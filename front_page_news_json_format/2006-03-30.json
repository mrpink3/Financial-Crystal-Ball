Since taking over as Exxon's chairman three months ago from Lee R.

The sporty coupe with a 289-cubic-inch engine growls, rumbles, vibrates and shakes when he puts his foot on the gas pedal.      But the Mustang, Mr. Elsden said, is not as zippy as his daughter's year-old sports wagon, a Nissan Murano, and accelerates hardly better than his wife's 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

In a clash of cultural icons, the Beatles' record company, Apple Corps, wants Apple Computer to stop using its familiar logo, in the shape of an apple with a bite out of it, on the iTunes Music Store. Apple Corps contends that the use of the logo infringes on a 1991 agreement, which it says barred Apple Computer from using the logo in connection with the sale of music.  ",
