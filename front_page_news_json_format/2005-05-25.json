      "abstract": "Front-runner in Iranian election is former Pres Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, pillar of Islamic Revolution who now casts himself as free-market reformist who could curb hard-line clerics and improve relations with US; Rafsanjani sounds less conciliatory in interview, saying US must make first concessions and defending Iran's right to develop nuclear technology; photos; he also says Iran, not US, has 'real democracy'; Rafsanjani embodies absurdities of election in country where political and social change is so popular that all candidates adopt reform vocabulary, even though none of eight allowed to run want to alter central fact of power resting in hands of unaccountable religious leader; Rafsanjani is considered compromise figure in lineup (M)",
