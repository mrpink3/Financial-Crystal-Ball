      "abstract": "Ernst v. Merck, the first Vioxx-related lawsuit to come to trial, is not over yet. But as the company begins to present its case after 14 days of testimony from plaintiffs, Merck appears to be in a deep hole.      It is always risky to handicap the outcome of a trial, of course. But Merck's expert witnesses may face a challenge in trying to turn the case -- especially since W. Mark Lanier, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, is known for his skill at cross-examination. He has had the benefit of presenting the personal, painful stories of family members left to grieve for the man whose death is at the center of the lawsuit. He is also armed with many of Merck's own documents that showed the company was concerned about Vioxx's safety several years before pulling the drug from the market.  ",
