The judge ruled that the federal law governing employer-provided health benefits takes precedence over the state law, which would have required companies with 10,000 or more workers to spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health insurance, or pay the difference into a state Medicaid fund.

''The Israeli attacks and airstrikes are completely destroying Lebanon's infrastructure,'' Mr. Maliki said at an afternoon news conference inside the fortified Green Zone, which houses the American Embassy and the seat of the Iraqi government.

If it is up enough, he raises the charge to haul produce across the country in his tractor-trailers.     A formula has evolved. For every 5-cent rise in the price of fuel, Mr. England's company, C. R. England Inc., based in Salt Lake City, adds 1 percent to its freight rates. Since 2003, those rates are up 37 percent, yet demand has not slackened.
