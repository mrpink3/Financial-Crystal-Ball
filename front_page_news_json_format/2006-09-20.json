PENSION FUND'S ALTERED OUTLOOK -- Until this week, it looked as if the $7.5 billion pension fund of San Diego County had a winning strategy for investing the retirement money of county workers. But much of the pension fund's strategy was based on a basket of hedge funds that included Amaranth Advisors. Now that Amaranth is in trouble, officials at the San Diego fund are remembering that the price of big returns is big risks. Page C4.    A MANAGER'S COMEDOWN -- Nicholas M. Maounis, the 43-year-old founder of Amaranth Advisors, rose rapidly from trader to billionaire hedge fund manager, and he impressed potential investors with his marketing pitches that stressed risk management and teamwork. But his once-golden reputation has suffered a severe blow now that his fund has lost more than $3 billion. Page C5.  ",

A Canadian teenager named Arthur Sicard came up with the idea for the snow blower in the late 1800's, while watching the blades on a piece of farm equipment, but he didn't sell any until 1927. For the next 30 years or so, snow blowers were hulking machines typically bought by cities and schools. Only recently have they become a suburban staple.  ",
