      "abstract": "As early as Friday, Japan's central bank is expected to take a momentous step in the nation's economic recovery by raising interest rates, effectively for the first time in almost two decades.     The move would send an important signal that Japan's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States, has finally emerged from a long bout of stagnant growth and falling prices. But paradoxically, economists say, the end of these ills brings a new challenge to Japanese consumers, who have not experienced a healthy economy since the 1980's.  ",
