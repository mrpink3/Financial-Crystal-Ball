      "abstract": "By the middle of this decade, Rick Wagoner promised a few years ago, General Motors would again be king of the American road.     The company would have dozens of new products aimed at beating foreign automakers, Mr. Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in 2002. With those new cars and trucks, G.M. would rebuild market share and its profits would help it stay ahead of the high cost of providing health care.  ",

      "abstract": "A day after winning a $27 billion takeover battle for the medical device maker Guidant, Boston Scientific received a harsh warning from federal health regulators on Thursday that cast doubt on the company's safety procedures and was expected to delay the introduction of new products.      The Food and Drug Administration said that Boston Scientific had repeatedly failed to advise the government of serious safety problems with its devices, as well as quality-control issues at factories. Officials said the problems affected every plant and every device made by Boston Scientific, whose best-selling product is the Taxus drug-coated stent that doctors use to keep coronary arteries propped open after blockages are removed.

The results, announced Thursday night, which give Hamas the right to form the next government, were likened by Palestinians to an earthquake or a tsunami.

In a sign that public opinion about the trade-offs between national security and individual rights is nuanced and remains highly unresolved, responses to questions about the administration's eavesdropping program varied significantly depending on how the questions were worded, underlining the importance of the effort by the White House this week to define the issue on its terms.

By 2008, another bout of bruising competition could begin as significant numbers of new aircraft start arriving, potentially swelling the domestic fleet.

Across the country, people will be following the case with great interest.      But in Houston, many residents prefer to focus on other things, like the resurgent economy, and city leaders wish outsiders would, too. The company, of course, is Enron, and the men who will be on trial are its former top executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, who face various charges in the scandal that led to the company's collapse and tarred this city's reputation four years ago.  ",
