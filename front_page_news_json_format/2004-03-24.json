      "lead_paragraph": "Euro Disney, Europe's largest theme park operator, said that creditors had given it two more months to renegotiate its loans, providing the unprofitable company time to avoid default. Euro Disney, which is 39 percent owned by the Walt Disney Company, has until May 31 to work out a plan with lenders to repay debt of 168 million euro ($207 million), which is due in June. Without a plan by then, it would be ''unable to meet all of its debt obligations,'' the company said. The waiver on existing loan commitments and a new credit facility from Walt Disney provided Euro Disney some respite after its loss widened last year on a slump in tourism. Investors said Euro Disney, based in Marne la Vall√©e, might turn to Disney -- which is facing shareholder criticism for its performance -- for help as it did in 1994.",
