The move is mostly to avoid tougher fuel economy and air pollution standards for cars.     Subaru's strategy highlights what environmentalists, consumer groups and some politicians say is a loophole in the nation's fuel economy regulations that has undermined the government's ability to actually cut gas consumption.

      "abstract": "Subaru is tweaking some parts of its Outback sedan and wagon to meet specifications of light truck, mostly to avoid tougher fuel economy and air pollution standards for cars; move will let Subaru sell more vehicles with turbochargers, which pep up performance but hurt mileage and increase pollution; Subaru's strategy highlights what environmentalists, consumer groups and some politicians say is loophole in fuel economy regulations that has undermined government's ability to actually cut gas consumption; average fuel economy for new vehicles is lower now than it was two decades ago, despite advances in fuel-saving technology; federal regulations originally set less-stringent fuel economy and emissions requirements for light trucks to avoid penalizing builders, farmers and other working people who rely on pickups; that exemption opened way for automakers to replace sedans and station wagons with vehicles that fit definition of light truck, notably sport utility vehicles and minivans; photos (M)",
