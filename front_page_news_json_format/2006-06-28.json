Some people write a $10,000 check to their alma mater and expect to get a plaque celebrating their generosity, and here was Mr. Buffett making a gift that will effectively send $10,000 to the Gates Foundation every three minutes for decades on end. For that amount of money, he could have founded Buffett University in his native Nebraska with an endowment larger than Harvard's, or he could have set up the world's richest foundation -- the Buffett Foundation -- and engaged in a little competitive philanthropy with his fellow bridge player Mr. Gates.
