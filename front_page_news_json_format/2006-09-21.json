The vote was not unanimous; there was one dissent. But the tone of the statement -- issued in the early afternoon, after a morning of debate and voting -- suggested that the policy makers were clearly satisfied with the decision they made at their last meeting, on Aug. 8, to halt a series of 17 consecutive rate increases stretching back two years. It also suggested that they would not change their view at their next meeting in late October, just before the midterm elections.  ",
