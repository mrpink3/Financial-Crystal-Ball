      "lead_paragraph": "The Elan Corporation, the Irish drug maker, said it lost $117.6 million in the second quarter, in contrast to a $17.3 million profit a year earlier, because it no longer receives income from products that it sold off to refocus its operations after an accounting scandal two years ago. Its revenues were cut nearly in half, to $116.2 million. Elan is likely to receive a ruling from the United States Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year on its application to sell Antegren, which it is developing with Biogen Idec, for treating multiple sclerosis.
