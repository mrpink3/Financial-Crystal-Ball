Then, in an unusual departure from Apple's practice of announcing new products when they are ready to ship, he talked about a product due out early next year that will be the company's first step into the living room. The device, which Apple is calling iTV for now, will plug into a television and wirelessly pull in video and music from a Macintosh computer in the den or from the Internet. The box, which will cost $299, is about the size of a slim paperback novel.  ",
