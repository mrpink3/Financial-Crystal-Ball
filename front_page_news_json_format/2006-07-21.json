      "abstract": "The morbid reality of Israel's bombing campaign of the south of Lebanon is reaching almost every corner of Tyre, a seaside city.     Abdelmuhsin al-Husseini, the mayor, announced yesterday that any bodies not claimed within the next two days by next of kin would be buried temporarily in a mass grave near the morgue until they could receive a proper burial once the fighting ends.     ''I am asking the families, if they can come here, to claim the bodies,'' said Mr. Husseini, whose bloodshot eyes hinted at his mad scramble to secure food rations and bring some order to the city. ''Otherwise, we have no choice but to bury them in mass graves.''     The morgue has had to order more than 100 coffins with special handles to make it easier to remove them from the ground to be reburied later.     United Nations peacekeepers left town yesterday, after loading United Nations employees, foreigners and Lebanese onto a ferry bound for Cyprus.       BY HASSAN M. FATTAH, PAGE A9",

Nor does its political wing, elected to the leadership in January, always seem to know what its well-armed military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, is planning. At least six other armed groups field soldiers to fight Israel. When there are no Israelis to fight, as was the case for several months, they sometimes turn on one another.     But the fighters -- estimated to be about 20,000 at most times and nearly double that when the fighting picks up -- have joined ranks in the latest conflict, with spokesmen for several of the groups saying that senior leaders of the seven militias are in constant communication with one another. Members of a cell in the Qassam Brigades, above, provided details on how their organization operated and how they tried to avoid Israeli detection and infiltration. They wore masks to hide their identities from possible collaborators.       BY CRAIG S. SMITH, PAGE A10",
