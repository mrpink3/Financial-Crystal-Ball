      "lead_paragraph": "Brazil's economy grew at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, fueled by a drop in interest rates and booming exports, the government said.

Agricultural output led the surge, jumping 6.4 percent from the year-earlier period, while industry grew 2.9 percent and services, 1.2 percent. Household consumption also bounced back after a long slump, rising 1.2 percent. Most economists expect the Brazilian economy to expand about 3.5 percent this year. Todd Benson (NYT)",

Yukos estimated that it should have $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents as of June 30, up from $800 million. Yukos has appealed the tax claim, and the court has said any attempt to collect the back taxes or fines must wait until Yukos has its hearing. That case is scheduled to begin today. Yukos also has 30 days to appeal the decision upholding the tax claim, which was returned Wednesday by the Moscow Arbitration Court.
