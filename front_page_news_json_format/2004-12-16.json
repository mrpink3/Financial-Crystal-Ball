He was jailed last year for his part in a $1.3 billion accounting fraud. Sovereign failed to vote Mr. Chey out of office at this year's annual meeting in March, and the refusal last month by SK's board to grant Sovereign's request for a shareholders meeting led Sovereign to ask the court to call the meeting. \"Today's decision, along with repeated refusals from the board of SK Corporation to allow shareholders a vote, demonstrates a continued reluctance to embrace meaningful reform,\" said James Fitter, Sovereign's chief executive.
