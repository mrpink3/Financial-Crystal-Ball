Mr. Moussaoui said he knew in advance of Al Qaeda's plans to fly jetliners into the World Trade Center and asserted that his role on that day was to have been to fly another plane into the White House. He said he was to have been accompanied on the suicidal mission by Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber who was convicted in a separate failed effort to blow up a plane in flight.  ",

Summers run from the end of June to the beginning of August.      Despite its remote location in the far north, Usinsk has some inherent advantages. An export terminal a few hundred miles away on the Arctic Ocean could supply tankers able to reach the United States in nine days. Building a pipeline to Europe would feed the high-quality oil directly to another ravenous market.  ",

Each day, workers report for duty at the plant and pass their time reading, watching television, playing dominoes or chatting.

It pays idled workers a full salary and benefits even when there is no work for them to do.  ",

Mr. Rivkin, who was a KPMG partner in San Diego, agreed to cooperate with the government as part of his plea. His cooperation may help federal prosecutors in Manhattan build a case against the remaining defendants as well as help prosecutors in their widening inquiry into other accounting firms, banks, law firms and others that worked with KPMG to sell bogus tax shelters, lawyers not involved in the case said.
