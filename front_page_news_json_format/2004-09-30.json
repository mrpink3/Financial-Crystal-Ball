The deal comes just two days after Air Canada said it would buy $821 million worth of jets from the Canadian plane maker Bombardier for its regional operating unit, Air Canada Jazz.

      "lead_paragraph": "Capital Radio, Britain's biggest commercial radio broadcaster, agreed to buy another broadcaster, the GWR Group, for about ¬£341 million ($618 million) to reduce costs and to increase advertising revenue. Capital Radio shareholders will own 52 percent of the combined company, and GWR's shareholders will own the rest. The companies have not yet picked a name for the new business, GWR's chairman, Ralph Bernard, said in a conference call with analysts. Combining GWR and Capital Radio will save at least ¬£7.5 million ($13.6 million) annually, the companies said. It may give them more power in negotiations with advertisers and reduce Capital Radio's dependence on its flagship station, 95.8 FM. The station is battling with Heart 106.2 of the Chrysalis Group to remain London's most popular station and to attract the highest ad rates.",
