In another report also suggesting that interest rates might not need to go much higher, the Commerce Department said construction of new homes slowed sharply in February from the frenetic pace set in January. The number of homes under construction continued to rise, though, reaching a 32-year high.  ",

The second thoughts signify a striking change in mood over one of President Bush's cherished tenets, pitting Republicans who call themselves realists against the neoconservatives who saw the invasion of Iraq as a catalyst for change and who remain the most vigorous advocates of a muscular American campaign to foster democratic movements.
