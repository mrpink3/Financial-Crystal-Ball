      "abstract": "Howard Dean marks first loss of his charmed political life with pledge that 'we will not quit now or ever'; appears before fiery crowd in West Des Moines, Iowa, waving American flag and shouting himself hoarse; appears to readopt some of growling, angry outsider tone that propelled his earlier insurgency, listing states where he plans to fight next rounds: New Hampshire, South Carolina, Massachusetts and North Carolina; until couple of weeks ago Dean seemed almost invincible and on his way to clear-cut victory in Iowa; his third-place finish comes after months of near-constant attacks by several of his Democratic rivals; endorsements from Sen Tom Harkin and former Vice Pres Al Gore, two of nation's largest unions and 35 members of Congress seemed to complicate Dean's message more than help spread it; many Democrats say Dean's remark following capture of Saddam Hussein, that United States was no safer, led many to question whether he could take on president on critical issue of terrorism (M)",
      "lead_paragraph": "He burst into the ballroom, fists thrust in the air, and slapped a string of high-fives with the dozens of labor union members standing onstage. He grabbed hold of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and yanked his hand up, too. He whipped off his suit coat and rolled his sleeves up as far as they would go.",

      "abstract": "Analysis of Iowa caucus results; for voters there, Sen John Kerry showed himself to be what he says he is: reassuring establishment candidate with war hero's record, solid policy positions and broad enough experience in government to be strong challenger to Pres Bush; surprise second-place showing by Sen John Edwards reflects voters' similar judgments about how he would compete against Bush, and makes him fresh force to contend with, especially in South Carolina; third-place finish of Howard Dean evaporates sense of inevitability he once sought, and his fiery concession speech contrasts sharply with Kerry's husky Iowa, I love you,' and Edwards's soft, smiling speech; Dean still has more money than any rival, strong operation in New Hamsphire, which votes next week, and legions of supporters who are sure to join him in fighting back; only definitive development in Iowa is Rep Richard A Gephardt's distant fourth-place finish, which spells end of his quest for White House and probably his political career (M)",
