In his toughest comments yet about the risks of inflation, Mr. Bernanke said consumer prices were rising faster than he would like. He gave short shrift to evidence of a slowdown in hiring, and he conspicuously avoided repeating his earlier suggestion that the Fed might consider a ''pause'' in its two-year program of steady interest rate increases.

      "abstract": "Federal regulators agreed yesterday to let the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri return to the market, despite its risk of causing a fatal brain disease, under a program intended to closely monitor doctors who prescribe it and patients who use it.      The drug was withdrawn early last year after only three months on the market, after its risks became evident, but a federal advisory panel recommended this past March that Tysabri be returned to the market. At that meeting, in sometimes tearful testimony, about two dozen people with multiple sclerosis told the committee they were willing to accept the risks of the drug because they viewed Tysabri as the best hope for slowing the progression of their debilitating disease. Tysabri's makers estimate that there may be as many as 150,000 multiple sclerosis patients in this country for whom other drugs are not effective.  ",
