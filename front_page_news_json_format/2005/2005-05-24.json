      "abstract": "Fifth article of series Class Matters examines high college dropout rate of low-income students at time when bachelor's degree tends to determine person's place in globalized, computerized economy; 41 percent of low-income students entering four-year college graduate within five years, compared with 66 percent of high-income students; Dept of Education finds that gap has grown over recent years; although many more students from all classes are getting four-year degrees and reaping their benefits, those broad gains mask fact that poor and working-class students have been falling behind; for them, not having degree remains the norm; once they take a break from college--phrase many use instead of drop out--they find that family and work make return to school seem even harder than finishing it in first place; colleges are trying to diversify their student rolls, leading some children of privilege to fear they are at disadvantage when they apply; but while athletes, legacy applicants and minority students are getting into elite colleges with lower scores on average, poor students are not; photos (L)",

      "abstract": "Supreme Court accepts its first abortion case in five years; case is likely to add even more heat to already superheated atmosphere surrounding court and its immediate future; case is appeal by State of New Hampshire of federal appeals court ruling that struck down parental-notification requirement for minors seeking abortions; case presents two questions court has not previously addressed in context of parental-notice laws: provisions for health concerns and what kind of challenges should be allowed to abortion laws that have not yet taken effect; court's answers could impact on its consideration of future abortion cases, including ones challenging recent federal law that prohibits procedure that abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion; that law has been declared unconstitutional in federal district courts around country; appeals by Bush administration are now pending in three federal appeals courts; cases are likely to reach Supreme Court in its next term, in what may be transitional time for court in view of likely retirement of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist; he has been consistent dissenter from court's decisions upholding right to abortion; his replacement would not be likely to shift balance on court; photo (M)",
