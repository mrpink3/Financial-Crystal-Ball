      "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration has received from the Guidant Corporation several new reports about recent patient deaths associated with short circuits in company heart devices, agency records show.     The three new cases all occurred after June when Guidant recalled the heart devices at issue. The recalls took place after the company came under scrutiny for failing to promptly warn doctors and patients about the risks of short circuits. The new reports bring the number of known deaths associated with the flaw to seven.  ",

A deal would create a utility behemoth with operations all along the East Coast, from Maine to Florida.     The talks come as deal-making in energy has reached feverish heights. Oil and gas deals alone have totaled $180 billion so far this year, the most activity since 1998, according to Thomson Financial.  ",

The storm destroyed 9 of 10 floating casinos in Biloxi, and the tenth suffered significant damage.      Yet so well financed is the gambling industry -- and so profitable the facilities that line the beaches here -- that one casino is set to open its doors to the public on Dec. 22. Another is to reopen the day after Christmas. A third, the Palace Casino, will have spent $23 million in four months to reopen by New Year's Eve, said the general manager, Keith Crosby.  ",

As expected, the Fed raised the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 4.25 percent, from 4 percent.

The ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, said at a news conference that ''over 100'' of the 169 detainees whom American troops found on Nov. 15 in an Interior Ministry bunker in the Jadriya neighborhood had been abused, a far higher figure than the Americans had previously disclosed. In the second raid last week, on another makeshift detention center run by a notorious police commando unit, the Wolf Brigade, as many as 26 of the 625 detainees jammed into the overcrowded center had been abused, Mr. Khalilzad said.
