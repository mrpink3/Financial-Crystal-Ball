      "abstract": "At 10 a.m. one Saturday in July, a few weeks after he finished his medical residency at Brown University, Ronak Shah married Kunal Patel, another doctor, in a union that embraced every ritual of the Hindu nuptial script.     Dr. Shah arrived at the Hanover Marriott in Whippany, N.J., by horse and carriage. He wore a traditional sherwani. And he greeted, before all others, his bride's mother, in a gesture that signified the importance of parental engineering in Indian marriage.  ",

Almost every week the federal government issues new rules or guidelines to carry out the 2003 law, which provides a drug benefit starting in January.

That left some Iraqis on the 275-member National Assembly wondering whether they were still in charge, and some Sunni leaders asserting that the delay was illegal.  ",
