They huddled in a room at the Waldorf-Astoria to go over a fairly formidable shopping list.

Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, is clearly counting on him to get multiple hits, and from multiple countries.

No, that's not a line from some updated version of ''To Tell the Truth.'' Those are the words of Sam E. Antar in a posting on the online accounting forum The New York Times set up after my June 25 column dealing with the continuing problems in the accounting profession. The central point of that column was that while accounting has improved in this post-Enron, post-WorldCom era -- largely because accountants have had the fear of God put in them -- the underlying systemic issues have not been confronted. As a result, I believe, the day will surely come when accountants and corporate executives stop worrying about going to jail, and accounting fraud makes a comeback.  ",

But since this is an equal-opportunity chasm, several people -- DJay; Key, a producer who records boring legal proceedings and has all but left his own commercial musical dreams behind; and Shelby, who creates rhythm tracks when he isn't stocking vending machines -- must all keep their day jobs.
