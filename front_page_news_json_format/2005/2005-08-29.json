Some providers like MCI have even started adding a ''paper bill'' fee to pay for the bill itself.      Some of the add-ons are new, like the ''property tax allotment,'' ''carrier cost recovery fee'' and ''single bill fee.'' Others, like the ''subscriber line charge,'' are growing as a portion of an average monthly bill.  ",

For more than 25 years, I've been coming up here to this little slice of paradise, and in that time, I've come to know a lot of the people around the lake, many of whom, of course, are businesspeople. I've become friends with a Toronto hedge fund manager, a Montreal chemical company executive, an Ottawa lobbyist and a general counsel for a Canadian multinational, among many others.     Naturally, whenever we get together, the subject turns to business -- Canadian business. We invariably hash over the latest trade frictions with the United States, which always garner front-page play in the Canadian papers and no play at all in the American papers. Although you probably haven't heard about it, there is an unusually nasty dispute going on now over softwood lumber, a major Canadian export that the United States believes is unfairly subsidized by the Canadian government.

A 28-year-old appraiser's apprentice from Reno, Nev., he extended his search all the way to a new development 20 miles north of downtown.
