      "abstract": "The White House sought with little success on Monday to quell an uproar over why it took the better part of a day to disclose that Vice President Dick Cheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas on Saturday and why even President Bush initially got an incomplete report on the shooting.     The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old lawyer, was transferred from the intensive care unit to a private room in a Corpus Christi hospital on Monday. He was listed as stable, with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cage from the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards away by Mr. Cheney's shotgun.  ",

      "abstract": "When Michelle Kwan tearfully announced on Sunday that a groin injury would force her to withdraw from the Olympics in Turin, she was acknowledging a painful reality: she would leave her third, and probably final, Olympics without a gold medal.     And unless Ms. Kwan's bubbly personality keeps endorsement deals coming, her early departure could also be bad news for her pocketbook. The 25-year-old figure skater's lucrative contracts with Coca-Cola and Visa are near an end -- and marketing experts say it is now less likely she will be landing big new deals anytime soon. Coca-Cola and Visa say they had no plans to use her beyond the Olympics.  ",

Thousands of local council positions were to be on the ballot.
