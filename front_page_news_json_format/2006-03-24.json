Skilling had supported a controversial off-the-books transaction as a way to skirt accounting rules, and admitted to other weaknesses in his earlier testimony.     But Ben F. Glisan Jr., the last high-level manager expected to testify for the government in the criminal trial of Mr. Skilling, a former Enron chief executive, and the company's founder, Kenneth L. Lay, continued to insist that the Raptors financing vehicle he designed had no economic value. Instead, Mr. Glisan said, the Raptors was really an accounting artifice that won plaudits from Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay for its ability to help Enron avoid reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

Democratic women are running major campaigns in nearly half of the two dozen most competitive House races where their party hopes to pick up enough Republican seats to regain control of the House.
