      "abstract": "Jill Carroll, the American reporter kidnapped in Baghdad nearly three months ago, was freed Thursday, saying she had spent most of her time in a small room but had been well treated by her captors.     Ms. Carroll, 28, was dropped off in a Sunni neighborhood in western Baghdad at midday and walked into the nearby offices of the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni political group, dressed in a light-green head scarf and gray dress. From there, she was taken to the Green Zone, the heavily fortified area in central Baghdad, where the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, said she was in ''good health and good spirits.''  ",

Al Qaeda, according to a newly revealed account from the chief plotter, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, took its time in choosing targets -- attack the White House or perhaps a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania? Organizers sized up and selected operatives, teaching them how to apply for a visa and how to cut a throat, a skill they practiced on sheep and camels. Despite the mistakes of careless subordinates and an erratic boss, Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mohammed tried to keep the plot on course.  ",
