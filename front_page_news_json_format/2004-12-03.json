      "lead_paragraph": "The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said that it would take a charge of 300 million Canadian dollars ($251 million) to cover costs from lawsuits related to its dealings with Enron, the bankrupt energy company. The bank said that the charge was a factor in a 14 percent decline in fourth-quarter income. Canadian Imperial, which is based in Toronto, said it earned 439 million Canadian dollars ($367 million) in the quarter. The Enron-related charge was expected. Canadian Imperial paid 80 million Canadian dollars to the Securities and Exchange Commission last year to settle fraud charges related to Enron. The bank also said that it had named Gerry McGaughey as president and chief operating officer. Ian Austen (NYT)",

      "lead_paragraph": "Nissan Motor may have to curb vehicle production again in March, after a temporary plant closing this month, because of a shortage of steel, the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said. In total, Nissan may be forced to reduce its production by as many as 40,000 vehicles because of the tight steel supplies, a loss that would reduce the company's profit by as much as 16 billion yen ($155 million), Mr. Ghosn said. Nissan has not been able to get enough steel because of higher-than-expected sales of some of its cars and because strong demand in China has left many steel makers with little capacity to raise output. Mr. Ghosn predicted that other Japanese automakers might also face shortages in March, typically the peak month for auto production in Japan. Todd Zaun (NYT)",

Mr. BollorÃ© said in a statement published on the Web site of the French stock market regulator that he had \"no immediate plans to take control\" of Havas. He owns the shares through his companies Groupe BollorÃ© and FinanciÃ¨re du Loch. The statement, which repeated one made on Oct. 22, came after Havas's board demanded that Mr. BollorÃ© clarify his intentions.",
