      "abstract": "Nearly seven months after Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and forced out hundreds of thousands of residents, most evacuees say they have not found a permanent place to live, have depleted their savings and consider their life worse than before the hurricane, according to interviews with more than 300 evacuees conducted by The New York Times.     The interviews suggested that while blacks and whites suffered similar rates of emotional trauma, blacks bore a heavier economic and social burden. And even as both groups flounder, most said they believed that the rest of the nation, and politicians in Washington, have moved on.  ",

In a quick remark at a White House news conference about the reserves of political strength he earned in his 2004 re-election victory -- ''I'd say I'm spending that capital on the war'' -- Mr. Bush in effect acknowledged that until he could convince increasingly skeptical Americans that the United States was winning the war, Iraq would overshadow everything he did.

The established carriers had filed one lawsuit after another against Southwest, then a little Texas discount airline, and each had failed. ''This litigation should have been terminated long ago,'' a federal appellate judge ruled. It had come to resemble ''harassment,'' he wrote.      But the big boys, especially American Airlines, still had one card to play. They persuaded Jim Wright, then the Democratic majority leader in the House, to pass a law that would shackle Southwest. Called the Wright Amendment, it restricted flights in and out of Love Field, the Dallas airport that was Southwest's home base, to destinations in five states: Texas and the four neighboring ones.
