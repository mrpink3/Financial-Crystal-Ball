With a unanimous vote, the five S.E.C. commissioners set in motion a plan that calls for companies to describe more clearly how their executives are compensated and to provide new information, like the lump-sum cost of retirement benefits and explanations of why specific stock option grants were approved. The rules will go into effect in mid-December, several months ahead of proxy season next year.  ",
