You know, like ''Whatever you buy today will look overpriced and underpowered next year,'' or ''The next version of Windows will be bigger than the previous one.''      Two such longstanding rules have just come tumbling down in the world of inexpensive digital S.L.R. (single-lens reflex) cameras. Digital S.L.R.'s are bigger and bulkier than the pocket cameras that most people buy, but they're photographically superior in every regard. They turn on instantly, take stunning magazine-quality photos, have zero shutter lag, can fire three shots a second, offer infinite manual control (white balance, exposure and so on), accept a catalog of lenses and go for days or weeks on a battery charge.
