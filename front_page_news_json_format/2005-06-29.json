      "abstract": "If ever a chief executive seemed destined for prison, it was Richard M. Scrushy.     Mr. Scrushy has always maintained his innocence. But at his trial, no one disputed that there was a staggering $2.7 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth, the company he helped found in 1984. Federal prosecutors lined up many former executives, including five former chief financial officers, to testify that Mr. Scrushy orchestrated the wrongdoing. In court, they played a secret tape-recording that seemed to incriminate him.  ",

Scrushy on all 36 counts, despite the testimony of more than half a dozen former lieutenants who said he had presided over a $2.7 billion accounting fraud while running the HealthSouth national hospital chain.    Some outside legal experts said the government might have erred in not seeking to hold the trial away from Birmingham, where Mr. Scrushy, 52, was well known for his lavish lifestyle and his generous philanthropy before he was fired in March 2003, as the scandal drove HealthSouth to the brink of bankruptcy.
