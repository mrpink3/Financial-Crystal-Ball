A former employee of Mr. Pellicano, who was charged in February with wiretapping and conspiracy, separately told the F.B.I. that Mr. Grey had met with the detective at least five times.  ",

      "abstract": "His emotions spilling over at times, Jeffrey K. Skilling admitted Thursday that he made mistakes at Enron, even as he continued to profess his innocence and blasted the government for charging him with conspiring to defraud Enron investors.     After nine weeks of listening to former colleagues and friends testify in federal court that he lied to Enron's investors and employees, Mr. Skilling, the former chief executive, fought back hard. On Thursday, his fourth day on the stand, he seemed righteously indignant in speeches deploring the fall of Enron, the former high-flying energy company that collapsed into bankruptcy in late 2001.

The company has pumped $6.4 billion into the pension fund over the last three years to make up for investment losses. And this year it took the big step of freezing the plan, reining in the growth of obligations to workers.     But for all that, a new study shows that if a proposed new accounting rule for pensions takes effect at the end of this year, as expected, I.B.M.'s balance sheet could be substantially weakened.  ",
