      "abstract": "In theory, what happened to 14-year-old Sibongile in this hilly, crowded township outside Durban in November could not happen today -- at least, not legally.     On a broiling Saturday morning, as more than a dozen women looked on, Sibongile joined 56 other Zulu girls outside a red-and-white striped tent. One by one, they lay on a straw mat beneath the tent; one by one, they received a cursory inspection of their genitals by a woman in a ceremonial beaded hat. As the inspector pronounced judgment on the state of each girl's hymen -- ''virgin,'' ''nice,'' ''perfect'' -- each departed to the excited trilling of the women who were observers.  ",

Meanwhile, the bond market, where short-term interest rates are now slightly above long-term rates in what is known as an inverted yield curve, suggests that the economy is headed for a sharp slowdown, perhaps even a recession.
