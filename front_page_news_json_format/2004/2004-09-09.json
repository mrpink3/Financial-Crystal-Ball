      "abstract": "Federal law banning sale of 19 kinds of semiautomatic assault weapons, which has widespread popular support, is expected to expire on Sept 13, result of intense lobbying by National Rifle Assn and complicated election-year politics of Washington; Pres Bush expressed support for legislation extending ban and said he would sign it into law, but he has not pressured lawmakers to act, leading critics to accuse him of trying to have it both ways; polls show two-thirds of Americans support efforts to renew ban; Republican leaders oppose ban; House majority leader Rep Tom DeLay claims ban would expire even if Bush made effort to renew it; Sen Dianne Feinstein, Democrat, scores Bush for saying he supports bill but failing to push for it; NRA, which has made overturning ban its top legislative priority, says law bans only 'cosmetic accessories' on guns, and does little other than place burden on gun manufacturers; news conference is held by supporters of ban, including police chiefs from around country and victims of gun violence and their relatives, who converge on Washington in last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to renew law; senior advisor to Sen John Kerry, who supports ban, signals that bill will become campaign issue; photo (M)",
