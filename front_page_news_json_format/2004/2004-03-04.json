While nothing could replicate the open-air spectacle of actually being there -- the crack of the bat, the cheering fans, the aroma of hot dogs and peanuts -- thousands of people toured the park, in a sense, long before it existed. They visited it virtually, gliding through a finely detailed, three-dimensional digital model.   ",
