The suit, bought by six women in 2001, accuses Wal-Mart of paying women less than men and offering fewer opportunities for promotion. Wal-Mart said it would appeal the class-action certification, arguing that it did not discriminate and that decisions about raises and promotion were made by individual stores, not on the corporate level.
