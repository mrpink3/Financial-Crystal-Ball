      "lead_paragraph": "Inflation in Brazil rose in October on surging fuel prices, reinforcing expectations that the central bank will increase interest rates next week for a third consecutive month. The government's statistics agency said its IPCA consumer price index rose 0.44 percent last month, up from a 0.33 percent increase in September. The reading brought the accumulated inflation rate this year to 5.95 percent, overshooting the government's year-end target of 5.5 percent. In the 12-month period that ended in October, the index rose 6.86 percent. Most economists expect the central bank to raise its benchmark lending rate, currently at 16.75 percent, by at least a quarter of a percentage point next Wednesday. Todd Benson (NYT)",
