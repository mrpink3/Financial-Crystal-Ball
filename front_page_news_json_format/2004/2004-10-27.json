      "lead_paragraph": "A Japanese Internet service provider, the Softbank Corporation, said it would acquire the Japanese unit of Cable & Wireless for 12.3 billion yen ($115 million) to expand a fledgling telecommunications business. The purchase of the unit, Cable & Wireless IDC, comes three months after Softbank entered the fixed-line communications business with an agreement to buy Japan Telecom for $3 billion. Both Cable & Wireless IDC and Japan Telecom serve mostly corporate clients. For Cable & Wireless, the sale marks a quiet end to what began as a high-profile investment in Japan. The company, based in London, shook up corporate Japan five years ago when it entered into and won a bidding war for International Digital Communications, or IDC, against the market leader, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone.
