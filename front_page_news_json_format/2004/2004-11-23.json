      "abstract": "European Commission, despite announcement by Thomson of plan to purchase one-third stake in ContentGuard, reportedly continues investigation into plan by Microsoft and Time Warner to take over antipiracy company; photo (S)",
      "lead_paragraph": "The European Commission is not automatically halting its investigation into a plan by Microsoft and Time Warner to take over the antipiracy specialist ContentGuard, a spokesman said, despite the arrival of a third merger partner, Thomson of France. Thomson announced plans to take a one-third stake in ContentGuard. The move would dilute the influence of Microsoft and Time Warner over ContentGuard. The European Commission said one of its main concerns about the deal was that it could allow Microsoft to take effective control of the merged entity. With a third equal partner this becomes impossible. However, the commission will continue with its investigation of the deal until it is officially notified about Thomson's inclusion, said Jonathan Todd, the commission's competition spokesman. Thomson's investment adds a \"European-headquartered partner that will make this important technology more accessible,\" Bill Gates, above, Microsoft's chairman, said in a statement.
