      "abstract": " Nasdaq Led Comeback For Stocks in 2003  Stocks broke their three-year slide with robust gains last year. But the market still has a way to go to return to the heights reached during the bubble that burst in 2000. Still, the year was a great relief to investors who had lived through a recession, an anemic recovery and the worst market decline since the 1970's.    For 2003, the Nasdaq composite index surged 50 percent, to 2,003.37, its third best year ever. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 26.4 percent, to 1,111.92, while the Dow Jones industrial average, which surged 6.9 percent in December, climbed 25.3 percent, to 10,453.92. [Page A1.]",
