      "lead_paragraph": "THE low point came in 1997, a year before personal computers and the Internet came to the libraries of Terrebonne Parish, a swatch of bayou country in South Louisiana, where people make their living on the water, harvesting shrimp and crabs or servicing oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Four of the nine branch libraries had been shut down for lack of funds, and the main library, a dreary concrete-slab building that locals nicknamed ''the bomb shelter,'' needed repairs and books.",

      "lead_paragraph": "The chip maker Infineon Technologies posted a net profit of 39 million euros ($46 million) for the second quarter ended March 31, in contrast to a loss of 328 million euros a year earlier. Cost cuts and greater demand for chips contributed to the gain. Sales rose 13 percent, to 1.67 billion euros ($1.98 billion). Max Dietrich Kley, above, the interim chief executive since Ulrich Schumacher was ousted by the supervisory board last month, said he expected annual sales to climb to 7 billion euros as the worldwide semiconductor market grows 22 percent this year. Infineon, based in Munich, said it had two candidates for chief executive. The company did not identify them but said both were German. Petra Kappl (NYT)",

Imports expanded 12 percent from the year, helped by growing consumption in Japan. Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 3.6 percent, largely because of an increase in orders by Japanese companies for airplanes made in the Untied States. Todd Zaun (NYT)",
