Lord Kirkham, who started the Doncaster, England-based company in 1969, raised his bid by 10 pence a share to 445 pence, to include money due from the settlement of a tax dispute, according to the Regulatory News Service. That was 7.2 percent more than an initial 415 pence-a-share offer he made in March. Lord Kirkham has cited increasing competition as the reason for taking the company private. DFS in April said annual profit will fall almost 10 percent as British clothing retailers like Next and the Marks & Spencer Group add furniture lines and some mass retailers cut prices.",
