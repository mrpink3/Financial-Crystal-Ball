      "abstract": " Merck Sets Up Bonus Plan For 230 Senior Executives  With its stock falling since it withdrew the arthritis drug Vioxx and its ability to thrive as an independent company uncertain, Merck has adopted a plan to give its executives a chance for bonuses if the company is taken over.    Merck said in a securities filing that its board had decided to give its 230 most senior managers the opportunity for a payment of up to three years of salary and bonus if another company buys Merck -- or merely buys more than 20 percent of its shares. [Page A1.]    Another Purchase by UnitedHealth  UnitedHealth said that it would buy Definity Health for $300 million. The acquisition was the latest move in the company's strategy of diversifying away from its signature managed care business. Earlier this year, UnitedHealth acquired Oxford Health Plans and Mid-Atlantic Medical Services. Shares of UnitedHealth are up 42.6 percent so far this year. Market Place.

[World Business, Section W.]    Kellogg Picks Director as Chief  James M. Jenness, left, was named chairman and chief executive of Kellogg to succeed Carlos M. Gutierrez, who was nominated by President Bush to be commerce secretary. Mr. Jenness has been a Kellogg director since 2000 and serves as head of the board's consumer-marketing committee. He was once a vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Leo Burnett Company. [C4.]    Editor of Le Monde Steps Down  The editor in chief of Le Monde, Edwy Plenel, resigned from the paper, which has been struggling with a downturn in advertising and circulation. [World Business, Section W.]    Wal-Mart Appeals Earlier Ruling  Wal-Mart Stores asked an appeals court to overturn a ruling allowing 1.6 million women workers seeking back pay to sue the company for discrimination as a group. [C12.]    S.&P. and Dow Fall; Nasdaq Gains  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.08 points, to 1,178.57, on disappointing November sales at Wal-Mart. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 46.33 points, to 10,475.90.
