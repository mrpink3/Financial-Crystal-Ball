      "abstract": "Russian Tax Ministry claims added $10 billion in back taxes from oil company Yukos, bringing company's total back tax bill to $17.5 billion (S)",
      "lead_paragraph": "The Russian Tax Ministry served the oil company Yukos with claims for an additional $10 billion in back taxes, which would bring the company's total tax bill to $17.5 billion. Tax officials with the ministry finished an audit for Yukos for 2002, and as a result demanded 193 billion rubles ($6.7 billion) for that year, the Interfax news agency reported. Earlier, Yuganskneftegaz, the main production unit of Yukos, received a $3.3 billion back-tax claim, $2.3 billion for unpaid taxes in 2001 and $1 billion for 2002. As part of the Russian government's campaign against the company, the country's largest oil producer, Yukos already faced total back-tax claims of about $7.5 billion for the years 2000 and 2001. The company has almost fully repaid the $3.4 billion for 2000. The founder of Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, is in jail facing trial on separate criminal charges, and his detention was extended on Monday to Feb. 14 from Nov. 14. Erin E. Arvedlund (NYT)",
