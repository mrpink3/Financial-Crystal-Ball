      "lead_paragraph": "The British economy expanded at the fastest annual pace in three and a half years in the first quarter, strengthening the case for higher interest rates. Real gross domestic product grew 3.4 percent from a year ago in the first three months of the year, more than an earlier estimate of 3 percent, the government said. Quarterly growth rates in each of the last four quarters increased one-tenth of a percentage point. The rate was 0.7 percent in the first quarter -- the strongest since the third quarter of 2000. The National Statistics office said it increased the quarterly rate of growth because of higher estimates for taxes on products.",
