Stein Jr. could not have been clearer about his feelings toward the American businessman who was receiving millions of dollars in contracts from Mr. Stein to build a major police academy and other reconstruction projects in Iraq.

      "abstract": "In surprising testimony on Wednesday, Enron's former head of investor relations said that the company fudged its quarterly earnings and repeatedly lied to Wall Street about the true condition of its troubled broadband services division to keep its stock price soaring.     Mark E. Koenig, the first witness to take the stand in the criminal trial of Enron's former chief executives Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K.

Their cotton tent had collapsed on top of them in the night under a heavy snowfall, so for four nights, they huddled in the open on a rope bed by a fire.

      "abstract": "Industry experts say that if President Bush wants to make a push to reduce the country's oil consumption, there are some solutions at hand. But with names like carbon composites and new metal alloys, they may seem banal and do not create much buzz.     Perhaps the most significant step the nation could take in reducing oil dependence is to change the way cars are produced, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy research organization that has consulted for the Department of Defense. Automobiles, for instance, use about 9 million barrels of the 20 million barrels or so of oil that the United States consumes each day. Trucks, heavy machinery and some power plants consume the rest.  ",

On the day after he declared in his State of the Union address that the United States was ''addicted to oil'' and had to wean itself from a century-old habit, Mr. Bush drew some support for putting the issue more prominently on the agenda but also skepticism about how achievable his goals really were.
