      "abstract": "Despite hours of confrontational interviews by the White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, the Bush administration failed to get a full picture of the legal and ethical problems of Bernard B. Kerik, its nominee for homeland security secretary, a government official said on Tuesday.    In addition, the White House did not consult with the one person in the West Wing who knew the most about Mr. Kerik's background, Frances Townsend, because Ms. Townsend, President Bush's adviser on homeland security and a former federal prosecutor in New York, was under consideration for the position herself, said the official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

While the rate is below the initial level of 27.2 percent, the tariff in the decision was higher than a rate proposed in an interim ruling issued in June. It is still not high enough for the United States lumber industry, which contends that Canadian producers are subsidized because they mainly harvest timber from government-owned forests. Barry Cullen, the executive director of the Coalition for Fair Lumber imports, said his group would probably appeal the ruling to a Nafta dispute settlement panel. The Canadian government had no immediate comment. Ian Austen (NYT)",
