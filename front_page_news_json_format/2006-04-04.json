Domenici, a curly-haired mother of four and a local PTA president who also happened to be an illegal immigrant from Italy.

It marked the board's first public comment on Mr. Wagoner since a spate of recent bad news, but analysts said it did not indicate unconditional backing. Indeed, accounting missteps prompted a board investigation two weeks ago after one error forced G.M. to increase its losses in 2005 by $2 billion, to $10.6 billion.  ",
