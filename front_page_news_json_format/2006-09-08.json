The city's Human Rights Commission found that hiring of black workers had barely improved since an inquiry found similar problems 40 years ago. Of 8,000 employees working for 16 agencies the commission examined, Patricia L. Gatling, chairwoman of the commission, said about 22 percent make more than $100,000 a year, and only 2.5 percent of those are black.  ",

It seems that Hewlett-Packard's chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, was angry that somebody had been leaking information she wanted kept secret.

      "abstract": "The Bush administration's proposal to bring leading terrorism suspects before military tribunals met stiff resistance Thursday from key Republicans and top military lawyers who said that some provisions would not withstand legal scrutiny or do enough to repair the nation's tarnished reputation internationally.     Democrats, meanwhile, said they were inclined to go along with Senate Republicans drafting an alternative to the White House plan, one that would allow defendants more rights. That left Republicans to argue among themselves about what the tribunals would look like, and threatened to rob the issue of the political momentum the White House hoped it would provide going into the closely fought midterm elections.
