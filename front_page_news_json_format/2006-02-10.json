Harper's Bazaar offers ''783 new ideas to flatter you.'' Marie Claire trumpets not only ''71 easy hair and makeup how-tos'' but a mind-blowing ''1,157 hot looks (all shapes, all sizes, all prices).''      Magazines, particularly the ''service'' publications aimed at women, have long used numbers as a selling point while helping readers divine what's in, what's hot, what's cool, what's not. But today, these totals, scores and inventories seem both increasingly random and increasingly increasing, leaping exponentially beyond the sorry single digits of yesteryear to an incalculable proliferation of paths to a better you.

      "abstract": "It has been a trend in American living rooms for decades: every year, the cable television bill goes up as consumers receive ever more channels they do not want or cannot find the time to watch.     But in a frontal assault on business as usual, the Federal Communications Commission, in a report issued yesterday, said consumers would save as much as 13 percent on their cable bills if they could buy only the channels they wanted instead of being forced to pay for hundreds of them. The average household, the F.C.C. said, watches only 17 channels.  ",
