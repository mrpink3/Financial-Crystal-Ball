      "abstract": "Just four years ago, Argentina's economy was prostrate and its politics in chaos, after a financial crisis resulted in bank deposits being frozen, the government defaulting on more than $100 billion in debt and five presidents holding office in two weeks. But on Tuesday, the country is expected to pay off the last of its debt to the International Monetary Fund and simply walk away from further negotiations with the group.     Argentina still owes tens of billions to private lenders, even after a debt restructuring in March. But the $9.8 billion payment is an important symbolic milestone and just one of several recent signs that President Néstor Kirchner appears to be concentrating more power in his own hands and steering his government to the left. Since a midterm election victory in October, Mr. Kirchner has also moved to establish an alliance with Venezuela's populist leader, Hugo Chávez, and, as a traditional Peronist, to extend the hand of the state deeper into the economy, the judiciary and the news media.

      "abstract": "Facing cuts in antiterrorism financing, the Department of Homeland Security plans to announce today that it will evaluate new requests for money from an $800 million aid program for cities based less on politics and more on assessments of where terrorists are likely to strike and potentially cause the greatest damage, department officials say.     The changes to the program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, are being driven in part by a reduction in the overall pool of money for antiterrorism efforts. For 2006, Congress has appropriated $120 million less in these urban grants than for 2005.  ",

      "abstract": "Faced with mounting criticism from its natural gas customers across Western Europe, Russia on Monday restored most of the gas it withheld from Ukraine's pipeline system a day earlier in a pricing dispute.     Officials of the state-owned Russian company, Gazprom, presented the decision not as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine's ''theft'' of natural gas. But it became clear almost immediately that the driving force in Russia's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe, including countries like Germany that are usually reliable allies.  ",

The Federal Reserve has already significantly tightened monetary policy in the United States.

Given the increasing understanding among adoption experts of the health risks facing orphans in certain developing countries, scanning a photo of a child has become a common practice, more reliable for finding abnormalities like fetal alcohol syndrome, which smooths the groove between mouth and nose, than for detecting imperceptible risks, like attention deficit disorder.
