Our transportation was a borrowed Volkswagen, and friends scattered around the country put us up on spare beds or sofas. Entertainment came from a carefully planned schedule of minor league baseball games and from whatever else caught our eye along the way.     The first trip, in 1992, went so well that it became a near-annual tradition. By the time we stopped it eight years later, we had been to both coasts, the Smoky Mountains, the Great Plains, the Herbert Hoover museum and perhaps the nation's finest ballpark food stand, a barbecue pit in Stockton, Calif. On a good day, we spent $50 between us.  ",

Sharp disapproval of President Bush's handling of gasoline prices has combined with intensified unhappiness about Iraq to create a grim political environment for the White House and Congressional Republicans.     Mr. Bush's approval ratings for his management of foreign policy, Iraq and the economy have fallen to the lowest levels of his presidency. He drew poor marks on the issues that have been at the top of the national agenda in recent months, in particular immigration and gasoline prices.  ",
