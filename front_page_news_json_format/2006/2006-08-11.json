      "abstract": "Republicans seized on the arrests of terror suspects in Britain to bolster a White House campaign to turn national security issues to their advantage this fall, arguing that the nation needs tough Republican policies to protect Americans from threats from abroad.     Democratic and Republican officials alike said they viewed the arrests as critical in determining how they would approach the fall campaign.      The developments played neatly into the White House-led effort -- after Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, was defeated in a primary on Tuesday by an antiwar challenger -- to remind voters of the threats facing the nation and to cast Democrats as timid on national security issues.
