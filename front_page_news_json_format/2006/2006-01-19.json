Chicago's smoking ban took effect this week, but it was hard to know that from inside the gleaming lounge along Milwaukee Avenue in a hip neighborhood on the North Side. Here, under glass, are thick jars of tobacco -- Oriental Rose, The Empress, The Earl -- poured lovingly into white smoking papers by tobacco's answer to the coffee shop barista.  ",

The bodies of the men have not been recovered, but the two officials said the Pakistani authorities had been able to establish through intelligence sources the names of three of those killed in the strikes, and maybe a fourth. Both of the officials have provided reliable information in the past, but neither would be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.  ",

      "abstract": "Benefiting from brisk holiday sales of iPod music players, Apple Computer reported on Wednesday that its profit nearly doubled in the first quarter. But its outlook for the second quarter fell well below Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to fall as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.      Apple's report came after disappointing forecasts from Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday sent the technology sector into a sell-off that continued into Wednesday. EBay's outlook, announced late Wednesday, also fell short of expectations, and its after-hours trading suffered. [Page C6.]  ",

      "abstract": "In its first ruling on an abortion case in six years, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on Wednesday that reaffirmed the need to include an exception for medical emergencies in a law that restricts teenagers' access to abortion.      The decision told a lower court to reconsider its ruling that struck down, in its entirety, a New Hampshire law that fails to include such an exception. ''We try to limit the solution to the problem,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in her opinion for the court, instructing the lower court to consider invalidating the law only as it applies to those few teenagers who need an immediate abortion for medical reasons.

Or is Takafumi Horie simply a 33-year-old crook who fooled investors with fake numbers?

Cisneros is finally closing his operation with a scathing report accusing Clinton administration officials of thwarting an inquiry into whether Mr. Cisneros evaded paying income taxes.     The legal inquiry by the prosecutor, David M. Barrett, lasted more than a decade, consumed some $21 million and came to be a symbol of the flawed effort to prosecute high-level corruption through the use of independent prosecutors.  ",

Music iPod, then video iPod.      And then, of course, there's Apple's iTunes Music Store. The day it began selling videos, too, was the first time that cowering TV executives ever climbed down off of their kitchen tables and allowed somebody to use ''TV show'' and ''Internet'' in the same sentence. It was a small, timid test -- only five TV series from one network at first, only in the United States, at low resolution and with copy protection -- but it was a spectacular success. TV fans bought about eight million videos in the first three months of the service.  ",
