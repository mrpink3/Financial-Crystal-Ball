The company said that the shift, which is expected to spur still more major companies to move away from traditional defined-benefit pension plans, would save it as much as $3 billion through the next few years and provide it with a ''more predictable cost structure.''

      "abstract": "As he huddled with 11 fellow miners trying to shelter from poisonous air in one of the farthest reaches of the Sago Mine, Martin Toler Jr. took an insurance form and a pencil from his pocket. In faint sentences of farewell and religious conviction, he let his family know that death, as it approached, came gently.     ''Tell all -- I see them on the other side,'' Mr. Toler, a 51-year-old mine foreman, wrote. Nearby were the words, ''It wasn't bad, I just went to sleep.'' And at the bottom, ''I love you.''  ",

      "abstract": "The White Buffalo Calf Woman Society, a shelter for battered women in tiny Mission, S.D., is far removed from the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal that rocked Washington this week. But the society, along with many other charities large and small, is among the latest beneficiaries of Mr. Abramoff's legendary largess.     As panicked lawmakers rush to distance themselves from Mr. Abramoff, the disgraced Republican lobbyist, after his guilty pleas in federal and Florida state courts, tens of thousands of dollars in political donations from him and his Indian tribe clients are being returned or redirected to charities in a vast Robin Hood-like reordering of campaign funds.
