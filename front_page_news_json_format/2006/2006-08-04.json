The prisoner, Samir Kuntar, was part of a cell that in 1979 raided an apartment building in the northern Israeli town of Nahariya, terrorizing the Haran family. Mr. Kuntar shot Danny Haran in the head, killing him, while his daughter, Einat, 4, watched, then smashed the girl's head in with his rifle butt, killing her as well. Mr. Haran's wife, Smadar, hid in the attic with their 2-year-old daughter, so afraid that the girl would cry out that she accidentally suffocated the girl to death.  ",

Republican backers of the measure, dubbed the trifecta for its three chief elements, fell 4 votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate.

      "abstract": "Merck is gaining ground in the Vioxx litigation -- at least for the moment. On Wednesday, a California jury ruled that Merck's painkiller Vioxx did not cause the heart attack that Stewart Grossberg, who is now 71, had in September 2001. The case was Merck's second consecutive victory, following a win for the company in New Jersey last month.     Lawyers on both sides agree that Merck's victories, and its stated strategy of trying every case rather than settling any, are discouraging plaintiffs with weaker claims. Already, lawyers for plaintiffs have recently withdrawn more than 300 federal suits, mainly after finding that their clients could not produce adequate evidence that they took the drug.  ",
