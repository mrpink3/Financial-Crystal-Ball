Everyone wants it rebuilt as soon as possible. But officials on one side of the bridge -- those in Biloxi -- favor a large, multilane structure that can accommodate casino workers and the new horde of gamblers. On the other side, in Ocean Springs, officials want to restore the four-lane drawbridge that once spanned the bay, hoping to keep their French-colonized, tree-lined town the definition of quaint.  ",
