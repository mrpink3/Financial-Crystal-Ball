But he ran into renewed resistance from conservatives who said they were not swayed by the case he made Monday to give many illegal workers a chance to become citizens.     The administration began an effort to build support for the president's approach, including putting Vice President Dick Cheney on Rush Limbaugh's syndicated radio program to try to mollify conservatives. Mr. Bush's plan combines a pledge of enhanced border security, backed by the deployment of up to 6,000 National Guard troops, with the creation of a temporary guest worker program and an opportunity for illegal immigrants who meet certain standards to gain legal status.
