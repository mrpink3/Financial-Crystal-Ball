But that obscures a less well-known fact: Shanghai has the oldest population in China, and it is getting older in a hurry.     Twenty percent of this city's people are at least 60, the common retirement age for men in China, and retirees are easily the fastest growing segment of the population, with 100,000 new seniors added to the rolls each year, according to a study by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

      "abstract": "Israeli troops seized 64 members of Hamas in the West Bank on Thursday, including a third of the Palestinian cabinet and 23 legislators, a move that Israeli officials said indicated a significant change in Israel's policy toward the Hamas government.     The seizures are partly intended to warn Hamas leaders that they could lose their power and liberty, if not their lives, unless they act to release a captured Israeli soldier, a senior Israeli military official said. But Israel has also concluded that Hamas, which had largely kept to a cease-fire before, is now openly engaged in violent acts against Israel and must be treated differently.  ",

      "abstract": "A few miles north of Rotterdam, in a region the Dutch call ''glass city'' for its thousands of greenhouses, gardeners like Frank van Os are part of an unconventional experiment by Royal Dutch Shell to curb carbon emissions.     Mr. van Os produces four million roses each year, flooding the atmosphere inside his vast glass canopy with pure carbon dioxide to bolster his crop. What is unusual is that he now gets the carbon dioxide piped in directly from Pernis, a Shell refinery that is Europe's largest and typically discharges tons of the gas into the atmosphere every year.

As expected, the central bank raised its crucial lending rate another quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, and left itself room to raise it again before stopping. But for the first time since it began lifting rates two years ago, the Fed stopped short of signaling that further interest rate increases were all but certain.  ",

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.2 percent -- its biggest one-day gain in almost three years. The other major benchmarks also rose 2 percent or more. Advancing issues led declining ones by more than five to one on the New York Stock Exchange. Treasury prices and crude oil also rose.  ",
