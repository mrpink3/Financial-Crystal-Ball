      "abstract": "Wal-Mart Stores, facing a raft of state bills that would require it to increase spending on employee health insurance, plans to ease several longstanding -- and heavily criticized -- restrictions on who is eligible for benefits, the company said yesterday.     Wal-Mart said that for the first time it would permit part-time employees to enroll their children in the health insurance plan, and it pledged to reduce significantly the waiting period before a new part-time employee is eligible for benefits, though it declined to specify the reduction.

      "abstract": "The Dubai company at the center of a political furor over its plans to take over some terminal operations at six American ports said Thursday night that it planned to close the deal next week but that it would ''not exercise control'' over its new operations in the United States while the Bush administration tried to calm opposition in Congress.     The statement may provide a little time and political breathing room for President Bush, who has appeared taken by surprise at the opposition from Republicans and Democrats alike over the deal involving one of the country's few close Arab allies. But it was not clear how long the company was willing to suspend control over its new American properties or whether its offer would assuage the members of Congress, governors and mayors who have vowed to block the deal.

      "abstract": "A groundswell of sectarian fury continued to roil Iraq on Thursday after Wednesday's bombing of a major Shiite shrine, leaving at least 138 people dead in the past two days and political negotiations over a new government in ruins.      The threat of full-scale civil war loomed over the country as Sunni politicians lashed out at Shiite leaders on Thursday, accusing them of igniting anti-Sunni reprisals, and at the American military, charging it with standing idly by as the violence erupted. The most powerful Sunni Arab political group said it was suspending talks with Shiite and Kurdish politicians on forming a new government.  ",

Those are issues that have divided auditors from regulators for years. Auditors in the United States lost some, but not nearly all, of their other activities under the Sarbanes-Oxley law passed in 2002 in response to the Enron fraud, but that reflected their decreased political influence more than it did a careful analysis of real-world results.
