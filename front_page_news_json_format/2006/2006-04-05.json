The panel is expected to issue a ruling by April 15.     The decision by the pilots gives negotiators on both sides more than a week to narrow their differences and avoid a work stoppage that many believe would lead to a liquidation of Delta. Among the issues is the company's request for $305 million in annual pay cuts; the pilots have offered $140 million.  ",
