The abrupt drop, which was the largest since January, came after several days of modest but steady increases in the Dow Jones industrial average, which as recently as Wednesday was within 80 points of its record high. It also came a day after the Federal Reserve indicated that it was ambiguous about whether it would raise rates later this year.  ",

A federally mandated shift to a more ozone-friendly version of the hand-held inhalers used to quell asthma attacks is creating spot shortages of the devices, because production of the older versions has declined even before producers of the new inhalers ramp up fully. The shift is also giving a few drug makers the rare chance to introduce brand-name medicine into a market long dominated by low-cost generics.  ",
