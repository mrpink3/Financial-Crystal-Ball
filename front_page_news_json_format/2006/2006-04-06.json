But they will get a significant raise if earnings perform as expected.     While many companies give directors all or part of their pay in stock or stock options, Coca-Cola appears to be the first to have adopted a plan that would provide nothing if the company did not perform well.

But it wasn't the first such program, it's not the most feature-laden, and it's still a mystery to most people over 25.     Yet somehow, Skype is changing everything. Twenty-five million people are using it to make free calls, much to the annoyance of the phone companies. College students call home and friends with it. Business travelers keep in touch with the family. Visitors to the United States chit-chat with their buddies in Europe, Japan or wherever. The software -- free from skype.com and available for Mac, Windows, Linux and PocketPC -- is pitifully easy to use, and the sound quality is more like FM radio than a phone call.  ",

Laying out her options -- whether to stay on at NBC, where she had achieved enormous success as a co-host of ''Today,'' or to join CBS, which was offering her the position of anchor of the evening newscast -- Ms. Couric explained to her daughters that should she take the CBS job her schedule would change radically from morning work hours to evening work hours and certainly the family routine of early dinners together would be disrupted.

Separately, jurors found that Merck had committed consumer fraud against Mr. McDarby, 77, and Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the case, who suffered a heart attack in 2003.
