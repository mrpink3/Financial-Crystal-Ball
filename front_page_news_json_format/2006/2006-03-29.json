      "abstract": "As the justices of the Supreme Court took their seats Tuesday morning to hear Osama bin Laden's former driver challenge the Bush administration's plan to try him before a military commission, one question -- perhaps the most important one -- was how protective the justices would be of their jurisdiction to decide the case.

As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards.

      "abstract": "In 1992, with General Motors in the worst financial crisis in its storied history, its board ousted top management and brought in a fresh slate of executives with orders to burst through the automaker's turgid culture.      The youngest was its 39-year-old chief financial officer, Rick Wagoner, a virtual unknown outside the company who was as shocked as everyone else when he was summoned back from G.M.'s operations in Brazil for a post that usually went to men a decade or two his senior. He helped fashion a turnaround plan that stemmed the bleeding and put G.M. back on the road to profitability.  ",

It was called Operation Match, and it sent questionnaires to college campuses around the country. ''There were stacks of them as you went into the dorms,'' Ms. Brereton remembered. Students rated their own looks, intelligence and interests on a scale from one to five and described their ideal date using the same measures. They then returned the survey, along with a $3 fee, to the Operation Match offices in Cambridge, Mass.  ",
