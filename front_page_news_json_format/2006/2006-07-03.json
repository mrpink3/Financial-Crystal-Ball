Zocor, of course, is Merck's big cholesterol-lowering drug, which last year generated $4.4 billion for the company. As Alex Berenson pointed out in The New York Times, that makes Zocor ''the largest-selling drug yet to be opened to generic competition.''     Not long ago, a big pharmaceutical company like Merck would have rolled over and played dead once its ''branded'' drug lost patent protection. For the first six months after the patent's expiration, the company would probably have maintained its old monopoly price, while a single generic drug maker, which had gained the right to sell its version exclusively for 180 days, undercut it by, say, 20 percent. After the six months were up, and half a dozen generic companies started making their own versions of the drug, the price would ''fall off the cliff,'' in the words of the generic drug expert Tim Van Biesen of Bain & Company. At which point, the branded drug would fade into oblivion.  ",

But Mr. Vallado, who has been installing television services for two decades, now works for the phone company -- AT&T -- not the local cable provider. Hunched over a cable box outside a customer's suburban two-story home in a gated community here, he plugs in adapters and a bunch of wires that will turn on AT&T's new television service, U-verse.

      "abstract": "When Google was a graduate-school project being run from a Silicon Valley garage, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, built their own computers out of cheap parts meant for personal computers. They wanted to save money, and they felt that they could design a network of computers that would search the Web more efficiently than those available from traditional manufacturers.     Google no longer needs to pinch pennies. It is a solid member of the Fortune 500 with $9 billion in cash. Still, it is stubbornly sticking to its do-it-yourself approach to technology. Even as it spends more than $1.5 billion this year on operations centers and technology, most of the hundreds of thousands of servers it will deploy are being custom-made based on Google's own eccentric designs.

      "abstract": "After years of competitive and often contentious dealings, President Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona are building a deepening if impersonal relationship that is serving the political needs of both men.     Given their history of intense rivalry and sometimes personally bitter combat, their newfound partnership is seen by some Republicans as born more of political calculation than personal evolution. Either way, it could prove valuable to Mr. McCain in his efforts to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 by sending a signal to Mr. Bush's conservative base and fund-raising network that, at a minimum, the White House will not stand in the Arizonan's way.
