Mr. Lemonnier is out in front on a seismic shift in the way Europeans work, one that is provoking the rapid decline of the traditional full-time job.

''There's a need for flexibility,'' said Mr. Lemonnier, 47, the president of Manpower France, the temporary staffing company. ''Firing, on economic grounds, in a company with more than nine people, is extremely complicated. So temporary work is the simplest solution for the companies.''  ",
