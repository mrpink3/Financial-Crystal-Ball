That may not be what companies try to do, but all too often it happens when they set out to buy the asset you might think they would know best: their own shares.     When that occurs, the result is perverse. Companies, particularly ones that pay no dividends, wind up providing cash to shareholders who were disloyal (or wise) enough to bail out. Those who followed the old advice of ''buy and hold'' get no cash, and they suffer more than they would have if the company had not purchased overvalued stock.  ",
