      "abstract": "A group of oil companies led by Chevron, which said last week that they had discovered a huge new oil field in the Gulf of Mexico, could avoid more than $1 billion in royalty payments to the federal government for the oil.     The potential bonus to Chevron and its partners stems from a mistake the Interior Department made in signing offshore leases in the late 1990's for drilling in federal waters. The magnitude of the oil discovery -- estimated in a range of 3 billion to 15 billion barrels -- is likely to intensify a battle in Congress over incentives for drilling in publicly owned waters.  ",
