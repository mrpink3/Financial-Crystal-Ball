Paulson Jr. pondered whether to leave the job he loves at Goldman Sachs for a new position of uncertain power at the Treasury, he received some crucial advice earlier last month from James A.

It is not every day that a Wall Street chief executive gets career counseling from a Washington power broker like Mr. Baker. But for Mr. Paulson, the words of wisdom represented a payoff of sorts from a series of relationships he has forged with Washington insiders through the counsel of his chief of staff and closest adviser at Goldman Sachs, John F. W. Rogers.  ",
