      "abstract": "Germany, after four years of stagnation, is showing signs of reclaiming its role as the economic engine of Europe. And much of the credit goes to old-line German companies like the printing press manufacturer named for this ancient university town.     Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's largest maker of printing presses, was flat on its back two years ago, the victim of a downturn in the media industry and of Japanese rivals that undercut its prices. Now, after painful therapy that included 3,500 layoffs, the company is humming again.  ",

Yanukovich, the chosen heir of a discredited and unpopular government, who would have been president but for those huge street demonstrations and international diplomatic pressure.  ",

He had made his biggest public splash in 2003, when he ordered the House cafeteria to start calling French fries ''freedom fries'' because France had opposed the war in Iraq.

      "abstract": "Two new approaches to weight loss are up for review by federal regulators. And they represent vastly different solutions to the nation's obesity epidemic -- for consumers and for the companies behind the drugs.     One, called Acomplia, would be a prescription pill to control appetite by blocking the same brain receptors that stimulate the ''munchies'' in marijuana smokers. Some financial analysts see Acomplia as the most promising new drug of the year, and they predict multibillion-dollar sales eventually for its maker, the French company Sanofi-Aventis.  ",
