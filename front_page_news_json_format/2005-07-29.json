      "lead_paragraph": "HOUSTON, July 28 - The Discovery astronauts worked through their second full day in orbit on Thursday, executing an elegant orbital back flip and docking with the International Space Station. Back on Earth, hundreds of engineers scrutinized startlingly clear pictures of the shuttle's delicate protective tiles to see whether they had sustained the kind of liftoff damage that would make it unsafe to come home.",

      "abstract": "Floyd Norris column says that when Christpher Cox is confirmed as chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission and is asked by public companies to ease Sarbanes-Oxley rules designed to ensure that their internal controls are adequate, he should recall his role as lawyer who in 1985 urged California regulators to spare a client, William Edward Cooper, the expense of seeking appraisals of mortgages in one of his proposed funds; says that if appraisal had been conducted, a fraud that had begun in 1982 might not have continued until 1994, costing investors $100 million; photo (M)",
      "lead_paragraph": "THE lawyer solemnly told regulators it would be far too costly for a mutual fund to seek appraisals of its assets, and no appraisals were made. When employees of the investment firm suspected something was amiss, they were reassured when a government auditor pored over the books and concluded that all was well.",
