      "abstract": "Two senior prosecutors in 2004 war crimes trials against four detainees at Guantanamo Bay complained in confidential messages that trial system was secretly arranged to improve chance of conviction and to deprive defendants of material that could prove their innocence; their complaints echoed those made by military defense lawyers and outside groups like American Bar Assn; one prosecutor, Capt John Carr, claimed in e-mail message that Col Frederick L Borch, chief prosecutor, told subordinates that members of military commission that would try first four defendants would be 'handpicked' to ensure that all would be convicted; Borch has called this and other complaints about him 'monstrous lies'; Carr also said he was told that any exculpatory evidence would be withheld by CIA for security reasons, including evidence that at least one of four defendants had been brutalized; second prosecutor, Maj Robert Preston, said in message to another senior officer that he knew proceedings would not be 'full and fair'; Defense Dept says its formal investigation found no evidence to support two officers' accusations of legal or ethical problems; Preston and Carr left prosecution team weeks after sending their e-mail messages; trials, of Salim Ahmed Hamdan and David Hicks, were halted in Nov when federal judge ruled they violated military law and Geneva Conventions; that ruling was reversed in July and trials are expected to resume shortly; photo (L)",

      "abstract": "NASA debates whether two errant strips of heavy insulating cloth protruding by one inch from space shuttle Discovery may cause hazardous overheating as shuttle returns to Earth; if so, agency may order first spacewalk to underside of orbiter to correct problem; mission's lead flight director Paul Hill says evaluation of problem has provoked 'strong disagreement' among NASA analysts, with some engineers very concerned about situation and others who are not; this is latest problem in return-to-flight mission that is seeing its share of success and disappointment; photos (M)",

      "abstract": "Iraqi leaders, under intense American presssure, agree to finish writing country's constitution by mid-August, raising possibility that fiercest disagreements over future of Iraqi state will be left unresolved; Iraqis had sought six-month extension of deadline in order to help bridge vast differences that still divide Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds; among most divisive issues are rights of women, role of Islam and scope and reach of Kurdish self-rule; American officials argue that extending deadline would probably prolong constitutional stalemate rather than resolve it, and that more contentious issues could best be dealt with by elected legislature; keeping political process on track is central to Bush administration's desire to begin drawing down number of American troops by early spring; photo (M)",

      "abstract": "Prosecutors' pursuit of reporters from Time and New York Times in their investigation of who leaked identity of CIA officer moves news organizations to seek new ways to protect reporters and sources in what they believe to be increasingly antagonistic environment; news executives are issuing guidelines to educate and retrain their staffs about taking better precautions; are looking at technological fixes like heightened encryption and e-mail messages that expire after a period of time, as well as old techniques like using pay phones to communicate with sources or meeting them in person; Times is looking into ways of bundling office telephone extensions so that calls to and from particular reporters cannot be identified; Jane Kirtley, who teaches media ethics and law at University of Minnesota, says such efforts pose danger that motivation for editors will become protecting themselves from legal assault as opposed to producing quality journalism (M)",
