With factory orders plummeting and goods piling up in company warehouses, the institute said big job cuts were sure to follow.     It was a pretty gutsy move at the time. Alan Greenspan, then the Federal Reserve chairman, and just about every major Wall Street firm were saying in early 2001 that the Fed's aggressive interest rate cuts would lift consumer spending and prevent a recession. In truth, one had already begun.  ",

The talk of the court this summer, with the arrival of the new crop of law clerks, is that the number of female clerks has fallen even more sharply.     Just under 50 percent of new law school graduates in 2005 were women. Yet women account for only 7 of the 37 law clerkships for the new term, the first time the number has been in the single digits since 1994, when there were 4,000 fewer women among the country's new law school graduates than there are today.

The much-anticipated minutes of the Aug. 8 meeting, released yesterday, showed that the policy makers were hoping that a slowing economy, a deteriorating housing market and the accumulating impact of previous rate increases had mitigated the need for still higher interest rates to control inflation.
