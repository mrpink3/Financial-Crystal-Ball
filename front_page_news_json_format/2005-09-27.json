      "abstract": "WellPoint, the giant health insurer, is near a deal to acquire WellChoice, the largest health insurer in New York State and the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, for about $6.5 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to the negotiations.      A deal, if completed, would give WellPoint, already the nation's largest health insurer with 28 million members, an expanded foothold in the Northeast. More important, a deal in New York would put it in direct competition with Oxford Health Plans in New York, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint's acquisitive rival.  ",

      "abstract": "Before the Iraq war, one of the Pentagon's biggest concerns was that American troops would face unknown biological and chemical threats. But when the order came in to step up production of two-piece protective suits, the Pentagon had to look overseas to get all the parts -- even to countries that opposed the war.     The polyester fabric used by American companies to make the suits came from Germany and Austria. Finnish and British manufacturers made the eyelets and washers, while Japan provided the carbon beads in the suit's liner. Critical to the suit's protection was a fabric available only in Germany, one of the war's strongest critics.  ",

      "abstract": "With fears mounting that high energy costs will crimp economic growth, President Bush called on Americans yesterday to conserve gasoline by driving less. He also issued a directive for all federal agencies to cut their own energy use and to encourage employees to use public transportation.     ''We can all pitch in,'' Mr. Bush said. ''People just need to recognize that the storms have caused disruption,'' he added, and that if Americans are able to avoid going ''on a trip that's not essential, that would be helpful.''  ",
