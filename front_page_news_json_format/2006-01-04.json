      "abstract": "Two months ago, a little-known investor demanded that the publisher of The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer be put up for sale. Just 14 days later, after several other investors also emerged with the same demand, the board of the publisher, Knight Ridder, gave in and put the company on the block.     Unlike the 1980's, when such challenges might be resisted at all costs, today corporate boards are adjusting to a new reality: the activist investor, armed with a handful of shares and a megaphone, is changing corporate America and the deal-making landscape.

      "abstract": "The BASF Group of Germany, the world's largest chemical maker, made a hostile takeover bid of $4.9 billion yesterday for Engelhard, an American company that invented the catalytic converter for cars.     BASF first approached Englehard, which is based in Iselin, N.J., with an offer in December but was rebuffed. Engelhard, which specializes in manufacturing clean-air technology, yesterday urged that shareholders ''take no action at this time'' on the offer, which would represent almost a 23 percent premium over Engelhard's year-end closing price.

Earlier Tuesday evening, the body of one miner was found 11,200 feet from the mine entrance, within a few hundred feet of a vehicle used to transport the workers deep into the mine, company officials said.

The inquiry could involve as many as a dozen lawmakers, people involved in the case said.     Mr. Abramoff, 46, once a prominent Republican lobbyist, accepted a recommended reduced prison sentence of about 10 years in exchange for testifying against former associates in the influence-peddling case. The agreement also requires Mr. Abramoff to pay more than $26 million in tax penalties and restitution to former clients, although he has told associates he is broke.  ",

      "abstract": "When the cable network Oxygen made its debut in February 2000, two and a half hours of programming each day was devoted to ''Pure Oxygen,'' a magazine-style talk show about ''all things female.''     Since then, it has gradually replaced its wholesome tone with fare like ''Talk Sex With Sue Johanson,'' a call-in sex advice show that is on Fridays at 2 a.m. Now, Oxygen is making another move to overhaul its lingering earnest image. On Sunday, the network will introduce ''Campus Ladies,'' a ribald comedy about two middle-age suburban women who go back to college and indulge in some age-inappropriate partying and carousing with male undergraduates.

But when he cut a deal with federal prosecutors on Tuesday, he shook up this town as never before.     Not long ago, Mr. Abramoff was perhaps Washington's most aggressive -- and, at $750 an hour, most highly compensated -- deal maker, a flamboyant man who moved fluidly through the nexus of money and power. Now his decision to cooperate in a broadening corruption and bribery investigation has thrust him into the role of a corporate insider turning against the company that claimed just to be doing business as usual.
