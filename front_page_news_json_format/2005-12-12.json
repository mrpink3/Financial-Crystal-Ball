Once you've been down the high-def path, you don't want to go back.     Which is also why I've been so perplexed by all the hoopla surrounding the Disney-Apple deal announced a few months ago. In case you've been living in a media-deprived cave, Disney, owner of the ABC television network, agreed to allow people to download weekly episodes of two of its most popular shows, ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' onto an iPod, a wonderful device for music, but one whose tiny screen forces you to squint to see video images. It's not free, either. Just as Apple charges 99 cents to download a song, it is charging $1.99 for each episode of the shows.  ",
