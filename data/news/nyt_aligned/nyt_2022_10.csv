2022-10-03,A Classic Novel of the Nazis’ Rise That Holds Lessons for Today,"There is a famous saying in Talmud, attributed to the sage Tarfon: “It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you free to neglect it.” For Tarfon, “the work” was the study of Torah — that is, the unfinishable task of trying to understand God’s word. But with the gradual and tenuous emancipations of European Jewry throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Tarfon’s injunction to study became assimilated too, as Jews were admitted to secular schools and exchanged the traditional texts for the sciences. In effect, the task stayed the same, while “the work” itself changed, from the study of God’s word to the study of (for example) medicine and law. For German Jews in particular, “the work” came to stand for the free transmission of knowledge, the assertion of moral absolutes and ethical standards, and the preservation of the Enlightenment-era democratic rationality that had finally liberated them from the ghettos in the revolutions of 1848, and that would keep them out of the ghettos for just under a century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/books/review/lion-feuchtwanger-oppermanns.html

There’s also a savory pie of the day, a throwback to Mr. Szymanski’s well-received stint at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, introduced here with a filling of chicken, pig’s trotter and leeks. The menu features offal, with black pudding alongside clams, a pig’s head terrine with piccalilli, and braised tripe with cipollini onions and Madeira. Mr. Szymanski and Ms. Howard do not deny the influence of the chef Fergus Henderson, the British master of nose-to-tail. The brick-walled, 60-seat dining room is fitted with a stretch of marble bar, walnut furnishings, booths and hunter green drapery accents, including around a semi-secluded enclave.

From Philadelphia — where she was born and as a child took art classes at the Philadelphia Art Museum — she traveled to New York and then, after winning a Whitney fellowship to study at the American Academy, to Rome, where she still casts the large-scale bronze sculptures for which she is best known. In the late 1950s, she briefly returned to the States to study design and architecture — under Josef Albers, Alvin Eisenman, Philip Johnson, Louis Kahn and Vincent Scully — at the Yale School of Art, becoming the first known woman of color to earn her M.F.A. from the university. And in the following decades, which Chase-Riboud, now 83, has spent mostly in Paris — where she lives in an Art Deco apartment in the Sixth Arrondissement — she has established herself as one of the most prolific and boundary-breaking artists of her generation, making work defined by both its technical prowess and its searing meditations on American history.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/t-magazine/barbara-chase-riboud.html

2022-10-05,What Does Sustainable Living Look Like? Maybe Like Uruguay,"Let’s say you live in the typical American household. It doesn’t exist, not in any sense except in a data set, but it’s easy enough to imagine. Maybe it’s your aunt’s, or your neighbor’s, or a bit like your own. Since more than half of us live outside big cities, it’s probably in a middle-class suburb, like Fox Lake, north of Chicago. You picked it because it’s affordable and not a terrible commute to your job. Your house is about 2,200 square feet — a split-level ranch, perhaps. You’re in your mid-30s and just welcomed your first child. Together with your partner you make about $70,000 a year, some of which goes toward the 11,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 37,000 cubic feet of natural gas you use to heat the house, play video games and dry your clothes. You take six or seven plane flights a year, to visit your mom after her surgery or attend a conference, and drive about 25,000 miles, most of which you barely register anymore, as you listen to Joe Rogan or Bad Bunny. Maybe twice a month you stop at Target and pick up six or seven things: double-sided tape, an extra toothbrush, an inflatable mattress.

I wrote to ask what the charges pertained to and received a response that seemed to imply (although it did not categorically state) that the charges were fees related to traffic tickets issued to me while I had the car. Yet I received no traffic tickets. When I asked Europcar for details, I was told they couldn’t tell me because of privacy regulations. I found that highly doubtful — and somewhat akin to going to a doctor who claimed she couldn’t tell me my diagnosis for privacy reasons!

2022-10-06,Poem: During an Enchantment in the Life,"Love poems are difficult to write and to read because they can be clichéd. This poem surrounds the topic of love versus sinking in it. In the title, love is “an enchantment,” not “my enchantment,” removing intimacy. Love is also expressed as something that lives “in the life” — it isn’t the whole life. The poem is written in second-person point of view, circumventing the potential sentimentality of the first person. The ending subverts some of the movements above, and the unifying principle of love is severed to a “they” and a “you,” with jarring new punctuation. Here, all the asynchronicities of love appear.

So while I cherish my memories of reading “The Waste Land” on city buses and park benches in 1990s San Francisco, I knew even while I was reading it that the main thing I would come away with was a feel for its rhythm and mood while galloping right over the context of Eliot’s life and times that might have cracked it wider open for me.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

You might also note how the opposite corners of the page can now touch. More folds mean more connections, more speed, more power — a good metaphor for poems. Verse (from the Latin for “turn,” as in turn of the plow) creates more folds. Lines call attention to the surface area of language, the words that brush against one another as they file into their pews, not just the words next to them but above and below them too.

Initially, the episodes appear to be light five-minute affairs about the small dramas of toddler penguinhood: Pingu spits his veggies into the toilet; a municipal penguin employee turns Pingu’s play area into a parking spot. But with a balance of farce and sentiment, the show also gestures toward some of early life’s more complicated realities — sibling rivalries, parental punishment and the loneliness of childhood. Created by the German animator Otmar Gutmann, “Pingu” premiered in Europe in the early 1990s and became a worldwide phenomenon; but unlike other global cultural crazes, the show did not need to be dubbed or subtitled. Nothing could be lost in translation because there was nothing to translate. Every “Pingu” character speaks the language of Penguinese, which sounds like Thai, Indonesian, Italian, something in between or something else entirely. Yet, despite the lingo’s seeming inscrutability, it is mysteriously — hilariously — comprehensible.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/magazine/pingu-language.html

Nellie Gardner has just moved back to her ancestral hometown in rural Baxter County with her 11-year-old son, Max, and not much else — they left everything behind in South Carolina to flee her abusive husband. She’s come to claim her inheritance: a house and a thousand acres of pine forest called Redfern Hill, which has been left to her by her grandfather August Redfern. The land became his 70 years earlier, through a dowry from his father-in-law, George Baxter, a carpetbagger who bought it for 10 cents an acre during Reconstruction. For all its past profitability, now the trees have “gory black cavities up and down their trunks where, too many times, the bark was hacked and rehacked to extract the resin and the pines, over too many years, were tricked and tricked again into healing themselves.” From the beginning of this powerful gothic ghost story, it’s clear the real legacy Nellie is inheriting is one of intergenerational greed, and danger.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/books/review/andy-davidson-the-hollow-kind.html

When it happens twice, when it happens three times, you think, why am I looking away?” Blanchett saw in this gesture a “not wanting to be captured” and a shade of the self-protectiveness she had to overcome as a young actor. “You have to allow yourself to be seen, and some people have the gift of being comfortable with that really early on.

One is that it was produced by Aurum — a company controlled by one of Vladimir Putin’s allies, Evgeny Prigozhin — in part to glorify the actions of the Wagner Group, a mercenary network Prigozhin founded; the syndicate has been accused of fueling chaos from Syria to the Central African Republic to Ukraine, where Wagner mercenaries have become an increasingly significant part of Russia’s grinding invasion. Another is that “Granit” was just one artifact in a whole trove of content — memoirs, comic books, travel videos — that is variously referred to as the Wagner subculture, the Wagnerverse or the Wagner Extended Universe. Not unlike old American mercenary magazines, all of it puts a righteous and alluring face on going off to kill and die in unofficial operations aligned with Kremlin interests.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/magazine/russian-action-movies.html

The poet leads you, room by room, through the various chambers of his or her world. Different poets, of course, are very different hosts. T.S.

How exactly this would be measured was unclear.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel costs, notably re-accelerated, running at 6.6 percent. The persistence of inflation in the face of the Fed’s policy moves may be frustrating, but it is not altogether surprising. Most economists expected the process of wrestling down rising prices and cooling off the economy to be slow — though it is starting to seem that even small signs of progress are not cropping up where they should. And now some worry that as inflation becomes more entrenched it could lead to a wage-price spiral, a no-win feedback loop in which rising prices lead to wage increases that then reinforce inflation.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/16/business/the-week-in-business-inflation.html

Employees furiously pack ornate boxes containing laddoos enriched with ghee, spongy rasgula and all manner of colorful sweets, often made with dairy, sugar and nuts and sometimes topped with a layer of edible silver foil.

2022-10-19,Are We Missing Out When Athletes Retire on Top?,"A hero’s journey, ending in a wrenching farewell — sports historians will debate whether Roger Federer was the greatest men’s tennis player of all time, but few will deny that he was among its most dignified. Last month, the 41-year-old, 20-time major champion made official what had felt inevitable for some time: The ravages of age, culminating with a recent knee surgery, finally persuaded him to retire. A hastily arranged final appearance at the Laver Cup in London quickly morphed into a send-off for the Swiss superstar, a Festival of Fed. He teamed up with his friendly rival Rafael Nadal for a doubles match, a contest that felt mostly like an excuse to watch a legend take the court one last time. The raucous aftermath included an emotional on-court interview with a fellow great, Jim Courier. Federer’s current peers were there, all reverential, as was a teeming audience, eager to see him off.

Cheyne gave it the name of the two-faced Roman god who looks forward and back at the same time. “Fast” is a convenient example: People run fast, but they can also stand fast, i.e., stay in place. Probably the most famous Janus word is “cleave,” which means both to chop in two and to bind. “Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers,” the King James has it, but then, in another place, “the clods cleave fast together.” Beware, though: The two meanings descend from separate Old English verbs, clíofan and clífan. You are using a different word when you say “cleave” to mean “split” than when you use it to mean “fuse.” Janusness is slippery this way.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/books/review/cormac-mccarthy-passenger.html

2022-10-20,Poem: The Son I’ll Never Have,"This poem adroitly explores complex emotions around the speaker’s decision not to have a child. Nearly every line is interrupted with a caesura (a period, em dash, comma or question mark), mirroring a zigzagging mind. The poem rhetorically and emotionally zigzags, too, between statements and questions. The title is repeated in the first line with an anaphora of “The son I’ll never have,” adding immediate gravity to the poem. The imagined child is “crossing the lawn,” and the reader is brought imagistically into a momentary sense of loss. But the speaker doesn’t “dare describe” the boy’s knees — there’s only so far the speaker is willing to go emotionally. This poem, though, complicates itself further when the speaker laments the child’s sloppy eating and the challenges of parenting. The second occasion of anaphora occurs with the set of questions beginning, “What is it to ... ,” and the resolved response of “I’ll never know.” The poem’s ending is more surreal as the imaginary boy’s pet rabbit reappears. The last line elevates the poem with its haunting strangeness — the rabbit isn’t real with its “cloudy fur” and can be stroked only in the imagination.

2022-10-20,Ken Burns Wishes More People Would Call Willa Cather a Great American Novelist,"I am. Not as much as I want to be for leisure, because I am constantly reading during the day — my days are 12 and 15 hours long, and therefore by the time I can just sit down and read for pleasure, it’s sort of catch as catch can. But I love the reading I do for my work. People think that film is in some ways the enemy of the word. And it’s not, in our case. We don’t believe in that dialectic whatsoever. In the beginning is the word. And our films reflect that. They are written. They’ve been enormous collaborations that I’ve had with Geoffrey C. Ward and Dayton Duncan over the years, and with my oldest daughter, Sarah Burns, and her husband, David McMahon, who have written the scripts for the films. They’re long ongoing processes. Unlike many cinematic circumstances, the first drafts for these do not come down from Mount Sinai written in stone. They are something that you never stop working on. And our most recent film, “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” written by Geoffrey C. Ward, is a case in point where even after we’d locked the film — which is the semi-technical term in filmmaking for promising your sound editors you won’t touch it anymore — we unlocked it a million times to remove an adjective or to add a qualifying “perhaps” or “some believe,” or whatever it might be, just to be more faithful to the intensely rigorous scholarship we try to attend to with every film.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/books/review/ken-burns-by-the-book-interview.html

2022-10-20,9 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Readers are like eaters: Some days we want to tie on a bib and tuck into a messy seven-course novel, other days we’re more in the mood for the amuse bouche of a sweet and spicy short story or two. This week we have both kinds of brain food on the menu. If you’re craving a chewy novel, R.F. Kuang’s “Babel” is a 500-plus-page feast of ideas and speculative adventure, while Jonathan Coe’s “Mr. Wilder and Me” imagines the slow fade of a famous film director’s career and Andrew Sean Greer sends his comic protagonist Arthur Less on a picaresque tour of America. If it’s an amuse bouche you’re looking for, George Saunders is one of the most reliably amusing storytellers there is; his new collection, “Liberation Day,” takes a darker turn than some of his work has, but it remains characteristically funny and pensive and knowing. Also on the short story front, new collections from the masterly David Means and the celebrated comics writer Alan Moore, along with a novel in stories by Omolola Ijeoma Ogunyemi. In nonfiction, we recommend Maggie Haberman’s New York-centric biography of Donald Trump and Amy Liptrot’s “The Instant,” a meditative memoir (or memoiristic meditation?) about Berlin and the digital age.

After a decades-long estrangement from her family, Johanna, an accomplished middle-aged painter, returns from the United States to Oslo, where a retrospective of her work is to be exhibited in a prominent museum. Her mother and sister still reside in the city, and as Johanna reacquaints herself with it, she fixates on the old women she encounters: “Hunched up,” struggling up stairways, shuffling in the street, digging inside old handbags, they “turn away from the world.” In these figures she sees her mother, or a woman who could be her mother — Johanna’s estrangement is such that she has forgotten, or doesn’t know, simple facts about her mother: her birthday, when her hair turned gray, if she has ever broken her hip. Would anyone even tell her if her mother had died?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/books/review/is-mother-dead-vigdis-hjorth.html

2022-10-25,Help! The Hotel I Booked Online Became a Homeless Shelter and No One Told Me.,"Last month, I was to attend a friend’s Saturday wedding in Manhattan and then catch up with my husband at his family reunion on Sunday in Atlanta. So I booked a room at the Queens County Inn and Suites in Long Island City via Booking.com, not far from LaGuardia, where I would catch a 6 a.m. flight Sunday morning. But when I arrived at the hotel around 11:30 p.m., I found it had been converted into a homeless shelter. Alone and nearly five months pregnant, I felt very unsafe in the neighborhood and finally got an Uber so that I could wait at the airport as I contacted Booking.com. The representative did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation, and told me she needed to email the hotel and give them 30 minutes to respond before she could help. Over an hour later, the representative, who told me no supervisors were available, said I would receive an email with new lodging arrangements. I never did (and the hotels I tried were all booked because of the U.S. Open tennis tournament). Meanwhile, LaGuardia was closed, so I waited outside — in a wheelchair a kind maintenance worker provided — until the doors opened at 4 a.m. The hotel didn’t charge me, so money is not an issue. But I’d like Booking to take another look at their customer service and safety procedures. Can you help? Anna, Atlanta",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/travel/tripped-up-hotel-booking.html
2022-10-25,31 New Yorkers You Should Know About but Don’t,"923,380,602. Nearly a billion. That’s a guesstimate of how many people have lived in New York City since its first official census in 1790, according to a demographer whom Sam Roberts consulted while writing his new book, “The New Yorkers: 31 Remarkable People, 400 Years, and the Untold Biography of the World’s Greatest City.” Roberts cites this number to underscore the sheer dynamism and scale of “the World’s Greatest City” (never mind that New York — as defined by its five boroughs — hasn’t ranked among the world’s most populous cities for decades). It also lends context to the necessarily subjective nature of his project: to narrate the city’s larger social history, across the four centuries since its founding, through the lives of fewer than three dozen of its residents.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/books/review/the-new-yorkers-sam-roberts.html

Novels, especially historical novels, often owe debts like this — to a photo or a scrap of prose, a song or a film.

He moved to California from Peru in 2016 and worked at several Michelin-starred restaurants in Silicon Valley. Now, with several partners, he’s poised to showcase the cuisine of Peru, most notably the region where he’s from, with its abundant seafood and a cuisine that represents Spanish, African, Indigenous and Chinese influences. Some Andean and Amazonian ingredients, like sachatomate and culantro, make their way into his food, and potatoes, native to Peru, figure in often-complex preparations like a “thousand-layer” gratin, a foam to sauce 24-hour short ribs, and a layered causa with steak tartare. There are ceviches, like one with octopus, fried calamari and chulpi (corn nuts). Octopus is served with beans and aji amarillo; and fish comes with plantains, yucca and Amazonia curry. The Chinese influence comes in with pork belly, char siu and snow peas. There’s a seven-course tasting menu ($140) in addition to an à la carte menu. All of this is presented in a setting that combines a bar area and dining room seating 46 with an open kitchen. There’s a private dining room on the lower level. Stone presentation plates are hand-carved, and Peruvian artifacts are on display in a room filled with greenery. The drinks are a showcase for pisco. A $60 lineup of three pisco mixtures is offered at the tables and at the bar, which is run by Marek Trocha and Roman Cervantes and Atif Ali, who are consultant-partners. David Cabrera is a third partner on the financial side. (Opens Wednesday) ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

The stanza and line breaks in the penultimate line, along with the extension of the typical 14-line sonnet, reveal Corral’s skill in regulating a poem’s (and a reader’s) feelings.

But the director Lee Yong-ju is more interested in a philosophical inquiry, and his slow-burning film casts a genuinely affecting spell. The former intelligence operative Ki-heon (Gong Yoo, from “Train to Busan”) is hired to look after Seobok (Park Bo-gum), a genetically engineered clone who is so objectified that he is referred to as “the specimen.” Because he could potentially live forever, Seobok forces us to consider what it means to be human: isn’t our awareness of our mortality a big part of it? At first, he seems to have the innocence of a newborn, but we progressively realize that Seobok has a degree of self-consciousness, and is aware of what his existence might mean for others. “I keep on thinking about my fate,” the clone says when asked what he does all day. Because various factions are interested in Seobok, he and Ki-heon find themselves on the run, and the movie becomes increasingly poignant.

The swift cuts suggest that Mr. Musk is going to move quickly to carry out his vision — and by taking Twitter private, the mercurial billionaire is not beholden to shareholders or required to make regular public disclosures as he does so. What he is planning to do remains somewhat hazy, but Mr. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and said he would reverse the ban on former President Donald J.
