Chicago’s farm system is stocked and Joe Maddon, the Tampa Bay Rays manager, is signed ahead of the 2015 season. Add youngsters like Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber, and free agents like Jon Lester, and a long-losing club is finally No. 1.

It occupies a good chunk of the sweeping, mostly unfinished 23,000-square-foot space whose windows overlook Norman Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and it’s finally opening after a two-month delay. Seating for 140 surrounds a long L-shaped white counter and open kitchen where the chef Andrew Whitcomb, who is from Maine, produces food for self-service breakfasts and lunches — and, by the end of the month, for more formal dinners. “The idea is to feed people who come here to work — there’s no membership required — and become a destination, we hope, in the evening,” Mr. Meyer said. A slow-roasted pork sandwich, a wild rice grain bowl and a maitake mushroom tart are some lunch items. Dinner will feature brined vegetables, scallop crudo, roasted red cabbage, and pork collar with sprouted spelt and endives. Bowls of steel-cut oats are served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Scandinavian touches frequently show up. “I love using grains and vegetables, and understand the Scandinavian approach,” Mr. Whitcomb said. “It’s not a fad, it’s about the products and flavors”: 29 Norman Avenue (Banker Street), Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 347-966-2092, restaurantnorman.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/norman-restaurant-greenpoint-claus-meyer-fredrik-berselius.html

The French media omitted the details, but an Interior Ministry official soon called with confirmation: Kepel’s name was near the top of the list.

But when misdirected, anger can harm our physical health and our relationships. Being mindful of anger means not suppressing, denying or avoiding it and also not acting out in harmful ways. Instead, connect with the direct experience of the anger, and then decide what action you want to take.” — Jessica Morey, executive director of Inward Bound Mindfulness Education",Well,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/well/mind/how-to-be-mindful-when-you-are-angry.html

During play dates, Lily often liked to play orphan, writing down long lists of chores: dichs (dishes); moping (mopping); feeding (the fish). She and a friend liked to drink something they called pepper water, which was ordinary tap water they pretended their cruel orphan-handlers had made undrinkable. Maybe it was thrilling to stage her own mistreatment, to take power over the situation of powerlessness she had imagined. Maybe she just liked a virtuous reason to dump water on the floor. When I asked Lily why Cinderella’s stepmother was her favorite character, she leaned close to me and whispered, like a secret, “I think she looks good.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/magazine/in-the-shadow-of-a-fairy-tale.html

An unalloyed charmer, the movie tells a story of familiar British grit and resolve during World War II from an attractively different angle: that of an advertising copywriter, Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), who’s recruited by the government to join the film industry. Britain wants the United States to enter the war, and has decided cinematic propaganda is the way it can persuade the movie-mad Yanks to sign up. The world is facing a historic catastrophe, after all; but for this ambitious young woman it’s also a bittersweet opportunity.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/movies/their-finest-review.html

By that point, Mitsuha (a girl yearning to leave her small town) and Taki (a boy in Tokyo) have come to know each other as well as two people can. For reasons they don’t understand, each’s consciousness has been temporarily jumping into the other’s physical shell, only to jump back. This happens at night, which means that Mitsuha regularly wakes up in Taki’s body, and he wakes up in hers, a swap that he likes to confirm by fondling his (her) breasts.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/movies/your-name-review.html

There’s also an early contender for novel of the 22nd century, “American War,” which imagines a post-apocalyptic United States devastated by a second civil war.

It was a version of this narrative, market-tested on Breitbart News, that carried Mr. Trump to the presidency. One way to understand Trumpism is as applied Bannonism. The first few months of President Trump’s term have been an attempt to put all of that theory into practice, and by any reasonable standard, that attempt has failed.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/steve-bannon-isnt-a-genius.html

2017-04-07,One Photographer Spent 25 Years Documenting Wealth,"Lauren Greenfield (who may be most well known for her 2012 documentary “The Queen of Versailles”) has been documenting American wealth since 1992, when she began taking pictures of students at her old high school in Santa Monica. “Despite the dramatic divisions in the city revealed by the L.A. riots ... rich kids and poor kids had found common ground that their parents had not, and it was a shared love for Versace,” she writes in “Generation Wealth,” her new book. With a golden cover and 650-odd images inside, the volume is a sociological record of the extreme measures taken to acquire and spend money, what Greenfield calls “the influence of affluence.” One shot shows Tupac at the craps table in Vegas, another, a Chinese billionaire’s replica of the White House. Some of the photographs will go on view this weekend in a show of Greenfield’s work at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, and are set to land in New York this fall, around the release of her next documentary. All of this output suggests a longstanding clarity of purpose, but Greenfield says it wasn’t until the financial crisis of 2008 (which she calls “a morality tale”) that she realized the underlying theme uniting her work. “It’s not about Birkin bags or the Kardashians,” she says. “It’s about the culture that gave rise to them.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/t-magazine/art/lauren-greenfield-photography-generation-wealth.html

The metaphors we use to talk about brains and minds struck Daugman as especially susceptible. The technology that Greeks and Romans developed for pumping water, for instance, underpinned their theories of the four humors and the pneumatic soul. Later, during the Enlightenment, clockwork mechanisms left their imprint on materialist arguments that man was only a sophisticated machine. And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: “Today’s embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon,” he wrote. “There is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/magazine/new-technology-is-built-on-a-stack-is-that-the-best-way-to-understand-everything-else-too.html

Viewed alongside each other, the works reveal a striking coherence of form. Take Bourgeois’s “Echo I,” a sweatshirt turned inside out, stretched vertically from sleeve to sleeve and cast in bronze, next to a drapey Kawakubo knit wool dress with elongated sleeves bundled at the wrists. The works also share a preoccupation with psychology and the passing of time. For Bourgeois, clothes were tokens of the past, a place she often returned to; accompanying the installation will be a recording of Bourgeois, in her 90s, singing songs from her girlhood. Meanwhile, Dennis Freedman, the former Barneys creative director who conceived of the project, talks of the profundity of watching the Comme des Garçons fall 2015 show: “They narrowed the runway so the models had to turn and face each other before going their separate ways,” he says. “One fashion writer quoted Dickens, saying ‘Life is made of ever so many partings welded together.’” — KATE GUADAGNINO",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/t-magazine/rei-kawakubo-louise-bourgeois-salon-94-salad-for-president.html

My Balls!” Though the film finished shooting in 2004, the studio mothballed it for more than a year. When “Idiocracy” was finally released, it wasn’t screened for critics or promoted in any other way — there wasn’t even a trailer — and it was shown in only seven cities, New York not among them.

(A triple-double means registering, in one game, double digits in three different statistics, usually points, rebounds and assists.) This had happened only once in N.B.A. history, in 1962, and it seemed unlikely to ever happen again. “Averaging a triple-double,” I wrote, “is like having a helicopter that is also a boat that can also write the Great American Novel”; if Westbrook managed to pull it off, it “would be not only historic and impressive but also a little weird, almost disturbing.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/magazine/the-unreasonable-genius-of-russell-westbrook.html

When Season 2 ended, the Garveys’ adopted hometown, Jarden, Tex., had fallen into chaos, infiltrated by the doomsday cult Guilty Remnant and by armies of disgruntled nomads who had been gathering size for months outside the community’s gates. But when the Season 3 premiere begins (after two prologues I’ll address in a bit), everyone is settled into a congenial daily routine, three years after the events of last year’s finale. At a surprise party for his stepson, Tommy, Kevin has a relaxed evening of laughs, hugs and fellowship, during which he tells a sweet story about meeting Tommy’s mother, Laurie, when they were both involved in a car wreck. He muses on the whims of fate and the beauty of the universe, and on how so much of life is about being in the right place at the right time.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/arts/television/the-leftovers-season-3-premiere-the-book-of-kevin-recap.html

It is not a one-time event; the flights take place throughout the year, dispersing a load that amounts to 25,000 tons.

Mr. Conant describes it as ambitious, seasonal new-school Italian, with a menu that will change at least monthly. A smoked eggplant tartlet; truffled pea Caesar salad; short ribs with fava bean salsa verde and horseradish; crab cannelloni with uni; and escolar with black rice, cuttlefish and an oxtail sauce are offered à la carte, or they may be part of a tasting menu. The dining room, done in white with mirrors and crystal chandeliers, is an elegant throwback, tablecloths and all. “I want it to harken back to a more thoughtful approach to dining,” he said.

2017-04-19,South Korea’s Moment of Truth,"The impeachment, ouster and now indictment of South Korea’s president after months of protests, and the presidential race this has spawned, are about as much political drama as any nation could wish for.

They started a medical revolution and an enormous industry, with damaging consequences for her family. The movie based on all this is just about 95 minutes long.

2017-04-19,Our Climate Future Is Actually Our Climate Present,"A few years ago, a locally famous blogger in San Francisco, known as Burrito Justice, created an exquisitely disorienting map, with help from a cartographer named Brian Stokle, and started selling copies of it online. The map imagined the city in the year 2072, after 60 years of rapid sea-level rise totaling 200 feet. At present, San Francisco is a roughly square-shaped, peninsular city. But on the map, it is severed clean from the mainland and shaved into a long, fat smudge. The shape of the land resembles a sea bird diving underwater for prey, with odd bays chewing into the coastlines and, farther out, a sprawl of bulging and wispy islands that used to be hills. If you lived in San Francisco, it was a map of where you already were and, simultaneously, where you worried you might be heading. “The San Francisco Archipelago,” Burrito Justice called it — a formerly coherent city in shards.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/magazine/our-climate-future-is-actually-our-climate-present.html
2017-04-19,How a Warming Planet Drives Human Migration,"Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. This map overlays human turmoil — represented here by United Nations data on nearly 64 million “persons of concern,” whose numbers have tripled since 2005 — with climate turmoil, represented by data from NASA’s Common Sense Climate Index. The correlation is striking. Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden-onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees,” so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents — representing a total of 500 million adults — said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/magazine/how-a-warming-planet-drives-human-migration.html

2017-04-20,How to Stop Drug Price Gouging,"One of Donald Trump’s few universally welcomed campaign promises was to do something about the prices of pharmaceutical drugs. Most Americans recognize that prices are too high, and are bothered by the rise of pharmaceutical price gouging: the giant price increase for decades-old drugs and devices by the likes of Martin Shkreli with Daraprim or Mylan with the EpiPen. But what few people realize is that the president already has the power to do something about drug prices if he really wants to. If Mr. Trump wishes to show he’s serious about his populist promise, the place to start is by declaring war on the price gougers.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/how-to-stop-drug-price-gouging.html

In early August, after nine people died, Dallas County declared a state of emergency: It was caught in an epidemic of what turned out to be West Nile virus, the worst ever experienced by a city in the United States.

At first glance, they would appear to hail from distant planets. Yet once they met in Paris in 1928, they enjoyed an unusually close and mutually beneficial friendship that lasted until Calder’s death in 1976. With other artistic pairs, like Pissarro and Cézanne or Picasso and Braque, competitiveness ignited and acrimony at times soured the creative ferment. But Miró and Calder unfailingly championed and nourished each other’s work. A principle that Calder applied to his art could also describe their relationship: “Disparity in form, color, size, weight, motion, is what makes a composition.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/arts/design/miro-calder-and-a-convergence-of-constellations.html

2017-04-20,How Singapore Is Creating More Land for Itself,"Jurong Island, a man-made smear of sand, lies just off the southern coast of Singapore. A quarter the size of Nantucket, it is thoroughly given over to the petrochemical industry, so crowded with spindly cracking towers and squat oil-storage tanks that the landscape is a blur of brand names — BASF, AkzoNobel, Exxon Mobil, Vopak. One of the island’s most distinctive features, though, remains hidden: the Jurong Rock Caverns, which hold 126 million gallons of crude oil. To get there, you ride an industrial elevator more than 325 feet into the earth, and that brings you to the operations tunnel, a curving space as lofty as a cathedral. It is so long that workers get around on bicycles. Safety goggles mist up with the heat and the humidity; the rock walls, wet from dripping water, look so soft they might have been scooped out of chocolate ice cream. This is as far as anyone — even the workers — can go. The caverns themselves are an additional 100 feet beneath the ocean: two sealed cylindrical vaults, extending away from Jurong. They opened for business in 2014. Next year, three new vaults will be ready. Then, if all goes according to plan, there will be six more.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/how-singapore-is-creating-more-land-for-itself.html

It was literary flotsam, a poem I hadn’t heard of and couldn’t place in time or tradition. Here were the names of Homer — Hector, Helen, Philoctete, Achille — but also Voodoo deities and lines from “Buffalo Soldier,” ghosts of Troy but also camera-wielding tourists and fishermen revving chain saws as they prepared to fell the ancient trees (those last silent “gods” of a pre-Columbian past) on a forested volcanic slope. The stanzas moved to Dante’s terza rima, but the poem began in patois: “This is how, one sunrise, we cut down them canoes.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/books/in-praise-of-derek-walcotts-epic-of-the-americas.html

This was no cynical political crusade; Bradley was a true believer. He liked to declare that athletes were not “roulette chips” and tell the story of a game he once played in Madison Square Garden. His Knicks were up by 5 at the end when the other team hit a meaningless basket to cut the final lead to 3. A confused Bradley heard cheers in the crowd, and when someone told him why — the opponent had just lost by fewer points and beat the spread predicted by oddsmakers — his eyes were opened to the sordid callousness of the gambling world. Bradley helped push through the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992, all but banning sports betting outside Nevada and driving a growing industry that employed hundreds underground.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/magazine/could-legalized-gambling-save-us-from-the-insufferability-of-fantasy-sports.html

There are exposed air ducts and I-beams scribbled with contractors’ marks. Many of the internal walls are unpainted plywood. The space looks less like the headquarters of one of the world’s wealthiest companies and more like a Chipotle with standing desks. It’s an aesthetic meant to reflect — and perhaps also inspire employee allegiance to — one of Facebook’s founding ideologies: that things are never quite finished, that nothing is permanent, that you should always look for a chance to take an ax to your surroundings.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/magazine/can-facebook-fix-its-own-worst-bug.html

When I married — I was 19 and a college junior — the only culinary experience I could claim was burning down my parents’ kitchen seven years earlier, a misadventure involving frozen fries and boiling oil.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/baking-is-all-in-the-hands.html

When the crowd applauded, my 18-month-old daughter, Roxie, clapped excitedly with them. In the show’s final act, an otherwise dignified Canadian father with Justin Trudeau-like good looks thrust his pelvis across the makeshift stage as if possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/travel/family-travel-jamaica-all-inclusive-vacation-franklyn-d-resort-nanny.html
2017-04-26,"Rei Kawakubo, Interpreter of Dreams","Rei Kawakubo is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who has been making monochromatic, boiled, overstuffed, unraveling, surreal clothes since she began her label, Comme des Garçons, in 1969. In the ’80s, an era of triangular fluorescent shoulders and moussed bangs, she sent widow’s weeds trailing down the runway. In the ’90s, her clothes grew tumors that resembled bustles, blurring the lines between illness and beauty, what to look at and what to look away from. While her stores stock simple cotton poplin shirts as well as more challenging lumpen jackets and her runway shows present one-off sculptures, the through-line is a thoughtful rejection of should and a strong feeling of perhaps. The name of her label, which translates to “Like the Boys,” is a quiet, defiant shrug.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/rei-kawakubo-interpreter-of-dreams.html
2017-04-26,The C.E.O. of H.I.V.,"Last May, at the height of the Democratic presidential campaign, two weeks before the California primary, Bernie Sanders flew to San Bernardino, Calif., for a meeting with leading AIDS groups. The gathering was arranged by Peter Staley, the esteemed activist and founder of the Treatment Action Group, which in the 1990s helped speed the development of antiretroviral drugs. The meeting was called to secure the Sanders campaign’s support for a spike in federal spending to combat AIDS, but as the session began, those in attendance were puzzled to find the conversation oddly strained. Sanders’s demeanor, Staley recalled, “was very wary — he was very chilly when we shook hands.” Sanders seemed to be churning internally about something until, dispensing with ceremony, he blurted out: “Let me be blunt.

2017-04-26,The Man to Blame for Our Culture of Fame,"It’s gone now, replaced by a small, unobtrusive park, but in the middle of the 20th century the Stork Club, on East 53rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, was the center of an emerging national culture of celebrity. As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of “a person who is known for his well-knownness.” And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame’s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a mélange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club’s Table 50. In Winchell’s reporting, “The death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,” Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. “Dozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.” Winchell’s reach was enormous. One listener recalled “strolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.’s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/books/review/the-long-view-culture-of-fame-walter-winchell.html

Her 1966 essay “Who Will Revere the Black Woman?” has been reprinted in various collections over the years. But her music lives the fullest afterlife. Lincoln’s tart drawl earned comparisons to Billie Holiday, but she matched it with a deep, bridling intensity that refused to be displaced. The sharp poetry of her lyrics conveyed only a sliver of her message. From Thursday, May 4 to 7, the Apollo Theater will host a festival of conversations and performances titled “Women of the World.” It culminates on Saturday, May 6, with a concert celebrating Lincoln’s work. The musical director, Terri Lyne Carrington, has assembled three world-class vocalists to honor Lincoln: Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Esperanza Spalding.

Ms. Lawler was a part of the so-called “Pictures Generation” of the late 1970s, a group of artists who appropriated images from popular culture to consider the mechanisms of value production. She was in some ways the least noticed of the group because she addressed the emperor’s-clothes aspect of art through the least showy filter: She simply took photographs of objects in museums, auction houses and private collections, and revealed them to be the pricey bric-a-brac that they are. Built into her work was a view of art’s fragility — and a sense of our own, which keeps us attached to it. But what does the market care? It’s never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the season’s brightest stars.

2017-04-28,Elizabeth Warren Really Does Not Like Donald Trump,"HER BACK PAGES: You can tell a lot about a book from its index. Consider Elizabeth Warren’s “This Fight Is Our Fight,” reviewed by Paul Krugman and new to the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1. On its face, the book — subtitled “The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class” — is all about economic issues, and the index is correspondingly flecked with terms like “layoffs” (one citation), “manufacturing decline” (one citation) and “rent assistance” (two citations). But really these are just the parsley on the meatloaf. Flip through the back pages and it’s clear that Warren, the hard-punching Massachusetts senator, has a more personal fight in mind: The index listing for “Trump, Donald” is divided into dozens of subcategories beginning with “bait-and-switch and” (two citations), then moving on to “bigotry and” (four citations), “corporate influences on” (five citations) and “trickle-down and” (seven citations). There are also listings for “tax returns and,” “‘nasty woman’ comment of” and — my favorite — “tweetstorms vs.,” which directs readers to a four-page recap of Warren’s social media battle with Trump during the presidential race. “I tweeted about how he cheated hardworking people who had built his hotels and golf courses,” she recalls. “I mentioned his bullying, his attacks on women, his racism, his obvious narcissism. And in that first tweetstorm, I did my best to sound the alarm: This guy is dangerous, and he could end up as president of the United States.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/books/review/elizabeth-warren-really-does-not-like-donald-trump.html

She enjoyed the social aspect of the work, but especially the quiet moments, when she could daydream “about the books I was reading or conversations I wanted to have or shoes I would like,” she said. “Things I wanted to do, places I wanted to go.” As she made the transition to photographer, writer and website editor, she found herself drawn to the stories playing out behind the windows of the restaurants she passed. The waitresses, especially, caught her attention. When they weren’t reciting the nightly specials or balancing dinner for four on one arm, what were they thinking? The photographs here, taken from either side of the restaurant window, ask this question without trying to answer it.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/album-waitresses-melissa-breyer.html

When I declined to contribute, I received an email from my current supervisor saying my decision made her “sad.” The second time involved colleagues asking me to chip in for a present for my current supervisor after she’d had minor surgery.

2017-04-28,7 Key Themes in Rei Kawakubo’s Career,"In the 1980s, the color black quickly became synonymous with Kawakubo’s aesthetic. When Comme des Garçons made its Paris Fashion Week debut in 1981, the clothes drew attention in their absolute absence of color — an impression that was underlined by interviews with Kawakubo, herself invariably dressed in blacks. Note the plural: Kawakubo used so much, it was possible to see shades and nuances of black in her collections. She wasn’t the first to design in black, of course — Chanel transformed it from a color of mourning into a color of fashion in the 1920s, with her little black dresses, and designers had used it ever since. But by the 1980s, it had fallen out of favor with the rising preference for flashier colors — the brilliant pinks and greens of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler — and the greiges and navies of Giorgio Armani. Black had never been used with Kawakubo’s severity and insistence — she’s used the word “strength” to describe the color. But in 1988, Kawakubo seemed to abruptly change course: She showed a fall collection dominated by rich scarlet. The thought process behind the decision? “Red is black,” she said at the time. Kawakubo’s challenge to color — and perhaps, as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard reasoned, to the idea of women sporting loud hues being transformed into ‘objects’ — is one of the most important fashion statements of the late 20th century. It transformed black into a color of fashion, intellectualism and rebellion — women who wore her clothes were dubbed “the crows.” And when the Harvard School of Design gave Kawakubo an Excellence in Design Award in 2000, they stated that she “invented” black. Maybe not — but she did reinvent it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/t-magazine/fashion/rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons-themes.html
