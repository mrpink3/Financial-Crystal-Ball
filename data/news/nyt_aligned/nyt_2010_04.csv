A lifelong collector of one-of-a-kind bikes from around the world, Maharam, of the New York textile company of the same name, recently made friends with a true expert — Sacha White, a master builder who owns Vanilla Bicycles in Portland, Ore. Together, they conceived an exhibition devoted to the work of craftsmen like White, who make a living cutting steel, welding and filing for weeks on end. (‘‘You wouldn’t want to be their manicurist,’’ Maharam says.) The show, ‘‘Bespoke: The Handbuilt Bicycle,’’ which opens May 12 at the Museum of Arts and Design, collects 21 of the finest contemporary examples from America and abroad, from charming, Old World road bikes to aggressively styled titanium and steel mountain bikes. On the gallery’s back wall, a set of drawings by the design firm 2×4 explains how bicycles are built. Maharam hopes the exhibition will open up the city’s bicycle culture to more people. ‘‘One reason bicycles have become so popular is because manufacturers are making the well designed and beautiful accessible to the masses,’’ he says. ‘‘This is the epitome of the well designed and beautiful.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/bicycles-built-for-you/

Walker, the chief United States district judge of San Francisco, ruled that federal agents had eavesdropped illegally on an Islamic charity based in the United States. Judge Walker said that the Bush administration lacked the authority to act without warrants to intercept phone calls and e-mail messages between Americans and foreigners as part of an effort to prevent terrorist attacks. The ruling delivered a blow to the Bush administration’s claims that its surveillance program, which Mr. Bush authorized shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was lawful. The intercepts, Judge Walker ruled, violated a 1978 federal statute requiring court approval for domestic surveillance. The organization monitored by the taps, in this case, was Al Haramain, a now-defunct Islamic charity in Oregon. Two lawyers representing it in 2004 were also tapped. The judge said the plaintiffs had been “subjected to unlawful surveillance,” and said the government was liable to pay them damages.

Lakshmi Mittal, the chief executive of the steel company ArcelorMittal, is providing about $24 million for the cost of the structure, with the remaining amount coming from the Greater London Authority. Boris Johnson, the city’s mayor, told The Guardian that while some people will say “we are nuts, we are barmy in the depths of a recession to be building Britain’s biggest ever piece of public art,” London’s Olympic Park needed it to spark people’s “curiosity and wonder.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/plan-for-2012-london-olympic-tower-is-unveiled/

Scherrer is building a fashion line to outfit the bereaved that harks back to a time when “a widow’s mourning dress was closely observed,” as in Goya’s painting of the Duchess of Alba. Her line even comes complete with its own fragrance, Maximilia, named after Maximilian Kolbe, the Polish friar who took the place of a condemned man at Auschwitz. Scherrer’s lavish youth is a roman à clef waiting to happen: Catholic school, a caretaker named Guigui, her father’s boutique on the Avenue Montaigne, which, she notes, was once called “L’Allée des Veuves” or “Widows’ Way.” Lately, she’s been dabbling in music, and one of the tracks off her forthcoming album is a cover of Schubert’s “Death and The Maiden.” Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci digs the six-feet-under-obsessed Scherrer, featuring her in a recent ad campaign. “I’m completely in love with her,” he told Women’s Wear Daily. “For me, she represents France in all senses: the elegance, the aristocracy” — and, évidemment — “the darkness.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/leonor-scherrer-deaths-designer/

2010-04-01,A Closer Reading of Roman Vishniac,"In 1983, Farrar,  Straus & Giroux published a book of pictures of prewar Eastern European Jewish life by the photographer Roman Vishniac. Titled “A Vanished World,” the book evoked what many have come to imagine as life in the shtetl: elegiac images of small cities and provincial villages, their hunchback rabbis walking cobblestone streets, Talmud prodigies studying by candlelight, men whispering in courtyards — a vision lighted with authenticity and charged with nostalgia. Through this and other books, Vishniac’s body of work has come to be thought of as the last photographic record of a universe on the cusp of being comprehensively and cataclysmically destroyed. His pictures were used in so many influential books about Jewish life before the Holocaust — as illustrations for books by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Irving Howe and later serving as what Janusz Kaminski called the “guiding force” for his Oscar-winning cinematography of  “Schindler’s List”  — that Vishniac, who died in 1990, has virtually become, in the words of Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, “the official mortuary photographer of Eastern European Jewry.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/magazine/04shtetl-t.html

But the official name of the 377-foot, $29 million red steel structure, right, is the ArcelorMittal Orbit; and when it is finished, it will stand taller than Big Ben or the Statue of Liberty (though it will be several hundred feet shorter than its Parisian ancestor, the Eiffel Tower). Lakshmi Mittal, the chief executive of the steel company ArcelorMittal, is providing about $24 million for the cost of the structure, with the remaining amount coming from the Greater London Authority. Boris Johnson, the city’s mayor, told The Guardian that while some people will say “we are nuts, we are barmy in the depths of a recession to be building Britain’s biggest ever piece of public art,” Olympic Park needed it to spark people’s “curiosity and wonder.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/arts/design/02arts-LONDONOLYMPI_BRF.html

But “Worldfocus,” which had its debut in October 2008, was unable to find enough financing to keep going, despite strong viewer support. A WNET spokeswoman, Kellie Specter, said that Mr. Shapiro, who was not available for comment, still firmly believes in the “Worldfocus” goal to make foreign news less foreign to the audience, but with that show being canceled, “we are still committed to international news and analysis and that’s the reason he brought ‘BBC World News’ back.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/arts/television/02arts-BBCNEWSANDWN_BRF.html

For Helen, a veteran photographer who made her name covering the war, the resounding absence of planes and artillery has transformed Saigon into an eerie place of “nostalgia and history and failure.” Failed dreams and failed ambitions may be the very stuff from which Vietnam narratives are fashioned; but although Helen’s war is over, there is no guarantee she will be on a plane home. As one of her colleagues says ominously, “The war doesn’t ever have to end for us.” For the interpreters of violence there will always be another war zone with new treasures of heartbreaking stories.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Trussoni-t.html

2010-04-02,What’s Left?,"In his 1977 Inaugural Address, Jimmy Carter called the United States “a purely idealistic nation” and expressed the hope that his presidency would be one of “competent and compassionate” government, even as he had to allow for diminished expectations. “We have learned,” he explained, that “even our great nation has its recognized limits.” Nixon, Vietnam and Watergate had exhausted our political spirits. As the 1970s gave way to the 1980s, we waited for the cold war to catch fire, the oil shortage to become utter depletion, the Iran hostage crisis to end in disaster. Potential spies and traitors could be anywhere, but optimism was hard to find. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Cokal-t.html
2010-04-02,The Parent Problem in Young Adult Lit,"It took a surprisingly long time for bad parents to show up in children’s books. Did you ever notice how few there are, compared with, say, the self-centered and murderous parents in Greek mythology or the Bible? In American literature, children’s and adult books didn’t sharply diverge as categories until the 20th century, so it’s not clear whether we should even include that mean, kidnapping drunk, Pap Finn.

In some ultimately perilous way, as we should be warned by the novel’s title, Kevin isn’t very good at thinking about what’s next.

Those who think they know anything about her at all can do little more than recall some nebulous fame as a beautiful, cunning seductress of mighty men in togas. She’s more the stuff of fable for us than a real person who inhabited her own square of time and space. But inhabit one she did, and with a good deal more intelligence, élan and tact than exercised by most of her male allies and enemies in the Roman world.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Simmons-t.html
2010-04-02,Thine Is the Kingdom,"It is only a brief moment, a seemingly inconclusive ­exchange in the midst of one of the most significant interviews in human history. In the Gospel of John, Jesus of Nazareth has been arrested and brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Improbably polite, reflective and reluctant to sentence Jesus to death (the historical Pilate was in fact brutal and quick-tempered), Pilate is portrayed as a patient questioner of this charismatic itinerant preacher. “So you are a king?” Pilate asks, and Jesus says: “You say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is committed to the truth listens to my voice.” Then, in what I imagine to be a cynical, world-weary tone, Pilate replies, “What is truth?” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Meacham-t.html

Eberstadt grew up in a fancifully ornate Upper East Side apartment with pistachio-green velvet walls, ancient statuary and a gold Marilyn by Andy Warhol in the living room, as she reminisced in The New York Observer in 2007. It was a childhood studded with glamour: in 1962 (little Fernanda was just 2 at the time) her parents — the photographer and psychotherapist Fredrick Eberstadt and the novelist Isabel Eberstadt — gave a legendary costume party at which Jacqueline Kennedy, flanked by Secret Service escorts, danced to a reggae band till dawn.

This dichotomy is at the heart of Peter Bognanni’s first novel, “The House of Tomorrow,” which unexpectedly pits the teaching of R. Buckminster Fuller, architect, philosopher and futurist, against the misanthropy of punk. There’s only going to be one winner, but it is a measure of Bognanni’s empathy that his narrator’s decision is never an easy one.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Stace-t.html

Her epigraphs cite musicians (Schoenberg, Schubert); her prose is shot through with recurring leitmotifs and song; and her sensitivity to sound and tempo permeates her new novel.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Kline-t.html
2010-04-02,We Three Kings,"In July 1917 — the point at which Miranda Carter opens this enterprising his­tory of imperial vicissitudes and royal reversals — George V, king of Great Britain and emperor of India, resolved to change his name. In that scorching summer, King George was a worried man. His Russian cousin, Czar Nicholas II, had recently lost his throne and was under house arrest. In Germany, another imperial cousin, Wilhelm II, had been stripped of his proudest title, “supreme warlord.” Deprived of power, Wilhelm discovered a hitherto absent sense of humor. Hearing that the English king had decided to bury his German connections by proclaiming himself a member of the newly formed House of Windsor, the emperor pondered the possibilities for a forthcoming Shakespearean production: “The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Seymour-t.html

2010-04-02,Seized,"About midway through Siri ­Hustvedt’s memoir, she tells the story of a 50-year-old embarrassment: As a young child visiting relatives in Norway, she tried to comfort an older cousin who’d begun weeping, by reaching up and patting her on the back. When the adults laughed, the little girl was “seized by burning humiliation.” This sense of powerlessness in a grown-ups’ world may bring to mind similar incidents for readers of “The Shaking Woman; Or, A History of My Nerves.” Yet Hustvedt, who grew up to become an accomplished novelist and essayist, stresses the moment’s particularity. “I now understand,” she writes, “that the adults’ laughter wasn’t malicious, but the assault on my dignity has lasted, and it shaped my motherhood with my own daughter.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Morrice-t.html
2010-04-02,Dance Dance Revolution,"Most of the lingering images of the disco era aren’t pretty: strobe-lit suburbanites doing the hustle, John Travolta’s white polyester suit and campy preening in “Saturday Night Fever,” mobs pushing and screaming to get into Studio 54. The music itself is easy to snicker at. Set to a clockwork thump, it ordered you to boogie-oogie-oogie or to shake, shake, shake your booty. Disco stormed the charts from 1973 through 1979, but many critics see it as the soundtrack of a vapid decade — a time in which self-indulgence replaced the lofty striving of the ’60s.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Gavin-t.html

The short fiction collected here spans the nearly three decades of McInerney’s career, beginning with early stories like “It’s Six A.M. Do You Know Where You Are?,” which grew into his first novel, “Bright Lights, Big City.” This book, his 10th, reminds us “how impressively broad McInerney’s scope has been,” our reviewer, Sam Tanenhaus, said, adding that McInerney’s prose seems “free of self-consciousness and of mannerism, at once postmodern and naturalistic.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

2010-04-02,Reading Tim O’Brien in Hanoi,"Last month, on a typically dull, gray late-winter Hanoi day, I stopped in at the city’s sole respectable foreign-language bookstore, the Bookworm, for a conversation with a Vietnamese fan of Tim O’Brien. “The Things They Carried,” O’Brien’s celebrated collection of linked stories about the Vietnam War, has just been reissued in a 20th-anniversary edition, and I was interested in gathering a Vietnamese perspective on O’Brien’s work. But it took me days of calls and e-mail messages to find anyone in Hanoi who had read any of it. Finally the manager of the Bookworm suggested I speak with Tran Ngoc Hieu, a lecturer at Hanoi’s Pedagogical University. I needed a while to track him down, as he is perhaps the only person in the city who does not use a mobile phone. Hieu, 30, looks young for his age, and compensates by wearing a sport jacket and speaking a careful, deliberate English with an exceptionally rich vocabulary, interrupting himself frequently to apologize for not speaking English well.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/books/review/Steinglass-t.html
2010-04-02,Georgia: Award in Reverse Discrimination Suit," A jury awarded more than $180,000 in damages Thursday in a reverse discrimination case against DeKalb County and its first black chief executive, Vernon Jones. Three white former managers in the county’s Parks and Recreation Department claimed they were victims of an attempt to replace whites with blacks. A fourth former employee, who is black, claimed he suffered retaliation when he refused to “dig up dirt” on his white colleagues. Mr. Jones, who served from 2001 to 2009, is running for Congress. He denied he had discriminated based on race and compared himself to President Obama. According to trial testimony, the county had 33 black and 61 white top managers when Mr. Jones took office and 60 blacks and 57 whites five years later.

That's an abstract painting, copied from Rothko, and it is indeed very red and very dramatic. But it is Mr. Molina's stare that invests it with real drama."" The show, set in a New York studio on the Bowery in the late 1950s, follows a new assistant as he is initiated into the aesthetic of the artist. "" 'Red,' which arrives as fresh, yes, as paint from its recent premiere at the Donmar Warehouse in London, initially registers as a visceral exercise in art appreciation. Fortunately though, it turns out to be more a study in artist appreciation, a portrait of an angry and brilliant mind that asks you to feel the shape and texture of thoughts.""",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/urbaneye/02ubn1.html

2010-04-02,Houses of Their Dreams,"Even in 3-D, Alice in Wonderland has nothing on the Surrealists, who imagined spaces far trippier than any rabbit hole. Max Ernst drew a maiden trapped inside a giant zoetrope; Alberto Giacometti created rooms strung with a spinal column and other oddities; and Salvador Dalí’s famous ‘‘Dream of Venus’’ installation, at the 1939 World’s Fair, was an aquatic funhouse filled with topless women and a rubber cow udder. For the exhibition ‘‘The Surreal House,’’ which opens June 10 at London’s Barbican gallery, the curators have worked with the architects Carmody Groarke to bring these dreamscapes to life, constructing a labyrinth of rooms and corridors that immerse visitors in the art, films and furnishings of the movement’s original and contemporary practitioners. ‘‘The idea is to radically alter the space so that you’re not sure what’s up, what’s down or where it finishes,’’ says Alona Pardo, an assistant curator at the Barbican. Rather than imagining surreal interiors, the sculptors Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne furnished them. Their zoologically inspired pieces are now on view at the Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris, including hippo-shaped bathtubs and a bed that resembles a can of sardines. The retrospective also includes pieces designed for Yves Saint Laurent’s apartment, exhibited here for the first time.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/houses-of-their-dreams/

These rich supporting materials by Vienna’s early-20th-century masters will be on view at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, alongside their delicate three-dimensional counterparts, beginning April 23 as part of ‘‘Ted Muehling Selects: Lobmeyr Glass From the Permanent Collection.’’ From a baroque, leaf-cut decanter by Ludwig Lobmeyr to the thin, attenuated muslin glass forms that have dominated the past half century, Muehling primarily chose pieces meant for celebration and ritual; the great thing about Lobmeyr, he says, is ‘‘they may be opulent and insanely expensive, but for the most part the pieces are useful and functional drinking glasses.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/master-glass/

Nothing clandestine happened, but seven months later Theresa picked up her pen and wrote to this attractive stranger. From the beginning, her exchange with William followed a troublesome pattern: Theresa passionately throwing herself at a man who remained reluctant and evasive.

Some of his ballets remain controversial for their style, which could include aspects of exaggerated and repetitious expressionism, sexual imagery in nonsexual contexts, acrobatic hyperextension, over-manipulative partnering and jerkily mechanical pure-dance routines. And almost every ballet he ever made remains controversial for its deficiencies of construction: individual dances are too long or too irrelevant, certain scenes are expressively unclear, overall organization has too many loose ends.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/london-dance-journal-macmillans-the-judas-tree/

See a Shootout,"TWO evenings or so every month, the director Shawn Levy and his wife arrange a sitter for their three daughters and drive to Giorgio Baldi, an Italian restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. “It’s our date night,” Mr. Levy, whose films include “Cheaper by the Dozen” and the “Night at the Museum” series, said by phone recently. The couple, who have been married for 14 years, always order the same thing: ravioli, sole, langoustines. Out at dinner a few years ago, Mr. Levy recalled, “it occurred to us as we were talking that we were just checking off boxes  which gift we had to buy for some kid’s birthday, what plans we had to get done, what happened with our daughter at school that day.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/movies/04date.html

2010-04-02,"The Bun Report | Hot, Cross and Sticky","Lately, buns — sometimes holy — have been on everyone’s minds, bodies and menus. As a nod to Good Friday, with apologies to anyone who’s off leavened items this week, here’s a guide to the Big Apple’s best buns: sticky, cinnamon, hot cross and otherwise:STICKY BUNSLet’s start at the very beginning with a small bakery on Madison Avenue at 83rd Street, William Greenberg Jr. Desserts. When I was a child, my father went here for schnecken. The German word for snail, its reference is the spiral shape of the thing. In fact, while I identify schnecken with this particular rich-doughed, cinnamon-filled, raisin-laden, pecan-topped, caramelized breakfast staple, the label is as generic as “danish,” and can be used to describe any flattened, coiled, cinnamon-raisin pastry. Sadly, William Jr. sold his bakery a number of years ago and the goods don’t taste the same. If you want to experience a sticky bun as I knew it, you can go two blocks down to E.A.T., where Eli Zabar has created something that rivals the Greenberg classic. Or else call Scarsdale, where William’s son Seth continues to bake (and sell) his father’s schnecken. Seth uses the same ingredients as his dad and has the original 1930s recipe cards to prove it. You can taste the sour cream and butter in the dough; the perfectly burnt brown sugar in the thick glaze.

Next to the Crucifixion itself (whose violent details I spared my son and daughter until age 7 or so), the image of a man-size rodent that lurches around people’s houses late at night, clutching fragile treats in its curled paws, strikes me as one of the most appalling nightmare visions that adults can inflict on tender minds.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/magazine/04fob-wwln-t.html

The villa, which reopened to the public in 2008, is one of four house museums that will host more than 200 pieces of 21st-century design for ‘‘Unexpected Guests,’’ one of the headline exhibitions of Milan’s design week. Among other interventions are a Nacho Carbonell chair and Steven Holl credenza in the Museo Bagatti Valsecchi; ceramics by the upstart Tomás Alonso in the Casa Museo Boschi Di Stefano’s Lucio Fontana gallery; and at the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Gaetano Pesce’s La Michetta modular sofa for Meritalia (above) and Front’s horse-shaped lamp for Moooi, which displaced an armored steed.

2010-04-06,‘Looped’ to Close,"The new Broadway play “Looped,” starring Valerie Harper as Tallulah Bankhead, will close on Sunday at the Lyceum Theater, the producers announced on Monday, after failing to draw much audience interest over its six weeks of performances. For its eight performances last week, for instance, “Looped” grossed $168,351, only 26 percent of the maximum possible amount. At such a low percentage, “Looped” was probably not covering its weekly running expenses, let alone turning a profit. (The weekly expenses have not been made public.) Moreover, the show was not on an upward trajectory; last week’s gross represented a decline from the previous week’s amount, $176,622. Written by Matthew Lombardo (“Tea at Five”) and directed by Rob Ruggiero, “Looped” will have played 27 preview performances and 25 regular performances when it closes. A spokesman for the show did not immediately reply to questions about the total cost for mounting the production and whether it will close at a complete loss for investors. The play is a portrait of Ms. Bankhead at the end of her film career, as she arrives, apparently drunk, at an editing studio to rerecord a line of dialogue for a movie  setting the stage for a colorful showdown between the actress and an uptight film editor. Ms. Harper drew generally positive reviews for her bravura turn as Bankhead, though the reviews for the overall production were mixed to negative.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/theater/06arts-LOOPEDTOCLOS_BRF.html

In a post at the official Facebook page for the West End production of “Wicked,” its producers wrote: “The posting of film and audio recordings from performances is ILLEGAL and strictly prohibited. All such posts will be removed and the FANatic banned from future performances.” Michael McCabe, the executive producer of the London production, said the message was posted at the behest of the Ambassador Theater Group, which owns the Apollo Victoria Theater where “Wicked” is presented, after an incident in which a fan recorded the entire performance and posted it on YouTube. A representative for the show’s Broadway production, which is at the Gershwin Theater, said it did not have a formal policy banning audience members who are caught recording or pirating the show.

Infighting Hindered Efforts to Recover Stolen Art,"Was an effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to recover stolen Vermeer and Rembrandt works undone by infighting at the agency? That assertion is made by Robert K. Wittman, a retired special agent, in a coming book titled “Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World’s Stolen Treasures,” which details his efforts in 2006 and 2007 to retrieve the paintings, The Boston Globe reported. In “Priceless” Mr. Wittman writes that French middlemen with ties to a criminal gang in Corsica offered to sell the stolen paintings to him, believing that he was a rich collector. The works were among more than $500 million in art stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston on March 18, 1990, in what is regarded as the biggest art theft in American history and which remains unsolved after two decades. The Globe reported that Mr. Wittman wrote that his efforts were sabotaged by a superior, called Fred in the book, who micromanaged his work and tried to have him thrown off the case. The F.B.I. told The Globe that it was reviewing the manuscript to see if it revealed any secrets that could damage its investigations or national security. Representatives for Crown Publishing, which is releasing “Priceless,” said Mr. Wittman would not comment until the book was published in June.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/arts/design/06arts-NEWBOOKSAYSF_BRF.html

Sukwoo is talking about Korea’s younger generation, the K-pop kids now in their late teens and early 20s who have plenty of disposable cash and a burning desire to be unique, but who barely have a clue who they are. Sukwoo, at the ripe age of 28, already considers himself part of an earlier “not so beautiful, but perhaps more thoughtful” generation. For the past four years, he has been filling his Your Boyhood blog (yourboyhood.com) with the photos he takes of Seoul’s jeunesse dorée and essays that read like sad, disjointed poems (at least when you try to decipher them with your computer’s instant translator). For him the blog is still in the early stages of a project he imagines will take him about 10 more years: to record the passing youth of one of Asia’s — and the world’s — speediest fast-track cultures. “Young Koreans haven’t found their own style yet, so they’re copying images they find on the Internet,” he says. “It’s a form of stylish cosplay.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/seoul-survivor-a-front-row-report-from-korean-fashion-week/

Not Exactly | As residents on both sides of the Mexican border cleaned up after Sunday’s earthquake, the authorities warned that many Californians remained unprepared for a serious quake, and emergency officials said that budget cuts have strained their ability to handle a disaster. The budget challenges faced by firefighters and other first responders have probably affected preparedness, fire officials say, particularly in remote or lightly populated areas that often depend on larger cities or agencies for help in emergencies. Sunday’s quake registered 7.2 and centered in a largely unpopulated area of northern Mexico. But a recent study by the California Emergency Management Agency found a majority of the state’s households failing to meet recommendations for many basic emergency needs, like stockpiling water (a minimum of three gallons per person), reinforcing their homes and making disaster plans. “We know that there’s going to be an earthquake, and we know it’s going to be a major natural disaster,” said Lou Paulson, president of the California Professional Firefighters and a captain in the Contra Costa County fire protection district. “And I don’t want to be one of the people who stands in front of the state of California and says, ‘We told you so.’ ” [The New York Times]",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/sampler-lack-of-attention-for-earthquake-preparations-and-more-attention-for-story-of-stuff/

Pondering these trends, Miller argues that some kind of immortality of the soul is simply “easier to swallow” than a physical resurrection; the latter, she suggests, presents all sorts of “credibility problems” that the “more reasonable” belief in purely spiritual afterlife lacks.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/the-resurrection-and-the-life/

At a news conference on Tuesday, the opera company said it was preparing to move west to Berlin’s Schiller Theater as the Staatsoper building, which opened on the Unter den Linden boulevard in 1844, begins a $321 million restoration project. Rehearsals in the Schiller Theater, which is contending with its own renovations, are to begin Aug. 19, and the Staatsoper’s 2010-2011 season will open there on Oct. 3 with the world premiere of Jens Joneleit’s “Metanoia,” directed by Christoph Schlingensief. Other conductors who are scheduled to lead the Staatsoper during the season include James Levine and Pierre Boulez. At the news conference, Daniel Barenboim, the music director for the Staatsoper, said, “Moving for three years can be seen as a calamity or as a challenge, and we have decided to see it as the latter.” Its artistic director, Jürgen Flimm, said it would be difficult for operagoers to follow the company to its new home, adding: “I hope there will be sufficient curiosity. That’s why we are doing so much.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/berlin-staatsoper-prepares-to-move/

(Did we mention this was the ’80s?) The MCM ads were equally flashy, featuring Crawford perched on a pile of suitcases or posing wearing nothing except a giant MCM logo. (If that weren’t enough, they were signed “I want my MCM” and “The beginning of a beautiful friendship.” Awwww.) And while you might think that such naked consumption went the way of the world economy, you would think wrong. Not only has the brand been on a store opening spree with 15 new Saks Fifth Avenue boutiques and a Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive boutique scheduled for later this year, but it has signed on as a sponsor for New York fashion week. MCM is even recreating its Cindy Crawford campaign, this time around with the model Coco Rocha.

But Nicollette Sheridan, below, a former star of that ABC prime-time serial, says those same conditions existed behind the scenes at the show, whose producers she is suing, asserting she was assaulted and wrongfully terminated, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Sheridan, who played Edie Britt on the first five seasons of “Desperate Housewives,” said the show’s creator, Marc Cherry, hit her during an incident in September 2008. When Ms. Sheridan asked Mr. Cherry about a line in the script, he “took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head,” the suit said, according to The A.P. When Ms. Sheridan complained to ABC, she was ignored and her character was later killed off in retaliation, she said. ABC and Cherry Alley Productions, Mr. Cherry’s company, have not yet responded to the suit, which was filed on Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/arts/television/07arts-NICOLLETTESH_BRF.html
2010-04-07,Broadway Opening for ‘Love Never Dies’ Is Delayed Until 2011,"The Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical, “Love Never Dies,” a sequel to his “Phantom of the Opera,” will be delayed several months until spring 2011 as Mr. Lloyd Webber deals with “post-operative problems” from treatment for prostate cancer, according to a statement on Tuesday from the show’s Broadway producers. While Mr. Lloyd Webber’s cancer has been “eradicated,” the statement said, his doctors have asked him to avoid long airplane flights, which apparently have aggravated his condition, according to the statement. The producers did not provide details about the health of Mr. Lloyd Webber, 62, though they said he was well enough to continue appearing on a new BBC television series about his search for an actress to play Dorothy in a new production of “The Wizard of Oz.” Asked why Mr. Lloyd Webber did not postpone the television show and instead base himself in New York to work on the musical, executives involved in the Broadway production said he had a commitment to the BBC show. Mr. Lloyd Webber was not available for a telephone interview, a spokesman for the Broadway production said, though he said in a statement that he was “extremely frustrated” by the limitations on his travel. Two Broadway theater executives who met with Mr. Lloyd Webber in London in March, when “Love Never Dies” opened there, said that he reported feeling well and did not complain of post-treatment problems. “Love Never Dies” drew mixed reviews from critics in London, including a tough critique from The New York Times’s chief theater critic, Ben Brantley, prompting speculation that the Broadway run would be delayed so Mr. Lloyd Webber could overhaul it. The musical had been scheduled to open in November at the Neil Simon Theater.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/theater/07arts-BROADWAYOPEN_BRF.html
2010-04-07,More Legal Woes for Annie Leibovitz,"The photographer Annie Leibovitz, below, whose protracted legal troubles had seemed to be behind her, is back in court. Brunswick Capital Partners has filed a suit against her in New York State Supreme Court, saying that she owes the firm several hundred thousand dollars in fees for its role in finding investors who have helped her restructure her debt, Reuters reported. Ms. Leibovitz fell into financial trouble, according to friends, after years of incautious spending and expensive home renovations. Last month she reached an agreement with Colony Capital, a Los Angeles firm: it became her only creditor and agreed to help her concentrate on her career and earnings. She averted a foreclosure last summer after she missed a deadline to repay $24 million in loans to Art Capital Group, a lender that used the rights to her photographs and her real estate as collateral. In the new lawsuit, filed on Friday, Brunswick Capital says that Ms. Leibovitz has failed to pay fees for its services and a 2 percent commission on the $40 million loan that Colony made to consolidate her debt. Representatives for Ms. Leibovitz and Colony declined to comment, saying that they had not had a chance to review the suit.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/arts/design/07arts-MORELEGALWOE_BRF.html

The celebrity dancers earned the largest audience of the night and gave a lift to ABC’s 10 p.m. show “Castle” (12.3 million), but CBS ranked a very strong second place, broadcasting a repeat of “The Big Bang Theory” at 8 (10.8 million) and a new episode of “Rules of Engagement” at 8:30 (10.2 million), followed by live coverage of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball championship game. Preliminary estimates show that the game between Duke and Butler universities, won by Duke 61-59, garnered a larger audience than last year’s championship game, which drew 17.7 million viewers when final ratings were released.

At 9:16 one called the New York City Fire Department, which soon arrived and found that the gel on a stage light had burned, sending an odor through the ventilation system. No fire was detected and “the whole incident was closed in 9 minutes and 45 seconds,” a fire department spokesman said.

The idea behind the site — which that week was reaching something of a viral mass — is pretty straightforward: cut and paste a selection of those placid, sparsely populated house shots from magazines like Dwell and run the snarkiest captions imaginable beneath them. “He’d become a caricature of what it meant to be a young, monied follower” is a typical entry. “Oh, my God,” Selby said, scrolling through the site with what appeared to be a mixture of astonishment and appreciation, as if meeting a fellow traveler. After all, Selby’s vérité approach to photographing personal spaces is precisely in tune with the urge to skewer those magazines that celebrate sleek minimalism while scorning clutter like the long-suffering mother of a teenage son.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/how-this-half-lives/

2010-04-08,‘American Idol’ Ratings Hit a Low Mark,"The chops-licking over the declining performance of Fox’s “American Idol” may grow more intense in the wake of the Tuesday night ratings for that perennial powerhouse. Fewer people watched “Idol” on Tuesday (when the contestant Crystal Bowersox performed with the didgeridoo player Ernie Fields, both left) than watched ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” on Monday. (“Dancing” runs performance episodes on Mondays, with results on Tuesdays; “Idol” generally has performance on Tuesdays with results on Wednesdays.) And for a second consecutive week, in the category Fox cares most about  viewers between the ages of 18 and 49  “Idol,” if the Tuesday overnight ratings hold, will post its lowest number ever for a two-hour edition of the show. It will also be the lowest-rated Tuesday edition of the show since an hourlong episode on Aug. 13, 2002, in its first season, when the series played in the summer. “Idol” had a total audience of about 20.4 million on Tuesday, below the 21.2 million that “Dancing” averaged for its performance show on Monday. (The “Dancing” results on Tuesday averaged a total audience of 12.3 million.) But the “Idol” 7.1 rating among viewers 18 to 49 is what will be most noticed. That is down from a 7.7 a week ago and down from the 8.1 the show averaged for the three previous weeks. Of course, “Idol” is still the dominant show on television with those younger adults advertisers love. And the success of “Dancing” has to be tempered by its skew toward older viewers. This week’s “Dancing” results episode, when the astronaut Buzz Aldrin was blasted off the show, faced the “Idol” performance on Tuesday night and scored a modest 2.4 rating in the 18 to 49 group. More tellingly, almost 70 percent of its audience was over 50.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/arts/television/08arts-AMERICANIDOL_BRF.html

The archives were put up for sale by the design historians John and Marilyn Neuhart, who are in their 80s and had collaborated with the Eameses on exhibitions and books. But on Monday Lucia Eames, the designers’ daughter, filed suit in an Illinois state court asserting that the family owns the material. The lot was estimated to bring $150,000 to $200,000. Richard Wright, the auction house owner, said, “Trying to sell these items with a cloud over the title doesn’t make any sense.” He said he would still offer a four-foot-wide model that the Neuharts built of the Eames office in Los Angeles (estimated at $10,000 to $15,000).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/arts/design/08arts-DESIGNARCHIV_BRF.html

2010-04-08,Speak Easy | Laura Marling,"Laura Marling is the most prominent member of a loose community of young London-based performers, including Johnny Flynn and Mumford and Sons, playing acoustic music inspired by British and American folk traditions. Her debut album, “Alas I Cannot Swim,” was recorded when she was 17 and nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize. This week her follow-up, “I Speak Because I Can” (Astralwerks), was released in the United States. The album has been greeted by a sweep of five-star reviews in British newspapers, earning comparisons to Joni Mitchell’s “Court and Spark.” In a warm, dusty voice and accompanied by her intuitive guitar playing, Marling sings of being perched between adolescence and womanhood, between the rural England where she was raised and the anxious metropolis she has made her home, between despair and freedom. Marling spoke with The Moment during her recent American tour.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/speak-easy-laura-marling/

2010-04-08,‘Russia Against Napoleon’,"There are usually three stages in the creation of empires, though these stages often overlap. First comes the conquest of empire and the elimination of foreign threats. This is generally a question of military power, diplomatic craftiness, and geopolitical context. To survive, however, an empire needs institutions, otherwise it will disintegrate with the death of the conqueror and his charisma. Establishing these institutions is the second stage in creating an empire and is often harder than the first stage, particularly when huge conquests have occurred in a short period. The third stage requires the consolidation of imperial loyalties and identities in the subject populations, and above all, in the pre-modern world, in their elites.

Any serious discussions of pedagogic method and what Steiner called his “spiritual science,” anthroposophy, took place out of earshot in the teachers’ room. My only mental picture of Steiner (1861-1925) came from a dim black and white photo showing a stern mouth and X-ray eyes that made me glad this guy wasn’t our headmaster.

He slowed down, sped up. “No!” he bellowed for nobelium, then finally whispered “Lr,” the last chemical symbol. He turned to face the audience. “I’ve always wondered if I should have ended with ‘No’ rather than putting that ‘Lr’ on the end. I think it was a mistake. I think it would have been more emphatic with the negation.” This was the funniest, most impromptu-­brilliant, serious moment I’ve ever witnessed at a poetry reading — and very much about sound, language, expression and communication.

The strips are woven with nylon thread to make the paper more durable and finished with a water-based topcoat that helps protect against yellowing and staining. Newsworthy is 47 inches wide and $125 a yard (to the trade). Information: (888) 609-5551, weitznerlimited.com.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/garden/08wallpaper.html

New air handling equipment was installed as part of an $11.5 million restoration of the Corcoran’s roof and skylight system, which was completed last month. (The museum previously closed for the renovation for seven weeks in early 2009.) A spokeswoman for the museum, Kristin Guiter, said the humidity levels at no point fluctuated outside the acceptable range defined in the museum’s contract with the American Federation of Arts, which organized the show with the National Museum Wales. “The art was not actually at risk,” Ms. Guiter said, but “we proactively opted to shut the show.” The exhibition, of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings and works on paper from the collection of two sisters, Gwendoline and Margaret Davies, had been well reviewed. Most had never been shown in the United States before.

Representatives for Actors’ Equity said that about three to four weeks ago Broadway Entertainment, which produces “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding,” posted a closing notice for the show that would end its run at the Edison Hotel. Since then, the association said, the producers have sought a new performance space, violating an Equity rule that producers cannot close and reopen a show within eight weeks without negotiating with the union. (The producers said that on Saturday the show would move to Sweet Caroline’s on West 45th Street.) Equity said in its complaint to the labor board that Broadway Entertainment had failed to recognize the union and had offered employment to its cast members on the condition they resign from Equity or work without its representation. In November the Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, protested “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding” after Broadway Entertainment replaced musicians with recorded music. In a statement Broadway Entertainment said that it was “concerned about our cast,” adding, “We did not intend to violate any rules by Equity but felt we had a responsibility as their employers to offer everyone a fair chance to continue working.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/theater/09arts-EQUITYFILESC_BRF.html

When the film opens, his sister is whisking her family off, leaving the couple alone. It’s an ideal setup for Gitti and Chris, who can’t keep their hands off each other, and in whose half-dressed bodies you can see and feel the heat of the island, the eroticism too.

Yet Norris Church Mailer’s reminiscence, “A Ticket to the Circus,” still manages to add a fat new sheaf to the public dossier on her late husband, Norman Mailer, and tells an involving coming-of-age story to boot. It’s not so much that she gives readers unexpected insights into one of the literary giants of his day — the book does little to dispel the image of Mailer as a narcissistic hothead with redeeming streaks of cuddliness and charm — but rather that, in her own in­direct way, she shows exactly what type of woman could tolerate and at least partly subdue such a king-size corkscrew of a man. The book will be of interest to anyone who works in a university marriage lab. It also shows that Norman wasn’t the only talented raconteur in the family.

The intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, made the charges on Iran’s English-language satellite channel. Coming as international tension over Iran’s nuclear program has increased, the remarks seemed to reflect a hardening of the Iranian government’s tone in the case of the hikers — Sarah Shourd, 31, and Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, both 27. In November, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran pointed out that the United States was holding several Iranian citizens, raising the possibility that he sought a prisoner swap. “Clearly, these unlucky hikers have been caught up in international politics,” said Mark Juergensmeyer, director of the global and international studies department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “The message is loud and clear: It screams for a prisoners’ exchange and shows that they are being kept as hostages to be used as negotiating pawns.” [The San Francisco Chronicle, The Oakland Tribune]",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/sampler-berkeley-hikers-called-spies-grateful-deads-archivist-ronald-reagans-day/

2010-04-09,Survey Says,"Back in 2005, when Democrats in Congress fought to preserve their right to filibuster against George W. Bush’s judicial nominees, they spoke in unison about how Republicans were “changing the rules in the middle of the game,” a slogan they had tested with focus groups like a catchphrase for breakfast cereal. The idea was to turn an arcane question of process into a basic issue of fairness in the public mind, and it worked. Now, five years later, Republicans reeling from their health care defeat are trying the same tactic. The health care law was “rammed through Congress and rammed down the throats of the American people,” Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina declared on “Face the Nation,” echoing a chorus of other Republicans who have used the same metaphor to cast the law’s passage — accomplished partly through the technical process known as budget reconciliation — as an act of outright treachery.

In recent years, however, Guinea-Bissau has emerged as a nodal point in three-way cocaine-trafficking operations linking producers in South America with users in Europe; the value of the cocaine that transits this small and heartbreakingly impoverished country dwarfs its gross national product. The Gulfstream arrived unexpectedly from Venezuela on July 12, 2008, and taxied to a hangar at the adjacent military airbase — where soldiers formed a line and unloaded its contents. The contents, reportedly more than a half-ton of cocaine, vanished. The crew was arrested and released. The army permitted the government to impound the plane only after several days. Since then, the plane has sat in the harsh sun, a reminder of Guinea-Bissau’s helplessness before forces far more powerful than itself.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/magazine/11Trade-t.html

But any who take the leap may use their worldliness to good advantage, smuggling gems of empirical knowledge across the literary border to create fiction with unusually rewarding heft. Consider the meticulous puzzle­-solving of Sir ­Arthur Conan Doyle (a trained surgeon) or the flights of physics in Alan Lightman’s “Einstein’s Dreams.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Kingsolver-t.html

In “Taming the Gods: Religion and Democracy on Three Continents,” he writes intimately about the relationship between politics and faith in Britain, the Netherlands, France, China, Japan and the United States. And beneath every cliché — about American religious fervor, French intolerance or Japanese godlessness — he uncovers ironies that wreak havoc with popular stereotypes. Buruma shows, for instance, that the trendy, anti-imperial multiculturalism favored in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom actually echoes those countries’ policies of colonial indirect rule, in which native cultures were segregated and preserved so they could be dominated more easily. He suggests that America’s militant Christianity and Europe’s militant secularism stem from parallel anxieties about the pace of cultural change. And he explains why the jihadist fanaticism taking root among some of Europe’s Muslim young is more European than Middle Eastern, more modern than traditional, more political than religious.

Because Italy does not have a robust reading culture, the fact that this literary debut has sold more than a million copies there hints both at the extraordinary magnetism of Giordano’s voice and at the human interest lurking behind the left-brain mathi­ness of his ­title.

According to Sunday’s estimates from Team Screenline, a box-office data service, 20th Century Fox’s “Date Night” earned $27.1 million in its first weekend, putting it just a hair ahead of Warner Brothers’ “Titans,” which earned $26.9 million in its second weekend, with a cumulative total of $110.5 million. Weekend projections are fairly solid for Friday and Saturday totals, but some studios claim competitors bloat Sunday estimates, which are based on how similar movies performed in past weekends, The Associated Press reported. Warner Brothers said “Titans” finished about $1 million over “Date Night,” according to The A.P. “They’re certainly entitled to their own projection, and we’ll see,” said Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution for Warner. “Maybe they’re right, and we’re wrong.” Paramount’s “How to Train Your Dragon” was third in its third weekend, with $23.4 million (just under $134 million total). “Tyler Perry’s Why Did I Get Married Too” (Lionsgate) was fourth with only $11 million in its second week ($48.5 million total). “The Last Song” (Disney) finished fifth with $10 million in its second weekend ($42.5 million total).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/movies/12arts-TITANSANDCOM_BRF.html

No fewer than 34 composers will be represented in this year’s outing, which runs July 27 to Aug. 21. Many of those are contemporary figures, represented in a six-concert series, “Bach and Polyphonies,” organized by the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who is artist in residence. Louis Langrée, the festival’s music director, and the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra will open and close the season with (mostly) Mozart. There will also be Mozart orchestral evenings conducted by Lionel Bringuier and Osmo Vanska, and smaller-scale programs devoted to Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin. The Handel ode, a festival favorite in the 1988 production by the choreographer Mark Morris, will return for three performances at the David H. Koch Theater (Aug. 5-7).

Ms. Costello, now 48, recalled that as the tickling and touching quickly progressed to fondling her chest and genitals, Mr. Kiesle justified his behavior as exorcism and “told me the devil was inside me,” she said in an interview with The New York Times. Emerging accounts like Ms. Costello’s in California churches have intensified pressure on the pope. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then a top Vatican official overseeing clergy, he sent a letter in 1985 to Bishop John S.

A week after his pitch-perfect rendition of “I Will Always Love You” made him an online sensation, Lin Yu-chun, above, a 24-year-old contestant on the “One Million Star” show, a Taiwanese talent competition, was voted off the program, Agence France-Presse reported. Video of Mr. Lin, a shop worker who has been nicknamed Little Fatty, singing that Whitney Houston-by-way-of-Dolly Parton love ballad, was widely circulated on the Internet and was viewed more than four million times on YouTube. But those numbers apparently meant nothing to the show’s viewers and judges, who criticized Mr. Lin’s performance of a Mandarin song on the next week’s broadcast. (“You rarely hit a wrong note,” one judge said. “But you did today. What’s wrong with you?”) Stella Teng, an agent for Mr. Lin, told Agence France-Presse: “Despite the failure he still keeps a positive attitude. He feels that success cannot possibly come without failure.” Ms. Teng said that Mr. Lin would be invited back on “One Million Star” as a guest performer next week, and may give interviews or concerts in other territories, including the United States.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/television/13arts-ABRIEFSENSAT_BRF.html

But she’s not just any social-media-savvy teenager; she’s the online avatar for Juliet Capulet in a 21st-century update of “Romeo and Juliet” that the Royal Shakespeare Company has started online. BBC News reported that during the project, which is called “Such Tweet Sorrow” and will run for five weeks, actors playing Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers (who had their disagreements about the chirping of birds) and other characters from that tragedy will play out the story on Twitter and react to real-life events. Charlotte Wakefield, an actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company who is playing Juliet (above, with the actor James Barrett), has already tweeted about her new bed and her beloved deceased mother, as well as the Robert Pattinson cutout she keeps in her bedroom. Michael Boyd, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, told the BBC that the project tries to bring performers and theatergoers closer together. “Mobile phones don’t need to be the antichrist for theater,” he said.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/theater/13arts-POSTSBYSHAKE_BRF.html

On Monday Mr. Waters, the onetime Pink Floyd singer, songwriter and bassist, gave in to the demands of ornery students everywhere and announced a concert-tour version of “The Wall,” his former band’s concept album about post-World War II disillusionment, rock stardom and the anguish of being pursued by groupies. Billboard reported that Mr. Waters would begin the 36-date tour on Sept. 15 in Toronto and conclude it on Dec. 13 in Anaheim, Calif. Concerts, which will, of course, feature a 35-foot-tall, 240-foot-wide wall on stage, are also scheduled for Madison Square Garden (Oct. 5) and the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J. (Nov. 3). Billboard said that “The Wall” had been performed live only 31 times by Pink Floyd or Mr. Waters, who left the group in the mid-1980s: in a series of concerts the band played in 1980 and 1981, and by Mr. Waters in 1990 to mark the fall of the Berlin Wall.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/music/13arts-ALLINALLITSJ_BRF.html

She will star as a CNN executive who unexpectedly encounters a man with whom she had an adolescent fling years earlier, and the two find that their romanticized memories of youth are complicated by adult realities. Her co-star is Paul Sparks, above, who played Ejlert Lovborg in last season’s Broadway revival of “Hedda Gabler” and has acted Off Broadway most recently in “Pumpgirl” and “Essential Self-Defense.” Ms. Walsh, who trained at the Piven Theater Workshop and Oxford School of Drama, starred in several plays in Chicago and elsewhere before taking television roles on “The Drew Carey Show,” “Karen Sisco” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” on which she created the character she now plays on “Private Practice.” The play by Mr. Belber (“Match,” “Geometry of Fire”) will be directed by Sam Gold (“Circle Mirror Transformation”) at the Atlantic’s Stage 2 at 330 West 16th Street in Chelsea.

In its weekend editions, L’Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Vatican, commemorated the Beatles on the 40th anniversary of that group’s breakup, and endorsed the Fab Four’s music without quite giving a thumbs-up to the band members’ lifestyles, The Associated Press reported. “It’s true, they took drugs; swept up by their success, they lived dissolute and uninhibited lives,” L’Osservatore Romano wrote. “But,” the newspaper added, “listening to their songs, all of this seems distant and meaningless. Their beautiful melodies, which changed forever pop music and still give us emotions, live on like precious jewels.” Giovanni Maria Vian, the editor in chief of L’Osservatore Romano, told The A.P. that he is a fan of the Beatles, and he minimized John Lennon’s notorious 1966 remark that the band at that time was “more popular than Jesus.” “In reality it wasn’t that scandalous,” Mr. Vian said, “because the fascination with Jesus was so great that it attracted these new heroes of the time.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/music/13arts-VATICANGETSA_BRF.html

The lawsuit, which The New York Post reported was filed by Mr. Valli, as well as his band mate Bob Gaudio and the playwrights Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, says that “The Boys in Concert” copies many elements of “Jersey Boys” and that its promotional materials represent “a deliberate and willful attempt to create public confusion and foster the misimpression” that the shows are “associated or connected.” The “Jersey Boys” producers are seeking damages and an injunction against performances of “The Boys in Concert” that use copyrighted or similar materials.

2010-04-13,Milan Report | Fornasetti Remix,"It’s the start of design week here in Milan, and our first event was an off-site exhibit at one of our favorite galleries: Nilufar. Run by Nina Yashar, the gallery-cum-high-end-design-boutique specializes in antique design masterpieces as well as newly commissioned works by young designers. The standout at this year’s exhibition, however, was a bit old and a bit new. The designer Barnaba Fornasetti, son of the legendary Piero Fornasetti, has made newly commissioned pieces out of some of his father’s classic collaborations with the famed designer Gio Ponti. Instead of making these pieces in the high-gloss lacquer that is a Fornasetti trademark, these new works are covered in the original zinc lithographic plates that papa Fornasetti used to print his famous designs. The matte gray zinc is embellished in a black etched patchwork of flowers, trompe l’oeil books, faux bois and more. The zinc plates are attached to the wooden construction of the furniture by way of utilitarian yet decorative nail heads. The collection consists of two desks, a tall secretary desk, a chair, a chandelier and a wardrobe (in which Barnaba has even placed some of his own idiosyncratic Fornasetti printed suits, vests and shirts). All of the pieces are unique and are destined to become instant, if remixed, classics.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/milan-report-fornasetti-remix/

The series mixes actors like Steve Zahn, Wendell Pierce and Clarke Peters with real-life musicians like Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint; the pedigree of David Simon, who created “Treme” with Eric Overmyer, and who also produced “The Wire” and “The Corner” for HBO, probably didn’t hurt, either.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/hbo-orders-second-geaux-round-for-new-orleans-series-treme/

It’s as intriguing coming as it is going. Lynn was inspired by the T’s combination of hard lines and curvilinear flourishes and scrolls. “This is something I have a great affinity for,” he says. “The combination of the hard-edged and the curvaceous.” View interactive >>",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/super-modeling-t-by-greg-lynn/

Chairman Testifies on Capitol Hill," Rocco Landesman, left, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, delivered his first budget testimony before a House subcommittee on Tuesday, arguing for the arts as a source of jobs and an economic stimulus. The Obama administration has requested a $161.3 million budget for the endowment for fiscal year 2011, the same as its request for 2010, but less than the $167.5 million budget that Congress ultimately passed. Mr. Landesman has put his stamp on the budget, cutting a program known as American Masterpieces (though sparing one of its most popular components, the Big Read) and devoting $5 million to a pilot program, Our Town, that will support the creation of local arts districts. When Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, asked what he would do if Congress gave him $180 million, Mr. Landesman replied that Our Town could be expanded to reach more than the 35 communities currently planned. The chairman of the subcommittee, Jim Moran, Democrat of Virginia, who was in a jocular mood, congratulated Mr. Landesman several times on having hit the trifecta at the Kentucky Derby in 2001.

The original interviews with Mrs. Kennedy took place in the spring of 1964 with the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. as part of an oral history project intended to preserve memories of Kennedy and his administration. In the seven interviews, Hyperion said, Mrs. Kennedy discusses various subjects including her husband’s election campaigns; his handling of challenges like the Cuban missile crisis; her role as a wife, mother and first lady; and what her husband would have done in a second term as president. The book, still untitled, is planned for release in September 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy presidency, and is being edited by the Kennedys’ daughter, Caroline. In a statement, Caroline Kennedy said: “My mother’s passion for history guided and informed her work in the White House. She believed in my father, his vision for America, and in the art of politics.

2010-04-14,China: Leader to Visit Indonesia," A powerful earthquake in northwest China killed at least 67 people and left many others buried under debris early Wednesday, the official Xinhua news agency said. The quake, which struck at 7:49 a.m. in Qinghai Province, was reported as having a magnitude of 7.1 by China’s earthquake administration. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded it as 6.9. Xinhua said the earthquake had struck 240 miles southeast of Golmud, a town of about 130,000 on the Tibetan plateau. Golmud is perhaps best known as the site of the world’s largest salt lake. “Soldiers have been dispatched to save the people buried in the collapsed houses,” Huang Limin, a local official, told Xinhua. He said phone service, briefly cut off by the quake, had been restored. The Geological Survey reported three aftershocks, with magnitudes of up to 5.8. Last August, Golmud was hit by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that destroyed dozens of homes but caused no deaths. Qinghai is an ethnic melting pot of Tibetans, Mongols and Han Chinese.

The recovery could take longer depending on the toxicity of the ship’s exterior paint, which is designed to prevent the growth of barnacles and other marine life. The Shen Neng 1 crashed onto a shoal near the southern end of the reef on April 3, then ground back and forth against the nearby coral until it was refloated late Monday. The scar on the reef is 1.9 miles long and up to 820 feet wide. About three tons of engine fuel were spilled. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/asia/14briefs-Australia.html

Continuing the “South Park” tradition of satirizing every organized religion from Roman Catholicism to Scientology, the musical, called “The Book of Mormon,” will juxtapose a tale of two young Mormon missionaries with the story of Joseph Smith, who founded Mormonism in the 19th century (a topic that “South Park” has covered). Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker wrote the book, music and lyrics with Mr. Lopez, a Tony Award winner for “Avenue Q.” Mr. Parker will direct with Jason Moore (“Avenue Q,” “Shrek the Musical”). Scott Rudin and Anne Garefino will produce “The Book of Mormon”; no cast or theater has been announced. In January Off Broadway’s New York Theater Workshop announced plans to produce the musical this August and September. A workshop spokesman noted that “Rent” and two Claudia Shear comedies began there, adding, “I am sorry this show isn’t following the same route.” A spokesman for the Broadway production said: “The workshop did help with a previous reading, but then a decision was made to go directly to Broadway.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/arts/15arts-SOUTHPARKCRE_BRF.html
2010-04-15,Herzog in a Cave,"Can there be a 3-D movie about a work of art that predates the discovery of perspective? If anyone can make such a film, surely Werner Herzog can. The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Mr. Herzog, the director of “Grizzly Man” and “Fitzcarraldo,” is working on a movie that will take audiences inside a French cave containing drawings that are more than 30,000 years old. In a video interview on the blog of Roger Ebert, the film critic of The Chicago Sun-Times, Mr. Herzog said that he had been given permission to film inside the Chauvet Cave in the Ardèche region of France, whose walls are decorated with more than 300 images of rhinoceroses, bison and other animals. (Due to the risk of damage to the drawings, the site is usually restricted to visitors.) “It’s still tough to bring equipment down,” Mr. Herzog said. He added: “We are doing something nobody has done with 3-D.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/movies/15arts-HERZOGINACAV_BRF.html

2010-04-15,Dream Girl," Much as we might rag on it, the awful truth must be looked at head-on: Reality TV, that fiction of verisimilitude, is, even for people who read W. G. Sebald and enjoy grim Scottish films with subtitles, supernally addictive. Not always and (let’s hope!) not forever, but in the right now of it. Sure, sometimes one is simply not in the mood for all that virtual id, the jawing and bitching, the glaring white teeth and the faux familiarity. And it is possible to envision a day in the not-too-far-off future when one might return to an old-fashioned pastime, like doing one’s nails, over the vicarious pleasures of comparing and contrasting the suntans and blown-out blondness that beset the Real Housewives of Orange County. Meanwhile, though, one stays tuned, fascinated by the mindless commotion, caught on the hook of the souped-up dramas that barge into every episode, unsure whether one is watching a version of oneself or a counter-version or perhaps an alternate version. Which brings me to the question: Who might one be if one were to be played by a reality-show star?

According to research commissioned by Oxfam and conducted by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, the total number of sexual assault cases handled by a major Congolese gynecological hospital decreased between 2004 and 2008. But the number of rapes committed by civilians increased 17-fold. ""Sexual violence has become more normal in civilian life,"" said Susan Bartels, one of the researchers. ""The scale of rape over Congo's years of war has made this crime seem more acceptable."" The researchers interviewed more than 4,000 women who had been raped and sought treatment at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu.

Sebald and enjoy grim Scottish films with subtitles, supernally addictive. Not always and (let’s hope!) not forever, but in the right now of it. Sure, sometimes one is simply not in the mood for all that virtual id, the jawing and bitching, the glaring white teeth and the faux familiarity. And it is possible to envision a day in the not-too-far-off future when one might return to an old-fashioned pastime, like doing one’s nails, over the vicarious pleasures of comparing and contrasting the suntans and blown-out blondness that beset the Real Housewives of Orange County. Meanwhile, though, one stays tuned, fascinated by the mindless commotion, caught on the hook of the souped-up dramas that barge into every episode, unsure whether one is watching a version of oneself or a counter-version or perhaps an alternate version. Which brings me to the question: Who might one be if one were to be played by a reality-show star? Who might one want to be? ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/dream-girl/

The tenor is appropriately prosecutorial: Goldberg builds an extensive, persuasive case that the Owenses’ much-lauded environmental activism in the Zambian hinterland led to at least one murder, and maybe more. The victim was a poacher; the killers were probably game scouts who were trained by the Owenses as a kind of private army (and encouraged to take the fight to hunters) — and the fatal gunshots, Goldberg plausibly contends, may have been fired by Mark Owens’ own son, Christopher. (Remarkably, the murder was captured on camera by an ABC documentary crew sometime in 1995; even more remarkably, it was then broadcast, on an episode of the newsmagazine show “Turning Point” in 1996.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/a-killing-in-zambia/

(Silly me, I wore flip-flops.) Tidlund, a native of Sweden and the founder, in 1976, of one of America’s first bespoke clog companies, is an orthopedic-wellness militant à la the Soup Nazi. Which is why, when I phoned Tidlund to solicit her (withering, I was certain) take on one of spring’s big trends — the befeathered, begrommeted, open-toed, high-heeled clog (see Miu Miu, above left; Louis Vuitton, above right; and Chanel) — I was surprised that she wasn’t entirely negative. First she reminded me that ‘‘we’ve seen them before.’’ Then she added, ‘‘I’d rather people get into a bad fashion clog than a ballet flat or flip-flop. Flimsy shoes are ruining people’s feet.

There he said that his new album, “Recovery,” will be released on June 22 by Aftermath/Interscope Records and will feature contributions from producers like DJ Khalil, Just Blaze, Jim Jonsin and Boi-1da. In a statement Eminem said: “I had originally planned for ‘Relapse 2’ to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to ‘Relapse’ started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album.

The shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were not victims of bullying. They did not belong to a goth “Trench Coat Mafia.” They did not single out blacks or Christians or athletes. “Eric Harris was a psychopath, simple as that,” our reviewer, Jennifer Senior, reported. “Dylan Klebold was a suicidally depressed kid who yoked his fate to a sadist.” This book by Cullen, who as a reporter in Denver covered the story for Salon and Slate, is a “fine example of old-fashioned journalism,” Senior said.

Deval Patrick, a Democrat, will go along with what would be the biggest expansion of gambling since the state introduced the lottery in 1971; Senate leaders and the governor oppose slot machines. The House vote is a sharp reversal from its vote in 2008 under a different House speaker. Wednesday’s vote was the result of a tour-de-force by Speaker Robert A.

There is a childlike immediacy and simplicity about his self-taught style, a directness that appeals to eyes trained by Modernist painting.

Also ostensibly, the novel’s plot follows the year Thomas leaves the work force to take care of their daughter and his wife returns to a full-time job. But it soon becomes apparent that the novel is not exactly about these two individuals, nor is it overly concerned with the “Mr. Mom” circumstances newly introduced into their lives. What “The Bradshaw Variations” is about, however, is hard to say. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/review/Sittenfeld-t.html

Rosie — 17, bright and sweet and anticipating the summer before her final year of high school — has come to realize how maddeningly easy it is to deceive her mother and stepfather, Elizabeth and James. So preoccupied are they with her alcoholic mother’s faltering recovery that they forget to notice whether Rosie herself is drinking (she is). In fact, they’re so clueless about her real life that when James picks a moment for an honest chat he has no idea Rosie is coming down off Ecstasy, so “tweaked” she has to struggle not to “grind her teeth into paste” as she listens.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/review/Myerson-t.html

2010-04-16,A Ripe Old Age,"Here’s how precocious Adam Thirlwell is: In 2003, when he was 24 years old, Granta named him one of Britain’s best young novelists — before his first novel had even been published. (He made the cut on the strength of the manuscript.) Once the book, “Politics,” did appear, discussions about it had one common denominator: sex. Readers and reviewers, pro and con, sought the precise location of the line demarcating smut from smart. Translated into 30 languages, “Politics” told the story of three young Londoners involved in a ménage à trois. Though few explicit descriptions were spared, the novel was ultimately less concerned with the foibles and fumblings of sexual misadventure than with what they could reveal about human nature that more conventional narratives could not.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/review/Salvatore-t.html

Nearly everyone here at the furniture fair did more with less this year, but few so overtly made an asset of the crisis, the business-killing tendencies of which inspired Droog to come to the aid of all those orphaned goods. Reclamation can also apparently benefit the bottom line, considering that 125 euros ($170) will net you one of 448 wallets stamped “Money does not make me happy” by the graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister. And silicone-coated wooden spoons by the Dutch food designer Marije Vogelzang are only 29.50 euros ($40).

We are not only what we eat, we are what we feed our children. So here in Berkeley — where a preoccupation with locally grown, organic, sustainable agriculture is presumed — the mom who strolls the farmers’ markets can feel superior to the one who buys pesticide-free produce trucked in from Mexico, who can, in turn, lord it over the one who stoops to conventionally grown carrots (though the folks who grow their own trump us all).

Easy when the palette is deployed in transparent fabrics (like the Rochas nude lace top that made it impossible not to look at the model . . . or at least at her instantly discernible nipples). Difficult when the individual and the outfit share the exact same coloring — a problem exemplified at this year’s Oscars by actresses from Demi Moore (whose apricot Versace gown blended seamlessly with her spray-on tan) to Anna Kendrick (all but invisible in pasty pink Elie Saab).

We could sneak a liquid version into his meals, but his physician said this could be considered child abuse. Yet under the circumstances, not doing so seems worse, considering that our son’s condition prevents him from making a self-healing decision. What to do?

2010-04-19,Letters: The Love That Dare Not Squawk Its Name,"Jon Mooallem nicely encapsulates for the general reader a broad panorama of observation, research and interpretation concerning a relatively little-known and probably somewhat hidden aspect of biology. Absent from the discourse, however, is any mention of the simple notion of pleasure or of the more complicated emotions. The animal kingdom at its higher levels is suffused with not only reproductive survival drives but also with pleasure-seeking drives, an area covered by the science of hedonics, a discipline with a name itself suffering the moralistic denunciations engaged to suppress much about sexual behavior. It is interesting to note that there seems little of what we would call prejudice among animal societies toward nonstandard behavior, and yet there was no discussion of this judgmental and too-often-punitive activity that emerges in nominally more advanced human animals. There is much more to this subject; the author barely mentioned things likethe cavorting of dolphins, the pansexuality of bonobos and the same-sex mating behavior seen in deep-sea octopuses.THOMAS W.

Pierrepont Finch in a revival of “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” that is planned for Broadway in the spring of 2011, its producers announced on Thursday. The musical revival, with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock and Willie Gilbert, will be Mr. Radcliffe’s first Broadway role since the revival of “Equus” that ran at the Broadhurst Theater in 2008 and 2009. Rob Ashford (“Promises, Promises”; “Curtains”) will direct “How to Succeed,” and it will be produced by Broadway Across America (John Gore, Thomas B. McGrath and Beth Williams), Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. The original production (with a cast that included Robert Morse and Charles Nelson Reilly) opened in 1961 and ran for more than 1,400 performances; a film version was released in 1967, and a previous Broadway revival, starring Matthew Broderick and Megan Mullally, was mounted in 1995.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/theater/17arts-DANIELRADCLI_BRF.html

Mr. Gilliam, the Monty Python alumnus whose films include “Brazil,” and whose disaster-plagued shoot for an aborted film, “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,” was the subject of the documentary “Lost in La Mancha,” will direct a production of Berlioz’s “Damnation of Faust” planned for May 2011. The English National Opera, which previously recruited the director Anthony Minghella to stage a successful production of “Madame Butterfly,” acknowledged that there were risks when anyone directs opera for the first time. (“It can be like a car crash coming at you from every angle,” John Berry, the opera company’s artistic director, told The Guardian.) But Edward Gardner, the company’s music director, said Mr. Gilliam has “a real grip on what needs to be done,” adding, “I can’t wait to tap into his crazy world and artistry.” Other works on the 2010-2011 calendar of the English National Opera include a production of Donizetti’s “Lucrezia Borgia” directed by Mike Figgis, who is also making his opera debut, and a new opera by Nico Muhly.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/arts/music/17arts-TERRYGILLIAM_BRF.html

On Friday, Mr. Einhorn, 89, and Mrs. Einhorn, 86, received an honor that usually goes to a millionaire donor: Primary Stages named its theater school on their behalf in recognition of their longtime commitment. The Einhorns, who have been married for 67 years, did not make a financial gift to the theater in return for naming rights, as is often the case with such tributes; rather, a Primary Stages spokesman said, they have given their time freely to handle phone calls  though they leave a bit early, at 2 p.m., on Fridays  and work on the board. The couple has long been retired; Mr. Einhorn worked for years in television, including as a director of NBC’s “Today” show.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/theater/17arts-COUPLEHONORE_BRF.html

Still, it was not as severe as the center predicted last year, based on the sharp loss in the value of foundation assets. Some foundations pared expenses and reduced staffs. The Ford Foundation, for example, found $40 million in cost savings that it used for grants. Ford and other foundations also increased the portion of assets they gave away in hopes of ameliorating problems caused by the poor economy. While assets at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation declined about 20 percent, the foundation increased the amount it paid out to 7 percent of the lower value of its assets, around $3.8 billion.

Gilhart, it turns out, is also one of the headliners for Christie’s’ first ever “green” auction, A Bid to Save the Earth, and NBC has signed on as a media sponsor. The live auction on April 22, which benefits the N.R.D.C., the Central Park Conservancy, Oceana and Conservation International, includes such fashionable prizes as lunch with Vera Wang — plus a $10,000 shopping spree at her flagship store — and a fitting with Stella McCartney for bespoke his and hers suits.

Transworld said the book, which will be called “The Woman I Was Born to Be,” will document Ms. Boyle’s sudden rise after her 2009 appearance on “Britain’s Got Talent,” which led to her best-selling debut album, “I Dreamed a Dream.” A British release is planned for the fall; no American publication date has been announced. In a statement reported by the BBC, Ms. Boyle said she was “writing this book to try to show that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.” She added: “When I strutted on to the stage for that audition, I was a scared wee lassie, still grieving for my mother, not caring how I looked. I think I’ve grown up a lot in the last year, become more of a lady, and I’m not so frightened anymore.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/arts/21arts-SUSANBOYLESS_BRF.html

There’s nothing like 25,000 square miles of Mojave wasteland to put things in perspective. But in those arid badlands of Southern California, accommodations — when you can find them — tend to be either motel-dismal or perfunctorily kitschy. Except for these two recent discoveries. Sacred Sands is a wisp of high-desert chic just one mile from the west entrance to Joshua Tree National Park. Here, at the base of a rocky ridge, Steve Pratt and Scott Cutler have fashioned a luxe eco-friendly retreat that’s unapologetically open to the barrens. It has just two suites ($269 and $299 a night) — though two more are in the works — both with wraparound terraces. Each has an outdoor hot tub spiked with Dead Sea salts and tea tree oil along with a meditation platform, essentially a full-size bed where guests can sleep al fresco. And many do: “For city dwellers, it might be a little frightening at first,” Cutler says, “but most people who doze off under the stars say it’s the best sleep they’ve ever had.” In the morning, fresh chilaquiles with homemade mole sauce, oven-baked pancakes and yam hash give incentive to rise.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/now-booking-boutique-hotels-in-joshua-tree/

2010-04-22,Style Icon | Grace Kelly,"For anyone raised on Madonna or Rihanna, it’s hard to fathom how a rich girl with a wardrobe full of shirtdresses, twin sets and pearls  and a firm disbeliever in women wearing trousers  could become the fashion idol of her generation. But Grace Kelly epitomized a time before rebellion was a virtue, and the forthcoming “Grace Kelly: Style Icon” exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London pays homage to the actress-turned-princess’s sartorial legacy, from her rise to stardom in the ’50s to her untimely death in 1982. “She certainly didn’t see herself as a style leader, liking such conservative clothes,” says the show¹s curator, Jenny Lister. “But audiences loved her kind of uncontrived, natural beauty.” Highlights of the show include Kelly’s namesake Hermès bag, dresses from her films “High Society” and “Rear Window,” and items from among the 80 pieces of luggage she carried to Monaco for her wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956. But perhaps more intriguing is what happened in the decades that followed, when Kelly found herself outside her comfort zone  amid all the tiaras and Dior ballgowns are the odd nods to rising hemlines and changing times, like her YSL Mondrian dress. In the end though, says Lister, “she was always happier in a Chanel suit.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/style-icon-grace-kelly/

Regis Philbin, above center, is a frequent guest on Mr. Letterman’s “Late Show” on CBS, and Mr. Letterman has often expressed affection and admiration for him. (Mr. Letterman was last a guest on “Live” in April 2007, when Mr. Philbin returned to the show after heart surgery.) This visit helps kick off a big effort by “Live” during the next ratings sweeps period, which begins next Thursday.

The group, Revolution Muslim, published its post after a “South Park” episode last week that depicted the founders of various religions, including Moses, Jesus and Buddha, but declined to show the Prophet Muhammad, instead representing him as wearing a bear costume. The post, written by Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, said that the episode had “outright insulted” Muhammad, adding: “We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid, and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them.” Mr. van Gogh was killed in Amsterdam after making a film that discussed the abuse of Muslim women in some Islamic societies. A telephone message left at a number listed on the group’s Web site, revolutionmuslim.com, was not immediately returned; on Wednesday the Web site was largely inaccessible.

The Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan said a rare manuscript of the Magna Carta that it started showing on Wednesday would remain on display through May 30 while arrangements were made to transport it home to Britain. The original Magna Carta was sealed by King John of England in 1215 at Runnymede, putting limits on the king’s power and laying the groundwork for legal principles like the writ of habeas corpus. The version at the Morgan, which comes from the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, dates to 1217 and is one of 17 surviving originals produced in the 13th century that bear the royal seal. Richard Ovenden, the Bodleian’s associate director and keeper of special collections, said this Magna Carta made its first visit to New York for a special event for Oxford alumni in the United States held on Saturday at the Waldorf-Astoria. As the ash from the eruption of an Icelandic volcano disrupted air travel, Mr. Ovenden said, transportation for the document became more perilous, and airlines, concerned with getting people home, were reluctant to carry it.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/arts/design/22arts-FORTHEMAGNAC_BRF.html

2010-04-22,Miracle Worker,"The fountain of youth is legendary in myth and history; some scientists and skin-care experts think it still exists, thanks to an enzyme called telomerase. Dr. Gregory Bays Brown of RéVive has created a $1,500 skin cream, Peau Magnifique, containing telomerase. In fact, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered how chromosomes are protected by the enzyme, and further research could prove telomerase to be a key factor in infinite cell proliferation. No one’s promising the death of funerals yet, but hope springs eternal. Here’s the CliffsNote: As cells divide, they send copies of themselves to new cells. But that copying process chops off bits of the originals’ protective tips. As we age, the tips, known as telomeres, get shorter and shorter till the original cells die, and we do too. Cancer cells, stem cells and some rogue cells produce a substance that blocks the snipping process — telomerase. How it can be deconstructed, harnessed and activated remains to be seen: lab-made telomerase would have to penetrate skin, pass through tissue and cell walls, and hook into chromosomal activity in order to be effective. But RéVive’s Brown claims that telomerase can recruit the skin’s resting stem cells — which exist in case of injury — to manufacture new skin. So far, there are no major peer-review studies or clinical trials. And animal testing isn’t possible since only humans produce it. Nevertheless, the party has definitely begun; in addition to RéVive, Jan Marini’s Age Intervention Regeneration Booster and Goldfaden’s DNA Telomere Cream boast telomere science. Other beauty products are sure to follow. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/miracle-worker/

Monitoring a cap system would be an administrative nightmare, evoking even more anger over big-government intervention in our lives. Despite the political antipathy, carbon taxes levied at the primary energy-source level make more operational sense. Aetna Professor Emeritus, John F.

The list also includes the much-garlanded Hilary Mantel, for “Wolf Hall,” which has already won the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Rounding out the list of finalists are the British writer Rosie Alison, for “The Very Thought of You,” and Monique Roffey, who was born in Trinidad, for “The White Woman on the Green Bicycle.” The winner will be announced on June 9 in London. The prize comes with a check for about $46,000 and a bronze statue called a Bessie.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/books/23arts-3AMERICANWRI_BRF.html
2010-04-23,"After ‘Office’ Hours, Mindy Kaling Writes","On “The Office” the bubbly Kelly Kapoor does not seem able to write much more than her name (with smiley faces in the o’s). In real life Mindy Kaling, left, the actress and writer who portrays her on that NBC comedy, is much more prolific. Her work as an author includes the play “Matt & Ben” (written with Brenda Withers), many episodes of “The Office” and a prodigious amount of blog posts and tweets. And soon a book. The Crown Publishing Group said on Thursday that it had acquired a book from Ms. Kaling called “The Contents of My Purse,” planned for a fall 2011 release. The publisher described it as a cross between “Love, Loss and What I Wore” and Ms. Kaling’s blog, “Things I’ve Bought That I Love” (mindyephron.blogspot.com). But in a telephone interview Ms. Kaling indicated that she might have other plans. “What they bought was a funny book of comedy essays,” she said, “but maybe I’ll just turn it into a Jon Krakauer piece about murder in Siberia and perilous adventure to find details about that. I don’t want to be boxed in.” Assuming she sticks to the original plan, Ms. Kaling said the book would probably be “stories about my life and my opinions.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/television/23arts-AFTEROFFICEH_BRF.html
2010-04-23,Gallery Owner Says Artist Has a Blacklist,"Naming names is a rare thing in the highly private business of selling art, but a Manhattan gallery owner did so in federal court in Manhattan this week, testifying that a prominent contemporary painter maintains a blacklist of art collectors and dealers whom she punishes for reselling her works, the Web site artinfo.com reported Wednesday. The gallery owner, Jack Tilton, testified that Marlene Dumas, a South African-born artist whose work is sought by important collectors and whom he represented for many years, has long kept a list that prevents those she views as turning over her works too quickly from buying more by her. Mr. Tilton  who testified as the result of a subpoena by a Miami collector, Craig Robins, the plaintiff in a lawsuit related to the list  said that besides Mr. Robins, other well-known collectors and dealers like Richard Cooper and Daniel Holtz were on the list. In his suit Mr. Robins says that he sold a painting by Ms. Dumas through the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea in 2004 with an agreement that the sale remain confidential. But the Zwirner gallery, which took over representation of Ms. Dumas in 2008, told her about it, Mr. Robins asserts, causing her to add his name to the blacklist, according to his suit. The suit says that Mr. Zwirner promised to help get Mr. Robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from “Against the Wall,” the current show of Ms. Dumas’s work at Zwirner, but that this did not happen. Mr. Zwirner  who was also on Ms. Dumas’s blacklist at one point, Mr. Tilton said  denies both assertions. Ms. Dumas has declined to comment on the suit.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/design/23arts-GALLERYOWNER_BRF.html

A popular entertainment, stripping was  or so the theater owner Herbert Minsky insisted  an American art.

Critics say the practice clogs the courts and turns corporate lists of debtors into free-fire zones that sometimes target the innocent. In the Bay Area, a loose-knit group of public-interest lawyers pools resources to fight what they see as a misuse of the court system. “We found that these law firms count on a huge percentage of the people that they sue defaulting,” or not responding to the legal actions, said Osha Neumann, a lawyer with the East Bay Community Law Center. “That’s how the debt buyers make their money.”",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/can-debt-collectors-overuse-the-courts-and-more-in-fridays-bay-area-report/
2010-04-23,Rainer Ganahl: ‘Language of Emigration & Pictures of Emigration’,"The latest exhibition from the veteran Conceptual artist Rainer Ganahl is a resonant feat of site-specificity, a fit of art and space so unforced yet so affecting as to be breathtaking. Basically Mr. Ganahl has used nearly every square foot of the fledgling Alex Zachary gallery, an empty brownstone garden duplex of 1980s rehab. (It is located on without being quite of the Upper East Side. It keeps Thursday-to-Sunday Lower East Side hours, and Mr. Zachary still has his day job at Gavin Brown’s gallery in the West Village.)

2010-04-23,William Scott," There are obvious criticisms to be made of the canvases of the British painter William Scott (1913-1989), which are having their first solo in New York since 1992. His art can be seen as sentimental and timid, as abstract paintings for people who don’t like abstraction. But what remains is some wonderfully solid, serenely formal images that refuse to banish reality. Their fusion of the mundane and exalted remains vibrant and may be especially useful at the moment, with so many painters exploring new ways of balancing meaning and form.

(The show was organized by the peripatetic Dahesh Museum of Art, which is still seeking a home of its own.) The academy required three years of drawing, followed by painting under a recognized master’s tutelage and, finally, winning the Prix de Rome. There is more to learn about the process from this compact show, but the main attraction is in the surprising number of mostly small, beautifully made paintings and drawings on display.

He didn’t even use foundation on the model’s skin. “After all, great skin is the ultimate luxury,” he says. But bare doesn’t mean you don’t use any makeup at all, he stresses. “When you pare it down to such an extent, every element you do wear has to be perfect — the perfect lipstick, the perfect eyeliner, the perfect nail polish.” For Philips, the new bare lies somewhere between the overdone maquillage of the late ’80s and the raw, unkempt look of the early ’90s. “I don’t think women today feel the need to be so extreme,” he says. Working on the shoot, Philips found the contradictions inherent in creating deconstructed beauty images to be both intriguing and modern. “The iconic, formal poses in the photos are a reference to old fashion photography, and are completely at odds with how we played with the pristine, expensive objects in the shots,” he says. (It’s true that a lot of women might shudder at the idea of drawing on a quilted Chanel bag with eyeliner.) “I love the fact that you can never see the model’s eyes,” Philips continues. “Makeup can be a mask that a woman hides behind. I compare it to a woman who overaccessorizes or wears over-the-top fashion — the accessories and clothes almost act as armor.” Whether a woman decides to get away with a mere swipe of mascara or puts on a full face, Philips supports the idea that less can truly be more: “You can wear the most dramatic red lipstick, but if you wear it with confidence, as if you own it, it will look completely natural.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/surreal-reveal/

A 5-foot-1 vocal powerhouse who has been nicknamed the Queen of Funk, Ms. Jones, 53, grew up singing at home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in church and in local bands. But professional success in music eluded her; for a time she worked as a prison guard at Rikers Island, where the inmates would sometimes make requests. Now, as the leader of the Dap-Kings, the house band of the Brooklyn record label Daptone, Ms. Jones is the epitome of the soul revival. “I Learned the Hard Way,” the fourth album by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, which entered the Billboard album chart at No. 15 this month, earned praise for staying true to the analog grit of its predecessors. Ms. Jones still lives with her mother in a public housing in Far Rockaway, Queens, a rough area she escapes by going fishing in the Delaware Water Gap. In an interview in the waiting room of her ear, nose and throat doctor  Ms. Jones needed a checkup before a European tour  she and Neal Sugarman, a Dap-King saxophonist and a founder of Daptone, talked about the musicians they draw inspiration from, like Otis Redding and Etta James, and their recently upgraded life on tour. After years of buying her own vintage dresses, Ms. Jones now has a stage wardrobe that comes courtesy of the designers Trina Turk and Minna. And the shoes she dances up a storm in? “Payless,” she stage-whispered. “Don’t tell anyone.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/arts/music/25sharon.html

The Treasury secretary is bedeviled over what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bailed-out mortgage giants that have cost the taxpayers upward of $125 billion with as yet no end in sight. Shutting them down is not so easy because — get ready for this — since their bailout, in September 2008, Fannie and Freddie have become more, not less, important to the U.S. housing market. At present, 9 of every 10 new mortgages are sold to, or guaranteed by, arms of the U.S. government, the majority of them to Fannie and Freddie. Which is to say, without Uncle Sam, it is not clear that the private market for housing would even exist. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25fob-wwln-t.html

2010-04-26,Green Day Surprises Broadway Audience,"The Broadway show “American Idiot” turned into a rock concert with a supercharged encore on Thursday night: a surprise appearance by Green Day, the band that wrote the music. The three-man band, and an additional guitarist, took to the stage after the show as audience members screamed. “This is my first night on Broadway,” the singer-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, right, declared, then blared out the opening power chords of “American Idiot,” the show’s title song. The cast was onstage, pogoing and singing along. One cast member tried crowd-surfing, traveling about three rows. Mr. Armstrong jumped around, stuck out his tongue and filled in the part of rock ’n’ roll that’s absent from the Broadway show: audience participation, with singalongs of “Heys” and “Day-Os” from “The Banana Boat Song.” The drummer, Tré Cool, flung his drum sticks into the audience, as if the set were over. But it wasn’t. Green Day went on to play an older song, “Basket Case,” which isn’t part of the show. Audience members squealed anew and shouted the lyrics when the bassist Mike Dirnt pointed a microphone their way. Cast members knew them, too, cementing some punk-rock credentials. Afterward, a few of them lifted the grinning Mr. Armstrong off his feet.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/theater/24arts-GREENDAYSURP_BRF.html

Primary Stages said that it would end its season with two stage readings of “Godfather IV,” an original work by Tom Fontana, the “Oz” creator. It will star Christopher Meloni, Lee Tergesen and Dean Winters, who all appeared on that eye-gougingly violent series. “Godfather IV” is not a sequel to Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia movies, but a piece in which the “Oz” actors discuss the plausibility of a key scene in “The Godfather,” and Mr. Tergesen and Mr. Winters resolve to put a horse’s head in Mr. Meloni’s bed. The readings, scheduled for May 2 at 59E59 Theaters, are being presented as a benefit for Primary Stages and the Writers Guild of America, East Foundation. They will be directed by Linda Laundra (“Homicide: Life on the Street”) and will also feature the “Oz” alumni Mike Doyle, Zeljko Ivanek, Terry Kinney, David Laundra, Kristin Rohde, Eamonn Walker and Catherine Wolf, as well as an appearance by Mr. Fontana.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/theater/24arts-ESCAPETOTHEA_BRF.html

Kevin will be introduced in Veronica No. 202, right, in a story titled, “Isn’t it Bromantic?” The inclusion of the character meets twin goals, one real world and one in-story. “Riverdale has to reflect the diversity of the world today,” said Jon Goldwater, co-chief executive of Archie Comic Publications. “We want to be all inclusive.” Mr. Goldwater also said he’s not afraid of any repercussions. “We think everyone is going to enjoy the story,” he said. “It’s completely in the tradition of your typical Archie comic.” Dan Parent will be writing and illustrating the story of Kevin’s introduction. He said his goal was simple: “Veronica is always chasing guys and getting what she wants. Who could we introduce that she could not get?” Mr. Parent said Kevin would be more than a one-off character with future stories already mapped out.

It is one of a handful of commercial plays this season that have recouped the investment spent on mounting the productions on Broadway. All of those plays had star performers in lead roles, a common box office strategy nowadays. “Race” stars James Spader (“Boston Legal”) as a lawyer who spars with two colleagues, played by David Alan Grier and Kerry Washington, about defending a white man facing ugly criminal accusations from a black woman. Other star-driven plays that recouped this season are “A Steady Rain” (with Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig) and the revivals of “Hamlet” (Jude Law) and “A View From the Bridge” (Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Johansson). Directed by Mr. Mamet, “Race” opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Dec. 6, and is scheduled to run through June 13.

(CBS Films, which aggressively interpreted its film’s opening as “very solid,” hopes a shortage of female-oriented pictures will eventually turn the heavily marketed “Back-Up Plan” into a winner.) The $25 million thriller “The Losers” became the latest in a string of flops from Joel Silver’s Dark Castle Entertainment with about $9.6 million, putting it in fourth place. The No. 1 film was a holdover: DreamWorks Animation’s “How to Train Your Dragon,” with positive word of mouth and premium-priced 3-D tickets, brought in about $15 million and a new total of $178 million. The comedy “Date Night” from 20th Century Fox chugged away in third place with about $10.6 million ($63.5 million total). The violent superhero comedy “Kick-Ass,” No. 1 last weekend, sunk to fifth place with $9.5 million ($34.9 million total).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/movies/26arts-DRAGONBACKIN_BRF.html

2010-04-26,‘God of Carnage’ to Close,"After more than 400 performances and three different casts, Yasmina Reza’s “God of Carnage” will close on Broadway on June 27, the producers announced. In a statement they said they were “incredibly proud and thrilled with the success” of the show but had decided to end the run with the completion of the current cast’s contracts. “Carnage,” a comedy about two couples who fight over an altercation between their sons, opened in March 2009 at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater with Jeff Daniels, Hope Davis, James Gandolfini and Marcia Gay Harden. It went on to win the 2009 Tony award for best play, as well as a best actress award for Ms. Harden and best director for Matthew Warchus. At the time it was one of the highest-grossing plays on Broadway. In November a second cast  Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott  took over; then a third cast, with Janet McTeer, Lucy Liu, Mr. Daniels in a different role, and Dylan Baker, opened in March. The show continued to gain critical acclaim with each new cast, but it failed to sustain its original commercial success. Also, recent talks of a national tour ended after producers found that not enough theaters in major cities would be available for booking.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/theater/26arts-GODOFCARNAGE_BRF.html

2010-04-26,The Wheel Thing,"Laugh all you want, but the name ‘‘Design Within Reach’’ was never meant to be about affordability. When Rob Forbes founded the high-end modern furniture retailer in 1999, he was throwing open the doors to a realm that was — at least in this country — maddeningly difficult for the average civilian to penetrate without the help of an interior designer. With his new company, Public, he’s taking the pain out of acquiring another elusive design object: the stylish, practical city bike, the kind that the Dutch and Danish ride. A longtime urban cyclist himself, Forbes watched as places like New York, San Francisco and even Louisville, Ky., spent the last decade opening bike lanes and encouraging alternative transportation, and yet, he argues, most American bike stores still cater primarily to athletes. ‘‘Bicycle technology here is centered on lightweight performance, so they’re not as interested in a customer that wants a kickstand, rack and fenders,’’ he says. The Public M (left) is a lightweight update on classic French models from the ’60s and ’70s, à la ‘‘Jules et Jim.’’ And at $600 to $1,200, Public’s bikes are more or less within reach. Forbes still believes in living a well-designed life, but this time around he’s taking his gospel to the streets.

2010-04-27,A Morphing Mural,"Shepard Fairey’s latest street-art piece, a freshly installed mural on Houston Street near the Bowery in Lower Manhattan, includes Mr. Fairey’s signature Andre the Giant, Communist propaganda-tinged images and, perhaps presciently, a target. Hours after the mural went up last week, the graffiti writer known as NAW added his tag to it; a security guard tried to apprehend NAW, but he escaped, apparently by wriggling out of his shirt, according to the blogger Bucky Turco. The tag was quickly removed. More recently, someone punctured the piece, perhaps with a rock or a brick, leaving several small holes and a gaping one through which a previous mural, by the twins known as Os Gemeos, is visible. The piece is a prelude to Mr. Fairey’s exhibition at Deitch Projects, the gallery’s final show before it closes. Andrea Cashman, a spokeswoman for Deitch, said the puncture and tagging were “a natural occurrence” for any large outdoor project. She said that members of Mr. Fairey’s team would be filling the punctures soon. Mr. Fairey said in a telephone interview that he hadn’t seen the damage, but that if critics wanted to express themselves by vandalizing the mural, “that’s fair.” He added, “I assume that they think that putting a bullet hole through it is a clever interactive addition, which I actually agree with.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/arts/design/27arts-AMORPHINGMUR_BRF.html

Filmmaker,"A documentary filmmaker says he will fight a request by Chevron to turn over hundreds of hours of footage he shot for a documentary about pollution in the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. Chevron says the material may be useful in lawsuits accusing it of damaging the environment there. The filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, whose documentaries include “Paradise Lost” and “Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,” said he had been served with a request from Chevron for more than 600 hours of unused footage for his 2009 documentary “Crude.” The movie, seen in a scene above, chronicles Ecuadoreans who sued Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron, saying the companies’ practices at the Lago Agrio oil field resulted in the contamination of their drinking and bathing water. Mr. Berlinger, who is scheduled to appear in United States District Court in Manhattan on Friday, said Chevron’s request violated his First Amendment rights. If Chevron obtained his footage, he said, “It would have a serious chilling effect on these kinds of investigative films.” Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer representing Chevron, said the company “simply seeks here outtakes relating to the access this filmmaker was given to film the plaintiffs and their lawyers, government officials and supposedly independent experts’ meetings with the plaintiffs and their lawyers.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/arts/27arts-CHEVRONVSFIL_BRF.html

In November an appearance by Mr. Bieber at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y., resulted in a fan stampede after which the singer’s manager, Scott Braun, was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and criminal nuisance.

2010-04-27,Alphabet Chic,"In their nearly 20 years together, the graphic artists Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak — who go by the name M/M (Paris) — have designed more than 50 typefaces, from an alphabet built from the sliced-up photographs of 26 male models to the inky resin letter forms that spell out ‘‘Medulla’’ on the cover of Bjork’s 2004 album. Their latest, the Pradalphabet (above), was originally conceived as a temporary five-letter logotype for the house of Miuccia: Prada-M. (The M stands for Milano and M/M.) But the duo’s ideographic tendencies got the best of them, and in the end, M/M designed a whole alphabet of ornamented initials, each representing a hazy portrait of the Prada brand. ‘‘It’s like looking at a planet from afar,’’ says Augustyniak, who along with Amzalag spent up to six hours hand-drawing each letter. ‘‘You can see a continent, but it’s impossible to say what’s inside.’’ Examine the letters closely, however, and you’ll spot cleaning implements, Italian phrases, strange machines and a picture of two men standing on a balcony. (‘‘They’re inhabitants of the Prada world,’’ Amzalag says.) For now, they live in a collector’s edition of T-shirts, each silk-screened with a P, R, A, D or M and packaged in a cloth-bound box with a 64-page album describing the project. Other letters are available on demand at Prada stores worldwide. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/alphabet-chic/

During the run, which opened on Nov. 22 and closed on Monday, 810,500 visitors came to see artifacts like Mr. Burton’s early illustrations and a prop of Sarah Jessica Parker’s severed head from his movie “Mars Attacks!” Mr. Burton is now in the rarefied company of Picasso, whose 1980 retrospective at MoMA remains the museum’s all-time most popular (with 976,800 visitors), and Matisse, whose 1992 retrospective remains runner-up (with 940,000).

The video, made for the first single of M.I.A.’s coming album and directed by Romain Gavras, the son of Costa-Gavras, depicts an unspecified military force, with some members wearing American flags on their uniforms, rounding up redheaded men from an apartment complex and taking them to a desert to be tortured and executed. In its community guidelines, YouTube says videos can be taken down from the site for violations like excessive violence, and can be flagged if users believe the videos violate these guidelines. YouTube declined to say if any versions of the M.I.A. video were taken down due to its violent content.

2010-04-28,A Soap Opera Sells Its Scenery,"Soap opera fans will have a chance to own pieces of broadcasting history when the props of a long-lived and recently canceled television serial are sold at an auction on Saturday. The catch is that Procter & Gamble won’t give permission for the name of the soap opera to be used in the promotion of the auction. But here’s some guidance: the show was the longest-running scripted program in broadcasting history before CBS ran its final episode in September. Castners Auction & Appraisal Service will sell hundreds of items from  uh, that show  on Saturday at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The inventory is being sold by Props NYC, which is owned by Nicole Stiegelbauer. Her family’s scenery company, Stiegelbauer Associates, built sets for shows like “As the World Turns” and a certain other soap opera before the shows were canceled. “When you clean out a soundstage for a show that’s been in existence for 20, 30, 40 years, it’s levels upon levels of history that just all of a sudden unravel,” Ms. Stiegelbauer said. “You’re like, ‘What does one do?’ ” In this case the items will be gathered by the truckload at Building 10 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; a preview will begin at 9 a.m. on Saturday with the sale starting at 11 a.m.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/arts/television/28arts-ASOAPOPERASE_BRF.html
2010-04-28,‘Squeakquel’ Breeds a Chipmunks Lawsuit,"In more innocent days, when Alvin and the Chipmunks needed an authority figure to get something done, they turned to a witch doctor. Now they go to their lawyers. The Hollywood Reporter said that the production company behind the Chipmunk characters and a relative of their creator are suing 20th Century Fox, saying that studio owes them half of the profits from last year’s hit film “Alvin & the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.” The lawsuit was filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles by Bagdasarian Productions and the writer Janice Karman, whose father-in-law, Ross Bagdasarian Sr., created the Chipmunks and originally provided the voice of their human caretaker, David Seville. The suit says Ms. Karman wrote a script for an “Alvin & the Chipmunks” sequel after the original 2007 film grossed more than $361 million worldwide, and though she never reached a deal with Fox on her compensation, she provided additional revisions after two other writers were hired to polish what Ms. Karman says was her draft. The plaintiffs say they are co-owners of the script to the “Squeakquel,” which grossed more than $442 million worldwide, and that Fox also breached a producers’ agreement. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Fox said the claims were “completely without merit.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/movies/28arts-SQUEAKQUELBR_BRF.html

2010-04-28,What a Dish,"Rudolf Stingel has a lot on his plate these days — literally. The New York-based conceptual artist collaborated with Bernardaud, the French porcelain company, and the Art Production Fund’s WOW (Works on Whatever) on a pair of luscious-looking dinner plates that are almost too beautiful to mar with a meal. The plates, which come in an edition of 2,500 in both black and white, are based on photographs of a wall relief that Stingel began in 2008. Fittingly, that project was inspired by the wallpaper in the dining room of his childhood home. Why make tableware? ‘‘I like to eat,’’ the artist says. ‘‘And I like to look at my work — two birds, one stone.’’ It’s not the artist’s first excursion into the everyday. In 2004, he famously swathed Grand Central Station’s cavernous Vanderbilt Hall in floral carpeting. Impressive, of course. But this is one project he’ll be able to dine out on for years. And at $98 each, so will you. Available at worksonwhatever.com and Bernardaud boutiques in New York and Chicago. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/what-a-dish/

That’s the question the curators at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum wrestled with for nearly three years as they assembled ‘‘Why Design Now?,’’ the museum’s fourth National Design Triennial, which opens May 14. Their response, presented through 134 projects from around the world, might be the design equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. Many are high-minded, utilitarian responses to critical problems overseas (cleaner-burning stoves, a land-mine-removal suit) and at home (New York City’s new Hoop bike rack, M.I.T.’s prototype for a lightweight electric city car). ‘‘There’s room for high-style design, but there also needs to be room for the rest of the world,’’ says Matilda McQuaid, the museum’s deputy curatorial director. But its definition of socially responsible has room for whimsical conceptualism (Interactive Institute’s Energy Aware Clock, above), architectural grandiosity (Foster & Partners’ sustainable city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi) and simple beauty (Heath Ceramics tableware). Even Twitter made the cut. ‘‘People say the focus on socially responsible design is just because of the Wall Street crisis and isn’t going to survive once things are back to normal,’’ McQuaid says. ‘‘I think it’s here to stay.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/do-good-design/

2010-04-28,High Gloss," If you are strong enough not to be moved by dolphin console tables and rococo plasterwork, Syrie Maugham is probably nothing more to you than the wife of the sulfurous literary lion W. Somerset Maugham. For the rest of us, it’s a different story. A domestic-arts arbiter of adventurous originality, Syrie set up shop in London in 1922 and went on to forge a triumphantly theatrical look celebrating glamour and luxury. Some of her ideas were odd, some immensely profitable. She said that by stripping peonies of their leaves, party guests could be fooled into believing they were wax, a look she preferred to fresh. Indifferent antiques were ruthlessly cut down, painted, pickled or otherwise “improved” until they sang arias of sustained chic. Were dealers already referring to “amusing” pieces — furniture with little intrinsic worth but a surfeit of charm — before Syrie Maugham came on the scene? I suspect it all began with her. As it happens, we’re on the verge of a Syrie fest. Two forthcoming books, Selina Hastings’s “The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham” (Random House) and Pauline C. Metcalf’s “Syrie Maugham: Staging the Glamorous Interior” (Acanthus Press), make the point that no pedestal was too high for the woman who popularized the “all-white room,” an icily moderne cocktail of mirrored screens and fireplaces, geometrically sculptured carpets, shagreen tables, satin slipcovers, towering plaster lamps in the form of palm trees and velvet — velvet! — lampshades. You would have thought that with two books already out there — “Syrie Maugham,” a rare 1978 monograph, and 1980’s “The Scandal of Syrie Maugham” — to say nothing of Beverley Nichols’s 1966 screed “A Case of Human Bondage,” which was dedicated entirely to her toxic marriage, there was nothing left to say or dig up. Happily, this is not the case. Too much is never enough for Syrie cultists.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/t-magazine/02talk-maugham-t.html

This year’s highlights include Carlo van de Roer’s ethereal Polaroid portraits, James Reeve’s nocturnal cityscapes, and Yann Gross’s Ugandan skateboarder series. Hyères 2010 will also feature a Walter Pfeiffer retrospective and a new video by Steven Klein depicting his fashion photography from the past ten years. Klein’s highly structured, subversive images are a good counterbalance to Pfeiffer’s more jocular, candid photos.

Courtney Hodell, an editor at the publishing house, said Monroe’s writing covered a wide range of subjects, including notes on the roles she was working on, exhortations to herself to become a better actress and lists of resolutions on how to do so, notes from her readings about Italian Renaissance art and how to decorate her apartment, and a recipe for stuffing. There are also diary-style entries on Monroe’s relationship with Arthur Miller, as well as letters to her psychoanalysts and to Lee Strasberg, her friend and acting instructor, written when she was in the locked psychiatric ward of the Payne Whitney Clinic in New York. “She’s trying to live the life of an artist and suffering a lot,” Ms. Hodell said in a telephone interview. The letters in the book, Ms. Hodell added, were part of the estate that Strasberg inherited after Monroe’s death in August 1962. The letters were given by his widow, Anna Strasberg, to Stanley Buchthal, a family friend and adviser, and Bernard Comment, an editor at the publisher Éditions du Seuil in Paris, to be compiled and edited for “Fragments.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/books/29arts-THEREALMARIL_BRF.html

Now it appears that fans have stirred a slumbering giant within the diminutive figure of Justin Bieber, the 16-year-old pop star. Mr. Bieber admonished his followers on Wednesday morning after Auckland Airport in New Zealand was overrun with excited young fans, above, because of his arrival, BBC News reported. On his Twitter feed Mr. Bieber wrote: “The airport was crazy. Not happy that someone stole my hat and knocked down my mama. Come on people.” He continued in a second tweet: “I want to be able to sign and take pics and meet my fans, but if you are all pushing security wont let me. let’s keep it safe and have fun.” An Auckland Airport spokesman had said it was increasing security in anticipation of Mr. Bieber’s visit and keeping his arrival time secret, though it apparently did not stay secret for long. This incident follows the cancellation of a free outdoor show that Mr. Bieber was to perform in Sydney, Australia, where more than 4,000 fans were pushing and shoving one another.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/arts/music/29arts-CHAOSCONTINU_BRF.html

Three of New York’s most prominent play producers began trying to raise $2.5 million to move the show, even though its length (nine hours, broken into three parts) and lack of star performers made it an iffy investment for commercial Broadway. But the producers thought the show, the final opus of the acclaimed writer Horton Foote, had a good shot at Tony Awards  which go only to Broadway productions  and they believed that a wide audience would want to see the work, given the huge demand for tickets at its 160-seat Off Broadway house.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/theater/02stages.html

2010-04-29,Financial Reform and the Perils of the Center,"In the debate over financial reform, the Senate G.O.P. seems to be proceeding the way Democrats and a large swathe of the chattering class wanted them to proceed on health care reform. For most of the way, they’ve been the party of “yes, if …” rather than the party of no, using the limited powers of the minority to ease the bill in their direction, rather than trying to defeat it outright. As a result, it seems likely that “FinReg” will pass with more than a few G.O.P. votes, having been amended in ways that address at least some conservative concerns. You can chalk this compromise up to pure political self-interest — financial reform is much more popular than health care reform and everybody knows it — or to the fact that the ideological stakes are lower on these issues than they were on health care. But either way, the Republicans have behaved extremely “responsibly” on the issue, at least as the Beltway consensus defines “responsible.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/financial-reform-and-the-perils-of-the-center/

And for a sum that could probably pay for the restoration of more than a few bumpy British roads, Lennon’s original handwritten lyrics for his part of “A Day in the Life” could be yours: Reuters reported that at an auction on June 18 Sotheby’s would sell the single sheet of paper on which  Lennon composed his verses, starting with the famous line, “I read the news today, oh boy.” ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/oh-boy-lennons-lyrics-for-a-day-in-the-life-for-sale/

2010-04-30,A Canal Zone Comes Into Its Own,"The Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, the city’s latest industrial desert turned cultural outpost, makes for a pleasant afternoon’s wander. The namesake canal, while it holds tons of poisonous stuff, is serene and calming. Things still do get a little post-apocalyptic: the weird drone of a cement factory, wide empty streets dotted with used condoms, a lone cormorant perched on the bank of a Superfund site. But with its historic bridges, canoeing club, low-slung buildings and growing selection of restaurants (Ethiopian, anyone?), Gowanus is laid-back and friendly. And markedly accessible: Jump off the B, D, M, N, Q, R, 2, 3, 4 or 5 trains at the Atlantic/Pacific station and head down Fourth Avenue from the Williamsburgh Savings Bank tower to start your day in big-sky country.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/a-canal-zone-comes-into-its-own/

The first audience certainly found it dour after the excitement and exoticism of his ballets.

Jackson was the best-selling artist over all, with 22.9 million album sales around the world; five of his titles are in the Top 20.

The motion contends that Mr. Gunson’s testimony would prove that an extradition request filed with Switzerland last year included a false depiction of the sentencing plan by Judge Laurence J. Rittenband. The request said that Judge Rittenband sent Mr. Polanski to prison in 1977 for a psychiatric study so he would “be in a better position to reach a fair and just decision” before sentencing, while Mr. Gunson, according to Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, has testified that Mr. Polanski’s prison stay was to constitute his entire sentence. Prosecutors have argued in court that the extradition request was an accurate portrayal of events. Mr. Polanski’s lawyers said that Swiss officials needed access to the sealed transcripts to fairly determine whether Mr. Polanski should be sent back to the United States, which he fled in 1978 before sentencing for having sex with a minor. A hearing on the motion was set for May 10.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/movies/30arts-POLANSKILAWY_BRF.html

Buildings stand empty. The few people on the property are involved in the continuing cleanup or are among the sculptors, painters and photographers who created an improbable artists’ colony in some of the shipyard buildings. But a crucial decision is facing the Board of Supervisors in a few weeks. It will open — or close — the door to the Lennar Corporation’s $7 billion redevelopment plan for the 770-acre site, one that would include 10,500 homes, large amounts of retail and commercial space and even new accommodations for the artists’ colony. The development project is headed by Kofi Bonner, a vice president at Lennar who spearheaded the redevelopment of Emeryville, which, like Hunter’s Point, was plagued by toxic waste. Mr. Bonner served as San Francisco’s economic development director under Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. during the 1990s.Wine on Tap | At Frances, the restaurant in San Francisco’s Castro neighborhood getting all the buzz these days, customers pay by the ounce for the wine they drink.

We knew his dad, Mustafa, who was our next-door neighbor, but we had never met Mehmet, then away at school. This whirlwind climbed in through our breakfast-room window, was charmingly chatty and challenged my husband, then in his late 30s, to “a little hoops” in our driveway. While mopping up the driveway with my husband, Mehmet mentioned that he was in University of Pennsylvania medical school and getting an M.B.A. from Wharton at the same time. When my husband said that seemed pretty ambitious, Mehmet just brushed that off, saying that his dad said that to practice medicine today, you have to have an M.B.A. Sounds like he hasn’t changed much — he’s not just a world-beater, he’s becoming a world-changer.JEAN KENNEDY HUNTERHouston",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02letters-t-DRDOESITALL_LETTERS.html

I was an assistant to Cornell Capa for 35 years, and what Cornell clearly meant in his statement was his surprise that Vishniac’s work, as important as it was, was not more widely known prior to his own efforts after 1966. For McGovern to go on to say that Capa (either Robert or Cornell, take your pick) had a “similar impulse to encourage the viewers to believe things that weren’t really there” is a gross misinterpretation of the facts, and unfair conjecture.ANNA WINANDNew York",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02letters-t-ACLOSERREADI_LETTERS.html

2010-04-30,Artie Shaw: Swing and Loathing,"Artie Shaw, the swing era’s other great clarinetist, knew just about every romantic self-immolator in the history of jazz. He roomed with both Bix Beiderbecke and Bunny Berigan, he hired Billie Holiday to sing with his band and — at least by his own account — he turned down Charlie Parker’s bid to join his saxophone section. (“I said, ‘Bird, you couldn’t play in my band, you’re too much of an individualist!’ ”) Superficially, Shaw couldn’t have been less like these doom-bound drunks and drug addicts. In “Three Chords for Beauty’s Sake,” Tom Nolan’s absorbing if somewhat sketchy new biography, we see him drunk exactly once — when he was in his teens and a prankish band mate fed him shots of rye with beer chasers — and once, at about 20, “half-stoned” on weed with Berigan. Thanks to clean living, good luck and, surely, a measure of cussedness, Shaw lived to be 94 and died, in 2004, the way Robert Frost recommended: “Better to go down dignified / With boughten friendship at your side / Than none at all. Provide, provide!” He even kept his sense of humor, or at least his memory of an old Myron Cohen joke. His personal assistant (who stayed with him for 11 years, sometimes by dint of repeating the word “mortgage” to himself) and his home-hospice caregiver were changing the old man’s bedclothes during his last days and asked if he was comfortable. “I make a living,” he said. He did, too.

There is a logic to this move, because the most notable thing about the team’s uniform was how much it looked like a trendy retail product. The pants, which will cost $250 in their consumer version, had the look of baggy, prefaded “distressed” jeans; the top was a plaid hooded jacket. Pretty ho-hum stuff compared with, let’s say, the spangles and feathers worn by figure skaters or the skintight hooded unitards of lugers, attire shaped either by functionality or by a kind of amped-up aesthetic spectacle. The American snowboarders appeared to have stopped off to compete in the Olympics on the way home from the mall, without even bothering to change their clothes.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02fob-consumed-t.html

African lives in the Western media are skewed toward their ends in statistical catastrophe, as if a continent with more than 50 countries were reducible to one vast, tangled necropolis.

Who else would give us a subtitle, as in his new book, that spills over and over, and begin a work of 504 pages, complete with bibliography, glossary, chronology and five appendixes, with a modest disclaimer about his “short book”? Actually, it is short when compared with his seven-volume 2003 treatise on violence, “Rising Up and Rising Down,” and the 811-page novel, “Europe Central,” that won the National Book Award in 2005.

As I’ve argued before, this is exactly the wrong way to look at the case of Charlie Crist. The Florida governor may be a moderate in some sense, but his real loyalties are to cynicism, self-interest (though this time, I’m pretty sure that he’s misjudged where those interests lie), and the persistent pursuit of the budgetary free lunch.  At a time when the country desperately needs politicians who are equipped to make tough choices, Crist’s record suggests that he’s the last person that anyone — conservative or liberal — should want to see in a position of responsibility in Washington D.C.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/dont-cry-for-charlie-crist/

2010-04-30,An Out-of-Office Message for Republican Candidates," Some 30 months from the next presidential election, the field of potential challengers to Barack Obama is like a solar system in its infancy — unformed, gaseous and lacking a dominant star. One characteristic, however, stands out. In a recent CNN poll that tested the strength of possible Republican hopefuls, only one of the seven most likely candidates (that would be Representative Ron Paul) will actually hold an elected office by the end of this year. The two leading candidates as of today, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney, haven’t held a political job in more than three years. Sarah Palin gave up her governorship when the vast Alaskan frontier became too confining for her ambition, and Newt Gingrich hasn’t run for anything since the days before Google was a verb. Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota’s governor, is leaving office at the end of the year. We’ve certainly had our share of presidents who ran as former officeholders of one kind or another: Jimmy Carter ran as an ex-governor in 1976, and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were out of office by the time they finally won the presidency. Still, you have to go back almost three decades — to the former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984 — to find a major-party candidate who didn’t hold an office on the day he clinched the nomination. Which makes it strange that a number of Republican aspirants seem to be hoping for their own version of a jobless recovery.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02fob-wwln-t.html

2010-05-03,Aspen Festival Vote Raises Questions,"The tensions that have simmered at the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado since the resignation of its music director, David Zinman, on April 8, boiled over on Thursday, when the festival corporation delivered a vote of no confidence in the festival’s president and chief executive, Alan Fletcher. This was the latest swing in the fortunes of Mr. Fletcher, who was fired by the executive committee of the board of trustees in October only to be rehired by the full board in November. The vote has no binding effect on the board, which controls hiring and firing. “We will only know what the practical effects are later,” Rob LeBuhn, the board chairman, said. But one immediate effect is to poison further an already toxic atmosphere at the venerable institution — with Tanglewood, one of the most prestigious combinations of summer music school and performance festival in the United States — as it approaches its 61st season, which opens on July 1.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/arts/music/01arts-ASPENFESTIVA_BRF.html
2010-05-03,Swiss Disagree With Lawyers for Roman Polanski,"Swiss justice officials said on Friday that they did not require access to the sealed testimony of a prosecutor involved in the case against the director Roman Polanski, even though lawyers for the filmmaker have said the testimony was needed for the officials to rule on his possible extradition to the United States. On Thursday Mr. Polanski’s American lawyers filed a motion in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking the sealed testimony of Roger Gunson, a retired deputy district attorney, about a sentencing plan devised by Judge Laurence J. Rittenband. Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl but fled the United States in 1978 before he could be sentenced by Judge Rittenband, who died in 1993. Mr. Polanski’s lawyers said the testimony would show that the United States request for his extradition was based on false and incomplete information. But Folco Galli, a Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman, told The Associated Press that the sealed testimony was irrelevant because the United States and Switzerland “have to work on the assumption that the facts in the extradition request are represented correctly.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/movies/01arts-SWISSDISAGRE_BRF.html

2010-05-03,‘Enron’ and ‘fences’ Scores Are Eligible for Tonys,"While many theatergoers associate composers’ scores with musicals, the year’s Tony Award for best score could go to a play, with productions of “Enron” (with Norbert Leo Butz, right), “Fences” and “The Royal Family” all eligible for nominations in that category. The Tony Administration Committee voted on Friday that the score of “Enron,” with music by Adam Cork and lyrics by Lucy Prebble, was eligible for best score, a category that has long been defined as music and/or lyrics created for theater, as opposed to another medium. That concept rules out the scores for the new Green Day musical, “American Idiot,” and the Afrobeat musical “Fela!” The committee decided that “Idiot” was not eligible because less than 50 percent of it was written for the Broadway production. The score for “Fela!” was ruled ineligible because much of its music is drawn from songs by its real-life main character, Fela Anikulapo Kuti. However, the original scores by Branford Marsalis for “Fences” and Maury Yeston for “The Royal Family” will be eligible for the best-score award, though both plays are revivals. Neither required votes by the committee because Mr. Marsalis and Mr. Yeston were listed in the shows’ opening-night credits.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/theater/01arts-ENRONANDFENC_BRF.html
2010-05-03,Re-evaluation Ordered In ‘rye’ Sequel Ruling,"A United States appeals court on Friday vacated a lower court’s order to enjoin the publication of a novel described as a sequel to J. D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye.” The appeals court agreed with a district court’s judgment that Salinger’s lawyers would probably prevail on the merits but told that lower court to re-evaluate whether the injunction should be ordered. Last year lawyers for Salinger successfully argued that the sequel — “60 Years Later” by the Swedish writer Fredrik Colting, using the pseudonym J. D. California — represented an illegal violation of Salinger’s copyrights. (Salinger died in January at 91.) In arguments presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, lawyers for Mr. Colting said that the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and conflicted with a unanimous 2006 Supreme Court decision that said a four-part test must be employed to determine if a patent has been violated before an injunction can be issued. In its decision, the appeals court did not rule on the prior restraint question and remanded the district court’s injunction so that court could apply the four-part test.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/books/01arts-REEVALUATION_BRF.html
2010-05-03,Hooked on Classics,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes an object is worth a thousand images. T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings’s Klismos chair looks ancient and modern at the same time — because it is. Based on ancient Greek models, which had been widely copied in the 18th and 19th centuries, Robsjohn-Gibbings’s version made the klismos shape famous again in the 20th. Obsessed with its elegant lines, he designed versions of the chair throughout his career, but the most recent examples have been made by Saridis in Athens since the early 1960s, when the designer met the company’s owners and settled in the Greek capital. Its simple but opulent curves hint at sleek penthouses with butlers who serve cocktails on the terrace at sunset. (Indeed, Robsjohn-Gibbings’s Saridis pieces have been collected by practitioners of the luxe life from Aristotle Onassis to Karl Lagerfeld.) It is also equally at home in both traditional and modern rooms. Which makes it neo and classical at the same time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/t-magazine/02endpage-t.html
