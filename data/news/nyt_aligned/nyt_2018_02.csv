The notes are usually more about the characters. I need to know the characters really well before I start — who they are, how they think, how they feel, what has happened to them, how they grew up.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/books/review/danielle-steel-fall-from-grace-best-seller.html

(The play is coming back to New York, at the Neil Simon Theater, beginning previews this month and opening in March.) In 2016, Slate published an oral history of the show, in which Mr. Kushner and more than 50 others talked about the production’s long and often difficult road to success. Now the authors of that history — Isaac Butler, a theater director himself, and Dan Kois, an editor and writer for Slate — have published a new book that expands on it: “The World Only Spins Forward: The Ascent of ‘Angels in America.’” The book covers the development and life of the play, as well as Mike Nichols’s adaptation of it as a mini-series for HBO in 2003.

That’s because the owner, Ed Raven, who also owns Greenpoint Beer & Ale nearby, is running the restaurant under a farm brewery license from the state. It permits him to serve beer by the glass without a separate license and, as a brewery owner, to open an off-premises restaurant or retail establishment. Mr. Raven has also collaborated with North Brooklyn Farms in Williamsburg for many of the ingredients used by the three chefs, each of whom has a specialty. Christian Perkins, who worked at Marlow & Daughters, is the butcher. Emma Jane Gonzalez, a vegan, and the omnivorous Kenneth Monroe come from North Brooklyn Farms. Their menu features seafood, steaks, sausages and vegetable specialties like charred sweet potatoes with kale and tahini, celery root with apples and crispy nori, and a green chile stew. Seats are at marble tables and a long, circular bar: 544 Manhattan Avenue (Driggs Avenue), Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-599-1556, annickanyc.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/dining/annicka-restaurant-bar-openings.html

It had been nearly a year since he began his one-man public-relations offensive to rebut accusations that, as a Trump campaign adviser, he colluded with Russia. He had appeared numerous times on CNN, MSNBC and the networks, typically opposite their star anchors. Unlike almost everyone else caught up in the Trump-Russia scandal, Page was not only willing to submit to public questions; he would even answer them. Though he didn’t bring much clarity to his role, the appearances did make for great, albeit surreal, television. Like the time he insisted to Anderson Cooper that his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the Republican National Convention was not actually a “meeting.” “Anderson,” Page explained, “a great analogy is you and I were members of the same health club here in New York previously. And I remember walking by you, even though we didn’t know each other, and I said, ‘Hi, Anderson,’ and you said hello, and we, you know, had a nice little exchange for half a second. Now, does that to you constitute a meeting?”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/magazine/the-happy-martyrdom-of-carter-page.html

But this year, “Dear Basketball,” which the retired N.B.A. star Kobe Bryant conceived, executive-produced and narrated, drew some #MeToo movement disapprobation when it was announced as one of the five nominees for the 90th Academy Awards. On social media and elsewhere, a 2003 sexual assault case against Mr. Bryant (which was later dismissed) was cited as a reason not to honor the movie. But the content of this short is unobjectionable on the surface. Directed by Glen Keane, the movie is an autobiographical sketch in which Mr. Bryant thanks basketball — both the object and the game — for the life he devoted to it. The animation, rendered in modes of pencils and pastels, has a gorgeous fluency to be sure. The score is by none other than John Williams, American cinema’s king of the Heroic Theme. Ultimately, “Dear Basketball” is substance-free, an advertisement for itself.

Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn’t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended.

2018-02-08,Ellsworth Kelly’s Temple for Light,"IN 1986, DOUGLAS S. Cramer — a producer of television shows including “Dynasty” and “The Love Boat” — asked the artist Ellsworth Kelly to design a free-standing structure on his vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif. Cramer was a loyal collector of the artist, and wanted Kelly to make an original, large-scale artwork for his property. Kelly, who died in December 2015 at the age of 92 and whose career was defined by stripping painting and sculpture down to their elemental components of form and color, made designs for what appears from the outside to be a simple double-barrel-vaulted building, alluding to Romanesque and Cistercian religious architecture and resembling an igloo made of stucco. Inside, the artist had planned for a number of revelations. Colored-glass windows — arranged as a grid over the entrance, as a ring of tumbling squares on one side of the building, and a sunburst on the other — would bend the light in different ways. On the walls was Kelly’s take on the stations of the cross — 14 marble panels, variations on stark black-and-white abstractions. In the rear of this single-room structure, where one would expect to find the crucifix in a Christian church, would be one of Kelly’s totem sculptures — a thin column standing over the interior like a sentinel. The project eventually fell through; Kelly kept two models of the structure in his studio, though he never really believed the chapel would be built.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/t-magazine/ellsworth-kelly-austin-last-work.html

It never made it to the stage (other than a one-time-only public reading at La Mama), becoming part of that era’s blurry subcultural lore, although its existence was mentioned in the 2014 Mueller biography “Edgewise.” T’s senior art director and a co-founder of the Kingsboro Press, Daniel Wagner, took note. “In the grand scheme of things, Cookie doesn’t have a lot of longer works published,” he says. Along with Seth Zucker of For the Common Good (a like-minded independent publishing practice) and Kingsboro’s other co-founder, Megan Plunkett, he tracked down the manuscript. “We thought it would be exciting to read, since she’s such a evocative writer, and exciting to resurface, because she’s such a beloved underground figure,” Wagner says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/t-magazine/raf-simons-drug-sweatshirt-cookie-mueller.html

She also must confront some terrifying Islamophobia, just as Ahmed herself once did. “My first experience with Islamophobia was during the Iran hostage crisis,” Ahmed says, describing how a man began hurling obscenities at her. “I was a young child. I was stunned, truly frozen. I had never heard that kind of language, had never had that kind of hate directed at me. It was a shattering moment, an event that changed my worldview.” She adds: “That is part of what I wanted to capture in ‘Love, Hate & Other Filters’ — that moment when a young person’s life is shattered by an event that has nothing to do with them.” Maya’s main narrative is shot through with a secondary tale, an unfolding act of domestic terrorism. “That story was inspired by two very specific references,” Ahmed explains, “the interstitial chapters in ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ in terms of craft and structure, and a line from ‘In Cold Blood,’ by Truman Capote: ‘Presently, the car crept forward.’ That inspired the tone, the tension I wanted to capture.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/books/review/samira-ahmed-love-hate-other-filters-best-seller.html

Fashion Scout, the international platform that nurtures and showcases young designers, invited Williams to be part of its fall/winter 2018 “Ones to Watch” runway show in London. “Currently, my brand is just me on a sewing machine in my parents’ front room,” says Williams, who recently interned with Vivienne Westwood. For inspiration, she imagined a group of goddess-like figures whose purpose is to fight the capitalist patriarchy. “I hope the feeling will be almost warrior-esque,” she told T.  Accordingly, her garments are designed to celebrate women’s bodies. “Why should women broaden their shoulders like men to feel powerful? Why not do the opposite?” she asks. Her fall/winter 2018 collection, an expansion of her graduate collection, is defined by exaggerated silhouettes and intensely textured, handcrafted textiles, which are made of mostly renewable or repurposed materials such as plastic bags. “I want my work to show that eco-fashion can still be visually exciting and push concepts and ideas beyond the fact of its sustainable ethos,” she says.

There’s also a natural affinity between him and Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, both of whom specialize in artful deconstructions of the past. “We’re looking back not in a nostalgic way but to create something new,” Bottura says. “Italians have the gene of the artisan and the poet.” Yet the restaurant is not strictly Italian: Its menu features such varied dishes as lingua in salsa verde and grilled lettuce (above), steamed Japanese buns with pork belly and apple, and even a hot dog made with Tuscany’s prized Chianina beef. — LAURA RYSMAN",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/t-magazine/design/cultural-roundup.html

I have told her that she alone will decide where she goes to school. She has expressed a strong desire to attend an in-state school. I feel guilty that I’m not pushing her to consider only the elite schools but also secretly hoping that she stays local. What are your thoughts?

He’s now 19, as slight as a reed, with hair like a tangle of spiralized carrots. His restaurant, in a pair of narrow storefronts on the Lower East Side, consists of the Living Room, an all-day cafe serving coffee, tea and pastries from morning until 5 p.m., which has just opened. In two weeks, the adjacent Dining Room will follow, with $155 (including tip) set-menu dinners. “My idea is to make it like a dinner party,” he said. So guests start with a glass of Champagne and hors d’oeuvres in the cafe before proceeding to the main room, with its simple wood tables and open kitchen, for an appetizers, followed by a couple of family-style platters of pasta and meat, like a lamb feast, with side dishes. Appetizers might include peanut Ritz Crackers with foie gras, king crab with leeks and grapefruit, and slow-roasted sunchokes with pumpkin seed oil and apple. Mr. McGarry describes Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park and Ari Taymor of Alma in Los Angeles as mentors. “They let me work in their kitchens, but gave me real responsibilities and taught me the business side, instead of just having me pluck herbs,” he said. His Ritz Crackers are just the sort of thing Mr. Humm might serve: 116 Forsyth Street (Broome Street), no phone, gem-nyc.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/gem-nyc-restaurant-news.html

The bear ambled off to climb a nearby jungle gym-like structure, fell off it once or twice, eventually gave up, and finally settled on a choice piece of bamboo to munch on.

There!” shouted a woman from the back of the skiff, pointing to a dolphin she spotted in the distance. Our young local captain cut the motor. Watching, we waited in silence. And when our group’s yoga teacher, Larissa Carlson, began to chant the sound of om — a Sanskrit word symbolizing the union of body, speech and mind — and the rest of us joined in, creating a collective, continuous round of the humming syllable. As if awakened by the vibrations of our call, a pod of dolphins emerged, leaping through the air, one after another.

Others were established by immigrants grateful for the opportunities the United States had afforded them and eager to leave a legacy in their adopted country.  Still more gardens were the creations of wealthy transplants who, while wintering in Florida, sought to recreate the gardens they loved elsewhere. With enormous resources they hired some of the nation’s landscape architects to design gardens that are as dazzling as any in the country.  Here are six of Florida’s most enticing green oases.

Mr. Gokce wore his usual outfit: a white scoop T-shirt and dark sunglasses, hair pulled back. He spoke a slow, rudimentary English as he picked apart exactly eight hard-boiled eggs in order to consume just the whites. Through a translator found in the kitchen, Mr. Gokce described a strict work regimen that dates back to his days as a butcher, toiling to provide for his family in Turkey, and to his service in the military. Now, not surprisingly, his toiling is rewarded with luxury amenities at the end of the night: For now, Mr. Gokce, a 35-year-old bachelor (with 13 children), is living at the Plaza Hotel, a short trip from his newest restaurant.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/nyregion/how-salt-bae-restaurateur-spends-his-sundays.html

2018-02-19,In Search of Lost Time in Europe’s Sanatoriums,"“SICKNESS IS THE vacation of the poor,” the early 20th-century French poet Guillaume Apollinaire once said. Around that time, European factory workers routinely left their overcrowded and soot-congested cities for the Alps, where the air was fresh, dry and unsullied by inefficient machinery. They’d return to their grueling jobs rested, rejuvenated and, so the logic went, ready to work. The sojourns were doctor-prescribed, and the sites of revival — high-altitude sanatoriums, staffed with medical workers — were often state-funded. As dramatized in Vittorio De Sica’s 1973 film “A Brief Vacation,” Clara, a Calabrian mother of three living a wretched life in industrial Milan, contracts tuberculosis and is sent to a clinic in Lombardy, where, in addition to receiving X-rays and medication, she eats lavish meals, sleeps in clean white linens, has an affair with a fellow patient, makes glamorous friends and spends inordinate amounts of time bundled up on verandas staring at snow banks. “You shouldn’t read the papers,” she overhears one fellow patient advise another. “Things are so bad, they’ll raise your fever.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/t-magazine/sanatorium-europe-history.html

A crystal ashtray sat next to silver dishes of chocolate and cigarettes. This imposing casona seemed like a fitting residence for the last living giant of a golden age of Latin American literature, a man who may well be the most politically important novelist of our time, but the house does not belong to Vargas Llosa.

Pyeongchang played a happy Olympic host, but its everyday economic reality highlights an existential threat shadowing South Korea.

2018-02-20,New & Noteworthy,"THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016 By Lanny J. Davis. (Scribner, $25.) Davis, the consummate Washington insider and former special counsel to Bill Clinton, offers his take on the 2016 election.

MAKING THE MONSTER By Kathryn Harkup. (Sigma, $27.) Could Victor Frankenstein actually have succeeded in 1818, building a man out of spare parts?

2018-02-20,Legacy Records Lends Several Dining Options to Hudson Yards,"LEGACY RECORDS Something of a pioneering spirit has driven the chef Ryan Hardy and his partners Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, of Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, to open their third restaurant, in a new residential building at the edge of the Hudson Yards development. “This is an underserved neighborhood,” Mr. Hardy said. The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls “chef-driven food,” not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls “more uptown” than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck ragù and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish. Arvid Rosengren, an award-winning sommelier, is a partner here and has assembled a mostly French and Italian wine list. Upstairs is another bar with a lively mural to set the scene, and Jeff Bell of PDT consulting on the drinks.

I don’t know that I was entirely conscious of it, because I started in photography, which is closer to 50-50. There’s this idea that there are more female cinematographers now because cameras are lighter, which is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Cinematography speaks to everything that women do inherently well: It’s multitasking, it’s empathy and it’s channeling visuals into human emotion. Little by little, I realized that I was an anomaly, but I tried not to focus on it, or to, at least, see it as a way to stand out in the crowd and bring something to the table that most people don’t.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/rachel-morrison-wants-more-women-behind-the-camera.html

2018-02-21,What Happens When Athletes Do the Sportswriting?,"Earlier this month, just before the N.B.A. trade deadline, the Cleveland Cavaliers offloaded their point guard, Isaiah Thomas, to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the second time that Thomas had been traded in the last six months, and it suggested that he was destined for a career as a journeyman scorer, plodding from team to team. Things looked very different for Thomas as recently as last summer. Back then, he was the star gunner for the Boston Celtics, and he was becoming something of a folk hero in the city. But then in August, the organization abruptly traded him to the Cavs for Kyrie Irving. At the time of the first trade, Thomas was just months off a colossal playoff run in which he played through major dental surgery, a hip labral tear and the loss of his younger sister, Chyna, in a car accident. In the days after her death, Thomas suited up against the Bulls: He had Chyna’s name written on his sneakers and fat tears pooled in his eyes. And then, as he’d done for years, Thomas — the shortest man in the N.B.A. — scored bunches of points with an intricate, endless string of feints, jabs and soft, soft jumpers.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/what-happens-when-athletes-do-the-sportswriting.html

Errors like this are especially troubling in counties like Venango, which uses touch-screen voting machines that have no backup paper trail; once a voter casts a digital ballot, if the machine misrecords the vote because of error or maliciousness, there’s little chance the mistake will be detected.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/the-myth-of-the-hacker-proof-voting-machine.html

Marx (August Diehl), a scruffy journalist, and his sidekick Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske), a renegade rich kid, meet in Cologne, Germany, in 1844 and overcome some initial wariness by bonding over their shared contempt for the Young Hegelians. (Man, those guys are lame.) They set out to write a “Critique of Critical Criticism,” and when it’s published (as “The Holy Family”), it’s something of a hit. By the time the revolutions of 1848 are ready to happen, Marx and Engels are the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the European left, rock stars for an age of revolution.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/movies/the-young-karl-marx-review.html

The temperament of nearly every other cook I’ve met further proves my theory.

Both solo musicians at the time, they quickly realized they shared a love of rap and tattoos. (The two are very well inked.) Their friendship inevitably led to the recording studio, where they made their first album as Yurufuwa Gang, “Mars Ice House,” which came out last April. Just as their look borrows from many sources — including ’50s Americana and ’80s-era hip-hop culture — their music is equally uncategorizable, moving from candyish pop to ’90s slow jams. “We don’t think a lot about what other artists are doing; we’re focused on different things,” Ishida says.

Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house. Over the coming weeks the actors took turns peeping at the likes of Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev.

But it was the scenic majesty of Alaska, as captured by the author and photographer Maya Wilson in “The Alaska From Scratch Cookbook,” that did it for me. Ms. Wilson, a blogger and chef, explains why she’s in Alaska (where it’s cold and supplies are limited), and not in California, land of tacos and avocados, and how food can provide warmth no matter where. Finding ground moose, reindeer sausage and birch syrup may be a challenge, though she gives substitutes. But her salmon recipes, like one for seared fish on a bed of kale and quinoa, appreciate the local catch, as does a simple and excellent dish of halibut in Thai curry and another for black cod with bok choy. Those recipes, along with one of the best flourless chocolate cakes I have ever made, give this book my smeared-page award: “The Alaska From Scratch Cookbook” by Maya Wilson (Rodale, $27.99).",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/dining/alaska-from-scratch-cookbook-maya-wilson.html

More substantial fare will include Wiener schnitzel and hanger steak with pumpkinseed chimichurri. Paired with the food will be Mr. Trummer’s Freudish cocktails, like the Dream Interpreter, made with absinthe, saffron elixir and Cognac; and the Dreamer, with Champagne and elderflower essence: 506 LaGuardia Place (Houston Street), 212-777-0327, bar-freud.com",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/bar-freud-restaurant-news.html

I spent the better part of a decade in the close company of that fascinating, vexing man, dead some 200 years yet far more alive to me than most of my neighbors. Now he and I were both moving on.
