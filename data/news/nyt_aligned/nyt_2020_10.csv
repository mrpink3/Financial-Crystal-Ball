Even at its silliest, the movie retains an undertow of melancholia because (as the title announces) it’s a death notice. It is also a love letter from a daughter to a father who, for the viewer, becomes fully human even as he fades away.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/movies/dick-johnson-is-dead-review.html

2020-10-02,When Invasive Species Become the Meal,"ON THE PLATE, the red lionfish looks benign, denuded of its grand mohawk of venomous spines, cut down into neat fillets, floured and flopped in a hot pan with white wine and capers, then brought to the table leaking butter. Its flesh is as white as a snapper’s, delicate and faintly sweet. To eat it seems more like decadence than righteousness. But the same fish is considered a menace in the Atlantic. Up to 20 inches long when fully grown and striated in cream and rust, it wobbles underwater with that dorsal mohawk and gauzy pectoral fins fanned out on either side, suggesting a feathered headdress set adrift, dreaming its way through life, until it backs its prey up against the reef and snaps. Its hunger is legend: The predator has been known to graze on more than 50 species, and its stomach can inflate to 30 times its natural size to accommodate its feasts, which sometimes equal 90 percent of its body weight.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/t-magazine/eating-invasive-species.html

2020-10-02,A Foosball Table That Elevates the Level of Play,"Perhaps surprisingly for a game redolent of fraternity-house basements, foosball has a sophisticated and mysterious provenance. Referred to by the British, straightforwardly, as table football, and by the French, adorably, as le baby-foot (the term “foosball” comes from the German word for soccer), it was, by some accounts, created in the 1930s by a French automobile engineer, Lucien Rosengart. The Spanish anarchist and publisher Alejandro Finisterre also claimed to have invented futbolín while recovering from injuries sustained in the Spanish Civil War, and the Englishman Harold Searles Thornton filed a patent for a similar setup in 1923. The French fashion and leather goods company Louis Vuitton, however, is less concerned with establishing the republic’s title to le baby-foot than in designing the most aesthetically pleasing version imaginable. Offered in seven different finishes, including leathers such as the brand’s textured Epi in colors like cyan and pistachio, as well as the iconic logoed canvas pictured here, the table’s hand-painted, custom-matched aluminum-cast players are modeled on the hotel porter character from Vuitton’s 1921 advertising campaign. Foosball’s origins may not be certain, but this is: You won’t find this particular amusement in the corner of some subterranean rec room. Louis Vuitton Le Babyfoot in Monogram Canvas, $71,000, (866) 844-8866.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/t-magazine/louis-vuitton-foosball.html

2020-10-02,A Tiffany Necklace That Transcends Time,"“I have the feeling of having to prove I exist … through houses and objects,” the jewelry designer Elsa Peretti once said. “I have to crystallize a form.” Peretti’s career grew out of her chance travels as a model in the late ’60s and early ’70s, when she was a muse to Helmut Newton and Halston. After stumbling upon a very tiny flower vase made of sterling silver at a flea market, which she wanted to wear as a necklace, she began sketching ideas with a silversmith in Spain. Her early creations were instinctive and macabre, inspired by animal skulls, scorpions and even X-rays of her own skeleton. In 1974, she joined Tiffany & Co. as a designer, where her sinuous and sculptural pieces — such as the Bean, Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart — quickly became signatures of the 1837-founded American jewelry house. That same year, Peretti traveled throughout Jaipur, India, and the city’s glittering light inspired her to begin working with mesh. Halston debuted a gold mesh bra and scarf designed by Peretti for Tiffany in his fall 1975 runway collection, which she produced on old machinery that had been used to make handbags in fine metal netting and chain mail in the early 20th century. The mesh designs were a hit: “Tiffany was swamped with calls from people dying to get a gold bra,” Peretti recalled.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/t-magazine/tiffany-gold-mesh-necklace.html

And indeed, there are numerous persuasive silver linings to the advent of the online show — fewer flights, lower costs and a somewhat democratic bent among them — though something else is lost. As the designer Ulla Johnson recently told T, a live fashion show — that extravagant, expensive, but undeniably exciting spectacle — generates a “crazy, buzzy energy” that a digital image or video can hardly match. And yet the videos here do two things: They remind us of a freer time in both fashion and the world, and also that creativity exists in many forms, on and off the runway, whether on the street, at an atelier workbench or with a beloved pet.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/t-magazine/fashion-month.html

Or a drama? “Time” follows Sibil Richardson, known as Fox Rich, a mother of six and a formerly incarcerated woman, as she works to free her husband, Rob, from the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary, where he’s in the midst of a mind-boggling 60-year sentence for an armed robbery where no one was hurt. The first images we see are not Bradley’s but Fox Rich’s: a riot of black-and-white home recordings that stutter-step through time. One moment Fox Rich addresses the audience, vowing that she and her family will survive despite her husband’s sentence. As proof, she offers her pregnant belly — she’s carrying twins. Time speeds up, and we see her eldest son, Remington, as a toddler, grinning hugely before diving into a pool. Then time retreats as Fox Rich reminisces about how Rob’s smile snared her heart.

As a historian I firmly believe that we have to include war in our study of human history if we are to make any sense of the past. War’s effects have been so profound that to leave it out is to ignore one of the great forces, along with geography, resources, economics, ideas, and social and political changes, which have shaped human development and changed history. If the Persians had defeated the Greek city-states in the fifth century b.c.; if the Incas had crushed Pizarro’s expedition in the sixteenth century; or if Hitler had won the Second World War, would the world have been different?

Mr. Waxman’s new cookbook about the restaurant gives its history, notably explaining why so much of his food relates to Italy. Even his famous roast chicken is slathered with salsa verde. The recipes in this book, including the chicken, are simple affairs, often amounting to a centerpiece protein precisely cooked, then dressed with a salad or vegetable and sauce. His baked hake with leeks is a fine example. Cauliflower soup and cacio e pepe are two recipes worth whipping up on short notice.

2020-10-14,The Evolution of the Onion Sandwich,"Long before James Beard was famous for championing American foods and mentoring a generation of chefs, long before he was an immediately recognizable celebrity, he was sick and tired of not being famous. Sick and tired of working in kitchens, unseen and uncelebrated, stalling out while the people around him came up. In 1940, working in obscurity as a caterer, he lifted a recipe from his colleagues Irma Rhode and her brother Bill Rhode — known as New York’s king of hors d’oeuvres — and published it as his own. It was a cute cocktail sandwich of soft, buttery bread and finely sliced onion called brioche en surprise, a hit at the events he and the Rhodes had worked together. But as Beard became more famous, the sandwich got a new, unofficial name: James Beard’s onion sandwich. Beard earned (along with a reputation for chronic, unapologetic plagiarism) his own nickname, the Dean of American Cookery. It was a good nickname, a strong nickname, though in suggesting a kind of elite prep school tucked away from the real world, it also gave away some truths about the small circle of people defining American food: They were insular, petty and competitive. And if Beard was their dean — a champion of American regional ingredients and the cooks who supported them — he was also a fragile and sometimes predatory influencer, an outsider aching for companionship and financial success.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/magazine/the-evolution-of-the-onion-sandwich.html

I had asked each to nominate five to seven works of what they considered the most powerful or influential American protest art (that is, by an American artist or by an artist who has lived or exhibited their work in America) made anytime after World War II. We focused specifically on visual art — not songs or books — and the hope was that together, we would assemble a list of the top 25. But the question of what, precisely, constitutes protest art is a thorny one — and we kept tripping over it. Is it a slogan? A poster? Does it matter if it was in a museum, in a newspaper or out on the street? Does impact matter? Did it change what you think or believe? Must it endure? What does that mean?

With his siblings already out of the house, Smith spent his adolescent years luxuriating in the company of his parents, snapping photographs that he’d develop with his father in the family attic and taking long bike rides through the Midlands. At 15, he left school intent on becoming a professional cyclist, but was forced to give up the pursuit after suffering a bad crash two years later, at which point he started spending weekends in London, hanging out with an art and music school crowd that opened his eyes to the cultural currents of the 1960s. Often, he’d go to concerts and hawk homemade silk-screened T-shirts he’d made to whomever was performing (Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton) and use some of his earnings to pay for the gas to get home. “I came from a working-class family and I had no money, no education,” says Smith. “I had to make it work, and I liked clothes.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/t-magazine/paul-smith-profile-in-style.html

2020-10-16,On Recent Criticism of The 1619 Project,"The 1619 Project, which was conceived of and led by Nikole Hannah-Jones, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, advances a bold claim: that the date when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the English colonies that would become the United States — August of 1619 — can be regarded as the nation’s birth or point of origin. Why does the project propose this? In part because, as its essays show, the system of slavery and oppression that began on this date has led to so many of the problems that define our past and our present; in part because, as Hannah-Jones argues, the struggle against this system of oppression has been a pivotal freedom movement unfolding across many generations to advance progress for American society as a whole; and in part to advance the case that, as the heroes of both of these stories, Black Americans, whose presence in the English colonies that would become the United States began on this date, should occupy a central role in American history.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/magazine/criticism-1619-project.html

Over the decades, they manufactured traveling goods for royals, fin de siècle explorers and their jet-setting clientele — and created custom carrying kits for everything from books and cigars to perfumes and polo gear. Perhaps their most famous special order, however, came in 1932, when Gaston-Louis Vuitton (the founder’s grandson) received a request from a champagne producer who wanted him to design a leather bag he could give as a gift to his clients. He had only two requirements: It should bear the weight of multiple bottles and stand the test of time. Gaston went to work, and soon the Noé was born. With its tapered rectangular base, the versatile bucket bag could fit five bottles of bubbly: four standing upright and one flipped upside down in the center.

No stranger to challenges, Mr. Dorf said he started the City Winery brand in a major economic downturn, and now, “I am launching our new flagship during a global pandemic.” Planned music events, for which City Winery is known, have yet to be permitted. There’s a cellar with 1,200 bottles and a Mediterranean menu from the chef Robert Hamburg that includes pizza and assorted flatbreads.

Often working from photographs or film, Tuymans does not paint straight reproductions, but disquieting versions of characters and scenes from cultural memory — at once familiar and made strange by his signature muted tones. His work “The Secretary of State” (2005), which is in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection, is a desaturated and tightly cropped close-up of Condoleezza Rice, squinting as though she has been caught with the sun in her eyes or in a moment of deliberation. Many of Tuymans’s notable early paintings concern the Holocaust, including “Gas Chamber” (1986), which he adapted from a watercolor he painted on-site at Dachau, and “Schwarzheide” (1986), based on a background detail of pine trees from a 1945 drawing of the titular concentration camp by survivor Alfred Kantor. Alongside the horrors of war and imperialism, everyday objects and popular iconography have recurred in Tuymans’s paintings throughout his career.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/t-magazine/luc-tuymans.html

The counters were topped with well-worn butcher block. And the stove was her treasured Garland, which she bought in 1956 and said she would take to her grave. (It’s in the Smithsonian now.)

You want the ashes to disperse out onto the land or water rather than blow back in your face.

The average cremated adult will produce about five pounds of pulverized bone fragments, a coarse powder that is sterile and safe to touch, even if the person died of a communicable disease. Try to scatter, not dump. “It helps to have a trowel or a spoon or ladle or something to scoop with,” Rubin says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/magazine/how-to-scatter-cremated-remains.html

It’s early evening still, the shades are drawn, he has yet to cook dinner. The day has been hectic — deadlines, dog to the vet, a leak beneath the sink — but that’s all behind him now, a soft quiet settling in. His head rolls on the pillow, with intention and control, from side to side, each ear touching down like the taps of a metronome. Tap. Tap. Tap. His hips follow suit, and soon his whole body is in one smooth kinesis. He feels his pulse slow and his breaths even out. He’s free, dreaming of other worlds, worlds with many moons, with humming tides. Twenty minutes pass, and something brings him back to Earth — a car alarm, or his partner asking from another room what he’s making for dinner. He climbs out of bed, lighter, less burdened.

2020-10-22,How to Create Your Own Herbal Tea Garden,"The tea garden — a typically modest plot dedicated to the growing of herbs and flowers for steeping — has its roots in ancient herbalist traditions and helped lay the foundation for modern botany. According to “The Gardener’s Companion to Medicinal Plants,” a 2016 guide to home remedies, the study of herbal medicine can be traced back 5,000 years, to the Sumerians of southern Mesopotamia, who listed the names of hundreds of plants — including fennel, mint, thyme, sage, myrtle and marjoram — on clay tablets that were later rediscovered in what is now Iraq. Modern scholars believe that the Sumerians used what they grew in medicinal preparations such as tea infusions that were intended to treat ailments from toothache to inflammation. And in England, says Timothy d’Offay, a tea importer and the founder of Postcard Teas in London, tea gardens have their origins in the work of 17th-century apothecaries such as Nicholas Culpeper, a botanist and physician whose encyclopedia of herbs, “The English Physician,” has remained in print since it was first published in 1653. “The apothecaries’ focus was on the use of herbs in healing,” explains d’Offay. “It was really the beginnings of modern medicine.

The person is told to go up and get the bicycle. But it’s only a drawing, he says. He is told that if he doesn’t bring the bicycle down the stairs, he will be beaten. And when, again, he appeals to his torturer’s reason, to the reality in which both the staircase and the bicycle are drawings, he is hit. At this moment he understands that he has been left alone in a reality he believed was shared. He has been abandoned there, while the others have departed to a new reality in which a person can be tortured for being unable to do what is asked because it is physically impossible.

In 1998, Meredeen and a friend, both 68 and living alone, went to a presentation about co-housing, an outgrowth from the communes of the 1960s, which started in Denmark among private households clustered around shared spaces. Afterward, Meredeen and her friend imagined a place where women could age together and not end up in a nursing home, alone, “dribbling in the corner,” Meredeen says. “We wanted to be in charge of our own lives as we got older.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/magazine/how-to-build-an-intentional-community.html

Or three? The glasses didn’t seem to help. The fuzzy, faded marks refused to become letters. The right side of her head throbbed — as it had for weeks. The constant aggravation of the headache made everything harder, and it certainly wasn’t helping her read this label. She rubbed her forehead, then brought her hand down to cover her right eye. The box disappeared into darkness. She could see only the upper-left corner of the instructions. Everything else was black. She quickly moved her hand to cover her left eye.

2020-10-28,Cookbooks Help Me Escape These Days,"Years before I ever stepped foot in Rome or the Chianti Valley, I traveled there by reading cookbooks. I pored through Ada Boni’s “Italian Regional Cooking,” committing pictures to memory so that one day I might, say, set up my own wood-fired rotisserie and prepare three different types of fowl at once, too. I learned from the photos in midcentury cookbooks how fresh anchovies and piles of sunbaked sea salt are harvested in Sicily. When I read “Honey From a Weed,” I sopped up the flavors of Patience Gray’s tales of cooking off the land while chasing marble across the Mediterranean with her sculptor beau. From a handful of single-subject books I still treasure, I spent hours learning about the regional differences in pasta sauces and the individual histories of dozens, if not hundreds, of pasta shapes I hoped to one day taste. I grew to love the hot-blooded, tradition-protecting Italian culinary sensibility I got to know through these books — so much so that I learned the language and eventually moved to the country.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/magazine/cookbooks-help-me-escape-these-days.html
