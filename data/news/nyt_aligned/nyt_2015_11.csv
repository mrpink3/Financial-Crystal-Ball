If their funnel-shaped Gemini spacecraft doesn’t spring a leak, Air Force Maj. Frank Borman and his co-pilot, Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Lovell, intend to doff their silver spacesuits and continue the 14-day flight in regulation Air Force long johns. Long practiced by Russian cosmonauts, the so-called ‘‘shirt-sleeve’’ flight was not to become a part of the U.S. space program until the three-man Apollo spacecraft begin flying in 1967. Behind the change in plans is the absolute confidence that Gemini’s pressure hull will not expose the astronauts to the vacuum of space. If it did collide with a meteoroid or suffered explosive decompression for some other reason, the astronauts would pass out in less than a minute. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 2, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/1965-gemini-astronauts-to-fly-in-long-johns/

President Vladimir Putin has made victimhood at America’s hands a leitmotif of his reign, and many Russians have bought into his claim that Washington tirelessly seeks ways to weaken, impoverish and otherwise humiliate their country. Many critics of Putin, in Russia and in the West, similarly hold that Washington’s treatment of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union was disdainful and thus undermined embryonic moves toward democracy, contributing to the rise of Putinism.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/winter-is-coming-by-garry-kasparov.html

Once they were done ransacking the offices that had inspired so much terror, they directed their anger down the street toward the K.G.B. residence where Lieutenant Colonel Putin, a young intelligence officer, stood looking out the window. Watching the approaching mob, Putin called the local Soviet military command and asked for reinforcements.

2015-11-02,Michel Houellebecq’s ‘Submission’,"Before I begin this review, I have to make a small confession. I have never read Michel Houellebecq’s books. This is odd, I concede, since Houellebecq is considered a great contemporary author, and one cannot be said to be keeping abreast of contemporary literature without reading his work. His books have been recommended to me ever since 1998, most often “The Elementary Particles,” by one friend in particular, who says the same thing every time I see him. You have to read “The Elementary Particles,” he tells me, it’s awesome, the best book I’ve ever read. Several times I’ve been on the verge of heeding his advice, plucking “The Elementary Particles” from its place on my shelf and considering it for a while, though always returning it unread. The resistance to starting a book by Houellebecq is too great. I’m not entirely sure where it comes from, though I do have a suspicion, because the same thing goes for the films of Lars von Trier: When “Antichrist” came out I couldn’t bring myself to see it, neither in the cinema nor at home on the DVD I eventually bought, which remains in its box unwatched. They’re simply too good. What prevents me from reading Houellebecq and watching von Trier is a kind of envy — not that I begrudge them success, but by reading the books and watching the films I would be reminded of how excellent a work of art can be, and of how far beneath that level my own work is. Such a reminder, which can be crushing, is something I shield myself from by ignoring Houellebecq’s books and von Trier’s films. That may sound strange, and yet it can hardly be unusual. If you’re a carpenter, for instance, and you keep hearing about the amazing work of another carpenter, you’re not necessarily going to seek it out, because what would be the good of having it confirmed that there is a level of excellence to which you may never aspire? Better to close your eyes and carry on with your own work, pretending the master carpenter doesn’t exist.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/michel-houellebecqs-submission.html

The show came to represent the brewing movement of image-based artists — those who “had a broader perspective of how we read images, and really entered the picture again, and what that means,” Brauntuch says. “Pictures” operated as a bellwether, in stark contrast to then-fashionable Minimalism and abstraction. “We came out of a time when ‘art’ was not what we were doing, which is why we were doing what we were doing.” His years in New York in the late ’70s and 1980s were spent running up the ladder alongside his friends, like Cindy Sherman, Matt Mullican, David Salle, Goldstein and Longo, whose careers exploded onto the superstar level. He counted Richard Prince and Dike Blair among his golfing buddies, too. “We played religiously,” Brauntuch says. “We also played in a poker game for decades.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/t-magazine/troy-brauntuch-petzel-gallery.html

He has serious skin issues and was recently diagnosed with lymphoma. Like most dogs, despite all he has been through, he has a sweet doggy spirit. He also has a team of specialists — a dermatologist, an oncologist and his regular vet. At the moment, he is comfortable and happy. When the time comes (most likely in the next year), we will see him through to a gentle death. We have the resources to take care of him, but he is expensive — think car payment, not mortgage payment. He doesn’t look like a regular dog, and people know he has a medical routine. There is a lot of unsolicited judgment, mostly in three camps: those who think we should devote the same amount of resources to charitable animal-related organizations and not an individual dog, people who think it is wrong to ‘‘put a dog through chemo’’ and people who think it’s morally wrong to exert so much effort on an animal. We mostly just love our dog. What do you think? C. S., Portland, Ore.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/how-much-can-we-spend-to-keep-our-dog-alive.html

2015-11-05,How to Help,"Every day in 2014, an average of 42,500 people left their homes looking for protection and safety elsewhere, and the number of refugees in the world has quadrupled in the past five years, to close to 60 million. More than 50 percent of those refugees are children, the highest figure for child refugees in more than a decade. Chuol, Hana and Oleg — the children featured in the New York Times Magazine article “The Displaced” — are three young refugees who were forced to leave everything behind because of violence, conflict and persecution.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/how-to-help.html
2015-11-05,The Displaced: Oleg,"Oleg Teryokhin was living with his mother and father in Nikishino, a rural village of fewer than 1,000 coal miners, farmers and their families in eastern Ukraine, when fighting broke out in April 2014. Hastily formed separatist militias, goaded and armed by Moscow, rose up in a rebellion against a new, pro-Western government in Kiev. In the first months of the conflict, the fighting was far from Nikishino, and Oleg, then 10, spent the early summer tearing about the village on his bicycle, zipping past its old brick cottages and apricot orchards. Then, in July, scorched scraps of clothing and bits of paper with foreign writing blew through the village — debris from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the passenger jet that was shot down, killing hundreds of people whose bodies lay in fields just south of the village. When Oleg carried some of these items home, his mother, Galina, was horrified that the conflict had come so close.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-oleg.html

Her face is blank with uncertainty, but she strikes a bossy pose — one hand on her hip, the other planted firmly against the bundles. Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy — her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945.

2015-11-05,The Displaced: Hana,"At 4:45 in the morning on a Saturday in early August, stars were still bright in the sky above a refugee settlement in rural Lebanon where Hana Abdullah, a 12-year-old girl from Syria, now lives. The morning call to prayer floated down a dusty road and wound its way around the mostly silent tents. At 5 o’clock, Hana was still sleeping on her bamboo mat by the edge of her family’s tent, her arms folded, her hands under her head. Her baby brother and three of her four sisters slept nearby. Many mornings Hana was up at 4 o’clock. She worked in the nearby fields of Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, picking fruits or vegetables, and everyone started early. But today the truck that would take her there was late. Now came its familiar rumble, next the crunching of gravel: She stirred, her mouth twitched, her eyelids fluttered. Then she was up, vertical in one swift movement, stretching, pulling on a hat from a stash of her belongings. She grabbed lunch — a tomato, and a pita she folded around a potato — and ducked outside to wait on one of the benches in front of her tent.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-hana.html

Tanaka constructs three-dimensional dioramas, composed of overlapping multiple layers of photo collages, assembled and photographed to illustrate the “landscapes of my memory,” as she puts it: images that might serve as jumping-off points for all sorts of fairy-tales. The artist constructs her collages with family photos taken when she was growing up in a small village in the mountains of Japan; more recent personal snapshots; self-portraits; and pictures of everyday objects taken from the Internet that become symbols evocative of her childhood memories. The artist herself takes on a poetic tone when discussing her work. “At times in my day-to-day life, I find myself stumbling over reminders of days gone by. Partly formed memories rise up from a forgotten abyss within, surrounding me like a powerful fragrance and rocking my emotions to the core,” she says. “In these moments, I am seized with the desire to gather and collect, to retrieve what has been lost and weave it into something whole.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/t-magazine/japanese-photo-collages-ayumi-tanaka.html

2015-11-06,"A Take on Seurat, Unseen Since the ’70s","“Years ago,” says Roberta Cerini Baj, the widow of the Italian neo-avant garde artist Enrico Baj, “I remember that my daughter, Marianna, told Enrico, ‘When you see paintings in the house, you treat them like friends. When you see them outside of it, in an exhibition, they look totally different.’ And usually, this is true” — though not in the case of Luxembourg & Dayan’s current gathering of her husband’s pieces. The intimate gallery, which is wallpapered and homey, is filled with 50 works by the late artist. Among them is “The Double Grande Jatte,” her husband’s homage to and spin on Georges Seurat’s exercise in pointillism, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.” Its inclusion represents a reunion for Roberta, who last saw “The Double Grande Jatte” when it was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 1971. “I found it so fresh here,” she remarks. “When he was making it, we were in an apartment in Milan and there was a door between the living room and the studio,” and the 20-foot-long mural ran parallel to the door jambs. “It was in front of us all of the time and at the end, Enrico said, ‘I understand now why Seurat died so young, from getting bored of making all of those points.’” A quip, sure, but fitting for someone consumed by the need for change.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/t-magazine/enrico-baj-double-grande-jatte.html

The doctrine goes something like this: Western art of the early 20th century develops in a single direction, toward abstraction. Artists working toward that goal were the true radicals. Those who held onto representation were aesthetic conservatives (whatever their actual politics).Conveniently enough, the artists who broke most definitively with figuration, and who made abstract painting and sculpture into the One True Art, were living in New York — the city that, in the words of the art historian Serge Guilbaut, “stole the idea of Modern art” from Paris after World War II.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/arts/design/soldier-spectre-shaman-an-alternate-history-at-moma.html

It contains the same four drugs as Stribild, but with the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate replaced by tenofovir alafenamide. The new form of the inhibitor, Gilead said, enters cells where H.I.V. replicates more efficiently, resulting in 91 percent less tenofovir in the bloodstream. That should make the pill less likely to cause kidney damage or loss of bone density, which have become major problems among people with H.I.V. who survive into old age.",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/science/fda-approves-genvoya-a-new-one-pill-treatment-for-hiv.html

Ivan, the gorilla, frees himself and a young elephant by communicating with humans through finger-painting. “Ivan” was a winning tale for many ­reasons: It was based, loosely, on a true story; it addressed the issue of animal cruelty honestly, but in a manner that children could handle; it was technically original, telling the story from Ivan’s perspective, in short chapters that read like prose poems. But the primary reason “Ivan” has become such a beloved book is Ivan himself. His frank wisdom about life, both human and animal, provokes laughter and thought; his aspirations — to become an artist, and to liberate himself through art — feel universal.

This salience has some rationale: Hunger makes food a priority, and poor people spend about half of their income on it. But hunger is, nevertheless, a symptom of poverty, not a problem to be tackled in isolation — the solution to hunger may not have much to do with the supply of food. In this rambling book, David Rieff never quite recognizes this fundamental point. Positing that the 2008 spike in global food prices marked the start of structurally higher prices, his discussion revolves around whether we should look for the solution of extra food production in technocratic philanthropy, global agribusiness or revolutionary politics. Arriving at an answer that none look promising, he asks, “Where does this leave us?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/the-reproach-of-hunger-by-david-rieff.html

It tells the story of Wayne and Kelly Maines, a good-hearted, hard-working American couple, neither rich nor poor, neither fabulous nor downtrodden, who after years of trying to conceive a baby are finally given the opportunity to adopt: infant boys, identical twins, the children of Kelly’s second cousin. The Maineses name the babies Jonas and Wyatt, and immediately the low expectations that come with unmet yearning give way to the more self-centered aspirations that accompany getting what you want. Fantasies of imprinting upon these inchoate beings a storybook childhood preoccupy both parents, but especially Wayne, who sees in fatherhood a chance at passing down the rites and traditions of American manhood. Still in the hospital, Wayne cradles the babies and murmurs to them as if reciting a prayer: My boys, my boys. “We’re going to have so much fun together,” he whispers in the twins’ ears. “We’re going to go hunting and fishing and I will teach you everything I know.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/becoming-nicole-by-amy-ellis-nutt.html

It’s 1911, the tail end of the Gilded Age, and world wars have yet to break out. Janet keeps a diary, and the reader quickly gleans that her notions of life come from three books: “Jane Eyre,” “Dombey and Son” and “Ivanhoe.” “I plan to go on as bravely as a heroine in a novel,” she writes. “In my new life I’m not going to be vulgar.

2015-11-06,"‘The Rest of Us Just Live Here,’ by Patrick Ness","At my typical public high school in an average-size town, I was surrounded by a lot of kids just like me — that is to say, no one had any special powers. There were no vampires. No witches. No werewolves or shape shifters or zombie fighters. No one was on a mission to save the world from the forces of evil. Mostly, we were learning to drive cars, trying to pass calculus, angling for the first glimmerings of what adult relationships might hold. We were teenagers, for all the beauty and mundanity in that. It was horrible, fantastic, brutal, magical and sometimes utterly boring. It was, in a word, life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/the-rest-of-us-just-live-here-by-patrick-ness.html

Rick Riordan, after the well-earned triumph of his two Percy Jackson series, tales of an all-American boy who discovers that he is the son of a Greek god, now embarks, with “Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Sword of Summer,” on an entirely new series, this one about a not-quite-all-American boy who discovers he is the son of . . . a Norse god. The boys are certainly different ­— Magnus, our new hero, a Kurt Cobain look-alike, starts out homeless and a petty thief in Boston, where Percy was at boarding school.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/rick-riordans-magnus-chase-and-the-gods-of-asgard.html

A mere mention of “All Quiet on the Western Front” or “I Am the Cheese,” and I’m right back to brooding again in the ocean-deep emotions of my adolescence. What is that urge, the desire to soak in anguish and injustice as we come of age? Whatever it is, Ashley Hope Pérez’s new novel, “Out of Darkness,” fills the need. Her layered tale of color lines, love and struggle in an East Texas oil town is a pit-in-the-stomach family drama that goes down like it should, with pain and fascination, like a mix of sugary medicine and artisanal moonshine. I actually had to close the book at one point to seek respite with Facebook. And puppies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/out-of-darkness-by-ashley-hope-perez.html

And fresh stains, too, like exaggerated income inequality. Likewise, the reality of the elite, exceptional American child is hardly as pristine as many parents imagine. Our “gifted and talented” Mandarin-speaking, travel-team-­captaining, polished-in-selfies youth are often characterized by narcissism, the pursuit of achievement at any cost, toxic stress and greed: grade greed, accomplishment greed, résumé greed. Precocious superstardom is not always happy. And regular, average childhood is not necessarily a problem that needs fixing.

Backyards, driveways and rooftops take cover under white and everything is changed. Snow means gloves and boots and anticipation. It doubles your speed downhill, then cushions your fall at the bottom. It makes it much harder for school buses to reach their destination. But as three new books show, our captivation lies in something more than the break from routine and the opportunity for daredevil stunts. We make snowmen, we make angels, we build fortresses and we leave our footsteps wherever we go. After it snows, we sculpture the world around us, carving out stages upon which our imaginations perform.

2015-11-06,Steve Sheinkin’s ‘Most Dangerous’,"About 70 pages into his gripping new history for young readers, “Most Dangerous: Daniel Ellsberg and the Secret History of the Vietnam War,” Steve Sheinkin seems to switch genres, describing a scene that could have been taken from “The Walking Dead”: a trailer full of corpses, its floor “streaked with blood and brains.” Arms and legs were falling off the rotting trunks, which made it difficult to count how many bodies were in the trailer. The stench was unbearable. So the bodies were hosed down and the trailer tipped to its side, letting, as one witness put it, a “rivulet of blood-colored water” flow outside. A delegation of American military officers passed by, stepping over the blood “to avoid ruining the shine on their boots.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/steve-sheinkins-most-dangerous.html

In a profile last year, The Telegraph noted that Cornwell has “the coiled-up, fight-or-flight air of a lynx about to spring,” a trait evident on her website’s home page, where a video shows her coolly handling an MP5 submachine gun. “I can’t imagine writing about a certain type of rifle or a type of shotgun or a certain handgun for anything, and not having any experience with it,” she explains in the video. Cornwell has been known to take her research to extremes: She spent six years in a forensics lab to learn Scarpetta’s job and went on to scuba dive, fly a helicopter and stab sides of beef wrapped in wool, all in the name of getting things right. “People now have such short attention spans that I have to try really hard to keep the suspense going, so they don’t have a reason to put down my book and read 20,000 tweets instead,” Cornwell told The Telegraph. “Crime novels are a great excuse to get people together and to . . . examine issues that affect us all,” she added. “The crime is just the party to get the people to show up.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Consequently, it raised eyebrows in official Washington today [Nov. 8] when Robert C. Weaver, the highest- ranking Negro in the government, answered ‘‘yes,’’ when asked whether he wanted the cabinet post of secretary of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department, still headless, comes into being at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. President Johnson hasn’t indicated his choice for the new cabinet post, and won’t until early next year, according to a White House announcement over the weekend. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 9, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/1965-african-american-seeks-cabinet-post/

These articles were alleged to be ‘‘the property of his majesty,’’ but Gerald Thesiger, defending Harry Foulds, member of the Home Guard, cited the judgment of a prize court of 1748. That court had held that a subject was entitled to whatever he could take from the King’s enemies and that such property had never been vested in the crown. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 9, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/1940-robbing-nazi-prisoner-is-legal-under-british-law/

2015-11-10,Russia: Official Says Delayed Deal to Sell Iran Missiles Remains in Force,"Russia’s most senior arms executive said Monday that a contract to supply Iran with powerful S-300 air defense missiles was now active. But with no delivery date or any other details, the announcement seemed aimed more at warding off an Iranian lawsuit than a major step toward delivery of the weapon system. Sergei V. Chemezov, Russia’s chief arms trade executive, made the announcement at an air show in Dubai, Russian news agencies reported. “The contract to deliver the S-300 was not only signed by both sides, but has already come into force,” Mr. Chemezov was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. The initial contract to deliver the weapons was signed in 2007, before the current international arms embargo against Iran was established. But the deal was canceled in 2010 by Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia’s president, under pressure from the United States and Israel. In response, Iran filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract that could cost Moscow as much as five times the $800 million value of the original deal. President Vladimir V. Putin reversed Mr. Medvedev’s decision in April, as a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers began to appear likely. But the system still has not been delivered. The hitch, military experts say, is that Russia wants to keep the unfulfilled contract as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, perhaps with an eye to ending economic sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine.

The Conservatives were routed by the Liberal Party last month. The new Liberal government said Monday that the diversion could go ahead, provided that the city addressed concerns raised by a panel of scientists. That review found that while dumping the sewage was not ideal, it was preferable to the potential consequences of a sewer failure.

He saw it in 1932: the dark, sinuous bodies of three African boys — their rhyming legs at the place where sea meets land; their interweaving arms dialed to varying heights; their interlocking limbs creating abstract shapes; and the grace note, on the left side, of a single silhouetted arm.

2015-11-12,Senate Approves Research Into Combat Effects on Mental Health,"Research into veterans’ suicide received a lift on Tuesday with Senate passage of a measure requiring an independent research program on the effects of combat service on suicide rates and other mental health issues among troops and veterans. A report by The New York Times in September found that monitoring of suicide was not coordinated between the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, and many veterans fell through the cracks because the effect of combat exposure was poorly tracked.   After more than decade of war, neither department has the data to show whether troops exposed to combat have a higher risk of suicide, and how that risk changes over time. Because of this, veterans say suicide prevention programs do not fit their needs. “We simply don’t know enough about the effects of combat on mental health issues among service members and veterans both during and after service,” said the amendment’s sponsor, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. The measure passed as part of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016.

As I gnawed my way up the Dolomite peak of Kronplatz mountain, I had to stop every 100 yards and catch my breath. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the trek would be difficult or that I should bring water. But whatever panic and thirst and lung-burn I experienced was mitigated by the frosted clover and edelweiss and enzian, which I could see the sun thawing in real time as I walked.

2015-11-12,The Secrets in Greenland’s Ice Sheet,"At one point several hundred thousand years ago, snow began falling over the center of the earth’s largest island. The snow did not melt, and in the years that followed, storms brought even more. All around Greenland, the arctic temperatures remained low enough for the snow to last past spring and summer. It piled up, year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium. Eventually, the snow became the Greenland ice sheet, a blanket of ice so huge that it covered 650,000 square miles and reached a thickness of 10,000 feet in places. Meanwhile, in Antarctica, a similar process was well underway. There, as snow fell upon snow for years without end, the ice sheet spread out over a much vaster area: 5.4 million square miles, an expanse far larger than the lower 48 states. By the start of the modern era, when power plants and electric lights began illuminating the streets of Manhattan, about 75 percent of the world’s freshwater had been frozen into the ice sheets that lay over these lands at opposite ends of the earth.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-secrets-in-greenlands-ice-sheets.html

By the time he died from an overdose in 2009 at the age of 27, he had come to stand almost single-handedly for a downtown New York art and party scene that arose just before 9/11 and flourished in the anxious years afterward, known for its drug-fueled excess and adolescent rebellion in the face of a city rapidly becoming more homogeneous, wealth-obsessed and heavily policed. That Mr. Snow came from art-world privilege — he was an estranged member of the de Menil collecting family — made the narrative that grew up around him all the more loaded.

Toward the end of her life, when her daughter Isabella Rossellini asked why she had kept so many letters, diaries, photos and other mementos, Bergman responded with consummate movie-star sang-froid: “I always knew I was going to be famous.” (She died in 1982 at 67.)

Corey Jones, 31, a housing inspector and musician, died Oct. 18 after his car broke down in the middle of the night off Interstate 95 in Palm Beach County. Palm Beach Gardens Police officer Nouman K. Raja was working a burglary detail when he approached Mr. Jones’s car in an unmarked van. Mr. Raja told the authorities that Mr. Jones confronted him with a gun, so the officer fired six times, striking Mr. Jones three times as he fled. The officer came under criticism for failing to show his badge, and because Mr. Jones had acquired his gun legally. Mr. Raja, who joined the police department in April, was still in his probationary period, making it easier for the city to terminate his employment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office are investigating the shooting.

2015-11-13,Inside the List,"No Joy: The Republican debates aren’t the only place Donald Trump and Ben Carson are duking it out these days. They’re also competing on the hardcover nonfiction list, where Carson’s book “A More Perfect Union” (written with his wife, Candy Carson) is No. 4 after five weeks and Trump’s book “Crippled America” makes its debut at No. 5. Both men have been here before, of course, Carson with two previous best sellers and Trump with eight (most notably “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” written with Tony Schwartz, which spent 48 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list in 1987 and 1988). So what do their books reveal about the candidates? Nothing we didn’t know already from watching them campaign. Carson is genial and bland in advancing his model of Christian conservatism; in his latest book, a paean to the Constitution, each chapter opens with a Bible verse. And Trump is blustery and vain and entertaining. Here he is discussing his book’s cover, which shows him with a stern Sam the Eagle frown: “Some readers may be wondering why the picture we used on the cover of this book is so angry and so mean looking. I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am. My family loved those pictures and wanted me to use one of them. The photographer did a great job. But I decided it wasn’t appropriate. In this book we’re talking about Crippled America — that’s a tough title. Unfortunately, there’s very little that’s nice about it. . . . So I wanted a picture where I wasn’t happy, a picture that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel, rather than joy. There’s nothing to be joyful about.

But a storm arises as the men depart and when eventually they wash ashore their task is no longer exploration but survival. Echoes of Captain Scott’s disastrous Antarctic expedition ring through the story of the fictitious Kismet, but are never overplayed, and the Kismet’s venture slips plausibly among the other known sagas of this so-called Heroic Age of exploration.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/rebecca-hunts-everland.html

Kamikaze-style, suicidal defense will forever be associated with Japan. But it was Nazi Germany that actually immolated itself. While Hitler lived, there could be no negotiation. There would be no surrender, no repeat of the November 1918 armistice. The result was the devastation not only of much of Central Europe, but also of Germany itself. In the course of the war, 5.3 million men would die fighting in Wehrmacht uniform. Close to a million German civilians were killed in air raids and the ethnic cleansing that followed the war. Germany’s casualties far exceeded those of all of Western Europe put together. And the violence escalated as the war went on. The largest number died in the last desperate months, the worst being January 1945, when the Wehrmacht lost 450,000 — more in a matter of weeks than America would suffer in all of its wars of the 20th century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/the-german-war-by-nicholas-stargardt.html

It also marked the beginning of his friendship with Brown, who at the time worked as an assistant at the gallery. Now in the collection of MoMA, “Untitled (Free)” — considered a masterwork of relational aesthetics — was the first of many interactive projects realized by the twosome. Their latest scheme: a gallery-meets-kitchen in Hancock, N.Y. Lovingly referred to as Unclebrother (the name is an inside joke), the hybrid restaurant revives the generous spirit of Tiravanija and Brown’s inaugural partnership, but adds in a full-time, brick-and-mortar locale. “It’s the first time he’s had a commercial kitchen, so it’s a departure in that sense,” Brown says. “It’s a natural progression, in a way.

In 1974, with “Knuckle,” Hare broke through to the West End, among the first of his generation of Oxbridge Young Turks to do so. As a resident dramatist, he ascended the food chain of British theater: from disputatious bouts at the Royal Court to the Nottingham Playhouse during Richard Eyre’s brilliant regime and all the way up to the National Theater, where by 1984 he was an associate director, co-creating the influential Joint Stock Company along the way.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/the-blue-touch-paper-a-memoir-by-david-hare.html

From where I stood, neither demographic projections nor existing patterns of assimilation nor the continent’s ideological currents seemed to support a vision of a Europe where “Shariah has as much clout as liberalism” by, say, 2045. Instead, I argued that the European future would probably be like the present, only more so:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/europes-darkened-future/

They are sometimes hard to watch, and always hard to forget. “Love” is no exception: Noé’s latest film centers on Murphy, an American living in Paris, and his erotically charged relationships; it features many minutes’ worth of unsimulated onscreen sex. (It was also filmed in 3D, and if there’s anything you’re imagining Noé might exploit that technology to depict, you’re probably right.)

2015-11-17,Making Bathrooms More ‘Accommodating’,"The clearest visual markers of sex difference many of us see in the course of the day are the signs on public bathroom entrances: MEN on one door, WOMEN on the other. Restrooms are public conveniences, freely available in most places and in principle open to all, but the terms for entering them have been fixed.

If people think you’ve confused male and female and walked through the wrong door, you risk discomfort, or even real trouble. This can lead to the spectacle of women standing in line for what feels like forever while the men’s room is empty. Now transgender people, most prominently, are asking society to rethink all of this, from signs to design to who gets to enter where.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/making-bathrooms-more-accommodating.html

2015-11-18,Spike Seen in Reported Cases of Sexually Transmitted Diseases,"Syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are rising at alarming rates, according to figures released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Syphilis infections reported by doctors rose 15 percent from 2013 to 2014; cases of gonorrhea increased 5 percent, and chlamydia 3 percent. The agency called the diseases “a substantial health challenge.” Syphilis cases have more than tripled since 2000, and 91 percent are in men — mostly gay and bisexual men. Dr. Gail Bolan, the agency’s director of prevention of sexually transmitted disease, said there was “no single answer” for the increase, but noted several factors. State and local spending on prevention and treatment has shrunk as screening of gay men has picked up. Many gay men start antiretroviral drugs as soon as they are infected with H.I.V., and others take Truvada to prevent infection; there have been reports that condom use has dropped in this population as a result. Although those drugs prevent H.I.V. infection and transmission, they do not prevent the spread of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papilloma virus, herpes or trichomoniasis.

Coney back then was a derelict dystopia of burned-out lights and empty rides and sea gulls lying dead beneath the boardwalk — a place of which the smoking dog’s owner once explained, “It’s an interesting kind of crazy.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/arts/design/coney-island-the-cyclone-the-hot-dogs-the-art.html

Instead of foraging elsewhere, the researchers found, the excluded birds stuck close to their feeding partners.

Yet despite their widespread reputation for cruelty, we have little evidence that girls are meaner than boys. It’s no surprise to learn that boys are more likely than girls to use physical aggression, but we also know that boys surpass girls when it comes to attacking peers verbally and engaging in cyberbullying. Some research suggests that girls pick up the slack by engaging in more relational aggression: being emotionally manipulative, spreading rumors, excluding peers. But other studies find that boys can outpace, or at least match, girls in the use of indirect forms of interpersonal treachery.",U.S.,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/girls-arent-meaner-than-boys-it-only-looks-that-way/

Rendered in saturated colors outlined in black, they operate in an area bounded by painting, cartooning, graffiti and perhaps video games. Mr. Grillo’s efforts bring new energy to the high-low graphic tradition that includes artists like Pierre Alechinsky, William Copley, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Sue Williams. However, a crazed retinal overload tends to distinguish Mr. Grillo’s works from those of his predecessors.

His repeating images of humble domestic objects — bottles, long-necked vases and little cookie tins set against expanses of empty wall and tabletop — can blend together and appear steeped in nostalgia.

2015-11-20,Vilhelm Hammershoi’s Paintings at Scandinavia House,"One of Denmark’s most celebrated artists, Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916), was known in his day as “the painter of tranquil rooms.” He worked during an era of great changes in Western art: Around the turn of the 20th century, traditional realism no longer seemed an adequate way to express the myriad revolutionary ideas percolating all over Europe. As viewers may observe in “Painting Tranquility: Masterworks by Vilhelm Hammershoi From SMK – The National Gallery of Denmark,” a beautiful small exhibition at Scandinavia House, his paintings convey a distinctively modern psychological complexity. But unlike another famous Scandinavian, the Expressionist Edvard Munch, Hammershoi practiced a kind of representational painting dating back to Rembrandt and Vermeer. With their severely muted colors, Hammershoi’s portraits and pictures of women in nearly empty rooms may call to mind the suavely subdued paintings of James McNeill Whistler. Although influenced by him, Hammershoi never pushed as far toward abstract abbreviation as Whistler.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/arts/design/vilhelm-hammershois-paintings-at-scandinavia-house.html

Can anybody picture Albom — whose heartwarming and slightly gooey best sellers include “Tuesdays With Morrie” and “The Five People You Meet in Heaven” — settling in for the night with, say, a dyspeptic Thomas Bernhard novel? Now Albom’s back with “The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto,” about a supernaturally gifted guitarist who influences musicians as diverse as Hank Williams and Wynton Marsalis and Kiss; it’s new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. A musician himself, Albom plays keyboards with the Rock Bottom Remainders, where his bandmates include Amy Tan on vocals and Stephen King on rhythm guitar, among assorted other best-selling authors. (“We mostly listen to Dave Barry telling booger jokes,” Albom has said.) “The theme I was trying to build on for this book was that everybody joins a band in life,” he told The Philadelphia Daily News this month. “Everyone joins a band. We may not think we do, but we do. Somebody plays the lead. Somebody is the rhythm. Somebody holds down the beat. Somebody gets to solo and go all over the place, while the other person gets stuck playing the chords. That’s pretty much how it is in a family. That’s how it is in the Army.

He has written eight previous books in which he fearlessly simulates identities dauntingly remote from his own — including the identities of real-life figures both dead and living — and in which plot performs a function that might fairly be described as redemptive. From the perspective of academic fashion it is a hoary, virtually benighted approach to narrative art; yet to judge by the enormous success of his work, most notably the panoramic novels “Let the Great World Spin” and “TransAtlantic,” its appeal to readers somehow endures.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/thirteen-ways-of-looking-by-colum-mccann.html

His narratives exist within that depressingly vast space between the hairsplitting nuances and abstractions of academia and the vulgar simplicities of cable news pundits. A highbrow out to educate middlebrows, Winchester writes books like someone telling a good yarn around the fireplace, whether about volcanoes, Indian slums or the 19th-century American West. He is an outdoorsman who knows about such things as geology and ocean sailing, which invigorates his prose in the same way as that of another journalistic travel writer, William Langewiesche, who flies planes and also sails. And he certainly has the knack for comparison. When Winchester writes that Hawaii, deep down, “in its perceived cultural essence,” still evokes what “was felt by Gauguin during his time in the Marquesas,” it is reminiscent of the British travel writer Jan Morris describing in 1960 how the smells and landscape of the Lido in Venice ignite thoughts of Carthage and Marrakesh.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/simon-winchesters-pacific.html

One imagines that this sensorial attachment to Paris was never stronger than in recent days, after the city suffered terrorist attacks that killed more than 120 people.

The very act of transferring the words of another into the brain activates the inner voice, the voice that we “hear” when we read to ourselves. All reading is therefore a vocal performance, generally just for an audience of one. Consider how much the language of reading and writing supports this notion: We talk about an author’s voice and tone and rhythm.

The Greek historian Polybius, writing in the second century B.C., was the first to ask the question: “Who could be so indifferent or so idle that they did not want to find out how, and under what kind of political organization, almost the whole of the inhabited world was conquered and fell under the sole power of the Romans in less than 53 years?” It was not as if Rome was a promising spot: a swampy piece of ground up a barely navigable river surrounded by scrubby hills, its few thousand inhabitants alternately flooded out and ravaged by malaria.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/mary-beards-spqr-and-tom-hollands-dynasty.html

So successful is the book in making readers identify with the author that it has never gone out of print and never seems to age.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/augustine-conversions-to-confessions-by-robin-lane-fox.html

It blended with and crashed against the preternatural wail of her bandmate, the guitarist Corin Tucker, backed with the insistent drums of Janet Weiss; three women making a noise we felt all through our bodies. Playing with them again, Brownstein writes in “Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl,” was like being home.

Vidal was a tireless self-mythologizer, and as his title suggests, that book is a layering of rememberings, re-rememberings and mis-rememberings. In his new, much sounder biography, “Empire of Self,” Jay Parini suggests that even the account of Vidal’s idyllic romance with his high school friend Jimmie Trimble, one of the touchstones of “Palimpsest” — the story of a love so perfect and unearthly that it could never be duplicated — was most likely a fabrication.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/empire-of-self-a-life-of-gore-vidal-by-jay-parini.html

He was arrested by Italian Fascists and turned over to the Germans, who sent him to Auschwitz — he called it the Lager, the German word for a concentration camp — where he survived partly by luck, partly because he was put to work in a synthetic-rubber factory that used prisoners as slave labor. Returning to Italy, he wrote his memoir of Auschwitz, “If This Is a Man” (1947), and worked 30 years for a paint factory while writing stories, poems, memoirs, essays, a novel and “The Periodic Table” (1975), his idiosyncratic autobiography in which each chapter was named for a chemical element and some chapters were short stories.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/the-complete-works-of-primo-levi.html

At a news conference on Tuesday, several cabinet ministers said that only 10,000 would arrive by the original deadline, with the balance coming by the end of February. “We want to bring them in fast, but we also want to do it right,” said John McCallum, the immigration minister. Mr. McCallum said the delay was not caused by security concerns after the recent attacks in Paris. Rather, he said, it related to preparing housing and services for the refugees, who will become permanent residents upon entry. Government officials said the selection process would favor families, women who are at risk and gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people. Single men will be admitted only if they fall under the sexual orientation categories or if they travel with their parents. About 36 cities have agreed to accept Syrian refugees who are to be flown to Canada by the military, which will also provide temporary accommodations for about 6,000 people at some of its bases.  ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/world/americas/canada-syrians-arrival-is-delayed-and-officials-cite-need-to-prepare.html

Paishon doesn’t know how to use a GPS device or a magnetic compass, but he can orient himself on land or sea with a glance at the heavens. Determine north by finding the North Star, which does not set when you’re north of the Equator. As seafarers have done for millenniums, you can determine about how many miles north of the Equator you are by measuring the distance between the North Star and the horizon. To do this, stretch out your arm. For most, one fist equals approximately 10 degrees; latitudinal degrees each represent about 69 miles. The farther north you go, the higher the star looks in the sky. South of the Equator, you won’t see the North Star but must rely on a constellation called the Southern Cross to help you find south.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars.html

2015-11-25,Mary Gaitskill’s ‘The Mare’,"Desire and damage have long intertwined, an inseparable couple, in the work of Mary Gaitskill. With her first collection of stories in 1988, “Bad Behavior,” Gaitskill staked out her territory: love, or something, among the ruins — the ruins of self, the ruins of hope, the ruins created by cruelty, both literal and psychological. In Gaitskill’s work, people hurt one another for fun, for spite, inadvertently, because they can, and (as she titled a later collection) because they wanted to. In one of Gaitskill’s most famous stories, “Secretary,” which later became a film of the same name, an alienated young woman is sexually used by her boss, but finds the encounter has an array of effects. She is simultaneously dissociated, disgusted, turned on, depressed, oddly loyal to the boss and somehow liberated. It is not right, and it also awakens something vital in her. Gaitskill’s story doesn’t prioritize one emotion over any others or draw any moral conclusions. As she wrote in a 1994 Harper’s essay, “On Not Being a Victim,” “pain can be an experience that defies codification.” In that story, as in much of Gaitskill’s work, the heroine’s ability to remain aware of all uncodifiable experience, to turn it over and examine it, is how she stays alive.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/mary-gaitskills-the-mare.html

But in 1955, it stopped making the wristwatches, which had become too elaborately wonkish to suit changing tastes. Although the company began gingerly reintroducing chronographs in the late 1980s, the final ’50s-era model, the Cornes de Vache, continued to obsess collectors. Only 36 were ever made: 26 in yellow gold, eight in rose gold and two in platinum. Now the company has reinterpreted the design. The Historiques Cornes de Vache 1955, available only in platinum, is, like the original, a sober classic distinguished by its cow-horn-shaped lugs. But a slightly wider face gives the watch a more modern, balanced look and feel. With its raised Roman numerals, midnight-blue alligator strap, sapphire-hued tachometric dial and clear crystal back, it makes keeping track of time an immeasurable pleasure.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/t-magazine/a-1950s-era-timepiece-reborn.html

In the highest diplomatic circles, it was said today that no signing of any agreement by either of the Axis powers with Bulgaria was likely soon.

In that case, the union of George VI and Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, was the foundation on which the tale of George’s elocutionary striving was built. Here, the marriage is bohemian rather than aristocratic, but the stakes, while personal, are every bit as profound and consequential as the matters of state that drove the monarch to the microphone.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/movies/review-the-danish-girl-about-a-transgender-pioneer.html

She urged every man, woman and child in this country to join the Red Cross and give $1.50 a year to help in this new movement for preparedness. Mr. Joseph H.

2015-11-27,1940: Students Clash in Zagreb,"BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — An incident that carries with it a heavy charge of political dynamite occurred in the Croatian university town of Zagreb today [Nov. 27] when extreme Croatian Nationalist students clashed with a group of ‘‘moderate’’ students supporting Dr. Vladko Matchek’s policy of co-operation with the Serbs. The fight, in which a number of students were seriously wounded, occurred on the occasion of a meeting held within the university by the extremist group, which favors independence for Croatia. The university was closed and guarded by the police so as to avoid a possible disturbance, but the ‘‘moderate’’ students — those favoring Yugoslav national unity — forced their way in through the cellar and tried to break up the meeting. The clash which ensued ended only when the police quickly restored order and made a number of arrests. The incident assumed special importance in view of Yugoslavia’s uncertain diplomatic relations with a number of her neighbors. The position of this country, nearly surrounded by potential foes, resembles that of Czecho-Slovakia in 1939. In the internal situation, too, there is a parallel. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 28, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/1940-students-clash-in-zagreb/
2015-11-27,Inside the List,"Killing Santa: Every year, around the time mall stores start playing “Frosty the Snowman” and Starbucks breaks out its red cups, the best-seller list hangs its stockings by the fire and waits for a visit from Richard Paul Evans. You know Evans: He’s the one whose self-published debut, “The Christmas Box,” sold something like eight million copies in the mid-1990s and landed him a fat contract with Simon & Schuster; since then, his cozy holiday-themed books have included “Finding Noel,” “The Christmas List,” “A Winter Dream” and “The Mistletoe Promise,” among others. Now he’s back, right on cue, with “The Mistletoe Inn,” new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 9. What draws Evans so repeatedly to Christmas? Readers prone to psychoanalyzing might find a clue on his website, where Evans describes the “tsunami of misfortune” that hit his family in 1970, the year he turned 8. “My father lost his job and couldn’t find work, and my mother began to exhibit the first signs of severe depression. My Tourette’s syndrome manifested that year and I was ticking like crazy. In addition, I wet the bed every night, made worse since I shared the bed with my brother,” he writes. “During this dark time I had a soul-crushing fourth-grade teacher named Mrs. Covey. I’ll never forget two weeks before Christmas when she ridiculed those of us who still believed in Santa with the words: ‘Your parents lied to you. There is no Santa.’ Crushed, I went home and asked my mother if she had lied. My mother frowned. She said, ‘Santa is the spirit of giving.’",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-11-30,1890: Germany’s Gift to the World,"BERLIN — Herr Von Gossler, the Minister of Public Instruction replied to-day [Nov. 29] in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies to the interpellation of Herr Graf relative to the discovery of Professor Koch. The Minister replied that Professor Koch’s discovery was for the present only an infallible means of diagnoses for tuberculosis, but that as a means of cure it would require years of experience to test it. There was, however, great hope that the results would be good. In any case Professor Koch has rendered an immense service to science in connection with all kinds of infectious diseases. The minister added that it was he who prevented Professor Koch from publishing the method of preparation of his remedy, for fear that it might be badly prepared and do more harm than good. The Prussian Government, he said, intended to purchase the secret and manufacture the remedy with its own guarantee, and supply it free of cost to all the hospitals of Germany and other countries. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 30, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/1890-germanys-gift-to-the-world/

Authoritative quarters were denied reports that the Greeks had captured Argyrokastron, one of the Italian bases in Albania, and that Gen. Pietro Badoglio had taken up headquarters in Tirana.

In 2011, the French tourism ministry humiliatingly left the Ritz off its list of ‘‘palaces’’ (a classification for five-star hotels of special character), compelling the hotel’s owner, Mohamed Al-Fayed, to upgrade. Now, after three years and an estimated $227 million renovation by the architect Thierry Despont, the 142-room Ritz is ready to reopen — complete with upgraded suites, a spacious new fitness center and, unsurprisingly, an untouched Bar Hemingway.

Planned Parenthood denied making sales, saying one of its 700 health centers was being reimbursed for supplying fetal tissue to researchers, who have used fetal cells to produce lifesaving vaccines and treatments. But the doctor caught on camera spoke in graphic medical terms while sipping wine over lunch, and the videos prompted five separate congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood’s practices. Testifying before a House committee in October, the group’s president, Cecile Richards, said it would continue facilitating the tissue donations, with patients’ consent, but stop accepting reimbursements.
