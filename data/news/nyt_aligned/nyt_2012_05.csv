2012-05-01,Texas: Judge Prevents Ban on Funds to Planned Parenthood,"A federal judge in Austin on Monday prevented Texas from enforcing a rule that would have banned Planned Parenthood from participating in a health care program for low-income women. Nine Planned Parenthood clinics sued the state, saying that the rule, requiring all those in the program to certify that they do not affiliate with entities that perform or promote abortions, was unconstitutional. The rule would have removed 49 Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas from the state’s so-called Medicaid Women’s Health Program beginning Tuesday. Judge Lee Yeakel ruled that by requiring the certification the state “is reaching beyond the scope of the government program and penalizing plaintiffs for their protected conduct.” The state attorney general, Greg Abbott, immediately appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to lift the injunction. A spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission said it would comply with the ruling.

The child of Episcopal missionaries with deep roots in colonial Massachusetts, Tyng was born in China and educated in Jiangxi Province and New York State. One winter while she was a student at the Kuling American School, she packed snow into wooden boxes to make ice blocks and built a high-domed igloo; the following spring, she constructed a circular bamboo hut as a secret hideout. In 1942, she enrolled in the first class to admit women at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer and readily embraced what she described as the “missionary zeal” of the Bauhaus-influenced faculty.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/t-magazine/anne-griswold-tyngs-tiny-house.html

2012-05-01,How Do Artists Say I Love You?,"“One of my favorite works of yours is to throw an object from one country to another, and I just want you to know that I’m taking all the love from my country and throwing it into yours,” said Ed Ruscha to his friend and fellow artist Lawrence Weiner via video last Tuesday night. The occasion was the Drawing Center’s 2012 Spring Gala, where Weiner was being honored for his contributions to contemporary art. Ruscha, who was on vacation in Jamaica, created a three-minute tribute in the form of a parody of Bob Dylan’s legendary music video for “Subterranean Homesick Blues” with placards featuring Weiner text pieces like “stars don’t stand still in the sky” and “water in milk exists.” The mash-up soundtrack, sung by Ruscha himself, was composed by the longtime Ruscha collaborator Mason Williams, while the film was shot in Ruscha’s studio by Gary Regester, another old friend. Weiner and Ruscha both showed at Leo Castelli’s gallery in the 1970s and even teamed up for a book, “Hard Light,” in 1978, so there’s a deep personal history far beyond benefit-circuit sendups. “At the end of the video,” commented Brett Littman, the executive director of the Drawing Center, “Ed begs Lawrence’s wife, Alice, to bring him into the 21st century by teaching him how to drive a car, but Lawrence is a true New Yorker and I don’t think honorees are expected to do homework.” See the video here.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/how-do-artists-say-i-love-you/

2012-05-01,Eight Things I Learned From Reading Every Last Word of Bloomberg BusinessWeek,"I’m slightly embarrassed to admit that my baseline understanding of private equity comes mainly from movies (“Wall Street,” “Pretty Woman,” “Other People’s Money”) in which the profession is used as shorthand to tell audiences that a character is really, really, really bad. Despite the chainsaw-wielding corporate evildoer on the cover of this week’s Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the magazine presents a much kinder, gentler version of private equity. The corporate restructuring artists here are like fairy godmothers who show up to organize your closet and teach you a few time-saving life hacks.

But just how connected even they couldn’t be so sure until they reached out to 100 of their cultural heroes and, using a Playbutton as a platform, loaded their words of wisdom, favorite songs and even the occasional recipe onto the wearable MP3 devices. The artist Cindy Sherman, who claimed not to like public speaking, curated a playlist; the legendary art director George Lois read from his new book, “Damn Good Advice“; Pharrell Williams rapped philosophic on his personal otherness (his new record label is called I Am Other). Starting tonight, and for the next three weeks, 10 different MP3 buttons will be available to the listening public at the New Museum Store as part of CNNCTD+100. Additional buttons have been planted throughout the city at special Sound Graffiti stations. (Hint: the Jason Woodside mural on Kenmare Street between Bowery and Elizabeth has something to say for itself.) Cornejo Borthwick and Grandinetti’s plan is to take the project global, bringing the buttons — and their collective good will — to cities like Paris and Tokyo and adding new names to the roster along the way. “In New York City people are always so competitive,” Cornejo Borthwick observes. “The way to succeed is to collaborate.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/finger-on-the-button/

Nine Planned Parenthood clinics that do not perform abortions sued the state. On Monday, Judge Lee Yeakel of Federal District Court blocked the state from enforcing the rule, but the state attorney general appealed, and Judge Jerry E. Smith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay of the order. As a result, state health officials said on Tuesday that they had begun banning all abortion providers and affiliates from the program.

The request said Libyan authorities were making progress in investigating the cases and preparing for trials that will meet international standards. In Mr. Qaddafi’s case, witnesses have been interviewed and evidence of his “direct involvement in killings” has emerged, the document said.

2012-05-02,Daughters of the Revolution,"Last week, Tyler Cowen tweeted that the second episode of HBO’s endlessly-discussed new show “Girls” is “very … Douthatian. If you are a Straussian, that is.” By “Douthatian” I’m assuming that he meant implicitly socially conservative, and now that I’ve caught up with the show, I think if anything its critique of contemporary (New York, upper middle class, white) sexual mores is explicit rather than esoteric. Indeed, before the conversation about “Girls” descended into a pointless argument about whether racial minorities are adequately represented on a program that’s clearly supposed to be portraying a narrow and privileged slice of American life, the critical reaction to the show, both positive and negative, grasped pretty directly what Lena Dunham’s show is doing. It’s offering a fairly dystopian take on twentysomething social life, in which the comedy is dark, the sex is gross, the romance is disappointing, and the mix of nudity, jadedness and bawdy talk doesn’t carry any of the aspirational frisson that was always associated with the post-sexual revolution single life on a show like “Sex and the City.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/daughters-of-the-revolution/

The rolling strike, which would not take place until the fall, would be the largest faculty strike in the state’s history and would take place over two days at each campus, ultimately affecting more than 400,000 students. The state has cut roughly $970 million from the California State University system since 2008, and university officials have responded by lowering the number of students admitted and raising tuition 23 percent.

2012-05-03,South Korea: North Accused of Sending Jamming Signals to Disrupt GPS," South Korean government officials accused North Korea on Wednesday of sending out jamming signals in an apparent attempt to disrupt civilian and military air and ground traffic in the South, forcing 252 commercial flights to switch off their GPS devices. The North has tried to sabotage South Korea’s use of GPS, widely employed in air, sea and ground navigation, at least three times since 2010, the Korea Communications Commission said. The commission said the latest jamming began Saturday, after North Korea’s recent warnings of “special actions” to attack the government of President Lee Myung-bak in South Korea and the South’s conservative news media, which the North accuses of insulting its leadership.

2012-05-03,U.N. Resolution Threatens Sanctions Against Sudan and South Sudan," The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution on Wednesday threatening Sudan and South Sudan with sanctions if they failed to halt escalating cross-border fighting that was called a “serious threat to international peace.” The resolution demanded the nations resume negotiations on fraught issues like oil sharing to try to stop the violence. Russia and China, which have resisted voting against Sudan in the past, joined in the unanimous passage of the resolution. The resolution also called for both nations to remove their forces from Abyei, arguably the most iconic of numerous contested regions along the border. Last month, hostilities heated up when South Sudan captured the oil-rich region of Heglig from Sudan. It later withdrew, after Sudanese airstrikes and pressure from the international community, but clashes between the two nations continue along the border, as well as inside South Sudan’s territory.

A commission delegation that visited the prison and two others late last month concluded that the “most worrisome” problem in Honduras’s prisons was that the authorities had effectively ceded control to the prisoners themselves, in part because guards were not properly trained.  This “has led to high levels of violence and corruption, in a context of absolute impunity,” the commission said. The delegation also found severe overcrowding, as well as unsafe housing and inadequate food, water and medical care.

He is outfitted thus in a series of images taken by the Italian photographer Ugo Mulas in 1964. Showing the artist in his studio calmly cutting one of his long signature slashes in a pristine canvas, they give a restrained, dignified start to the extraordinary exhibition of Fontana’s work at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea.

2012-05-04,Britain: Ex-Officials in Murdoch Empire to Face Questions in Hacking Inquiry," Two former executives at Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloid newspapers, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, will give evidence to a public inquiry next week, according to schedules released Thursday. Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials. Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron. She has been arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice. The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links — described by critics as improperly cozy — between Mr. Murdoch’s media empire and Mr. Cameron’s government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in a public office” as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into the payments to public officials, the police said. The arrest was made, the police said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.

Which is why an event like the “Translation Slam” Thursday night, part of this year’s PEN World Voices literary festival, must be a translator’s delight, a rare opportunity to stand in the spotlight — in this case literally.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/translators-get-a-slam-of-their-own-at-pen-festival/

2012-05-04,"Easy China, 3 Ways","FOR the first-time visitor to China, planning a trip to the most populous country on earth can be an exercise in trying to tame the infinite. Where to begin? Since most people will be flying into Beijing, Hong Kong or Shanghai, we suggest basing yourself in one of these three cities, each in its own state of frenzied transformation. As two Times correspondents, David Barboza in Shanghai and Keith Bradsher in Hong Kong, and Dan Levin, a regular contributor from Beijing point out, each city is a study in contrasts. Dazzling, ultramodern skylines conceal hidden corners of traditional China: historic neighborhoods crisscrossed by alleyways in Beijing; teahouses in Shanghai; and centuries-old temples in Hong Kong. Which isn’t to say that these metropolises, with their up-to-the-minute shops, galleries, restaurants and bars don’t possess their own magic. They do.

One is unlikely to hear any mention of another, equally famous Derby (pronounced “Darby”) taking place a month later at Epsom Downs in England. Unlike its Kentucky counterpart, the Epsom Derby, the subject of an intricately plotted and stylistically burnished crime caper by the English writer D. J. Taylor, is run on turf, over uneven terrain.

In the poster, he beholds a distraught goddess, naked but for the merest scrap of filmy gauze, who recoils from a glowering serpent, “cowering, hands pressed to her sizable breasts, cupping them protectively.” She is “young, beautiful, vulnerable,” he thinks as he stares at the poster, “confronted by some squamous, no doubt phallic monster about to ravish her.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/waiting-for-sunrise-by-william-boyd.html

Here, she thought, was a path between a life cut short and one painfully prolonged — a death (for late-stage ovarian cancer is almost invariably fatal) in her 60s, when her daughters were grown and she was happy in her second marriage and her work.

She’s no celebrated “grande horizontale,” even though she shares the name of France’s empress — and even though one of her lovers makes her famous with a painting that wins a prize in the Salon of 1861.

Yet when I look at journals like The Point and n+1 and Triple Canopy; at The Believer and Granta and The New Yorker; at the Kindle Singles and longreads.com and even at what gets passed around on Twitter, I see a robust demand for, and supply of, long-form “magazine writing.” And in just the last few years, a cohort of younger writers including Elif Batuman, Wells Tower, Sam Anderson and John Jeremiah Sullivan has emerged to put its distinctive stamp on the genre.

2012-05-04,And Then There Were 39,"“A singular disadvantage of the sea,” Stephen Crane wrote in his 1897 story “The Open Boat,” based on his experiences on a lifeboat off the coast of Florida, “lies in the fact that after successfully surmounting one wave you discover that there is another behind it just as important.” The unrelenting sea and its vast indifference to the shipwrecked is a subject that has always attracted both writers and readers. We are fascinated, and appalled, by how quickly men and women are brought to a childlike state, curled in tight on themselves and unable to call on their own free will, sanity or morality. Most riveting of all, perhaps, is the tension that emerges between extreme emotional and physical reduction and an expanded, even predatory, desire to survive.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/the-lifeboat-charlotte-rogans-first-novel.html

2012-05-04,Inside the List,"I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY NECK: The former New York Times Op-Ed columnist Anna Quindlen has been a steady presence on the best-seller lists since she quit newspapers for novel-writing in 1995, and this week her new book about graceful aging, “Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake,” storms the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 2. To judge from an interview she gave last year, Quindlen — unlike Nora Ephron — isn’t one to feel bad about her neck as she stares down her 60s. “After a number of years working on it very, very hard with my trainer, I now can stand on my head,” she told Kathy Patrick, a Texas hairstylist who owns a combination bookstore and beauty shop (a literary salon!) called Beauty and the Book. “And I’m pretty proud of that,” Quindlen continued. “The fact that I couldn’t stand on my head when I was 22, and I can now that I’m 58, is something that I take a lot of pride in. . . . I think when you’re over 50, you get less and less and less fearful of things, because you understand that, you know, what’s the worst that can happen if you try and fail? So my experience is that most of the women I know over 50 really don’t give a rip what anybody thinks anymore. And it means that they wind up taking chances they might not have taken when they were 25, and doing things they might not have tried. And I think that’s one reason why I feel really good about where I am right now.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/books/review/inside-the-list.html

His reign was brief, circa 1336-1327 B.C. Historians had previously known so little about him that they were not sure if he had died young or come to the throne as an old man. But the sight of his golden death mask provoked a media frenzy, and the wild conjecture has continued down to our time of high-tech studies of the Tut mummy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/tutankhamen-by-joyce-tyldesley.html

Barney, born Barnet Lee Rosset Jr., was, in my father’s eyes, the black sheep of the family. The renegade, the ne’er-do-well, the ungrateful son. He’d purchased a failing publishing company called Grove Press. He was squandering his father’s fortune. He was a Communist and a pornographer.

2012-05-04,On Their Stomachs,"Calories were made to be counted, but they have generally been counted for two very different reasons. We associate calories with excess, but for most of its history this little unit of energy was linked to shortage. The years since World War II have been a time of cheap and plentiful food, and of obese and sick citizens. Since our own daily struggle is fought against fat, we fail to see that many of the conflicts of the past were wars against hunger. Just as obesity leads to diabetes and human blindness, so plentiful food leads to decadent forms of history and social blindness. We are fortunate to have a bracing book like “The Taste of War,” which does much to correct understanding of the causes of armed conflict and mass murder.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/the-taste-of-war-by-lizzie-collingham.html

2012-05-04,Who Made That Frisbee?,"Walter Fredrick Morrison and his girlfriend, Lucile Nay, discovered that flying discs were marketable when a stranger asked to buy the metal cake pan they were flipping through the air on a Santa Monica beach. By 1938, the couple were selling the 5-cent pans for a quarter a piece. Morrison used the proceeds to buy Nay a $35 diamond engagement ring. After a stint as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, Morrison tried his hand at developing “a flying disk far superior to that of a flying cake pan.” Together with a butane supplier named Warren Franscioni, they created the Flyin-Saucer, but it didn’t go very far until Morrison created a new version in 1955, dubbed the Pluto Platter. The disc had a bump that evoked an alien cockpit on top and the names of the planets around its rim. Wham-O, the visionary toy company known for its slingshots and, soon, its Hula-Hoops, bought the rights in 1957. Wham-O renamed the flying disc Frisbee, which Morrison didn’t like one bit. “Had I been consulted, I’d have vehemently objected,” he wrote in his account of the Frisbee business (written with Phil Kennedy),“Flat Flip Flies Straight!” Wham-O went on to nix the alien cockpit and planetary names, opting instead for a new, sportier disc with a stripe in the center and the words “Official Pro Model” on top. By the mid-1960s, “there was one of everybody’s roof,” says Robert Rauch, president of the World Flying Disc Federation. The Frisbee was, quite simply, “cool,” says Tim Walsh, author of a book on Wham-O. “This thing rose on the wind.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/magazine/who-made-that-frisbee.html

And then comes a close-up of the show’s host and star, Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela, usually dressed in all red or a military jacket, sometimes crowned with a Che-style beret, standing on the road among his supporters or before a live audience at Miraflores Palace in Caracas. The show is entirely unscripted. Chávez usually begins by stating the date and saying, “Aló Presidente!” then grinning and giving himself a round of applause. “Aló Presidente!” he repeats and you can’t tell if he’s introducing the program by its title or simply greeting and congratulating himself.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/magazine/hugo-chavezs-totally-bizarre-talk-show.html

Even taking into account that unusually warm winter weather probably distorted the recent results, the underlying trend shows an economy that has been creating about 175,000 jobs a month — enough to keep the recovery crawling along, but too weak to appreciably raise hiring or wages.

2012-05-07,CBS Threatens ABC Over Reality Show,"Lawsuits over copycatting in reality television have gone nowhere in the past, but CBS has suggested to ABC that it may consider one over a summer show called “Glass House.” The format is similar to CBS’s long-running summer series “Big Brother,” and ABC has hired many former production members from that show. On Friday CBS sent a sternly worded letter to ABC about it. The letter implies, without directly saying so, that CBS will sue ABC over copyright infringement. The letter said that CBS was “putting ABC on notice that its continued development and production of ‘Glass House’ exposes ABC to liability.” The letter said the elements of the new show are “substantially and strikingly” similar to “Big Brother.” In “Glass House,” which has its debut on June 18, 14 people are chosen to live in a house all summer with cameras on them in pursuit of a cash prize — the essence of “Big Brother” competition. In the past copyright cases have proved nearly impossible for reality-show plaintiffs to win because, in simple terms, everybody’s reality is inherently different. The total number of former staff members on “Glass House” is at least 18, according to the CBS letter, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements when they worked for “Big Brother.” The CBS letter argued that it would be impossible for anyone who signed such a letter to help produce a similar show without breaching the agreement. ABC had yet to respond to the CBS letter or requests for comment by Sunday afternoon.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/arts/television/cbs-threatens-abc-over-reality-show.html

2012-05-07,Now Playing | The World Premiere of Bonnie Prince Billy’s New Music Video,"Will Oldham is often described as prolific, and with good reason. The singer-songwriter of many monikers — he has recorded music as the Palace Brothers, Palace Music, Palace Songs and Bonnie Prince Billy, among other names — has seldom gone a year without releasing a record in almost two decades. He has also been known to rerecord his old songs, making instrument-packed renditions of what were spare arrangements and turning dark, slow ballads into light, country-inflected numbers. To coincide with his new book, “Will Oldham on Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy,” Oldham is again releasing a new batch of his own oldies — a six-song EP called “Now Here’s My Plan,” made up of fresh versions of songs from the Prince Billy catalog. Among the recordings, available on July 24 at Drag City, is an impossibly upbeat rendition of “I See a Darkness,” the beautifully bleak song off his 1999 album of the same name that was later covered by Johnny Cash. To Ben Berman, who directed the music video for the new version, above, the buoyant rendition is not incongruous with the song’s subject matter. “To me the song is about friendship,” Berman says, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. “It’s about a person who is dark and morose and maybe unhappy in his life but who has a friend who makes it all worthwhile.” There wasn’t much of a planned concept for the video, Berman says, but the result was something of a study in contrasts: black-and-white photography in cinematic Glasgow, Scotland, plus goofball dance moves and special effects that make Oldham’s and his band members’ eyes swirl around in opposing directions like stick-on googly eyes. “We share a similar sensibility for what we find bizarrely funny,” Berman says. “He’s the perfect amount of weird.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/now-playing-the-world-premiere-of-bonnie-prince-billys-new-music-video/

If an intern performs well, it seems natural for the employer to offer a regular, permanent job. But if the intern is not up to snuff, it is much less painful to let the person go after three months than to lay off a recently hired regular employee after three months. That latter course not only hurts the worker, but also helps give the employer a reputation as an undesirable place to work.",Business Day,https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/the-uses-and-misuses-of-unpaid-internships/

Mr. Fairey, a longtime fan of the musician, included him in “May Day,” his 2010 show at Deitch Projects portraying cultural heroes of the left. Then Mr. Young, who stages an annual benefit concert for the Bridge School in Northern California, asked Mr. Fairey to create art for an album marking the concert’s 25th anniversary. So the artist wasn’t exactly surprised, he said at the opening of his new show at Pace Prints, when Mr. Young asked him to make a painting representing each song in his new album with Crazy Horse, “Americana.” What Mr. Fairey didn’t expect was the intensity of Mr. Young’s involvement. For all the tracks, the artist submitted several digital mockups inspired by the narrative (none based on an identifiable original source, he emphasized). Then Mr. Young picked his favorites. Mr. Fairey said he was also surprised to learn that “God Save the Queen” is not just a Sex Pistols song but an old British anthem and the source of the melody for “My Country ’Tis of Thee.” His finished painting depicts the Queen and Betsy Ross sewing a combination of British and American flags; its text reads “God save the land of liberty”— a phrase with both a dual origin and a double meaning. “Neil and I talked about that,” Mr. Fairey said. “They left England, and basically made the same mistakes.

Just check out the clown as he appeared in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. (One of the pleasures to come from reading Keith O’Brien’s article about the company in last weekend’s magazine was the inspiration to start looking up old McDonald’s commercials on YouTube.)

2012-05-08,Jungle Gym,"In the Costa Rican jungle near the village of Cabuya — past a bridge, through a series of wooden gates and up an unmarked trail — sits a new yoga retreat, the Sanctuary at Two Rivers. Founded by the actress Perrey Reeves, who played the very yoga-fit Mrs. Ari Gold on HBO’s “Entourage,” and Jeff Gossett, a restaurateur, the solar-powered resort was built completely by hand: no bulldozers, only shovels. “When you cook with a lot of love, you taste it; when you build with a lot of love, you can feel it,” Gossett says of their decade-long project. (And when you plant with a lot of love, evidently, you can smell it: the orchids blooming right outside the showers are no accident, he adds.) Visitors can either sign up for one of the Sanctuary’s regularly scheduled packages, like the weeklong Full-Moon Retreat, or rent out the entire 40-acre property for a private yogi gathering. The “accessible, eco-conscious and peaceful” country of Costa Rica, Reeves says, was the only place where the pair considered breaking ground. “Plus, there are monkeys!”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/jungle-gym/

2012-05-08,Stone Links: Dissecting the Dismal Science,"“What To Do About the Rich,” a post at the Philosopher’s Beard, offers a unique approach to the problem of the 1 percent. Capitalism is salvageable, the author argues, as long as we’re willing to consider a modest proposal: getting rid of the rich. Asserting that, because their extreme economic independence from the rest of society leads to a de facto ethical independence, “the rich don’t have the same political interests as the rest of us”, the author concludes that “no-one can be both a member of our democratic society and rich.” The solution? Once an individual reaches a certain threshold of democratically “problematic” wealth, they have a choice: give it back, for example to the charity or social program of their choice, and rejoin the rest of the broad middle class, or, leave the country, which the author points out shouldn’t be much of an issue for the extremely wealthy, who have the ability to, and often do, maintain multiple residences across the globe.

More recently, Lawrence Krauss, in his book, “A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing,” has insisted that “philosophy and theology are incapable of addressing by themselves the truly fundamental questions that perplex us about our existence.” David Albert, a distinguished philosopher of science, dismissively reviewed Krauss’s book: “all there is to say about this [Krauss’s claim that the universe may have come from nothing], as far as I can see, is that Krauss is dead wrong and his religious and philosophical critics are absolutely right.” Krauss — ignoring Albert’s Ph.D. in theoretical physics — retorted in an interview that Albert is a “moronic philosopher.” (Krauss somewhat moderates his views in a recent Scientific American article.)",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/can-physics-and-philosophy-get-along/

Some of those songs have titles that don’t scan well in a family newspaper, including Loudon’s ditty about a fight for position at the breast of Rufus’s mother and Martha’s profane rocket aimed at her father’s shortcomings.

From 1852 to 1887, the U.S. patent office issued 146 separate patents for clothespins. The first design that resembles the modern clothespin was patented in 1853 by David M. Smith, a prolific Vermont inventor. Smith also invented a combination lock, a “lathe dog” (a machine part for shaping metal) and a lifting spring for matchboxes. His “spring-clamp for clothes-lines” offered an elegant model of “two levers” hinged so that “the two longer legs may be moved toward each other and at the same time move the shorter ones apart.” Smith’s design was later improved by the 1887 patent of another Vermont inventor, Solon E. Moore, whose great contribution was the “coiled fulcrum,” made from a single wire, which joined the two grooved pieces of wood at the center of the clothespin. Moore’s version had the advantage of being both sturdy — it kept clothes securely on the line — and easy to manufacture.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/who-made-that-clothespin.html

Fascism may belong to the 20th century, but Franco’s grab for power evokes earlier times: the parading soldiers who flourished enemy ears and noses on their bayonets, the mass public executions carried out in bullrings or with band music and onlookers dancing in the victims’ blood. One of Franco’s top aides talked of democratically chosen politicians as “cloven-hoofed beasts,” and anything that smacked of modernity — Rotary Clubs, Montessori schools — seemed to draw the regime’s violent wrath. Echoing the Inquisition, Franco ordered particularly despised foes put to death with the garrote, in which the executioner tightens an iron collar around a person’s neck.

Why Towel Day? Because a towel, as readers of Adams’s delirious novel will remember, “is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.” (Suggested uses: beach-lounging on Santraginus V, sailing a miniraft down the River Moth, hiding from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal and, “if it still seems to be clean enough,” drying yourself off.) The tribute caught on, and this year people in at least 15 countries will observe May 25 by carrying towels to readings, movie screenings and other events related to “The Hitchhiker’s Guide,” which spent a cumulative 11 weeks on our paper­back list. In 1981, when the first American edition was released, Gerald Jonas praised it in the Book Review. “Humorous science-fiction novels have notoriously limited audiences,” he wrote. “They tend to be full of ‘in’ jokes understandable only to those who read everything from Jules Verne to Harlan Ellison.

It’s easy to navigate, and has a direct connection to Victoria Station.Molly Robertson,Taos, N.M.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/travel/letters-to-the-travel-editor.html
2012-05-11,Boy Blogs World,"Is Mad magazine dangerous? As a kid I thought so, reading every issue cover to cover in my local drugstore and then spending a significant portion of my allowance anyway because the owner once yelled at me for attempting a fold-in-and-run. I didn’t mind: those issues were worth the $1.35 (cheap!) to bring home and parse talmudically, seeking to understand, at age 11, the parodies of “Tootsie” and “Aliens”; trying to glean some idea of adulthood from Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions; blissing out to ribald drawings of nearly unclothed ladies.

Ella’s family is broken all right, in all the ways we might expect a plucky and preternaturally mature narrator’s family to be broken, and then some. Sick/absent/dead parent? Check, double check. Her mother has leukemia — Extreme Cancer, Ella calls it — and is about to have a stem cell transplant. Her father, who works as a guide at an outdoor travel adventure company, has literally gone fishing, as he has for most of Ella’s childhood. (Her cellphone’s ring tone for him is “Nowhere Man.”) An only child, she has no memories of her parents together. “When people divorce, the situation is bad but not a complete disaster,” she explains. “The kids eventually get stepparents and maybe half siblings, back-and-forth schedules between houses and divided-up vacations. We had a lot of that in Santa Rosa. But when we Mackenzies do things, we do them all the way.

Cameras, both still and video, had already been set up and there was a circle of chairs waiting, but they made sure they had all hugged and welcomed each other before taking a seat. There was very little tension and subtext as they settled in, much more of it when the recorder came on, and then none of it once they had finished. The Wainwrights and Roches know how to reveal just enough conflict to make for an interesting interview, but nothing that creates lasting grudges. When the group interview was done, three generations, siblings and half-siblings, grandpa and shy grandchild, all began weighing in on where the gigantic crew might eat. This is a family that likes and loves each other very much, even if they don’t always pretend to get along.

The agency said the driver had intended to bomb Aleppo’s densely populated Al Shaar neighborhood a day after two suicide bombers killed at least 55 people in Damascus. Syrian officials say the attacks vindicate their contention that President Bashar al-Assad’s foes are foreign-backed terrorists, while opposition figures say the government is trying to scare people.

The number of United Nations truce monitors on the ground in Syria has now reached nearly half the planned total of 300, the chief United Nations spokesman, Martin Nesirky, said Friday.

2012-05-14,Logic and Neutrality,"Here’s an idea many philosophers and logicians have about the function of logic in our cognitive life, our inquiries and debates. It isn’t a player. Rather, it’s an umpire, a neutral arbitrator between opposing theories, imposing some basic rules on all sides in a dispute. The picture is that logic has no substantive content, for otherwise the correctness of that content could itself be debated, which would impugn the neutrality of logic.

(The guide’s cover art was created by Marc Jacobs’s inker of choice, Scott Campbell, who works in Williamsburg.) What struck Sabas most, though, is the borough’s wide-spreading reputation for dishing up stylishly straightforward food: “I keep thinking of the words ‘epicurean chic,’ something I previously identified with Europeans in the 1970s,” she says. Among the restaurants that made Sabas’s cut: James in Prospect Heights, Roman’s in Fort Greene, Cafe Colette in Williamsburg and Dressler (which I personally recommended for its gorgeous dining room and elegant cocktails). But it’s more than just a listing of hip eateries. The guide also spotlights Brooklyn’s best yoga studios (Greenhouse Holistic and Shala), florists (Sprout Home and Saipua), vintage boutiques (Bogart & Moore and Erie Basin) and car services (Northside), which are handy when bridge-hopping back to Manhattan, if you must.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/bookshelf-the-brooklyn-of-fashion-insiders/

Among the rebuilt populations are the Bering Sea snow crab, the summer flounder along the mid-Atlantic, the haddock in the Gulf of Maine, the Chinook salmon along the Northern California coast, the coho salmon off Washington State and the Pacific widow rockfish, the Fisheries Service said.

The show will start previews on July 12, direct from a 13-city national tour — a rare example of a production that played in Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Toronto before coming to New York, where musicals usually begin before going on the road. The show was created by several Tony Award-winning artists: the music is by Tom Kitt (“Next to Normal”) and Lin-Manuel Miranda (“In the Heights”), with lyrics by Mr. Miranda and Amanda Green and a book by Jeff Whitty (“Avenue Q”). Andy Blankenbuehler, who won a Tony for choreography for “In the Heights,” is the director and choreographer.

Using a 10-foot depression created during construction of the adjacent Orchestra Hall, Mr. Friedberg, a Modernist landscape architect based in New York, built a terraced amphitheaterlike space and a drainable reflecting pool that could be used as a stage in summer and a skating rink in winter. Waterfalls absorbed noise; garden rooms offered intimacy and softened concrete edges. In 1999 the American Society of Landscape Architects recognized the plaza as one of the nation’s most significant examples of landscape architecture, along with Central Park in Manhattan and the Biltmore estate in North Carolina.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/arts/design/minneapolis-tussles-over-peavey-plaza.html

Excellent wine is everywhere, including downtown Napa, where 20 wine bars and tasting rooms have opened in the last decade.

Which is no big surprise — methods that calm touring musicians’ frantic lives have wide relevance in a place like Manhattan. The experience of renovating the studio’s West Village space brought Neufeld back around to music. “I would come home covered in sawdust and stress and play violin,” she says. “People asked me to tour and without thinking about it too much I said yes.

But for designers working under such confining conditions, Signorile and Cohen — who collaborate on the brand Fredericks & Mae — are unusually drawn to objects that fly; since they began working together in 2008, the duo have offered up arrows, glider planes and even a delicate set of handcrafted wings, made of chicken and macaw feathers and silk. (Among their more terrestrial objects are oversize strands of worry beads and a lovely wooden backgammon set.) The diamond kites the pair will be showing at Matter during the ICFF make perfect sense, then, given their attraction to the aerial.

The interracial crowd is a few hundred strong and drawn from nearly every stratum of local life — bikers, college kids, workingmen, toughs, gentlemen farmers. And then there are a couple dozen like me: urban cosmopolites eager to hear the deepest roots of the blues. Tamke calls himself “a redneck,” and he’s attacked me because I’m from The New York Times. Shouting into my ear over the music, Tamke makes me his megaphone for what he wants the outside world to know: “Our races have melded together, we share everything,” he says, voice trembling. “We love each other.” He’s squeezing my skull so hard it feels like it might pop, and it’s clear that he’s under the influence of something very powerful. The moonshine or the music, I don’t know. Finally, when it seems something is about to crack — my neck, or Tamke’s tenuous hold on sanity, or both — he lets me go. “It’s sacred,” he says, choking up. “It’s ancient, man.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/t-magazine/mississippi-blues-travelers.html

2012-05-18,Where Shoes Listen and Coins Kill,"In 1953, after the early successes of Soviet espionage demonstrated just how difficult and dangerous the cold war would become, the Central Intelligence Agency began a top-secret program called MKUltra. It included exotic projects that decades later provided much critical fodder for commentators and comedians: exploding cigars, poison-laced toothpaste, hallucinogenic serums. And as we learn in a video interview with professional spies at the exhibition “Spy: The Secret World of Espionage,” opening on Friday at Discovery Times Square, it even included the hiring of a magician, John Mulholland, as a C.I.A. consultant.

2012-05-18,Mattila Bows Out From Met Production,"Karita Mattila, the Finnish soprano, has dropped out of a new production of Verdi’s “Ballo in Maschera” at the Metropolitan Opera planned for next season, the Met said on Thursday. Ms. Mattila, right, was to have sung the role of Amelia. “Karita was engaged for ‘Ballo’ five years ago, and she recently decided the role was not right for her,” said a Met spokeswoman, Lee Abrahamian. Sondra Radvanovsky will take on all but 1 of the 10 Amelia performances, the Met said, with the other replacement to be determined. As part of the domino effect in opera casting Ms. Radvanovsky stepped out of four performances of Verdi’s “Trovatore,” and Carmen Giannattasio will take over for her. Ms. Radvanovsky was also released by the Met from her contract to sing Elisabeth de Valois in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” in February and March because she now needs more time to prepare for future roles, the company said. No replacement was named. The announcements were part of a barrage of cast comings and goings for next year. The Met also said that Erwin Schrott would sing Dulcamara in Donizetti’s “Elisir d’Amore,” a new production of the opera directed by Bartlett Sher, and that Dolora Zajick would replace Olga Borodina in three performances of “Aida.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/mattila-bows-out-from-met-production/

2012-05-18,Giverny Blooms in the Bronx,"The market for Claude Monet’s paintings faltered in the 1880s but came back the following decade, when he started producing series like the haystacks and the Rouen Cathedral facades. He began to make a lot of money, enough to finance his own private utopia in Giverny in northern France, where he devoted himself to flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did to painting. From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, initially as a renter, he presided over his aesthetic Eden, his paradise for the innocent eye, and there created some of the most adventurous works on canvas of the early 20th century: the enveloping, hallucinatory paintings of lily pads floating on the surface of the pond he excavated for them.

2012-05-18,Pacifists in the Cross-Fire,"Several miles west of Kabul, the village Qala-e Naw sits deep in the barren foothills of barrener mountains that are perennially half-sunk in cloud. The ruins of old homes strafed by Soviet gunships crowd a gravel streambed that is dry most of the year but runs swiftly with snowmelt come spring. One morning early in December, a 12-year-old girl named Gulali followed the bed for almost an hour, along with her mother and little sister, in search of dry timber to fuel their stove. When they reached a steep rise with scattered saplings near its peak, Gulali scrambled up the slope and set to hacking at some of the skinnier trunks with a hatchet. In the small community of poor Pashtun farmers who inhabit Qala-e Naw, Gulali was well liked for her prideful and precocious work ethic, and true to form, when her mother said they had enough wood and it was time to go home, Gulali insisted on felling one last tree. Seconds later, she stepped on a land mine.

Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon studying the “physiology of rapid deceleration,” wanted to test his rocket sled on something resembling a human. He commissioned a dummy based on plaster casts of an actual pilot. A California firm called Sierra Engineering responded with Sierra Sam, a six-foot-tall steel-and-rubber dummy with instruments in his thorax and head. Soon, it became apparent that such a dummy could have a big impact on the auto industry. With the birth of the Interstate, in 1956, Americans began driving longer distances in bigger and more powerful cars, increasing concerns about safety. In 1965, Ralph Nader published “Unsafe at Any Speed,” and the following year Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The same year, the engineer Samuel Alderson, who studied physics under J. Robert Oppenheimer, built the first dummy designed for the automotive industry.

Instead they were in Jay’s garage-turned-office in Los Angeles, preparing for a sound-looping session for their microbudget movie, “The Do-Deca-Pentathlon,” and generally acting like stoned teenagers in faded black jeans. Jay rooted through cardboard boxes, searching for microphones. Mark watched, strumming an acoustic guitar.

2012-05-18,Things Left Unsaid,"“I would like you to write a simple story just once more,” a dying man says to his daughter in Grace Paley’s “Conversation With My Father.” He asks that she, like Maupassant or Chekhov, create “recognizable people and then write down what happened to them next.” The nine stories in Johanna Skibsrud’s first collection, “This Will Be Difficult to Explain,” could have been written with this mandate in mind. In them, young women stumble through summer jobs abroad, wives toy with leaving their husbands, and fathers labor to communicate with sullen teenage daughters. Her characters live in South Dakota and California, in unnamed suburbs, rural towns and far-flung capitals that, if unrecognizable in detail, are familiar in mood. What links these stories, aside from a handful of recurring characters, is their fascination with the mundane, with the instances in which the known becomes foreign or the everyday exposes a sinister architecture.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/this-will-be-difficult-to-explain-by-johanna-skibsrud.html

2012-05-18,Loving Liberals,"The trouble with liberals, Robert Kennedy complained in 1964, was that they were “in love with death” — they romanticized failure, finding greater nobility in losing the whole loaf than in winning half of it. In the years since then, liberals have not only lost a lot of loaves but have acquired a mess of other troubles, among them the difficulty of getting anyone to admit to being a liberal. To wear the label today seems an act of defiance, much as members of the gay rights community have appropriated, from their antagonists, the epithet “queer.” Liberalism — for decades (centuries, even) the prevailing philosophy in American political life — has become the creed that dare not speak its name, except late at night on MSNBC.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/the-cause-by-eric-alterman-and-kevin-mattson.html

He argued that liberals who routinely denounce extreme conservatives as fascists should take a look in their own backyard, and he wasn’t fooling around: “It is my argument that American liberalism is a totalitarian political religion.” Goldberg has read around a bit, and he was able to lace his thesis with embarrassing quotations from progressives past who expressed admiration for Italian Fascism, eugenics and other assorted statist atrocities. But his essential point was a simple one: fascists believe in state control of almost every­thing, and so do liberals.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/the-tyranny-of-cliches-by-jonah-goldberg.html

The horseshoe crabs, velvet worms and other venerable creatures he encounters are Earth’s true conservatives. “We’ve devised a system that works very well for our niche,” they would tell us. “No big changes necessary. Maybe just a tweak at the molecular level.” As Fortey says, “to look at a living horseshoe crab is to see a portrait of a distant ancestor repainted by time, but with many of its features still unchanged.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/horseshoe-crabs-and-velvet-worms-by-richard-fortey.html

It is obvious that Héctor Abad had no choice but to tell it — as a personal catharsis, surely, but also as a reckoning with his country, Colombia, and its near-perpetual state of violent strife. “I draw out these memories from within,” Abad tells us, “as one gives birth, as one removes a tumor.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/oblivion-a-memoir-by-hector-abad.html

The book takes place in the 1950s, which is around the time that Morrison (or Chloe Wofford, as she was still known) started thinking seriously about race relations in this country, according to a recent profile in the British newspaper The Guardian. In the late ’40s, as a freshman at Howard University in segregated Washington, D.C., Morrison saw news footage of white mothers in the South trying to overturn a school bus with black children inside. “I didn’t know if I could turn over a bus full of little white kids,” Morrison said. “I didn’t know if I could feel that . . . fury. And I tried very hard to. This is what I did: I said suppose . . . horses began to speak. And began to demand their rights. Now, I’ve ridden horses. They’re very good workers. They’re very good racehorses. Suppose they just . . . want more. Suppose they want to go to school! Suppose they want to sit next to me in the theater. I began to feel this sense of — ‘I like you, but . . . ’; ‘You’re good, but. . . . ’ Suppose they want to sleep with my children?!” Morrison laughed. “I had to go outside the species! But it worked, I could feel it. You know; don’t sit next to me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2012-05-21,Graphic Books Best Sellers: The Relationship of an Artist and an Original Beatle,"New to our graphic books hardcover best-seller list this week, at No. 7, is “Baby’s In Black,” which chronicles the relationship between the artist Astrid Kirchherr and Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bass player of The Beatles, who met in Hamburg during the earliest days of the band. The graphic novel, by the cartoonist Arne Bellstorf, is already a success in Germany, and does a wonderful job of capturing the small moments of everyday life. It feels authentic, no doubt thanks to the extensive input from Ms. Kirchherr. The illustrations, in black and white with sketchy gray tones, are, for the most part, warm and inviting. “Baby’s In Black” has a couple of drawbacks: all of Mr. Bellstorf’s faces have small swirls of gray on their cheeks. It’s easy enough to get used to, I suppose, but this graphic tic often makes the characters look dirty (is that a smudge?) or surprised (are they blushing?). For those who know their Beatles history, the ending will be a foregone conclusion, but the story was new to me and I found the handling of Mr. Sutcliffe’s death quite abrupt.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/graphic-books-best-sellers-the-relationship-of-an-artist-and-an-original-beatle/

The Supreme Court’s ruling that racially segregated schools were “inherently unequal” shook up the nation like no other decision of the 20th century. Civil rights advocates, who for years had been patiently laying the constitutional groundwork, cheered to the rafters, while segregationists mourned “Black Monday” and vowed “massive resistance.” But as the anniversary was observed this past week on May 17, it was hard not to notice that desegregation is effectively dead.

2012-05-21,Only Connect | Doug Aitken’s ‘Song1’,"The artist Doug Aitken likes to bring people together. His 2006 book “Broken Screen” featured conversations with 26 artists, from Robert Altman to Rem Koolhaas. One of his favorite mediums is “the happening,” a sort of catchall for dynamic events he produces that can entail anything from live musical performances to panel discussions to line dancing. And yet in his video work, he tends toward lonely, restless souls like the insomniac city dwellers in the 2007 video “Sleepwalkers” (see trailer, here) or the any of the solitary animals that found themselves cooped up and climbing the walls in a remote desert motel in his 2008 piece “Migration (empire).” “Song1,” which finished a two-month run at the Hirshhorn Museum yesterday, is no exception. Only in this piece, the individual characters find a connection in the notes and lyrics of the doo-wop ballad “I Only Have Eyes for You,” which Aitken calls the perfect pop song. “The gritty romanticism of the piece suggests searching or loneliness, but the song binds the characters together,” says Kerry Brougher, the Hirshhorn’s deputy director and chief curator. The video, which was projected onto the windowless exterior of the Gordon Bunshaft-designed building from dusk until midnight, had a similar effect on the local community. Most nights the National Mall is a pretty desolate place after the sun goes down. “It turned the museum inside out,” Brougher says of “Song1,” noting that some nights there would be as many as 3,000 people camped out on the museum grounds, all watching together in quiet isolation.

2012-05-23,Russia Demands Inquiry in Death of Child in U.S.," The United States government tried to head off a diplomatic row with Russia on Tuesday after Russian officials demanded an investigation into the death of a Russian child in an adoptive American family. American news media reported last week that Anton Fomin, a nine-year old Russian child adopted into a Nebraska family, died in a house fire while his parents were gone. On Monday, Russia’s children’s rights ombudsman, Pavel Astakhov, demanded an investigation, saying that American investigators had established that the child had been locked in the basement. “Either the boy was punished or he was neglected and got into the basement accidentally,” Mr. Astakhov said, according to RIA Novosti news service. “Why the boy was locked in the basement and why he could not get out, we will ask the U.S. attorneys about this.” The United States Embassy in Moscow expressed its condolences to the child’s family on Tuesday, and corrected what it called “unsubstantiated reports” that he was brought to the United States through an adoption program. “Anton immigrated to the United States with his biological parents, not through intercountry adoption,” the statement said. Russian authorities have repeatedly criticized lax checks on adoptive American parents after a spate of high profile deaths involving negligent and abusive families. Last December, Mr. Astakhov threatened to demand a moratorium on adoptions by Americans after a Pennsylvania court released a pair of adoptive parents with time served after they were convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a child.

2012-05-23,Stone Links: Badiou on Love and Politics,"Alain Badiou is France’s most famous living philosopher, an unrepentant communist and hardened veteran of the student protests of 1968. Yet a recent profile in the Guardian notes that this most anti-bourgeois of thinkers has released a book called “In Praise of Love,” which is apparently as much a personal memoir as it is a philosophical meditation on what many see as a particularly bourgeois virtue. According to Badiou, “solving the existential problems of love is life’s great joy,” and our society has confused that joy, directed towards “the very being of the other” with a mere sexual pleasure that fetishizes the body. Unfortunately for us, “when you liberate sexuality,” the problems of love remain unsolved. It would seem that the greatest love of Badiou’s life, however, has been politics, which still makes his “eyes gleam.” As the piece concludes: “Perhaps politics and love are not, if you’re a French Maoist, so very different.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/stone-links-badiou-on-love-and-politics/

George Ryan and a C.I.A. leak case against I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, said he would consider other government work, but ruled out running for office. “I’m not wired to campaign for anything or run for elected office,” he said. “Period.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/us/illinois-departing-prosecutor-has-a-regret.html

That spy, we now know, was Henry A. Crumpton — or Hank, as he’s been called since his childhood in rural Georgia — and his memoir, “The Art of Intelligence,” is new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 3. After 9/11, Crumpton was one of the C.I.A. operatives responsible for defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. In 2010 he told the “60 Minutes” correspondent Lara Logan how he went about it: “In a very crude way, it would be a carrot and a stick. The carrot would be, ‘If you come cooperate with us, we will reward you and your people.’ The stick was, ‘If you do not cooperate, the chances of your survival are greatly diminished.’ And we would prove this by attacking Taliban leaders who had rejected our overtures.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

We are too often occupied with distractions, rather than trying to answer a simple question: What works? What economic policies have succeeded before and are most likely to lead to the best life for the largest number of people?

This ever greater disparity, he thought, would ultimately undermine capitalism. Marx turned out to be wrong. Income inequality in Britain (and, from what we can tell, elsewhere in Europe too) began to narrow after the 1860s, and inequality in wealth peaked by the time of World War I. In America, inequality in both incomes and wealth began to lessen after the 1920s.

Though she was a smart and seasoned actress who had worked in film as well as onstage, she was known mainly to Stockholm theatergoers. Her name barely surfaced in the lively public debate in Sweden over who should play Lisbeth, one of the most sought after film roles for a Swedish actress in recent memory. Moreover, the film’s director, Niels Arden Oplev, feared that Rapace was too attractive to portray the androgynous Lisbeth. After working through a scene with her, though, he changed his mind. “When she’s Lisbeth and you put a camera on her, and she’s just sitting there looking at you, you think, Oh, my God, what is she going to do?” he says. “There’s an unpredictable, dark, dangerous energy that flows from her.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/noomi-rapace-arrives-in-hollywood-by-way-of-outer-space.html

2012-05-25,How Roland Barthes Gave Us the TV Recap,"Among the brand-name French theorists of the mid-20th century, Roland Barthes was the fun one. (Foucault was the tough one, Derrida was the dreamy one, Lacan was the mysterious one — I like to imagine them sometimes as a black-turtlenecked, clove-smoking boy band called Hors de Texte, with the hit album “Discipline ’n’ Punish.”) Instead of constructing multivolume monuments of systematic thought, Barthes wrote short books built out of fragments. He was less interested in traditional coherence than in what he called jouissance: joy, surprise, adventure, pleasure — tantric orgasms of critical insight rolling from fragment to fragment. He proclaimed the death of the author and advocated a style of reading he referred to as “writerly,” in which readers work as active creators of a text. His critical metabolism ran unusually high: he would flit from subject to subject, defining new fields of interest (semiology, narratology) only to abandon them and leave others to do the busywork. He treated canonical French works with such unorthodox flair it drove conservative professors crazy. (Barthes first rose to prominence, or notoriety, thanks to the furor surrounding his early book about Racine.) In his inaugural lecture at the Collège de France — a sort of mission statement for the most prestigious academic post in the country — Barthes announced that he aspired above all to “forget” and to “unlearn” and proposed, as a kind of motto, “no power, a little knowledge, a little wisdom and as much flavor as possible.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/how-roland-barthes-gave-us-the-tv-recap.html

The material of the handle remained unspecified, but the netting was crucial: it reduced wind drag, giving the swatter a “whiplike swing.” By 1901, Montgomery’s invention was advertised in Ladies’ Home Journal as a tool that “kills without crushing” and “soils nothing,” unlike, say, a rolled-up newspaper might.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/who-made-that-fly-swatter.html

Contemporary readers raised on blood sport in Panem may find the series tame, but the novels are charming and well told.

Yet until “Wolf Hall,” her historical novel about the reign of Henry VIII, won the Man Booker Prize in 2009, she was much less well known in Britain, and in this country she barely registered at all. There may be nonliterary reasons for this: Mantel, who has been in ill health for much of her life, doesn’t live in London, doesn’t have a posh accent, doesn’t travel much, doesn’t regularly turn up on the chat shows. But another reason she isn’t better known may be that she’s a hard novelist to know, or at least to categorize: she’s always reinventing herself. Her new book, “Bring Up the Bodies,” a sequel to “Wolf Hall,” is one of very few Mantel novels that bear much resemblance to any of the others.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/books/review/bring-up-the-bodies-by-hilary-mantel.html

For 13 years, Catherine has been Tindall’s mistress. He was older, married, a father, but the pair of them lived a blissful, secret life together. Now Tindall is gone — felled by a heart attack on the Underground — and gone with him, in Catherine’s mind, is all good, all possibility of happiness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/books/review/the-chemistry-of-tears-by-peter-carey.html
2012-05-25,State of Paradox,"“India” and “change” were once virtual antonyms: old India hands returned again and again in large part because the subcontinent was so dependably different from the West. But since 1991, when a financial crisis forced India’s government to devalue the rupee, lower import barriers and relax controls on private investment, things have nearly reversed themselves.

2012-05-25,The Counterculture’s Mark Twain,"Richard Brautigan burned through his short career like a rock star. Born in Tacoma, Wash., in 1935, he handed out poems on the streets of pre-hippie San Francisco, then caught an updraft in the zeitgeist with his 1967 novel, “Trout Fishing in America,” that even he couldn’t have seen coming. Playfully elliptical, without plot or conventional characters, the book sold two million copies and transformed Brautigan into a libidinous Mark Twain for the new counterculture: a distinctly American voice that was so of its moment that it had nowhere to go but into a time capsule. By the time he ended his life in 1984, buffeted by drink and debt, he could not get an acceptable offer to publish his last novel. Thomas McGuane, a friend and sometime rival, summed up Brautigan’s arc succinctly: “When the 1960s ended, he was the baby thrown out with the bath water.” In life and death he was a moral fable for an era that invites easy moralizing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/books/review/jubilee-hitchhiker-a-biography-of-richard-brautigan.html

The decision by Ms. Rousseff, which removes 12 articles from the bill, alters legislation sought by powerful agricultural groups. The bill had provoked outrage among environmentalists, some business leaders and cultural icons, especially over a provision that effectively granted amnesty to landowners who illegally deforested some areas. Responding to these concerns, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the president’s line-item vetoes ruled out amnesty. Still, Ms. Rousseff’s action fell short of the expectations of environmental groups, which had wanted her to veto the entire bill. Details about the changes to the bill were sparse on Friday, with Brazil’s powerful Agriculture and Livestock Confederation withholding comment. The official text of Ms. Rousseff’s alterations, which include dozens of suggested changes to the bill in addition to the vetoed portions, is expected to be published on Monday.

Born in Connecticut, Glasser lives in Paris with his wife, who’s French. But his latest work sprouted out of the year they just spent in Texas — a “self-imposed exile,” Glasser called it, intended to help his young children learn English. That sojourn produced a trippy silent film, streaming above, which was made around Barton Springs, a popular place to swim in Austin. In the exhibition, this film is projected onto a concave piece of glass that was once a television screen. “My tourist-grade camera does some interesting things when the sun reflects off the water so intensely,” Glasser said. “The images in this film have not been manipulated other than what I got just using my camera.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/now-showing-lone-star/

Three linked stories feature three birds trying to outdo the others in one way or another. Who is tallest? Who flies highest? Is it better to be up or down? With clever humor, the simple text conveys lessons about adjectives, opposites and early math concepts. Long’s brightly colored exotic birds look like a cross between Mo Willems’s pigeon and Nickelodeon cartoons — animated, expressive and entertaining. A judicious sprinkling of oversize flaps provides an interactive element that expands — literally — on the proceedings.ANIMAL 123By Britta Teckentrup.18 pp. Handprint Books/Chronicle Books. $12.99.(Picture book; ages 2 to 4)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/books/the-best-interactive-and-pop-up-books-of-the-season.html

2012-05-30,New Digs | The Hole Shop at the Hole Gallery,"Back in 1999, before retail moved in and skinny jeans became the neighborhood’s de facto uniform, the hippest place on the Lower East Side was Alife, a sneaker shop-cum-gallery on Orchard Street that served as both clubhouse and launch pad for a generation of downtown artists, including Steve Powers, a k a ESPO; Ryan McGinley; and Dash Snow. Two of Alife’s founders, Rob Cristofaro and Arnaud Delecolle, have since gone on to found a design agency called New York Art Department, under the guise of which they’ve taken on a new retail project: the Hole Shop at the Hole Gallery. “The idea is to bring some of what we were doing at Alife, before the scene was appropriated and commercialized, and apply it to what’s going on today,” Delecolle explains. The merchandise includes books, T-shirts, Polaroid cameras from the Impossible Project, Krink markers and sustainable furniture made by the Brooklyn design firm Uhuru. Since taking over the Bowery space a couple of months ago, NYAD has also hosted book-release parties — the French graffiti artist FAFI dropped by last week to sign copies of her first comic book — as well as film screenings and a 24-hour-a-day curated video screen that’s currently under the auspices of Luck You, a collective of teenage artists who work out of a loft in Chinatown. Continuing Delecolle and Cristofaro’s tradition of introducing new artists to wider audiences, on June 1 they’re curating their first show at the Hole Gallery. It will feature the work of a graffiti artist known only as Jim Joe, whose combination of anonymity, ubiquity (Jim Joe’s cryptic tags are all over the East Village and the Lower East Side) and epigrammatic use of social media has spurred a cult following. “Jim Joe is one of those artists who have one foot in the graffiti world and one foot in something weirder and more conceptual,” says Kathy Grayson, the Hole’s founder. “I’m really excited to see what he comes up with for his first gallery exhibition. I’m sure that it will capture the odd humor and serendipitous, random mischievousness of what he does in public places, and I get the sense that he is sophisticated enough to make it work in a new way in a gallery space. I would definitely say that this is a very hotly anticipated show as no one knows who he is and everyone wants to see what he does next.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/new-digs-the-hole-shop-at-the-hole-gallery/

2012-05-30,Table Talk | Rosemary’s in Manhattan,"When the restaurateur Carlos Suarez (owner of Bobo) was away at English boarding school, he missed the rustic meals cooked by his mother, Rosemary. “My father had his own business, so he worked a lot,” Suarez said. “Family dinner was our opportunity to sit together and enjoy her cooking: salads with tomatoes or avocados from the garden, shepherd’s pie and schnitzel (she’s English with an Austrian background).” Now living in a house with an olive grove in Lucca, Italy, Rosemary’s specialties have since changed, and it comes as no surprise that her son has named his new Italian restaurant in her honor. In the space that once housed Cushman’s, then Sutter’s Bakery, Suarez has Wade Moises, former chef de cuisine of Eataly, overseeing a kitchen that makes fresh pasta and focacce, as well as seasonal dishes prepared with ingredients grown on the restaurant’s organic rooftop garden. (The day’s harvest gets dropped down to the dining room in a basket on a block and tackle.) “It’s an opportunity to bring the source of the food literally a flight of stairs away from your dining table,” said Suarez, who plans to give students from the local Public School 41 tours and lessons on “how to turn those vegetables into lunch. We’re hoping to offer generosity, camaraderie and engagement — a sense of community,” he said. There’s another unusual aspect to the joint. Beyond the reclaimed wooden table tops, Suarez has gone green with a Dekar Design interior: “Instead of filling space with taxidermy and black and white photos, we used nature as our décor.” Inside are towers of artichokes and lemons, even “little Dr. Seuss” blueberry trees. Outside, the roof will also soon feature a beehive and chicken coop.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/table-talk-rosemarys-in-manhattan/

It includes not only a group of simple and thoughtfully designed striped tees in fresh West Coast colors, but also all of the things that support a summer well spent wearing them: sheared cotton towels that read “Seashore” and “Poolside,” espadrilles, Turkish “foutas” (multi-use textiles) and straw fedoras, to start. This month the designer adds yet another must-have to the mix — a limited edition long-sleeve style featuring a wiggly stripe hand-drawn by the artist Elliott Puckette, a friend of Leach’s. “I wanted the shirt to appear to be a canvas,” Leach says. “I didn’t want trims or excessive stitching to interfere with the grace of the lines.” Available in four colors — soft black, pink, sky blue and pool blue — the Pima cotton tees echo Puckette’s preferred palette. For her, the design process began as ink on paper. “Ordinarily I etch the lines in my paintings, which is fairly laborious and slow,” she says. “I found the process of drawing these lines instead very meditative and fluid.” Here, the artist Leanne Shapton surrounds herself with all four.
