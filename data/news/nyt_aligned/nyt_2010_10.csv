2010-10-01,The BP-Spill Baby-Turtle Brigade," Loggerhead nesting season started this year, as usual, in May. Across the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, female sea turtles began plodding out of the water and up the beach, each burying a clutch of a hundred or more leathery eggs beneath the sand. The eggs incubate for about 60 days. Then a throng of tiny black loggerhead hatchlings, each only about two inches long, frantically boils out of the ground, all paddling clumsily with their outsize, winglike flippers. They scuttle down the beach en masse, capitalizing on a one-time frenzy of energy to rush into the water and push past the breakers into offshore currents. Once they make it there — if they make it there — they typically find their way onto mats of seaweed called sargassum. The hatchlings will drift passively around the ocean on this sargassum for the first several years of their lives, like children inner-tubing in a swimming pool. It’s a life raft from which, conveniently, they can also pluck snacks. Many turtles wind up gliding around the Florida peninsula and floating as far out as the Azores during a developmental stage biologists call “the lost years.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/magazine/03turtles-t.html

2010-10-01,Timeless | Page Turner,"In 1966, the furniture company Stendig commissioned Massimo Vignelli to design a promotional calendar. The result, a 3-foot-by-4-foot black-and-white grid of numbers and letters, was snapped up by the Museum of Modern Art for its permanent collection before a single calendar was printed. And it has been in print ever since, becoming at one point a fixture in the office of architects like Richard Meier, whose books and Web site are also designed by the legendary Vignelli. ‘‘I wouldn’t do anything without Massimo,’’ Meier insisted. ‘‘We both resolve ideas with a grid.’’ For Vignelli — who, with his wife and partner in Vignelli Associates, Lella, is also known for designs like New York City’s 1972 subway map and stacked plastic dinnerware for Heller, and who co-designed the just-opened Vignelli Center for Design Studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology — the calendar is an exercise in white space (or black; random pages of the calendars are reverse-printed). ‘‘For us, the space outside the type is more important than the type itself,’’ he said. Vignelli also designed a smaller version of the calendar, which he wishes were still in production. ‘‘Some people don’t have room for the large one,’’ he explained. But no matter: even if Vignelli doesn’t receive royalties for it, he’s happy that the big calendar is still in print. ‘‘It’s nice to see how fresh it still looks.’’ Go to unicahome.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/timeless-page-turner/

In New York, three state-senate candidates who ran on pro-charter-school platforms each failed to garner more than 30 percent of the vote. In Washington, voters overwhelmingly rejected Mayor Adrian Fenty in favor of the City Council chairman, Vincent Gray, as the Democratic candidate in this year’s mayoral election.

Noting that some ingredients must be chopped or otherwise prepared is not necessarily a command to do so, but rather an aid in accurate measurement. Once the cook knows that he has everything he needs to make the dish, he can decide what should (or may) be prepared in advance, and what steps can be taken while others are in progress. Cooking is an art as much as a science, so recipes should be a starting point for exploration and enjoyment; they are not meant to annoy or intimidate, but rather to encourage and inspire.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/magazine/03Letters-t-COOKINGWITHD_LETTERS.html

The machine is simply a conduit for human interaction. In fact, the 2010 online teacher of the year, Teresa Dove of the Florida Virtual School, credits the online environment with allowing more interaction and feedback to her students, noting that, “You might be separated geographically, but spending that one-on-one time with the kids is the biggest asset for an online instructor.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/magazine/03Letters-t-QUESTIONSFOR_LETTERS.html

2010-10-01,Now Online | T’s Fall Design Issue,"The fall issue of T Design looks at different visions of domestic bliss. We look back at Design Research, the revered godfather of modern design stores. Pilar Viladas visits an airy, open house in Italy by the superstar designer Patricia Urquiola for Patrizia Moroso, the creative director of the cutting-edge furniture company Moroso, while Nicolai Ouroussoff considers a very different dwelling: a seven-sided house in Southern California, by the Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan for the artists Lari Pittman and Roy Dowell, which spirals around an intimate courtyard, looking inward rather than out. Our Profile in Style focuses on Barnaba Fornasetti, the scion of a legendary design family who has made his own kind of magic. Alexandra Lange spends time with Renate Müller, the German designer of meticulously crafted, whimsical therapeutic toys, and Judith Nasatir peers into the exquisite world of Federico de Vera, the gimlet-eyed proprietor of one of New York’s most magical design shops. On an entirely different note, Jaime Gross takes a peek at a San Francisco medical marijuana dispensary that is as elegantly designed as any fashion store—bringing an often taboo subject out of the shadows. And the endpage features a calendar, by the graphic-design legend Massimo Vignelli, that is still timely after 44 years.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/now-online-ts-fall-design-issue-3/

Ouadahi grew up in Algeria and studied architecture before enrolling at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, in the German city that is now his home. His subject matter is the built environment of urban alienation: underground passageways, chain-link fencing, the sterile Modernist high-rise buildings that are home to so many immigrants in European cities. Ouadahi’s almost pretty color palette makes his screen-like, gridded high-rise facades seem seductive, until you realize that beyond them is a barren, depopulated landscape. His precisely rendered, claustrophobic tiled passages would make Kafka break out in a sweat, and his delicate depictions of chain link cover the canvas to its edges, suggesting a net that leaves no way out. The exhibition continues through Nov. 13. 531 West 36th Street; (212) 563-5454.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/now-showing-driss-ouadahi/

2010-10-04,Weekly Pick ‘Em: Sorting Things Out,"This Saturday was circled on the schedule by many college football fans at the beginning of the season, with Alabama against Florida and Oklahoma versus Texas looming as two of the year’s marquee games. But a funny thing happened in September. A few things, actually. Florida, while undefeated, has looked a little sluggish in the first few weeks of the post-Tim Tebow era; Texas appeared lethargic in losing to a seemingly unimposing U.C.L.A. team in Austin last week; and Stanford has developed into a top-10 team behind an explosive offense led by quarterback Andrew Luck. All that means that Stanford at Oregon has become perhaps the most intriguing game of the weekend, with the Cardinal traveling to the always raucous atmosphere of Autzen Stadium to try to prove that they belong in the top tier of the Pac-10. As for Florida, every team in college football wishes they could struggle as well as the Gators. Still, Alabama has been No. 1 since the season’s start and the return of Mark Ingram two weeks ago has made a terrific running game that much more formidable. These teams have been the class of the Southeastern Conference for several years and there is always a chance for an epic game when they play each other.

The studios have wrestled with their dual ownership of the project over the last year but a financial deal should be in place over the next several days, according to several people who have been involved in the bargaining. Still pending: a labor dispute that has led Mr. Jackson and the studios to say publicly that they would consider moving the films out of New Zealand.

CBS’s crime shows delivered the night’s largest audiences, with “CSI” earning 13.3 million viewers at 9 p.m., and “The Mentalist” drawing 14.6 million at 10.

My Dad Says” outperformed all other programming in the 8 o’clock hour, including Fox’s “Bones” (9.6 million), ABC’s disappointing “My Generation” (3.9 million) and NBC’s comedies “Community” (4.5 million) and “30 Rock” (5.7 million). ABC ranked second for the night, earning solid results for its medical dramas “Grey’s Anatomy” (12.2 million) and “Private Practice” (8 million).

In the dimly remembered recesses of, oh, 2009, people involved with the two-movie version of the J. R. R. Tolkien book, then to be directed by Guillermo del Toro, insisted that 2-D screen technology was just right for a pair of movies that were viewed as being a little more intimate than their sweeping precursors in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.

It involves Mr. and Mrs. Senior Government Official (Bradford Cover and Rachel Botchan) watching a performance of Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake,” with a low-level counterpart and his wife (Chris Mixon and Lee Stark) seated directly behind them. The offending outburst causes a ticklish pantomime of flying nasal debris, mortification, apology, insult, umbrage and political death, before it crescendos to cardiac arrest.

It has an eye-popping white-on-white décor — including an illuminated wall made of 17,500 water bottles — and an over-the-top genre-busting menu from Masaharu Morimoto, one of the stars of “Iron Chef America,” on the Food Network. But the restaurant, on 10th Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, also manages a casual ease, which on Tuesday drew in a regular customer indulging in the $120 omakase menu at the sushi bar; co-workers sharing cocktails and snacks in the subterranean lounge; and a neighbor entertaining his parents visiting from Fulda, a small town in Germany.

2010-10-04,Ukraine: Court Gives President Some of Parliament’s Power," President Viktor F. Yanukovich’s control over the government grew on Friday when the constitutional court handed him some of Parliament’s powers. The court overturned changes in the government’s structure, adopted in 2004, that had split authority between the president and Parliament. Mr. Yanukovich, above, who took office this year, praised the decision, saying that he hoped to go even further by holding a referendum on a new Constitution. But his opponents said he had rigged the court and was trying to create an authoritarian system. Mr. Yanukovich’s allies control Parliament, and he has a loyal prime minister. But if opposition parties make gains in new elections, it will be harder for them to block his agenda. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/world/europe/02briefs-UKRAINE.html

In 2009, faced with a $40 billion shortfall in the budget through mid-2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger put in place three days a month of mandatory, unpaid furlough for some 200,000 state workers. Employee unions quickly filed multiple lawsuits contending that the governor did not have authority to issue involuntary furloughs. On Monday, the state’s highest court unanimously upheld the governor’s legal right to furlough workers through June 30 of this year, saying that the State Legislature had approved such cost-saving measures in last year’s budget legislation. The ruling comes as legislators and the governor say they have reached an agreement on a budget that is three months’ overdue, the longest budget impasse in the state’s history. Until details of the deal are released, which is expected to be Wednesday, it is unclear if this year’s budget will permit state worker furloughs to continue.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/us/05brfs-STATEFURLOUG_BRF.html

But even within that framework, the latest science about antioxidants, free radicals and exercise is telling. As many of us have heard, free radicals are molecules created by the breakdown of oxygen during metabolism. Each of us constantly creates free radicals simply by living and breathing. But these molecules are highly reactive and capricious, sometimes attacking other cells and damaging tissue. Wilding free radicals have been linked with a number of diseases and with aging. Exercise, because it requires increased oxygen consumption, also increases the production of free radicals. So, many experts began urging the fitness-minded to pop large doses of antioxidant vitamin supplements, like vitamins C and E, to counteract the presumed damaging effects of the free radicals. Food alone would not supply sufficient levels of the necessary antioxidants, it was thought. The exercising body needed help from vitamins.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/phys-ed-free-the-free-radicals/

The main ingredients: one whole goat from the McCormack Ranch in Rio Vista, Calif.; several crates of seasonal produce (and a case of olive oil) from Hudson Ranch in Napa; a basket of morels and porcini gathered near Mount Shasta; an assortment of spices from Boulettes Larder in San Francisco; and a couple of cases of wine from Kermit Lynch in Berkeley. The setting: a shady backyard in Napa (but picture suburban subdivision, not vineyard estate), where a big country table stretches out beneath the canopy of a mulberry tree. The cast: three accomplished Bay Area chefs (Mike and Jenny Emanuel — whose kitchen and backyard we’ve commandeered for the weekend — and Melissa Fernandez), one gifted baker (Chad Robertson), one jack of all culinary trades (Anthony Tassinello) and two amateurs (me and my 17-year-old son, Isaac). The guests: all of the above, plus a rotating crew of spouses, children, friends and neighbors. The fire: almond, oak and mulberry logs burning in a cob oven that Mike Emanuel built with the help of some friends in 2006. A cob, or earth, oven is a primitive, domed cooking device that can be made from layers of mud, clay, straw, stucco, even manure; the earthy mixture, the cob, can endure much higher heat, and hold it much longer, than an indoor oven can. Emanuel’s incarnation, which he built “to bring together family and friends for extended feasts,” stands 5 feet tall with a 30-inch hearth and looks like a cartoon character: a visitor from a planet of chubby, eyeless, big-mouthed monsters.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/magazine/10dinner-t.html

2010-10-06,Letters: Kafka’s Last Trial,"Elif Batuman does a magnificent job of guiding us through the labyrinthine world of Kafka’s literary estate (or what remains of it among the papers of his longtime executor and friend Max Brod) and the highly contentious, occasionally absurd battle to win possession over it. As someone who has conducted research both at the National Library of Israel and at the German Literature Archive in Marbach — the two institutions vying to gain possession of Brod’s papers — I can see certain advantages in each. Yet to my mind one key difference, the critical edge that Marbach holds over Jerusalem, is not so much the state-of-the-art research facility that Marbach is, but rather that its holdings include under one roof the manuscripts of the greatest modern writers and poets of the German language, Jew and gentile alike. It would seem, given Kafka’s universal appeal and his ardent international following among readers and scholars, that this is the most prudent choice.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/magazine/10letters-t-KAFKASLASTTR_LETTERS.html

2010-10-07,Hot Lips,"François Nars’s makeup can be described as dramatic, but his limited-edition Bento Box lipstick set takes the concept literally. Inspired by a porcelain pot of lip stain used for kabuki actors that Nars found in Japan 10 years ago, the set of two cups of hand-poured color comes in a handsome wooden box with a wisteria-handled lip brush. “I’ve always been fascinated with the concept of kabuki makeup,” Nars says. “It’s about symbolism and using color to create drama.” The lipstick application is as seductive as its presentation. “You dip the brush into the cup, around the perimeter, to pick up product, and simply paint,” he says. “It’s a beautiful process.” Unless you want to look like a Japanese theater character, however, Nars recommends using a little restraint: “It’s highly pigmented, so I suggest starting out light and building for desired intensity. It seems intimidating, but the texture is creamy and light and will move easily.” The set will be available for $125 beginning November 1 at Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York, or go to narscosmetics.com/bento to pre-order.

The bells in all parts of the city are tolling. On many doors are pictures and photographs of Gen. Lee, draped in crape, with evergreen. The citizens are standing in groups on the principal thoroughfares and talking in subdued tones of the sad event. The feeling that he ought to be buried here, at the State's expense, is universal, and the Legislature, in making this request of his family, reiterated the public desire. The City Council met this afternoon, at the call of the Mayor. Gov. Walker sent the following Message to the General Assembly:",The Learning Network,https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1012.html

2010-10-08,"In Relief, Yankees Bullpen Lines Up Just Right","MINNEAPOLIS – As he so often has in the past, Mariano Rivera recorded the most important out in the Yankees’ Game 1 victory Wednesday night. Getting Denard Span to ground out with two on and two out in the eighth inning improved the Yankees’ win probability by 13 percent, according to baseball-reference.com, to 92 percent over all. Their second most important out came from someone whose brightest career postseason moment also came against the Twins in last year’s American League division series. Derek Jeter started calling Dave Robertson “Houdini” last year after he escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the 11th inning of Game 2. This time, Robertson was asked to get only one out, but what an out it was, striking out Jim Thome and thwarting a two-on, two-out rally in the seventh. Robertson threw three straight curve balls to Thome. The second dropped over the plate for a called second strike. The third bounced in front of the plate and drew a feeble swing. “That was a beautiful sequence,” Alex Rodriguez said. “He came with the fastball then threw him three nasty breaking balls.” Omitting a second left-handed reliever was a calculated risk by Joe Girardi, who, with left-handed starters set to pitch in four of five games, figured that Boone Logan would be sufficient to navigate through Joe Mauer, Thome and Jason Kubel. To start the seventh, Girardi went with Logan, who got two outs but gave way to Robertson after Mauer singled. The Yankees had seven more outs to get, but the bullpen was set up almost perfectly. Kerry Wood matched up well with the bottom of the Twins’ order, which had right-handed hitters in three of four slots, and the Yankees never have to worry about matchups when Rivera came in. Every one is in Rivera’s favor. If a save situation arises again Thursday, Girardi will obviously turn to Rivera again, though he was uncertain whether he would ask him to pitch multiple innings for a second straight night. Rivera’s struggles last month began on Sept. 11, when he surrendered two ninth-inning runs in Texas, the night after working two innings, and Girardi said he was cognizant of a possible link. “I would prefer not to do it tonight, but I said that last night,” Girardi said. ",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/in-relief-yankees-bullpen-lines-up-just-right/

The council said that the law was constitutional, but that it could not be applied in public places of worship because of the freedom of religion. The decision is the last hurdle for the ban, which has been criticized as stigmatizing Muslim women and violating individual freedom. The law, which will take force next year, sets fines for women who cover their faces in public and criminal penalties for those who force women to wear the full veil. The law is expected to be challenged in the European Court of Justice for violating European human rights law. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/world/europe/08briefs-France.html

2010-10-08,What the Dog Saw,"Murder takes a capital “M” when it appears in most novels, bossing the story around in myriad ways. The guiding principle is that murder (even manslaughter) will out, and the dire secret of the crime will squirm noisily around, leaving clues until its circumstances are discovered. We see a murder in a novel, and then we watch and wait until the layers of plot are revealed through a satisfying, often surprising, set of procedures that make us appreciate how clever the detectives (official and unofficial) can be. But while someone is killed right up front in Scott Spencer’s 10th novel, “Man in the Woods,” the murder doesn’t operate as a motor for the action; instead, it glows like something toxic in the daily lives of the characters. It’s as much a question as an act: What if you killed a stranger who had few ties to the world — a person no one might miss?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Carlson-t.html

One of the largest commercial galleries in Europe, it opened last May and has attracted a fashionable clientele.

Jonathan Raban, who attended the first National Tea Party Convention and wrote about it in The New York Review of Books, was struck by how little agreement there was among “members” as they talked about their griev­ances and aspirations.

Brennan granted more than 60 recorded interviews in chambers and gave Wermiel access to tens of thousands of pages of records, including case files, correspondence and the coveted case histories his clerks had prepared each term. Wermiel completed part of the book before Brennan’s death in 1997, then, as he explains, put the project aside. He came under criticism, most notably from Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker, for his unparalleled access to documents closed to other researchers and for “what little he has managed to make of it.” That was in 2004. In 2006, Wermiel brought Stern, of Congressional Quarterly, to the project and, their note continues, it was Stern who reorganized the vast amounts of material and drafted most of the chapters.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Lithwick-t.html

But in truth, Mustian, a writer and lawyer from Tallahassee, Fla., who is himself distantly of Armenian heritage, tells a story that probes a timeless array of life’s general adversities: the tricks of memory that enable us to carry on with our daily existence; the brash decisions and subsequent regrets of the young; the ever present need for forgiveness; the way a single event can be subject to many interpretations. Mustian embodies the intractability of these difficulties in the image of an Armenian girl with mismatched eyes, “the light eye questioning, the dark eye confirming.” She sees the past and the present, the good and the bad, our side and theirs.

The hero of Ferris’s second novel can’t stop walking — for miles and miles, away from his work at a high-powered law firm, away from his loving wife and troubled daughter. No doctor or psychiatrist has been able to diagnose his “ walking thing,” which becomes progressively worse. “What does it mean?” our reviewer, Jay McInerney, asked. “Tim’s affliction might be a metaphor for addiction, for careerism.” But he found fault with Ferris’s descriptions of the hero’s misadventures: “not bad writing, but . . . not good storytelling.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

Woodward depicts the administration as “deeply divided and riven with suspicions” (as Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times put it in a recent review), but that’s a compliment compared with the portrayals of Obama in the rest of this week’s political best sellers, including Dinesh D’Souza’s “Roots of Obama’s Rage” (anti-American zealot), David Limbaugh’s “Crimes Against Liberty” (socialist evil genius) and Bill O’Reilly’s “Pinheads and Patriots” (pinhead).

2010-10-08,Silent Pictures,"Long before graphic novels earned a dedicated section in bookstores — indeed, before the term “graphic novel” was even coined — the American wood engraver and illustrator Lynd Ward (1905-85) created six enduring examples of the form. Ward was one of only a handful of artists in the world who bucked literary convention by eliminating all words but the title from standard narrative works. His novels often contained more than 100 ­pages, with one image per right-hand page. The pictures, influenced by German Expressionism, were dark and melodramatic, as though taken directly from an early film noir storyboard. Ward’s thematically related sequences and cinematic pacing bridged the divide between mass comics and the more rarefied illustrated book. Now this groundbreaking work, originally published between 1929 and 1937, has been collected in “Six Novels in Woodcuts,” the first graphic fiction from the Library of America.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Heller-t.html

It was the movie of its tumultuous moment, jolting in its violence and vitality. Critics were appalled or blissed out, and wrote about it and wrote about it until it became a veritable fetish. In time it became something other than a great film, something beyond a sexually bold, violent cinematic exorcism of the generational divide.

2010-10-11,Sebold Takes Job as a Book Editor,"Alice Sebold, the author of “The Lovely Bones,” has taken a part-time job as editor of Tonga Books, a new imprint of Europa Editions, a small New York-based publishing house. The new imprint is to publish three or four novels a year, with an emphasis on titles that are dark, cutting-edge or otherwise outside the publishing mainstream. “Sympathetic characters rock,” a news release said, “but we dig” the nasty ones as well. “Tonga cannot pony up the big bucks,” the release also said. “All advances will be in the four figures.” Ms. Sebold, who has never been a book editor, said in a telephone interview that she was still a little stunned that she had agreed to the proposal from Sandro Ferri and his wife, Sandra, the founders and owners of Europa. She added that she hoped to attract first novelists as well as veteran writers who are having trouble getting published these days because their books don’t sell “a gazillion copies.” The initial Tonga book, scheduled for the fall of 2011, is “You Deserve Nothing,” a first novel by Alexander Maksik, who is currently studying at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/books/09arts-SEBOLDTAKESJ_BRF.html
2010-10-11,What’s The Spell For Making a Film 3-D?,"Although Warner Brothers announced early this year that the final two “Harry Potter” films would be released in 3-D, the first of them will not. In a statement on Friday Warner Brothers said it had decided to release “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” on Nov. 19 in 2-D for both conventional and Imax theaters. “Despite everyone’s best efforts, we were unable to convert the film in its entirety and meet the highest standards of quality,” Warner said in a statement. This year Warner was criticized by fans, media types and industry executives for releasing “Clash of the Titans” in a 3-D version that did not measure up to the expectations of some. The final installment in the Potter series, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” will be released on July 15, 2011, in both 2-D and 3-D, Warner said.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/movies/09arts-WHATSTHESPEL_BRF.html

2010-10-11,‘Secretariat’ Horses Learn Hollywood’s Ways,"It’s not easy being an innocent young horse in Hollywood. Just ask the five creatures who collectively played the title character in “Secretariat.” To film that drama, which arrived in theaters on Friday, Walt Disney Studios used a group of horses. One was better for close-ups. One was better for racing sequences. You get the idea. But none of them made it into the credits of the film. And while Disney divulged the names of two of the horses to reporters  Trolley Boy, a 6-year-old from Kentucky, and Longshot Max, a 7-year-old from Oklahoma  the studio refused to identify the other three. A case of equine inequality? Disney didn’t put any of the horses in the credits, a studio spokeswoman explained, in the interest of time. It had been decided that the scroll could last only 4 minutes 30 seconds and there wasn’t room for them. It sounds as if some horses needed better agents. As for the three mystery horses, the somewhat fuzzy explanation involves control. While a professional animal trainer, Rusty Hendrickson, has custody of Trolley Boy and Longshot Max, the other three  used primarily as racing doubles  were sold after filming. Disney, thinking only of the animals, perhaps, did not want the new owners to be able to exploit the horses’ potential celebrity for personal gain.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/movies/09arts-SECRETARIATH_BRF.html

But as for youth (performers under 50), it has always struggled to forge a credible connection between a nightclub tradition nearly done in by rock ’n’ roll and television and the idea of a future. This year was different. All it takes to demonstrate that somehow or other the tradition goes on is a couple of exceptional rising talents. And at the convention’s opening-night gala on Thursday, two singers  T. Oliver Reid and Amanda King  leapt out from the pack. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/arts/music/09convention.html

2010-10-11,Weekly Pick ‘Em: The Grind,"Last Saturday brought a wealth of marquee matchups, including Florida-Alabama, Stanford-Oregon and Texas-Oklahoma. At first glance, this weekend doesn’t look as glitzy. But that’s only because teams are now into the grind of conference play, where each week brings a familiar opponent and the chance to be lulled into complacency. Alabama has one of the more absurd conference schedules in recent memory, with South Carolina the first of six SEC opponents that will be coming off a bye week when they face the Tide. That will make the Tide’s road through the league that much more difficult. Florida will try to bounce back from being handled easily by Alabama when it faces Louisiana State in the Swamp. The Tigers, through a combination of good defense and horrendous clock management, are 5-0 but being treated like they are underachievers. A win against the Gators could give them some credibility. Elsewhere in Florida, Florida State and Miami will play the latest installment of a rivalry that was one of the best in college football over the last quarter century. While that rivalry has lost some of its luster, Michigan-Michigan State has gained some glitz thanks to the outsize performance of Denard Robinson this season. Coach Mark Dantonio is expected to return to the Spartans after missing two games after having a mild heart attack. In the Pac-10, Stanford is coming off a loss to Oregon and Southern California is hoping to prove that it still deserves to be considered one of the conference’s top teams. There is plenty to be excited about now that conference play has started in earnest and the history and familiarity between teams always makes prognosticating that much more difficult. As always, if you agree, disagree or simply find the picks laughable, feel free to let us know. ",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/weekly-pick-em-the-grind/

But there is an earthly game known as Muggle Quidditch, adapted for a grassy field, in which players use volleyballs, basketballs and dodge balls instead of quaffles. “We didn’t really get any big bruisers  they were mostly nerds,” said the club’s founder, Sarah Landis, 20, a sophomore from New Jersey. “A lot of them have never played sports before.” Ms. Landis said the players hoped to persuade the university to bestow official team or “competing club” status by doing well next month in the fourth annual Quidditch World Cup, in Manhattan.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/nyregion/10open.html

It is the failure of our political system to unite, even in a crisis, to produce the policy responses America needs to thrive in the 21st century.

Obscene, goofy and eye-catching, the one-fingered hand looks like a cross between a gag-store novelty and a sex toy. To anyone else, it might well be a joke. To Cattelan, it’s something entirely serious: a prototype for his next sculpture, which is to say, his next test of the public’s equanimity. Cattelan passes the hand to me, and we continue strolling, talking about his plans.

2010-10-12,Moonlighting as a Conjurer of Chemicals,"Sir Isaac Newton was a towering genius in the history of science, he knew he was a genius, and he didn’t like wasting his time. Born on Dec. 25, 1642, the great English physicist and mathematician rarely socialized or traveled far from home. He didn’t play sports or a musical instrument, gamble at whist or gambol on a horse. He dismissed poetry as “a kind of ingenious nonsense,” and the one time he attended an opera he fled at the third act. Newton was unmarried, had no known romantic liaisons and may well have died, at the age of 85, with his virginity intact. “I never knew him to take any recreation or pastime,” said his assistant, Humphrey Newton, “thinking all hours lost that were not spent on his studies.” ",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/science/12newton.html

2010-10-12,The Fabric of Her Life | Louise Bourgeois at Hauser & Wirth,"Louise Bourgeois was reportedly a notorious hoarder. The artist, who died this year at the age of 98, accumulated all manner of tablecloths, napkins, clothing and bed linens — a lifetime’s worth of material, really — which she began to cut up and reassemble into “drawings” in the mid-1990s. Her Collyer Brothers tendencies aside, Bourgeois no doubt found precarious comfort in the nest of this critical mass; she grew up surrounded by textiles in her parents’ tapestry restoration workshop, and the act of sewing, she said, was her attempt to keep things together and make them whole. In this context, the more than 70 pieces in “Louise Bourgeois: The Fabric Works,” an exhibition that aptly christens Hauser & Wirth‘s new space on Savile Row in London, are as poignant as they are vibrant. But taken purely at face value, these pieces make one lament the fact that Bourgeois never moonlighted as a textile designer.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/the-fabric-of-her-life-louise-bourgeois-at-hauser-wirth/

All that is without discussing the designer colors: fig, black, red and olive. The technology is said to leave a certain porosity in the material so dough moisture is absorbed, making for a crisper crust. At 425 degrees in the oven, the crust browns nicely without overcooking the topping. The stone even doubles as a plancha on the grill, withstanding up to about 700 degrees. The maker says the pizza can be cut directly on it without damaging the surface. With some hesitation, I tried it. Not a scratch.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13stone.html

2010-10-13,Jeffrey’s Grocery Lets You Sit and Eat,"Restaurants with little market areas continue to proliferate. The latest, Jeffrey’s Grocery, opened by Gabriel Stulman and his partners, is serious and well stocked, with a little restaurant attached. It could almost be a movie set in its nostalgic perfection, were it not for the merchandise on display. Who had pink carrots in the old days? Purple potatoes? Bunches of lovage? Fat, round golden zucchini? The goods are from local farms, notably from Brooklyn Grange in Queens, and Cato Corner Farm in Colchester, Conn., which also supplies cheeses and veal. Free-range eggs come by the half-dozen in mixed colors. The shelves hold a well-edited selection of staples and condiments, including decidedly unlocal but delicious chocolate bars from Montreal. Some prepared foods  from the kitchen that supplies the raw bar, salads and sandwiches for the informal dining area beyond the retail store  are also sold. Who’s Jeffrey? It’s Mr. Stulman’s father. (The name of Mr. Stulman’s restaurant, Joseph Leonard, comes from his grandfathers.)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13jeff.html

2010-10-14,Legal Tug of War Over Calder Sculpture,"A huge motorized sculpture in Chicago by Alexander Calder, which has greeted and loomed over visitors to the tallest building in the country for 36 years, is at the center of a lawsuit that may put its future location in question. The owners of the 110-story Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, want to keep the sculpture, “The Universe,” in the lobby, and are asking a Cook County Circuit Court judge to block the building’s former owner, Sears, Roebuck & Company, from buying it. The two sides disagreed about whether a 1994 option agreement that would allow Sears to purchase the art for half its appraised value was still valid in July, when Sears notified the current owners, 233 S. Wacker LLC, of its intent to buy. (The original agreement includes a clause terminating the option to buy upon the sale or transfer of the legal title to the tower property.) “The Universe” is 33 feet tall, 55 feet wide and weighs about 16,000 pounds; the plaintiffs’ lawyer, George B. Collins, said it would cost around $250,000 to move the sculpture. But “we don’t plan to move it,” Mr. Collins said. “We plan to win the case.” Kim Freely, a spokeswoman for Sears, declined to comment.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/arts/design/14arts-LEGALTUGOFWA_BRF.html

That puts it on track for a release just five days after Paramount Pictures plans to release “The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn,” also directed by Mr. Spielberg. A Paramount spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Asked about the potential collision, Ms. Snider said, “We think there’s room for a couple of holiday films during that season.” “War Horse” had been scheduled for release in August 2011, and the move pushes that movie into the film awards season but will leave Mr. Spielberg in a bit of a bind as he presumably works to promote both films.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/movies/14arts-SPIELBERGFIL_BRF.html

2010-10-14,"As Populations Age, a Chance for Younger Nations"," YOU MAY KNOW that the world’s population is aging — that the number of older people is expanding faster than the number of young — but you probably don’t realize how fast this is happening. Right now, the world is evenly divided between those under 28 and those over 28. By midcentury, the median age will have risen to 40. Demographers also use another measure, in addition to median age, to determine whether populations are aging: “elder share.” If the share, or proportion, of people over 60 (or sometimes 65) is growing, the population is aging. By that yardstick too, the world is quickly becoming older. Pick any age cohort above the median age of 28 and you’ll find its share of the global population rising faster than that of any segment below the median. By 2018, 65-year-olds, for example, will outnumber those under 5 — a historic first. In 2050, developed countries are on track to have half as many people under 15 as they do over 60. In short, the age mix of the world is turning upside down and at unprecedented rates.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17Aging-t.html

2010-10-14,Municipal Bonds,"I moved to Milan in 1949, when my parents left Piacenza to take advantage of the opportunities for work and advancement that Milan offered after the war. In spite of the depth of the attachment that I feel to the city in which I have built my career, I am always aware that Milan does have its shortcomings and that it lies at times in thrall to a prevailing mood of melancholy, which has perhaps altered its character and diminished its sense of optimism, its capacity to think big and retain the confidence to accomplish its ambitions. As the Italian capital of financial activity and the world capital of fashion, design and opera, Milan derives its unique strength, I believe, from its capacity to promote a continuous flow of creative ideas and harness them into successful commercial ventures. I love this city most when its sense of discipline is evident, expressed through its citizens’ work ethic and ability to plan on a large scale. I also love its rational approach — one driven by passion and generosity. (It’s no coincidence that Milan is the center of the nation’s charitable sector.)

Since 2001, the pair, who collaborate under the G | Lab name, have been drawing attention for their delicately ornate furniture and lighting fixtures made from discarded aged wood and laser-cut iron. ‘‘We are known for breathing new life into traditional materials and forms,’’ Pancaldi says in the G | Lab showroom, which occasionally doubles as a workshop for average Giovannis wanting to learn time-held wood-turning and ironwork techniques. ‘‘All of our designs refer back to 18th-century French and Italian furniture traditions, and to patterns and shapes found in nature.’’ And so a slab of industrial iron becomes a filigreed room divider that is as intricate as it is commanding, and a hunk of maple found in an abandoned sawmill has a second life as a Baroque cabinet. Is this work, which often has Oriental accents, a function of the showroom’s location or the result of travels to Asia? ‘‘I’ve never been to Asia,’’ enthuses the usually taciturn Pancaldi. ‘‘Only the Asia of my imagination.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/now-showing-iron-men-2/

2010-10-15,Inside the List," LIBRARY SCIENCE: In “A Short History of Nearly Everything” (2003), which spent a whopping 76 weeks on the hardcover and paperback best-seller lists, Bill Bryson provided witty CliffsNotes on a panoply of natural phenomena, from supernovas to slime molds. With “At Home,” new at No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list, he aims to write a history of domestic life without leaving the house — in his case, an 1851 rectory in a quiet English village. Bryson wanders his rooms musing on subjects like the evolution of fish knives and the modernization of toilets, stopping in the library to marvel briefly at the revolution brought about by cheap books. When Thomas Jefferson’s father died in 1757, Bryson writes, “he left a library of 42 books, and that was regarded as pretty impressive. A library of 400 books — the number that John Harvard left at his death — was considered so colossal that they named Harvard College after him. Over the course of his life, Harvard had acquired books at the rate of about 12 a year. Jefferson, over the course of his life, bought books at the rate of about 12 a month.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/books/review/InsideList-t.html

Generally, I keep away from fiction or movies about the end of the world, even if it’s just about the end of the world “as we know it.” (I avoid stories set in prison for the same reason: guaranteed nightmares, often involving ferrets, a small cage and me.) In this case, however, I needn’t have worried. Despite a surfeit of the genre’s requisite trappings (food rationing, secret police, universal surveillance, dopey government acronyms), “Chalcot Crescent” might be the least depressing — certainly it’s the most cheerful — dystopian fiction I’ve ever come across, thanks to Weldon’s slashing wit and her refusal to suffer fools gladly, no matter how despotic.

2010-10-15,The News From Shanghai,"In the first four decades of the People’s Republic, Shanghai existed in a strange limbo, a kind of ghostly half-life. No longer the jeweled sewer of decadence and corruption it had once been — a city of opium smokers and courtesans, millionaires and beggars, the high elegance of the Bund and the conspiratorial darkness of the foreign concessions — it lingered on under Communism as an industrial center, a vital source of taxable wealth, but symbolically something of an embarrassment, its foreignness a stain that couldn’t be washed away. Then, after Deng Xiao­ping liberalized its economy in 1991, Shanghai roared back to life and regained its place as a financial and cultural hub, a symbol of China’s dizzying emergence on the world stage.

Winner of the 2007 German Book Prize, her novel brings together the haunting folk echoes of Dinesen’s “Winter’s Tales,” the visual immediacy of Isherwood’s “Goodbye to Berlin,” the narrative cohesion of Mann’s “Buddenbrooks.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

During the last decade’s real estate boom, the annual demonstration kept up with the times: designs abounded with baronial features like colonnades, cathedral ceilings and observation towers, and they sometimes topped 6,000 square feet. But then the crash came, wiping out credit lines and shaking the industry’s confidence.

2010-10-15,Ask the Contractor,"I’m considering radiant heat for my bathroom. How does it work, and is it a good idea?DISALVO: You can only add radiant heat if you intend to renovate your bathroom or at least replace the floor. Once you have the floor up, however, radiant-heat systems are easy to install. You have them on a thermostat, and they heat up and heat the floor, which is very comfortable. The downside is that it takes several hours for the floor to warm up, but once it does it eliminates the need for a radiator. WIENER: There are two kinds of systems. The water system uses plastic tubing with warm water. The electrical uses mats of electrical coils. Water is mostly not allowed in apartment buildings because of the potential for leaks. Both systems are good. DARDICK: I haven’t done a master bathroom in the last three years that did not have a heated floor. Everybody loves them. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like them. But if you live in a cold-weather climate, a heated floor may not be the entire solution for heating a whole room.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17KeyContractor-t.html

2010-10-15,Letters: Kafka’s Last Trial,"It simply won’t do for Elif Batuman to epitomize Kafka’s working life as “working in an insurance agency” (Sept. 26). That office was as fruitful a source of Kafka’s work an any literary or Freudian critic can conjure. In his 14 years as a lawyer, he worked first in Prague for Il Assicurazioni Generali (a Jewish-founded insurance company based in Trieste that featured a menorah in its lobby), the insurer for Workers Compensation in Austria-Hungary before World War I. Before and after the war, he toiled in the same field for the Workers Accident Insurance Institute, the government agency administering benefits for work injuries (no occupational diseases then). Kafka’s projection of what Max Weber called the “iron cage of bureaucracy” was literally lifted from the admittedly boring and unsatisfying work at the compensation agency. “The Castle” and “The Trial” are rife with examples, like the official of “The Castle” who assures the land surveyor that the confusion in question can be “proved from the official papers.” The response: “The papers will not be found.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17letters-t-KAFKASLASTTR_LETTERS.html

When Baker’s sources complain that their boss is being unfairly maligned by foes and friends (or “frenemies,” perhaps) alike, they have a point: The most strident criticisms of the Obama presidency have almost all been at least somewhat unfair, whether it’s conservatives calling the president a socialist and a radical (when actually he’s just a very conventional liberal), left-wingers claiming that he’s a sell-out and a crypto-conservative (when actually he’s accomplished more for the left than any president since L.B.J.), or D.C. insiders dismissing his political skills and salesmanship (hey, you try being a political salesman when the unemployment rate is 9.5 percent!). I’m no great admirer of Barack Obama’s policies, but some of the discontent swirling around the White House at the moment is the usual cult-of-the-presidency nonsense, in which the occupant of the Oval Office is held responsible for forces and events beyond his control, and everyone pretends that the world would be perfect if he weren’t so incompetent, so cowardly, or so evil.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/self-pity-in-the-white-house/

Despite a brutal 1-4 performance last weekend, Paul Myerberg still holds a slim, one-game advantage over Pete Thamel. The real new No. 1 is Ohio State, which faces its first true road test tomorrow night at Wisconsin. Camp Randall is always an intimidating atmosphere, but the Buckeyes hope Terrelle Pryor and a tough defense will be enough to overcome the Badgers’ stout running game. Auburn is one of the last two undefeated teams in the Southeastern Conference (Louisiana State is the other), but the Tigers looked shaky in beating Kentucky last week. They face a stiff challenge from Arkansas on Saturday. Nebraska knows what it feels like to fall from the heights of the Big 12, so the Cornhuskers could have some empathy for struggling Texas if they choose to. They probably won’t though. Michigan is trying to bounce back from a loss to Michigan State, but is running right into an Iowa squad that would like to fight it out with Ohio State for Big Ten supremacy. Meanwhile, in the Pac-10, Oregon State is quietly looking to assert itself as one of the conference’s top teams. It beat Arizona last week and will try to knock off a Washington squad that has already defeated Southern California. There is plenty to watch this week and much to predict.

This year Ladbrokes, the British bookmaking firm, had his chances at 8-1, which made him seem a surer bet than the eventual winner, Mario Vargas Llosa, a 25-1 long shot. Why Adonis appeals to the oddsmakers, presumably, is that he’s a poet, and poets have been under-represented among Nobelists lately; that he writes in Arabic, the language of only one Nobel winner, Naguib Mahfouz; and that as is the case with so many recent winners, most Americans have never heard of him.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/books/18adonis.html

As the third installment in the franchise, this picture was helped by premium-priced 3-D tickets. But it also benefited from an enormous promotional effort by MTV, Paramount’s corporate sibling and the home of the “Jackass” television series. “Jackass: The Movie,” made in 2002 for $5 million, opened to about $28 million (after adjusting for inflation). “Jackass Number Two,” made for $12 million 2006, opened to an adjusted $31.4 million. Finishing second this weekend was the sharply more expensive “RED,” with John Malkovich, an adaptation of an obscure graphic novel. Summit Entertainment spent about $60 million to make “RED,” which took in about $22.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. “The Social Network” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) ranked third in its third weekend, selling about $11 million for a new total of $63 million. “Secretariat” (Walt Disney Studios) was fourth with $9.5 million ($27.5 million total).

2010-10-18,Orpheus Announces Commission Winners,"The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which takes the populist view that musical interpretations can be shaped by the ensemble rather than by a conductor, has expanded on that concept in a commissioning program, Project 440. The orchestra’s goal was to commission four composers to help celebrate its 40th anniversary. Intent on getting its audience involved, it joined forces with WQXR, the New York classical radio station, which opened the process to its listeners. Orpheus and WQXR assembled a panel of more than 30 performers, composers and music executives, who nominated 60 composers. Listeners were invited to peruse the composers’ biographies, to listen to music clips on WQXR’s Web site, wqxr.org, and to comment. The selection committee, taking listener comments into account, chose 30 semifinalists whose music was streamed for 24 hours on Q2, WQXR’s Internet station. That marathon yielded 12 finalists, and 4 winners were announced at Orpheus’s first New York concert of the season, on Thursday at Carnegie Hall. They are Alex Mincek, a New York composer; Clint Needham, who recently completed his doctorate at Indiana University; Andrew Norman of California; and Cynthia Lee Wong, who completed studies at Juilliard. At the concert Orpheus also introduced its new executive director, Ayden Adler. Ms. Adler, a former French horn player in the Rochester Philharmonic, joins the ensemble from the Philadelphia Orchestra, where she was director of education and community partnerships.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/arts/music/18arts-ORPHEUSANNOU_BRF.html

2010-10-18,Now Reading | The Finest Rooms,"Thomas Jayne, the New York decorator, has always brought both a scholarly knowledge of design history and a quirky sense of the modern to his work, creating rooms that bridge the old and the new. And even though there is none of Jayne’s own work in his new book, “The Finest Rooms in America” (The Monacelli Press), his sensibility is evident in his choice of what the book’s subtitle calls “fifty influential interiors from the 18th century to the present.” (Full disclosure: I am mentioned in the book’s acknowledgments, along with a number of other magazine editors, but was not involved in the book.) Any conversation with Jayne on the subject of decorating invariably touches on his passion for great interiors of the past, and indeed, nearly half the rooms in this book are historic, although Jayne includes 20th-century interiors — like the living room of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House and that of Charles and Ray Eames’s house — in this category, along with 18th-century spaces like the Tea Room at Monticello or the Large Dining Room at Mount Vernon. But seeing his broad-ranging eye at work is part of the pleasure of reading Jayne’s book. His selection of contemporary rooms won’t please every decorator — particularly given the book’s somewhat loaded title, an homage to the famous 1964 volume “The Finest Rooms by America’s Great Decorators,” which included interiors by now-departed greats like Rose Cumming, Sister Parish and Billy Baldwin — but it is as catholic as his tastes. So you’ll find the more-is-more drawing room of the jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane and Robert Couturier’s classically inspired dining room sharing the book’s pages with an elegantly spare living room by David Kleinberg and an edgy studio by Christopher Coleman. While many of the rooms are fairly grand in scale and furnishings, it is one of the smallest that that makes your heart beat faster: Albert Hadley’s Manhattan intimate sitting room, an object lesson in understated chic, which Jayne rightly saves for last.

The inventor, a short, thick-set man, with grimy hands, led the way through his workshop, and willingly explained the distinctive features of what he and many others look upon as an apparatus which will soon cause gas-light to be a thing of the past. The lamp which Mr. Edison regards as a crowning triumph is a model of simplicity and economy. In the lamp the light is emitted by a horseshoe of carbonized paper about two and a half inches long and the width of a thread. This horseshoe is in a glass globe, from which the air has been as thoroughly exhausted as science is able to do. So good a vacuum is produced that it is estimated that at the utmost no more than a one-millionth part of the air remains. The operation of pumping lasts one hour and a quarter. At the ends of the carbon horseshoe are two platinum clamps, from which platinum wires run outwardly through a small glass tube contained within a larger one leading out of the glass globe. The small tube contains air. Within it the platinum wires are met by two copper wires connecting with the conductors of the electricity. The air is left in the small tube, because otherwise the copper wires would be fused by the electric current. The carbonized paper is capable of being made incandescent by a current of electricity, and while it allows the current to pass over it, its resistance to the heat is strong enough to prevent it from fusing.",The Learning Network,https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1021.html

2010-10-18,Hope Opera | Fabrizio Ferri’s ‘Anima’,"Fabrizio Ferri is at it again. The renowned fashion photographer, architect, clothing designer and musician has composed an opera, “Anima,” which will be performed on Tuesday in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo (Europe’s oldest opera house, dating from 1737). Ferri was initially contacted by Rosanna Purchia, the theater’s newly appointed “sovrintendente,” to create evocative imagery for the coming season’s performances. For the theater’s first ever promotional campaign Ferri shot dance students from the Teatro’s school in the volcanic surroundings of Mt. Vesuvius, above. Ferri, who had also been working for almost a decade writing, orchestrating and recording the score for a musical film, happened to play a selection of songs for Purchia, who convinced him to turn his film-to-be into an opera for the newly revived theater. “Anima,” which means “soul,” tells the story of North African immigrants who left their homelands behind for a better life in Europe. “The music envelops the people like the sea,” Ferri says, “sometimes soothing, like a mother or father, and sometimes angry and dangerous.” An 80-person choir, a 50-person children’s choir and an 80-piece orchestra will be joined by some gifted friends of Ferri: the trumpeter Chris Botti, who also contributed recordings for the original score; Andrea Griminelli, a world-famous flautist; and Gil Goldstein, an orchestrator. (A surprise appearance by Sting, a longtime friend, is also anticipated.) Ferri credits the creation of this extraordinary event to Purchia and to “the power of this theater, in a moment of crisis, to have the guts and strength to create the necessary energy so artists come to Naples to play this music, to raise their eyelids, to look ahead.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/hope-opera-fabrizio-ferris-anima/

2010-10-18,Now Reading | W.W.D. at 100,"The truth is that Women’s Wear Daily, at least in the beginning, was written for men. Not just any men, but “important men in all departments of women’s wear” who are “scattered everywhere over the earth’s surface and lose track of events and happenings.” (Sounds like your typical fashionisto.) These words appeared in the first issue of Women’s Wear (the “Daily” came later), from June 1910, in a mission statement titled “Our Excuse for Being.” The defensive pose actually makes some sense: it’s not easy to prove, as W.W.D. has, that you can write about an essentially frivolous enterprise without indulging in frivolity. This year marks the end of Patrick McCarthy’s reign over the newspaper but also its 100th anniversary. In celebration of that second, happier occasion, the paper has just unveiled “W.W.D.: 100 Years | 100 Designers” (Fairchild, $65), about its own history and the designers who have animated its pages for a century. The best part of the book are the reprints of old issues: sketches of Paul Poiret’s costumes for a Parisian revue; news of the D-Day landings competing for front-page space next to a report on handbag pricing; and a cover story on the 1999 John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash that mourned as much for Carolyn Bessette — the former Calvin Klein saleswoman, style icon and fashion publicist — as for John Jr.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/now-reading-w-w-d-at-100/

Cults are essentially a two-member band  Ms. Follin and Brian Oblivion, who sings and plays guitar  though during this show they swelled to six, making for a sound far bigger than the group needs. What it needs is basic: the singing of Ms. Follin, seductive and sweet; the chipper xylophone countermelodies that run through many of its songs; and strutting bass lines that recall the swing of 50 years ago. There are other parts to the band’s songs, of which there are currently just a few, but in a short period of time Cults have refined their style, gotten it down cold, made it elegant.

The work consists of roughly 100 million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds covering a vast expanse of floor to the depth of about four inches, and visitors were invited to wade right in. The black-and-white seeds crunched delightfully underfoot, and the whole thing resembled an indoor pebble beach, with people strolling about and then plunking down to sit or recline.

In an essay published over the weekend in the newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, Luca M. Possati writes: “Few people know it, and he does everything to hide it. But it’s true: Homer J. Simpson is Catholic.” As proof the essay cites a Jesuit priest’s study of the 2005 “Simpsons” episode “The Father, the Son and the Holy Guest Star,” in which Bart attends a Catholic school and Homer tries out the practice of confession. The study concludes that “The Simpsons” is “among the few TV programs for kids in which Christian faith, religion and questions about God are recurrent themes.” (Never mind that Homer has said he is a follower of “that religion with all the well-meaning rules that don’t work out in real life,” which he explains to mean Christianity.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/the-next-great-schism-faith-of-cartoon-character-is-debated/

Our friends at Luxe have rolled out a wide collection of their snappy directories for iPhone, covering 20 cities in total, among them Los Angeles, Florence, Venice and Beijing. Now the hotels listings come with pictures; there are GPS-enabled maps and automatic updates; and the whole guide can be searched and personalized with itineraries based on your favorites. What remains from the dead-tree versions, of course, are the cheekily concise summations of a smart selection of accommodations, restaurants, shops, clubs and culture — along with sundry raves, grievances and anecdotes. If there’s one thing lacking, it’s that we might like to read more of what the Luxe founder Grant Thatcher and his team have to say about the three bistros we’re trying to decide between (seriously, Thatcher’s hilarious).

As of Thursday morning, according to a person briefed on the matter, Warner’s New Line unit, which is supervising the production for Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was still considering a move to another country, in part because, in the studios’ view, the New Zealand actors, despite having withdrawn their call for an international union boycott, are continuing to insist that the “Hobbit” producers conduct discussions that would run afoul of New Zealand law.

2010-10-21,Getting the Best Out of Vegetables,"A while ago, just on the seam between summer and fall, I had a good dinner at a blessedly calm London restaurant called Gauthier. My first dish, after the initial sequence of snacky things, was a pair of olive-oil crisps with vegetables sandwiched between them. Kind of like a ratatouille, to give you some sense of the intensity of flavor. But this set of vegetables went beyond the usual summery Mediterranean standbys — eggplant, zucchini, peppers — to include things like carrots (which also grow in the summer, of course), all deeply flavorful both because they’d been carefully purchased and impeccably cooked. I’m guessing that each element of the mixture had been prepared separately – how else to account for eggplant and carrots that were both optimal?",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/getting-the-best-out-of-vegetables/

Many cooks have sworn off it, saying it’s too heavy, too oily. And when it comes to the canned stuff, they’re right. But mackerel can be mild and buttery, especially when very fresh. But, more importantly to me, it’s the oiliness of mackerel that imparts its uniquely briny flavor. When cooked just so, mackerel is a fish you can love to serve as well as eat. And it’s also relatively inexpensive.  Check out these links from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and The Guardian about mackerel sustainability. Recipes:",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/mackerel-the-sustainable-fish/

2010-10-22,The Ice Age,"The award-winning fashion designer Richard Chai has partnered with Daniel Arsham and Alex Mustonen of the avant-design firm Snarkitecture to create an elaborately carved “ice” cavern for a new pop-up shop opening Thursday evening. Conceived by Boffo, an art and culture nonprofit group, and the architect/writer Spilios Gianakopoulos to promote visibility for designers and artists, the project — titled Building Fashion — consists of a series of five rotating installations in a space underneath the High Line (504 West 24th Street). The five participating fashion designers (Simon Spurr, Heather Huey, House of Waris, Richard Chai and Siki Im), none of whom has a freestanding store, were each given the opportunity to create a three-dimensional representation of his or her brand. Chai said he wanted to avoid “the straightforward clothes-on-a-rack retail space” in favor of creating “an environment, a feeling, more of an emotional experience.” The “cave,” which is hand carved from high-density Styrofoam, also allows for irregular crevices and crannies to display merchandise. The store will carry  Chai’s men’s and women’s collections and will be open to the public until Oct. 31 (noon to 6 p.m.), so head over there quickly before it “melts.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/the-ice-age/

2010-10-22,Weekly Pick ‘Em: Sorting It All Out,"When Texas lost to U.C.L.A. earlier this season, it looked as if it might be a rough year for the Big 12. But then Oklahoma, Missouri and Oklahoma State kept on winning. Those three are still undefeated, but this is the weekend when the Big 12 promises to shake itself out. Texas knocked Nebraska from the ranks of the unbeaten last week. Will the Cornhuskers be able to bounce back from that loss and do the same to Oklahoma State? Oklahoma travels to Missouri as the No. 1 team in the Bowl Championship Series standings, and the Tigers would love to prove their legitimacy by knocking off the Sooners. Speaking of legitimacy, Texas Christian does not seem as if it will get a legitimate chance at the national title, even if it keeps dominating opponents. The Horned Frogs face Air Force, which had been ranked until a loss last week. In the SEC, Louisiana State and Auburn are undefeated and in the top 10, but both seem to be searching for respect. Many think it is simply luck that has kept Les Miles’s bunch undefeated, while Cam Newton has kept Auburn winning despite a woeful defense. In the Big Ten, Wisconsin is coming off a huge win over Ohio State. Now the Badgers travel to Iowa, where they hope the running back duo of John Clay and James White will continue their productivity. It’s a weekend where many teams will find out where they stand, and so will our prognosticators.

Which sounds bad, but in a boring way. What the investigative reporter Ken Armstrong and the higher-education correspondent Nick Perry have done, first in an award-winning Seattle Times series and now in “Scoreboard, Baby,” is lay out — in hard-boiled style and with the verve only real story­telling can supply — exactly whose lives were mangled in the course of the University of Washington’s historic 2000 season. Their idiosyncratic characters and plots ultimately indict a vast, impersonal system that has produced dozens of such teams.

Within the conventional novel, it takes some tricky maneuvers to return a grown-up child to the family bosom. Traditional holidays and reunions still serve for short visits, although you’re probably sick to death of those predictable flare-ups over the Thanksgiving turkey. But extended stays demand something more dramatic in the way of a plot. While the death of an elderly parent or an ailing sibling works in theory, it shifts the attention away from the prodigal child. And that can be a real problem when the writer’s primary interest is in sending the protagonist back to revisit his or her younger self, not to fuss over funeral arrangements and be upstaged by the dearly departed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/books/review/Stasio-t.html

She asked if we had any more in the back, which we did. She cleaned us out and informed us that these books would be going to Russia, where they would give her Russian students a glimpse of life in America. (Hmm. Had to wonder what impression some of those would make.) Instead of producing the expected credit card, she proposed an unusual barter. “I own a seafood company in Maine,” she explained. “How would you like to get paid in lobster?

Sometimes (often when you are thirstiest) it feels like it will never be ready to drink. (Anyone else getting thirsty?) That’s how this season is going. It’s taking forever to settle. The picture is still hazy. Just when it seemed like we knew what was going on the No. 1 team started losing every week. Now it seems we know even less. Will Oklahoma be the third straight No. 1 to go down? Don’t sleep on Missouri and its nasty defense. Who will remain as the last unbeaten in the SEC after Auburn hosts L.S.U.? Will Cameron Newton’s stock continue to rise? Or will he pull a Taylor Martinez/Denard Robinson when he faces a tough L.S.U. defense? Can Iowa take control of the Big Ten? Can Nebraska bounce back?

Thank you so much; such beautifully written articles. I laughed, cried and stood in awe of the amazing things people are doing with food and creating community. When I finished, I passed the magazine back to my husband and said, “Read everything.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24letters-t-THEFOODISSUE_LETTERS.html
2010-10-22,Recipe Redux,"I admire the magazine’s food-themed issues, which encourage readers to look at food as not just an object of consumption but also as an opportunity to make an impact, for better or worse, through our conscious decisions. The Times regularly reminds us that our food choices not only affect our physical health but also shape our social, environmental, economic and cultural identities. I thus find it paradoxical that the magazine’s Food Issue features a recipe for veal. This issue advocates taking a more holistic perspective on eating and food, and Amanda Hesser’s Recipe Redux extols the impact of The Times’s “classic” recipes over the years. Yet by featuring a 1962 recipe for veal chops beau séjour, The Times fails to heed its own advice. The veal industry, which the ethicist Peter Singer calls “the most morally repugnant” of all “factory farming,” involves tethering calves in pens not wider than two feet so they are unable to stretch their legs from birth until slaughter, and deliberately feeding them a diet lacking in iron, so that their meat reaches a desired tenderness and complexion.

2010-10-22,Pie + Design = Change,"John T. Edge makes clear the disconnect that followed Project M from Maine to Greensboro, Ala., and how the group’s original Pie Lab concept, though charming, shared the drive-by aspect that weakens so many American efforts to do good. I’m sure many of the Project M folks who went to Hale County were drawn by the myth-making of “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” which is a fine work of literature but not a sociology text and one which has been criticized by Hale County people since its release for its drive-by qualities. You get a sense of what discomfits them by a quick glance through the Walker Evans archive at photos of the Burroughs (really Gudger) family that have not become iconic — the ones in which they are smiling and dressed in their nicer clothes. It’s significant that one outsider depicted in Edge’s article who is still making a difference in Greensboro — Pam Dorr — made a life investment in the town by moving there and staying long enough to learn the nuances.

I do not believe that this is the case for two reasons. First, I am quite sure that the considerable number of bank safes held by the Hoffes give enough space to preserve the most important documents.

Yes, it was all for a good cause (some seats sold for $25,000 a pop), a fact that was alluded to if not entirely conveyed by the event’s tagline: “Empowering women on a g-string rather than a shoe-string.” The Belgian-based designer Carine Gilson also offered up her own fantasy twists on linge de corps, which Carine Roitfeld, the editor in chief of French Vogue, has described as “the most refined lingerie in the world.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/photo-diary-lingerie-new-york/

The movie that hits the black in its first three days is almost nonexistent. Most Hollywood releases, with outsize production budgets, enormous marketing costs and a 50 percent split in revenue with movie theater owners, do not turn a profit for studios until the DVD release. But “Paranormal Activity 2” was produced by Paramount Pictures for just $3 million and given a cheaper-than-usual marketing campaign that relied heavily on Web chatter. Paramount was doing cartwheels on Sunday, partly because it also had the second-place movie: “Jackass 3D” took in about $21.6 million for a two-week total of $87.1 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticket statistics. The ensemble action picture “Red” (Summit Entertainment) was third with $15 million for a new total of $43.5 million. Clint Eastwood’s “Hereafter” (Warner Brothers) was fourth in its first wide-release weekend with $12 million.

(The behavior at issue was the ingestion of peyote at a Native American religious ceremony.) The answer the court gave, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority, was that the religious believer must yield to the law of the state so long as that law was not passed with the intention of curtailing or regulating his or anyone else’s religious practice.

2010-10-26,Maker’s Marks,"‘‘Hella Jongerius — Misfit,’’ the title of the Dutch designer’s retrospective that opens Nov. 13 at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, refers not so much to her status in the design world but to the imperfect objects she has long championed. As the exhibition demonstrates, Jongerius has never had trouble finding sympathy for her ideas in the design industry, where companies like Vitra, Ikea and Maharam hired her to introduce beautiful inconsistencies into their sofas, vases and upholstery fabrics. As it turns out, the only people who ever took convincing were the craftspeople themselves. Royal Tichelaar Makkum’s artisans cringed when they were told to fire her 1997 B-Set pottery (above) at too high a temperature, while Nymphenburg’s worried that her 2004 Sketches plates looked half-finished. ‘‘Craft has a tradition of trying to make perfect things,’’ says Louise Schouwenberg, the show’s curator. ‘‘Hella told them to stop trying, because industry can do that better, whereas their appeal is more humane.’’ Jongerius persisted, and these days, evidence of the hand of the maker seems completely natural. The misfits have become the mainstream. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/makers-marks/

2010-10-26,Think Ink,"Cynics, or perhaps graphic designers, might argue that your average perfume is 99 percent packaging. Maybe more. ‘‘A perfume is an image that you cannot see with your eyes,’’ says Mathias Augustyniak, who, as one half of the design firm M/M (Paris), has worked on scent identities for Balenciaga and Narciso Rodriguez. When he and his partner, Michaël Amzalag, approached Ben Gorham of Byredo Parfums with an idea for a fragrance, they were not following their noses. They gave Gorham three inspirations: a block of solid ink they bought in Korea, a photograph of a Japanese friend who is a calligraphy master and an ‘‘oversized absurd formula’’ that Augustyniak drew with ink on a piece of handmade Korean paper. ‘‘We spoke about ink with Ben, who is properly inked since he’s covered with tattoos, which added a layer of resonance,’’ Amzalag says. The result, M/MINK Eau de Parfum, is represented by a sort of smear campaign — artworks made from existing images, by the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, that Amzalag and Augustyniak obscured with slicks of thick black ink. What the fragrance smells like is even more ambiguous. The artist Wolfgang Tillmans, a friend of the designers, described it to them as ‘‘very manly,’’ while a female friend declared that it reminded her of her grandmother, a comment that left Amzalag wondering if the friend had a manly grandmother. ‘‘To me it feels like a roller coaster ride,’’ he says, ‘‘because it keeps changing once it is on your skin.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/think-ink/

2010-10-26,Could Bloomberg Make Palin President?,"As a devout skeptic of both Michael Bloomberg’s presidential ambitions and Sarah Palin’s putative “front-runner” status in the 2012 Republican campaign, I’m naturally completely unconvinced by John Heilemann’s entertainingly bizarre scenario in which Bloomberg runs as an independent in 2012, peels off enough votes and states from Obama to hang the electoral college, and ultimately delivers the White House to Palin. But I’ll confine myself to just one objection. To make his scenario work, Heilemann envisions Bloomberg winning states like New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, behind a combination of moderate Republicans, centrist Democrats and “progressives disappointed with Obama.” In a vacuum, these might be plausible constituencies for Hizzoner — but not in an election where Sarah Palin is the Republican nominee! How many northeastern progressives (or Lincoln Chafee Republicans, for that matter) would contemplate casting a vote for a third-party candidate knowing that it might deliver the White House to the woman they fear and loathe above all others? Not many, I’d say. Nothing would be guaranteed to rally the Obama coalition quite like the specter of a Palin presidency: For months before the election, the drumbeat that “a vote for Bloomberg is a vote for Palin” would be well-nigh deafening, and I’m pretty sure that even a weakened Obama wouldn’t have that much trouble holding serve in that scenario, relegating Bloomberg to exactly the kind of John Anderson-esque performance that would be his most likely fate in any case.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/will-bloomberg-make-palin-president/

2010-10-27,Space Craft,"As a set designer, Gary Card is used to pouring his creativity into a wildly elaborate mise-en-scène, only to see the whole thing dismantled or destroyed once the project is finished. So when the creative director John Skelton and his partner, Dan Mitchell, approached him to design the interiors of LN-CC, a new concept store (think meticulously curated avant-garde fashion, rare books and vintage vinyl) in the scrappy east London neighborhood of Dalston, Card jumped at the chance to create something permanent. He used his surrealist sensibility to transform the space, a former boxing gym, into a hipster fun house. To enter the store, visitors navigate Card’s ‘‘deconstructed forest,’’ only to find themselves in the belly of a beast — a wooden tunnel that resembles a crudely assembled whale skeleton. The rest of the 6,000-square foot-space is divided into individual rooms, like a gallery hung with mannequins (above) and a library lined with asymmetrical shelving. ‘‘Every room needed a distinct atmosphere, tone and temperature,’’ Card says. ‘‘The idea was to move from organic to industrial, from warm to cold. And always keep it open to change.’’ The main attraction is the private club space, with its sound system by the legendary sound guru Mickey Boyle. For Card’s sake, we hope the parties don’t get too out of hand. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/space-craft/

But the emergence of a band of Belgian designers dedicated to a radically deconstructed vision of dress signaled a mucking out its Augean stables. Out with pouf skirts, in with sweaters made of old socks! Abetting this brave new look were the makeup artist Inge Grognard and her photographer husband, Ronald Stoops. Working on magazine shoots and runway shows for Dries Van Noten, Dirk Bikkembergs, Walter Van Beirendonck, Dirk Van Saene and perhaps most famously, Martin Margiela, the couple created some of the most arresting images of the ’90s. The couple’s long-awaited first book, “Inge Grognard Ronald Stoops (Ludion),” out at the end of the month, gathers their favorite images in one coffee-table-ready volume. The Moment recently caught up with Grognard via phone from her home in Antwerp — Stoops and the designer An Vandervorst could be heard chatting in the background — to talk about how fashion has changed since the ’80s, her definition of beauty and the problem with red lipstick.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/face-values-inge-grognards-radical-chic/

One hypothesis is that the increase may be linked to the eruption of Alaska’s Kasatochi volcano in 2008; ash from the volcano may have created a massive algae bloom in Pacific waters where adolescent salmon reside, creating a veritable fish food buffet. If the connection is valid, this year’s record spawn may only be a one-off event, however, scientists said.

About the night’s musical program, Merritt told The Moment, “I suppose I’ll be playing the bubblegum and psychedelic music that I generally play. Maybe with an Octoberish slant — if I show up and there are skeletons hanging over the place.” The exhibit itself, which is on view through Nov. 14, is tied to the release of “Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields,” a documentary, 10 years in the making, which Mike Hale reviewed this week in the New York Times. The exhibit features candid photos of the band, including one of Merritt taking a smoke break on the fire escape at Spin Magazine, where he once moonlighted as a proofreader. Asked what he thinks of music journalists today — he’s a critical darling who in 2006 was the butt of some very bad press — Merritt said: “I think that working for a magazine is the highest possible calling and that all rock journalists are saints that are governing the country.” Yes, Merritt can be sharply sarcastic, and also blunt, as in his appraisal of the documentary itself: “It’s boring — it’s just me and my friends, talking about me.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/fields-study-strange-powers/

The movie has almost no dialogue, and its cheesy soundtrack (some of it borrowed from vintage giallo films) is punctuated with aural shocks and effects, including heavy-breathing gasps.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/movies/29amer.html

The first edition appeared in 1980, when Vreeland was special consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she organized costume shows of Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent, among other legends. She worked on “Allure” with Christopher Hemphill, a process that took three years as Vreeland sought the elusive quality of personality in images of celebrities and models, in their gestures and sometimes violent expressions — a special condition for pictures of Maria Callas — and Mr. Hemphill did his best to oblige her.

The mailers are the handiwork of Hal Malchow, a political consultant who is acting on a theory that first intrigued him four years ago. Before the 2006 Michigan gubernatorial primary, three political scientists isolated a group of voters and mailed them copies of their voting histories, listing the elections in which they participated and those they missed.

Is this, then, the future of e-literature and — perish the thought — of all literature?

Though nothing could replace it in our hearts, we’ll try to keep an open mind about “Rose II,” a 28-foot-tall depiction of a flower that is expected to be fully installed by the end of November.

Matt Tolmach, who had been jointly overseeing Columbia Pictures in a co-presidency with his fellow executive Doug Belgrad, is leaving the executive team for a choice assignment as one of the producers of the next “Spider-Man” film. Mr. Belgrad becomes Columbia’s sole president, while Hannah Minghella was named production president of Columbia. Ms. Minghella was previously the production president of Sony Pictures Animation. Michael Lynton remains the chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which includes Columbia, and Amy Pascal remains the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures. “I couldn’t be happier for or prouder of Matt, Doug and Hannah,” Ms. Pascal said in a statement on Friday.",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/a-shifting-at-the-top-of-columbia-pictures/

2010-10-29,Drop the Weapons,"Since the detonation of nuclear weapons over Japan, American presidents haven’t learned to love the bomb, but rather have worried about it. In 1946, the Truman administration presented the United Nations with the Baruch Plan for international control of nuclear weapons, which Stalin, working on his own bomb, rejected. Four decades later, Ronald Reagan almost signed a deal with Mikhail Gorbachev to eliminate nuclear weapons, but this time missile defense proved an insuperable stumbling block. Now that President Obama and senior statesmen like George Shultz and Henry Kissinger have endorsed the abolition of nuclear weapons, the issue has assumed a fresh ­prominence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Heilbrunn-t.html
2010-10-29,Dream Sequence,"This absorbing novel — the first from the distinguished Spanish author to be translated into English — is full of mild sensations. Mild humor (bacalao soaked for dinner in the toilet tank) gives way to mild horror (a woman bends over another’s baby with “the posture of certain all-consuming insects”), which in turn yields to mild philosophizing (on the “admiration that denizens of the rural world feel for folding things”). At times, the mildness turns to provocation, as when the main character, a simple yet baffling woman named María Antonia Etxarri, watches a troop of soldiers and has “a feeling that one of those soldiers, if not more than one, was going to rape her.” The placidity with which she faces this prospect is galvanic. But de Lope’s languid sentences, artfully translated by John Cullen, continue to unfurl, and you find yourself sinking back into the narrative as if it were quicksand.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Thompson-t.html

Almost a year later, on Sept. 13, 1788, Congress declared that the Constitution had been duly ratified, and prescribed the rules for the first presidential election the following year. Pauline Maier’s delightful and engrossing book shows how America got from the first date to the second — and ultimately to today, since we still live with the same document, however modified.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Brookhiser-t.html
2010-10-29,Sailing Alone,"I grew up loving Joshua Slocum’s “Sailing Alone Around the World.” It was “Walden” without the training wheels. Whereas Thoreau made so much of his precious solitude in a shack only a couple of miles from his home in Concord, Slocum actually put himself at risk. In his 50s, pistol-whipped by fate, he set out in a largely self-built 36-foot sailboat and somehow managed to circumnavigate the earth. He might have been without a crew, but he was hardly alone; he had the magical Spray for a companion: a vessel that could literally steer herself for hundreds of miles at a time while he reclined contentedly in his book-lined cabin eating salt cod and reading “Don Quixote.” For a landlocked teenager who had both nautical and literary ambitions, Slocum was almost too good to be true.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Philbrick-t.html
2010-10-29,Arms and the Man,"The Soviet Union did not often make a product superior to the American alternative. Nobody in his right mind would have chosen to drive a pokey Lada over a speedy Corvette or even a stolid Packard. One of the few exceptions was in the military sphere, where the Soviets devoted a disproportionate share of their resources. In the long run, their greatest engineering triumph may not have been the construction of an atomic bomb in 1949 (based on stolen Western secrets) or the lofting of the first satellite into orbit (1957) or even the first man in space (1961). Far more enduring, if more low tech, was the development of the world’s most ubiquitous firearm: the AK‑47, or as it is often called, after its designer, the Kalashnikov.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Boot-t.html

She’s a find who’s just beginning to be found, at least on our side of the Atlantic (thanks to the novels “Old Filth” and “The Man in the Wooden Hat”), although more than 20 of her books have been published in England and she has won numerous prizes.

The space fuses Red Hook grit with Levantine glam, incorporating a sweeping, 45-seat horseshoe-shaped bar under a warehouse-high ceiling that affords nice views of both the oversize wood oven in the open kitchen and the rotating exhibits on the walls.

This is a time-honored idea in a particular corner of the avant-garde where conventional elements like melody, rhythm, harmonic movement and phrase structure are regarded as less fascinating than timbre, texture, duration, volume and intensity, particularly when these qualities change slowly, if at all.

ABC was third, beginning the night with its annual special “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown” (7 million), followed by “Grey’s Anatomy” (10.7 million) and “Private Practice” (7.8 million).

The idea for the same-language subtitles is a twist on an old technique of teaching students a foreign language by having them watch foreign movies with subtitles in their native tongue. Indian state television began broadcasting the videos nine years ago. Today, the program reaches 200 million viewers across 10 states, and functional literacy in those areas has more than doubled. Other governments are interested. The success complicates the conventional wisdom that TV makes us stupid.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/weekinreview/31grist.html

Because of this disconnect between living fame and later recognition, we have less of a record of these thinkers than we should. Our museums are filled with busts and paintings of long-forgotten wealth and beauty instead of the philosophers who have so influenced contemporary politics and society. My aim in this project has been the modest one of making sure that, for this era at least, there is some record of the philosophers.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/philosophers-through-the-lens/
