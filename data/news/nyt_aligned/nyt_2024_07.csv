In certain corners of New York City, your drink might even feature a plastic dinosaur bobbing above its rim. But at home, a rococo approach is not the only way to surprise and delight. “You have to read the room,” says Erika Flowers, 33, who runs the bar at Compère Lapin in New Orleans, where the drinks are topped with thoughtful accouterments like showers of grated nutmeg and pineapple fronds. In her mind, the purpose of a garnish is to turn the act of cocktail consumption into “a full sensory experience,” engaging the nose and the eyes as well as the taste buds. Here, three chefs and mixologists share their suggestions for embellishments that do just that — and are surprisingly easy to make, too.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/t-magazine/summer-cocktail-garnishes.html

Coleman played nearly 180 roles in his five decades as a performer, but he’s best known for portraying a particular kind of character: a self-centered, closed-minded, chauvinistic jerk.

And though we may see less of Coleman’s distinctive type of man’s man onscreen now, The Times’s Wesley Morris says that we may see traces of him in our politics. Morris joins Melissa Kirsch to discuss what Dabney Coleman showed audiences about powerful men in 20th-century America, and why we’re unlikely to see another actor like him again.",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/podcasts/dabney-coleman-icon.html

After all, it’s a season centered around farmers’ market jewels that barely need polishing and weather that encourages languid gatherings. Lately, that sense of ease arrives in the form of chef-approved staples already dressed for the table. EAT Gohar, a new pantry suite from the home goods brand Gohar World, reads like an age-old shopping list: olive oil and tinned fish, chocolate and tea. “We partnered with the best small food producers we know, from Korea to Lebanon,” says the company’s co-founder, artist Laila Gohar. “It feels like a never-ending dinner party from around the world.” Cantabrian anchovies and Atlantic sardines with preserved lemon, sustainably sourced in collaboration with the tinned-fish brand Fishwife, come in giftable striped boxes. (Bring along a baguette in Gohar’s beribboned carrier.) And for “endless pitchers of iced tea,” Gohar and her sister Nadia offer a peppermint rose hip blend alongside citrus-spiked black tea by way of Seoul. Equally quenching is the elegant canned wine from Oona, a new label that counts chefs among its founding partners. Each release is presented with a meal’s worth of recipes, such as Natasha Pickowicz’s Eton mess, starring strawberries macerated in a barbera rosé from California’s central coast. Later this month, Oona will launch a skin-contact pinot gris for orange-wine heads. “I just went kayaking and we brought a case,” says Alexis DeBoschnek, another Oona founding partner and author of the cookbook “To the Last Bite,” noting the can’s versatility: suitable for a picnic, a rooftop or cracked open for a houseguest fresh off the ferry.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/t-magazine/picnic-outdoor-dining-summer.html

From the South American asado to the Indian tandoor, the fires are varied but often the process that surrounds them is communal. Some use raging heat, searing cuts of meat or a tangle of vegetables on a planchas or iron grate, while others smoke or braise low and slow in underground ovens, tank-style barbecues or kitted-out Green Eggs. Anything can be grilled: stone fruit, pizzas, parcels of banana-leaf-wrapped fish, bouncy cubes of mochi. It’s not air-fryer easy. Yet the effort is well worth it, say the three chefs who share their favored methods and recipes below. “There’s a romance to it — the smell of fish oil burning, mixed with wood smoke,” says the chef Jeffrey Ozawa. “It doesn’t get better than that.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/t-magazine/outdoor-cooking-grill.html

We Would Like a $215 Refund.,"Last September, my husband and I flew to New York City and headed to the Ridge Hotel on the Lower East Side to spend a few days before a cruise. Since the Ridge had “contactless check-in,” we had received two codes to get in the front entrance and our room. When we arrived after midnight, we had no problems getting into the hotel with the first code. But we couldn’t get into our room with the second code. There were no staff on duty, so we called the hotel’s number. But the woman who answered could not help and subsequent calls went to voice mail. I also sent messages through the Booking.com app, the online travel agency with which we made the reservation, but the staff there couldn’t solve the issue. So we spent the night in the hotel’s breakfast room, where the restroom also required a code that we did not have. The next morning, the hotel staff sent an apologetic message with the right code, and promised us a refund for that night, about $215. But we never got the money, even though the hotel insists they returned it to Booking. Can you help?

Inside the property’s original neo-Gothic villa are preserved frescoes and wood-beamed coffered ceilings along with Etruscan terra-cotta floor tiling and furniture covered in fabrics handwoven at a nearby textile atelier. Between meals at Cedri, a fine-dining restaurant placed in a former limonaia (lemon greenhouse), and L’Osteria del Borgo, an all-day trattoria serving Neapolitan pizzas, guests can visit the wellness spa — complete with saunas, a salt room and an outdoor solarium — or visit the Italian-style gardens of the surrounding 40-acre park.

But it is perhaps better understood as a fantasy comedy because not only does it break with history, it breaks with reality: It is Tudor palace intrigue with shape-shifting, a joyful and breathless more-more-more.

2024-07-19,A Masterpiece of 20th-Century Sculpture That You Can Wear Around Your Neck,"In 1952, the German-French artist Jean Arp made several trips to Greece, where he encountered the ideas of Claudius Ptolemy, the Greco-Roman astronomer, mathematician and geographer best known for his maps of the stars, which date to the second century A.D. Arp had helped found the radical Dada art movement in Zurich in 1916 and went on to become a leading Surrealist, but by this stage of his career, he was most preoccupied with the forms of the natural world — a fascination that he recognized in Ptolemy’s work. Some years later, back at the artist’s studio just outside of Paris, this discovery would inform Arp’s “Ptolémée” series of abstract sculptures, including “Ptolémée II” (1958), a roughly three-foot-tall biomorphic bronze that is widely considered to be among his masterworks. If Ptolemy hoped to reveal the contours of the universe in maps and treatises, Arp, who died in 1966 at 79, sought to render them in solid, three-dimensional form.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/t-magazine/celine-jean-arp-ptolemy-necklace.html

Its Glow House spa has four treatment rooms, each with its own terrace, and a private swimming pool overlooking Provence. In Nice’s old town, Hôtel du Couvent opened last month within a 17th-century convent surrounded by two-and-a-half acres of gardens.

The federal court that granted his release did so on certain conditions. One of these was that he must not speak to the media.

Trifle Is the Dessert of the Summer.","In classic British fashion, the trifle — perhaps the most quintessentially English dessert — is an almost comical understatement, its name suggesting a light snack when the dish itself is an indulgent, multilayered, alcohol-soaked production. The moniker was more accurate in the 16th century, when it referred to a simple pudding made from clotted cream mixed with sugar and rosewater. But in the Victorian era, the trifle evolved into a more elaborate creation: leftover cake or biscuits piled into a generous, footed glass bowl, saturated with a fortified white wine known as “sack” and sandwiched between fresh fruit, custard, jelly (gelatin made from calves’ feet), syllabub (alcohol-infused whipped cream) and a precursor to modern-day sprinkles made from caraway seeds coated in colored sugar. According to the English food historian Ivan Day, while the exact origins of the confection are unknown, it likely evolved from an amalgamation of several desserts. “On an aristocratic table in 18th-century England you’d have a range of different sweets: biscuits, which they dipped into wineglasses, jellies, custards, syllabub and coated caraway seeds to freshen breath and aid with digestion,” he says. “Trifle became all those dishes mixed together in a bowl.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/t-magazine/trifle-dessert-english.html
