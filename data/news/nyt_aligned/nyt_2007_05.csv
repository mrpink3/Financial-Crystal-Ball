Corzine’s out-of-state travel during his tenure as governor of New Jersey referred erroneously in some copies to the time he has spent outside the state.

The article also rendered incorrectly comments on the matter from Zulima V. Farber, then the New Jersey attorney general, in an April 2006 memo. She wrote, “We do not believe that, in the circumstances you describe, an occasional, overnight stay in New York City following a workday in New Jersey and a return to this state in the morning constitutes an absence of the governor that would trigger the devolution of gubernatorial power.” The erroneous version said “circumstance” instead of “circumstances” and omitted the words “and a return.”",Corrections,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/pageoneplus/02corrections-ART-004.html

The London judge, Peter Smith, ruled that Mr. Chiluba, in power from 1991 to 2001, “was uniquely positioned to stop corruption” in government, but that he elected instead to join in it. Zambia’s government sued in London because it alleged that Mr. Chiluba and his associates had bought assets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr. Chiluba said in a statement that he did not recognize a British court’s authority in Zambian issues, arguing that the case circumvented Zambia’s justice system. Other African experts said the verdict, the first against a current or former head of state, could set an anticorruption precedent.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/world/africa/05briefs-zambia.html

The cost of Merck’s drugs has been $580 annually per patient. Brazil said the company had offered a 30 percent discount, but the government opted instead to buy the generic version from India for less than $170. For years, Brazil has considered exercising its rights under international trade rules to make or import generic versions of patented AIDS drugs, but has until now backed away, fearing trade retaliation from the United States. For more than a decade, Brazil has provided universal free access to drug treatment for people with AIDS. Almost one in four patients in Brazil are now taking efavirenz. With the new price, Brazil estimates that it will save $237 million on efavirenz by 2012 when the patent expires.

Derived from a Latin root meaning “earth,” terroir describes the relationship between a wine and the specific place that it comes from. For example, many will say the characteristic minerality of wines from Chablis comes from the limestone beds beneath the vineyards (although, when pressed, they generally admit that they’ve never actually tasted limestone). The idea that one can taste the earth in a wine is appealing, a welcome link to nature and place in a delocalized world; it has also become a rallying cry in an increasingly sharp debate over the direction of modern winemaking. The trouble is, it’s not true.",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/style/tmagazine/06tdirt.html

He took himself, and his new poetry, back home to Muslim Spain. There, despite the dismay his mediocre verses prompted in other aspiring Hebrew poets, his style caught on. Within a few decades, from these unpromising origins, a brilliant and original body of Hebrew verse began to take shape. Virtually stagnant since late Biblical times, Hebrew poetry and the language itself would be transformed by a succession of poets of genius and their imitators.

2007-05-07,Net Worth," At sunset on a clear June evening, Andrea Fariello steered his small boat to a chosen location two miles from shore. By day Fariello — tall, with rough, sun-stained skin, an unkempt beard and a few blackened teeth from years of smoking — tends his bar along the main strip of Marina di Pisciotta, a sleepy village about 70 miles south of Italy’s Amalfi coast. At night he is one of Marina di Pisciotta’s anchovy fishermen. What sets him apart from the other anchovy fishermen along the Mediterranean coast is that he is among the few who still use the menaica, a net dating to the ancient Romans.

2007-05-07,Dine by Diagram,"Recipics may be an answer to today’s cacophony of culinary chatter. Influenced by the field of instructional design and airplane-emergency-card instructions, the Australian graphic designer Lauren Bugeja began to create recipes using virtually text-free pictograms for a student project at the University of Technology in Sydney. Recently, she teamed up with designers to develop a Web site for sharing recipes and creating recipics (www.coo.kz), which will launch this month. Bugeja says recipics will appeal to visual learners and could also be useful for translating recipes across languages. While steps such as duration, measurement and actions can be diagramed relatively easily, Bugeja acknowledges the occasional stumbling block: “The ingredients are still a work in progress,” she said. “For example, it’s hard to explain the difference between flour, baking powder, anthrax and cocaine without words.”",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/style/tmagazine/06tdiagram.html

Pared-down flights at super-cheap rates, which have been all the rage in Europe for years, will show up in the United States when Skybus Airlines (www.skybus.com) starts domestic operations on May 22. For budget-minded passengers, the compromise seems minimal; reservations must be made through the Web site (no customer relations phone number exists) and there are extra fees for services that are usually part of the fare — like bag check ($5 each for two bags, $50 for additional ones), soft drinks and seating requests. But the flights are cheap. Really cheap. One-way fares start for as little as $10, with a top one-way walk-up fare of $330 (all flights must connect in Columbus, Ohio). Skybus is not serving the New York area, but is flying to nine other cities, including Richmond; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Greensboro, N.C.; San Francisco; and Seattle. ... Tourists who want a break from the slot machines now have the option of bowling in Las Vegas 24 hours a day. Last month, Red Rock Casino, Resort and Spa, about 10 miles off the Strip (www.redrocklasvegas.com), opened a 72-lane bowling center (below). The center has a pro shop, an arcade, meeting rooms, a deli, a lounge and bar, dart boards, billiard tables, a shuffleboard table, plasma televisions and, surprise, slot and video poker games. There is also a 12-lane, nightclub-like V.I.P. suite, which can be subdivided into four or eight lanes for private parties. Three-hour V.I.P. rates range from $1,500 to $4,500; catered food and bottle service are available. Regular rates start at $3 per adult per game. ... All Holiday Inn hotels — nearly 1,000 — will begin serving Rainforest Alliance certified coffee to guests by June. At least 30 percent of the beans used to make the coffee will be grown on farms that have met strict environmental and social standards on issues like worker protection and biodiversity conservation (www.rainforest-alliance.org).

Although the bowls arrived anyway, the starter cellar that Armutcuoglu received ranged from Mouton to the rare Quintarelli amarone. Of course, not everyone has such generous friends, but that doesn’t affect the growing trend of registering for wine. “People want to be different,” said Carley Roney, the editor in chief and co-founder of the bridal magazine The Knot Weddings. “They’re getting married later and already have the espresso machine.” The process often starts with a consultation. Nicole Serle, in charge of wedding registries at Vino in New York, advises requesting an assortment of everyday bottles as well as wines that will appreciate in 5-, 10- and 15-year increments (proper storage is key).

2007-05-07,Stupid and Contagious,"Until I received the assignment to review Everett True’s “Nirvana,” I hadn’t listened to the band much in recent years. In this I suspect I’m like most of us who were in our late teens or early 20s when Nirvana’s singer, songwriter and guitarist, Kurt Cobain, died in April 1994, hardly two and a half years after the release of “Nevermind.” There was so much hype — inevitable word — over Nirvana and its demise that the music later seemed somehow buried beneath the ephemera it occasioned. It became almost embarrassing to listen, in one’s dorm room, to Cobain’s strangely sarcastic and inviting voice, when journalists had called him the voice of our generation. And the band’s tortured ambivalence over its tremendous popularity grew to seem sadly quaint. When “Nevermind” came out, the marketing of the Persian Gulf war as a blockbuster action film was a fresh outrage, as was the recruitment of the Beatles’ song “Revolution” as an advertising jingle; we were not yet thoroughly familiar with the emotional indecency of commercialization. We are now four years into the gulf war’s skillfully marketed sequel, while Cobain’s widow, Courtney Love, has recently licensed her husband’s song “Breed” for use by a manufacturer of video games. How to listen to the anthems of the early ’90s in what are already the late ’00s? What does “Smells Like Teen Spirit” sound like when you’re in your 30s, as Kurt Cobain, dead at 27, of course will never be? ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/books/review/Kunkel.t.html

In place of balloons and goody bags, this one had a working title — “El Ataque de los Trapos” (“The Attack of the Cleaning Cloths”) — and would be filmed using seven movie cameras, all borrowed for the occasion.

2007-05-07,Why Not the Worst?,"Last year, I stumbled upon a remarkable book called “The Talisman of Troy.” Written by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, “The Talisman of Troy” chronicled the adventures of Diomedes, a second-tier hero in the “Iliad,” after the fall of Troy. Bristling with sentences like “Anchialus shuddered: in that boy was the awesome power of the son of Peleus, but not a crumb of his father’s piety, nor his hospitable manners,” the novel advanced the theory that Helen of Troy had not really been abducted by Paris, son of Priam, but had deliberately gone to Asia Minor in order to get her hands on a sacred totem — the talisman of Troy — that would enable women to rule the world. The book is thus one of life’s unalloyed pleasures: an uncompromisingly stupid novel in a world filled with stupid novels that do make compromises. And, by virtue of its faux Hellenic inanity and all-purpose Delphic hootiness, it is also a powerful weapon in the hands of those of us who work night and day to resist the tyranny of the good.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/books/review/Queenan.t.html

Located in Big Sur, California, just off Highway 1 on approximately one hundred and fifty acres of stunning natural beauty, Esalen is, geographically speaking, a cliff suspended about one hundred feet above the crashing surf and kelp-congested tides of the Pacific Ocean. By all measures, it is a stunning place, replete with natural beauty and a certain physical paradox, partly produced by the proximate presence of mountains and ocean; indeed, the rocky heights seem to drop directly into the watery depths here or, more true to the place's primeval geological history, it is as if the heights rise up out of the depths. Henry Miller called Big Sur ""a religion where extremes meet."" Indeed. The physical paradox of the land is deepened further by a simple, but somehow profound, historical and geographic fact: these, after all, are grounds that both constitute the very edge of the American frontier and look due west to see the East. Certainly Walter Truett Anderson had it right when he wrote, ""If a place can have charisma, then surely this one has it.""

It was the voice of an old, familiar ghost, and it spoke to me as I stumbled through waist-high drifts in the blizzard of '96. According to newscasters, this was the worst snowstorm to hit New York in decades. Parked cars on Tenth Avenue were visible only as little bumps on the white, silent landscape. And still it came down, big wind-whipped flakes that nipped my cheeks and scrambled my senses. I wasn't exactly homeless, but some instinct had been driving me through the streets, hunched into the storm. There was little refuge back where I'd come from.

2007-05-07,‘Rethinking Thin’," If you met Carmen J. Pirollo, you might not realize that he has a weight problem. He's a square-jawed, animated man, who talks in exclamation points, favors preppy clothes, and-the big hint that he's a bit self-conscious-sometimes doesn't tuck in his shirts. Yet while you may notice his abdomen under that shirt, he is not what you might think of as obese. He does not seem to have any trouble moving, and when he sits down, he does not spill out of his chair. He's not like one of the subjects in those insulting, deliberately humiliating photos that show up in magazine articles or on television programs to illustrate the horrors of the obesity epidemic-those familiar images of round-faced, double-chinned people captured stuffing hamburgers into their mouths or of a fat family lumbering past fast food restaurants, dipping into bags of popcorn or licking ice cream cones.

What does any of this have to do with atoms? Fair question. I’d like to start my answer by telling you about a strange phenomenon in Spitsbergen.Spitsbergen is a Norwegian island in the Svalbard archipelago. It has spectacular mountains, abundant glaciers and desolate tundra, where stones are littered over a flat and mostly featureless terrain. In places on this tundra, the stones are arranged in a remarkable way; they lie not in a chaotic, haphazard jumble but in an ordered array of hauntingly beautiful, nearly perfect circular piles.

2007-05-08,Manhattan Court Upholds School Cellphone Ban,"A State Supreme Court justice ruled yesterday that New York City’s rule prohibiting students from bringing cellphones to public schools was “rational,” rejecting an effort by parents who had sought to overturn the ban. In a 50-page decision, the justice, Lewis Bart Stone, said the court could decide only whether the rule was a reasonable way to prevent students from using cellphones in school and that he could not suggest a different rule, even if he preferred one. “The court finds that banning possession in the school is not an irrational method to accomplish such goal,” he wrote. Justice Stone also rejected a claim that the rule violated students’ and parents’ constitutional rights. “Neither the state nor federal constitutions include any express constitutional right to bear cellphones,” he wrote. Norman Siegel, above, a lawyer for the parents, said they were considering an appeal. “We will not rest until the ban is lifted,” he said. David Cantor, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joel I.

Starting at 10, Hepburn joins forces with Cary Grant in three classic comedies: “Bringing Up Baby” (1938), above, about a scatterbrain who uses her pet leopard to catch the attention of a starchy paleontologist; “Holiday” (1938), in which a freethinker engaged to a millionaire’s daughter decides that her sister just might be a better match, at 1:15 a.m.; and “The Philadelphia Story” (1940), about an ice princess socialite on the verge of remarrying who is forced to rethink everything, at 3. At midnight there’s Hepburn’s first television interview, on “The Dick Cavett Show,” from 1973. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/arts/television/09tvcol.html

As Everett sits in his apartment, reading the paper and sipping a martini, a pair of warm eyes unexpectedly meets his, and his world turns from blasé to rosé. “Everett experienced an unfamiliar sensation,” Schine writes. “He was suddenly, intensely aware of the room around him, of the soft order of his furnishings and his life, of the soft order outside where day was giving way to night, of the TV sounds and the cold wet of the martini glass, of the smudgy feel of newsprint on his fingers, but mostly he was aware of joy — the wild, clattering joy of being alive. ‘Howdy,’ he whispered.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

Written in language whose rhythms felt true to the way kids talked, from the point of view of Ponyboy Curtis, a bright, idealistic 14-year-old who veers dangerously close to ending up on the wrong side of the law, “The Outsiders” had the vitality and the audacity of rock ’n’ roll — partly because Hinton was a teenager herself when she wrote it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Zacharek-t.html

2007-05-14,"Sex, Drugs and Updating Your Blog","Jonathan Coulton sat in Gorilla Coffee in Brooklyn, his Apple PowerBook open before him, and began slogging through the day’s e-mail. Coulton is 36 and shaggily handsome. In September 2005, he quit his job as a computer programmer and, with his wife’s guarded blessing, became a full-time singer and songwriter. He set a quixotic goal for himself: for the next year, he would write and record a song each week, posting each one to his blog. “It was a sort of forced-march approach to creativity,” he admitted to me over the sound of the cafe’s cappuccino frothers. He’d always wanted to be a full-time musician, and he figured the only way to prove to himself he could do it was with a drastic challenge. “I learned that it is possible to squeeze a song out of just about anything,” he said. “But it’s not always an easy or pleasant process.” Given the self-imposed time constraints, the “Thing a Week” songs are remarkably good. Coulton tends toward geeky, witty pop tunes: one song, “Tom Cruise Crazy,” is a sympathetic ode to the fame-addled star, while “Code Monkey” is a rocking anthem about dead-end programming jobs. By the middle of last year, his project had attracted a sizable audience. More than 3,000 people, on average, were visiting his site every day, and his most popular songs were being downloaded as many as 500,000 times; he was making what he described as “a reasonable middle-class living” — between $3,000 and $5,000 a month — by selling CDs and digital downloads of his work on iTunes and on his own site.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/magazine/13audience-t.html

The men were there to bid on the foreclosed contents of the first storage locker up for auction — essentially panning for gold.

The impressively wacky premise is that after the Holocaust, large numbers of Jews were relocated to Sitka, where by statute they were allowed to make their home for the next 60 years, at the end of which the town would revert to the control of Alaska. Israel, it appears, didn’t work out: the Jewish settlers there were ejected “with savage finality” in 1948. “The Holy Land,” the novel tells us, “has never seemed more remote or unattainable than it does to a Jew of Sitka.” The godforsakenness of the place is something more than a figure of speech.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Rafferty-t.html

Bush’s only act of unabashed environmentalism. But amid the easy island music and Laura Bush’s descriptions of the Laysan albatross (“who mate for life”), the significance of the monument felt buried. More than a native Hawaiian cultural heritage site, more than a nesting area for endangered albatrosses, Papahanaumokuakea represents something unique in U.S. conservation history: the first large-scale territorial victory of fish over fishermen.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/magazine/13wwln-lede-t.html

Like a funhouse mirror, prison reflects and distorts the darkest impulses of women, and of the culture in which they maneuver.

Ansky) about women who are looking forward to marriage. Rachel Dickstein, the show’s inventor and the founder of the company Ripe Time, has developed a distinctive stage language, simple yet effective, overlapping words with movement, poetic image with sound (the score is by the jazz pianist and composer Vijay Iyer). From the opening tableau of three women half-suspended within rectangular openings in the back wall, bathed in a haze of sepia light, while the cellist Greg Heffernan and the flutist Natacha Diels gently feel out lines of electronically enhanced music, it’s clear this is going to be a sensual, beautiful evening.

I find the suggestion that Hagel’s run would hurt a Republican presidential candidate, which I’ve seen in a couple of places, rather ludicrous. Hagel is widely despised within the party, and the last poll I saw had him at 1% among Republicans. My guess is that a large majority of those “yearning” for a Hagel candidacy would otherwise vote for the Democrat.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/hagel-bloomberg-a-threat-to-which-party/

It was a quick and dirty experience but surprisingly efficient. Now things are more complicated. If you’re on an international flight you’re likely to arrive at the sprawling new airport, Suvarnabhumi (airport code BKK), which is east of the city. Don Muang carries the airport code DMK and is used mainly for domestic flights. Study your tickets carefully, especially if you’re changing planes (it takes at least an hour to travel between airports). Here’s the most important thing to know about Suvarnabhumi: it’s pronounced Sawana-phoom. If you pronounce it the way it’s spelled, no one will understand you. Peak time for international flights at Suvarnabhumi is the evening. Check-in lines, especially for Thai Airways, which now uses the single check-in line system, can be very long.

She went on to write a seminar paper about him, then a senior thesis, then a Ph.D. dissertation at Yale, then a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography. Beecher, she said in an e-mail message, is “a bit like the Forrest Gump of the 19th century, popping into all the great debates of the era, from the noble, like the antislavery or woman suffrage movements, to the frivolous, like whether women should wear bloomers.” Applegate doesn’t have a new project in mind yet. “In some ways, finishing a book after spending 20 years on a subject is like breaking up with a longtime boyfriend — you need a little breather before jumping back into a new relationship,” she said.

Robert Kennedy gravitated immediately to a shadowy nexus of forces he believed were at odds with the policies of his brother’s administration. Was it the C.I.A.? he asked John McCone, the director of central intelligence. Was the assassination the work of anti-Castro Cubans? Was it the American Mafia? Or was it — since there were hidden but important connections among these groups — a combined effort by them all? Before he had ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald, Robert Kennedy was considering scenarios that would eventually become the foundation of the myriad conspiracy theories that have haunted the American imagination for more than 40 years; according to David Talbot, he continued to explore those scenarios until his own death in 1968, even while publicly denying his belief in a conspiracy.

Renegade foot soldiers bash his sister’s head in and rape and kill his mother.

2007-05-21,The Nuclear Threat,"One need read only the first three pages of “The Atomic Bazaar” to be reminded of William Langewiesche’s formidable talent as a journalist whose cool, precise and economical reporting is harnessed to an invigorating moral and intellectual perspective on the world he describes. In a single paragraph, he lucidly explains the basic physics of the uranium-based atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Once a professional pilot, and the author of “Inside the Sky,” Langewiesche then leads the reader inside the “pressurized, well-heated” cockpit of the Enola Gay, flying at 31,000 feet in “smooth air,” piloted by the young Colonel Paul Tibbets, and vividly reconstructs the evasive maneuver taken by the B-29 as it banks steeply to minimize the coming shockwaves, while the bomb, named Little Boy, falls for 43 seconds before igniting several miles below, lighting the sky with “the prettiest blues and pinks that Tibbets had ever seen.” Tibbets’s subsequent career, from Air Force general to Internet purveyor of autographed souvenirs of that momentous flight, is adroitly sketched. The bombing of Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima, with a plutonium device, is handled in brisk but sufficient detail. Langewiesche counts the total killed in the two attacks (around 220,000), then delivers his own one-sentence bomb: “The intent was to terrorize a nation to the maximum extent, and there is nothing like nuking civilians to achieve that effect.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/books/review/Raban-t.html

2007-05-21,The Native Builder,"Having lived to testify, I can assure you that Glenn Murcutt is not as bad a driver as everyone says he is. Not quite, anyway. On a sunny afternoon toward the end of the Australian summer, he piloted his wife’s MG down from Sydney through the New South Wales countryside, where several examples of his architecture — a few houses and a small arts center — lie scattered about the countryside like so many jewels in the grass. “I’ve had a number of accidents, but I’ve never wiped the car out,” he said, and in truth, the ride was less frightening than exhausting. But it was a trial, an erratic wending through a lovely green landscape, full of sudden accelerations and stops, tight turns and lane dodges, lost directions and carefree distractions, all of it magnified by his tendency to stay in third gear whether we were going 10 miles an hour or 50, to drum his thumbs on the steering wheel and to talk about everything, all at once.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/magazine/20murcutt-t.html

2007-05-21,Inside the List,"RALPH AND WRIGHT: “I wish I’d written that.” It’s a thought everyone has a couple of times a year, upon reading something particularly great. In the winter of 1952, the Book Review asked 12 writers with new books in stores to single out another book, published that year, that they wished they’d written. The answers bordered on the bizarre. John Steinbeck praised Al Capp’s dialogue in his “Li’l Abner” cartoons. Tallulah Bankhead said she envied Adlai Stevenson’s campaign speeches. Edna Ferber singled out her own novel “Giant.” (C’mon, people.) Then there was Ralph Ellison, whose first novel, “Invisible Man,” had been published earlier that year. The book Ellison said he wished he’d written was Wright Morris’s novel “The Works of Love.” This made a certain amount of sense; Morris was a forceful and worthy, if ultimately minor, writer. Ellison’s pick made even more sense if you recalled that Morris had effusively reviewed Ellison’s own novel in the Book Review, calling it “a resolutely honest, tormented, profoundly American book.” As lit-crimes go, Ellison’s back-scratching was barely a misdemeanor. But for more on Ellison’s rough edges, see Brent Staples’s review of Arnold Rampersad’s new biography.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/books/review/20tbr.html

The place did yield my wife and her cousins some fond childhood memories. But in the wake of various divorces and moves, the cabin was soon abandoned, allowed to go to such utter ruin that by the mid-80s, only the equivalent collapse of our Brooklyn neighborhood into drug-related violence would prompt us to think of a rundown cabin as idyllic.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/magazine/20lives-t.html

But a civic revival, which began with the harbor's makeover 27 years ago, has given out-of-towners reason to visit. Yes, there are wonderful seafood restaurants, Colonial history, quaint waterfronts and other tourist-ready attractions. But Baltimore's renaissance has also cultivated cool restaurants with innovative cuisine, independent theaters that showcase emerging talent and galleries that specialize in contemporary art.

2007-05-21,Denver’s Mile-High Style,"When Jennifer Roberts opened Composition (1) in 2003, a modern design store was a hard sell in Denver. The city was still driven by outdoor sports; few went looking for Karim Rashid piggy banks. “I was a few years too early,” says Roberts of her shop (7180 W. Alaska Drive, Belmar; 303-894-0025). But, with Daniel Libeskind's museum complete, one by David Adjaye on the way and a handful of major hotels scheduled to open in the next three years, Denver is emerging as a style-conscious city with great shopping. Along with the three-year-old fashion boutique Skye (2) (1499 Blake Street; 303-623-0444), still the only game in town for avant-garde labels like Alexandre Herchcovitch and Heatherette, there's the Fabric Lab (3105 East Colfax Avenue; 303-321-3604) and Fancy Tiger (1 South Broadway; 303-733-3855). Both cater to hipsters interested in reworked vintage clothes and printed tees from local labels like Potential Fashions and Hecklewood. And in the fast-gentrifying downtown, the high-end sneaker shop the 400 (3) opened a second Denver location (2445 Larimer Street; 303-292-2646), near the former Brooklynite Paul Hardt's gallery and furniture shop, P Design Gallery (4) (2590 Walnut Street; 720-259-2516), which has introduced Coloradans to the likes of Tobi Wong and FredriksonStallard.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/travel/tmagazine/07remix-denver-t.html

A long central hallway drew breezes through, offering relief from steamy Maryland summers. Sometimes, I can still almost hear the ghosts of the original owners, offering advice born of long experience: On a hot July morning, close the front shutters, open the hall doors at both ends, raise the upstairs sashes to catch the southerly breeze. My house’s walls were built of bricks fired on the spot from the same clayey soil that had been dug out to form the cellar, so that I think of it as something like a sand castle, sculptured from its surrounding earth.

More than just a charming tradition, the child’s play commemorates a key victory in a hard-fought, ongoing war. Back in 1972, the new mayor of the city, an architect and urban planner named Jaime Lerner, ordered a lightning transformation of six blocks of the street into a pedestrian zone. The change was recommended in a master plan for the city that was approved six years earlier, but fierce objections from the downtown merchants blocked its implementation. Lerner instructed his secretary of public works to institute the change quickly and asked how long it would take. “He said he needed four months,” Lerner recalled recently. “I said, ‘Forty-eight hours.’ He said, ‘You’re crazy.’ I said, ‘Yes, I’m crazy, but do it in 48 hours.’ ” The municipal authorities were able to accomplish it in three days, beginning on a Friday night and installing paving, lighting, planters and furniture by the end of the day on Monday. “Being a very weak mayor, if I start to do it and take too long, everyone could stop it through a juridical demand,” Lerner went on to explain. “If they stop the work, it’s finished. I had to do it very fast, at least in part. Because we had discussed it a great deal.

2007-05-21,My Dear Fellow Species," THE Origin of Species” is almost 150 — a fit survivor of the science canon even if not everyone has seen fit to jump from the Ark to the Beagle on the matter of evolution (three Republican presidential candidates, for example). But Darwin himself was slow to come to his ideas, and slower still to disclose them to a skeptical public. Last week, the Darwin Correspondence Project, based at Cambridge University, put about 5,000 letters to and from Darwin, some of them previously unpublished, online at darwinproject.ac.uk, with thousands more to follow. The searchable database lets anyone track the painstaking development of his research and thinking — on all kinds of topics, personal and professional, and with a huge array of correspondents.

2007-05-21,‘The Atomic Bazaar’," Hiroshima was destroyed in a flash by a bomb dropped from a propeller-driven B-29 of the U.S. Army Air Corps, on the warm morning of Monday, August 6, 1945. The bomb was not chemical, as bombs until then had been, but atomic, designed to release the energies that Einstein had described. It was a simple cannon-type device of the sort that today any number of people could build in a garage. It was bulbous and black, about ten feet long, and weighed ninety-seven hundred pounds. It fell nose-down for forty-three seconds and, for maximum effect, never hit the ground. One thousand nine hundred feet above the city it fired a dull gray plug of highly enriched uranium down a steel tube into a receiving lump of the same refined material, creating a combined uranium mass of 133 pounds. In relation to its surface area, that mass was more than enough to achieve ""criticality"" and allow for an uncontrollable chain of fission reactions, during which subatomic particles called neutrons collided with uranium nuclei, releasing further neutrons, which collided with other nuclei, in a blossoming process of self-destruction. The reactions could be sustained for just a millisecond, and they fully exploited less than two pounds of the uranium atoms before the resulting heat forced a halt to the process through expansion. Uranium is one of the heaviest elements on earth, almost twice as heavy as lead, and two pounds of it amounts to only about three tablespoonfuls. Nonetheless the release of energy over Hiroshima yielded a force equivalent to fifteen thousand tons (fifteen kilotons) of TNT, achieved temperatures higher than the sun's, and emitted light-speed pulses of lethal radiation. More than 150,000 people died. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/books/chapters/0520-1st-lang.html

They reaped the rewards of their grandfather's financial acumen, legal expertise, and common sense; and Sterling and Stephen, if not the other two, also felt the imprint of Edward's personality. While on the surface Edward, a Sunday-school teacher as well as a lawyer, was a man of traditional bearing who comported himself with conservative demeanor, he was intensely strong-willed, determined, and uncompromising, as well as crafty. Even if their own father, Edward's son Alfred, was a bird of a different feather, Edward's triumph in the world of commerce gave Sterling and Stephen their mettle and sense of entitlement.

His eyes were nearly useless when I met him, and were it not for his condition, I would never have known about Herman Melville's lost book. Walter Geist's blindness is important, but it's my own, with regard to him, that remains a lasting regret. It's the reason for this story.

The two stopped again yesterday and circled a river channel near Rio Vista, apparently hesitant to swim under an open drawbridge, the authorities said. The whales, injured by a boat propeller, have passed the bridge several times, but always retreated upstream.

2007-05-22,The Meaning of ‘Democrat’ in Montana,"If any state symbolizes the new Democratic Congressional majority, it might be Montana: a former Republican bastion that now has two Democrats, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, in the Senate. Matt Singer at Left in the West however, is beginning to have qualms about the sort of Democrats that get elected in conservative states. He considers the two Montanans’ votes against the Reid-Feingold bill, which would have put a timeline on funding for the war in Iraq, to be partisan treason. There’s a couple problems with this — first and foremost, it’s misleading. As a staffer from one of their offices told me himself, there’s this whole false understanding that passing Feingold-Reid would literally mean that tanks in Iraq would start running out of gas and the like. That’s simply not true — and it’s not how our government actually operates. Our Senators shouldn’t perpetuate myths.Second, they’re both using common right-wing attacks to undermine progressive Democratic leadership. They could have both simply said, “My position is that the President and the Pentagon need to come up with a plan. This bill doesn’t accomplish that.” Instead, they threw in a gratuitous, “Leading members of my own party want to ‘pull out the rug’ on our troops in a way that ‘I believe compromises the safety and security of our troops on the ground.'” Those are Mitch McConnell’s talking points.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/the-meaning-of-democrat-in-montana/

Presidents, of course, have always made decisions with an eye on their popularity. But with the advent of television, polling, and professional consultants, presidents of the 1970s and ’80s—Nixon, Carter, and Reagan in particular—upped the ante by devoting the full arsenal of modern electioneering tools not just to winning office but to holding office as well.Recently, the permanent campaign has added yet another stage—a final frontier. This is the fight for history, centered on the presidents’ libraries. The presidential libraries date from 1939, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt conceived his as a repository for his public papers, to be built with private funds and run by public officials. Since then, chief executives have sought to outdo their predecessors by entombing their archives in extravagant, self-memorializing shrines. These museums extend the permanent campaign by utilizing the same public relations techniques as a race for the White House—and lately requiring comparable fundraising efforts to boot.",Opinion,https://campaigningforhistory.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/bush-wars-the-final-frontier/

The D.N.C. has raised $19.7 million this year and had available cash of $6.1 million, with debts of $3 million.The D.N.C. has lower cash on hand than the R.N.C. because it has spent a greater percentage of its receipts — in part because the D.N.C. pays salaries for party personnel in all 50 states.

If the deal closes, it is likely to be the most expensive sale ever of an apartment in Manhattan. It would also break the record set by Daniel Loeb, the head of the hedge fund Third Point Capital, who is known for his exquisitely barbed letters to corporate managers.

2007-05-23,Modern Art and Old Rome (2):Chagall,"If you are shopping on Via Corso or heading back to town from the Coloseum or the Imperial Forum, stop at the wonderful temporary Chagall retrospective exhibit in the Museo Del Risorgimento. The museum is entered through the back side of Rome’s ugliest monument, Il Vittoriano, a bright white late 19th Century creation to commemorate Italian unification. (For those who have just done the Schnabel exhibit, Il Vittoriano is the bright white monstrosity right across Piazza Venezia.) The Chagalls could be better organized and displayed, but there are dozens of terrific paintings spanning 6 decades of the artist’s work. Particularly interesting for those in Rome who are overdosed on traditional religious art, are Chagall’s unconventional renderings of the Bible, in which Jesus is shown with all the trappings of Judaism (notice the Torah), placed in what looks like Chagall’s birthplace in a village in Russia. To finish your visit, head upstairs to the museum’s outdoor cafe, on a terrace overlooking the ruins of the Imperial Forum. The coffee is excellent. The sangria not bad. Most important, the terrace has one of the best panoramas of Rome, with excellent signs that help you make sense of the forest of spires and arches you are seeing. Just FYI this outing is very kid-friendly; I did this one with my 15-year-old, who loved both the art and the view.

2007-05-24,Banking on the Democrats,"Who’s going to be the big winner in the ‘08 presidential election? Your bank account — if you follow Greg Mankiw’s advice, that is. A reader tipped Mankiw off to the fact that ”for the 2008 elections, [TradeSports.com’s Intrade site] has approximately a 40 percent chance of Hillary being president and a 50 percent chance of her being the democratic nominee. With the Democrats having about a 57 percent chance of winning the election and with Obama and Gore having above 50 percent chances of winning, the 80 percent (40/50) that Hillary has looks awfully suspect and I assume someone is manipulating the 40 percent number to make Hillary look better. With the efficient market hypothesis in mind, is this at all possible or is an arbitrage opportunity available?”Mankiw tells us how to use this anomaly to our advantage: Sell Clinton (bid is now 38.3), Obama (16.5), Gore (7.3), and Edwards (3.6) for a total of 65.7. Buy a contract for a generic Democratic win (ask is now 56.8). You pocket the difference (65.7-56.8=8.9). You have to pay out on the first contract if one of these four candidates wins, but in that case you are covered by the second contract. The only contingency in which you lose is if Clinton, Obama, Gore, or Edwards end up president as an independent or Republican candidate, which seems completely unlikely.So why am I giving away this arbitrage opportunity for free?

2007-05-28,Inside the List,"LEONARD’S FINAL FOUR: What’s Elmore Leonard’s best novel? In the right bar, that question could start a rumble. But Mark Reiter tackles it with elegance and wit in his recent book “The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything,” which he wrote with Richard Sandomir and Nigel Holmes. According to Reiter, the novels that make it to Leonard’s final four are “Hombre” (1961), “Swag” (1976), “LaBrava” (1983) and “Killshot” (1989). It’s hard to quibble with that list. “LaBrava” got there by defeating, in the second round, “Get Shorty.” (Reiter calls this “an ironic matchup, since Leonard wrote ‘Get Shorty’ to get back at Dustin Hoffman for torturing him during the writing of the ‘LaBrava’ screenplay.”) The final matchup, in Reiter’s bracket, is between “Swag” and “Killshot.” I’ll let Reiter describe which book wins: “ ‘Swag’ is great because you root for the crooks. ‘Killshot’ goes it one better with Leonard’s best-ever opening chapter, a cast of kinky characters who are both menacing and sympathetic, and the rarity of a happily married couple as the novel’s action heroes. Even the blunt title is perfect.” Leonard’s new novel, “Up in Honey’s Room,” is at No. 15.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/27tbr.html

I initially mistook Tehran’s most popular bookstore, with its windows full of weathered copper pots and other bric-a-brac, for an antique shop. Inside, the floor space dedicated to books was roughly a quarter of that taken up by kilims, cactuses and Lego sets. “I’m embarrassed to call myself a bookseller,” one store owner told me recently, gazing at the wall of Hello Kitty accessories that dominated his shop.

2007-05-28,"‘The Perfect Summer: England 1911, Just Before the Storm’"," On the first day of May 1911 temperatures throughout England began to rise, and everyone agreed that the world was becoming exceedingly beautiful. The cold weather of April had held back the flowering of many of the spring bulbs, and with the warmth of the first week of summer there had been a sudden burst of growth. The verges of the country lanes were frothing with cow parsley while late primroses still dotted the roadside banks. Top-hatted men strolling in the London parks had decided it was warm enough to abandon their scarves. Straw-bonneted women had gathered up country bluebells to sell in wilting bunches on street corners in the smarter parts of London, and window boxes were already spilling over with scarlet geraniums and marguerites. Tiny pink flowers covered the branches that would later produce crab apples, while the ocean of white blossoms produced by other fruit trees had prompted Country Life to declare that 'few people can remember any parallel to its profusion.' England was plump with promise. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/chapters/0527-1st-nico.html
2007-05-28,‘The Occupation of Iraq’," Conflicts and wars fought on its territory have always been the lot of Iraq. It has had the geographic misfortune of lying across the fault lines of civilisations and empires, and its peoples have suffered the waves of conquerors and battles fought over its lands. The ebb and flow of powers that controlled its destiny always left behind a residue that helped to form the profile of the modern Iraqi. But these were not accretions that melded together to form a common sense of nationhood. The shared history and experiences of Iraqis did not give rise to unifying national myths. The legacy of pre-Islamic civilisations - of Sumer, Babylon and Nineveh - was not one that could be readily adapted to the formation of national identity. The pride that came from knowing that Iraq was the land that gave humanity settled agriculture, its first cities and the alphabet, was not internalised. Iraq's ancient history featured only on the periphery of the identity of Muslim Iraqis. Various modern governments have tried to make the connection and continuity with this heritage - sometimes ludicrously, as when Saddam Hussein appropriated the heritage of the lawmaker Hammurrabi and stuck his name on the (rebuilt) walls of Babylon. But it was never pursued with the intent of forming a national consciousness. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/chapters/0527-1st-alla.html
2007-05-28,‘The Canon’," When the second of her two children turned thirteen, my sister decided that it finally was time to let their membership lapse in two familiar family haunts: the science museum and the zoo. These were kiddie places, she told me. Her children now had more mature tastes. They liked refined forms of entertainment - art museums, the theater, ballet. Isn't that something? My sister's children's bodies were lengthening, and so were their attention spans. They could sit for hours at a performance of Macbeth without so much as checking the seat bottom for fossilized wads of gum. No more of this mad pinball pinging from one hands-on science exhibit to the next, pounding on knobs to make artificial earthquakes, or cranking gears to see Newton's laws in motion, or something like that; who bothers to read the explanatory placards anyway? And, oops, hmm, hey, Mom, this thing seems to have stopped working! No more aping the gorillas or arguing over the structural basis of a polar bear's white coat or wondering about the weird goatee of drool gathering on the dromedary's chin. Sigh. How winged are the slippers of time, how immutably forward point their dainty steel-tipped toe boxes.

2007-05-28,‘The Last Tycoons’," Even among the great Wall Street firms-Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch-Lazard Frères & Co. stood apart, explicitly priding itself on being different from, and superior to, its competitors. For 157 years, Lazard had punched above its weight. Unlike other Wall Street banks, it competed with intellectual rather than financial capital and through a hard-won tradition of privacy and independence. Its strategy, put simply, was to offer clients the wisdom of its Great Men, the finest and most experienced collection of investment bankers the world had ever known. They risked no capital, offering only the raw Darwinian power of their ideas. The better the idea, and the insights and tactics required to achieve the result contemplated by it, the greater was Lazard's currency as a valued and trusted adviser-and the larger were the piles of money the Great Men hauled out of the firm and into their swelling bank accounts. The lucky few men-yes, always men-at Wall Street's summit have always been portrayed as ambitious and brilliant on the one hand and unscrupulous and ruthless on the other. But the secret history of Lazard Frères & Co., the world's most elite and enigmatic investment bank, twists parts of this conventional wisdom into knots of unfathomable complexity. The Great Men chronicled herein amassed huge fortunes-to be sure-but they refused to admit to anyone, least of all to themselves, that their pursuit of these riches led to relentless infighting. Instead they spoke, without irony, of being part of a Florentine guild and of advice whispered to heads of state and to CEOs of the world's most powerful corporations, while all the time attempting to preserve the mythical special idea that was Lazard. They also, to a person, craved an equally elusive chimera: the assurance that somehow, despite everything, they alone had remained virtuous.

Her bared brown shoulders and womanly bosom rose powerfully, as she drew in her breath and gazed across the heads of the seated diners at the distant autocue. She gleamed and rippled with smooth muscle, like a fish. She was boldly dressed, for a woman in her sixties, but she came of a bold generation, and she seemed confident that the shadowy shoals of her cohort were gathered around her in massed support as she flaunted herself upon the podium. She felt the dominion. It pumped through her, filling her with the adrenalin of exposure. She was ready for her leap. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/chapters/0527-1st-drab.html

More than 200 teams compete from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. But the party — on hired junks and yachts ringing the bay, and at packed seaside pubs and restaurants — goes on late into the night.Dragon boating is a little like Western rowing, only spiced up with the chaos of a Chinatown street festival. Up to 20 paddlers cram, in pairs, into long, narrow wooden boats that — to the delight of onlookers — are apt to tipping over at the hands of the unskilled. The front is adorned with a colorful, ornate dragon’s head. This is also where the drummer sits, to beat out time for the rowers to row to. And what’s there not to love about a sport with a designated drummer? At the back is the steerer, like a coxswain.The races are short — sprints, actually — done in heats. It’s simple enough that everyone from the little kids playing on the beach to the drunk guys on their yachts can follow the action.

But the most striking manifestation of that trend for now is the boom in religion in China, and the way most people in most of the country can worship freely most of the time. And I agree with Li Baiguang that in 20 or 30 years China could have several hundred million Christians, making it the largest Christian country in the world. In most of the world, economic development has eroded religious faith, but in China it’s working the other way and there’s a considerable parallel with South Korea and its embrace of Christianity in the 20th century.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/your-comments-on-my-china-religion-column/
