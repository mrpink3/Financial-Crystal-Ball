By that time, the cold fear of the financial crisis was cordoned off in the near-distant past, replaced by a dawning recognition that the ensuing changes in business — the comparatively trifling risk limits, the dwindling bonuses, the elevated stress levels — might actually be permanent. That day, Dimon took the opportunity, according to a bank employee in attendance, to try to inspire his team, to rouse them from the industrywide sense of malaise. Yes, there were challenges, Dimon said, but it was the job of leadership to be strong. They should be prudent, but step up — be bold. He looked out into the audience, where Ina Drew, the 54-year-old chief investment officer, was sitting at one of the tables. “Ina,” he said, singling her out, “is bold.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/ina-drew-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase.html

Gen. John W. Rosa, said. Louis ReVille, 32, a Citadel graduate who became a camp counselor there and an educator at other schools, pleaded guilty in June to 22 counts of child sexual abuse and was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Victims have claimed The Citadel knew Mr. ReVille molested teenagers at a camp in 2002. The college investigated the complaint but did not report it to the police. In September, two other cadets brought sexual assault charges against an older classmate who had made unwanted advances.

The authorities said the items supplied by the executive, Alexander Fishenko, and 10 other people included microprocessors and memory chips that can be used in radar and surveillance systems and detonation triggers. The export of such material is regulated by the federal government for national security reasons, but prosecutors alleged Mr. Fishenko — and several employees of his Houston company, Arc Electronics Inc. — falsified federal export documents and concealed the nature of their work, telling American suppliers that they were not exporters but traffic-light manufacturers. Since 2002, Arc Electronics shipped $50 million worth of microelectronics and other technologies to Russia, with the main port of export being John F.

The study by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy group, says that approach sustains racial diversity and helps poor students. The study was released ahead of arguments, set for next week, before the Supreme Court in a case that could produce new restrictions on considering race in public college admissions.

The first scene, a clever movie within the movie, pretends to show a hand-spliced Super 8 blockbuster made by a boy using toys, a pet dog and limitless ingenuity.

2012-10-05,Good Enough to Eat,"In the last decade or so, Dutch designers became famous for their bold reimaginings and remixings of traditional porcelain decoration. This year, the Amsterdam-based husband-and-wife team of Stefan Scholten and Carole Baijings took that much-copied idea in a more abstract — and strikingly beautiful ­— direction. Scholten and Baijings’s Colour Porcelain dinnerware collection was commissioned by 1616/Arita Japan, a new brand named for the town on the Southern Japanese island of Kyushu that has produced hand-painted porcelain from a stone-based grayish-white clay since the 17th century. Under the creative direction of the up-and-coming young designer Teruhiro Yanagihara, 1616/Arita is putting a contemporary spin on that history. Scholten and Baijings looked at traditional Arita porcelain decoration, deconstructing it into a palette that was surprisingly like their own, which favors tones like aquarelle blue, red-orange and yellow. But instead of applying color just for, say, flowers or figures, they colored entire plates. “The way we used it,” said Baijings of the palette, “it became a lot of color. It’s us, but it’s also Japanese.” The collection is based on three degrees of complexity: the monochromatic Minimal; Colourful, with two or three colors; and Extraordinary, with applied grids, lines and layered colors. These variations make stacking the plates a visual treat. The entire set is also available in plain white, for purists. But those who aren’t afraid of a little color will want to go for the rainbow. From about $22 (for a small white plate) to $675 (for a platter with a grid pattern).

But he was also a generous tutor and giver of books, pressing Turgenev, Goncharov, Mann and others into his son’s hands.

On the one hand, the novel, Meno’s sixth, reads as a parody of self-obsessed art-school types, complete with Serge Gainsbourg posters, self-cut bangs and Velvet Underground records. On the other, it reads as a tribute to their devil-may-care spirit. The book’s alternate titles, “Bohemians” and “Young People on Bicycles Doing Troubling Things,” only add to the confusion, insofar as both seem to wink at the reader.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/books/review/office-girl-by-joe-meno.html

Their attack comes with the blessing (and, more usefully, the munitions) of a quirky retired millionaire who’s devoting his golden years to founding the C.I.A. It’s incredible that this story — or, to be more precise, these stories — hasn’t been told before.

2012-10-05,Straight Out of Brooklyn,"Barbra Streisand’s story may be the most triumphant case of revenge in show business history. In the wake of the white-bread, conformist 1950s, Streisand was the ridiculed young misfit whose every move shrieked defiance. Singing in nightclubs and on television, she faced down audiences with her crossed eyes, beaklike nose and thrift-store costumes. Her voice — big, nasal, braying and edged with her native Brooklynese — was seldom pretty, but it was unmistakably hers, and it riveted the ear with its reckless intensity. Torch songs like “Cry Me a River” and “When the Sun Comes Out” became roller coasters of psycho­drama, yet she never played the victim; one felt her ferociousness ­every time she lurched for a high note, then seized it as though she had scaled the Matterhorn. To her fellow outcasts, from unattractive girls to gay men, Streisand, at 21, was a symbol of victory.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/books/review/hello-gorgeous-becoming-barbra-streisand-by-william-j-mann.html

2012-10-08,T Fall Design 2012 | Editor’s Letter,"Who’s to say what perfect is? One person’s idea of perfection is another’s idea of too much — or not enough. For John Derian, whose decoupaged plates, lamps and paperweights evoke the past in a way that’s anything but nostalgic, renovating a former artist’s studio in the East Village for his new home meant leaving its uneven floors, cloudy windows and imperfect moldings intact, in an effort to preserve the patina of the 19th-century space. For Lynn Yaeger’s story, T followed the project over six months, photographing the renovation from start to finish. While Derian made significant changes to the interior, the envelope itself looked as if it had hardly been touched. Some might recoil at the apparent decrepitude of the space, but in Derian’s eyes — and ours — he was preserving its tattered poetry, allowing the ghosts of history a place at his often crowded dinner table. In a similar vein, the multilayered arrangements in the artist Nick Cave’s Chicago loft, as described by Linda Yablonsky, create a portrait of the artist as a human being who is emotionally connected to those who, like himself, live to make things.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/t-fall-design-2012-editors-letter/

This Saturday is mouthwatering, with huge tests of strength that could help determine who plays where come January. There will probably be routs from one end of the country to the other. Let’s break down the best games anyway, starting with two monster games from the Tyrannosaurus rex of conferences, the Southeastern.FINALLY, A CHALLENGE No. 5 Georgia has somehow managed to win 15 straight regular-season games without beating any team of notable strength. And it plays in the SEC. Something will give when the Bulldogs visit No. 6 South Carolina. With their leading receiver, Michael Bennett, injured, the Bulldogs will rely on the freshmen running backs Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, who are nicknamed Gurshall. The two combined for 294 yards and 5 touchdowns against Tennessee. South Carolina has a pretty fair back of its own in Marcus Lattimore, who has run for eight touchdowns. Both defenses are laden with Sunday-ready players, putting the onus on which team’s offensive linemen can avoid getting tossed around like bales of hay and open some holes for the runners behind them.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/college-football-matchups-3/

Since 1948, when the government started keeping such statistics, the country experienced a total of 82 months with an unemployment rate of more than 8 percent, and 43 of those months came under President Obama — more than the previous 11 administrations combined.

David Hockney’s touring exhibition “A Bigger Picture,” based on landscape paintings he did near his home in East Yorkshire, England, inspired Ms. Scott’s radiant palette, as well as leaf patterns. Colors have long been a Scott signature, and this season they are distinctively bold: deep aqua (for a dress with a heavy embroidered bodice), dark rose, fuchsia, turquoise (for a boyish leather jacket). Gold is sprinkled throughout the ultra-feminine collection (with a wink at Marlene Dietrich). There’s a solid gold-sequined coat, as well as a plaid halter-neck blouse with a matching gold cardigan. Ms. Scott, who lives part of the year in London, knows England well. In her fashion, she alludes to it with white summer tweeds, plaids, lace jabots, and somewhat tongue-in-cheek shoes done in two colors.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/lwren-scott-a-different-kind-of-comfort-food/

The size and lightness make it possible to rise into thin air, but those factors also make it vulnerable to wind at ground level. Art Thompson, the technical director of the Red Bull Stratos project, said there was no way to be sure of the balloon’s integrity once it was twisted by the wind.

Early in the next century, another establishment, the Widow Post’s, became “a favorite place for members of assembly.” Then there was Gallus Mag, “bouncer and general factotum” of a notorious Water Street dive mentioned in Herbert Asbury’s “Gangs of New York,” who “stalked fiercely about the dive with a pistol stuck in her belt.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/magazine/brooklyns-trailblazing-women-bartenders.html

He seems, as someone rightly points out, to have it backward. But as a professional dissembler, he knows better. Because much like the revolutionary shock troops who seized the United States embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, and turned the crisis into gripping political theater watched by the entire world — tune in tomorrow when America goes on trial, with the special guest star the Ayatollah Khomeini — the producer knows that historical events alone don’t cut it.

The twice-a-summer bareback horse race, Il Palio, is still the most anticipated event, and the contrade, or neighborhood associations, still inspire a loyalty as deep as they did in medieval times. At the same time the ancient university here continues to deliver important research while imbuing the town with a youthful spirit. Florence, Siena’s biggest rival to the north, may have won the battle in terms of historical significance and blockbuster art over the centuries, but Siena is decidedly less touristy and more livable.

Back then the Upper Peninsula was the site of a copper boom. By 1900, Calumet, the nearest city to Copper Harbor, had a 16,000-volume library and an elaborate opera house where Sarah Bernhardt performed, and eight foreign-language newspapers.

First, the Congos made one of my favorite records of the year, the trancelike “Icon Give Thank.” And second, because while watching “Icon Eye,” the documentary about the making of the album, there were several scenes starring Ital food, the predominantly vegetarian diet of the Rastafarian faith. One day, the Congos’ recording session was fueled by a shake made of cooked pumpkin, peanuts and oats and spiked with nutmeg.

And so my quest landed me in Diamond Plaza in the heart of Nairobi’s old Indian community, which sprouted roots here more than a century ago, dragged to Africa by the British to build a railroad.

2012-10-12,Pale Fire | Viola Di Grado,"Last year, when she was just 23, Viola Di Grado published her fearless first novel, “70% Acrylic, 30% Wool” (Europa Editions, $16), which became a best seller in her native Italy and was short listed for the country’s top literary prize, the Strega. This rapid rise was mostly attributed to her shimmering prose. (One Italian critic compared it to “Oriental porcelain.”) But Di Grado also stood out for her strange personal style. She wears black lipstick, a sorceress hood and fingerless lace gloves. Recently, she said, she strung naked baby dolls into a necklace. “Everyone is kind of suspicious,” she said in a telephone interview from Rome. “But I’ve always dressed like this. In Sicily, where I grew up, I was constantly insulted for it. But that only made me want to do it more.” Di Grado’s writing is similarly defiant. Her novel — available next month in an English translation by Michael Reynolds — is set in Leeds, England, a “purulent freckle” of a city where the sky is “the color of a raw chicken thigh.” The heroine, the 20-year-old Camelia, is losing her mind. She has her reasons: Camelia’s father was killed in a car accident, and her musician mother has turned into a helpless, self-destructive mute. Mother and daughter communicate only through an invented language of glances, one of several linguistic quirks in this novel: others have to do with Chinese ideograms and a sickening affliction called “verbal anorexia.” While she briefly finds comfort in friendship, or in sex, Camelia is eventually consumed by her madness, and Di Grado seems to mock the reader for imagining a happier ending. “Use it to mop the bathroom, that story of yours, or I don’t know, to line the hamster’s cage,” she writes. Your comfort does not interest her. “If someone reads the book before bed and then can fall asleep, I think I failed,” Di Grado explains. “Literature has to make you stop sleeping.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/pale-fire-viola-di-grado/

What was the true purpose of the clandestine organization known as V.F.D.? Why was everyone terrified of that question-mark-shaped shadow in the ocean? What was hidden in that MacGuffin of a sugar bowl everybody wanted? But in contrast to the frustratingly finite television series mentioned above, “Unfortunate Events” gave readers a glimmer of hope. Because the series’s pseudonymous author was also one of its characters — and he never went away.

The round house itself stands on reservation land, where tribal courts are in charge, but the suspect is white, and tribal courts can’t prosecute non-­Native people. Federal law would also seem to apply, but the rape may have taken place on a strip of land that is part of a state park, where North Dakota’s authority is in force, or on another that was sold by the tribe and is thus considered “fee land,” administered under a separate tangle of statutes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/books/review/the-round-house-by-louise-erdrich.html
2012-10-12,Nixon Protagonistes,"John Steinbeck was a constant champion of the downtrodden — and not just for the Dust Bowl refugees in “The Grapes of Wrath.” During the 1950s he took up the cause of a politician who was only slightly less of an underdog than the Joads: Adlai Stevenson, the Illinois egghead whose presidential bids have become synonymous with futility.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/books/review/nixon-protagonistes.html
2012-10-12,A Fictional Character,"Salman Rushdie’s memoir is many books in one book. It’s a personal story that takes place at the center of an international crisis: the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s 1989 denunciation of the author’s fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses,” as a work of blasphemy against Islam, and his call for Rushdie’s death. It’s a portrait of the artist as a young man that describes his influences, obsessions and ambitions as well as his rise in the publishing world. It’s a record of his relocation from Bombay to London to New York, where he settled in 2000. It’s an intimate tale of fathers and sons, of the beginnings and ends of marriages, of friendships and betrayals.

2012-10-12,Man of Majorca,"It’s somewhat intimidating to review a book already described by Thomas Mann as “one of the greatest” of the 20th century — or so its publisher claims. It also seems odd that, despite Mann’s blessing, Albert Vigoleis Thelen’s picaresque romp, “The Island of Second Sight,” only recently became available in English — published in Britain in 2010, 57 years after its first appearance in German. But welcome it is. Without presuming to echo Mann, this is one of the most unusual and entertaining books I have ever read.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/books/review/the-island-of-second-sight-by-albert-vigoleis-thelen.html

Chesterton wrote: “It was a tragic necessity that the Irish should remember it; but it was far more tragic that the English forgot it. For he who has forgotten his sin is repeating it incessantly forever.” If there is one event that best captures this tendency to forget, it is surely the Irish famine, which killed more than a million people in the middle of the 19th century. John Kelly underlines Chesterton’s point in a different way with the title of his new history, “The Graves Are Walking.” The Irish cannot help remembering.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/books/review/the-graves-are-walking-by-john-kelly.html

The review announced by Xinhua on Monday is to begin on Oct. 23; Mr. Bo was expelled from the party last month and is expected to stand trial on a wide range of criminal charges. Mr. Bo is a delegate to the congress, which gives him immunity from prosecution. A cancellation of his membership would pave the way for an indictment and a trial. Earlier, Wang Lijun, the former police chief of Chongqing and an associate of Mr. Bo, had his congress membership canceled before he was put on trial. Mr. Wang received a 15-year prison sentence in September for various crimes, including defection. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/world/asia/china-committee-may-strip-bo-of-immunity.html

The floor lamp stands 51 inches tall, the table lamp is 21 inches tall and the pendant length is customizable. They are priced from around $3,880 to $5,180 and are available through Lobmeyr.

2012-10-19,Bulls’ Offense Struggles Without Rose,"For the Chicago Bulls -– whose offense has struggled as the team has compiled a 2-2 record in the preseason -– the return of Derrick Rose from torn anterior cruciate ligament cannot come soon enough. In their four games, the Bulls are averaging a mere 87.5 points, nearly 9 points fewer than last season. They’re shooting only 38 percent from the field, including a woeful 21 percent from 3-point range. While some of this can be attributed to standard preseason sloppiness, it’s becoming clear -– particularly in a much-improved Eastern Conference -– that the prolonged recovery of Rose, the team’s All-Star point guard,  could spell trouble for Chicago’s overall success, even more so than did his more sporadic absences a season ago.

The professor, Park Kyung-sin of Korea University, was charged in February with violating the country’s online obscenity law. At the time, he was a commissioner of the Korea Communications Standards Commission, a government agency with an authority to delete Internet content it considered harmful. When the commission found the photos on a blog last year and discussed whether to remove them, Mr. Park, who was appointed by opposition lawmakers, suggested that they be allowed to stay on the blog, but perhaps with a warning rating. When the other commissioners, most of whom were appointed by President Lee Myung-bak and his governing party, overruled him and deleted the photos without giving their owner a chance to defend himself, Mr. Park posted the photos on his own blog, “Censor’s Diary,” and invited a debate of the commission’s decision. In the first court ruling in July, he was fined $2,700 for violating the obscenity law. But an appeals court on Thursday reversed the ruling, acquitting Mr. Park. The court said Mr. Park’s posting could not be ruled indecent because the photos should be viewed in the context of his attempt to criticize the government’s regulations on online content.

2012-10-19,1933 And All That,"Noah Smith continues the debate about recoveries after financial crises, and rightly dismisses John Taylor’s work; the serious contention is with Bordo-Haubrich (pdf).

In their postwar table (p. 26 of their paper), they identify 1973-5 and 1981-2 as “banking crisis” recessions, which seems just wrong; while there may have been banking troubles, both were very clearly “Fed recessions”, generated by sharp interest rate hikes intended to curb inflation.

They came to T’s attention via Gaby Basora, the fashion designer for Tucker, who hired Hayat-Camard to babysit her sons while in Paris for business.

That fascination with the postwar environment, which extended to homes too, was “about innovation and newness,” Nina Rappaport, an architectural critic, says.

I had never done a conventional historical novel or anything entirely from the point of view of women. Early on my wife would criticize me because my women characters were barely existent. I pointed out to her that the male characters were barely existent, too.

The Dutch chef, food stylist and illustrator is famous in her home country for “Home Made,” a cookbook in which she teaches readers how to make ice cream without a machine, smoked meat without a smoker, and cheese and dog biscuits from pantry staples. (Her dog, Marie, loves garlic.) At her restaurant in Amsterdam, Aan de Amstel, big enough to hold 36 diners, van Boven serves a menu of — you guessed it — local and largely organic food. The lineup of dishes revolves around seasonal produce, much of it picked at a garden nearby, and the wine list revolves around the dishes. “I would describe it as Mediterranean,” van Boven says of the menu, which at the moment features grilled lobster, Sardinian pasta, haddock with beets and fennel, fresh burrata and, for dessert, a house-made spicy coffee liqueur. “But it’s not just Italian or Spanish or French.

Judge Anne Molyneux told the protester, Trenton Oldfield, 36, that he had acted dangerously, and that his action had done nothing to redress the elitism he gave as his motive in court. “You did nothing to address inequality by giving yourself the right to spoil the enjoyment of others,” she said. An Olympic gold medalist in rowing, Matthew Pinsent, who was assistant umpire for the race, told the court that Mr. Oldfield could have been killed if he had been struck by an oar.

Instead of standard drum tones, he often uses a deep, edgeless thud or nothing at all, and he dwells on minor chords and misty open spaces.

The new mixtures protect against two different B strains, scientists from Sanofi Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals said at a medical meeting in San Diego. The B strains are rarer and usually arrive later in the season than the A strains, like A(H1N1), but they cause more hospitalizations and deaths. Until 1978, flu vaccines contained only one A and one B strain; a second A was added to fight A(H3N2), which had first emerged as the 1968 Hong Kong Flu. Two distinct B strains, known as Victoria and Yamagata, have existed since 2002, but it has been hard to predict a dominant one each year. The new quadrivalent vaccines, which are being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not approved for the public, are meant to lower that uncertainty.

Luciano Maiani, a physicist, resigned as president of the commission, along with several other members in protest over Monday’s ruling, in which the defendants have drawn six-year prison sentences. “The commission can’t carry out its functions in this situation, which borders on intimidation,” he said in an interview. “It’s impossible to work with serenity if you’re afraid that if you give an opinion that turns out not to be right you can be punished.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/world/europe/italy-officials-quit-over-quake-convictions.html

It adds an article to the criminal code that would criminalize the act of obtaining state secrets through means including deception, bribery, and coercion. People who obtain such information would face fines of $5,000 to $12,000 and prison sentences of up to eight years. The legislation needs approval from the upper house, where it is expected to pass.

2012-10-24,Our Secret Sauce,"It was striking how much Monday’s presidential debate on foreign policy came down to two subjects: America and the Middle East. The two actually provide some instructive contrasts, starting with one that I’ve noted since the onset of this campaign: the contrast between the high degree of American pluralism and trust that makes our country work, and the near total absence of it in the Middle East, the region most vexing us and most likely to blow up on the next president. Muslims are killing Muslims across the Middle East and Central Asia today: Sunnis versus Shiites, Pashtuns versus Pashtuns and Kurds versus Turks. Christians are not faring well there, either. The absence of pluralism and the prevalence of “rule or die” politics — either my sect or party is in power or I’m dead — is the dominant political trend in the Arab-Muslim region today. Nobody trusts anybody, but it is impossible to build a modern state or an innovation economy without trust. Meanwhile, here in America, we are debating whether to replace our first black president — whose middle name is Hussein and whose grandfather was a Muslim — with a Mormon! Who does that? Nobody else. That radical pluralism is the secret of our sauce, and blessedly so. America, take a bow.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/opinion/friedman-our-secret-sauce.html

The labyrinthine layout, pieced together from a former storage space, a dental clinic and a storefront, may have made the location a hard sell, but at 38,000 square feet, it is an interesting place to display artwork. For the first round of shows, Pivô enlisted two local galleries and an independent curator to present projects that largely respond to or intervene with the architecture of the site. “Pivô is dedicated to process and experimentation rather than to finished products,” Brenner says, “and to promoting a dialogue between contemporary art and its place in the city.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/art-in-residence/

Like George W. Bush in 2000, who famously (and probably foolishly) campaigned in California to lend himself an air of inevitability in the closing days of the campaign, Team Romney’s current brash confidence is designed to persuade the media to overlook the underlying numbers that still point to an advantage for the incumbent. And it’s working, Chait argues: The “widespread perception that Romney is pulling ahead,” he writes, “is Romney’s campaign suckering the press corps with a confidence game.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/obamas-aura-of-defeat/

Nothing exuded luxury or hinted at grace.” It was then that Dillon, who started Frends in Encinitas, Calif., with a group of fellow snowboarders in 2006, turned his focus to designing the “Taylor,” a cushy headset made of white lambskin and supersoft synthetic leather, finished with polished, gold-colored hardware. Named after the blues singer Koko Taylor, it is one of the brand’s three new women’s styles. (The other two get their names from music greats as well; the “Ella” earbuds go out to Ms. Fitzgerald, and the “Layla” set is for the Eric Clapton song.) All will be available at Apple stores starting on Oct. 30.

In recent years, Cambodia’s artistic community has slowly been rebuilding itself, and this coming spring some of the results will be on display in New York City at the Season of Cambodia festival. This gathering of more than 125 artists, performers and scholars will present Cambodian film, dance, visual art, shadow puppetry and more at venues all around the city, including the Guggenheim Museum, the Asia Society and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The celebration is being hosted by Cambodian Living Arts, a nonprofit group based in Phnom Penh that was founded in 1998 by Arn Chorn-Pond, who survived the mass killings as a child and eventually came to the United States. “When I first returned to Cambodia in the ’90s after the Paris peace accord, my friends and I were finding master teachers living on the streets — poor, weak, without food and basic health care,” said Mr. Chorn-Pond, whose work in rescuing these artists was detailed in the PBS documentary “The Flute Player.” The festival will run from April 6 through May 31, 2013.

The Dallas Morning News reported that the mediator, Tom Luce, resigned via an e-mail to Richard Tettamant, the administrator of the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System, the tower’s owner. “Recent events have made clear that the conditions and spirit under which I agreed to serve to help find a mutually beneficial solution for all parties are not being adhered to by you,” Mr. Luce wrote. “This saddens me, because I believe this is such an important issue for our city as a whole together with the financial future for our wonderful police and fireman. From the sideline I will be hoping this situation can be mutually resolved.” Mr. Luce, who did not return calls seeking comment, was apparently frustrated by what he saw as the pension fund’s violation of an embargo against the parties’ talking publicly about the negotiations.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/arts/design/mediator-resigns-in-dallas-tower-dispute.html

There was a semi-legitimate journalistic impulse behind it, but it was also billed as an act of mercy. I’d been traveling and writing a lot for them, spending a lot of time in middle seats on international flights, and my body had reached new levels of vileness.

He’ll serve a thrush with its decapitated head, or fire-roast a black grouse in hay, or slaughter a geriatric dairy cow and then dry-age it for nine months until, he writes, “the pure flavor of meat becomes secondary to the aromas of controlled decay . . . rather like a cheese.” “Faviken” (Phaidon, $50) is Nilsson’s first cookbook, and it’s the work of an obsessive: he spends an entire page explaining the proper way to peel a carrot. With ingredients like pickled marigolds and “turnip leaves that have never seen the light of day,” many of Nilsson’s recipes are hard to reproduce. Better to think of them as evocations of his Scandinavian Arcadia, where he picks wild flowers and shuttles around on skis, a rifle on his back “in case a tasty bird crosses my path.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/hunter-gatherer-magnus-nilsson/

The movie, directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted, is based on the true story of a Santa Cruz-area surfer, Rick Hesson, entertainingly nicknamed Frosty — welcome to California, people! — who back in the day helped shape a legend-to-be: Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), a boy with a dream and a battered board.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/movies/chasing-mavericks-by-curtis-hanson-and-michael-apted.html

It is not specifically addressed by the exhibition, which was organized by Kellie Jones, a Columbia University art historian, and had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the Californian extravaganza “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.” But I think it goes some way toward explaining why so few black artists have been embraced by the predominantly white high-end art world.

The idea of infants switched at birth, each growing up as somebody else, is an old and potent one in literature.

Baker sat in her fifth-floor office at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, staring at her computer screen. She had just completed a search for the word “sightseeing” in a federal database of U.S. aviation crashes between 2000 and 2010. Now she was scrolling through a seemingly endless list of grim case histories of people who were killed or injured when their sightseeing aircraft or balloon crashed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/magazine/safety-lessons-from-the-morgue.html
2012-10-26,Up Front,"Amanda Foreman is a historian who understands the power — and the appeal — of a well-turned phrase, an approach she often describes as “history in the round,” which she may have inherited, in part, from her father, the noted screenwriter Carl Foreman. Both her first book, “Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire,” and her account of Britain’s role in the American Civil War, “A World on Fire,” were critical and popular successes. It should be no surprise, then, that Foreman is also an avid reader of fiction, so avid that she was enlisted as a judge for this year’s Man Booker Prize.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/up-front.html
2012-10-26,New Faces of Evil,"From the spring of 1840 through the winter of 1841, Charles Dickens alternately horrified and captivated readers of his weekly magazine with the pitiful tale of Nell Trent in “The Old Curiosity Shop.” A large crowd was waiting at the pier when the ship carrying the final installment reached Lower Manhattan. According to Little Nell lore, as the surging mass heaved forward a voice cried out to the captain, “Does Little Nell die?” The answer “yes” yielded a hushed silence. The only contemporary author whose novels could lay claim to such international devotion and hysteria is J. K.

But spend enough time with them and you start wondering what’s “real,” anyway, and how many of your own experiences and desires are actually a sham.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/sorry-please-thank-you-by-charles-yu.html
2012-10-26,Captured on Film,"Edward Curtis deserves to be remembered as the American artist who racked up the most miles. Traveling by rail, wagon and foot, he undertook a project that struck observers as ambitious and possibly insane. His goal, he said, was to salvage a heritage from oblivion, to document all the tribes in North America that were still intact.The result was his magnum opus, “The North American Indian,” a 20-volume text-and-image extravaganza, published between 1907 and 1930, that was praised and then forgotten in short order. Curtis spent his final years holed up in Southern California, living a marginal hand-to-mouth existence and consuming a pound of carrots a day in the hope of warding off blindness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/short-nights-of-the-shadow-catcher-by-timothy-egan.html
2012-10-26,Untamed Island,"Civilization has always had its malcontents: detractors who despise the rat race and the corruption that inevitably accompanies human enterprise. These idealists long to return to a simpler, presumably purer life. In T. Coraghessan Boyle’s mesmerizing and elegiac 14th novel, “San Miguel,” two utopians from different eras — Will Waters, a veteran of the Civil War, and later, Herbie Lester, a World War I veteran suffering from shell shock — establish their own private idylls on the desolate Channel Islands off the California coast. Both men seek to escape the horrors of their wars, and both, in their egotism and maniacal drive, ignore the desires, needs and safety of the families they bring with them. But the star of the book is the island itself, San Miguel, in all its glorious barrenness, its guano-­coated cliffs and its pounding waves that cough up remnants of the frequent shipwrecks around the rocky shore. (A coffin shows up and is converted into a couch, then later is restored to its original purpose.) The inhabitants find the island pummeled by sandstorms and shrouded by fogs, only infrequently giving way to rare days when it is the paradise they sought.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/san-miguel-by-t-coraghessan-boyle.html

In the early days, things were clearer: you were a filthy, exsanguinated revenant, doomed to wander graveyards after dark, feeding on the blood of living humans (often children), sleeping in coffins, biting necks and hiding your face from sunlight, mirrors and God.

It’s not right to say that experimental fiction has been ghettoized — few ghettos are so elegantly art-directed — but its profile is as low as it is oddly shaped. The occasional experimental writer may get a small shimmer of publicity (David Markson, nice to have you aboard), but for the most part our weirdo formalists, our oddball language players, our “and this chapter you have to read upside down” acrobats are relegated to near invisibility.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/the-fifty-year-sword-by-mark-z-danielewski.html
2012-10-26,"Son, Brother, Husband","Grief can be a divisive force, especially within families. Sorrow can’t ­really be shared, as Joshua Henkin illustrates in his insightful third novel, “The World Without You.” The book opens a year after the death of Leo Frankel, a ­Daniel Pearl-like journalist killed on assignment in Iraq, as his family gathers at their summer home in the Berkshires for a memorial. On their first night together, his mother drops a bomb. “I’m leaving Daddy,” she announces at the dinner table. It’s a characteristically blunt declaration from Marilyn, a woman who has dedicated the past year to writing op-ed articles against the war, partly to ensure that Leo’s story remain in the public consciousness as it is always foremost in her own. Her husband, David, is no comfort, mostly because she doesn’t want to be comforted. She’s convinced that her grief is a cloud from which she will never emerge.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/the-world-without-you-by-joshua-henkin.html
2012-10-26,After the Gold Rush,"Neil Young is the kind of cantankerous, multitasking rocker Preston Sturges would have dreamed up, if Sturges had lived to see hippies descend on the Sunset Strip. There’s Young the sloppy musical perfectionist, the ebullient fatalist, the inscrutable dreamer, the misanthropic man of the people. There’s the earnest entrepreneur trying to launch a high-fidelity digital alternative to tinny-­sounding MP3s, the occasional movie director with roughly the aesthetic disposition of Bigfoot, the hobbyist so smitten with model trains he bought a piece of the Lionel company, a collector so crazy for cars he’s sunk a fortune into developing an eco-friendly hybrid version of a 1959 Lincoln Continental. He’s a devoted, profoundly protective family man and benefit-giving solid citizen who somehow smoked enough dope, snorted enough coke and drank enough spirits to keep pace with his generation’s most renowned substance abusers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/neil-youngs-waging-heavy-peace.html

2012-10-26,Rock Opera,"Except for Bob Dylan, no ’60s rock star is better qualified to write an autobiography than Pete Towns­hend. Most of the rock gods are or were plenty smart, but Townshend’s I.Q. has always seemed a thing apart, and his conceptual audacity as the music was forging an identity was surpassed only by the combined firepower of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. What’s more, he always had a special affinity for the written word. Friendly with many journalists, he turned out a column for the British music weekly Melody Maker in the early ’70s, and later that decade opened a bookstore and started a publishing company. To top that off, he began work as an editor at Faber & Faber just as he was launching his post-Who years in 1983.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/who-i-am-pete-townshends-memoir.html

Granted, this is true of a particular sort of person in any occupation — it’s hard, for example, to imagine Mitt Romney with iridescent orange dust all over his hands, unless he had accidentally purchased Halloween. But there is a kind of poet for whom involvement in the tackier, saltier elements of everyday life and popular culture seems not only unlikely, but almost inappropriate. Robinson Jeffers, for example, wrote lines like “I’d sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk” and praised “the massive / Mysticism of stone” and the “implacable arrogance” of birds of prey, while enjoying watching orcas maul sea lions because “there was nothing human involved . . . no lies, no smirk and no malice.” One struggles to envision him at a Bennigan’s happy hour.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/jack-gilberts-collected-poems.html
2012-10-26,What’s a Flesh Peddler to Do?,"The Italian writer Giorgio Faletti’s first thriller, “I Kill,” was a conventional serial-killer mystery, complete with a murderer who calls in clues to a local radio show and a detective who finds redemption from his tragic past by cracking the case. Apart from its length (more than 600 pages) and its setting (Monte Carlo), there was little to distinguish the book from dozens of similar noir exercises, but it sold millions of copies in Italy. Its English translation did not do as well as other recent European blockbusters, which surely explains why Faletti’s sixth novel, “A Pimp’s Notes,” is the first since “I Kill” to be available in the American market. It would seem a more likely bet for breakout success, being both a shorter and a more sophisticated effort, and it’s packed with all those ingredients — chiefly sexual violence and a plot gesturing vaguely at Europe’s troubled political history — that audiences here tend to look for in a foreign favorite.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/a-pimps-notes-by-giorgio-faletti.html

But since polls that establish an uptick in a candidate’s likability seem not merely to reflect, but also to promote, the strength of a candidacy, I am tempted to answer the polling question with an emphatic “no.” My question: Is it wrong to lie to a pollster if you believe that telling the truth will add momentum to a political candidate you oppose?

2012-10-26,Letters to the Editor,"To the Editor: Regarding “$150 for a Room in Manhattan? 7 That Fit the Bill, More or Less” (Oct. 21), the key to the low price for the Sheraton Tribeca was probably the fact that it was a Sunday night, not the author’s use of Priceline or Hotwire. I learned this trick a few years ago. High-quality chain hotels in Manhattan can offer rock-bottom rates for Sunday nights because that’s the night they’re most likely to have lots of unsold rooms. Think about it: business travelers stay Monday to Friday and weekend tourists stay Friday to Sunday, which leaves available inventory for Sunday nights. Last January I stayed at the Radisson Martinique at Herald Square for $119 on a Sunday night; two months before, I stayed in an identical room there for $379 on a weeknight. In June, my family and I stayed at a brand new, immaculate DoubleTree Suites property on 29th Street near Seventh Avenue on a Sunday evening and paid $107 (the rate was $119 with a further $12 reduction with my AAA or AARP card). We were walking distance from Herald Square, Times Square and the High Line.

Yovanovitch, who is known for chic, modern interiors, spent one year renovating the space, approaching it as he does all his projects — architecturally. “I always think about volumes before décor,” he says. His signature mix of sleek lines and light proportions with strong, tactile materials like oak, stone and steel and sinuous furnishings produce an effect that is spare but glamorous. “I don’t like a white box, like a gallery,” Yovanovitch says. “Minimal spaces don’t have to be stark.

2012-10-29,I’ll Take It! | A Garage Sale at MoMA,"For the first time, the Museum of Modern Art is holding a garage sale. Not that excess Picassos and Pollocks will be flying out the door — sorry! — but a hoard of other stuff will. From Nov. 17 to Nov. 30, the artist Martha Rosler will stock (and restock) the museum’s atrium with 12,000 donated objects, including neck chains, hankies and underwear, that she has gathered for her “Meta-Monumental Garage Sale,” possibly the largest ever — at least in an art space. (The image above is from a similar sale in London in 2005.) Rosler is widely known for her seminal Vietnam War-era collages, “House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home (1967-72),” which are on view elsewhere in the museum, and her sale doubles as a demonstration of the way society values received goods and ideas, and as a commentary on desire for ownership. That’s why she won’t reveal which six charities will receive the proceeds, only that she doesn’t plan to give MoMA — “the Kremlin of the value of art” — a single dime. “I don’t want people walking in there with a sense of virtue,” she says. Haggling, on the other hand, is welcome, and a hired wedding photographer will document the transactions, streamed live, Marina Abramovic style, on moma.org/garagesale under “Martha Rosler Made Me Buy.” “Maybe the garage sale is a metaphor for the mind,” Rosler says. “I find it very stressful.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/ill-take-it-a-garage-sale-at-moma/

2012-10-29,A Venus Ascends Into the Night,"There was always a troubling question about “Venus in Fur.” When New York critics fell all over themselves praising the play’s 2010 Off Broadway production and became equally excited when it moved to Broadway last season, the lion’s share (and by that, we do mean all) of the talk seemed to be about its star, Nina Arianda. Ms. Arianda, an unknown before this role, ended up winning a Tony Award for it, beating out even Tracie Bennett’s praised-to-the-rafters portrayal of a late-career Judy Garland in “End of the Rainbow.” So a nagging concern sat there. Was it the actress, and not the play, that impressed us so much? Hartford TheaterWorks’ frisky new production clears things up. “Venus in Fur” is an entertaining, worthwhile play on its own. Without Ms. Arianda — who in her 20s is being compared to Meryl Streep — it is not quite as intoxicating or as magical. But with the deceptively button-cute Liv Rooth, who was Ms. Arianda’s Broadway understudy in both this play and “Born Yesterday,” it is perhaps a bit sharper and clearer. And this intimate Hartford theater is an ideal setting for a show about two people in a rehearsal studio on a dark and stormy night.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/nyregion/a-review-of-venus-in-fur-at-theaterworks-hartford.html

2012-10-29,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE ESSENTIALS: MIND GAMES Robert Osborne and Drew Barrymore explain why “Diabolique” (1955), Henri-Georges Clouzot’s thriller about the cruel headmaster of a boarding school (Paul Meurisse) whose wife (Véra Clouzot, above left with Simone Signoret) and mistress (Signoret) plot to kill him, is required viewing. The women drug him, then drown him in a bathtub and dump the body in a pool. But when the pool is drained, the body is gone. It is easy to see why the film’s distributors “are earnestly asking audiences not to reveal how it ends,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. “And it isn’t only in the last reel that the surprises and the excitement are in evidence. The morbid fascination starts building before the picture is 10 minutes gone. By the time it is rolling toward a climax it is spreading the most delicious chills. It is a pip of a murder thriller, ghost story and character play rolled into one.” The evening continues with “Games” (1967), at 10, starring Signoret as an aging cosmetics saleswoman and amateur medium who joins two Manhattan socialites (James Caan and Katharine Ross) in a series of novel pastimes, this one involving the seduction of an adolescent delivery boy (Don Stroud). And in “What’s the Matter With Helen?” (1971), at midnight, two mothers (Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters) move to Hollywood to start a talent school after their sons are convicted of murder.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Mr. Greenberg, a Forbes writer, interviewed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange three weeks before he leaked 250,000 State Department files, the largest release of classified materials in history. In that interview, Mr. Assange alluded to another leak — this time involving a major bank — that he likened to the Enron e-mails. Speculation that Assange was referring to Bank of America shaved $3.5 billion off the bank’s market capitalization. But that release never happened. Mr. Greenberg said he wrote the book, in part, to find out why. He traveled to cypherpunk hangouts all over the country and then the world — Iceland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Berlin — to meet Julian Assange’s predecessors and those who seek to build the next WikiLeaks.

Last week, Richard Mourdock, the Tea Party-backed Republican Senate candidate in Indiana, declared during a debate that he was against abortion even in the event of rape because after much thought he “came to realize that life is that gift from God. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.” That came on the heels of the Tea Party-backed Republican Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois saying after a recent debate that he opposed abortion even in cases where the life of the mother is in danger, because “with modern technology and science, you can’t find one instance” in which a woman would not survive without an abortion. “Health of the mother has become a tool for abortions anytime, for any reason,” Walsh said. That came in the wake of the Senate hopeful in Missouri, Representative Todd Akin, remarking that pregnancy as a result of “legitimate rape” is rare because “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/friedman-why-i-am-pro-life.html

2012-10-29,What’s On Sunday,"5 P.M. (BBC America) THE SECRET OF CRICKLEY HALL Based on the novel by James Herbert, this thriller begins a year after the disappearance of Cam, the son of Gabe Caleigh (Tom Ellis) and his wife, Eve (Suranne Jones, above), who are trying to start life anew with their two daughters in a seemingly perfect country house. But when cellar doors start to open on their own, the wailing of children echoes in the night and a cane-wielding specter makes its presence known, the family realizes the house isn’t so idyllic after all. Just as they are about to move out, Eve hears Cam’s cries, and a desperate race to find the connection between him and the house ensues. This three-hour presentation “delivers exactly what the phrase ‘British mini-series’ promises for the American viewer: an old-fashioned story, ever so slightly dull but directed with a polish and restraint we’re not used to and with convincing performances from top to bottom,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “The story moves on parallel tracks 60 years apart — the haunted house and how it got that way — and while the devices are familiar (whining dogs, self-opening doors) and the plot twists unsurprising, the whole enterprise is so sufficiently literate and well acted that it’s easy to hang around to find out who’s dead, who’s alive and who will remain so. Among the weekend’s treats, ‘Crickley Hall’ is the one you wouldn’t want to trade with your brother when you got home.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

It was the job of the president, Obama said, to “tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism,” and it was on this score that he had fallen short. Conservatives gleefully mocked the president, saying that the country needed jobs more than it needed stories, and the remark did seem to hint at some genuine denial. After 40-plus months of high unemployment, a president who thinks his mistakes rest not in his policy choices but rather in his ability to articulate them is probably telling himself a story, if no one else.

Brittain has designed more than 20 versions of this crystalline pendant (that’s Shy 088 hanging over her head), each one of which can be hung from any point in its frame. What is more, “there are still many things in my brain I want to exploit with it,” says Brittain, who set up her studio last year. Brittain herself is something of a shape shifter. She briefly studied product design but went on to get degrees in philosophy and architecture. For three years she worked as the design director for the lighting designer Lindsey Adelman, all the while making braided leather jewelry, hilariously monstrous bug sculptures and crystal-dusted rope “waterfalls” in her spare time. This fall, Brittain will introduce two new faceted fixtures, and a pyrite-inspired pendant that she designed for the rapid-prototyping company .MGX will make its debut next spring at the Milan design fair. Still, she is not quite ready to settle into the title of lighting designer. “I’d like to explore the possibility of bringing the materiality and femininity of my other projects into my design work,” she says, adding, as if to remind herself, “You can only do so many things at once.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/seeing-the-light-2/
