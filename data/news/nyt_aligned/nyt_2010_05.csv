2010-05-03,Now Showing | Karl Haendel at Lever House,"Karl Haendel’s breezy, virtuosic powers with a pencil have produced 34 large-scale works on paper that confront the limitations of drawing as a medium. The installation — a commission for Lever House — pits paper and pencil against the soaring, glass curtain wall of Gordon Bunshaft’s modernist icon. But if it’s a David and Goliath matchup, then Haendel comes out on top. After all, a modernist glass tower has, relative to its size, a thin skin and these drawings seem to take direct aim at that vulnerability. Cracks — both literal and figurative — are the leitmotif: smashed glass, shattered light bulbs, arresting images of broken eggs, snaking power cables and a gigantic fingerprint fractured into dash marks. Haendel takes pleasure in toying with the conventions of display — the drawings are hung on two specially built and intentionally unfinished walls — and his use of tacks and staples is a delightful affront to the works’ inherent fragility. Frank, handwritten comments on the walls and on annotated lists of absurd phrases and book titles bring the age of anxiety into focus.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/now-showing-karl-haendel-at-lever-house/

It’s called Wave Organ, and it is one of those phenomena that could only exist in northern California. Originally created in 1986 by the environmental artists Peter Richards and George Gonzales and newly restored, Wave Organ, which is part of the Exploratorium, is a 10-minute walk toward the Marina and out onto a jetty. Approaching the white and gray stone multi-layered structure I felt like I had been transported to a Greek island if not for the amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I stepped out on to the granite and marble stones (which I later learned were donated to the project from an old Gold Rush era cemetery that was demolished to make way for a housing development), tilted my ear onto one of the numerous PVC pipes sticking out of the floor, and began to hear poetically eerie sounds. Each pipe makes a different sound depending on the tide. I then sat in a 3-sided room, listening to the music bounce off of the walls while seagulls dipped in an out of view. It was peaceful and calming and by the time I left, I felt as if I had been on holiday.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/anne-on-the-move-wave-organ/

The film, which also starred Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette and Alan Arkin, centered on a precocious young performer (Ms. Breslin) and her eccentric family’s do-or-die efforts to get her into a beauty pageant. It was a breakout hit at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and went on to earn more than $100 million at the box office worldwide.

The film, which also starred Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette and Alan Arkin, centered on a precocious young performer (Ms. Breslin) and her eccentric family’s do-or-die efforts to get her into a beauty pageant.

The proposal, known as the Tranquillon Ridge project, would have been the state’s first new oil lease in 40 years, bringing new wells to waters off Santa Barbara. Without the drilling project, state parks will need another source for $100 million this year. On Monday, the governor also vetoed a bill that would have banned smoking at all state parks and beaches.

In Paris, nail salons are few and far between, and when you do find one, Madam must make an appointment! Walk-ins are unheard of. And forget having your cuticles cut. It is simply not done! But if you know where to look, the French are extremely good at lavishing you with care. And that’s where “Pampered in Paris: A Guide to the Best Spas, Salons and Beauty Books” (The Little Bookroom, New York; available May 11 for $16.95 at littlebookroom.com) comes in. The author, Kim Horton Levesque, has scoured the boulevards and the back alleys. She’s soaked in hammams and had had her corns and calluses attended by a Chinese chiropodist. She’s been lathered and creamed, exfoliated and scrubbed to an inch of her life. This, so you can enjoy chocolate facials and bask in some of the most wonderfully designed spas on earth. F.Y.I.: body massage in France usually includes a chest massage. Madam may not like that.

2010-05-04,The Man Who Saved American Catholicism,"His name is David Spotanski, and in the early 2000s he was the chancellor of the diocese of Belleville, in Illinois, where Wilton Gregory was bishop. Gregory was elected president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in the autumn of 2001, just as the wave of sex abuse revelations began breaking over the American church. Four months later, Spotanski wrote his bishop a 10-page memo on the abuse crisis, which he read aloud to Gregory in the bishop’s private study. In part, the memo was a blistering attack on the American hierarchy, from Boston’s Bernard Law on down, for their dreadful negligence, cover-ups and excuse-making. In part, it was a blueprint for action: To have any chance of restoring their credibility, Spotanski wrote, the American bishops needed to invite victims from decades past to come forward and act swiftly on their claims, adopt strict nationwide standards for handling new allegations of sex abuse, and then turn over as much responsibility as possible for implementing the rules to an independent board of laypeople (and parents), who could issue annual reports and hold recalcitrant bishops’ feet to the fire.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/the-man-who-saved-american-catholicism/

For an example of what I did have in mind, though, read Kevin Williamson’s fine piece on supply-side economics from the last National Review, in which he goes after the panglossian misinterpretation of supply-side theory that’s become dogma among too many Republican politicians and activists — namely, that tax cuts generate so much economic growth (and with it, increased government revenue) that they more than pay for themselves. As Williamson notes, the most prominent supply-side theorists themselves don’t believe this, but they’re tolerant of politicians who do:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/myths-of-the-supply-side/

The Department issued a stop-work order and an Environment Control Board violation this weekend to Elizabeth Houston Associates, the owner of a building on Houston Street near the Bowery on which Mr. Fairey recently installed a mural connected with his show at Deitch Projects in Soho. The mural was pasted onto a structure built on top of the original wall, preserving another mural by the Brazilian brothers known as Os Gemeos. According to Ryan Fitzgibbon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, the violation was issued for installing the structure and the mural without a permit. She said the Environmental Control Board court would hold a hearing soon on the violation; if it stands, it could carry a penalty of up to $25,000. She added that the Department was also considering issuing a violation for illegal advertising on the grounds that the mural constituted an advertisement for the Deitch Projects show. But Daniel Killinger, a managing director of Goldman Properties, an affiliate of Elizabeth Houston Associates, said that Goldman did not see the mural as an advertisement. “We see it as a continuation of the history of the art that’s always been on that site,” he said, referring to the Os Gemeos mural and a previous mural designed by Keith Haring.

It will begin with “Bells Are Ringing,” the musical by Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, which will run from Nov. 18 through 21. Judy Holliday starred in the original 1956 Broadway production, about a phone-answering service employee who gets involved in the lives of her clients.

It was first presented on Broadway in 1949 and briefly revived in 1972; this version will run at City Center from Feb. 3 to Feb. 6, 2011. Finally, Encores! will present “Where’s Charley?”, the farcical George Abbott musical adapted from the Brandon Thomas comedy “Charley’s Aunt,” from March 17 to 20, 2011.

The Broadway production of the play, which opened last week after transferring from London’s West End, collapsed almost as rapidly as its namesake: though its cast included Norbert Leo Butz (“Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,” “Speed-the-Plow”) and Gregory Itzin (“24”) as the Enron executives Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay, as well as Marin Mazzie (“Kiss Me, Kate”) as a composite Enron employee, it was shut out of most major categories. Stephen Kunken was nominated as a featured actor in a play, but its lack of a nomination for best play likely sealed its fate. “Enron” could still be the rare play to win the Tony for best original score, another category in which it is also nominated.

The tanker had been on its way to China with a cargo of crude oil worth an estimated $52 million. Its seizure seemed a setback for the European force, which has recently been claiming successes for a new strategy of intercepting pirate vessels far out at sea before they attack shipping lines. Reuters quoted a pirate identified only as Abdi as warning against any rescue attempt as the tanker sailed toward the Somali coast, saying it would endanger the crew.

The state-run Xinhua news agency, which reported the development on Wednesday, quoted the minister of the State Council Information Office, Wang Chen, as saying that the government was also considering real-name registration for cellphone users and a new law governing “Internet security.” Mr. Wang said new restrictions were needed to curb the online spread of “harmful information” and infiltration of the Internet by “hostile overseas forces.” Critics say the increasing crackdown on use of the Internet is a crucial element of the government’s effort to silence domestic political dissent.

In recent months, Chinese leaders have stressed the need to quickly develop the economies of Xinjiang and Tibet, huge areas of western China where ethnic minority groups have rebelled against Chinese rule. Last July, at least 197 people were killed and 1,700 injured in ethnic rioting in Xinjiang. Under the aid program, relatively wealthy provinces or cities in other parts of China would send money to designated counterparts in Xinjiang. The report said 82 cities or towns in Xinjiang would benefit. The government has been running a similar program in the region for 13 years, but is greatly expanding it now, the report said.

In an announcement on the festival’s Web site the organizers wrote that they had chosen Mr. Tarantino, whose films include “Pulp Fiction” and “Inglourious Basterds,” because “he has become a studied and imitated ‘point of reference,’ and he is perhaps the only American auteur to be adored worldwide like a rock star.” The announcement also praised Mr. Tarantino for rediscovering “overlooked actors in impressive roles,” and for his own work as “an atypical character actor” in films like Takashi Miike’s “Sukiyaki Western Django” (a 2008 Venice festival entry in which he played a mysterious gunfighter named Ringo). Not least of all, the festival organizers also noted Mr. Tarantino is “a great admirer and connoisseur of Italian genre cinema.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/thats-a-bingo-quentin-tarantino-to-head-venice-film-festival-jury/

2010-05-06,Now Showing | Swid/Kaufman,"In their own ways, Nan Swid and Donald Kaufman have always been enablers. A founder of the design company Swid Powell, Swid worked with an A-list of artists and architects like Frank Gehry, Richard Meier and Ettore Sottsass to produce all manner of tabletop objects. The company archives — from a coffee maker to candlesticks — now reside at the Yale University Museum of Art. Kaufman — who with his wife and business partner, Taffy Dahl, founded Donald Kaufman Color in the ‘70s — has long been the go-to guy for architects and decorators looking for that elusive shade of not-quite-gray-not-quite-white or flaming red. Take a tour of Philip Johnson’s Glass House or grab a drink at the Julian Schnabel-designed Gramercy Park Hotel and you get the picture. But for four days this week, instead of making other people look good, Swid and Kaufman will bask in the spotlight as artists in their own right, when they show their personal work at Gallery 9E in Chelsea. Unsurprisingly, Kaufman — whose work has been in museums like the Whitney and the Hirshhorn, but who hasn’t had an exhibition in over 30 years — is a painter. His series of gouaches on paper, he says, are inspired by architectural color samples. And true to form, Swid is more object-oriented, layering pieces of old books, cellophane, legal files and other found materials into three-dimensional reliefs.

But no more: Ms. Perkins, who was nominated for three Emmy Awards in her five seasons on “Weeds,” is leaving the series, The Hollywood Reporter said. She will instead take a role in a hybrid live-action and animated film called “I Hop,” directed by Tim Hill (“Alvin and the Chipmunks”), in which she will play the mother of a young man (James Marsden) who is forced to take care of the son of the Easter bunny (whose voice will be provided by Russell Brand).

After the fall of 2008 “we were losing money hand over fist,” he said. A $350,000 sponsorship deal with “a major financial institution” fell through at the last minute, in late March, and new investors could not be found quickly enough. “We had cash flow for about four weeks, and four weeks was just not enough for us to bridge that gap with the debt that we were already carrying,” Mr. Gerard said.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/movies/07arts-GENARTFOLDSV_BRF.html

The case has put an unwelcome spotlight on Israel, whose intelligence service, the Mossad, is widely believed to have ordered the killing.

The suspects can be seen on the videotape disguising themselves as tourists, and following the Hamas operative, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, to his hotel room. Some of the killers used more than one alias, including one man believed to be Zev Barkan, an Israeli being sought by New Zealand authorities in a 2004 passport fraud case, the person familiar with the investigation said.

Ms. Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president, apparently does not hold a grudge against Ms. Fiorina for saying during that campaign that Ms. Palin could not run a major company. Ms. Palin, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, shared her choice on her Facebook page. The endorsement disappointed conservative DeVore supporters. On Thursday night, the three Republican candidates — Ms. Fiorina, former Congressman Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore — clashed over immigration, gun control and the rights of terrorism suspects in their only debate before the June primary. They are hoping to unseat Senator Barbara Boxer in November.

Rittenband intended to use Mr. Polanski’s time in prison for psychiatric evaluation as his punishment in the case. In their brief on Thursday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley and Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said that the testimony should remain sealed and noted that the authorities in Switzerland, where Mr. Polanski is being held pending possible extradition, have not requested transcripts of the sealed testimony.

First, as The Telegraph puts it this morning, no matter what kind of government gets formed in the next few days, “the only certainty is another general election,” and sooner rather than later. And second, as The Economist’s Buttonwood suggests, the next election will probably be precipitated by resistance — from regional parties and the Liberal Democrats as well as Labour — to the hard budgetary choices a Prime Minister Cameron will be forced to make. Cameron campaigned as a change agent this time, but if he finds himself facing the voters again in a year or so, it will be as the face of fiscal austerity — which is a role that no politician wants to inhabit.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/the-battle-of-britain/

Her subtitle, “How Eight Cooks Saved My Life,” is manifested partly in mini-profiles of Marion Cunningham, Alice Waters, Ruth Reichl, Marcella Hazan, Rachael Ray, Edna Lewis, Leah Chase and her own mother, Anne Marie Zappa Severson, but more in accounts of her dealings with these women.

Spies had read about “A Tool to Deceive and Slaughter,” as the piece is called, on a Reuters financial blog. That’s a strange-enough place for a collector to learn about art, but Spies’s interest seems even more curious given that the blogger Felix Salmon’s write-up of the piece’s sale was titled “The Uncollectible Artwork.” Even if Spies won the object, created by a young artist named Caleb Larsen, his ownership would be tentative: the technical innards of “A Tool to Deceive and Slaughter” carried a program that would relist the thing on eBay every week, forever. Indeed, the terms and conditions for submitting a bid clearly stipulated that the device must be connected to the Internet, constantly trying to resell itself at a higher price to someone else.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09FOB-Consumed-t.html
2010-05-07,The Plural of E-Mail,"Ashley Mergen asks: ""What is the proper plural of e-mail? When referring to snail mail, you would not say, 'I received a hundred mails,' but rather, 'I received a hundred pieces of mail' or 'I received a hundred mailings.' However, when referring to e-mail, one would say, 'I received a hundred e-mails.' Correct?""  The plural form of e-mail is, indeed, e-mails, even though there's no corresponding plural of mail as mails. This mismatch has rankled seekers of grammatical consistency over the years, but it has nonetheless settled into standard usage.  First some terminology. Nouns that can form plurals are called ""count nouns."" Mail, historically, is what is known as a ""mass noun"" — a noun that can't be enumerated and thus resists pluralization, much like mud and milk, patience and poppycock. Some nouns can be either count or mass, depending on the context. General Sherman used war as a mass noun when he said, ""War is hell,"" while Benjamin Franklin used it as a count noun when he said, ""All wars are follies, very expensive and very mischievous ones.""  Many mass nouns have spawned countable spinoffs over time. Coffee is usually an undifferentiated mass (""Get me some coffee""), but in modern use it can also be treated as a count noun denoting a cupful of the beverage (""Get me a coffee"") or a variety of the bean (""We serve the finest Arabica coffees""). The Stanford linguist Arnold Zwicky has dubbed this process ""countification.""  When the word e-mail first made its appearance in the early 1980s (often capitalized as E-mail), it was simply a shortening of electronic mail, and so it worked grammatically much like the mass noun mail. To itemize mail into its constituent parts you need to find a workaround like pieces of mail or letters. Similarly, individual pieces of e-mail came to be called e-mail notes or more commonly, e-mail messages. (Single terms like e-notes or e-letters never caught on.)  By the late '80s, e-mail message was slowly but surely shortened to e-mail. In the archives of the magazine InfoWorld, the earliest use of e-mail as a count noun that I can find is from July 20, 1987, in an advertisement for International Data Group (IDG). ""Jane Lawrence, editor of IDG's PC Business World, receives an E-mail from [Ann] Wujcik requesting information,"" the ad reads. Though the magazine generally preferred e-mail message, by 1992 even InfoWorld's publisher Robert Metcalfe was using the short form: ""I have to admit I am now getting so many E-mails I can only read all and answer a few of them.""  The countable kind of e-mail(s) made further headway over the course of the '90s, despite complaints that it strayed from the founding model of mail, and by the turn of the millennium it had become widely accepted in mainstream usage. (The mass-noun version never went away, of course.) What happened? My theory is that the e- prefix no longer felt like such a transparent abbreviation of electronic, allowing e-mail to cast off the bonds that kept it close to mail of the snail variety. The word's new unitary feel was further strengthened by the trend of spelling it as email, without the hyphen. (The New York Times style guide continues to stick by hyphenated e-mail, and even advises using the older, longer form of the noun, e-mail message.)  The countification of e-mail mirrors some other recent developments in tech-talk. Unwanted e-mail, known as spam, is usually treated as a mass noun (just like the canned meat after which it is named), but individual spam messages now often get called spams. And the word blog, while always countable, has taken a new semantic turn: some use it to mean a single post to a Web site, rather than a whole site consisting of such posts. A recent survey by the Copyediting newsletter finds that most writers and editors reject this usage of blog as improper, but who knows? In a decade's time, it could be as unremarkable as countable e-mails.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09FOB-onlanguage-t.html
2010-05-07,The Demise of Datebooks,"I miss my Filofax datebook, with its six rings and dark red leather binder. I had a green one first, with a calendar that cast each week across two cream-colored pages. Back then, at age 30, I was not busy enough to need a whole page per day, which some Filofax calendars provide, but far too busy, or so I liked to imagine, to fit a week’s activities on a single page. I left that green one in a taxi and replaced it with a red one. Old reddie is still around, with my life during half of 2007 memorialized. Even when I started half-heartedly to use iCal, Apple’s personal-calendar program for the Mac, I lugged around the Filofax in case I needed — I don’t know — the address book?

According to the chart that Dr. Roxanne Wadia had glanced through, the patient was five months pregnant. But her arms and legs were thin and wasted-looking, and she had only a tiny hint of the expected baby bump. Her eyes were sunken, and her skin was sallow. Looking at her new patient, Wadia, a resident in her second year of training at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, felt her own heart quicken. The patient was clearly sick.

It is difficult, in the middle of any momentous historical event, to discern its true nature. Is this a revolution or a craze? Will the new 3-D, like sound in the late 1920s and ’30s, color and widescreen a generation later, or computer-generated imagery over the past decade, fundamentally alter the way movies are made and experienced? Or will it be more like the old 3-D: an intriguing but ultimately limited gimmick? ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/movies/09scott.html

On a Time Warner Cable system channel guide, the film was described as being about a young woman preparing “to carry out her mission as a suicide bomber in New York’s Times Square.” It had been scheduled to appear on Sundance a couple of additional times this month.

On the other you have the monstrously successful “American Idol,” whose ratings have seen worrisome declines this year amid complaints about a ho-hum lineup of contestants. Put the two phenomena together, as happened on Wednesday night, and you should have a high-wattage hit. But instead, the pairing just made the week worse for both parties. Hours after Lady Gaga appeared on the show to perform her songs “Bad Romance” and “Alejandro,” she was on Twitter complaining about how she was presented on the show. “FOX POORLY + AMATEURLY edited+cut my performance/musical arrangement on idol,” Lady Gaga wrote. She also provided a link to the Web site PerezHilton.com, where she said the full unedited performance could be found. Even in its shortened form, Lady Gaga’s performance was not much help to “American Idol,” which posted its worst Wednesday-night ratings since 2002.

The question now is whether both Mr. Douglas, 67, and the 12-member commission can weather the state’s next budget and continue enforcing the 1976 Coastal Act. Mr. Douglas said he was deeply concerned that an item in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposed budget could limit the agency’s access to state legal services. The commission, based in San Francisco, is one of the nation’s most powerful — and litigious — land-use authorities.When Is a Bay Not a Bay? | A major development proposed in Redwood City is, depending on whom you ask, either on the shore of San Francisco Bay — or actually in the bay itself.

The 74-year-old Ms. Andrews — whose voice was damaged in 1997 by surgery to remove throat polyps — mostly spoke during the performance, singing occasionally when accompanied by other vocalists and, in one case, the enthusiastic audience. She opened with “Getting to Know You,” from “The King and I,” and faded into the background as five other singers took over. That song began a tribute to Rodgers and Hammerstein, throughout which Ms. Andrews told stories about her work on stage and screen while video clips of her performances were shown above the stage. Though it was obvious that Ms. Andrews would not be hitting the high notes that helped define her career, she reassured her fans that she could “still sing the hell out of ‘Ol’ Man River.’ ” The audience, in turn, cheered for her rendition of “My Funny Valentine,” her one solo of the evening, and participated in a boisterous “Do-Re-Mi” singalong. During the second half of the show, Ms. Andrews narrated “Simeon’s Gift,” a children’s book she wrote with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, while the supporting cast played the book’s characters. And a finale of classics from “South Pacific” and “The Sound of Music” drew the last of the night’s many standing ovations.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/arts/music/10arts-THESOUNDOFJU_BRF.html

On Saturday, after more than 70 years in show business, six Emmy Awards and one improbable Facebook campaign, Betty White, left, got her shot at hosting “Saturday Night Live.” With her, the show had its highest ratings in a year and a half, according to preliminary Nielsen figures provided by NBC. Despite Ms. White’s opening monologue, which made distinctions between her generation and that of the “SNL” fans who pushed for her to host, she seemed at home on the show. She appeared in every sketch, playing, among others, an inadvertently naughty muffin mogul and a loopy census interviewee. The Mother’s Day-themed episode, which brought back the past cast members Molly Shannon, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch and Ana Gasteyer, was also a rare occasion on which the mostly male “SNL” cast took a back seat to its women: Ms. Shannon and Ms. Gasteyer appeared in their NPR parody, “Delicious Dish”; Ms. Rudolph made a return appearance as Whitney Houston; and Ms. Poehler was temporarily reseated at the “Weekend Update” desk. The musical guest was Jay-Z. Support for Ms. White, who became host of the show after a Facebook campaign, was evident on Twitter, where she was a trending topic on Sunday and had praise from fans including the teenage singer Justin Bieber, who tweeted after the broadcast, “BETTY WHITE RULES.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/arts/television/10arts-BETTYWHITEHE_BRF.html

In the original Newsweek article, published online in April, Ramin Setoodeh, a Newsweek contributor, wrote: “While it’s OK for straight actors to play gay (as Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger did in ‘Brokeback Mountain’), it’s rare for someone to pull off the trick in reverse.” Of Mr. Hayes’s performance in “Promises, Promises,” Mr. Setoodeh wrote: “Frankly, it’s weird seeing Hayes play straight. He comes off as wooden and insincere, like he’s trying to hide something, which of course he is.” In her response, published on Newsweek.com, Ms. Chenoweth wrote: “This article offends me because I am a human being, a woman and a Christian. For example, there was a time when Jewish actors had to change their names because anti-Semites thought no Jew could convincingly play Gentile.” She added: “Audiences aren’t giving a darn about who a person is sleeping with or his personal life. Give me a break! We’re actors first, whether we’re playing prostitutes, baseball players, or the Lion King.” About her co-star, Ms. Chenoweth said, “I’d put Hayes and his brilliance up there with some of the greatest actors period.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/theater/11arts-KRISTINCHENO_BRF.html

Lawyers for Mr. Polanski had hoped to use the testimony, by a retired prosecutor, Roger Gunson, to fight his extradition by authorities in Switzerland. Mr. Gunson’s conditional testimony was taken earlier this year, so that it could be used if he were not available to testify in a sentencing hearing, should Mr. Polanski be returned to the United States. In denying the request, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza said of the Swiss: “I’m satisfied that they have information that they need.” Mr. Polanski fled the United States in 1978, on the eve of his sentencing for having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. His lawyers have argued that Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who is now deceased, improperly used Mr. Polanski’s psychiatric evaluation in a California prison as his punishment, and that Mr. Gunson’s testimony, if provided to the Swiss, would show that Mr. Polanski does not qualify for extradition under a treaty between Switzerland and the United States.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/judge-denies-polanksi-request-to-unseal-testimony/

Now, drivers can work overtime – earning time-and-a-half pay – even if they have not worked 40 hours in a week. That rule creates a financial incentive for drivers to skip work on regular workdays and to work overtime on other days, the audit found.

2010-05-12,Latin Flair,"Ten years ago, Alex Atala’s D.O.M. broke the tradition in São Paulo of culinary colonialism — French, Italian and Japanese were good; Brazilian was bad. Now, after so many bowls of feijoada, a young class of chefs is mixing cuisines and techniques and taking Brazilian cooking to a higher level. Checho Gonzáles, 44, the heavily tattooed chef at the year-old restaurant Ají (Rua Bela Cintra, 1709; 011-55-11-3083-4022; entrees $17 to $27), fuses the flavors of his native Bolivia with the classics of Brazilian cooking. (Each of his knuckles is inked with the image of a popular local bar snack.) The meat stew cozido, for example, is made with tender chunks of picanha braised in red wine, and the caipirinhas are flecked with bright red ají peppers from the mountains of his homeland. At Marakuthai, tucked away in a house in Jardins (above; Alameda Itu, 1618; 011-55-11-3062-7556; entrees $20 to $29), the 21-year-old Renata Vanzetto takes inspiration from Thai food for her cooking, which is based on fresh local fruit and produce, for dishes like shrimp in curry sauce with coconut-crusted banana. And at Kaá (Avenida Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek, 279; 011-55-11-3045-0043; entrees$22 to $37), a high-design Jardins hot spot, Paulo Barros uses Amazonian ingredients like star fruit and bacuri to localize his French-Italian menu. ‘‘Brazil is now being looked to as a global economic player,’’ says Barros, 37. ‘‘So why not bring its power into the kitchen, too?’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/latin-flair/

2010-05-12,Q & A: Joerg Koch,"After reading the summer issue of 032c  (which I wrote about in an earlier post), featuring William T. Vollmann and photographs by Danko Steiner, I rooted out my few copies of Nest. I hadn’t thought about them in a while and wasn’t surprised that their look and sense of freedom continued to inspire. A frustration voiced a lot these days — by art directors, writers, bloggers and others — is that people aren’t actually creating new things today. They are repeating, mimicking, collecting, downloading, endlessly commenting upon — activities that may be interesting and that may reflect the present moment but  are not about creating anything. One could even argue that they are the opposite of creativity and produce the feeling of being in a prison. Of course, when you consider the very real problems that many people in the world face, like hunger and shortages of medicine, these sorts of complaints sound silly.

And casting Ed Asner as a Nazi officer.) But those days are no more: Comedy Central said on Wednesday that it was not picking up “The Sarah Silverman Program” for a fourth season, confirming a report in The Hollywood Reporter. The series was barely renewed for its third season after Comedy Central sought to lower its budget, and Ms. Silverman, right, and her fellow producers said they would walk away from the show if they did. Ultimately a deal was struck in which Logo, the gay-theme cable channel, helped pick up some of the production costs. When many of those episodes were broadcast earlier this year they were shown by Comedy Central in a midnight time slot.

2010-05-13,Moms Love Godsmack?,"Big holidays often give sales bumps to certain albums, and Mother’s Day is no different, often helping performers like Michael Bublé or Neil Diamond reach No. 1. By that logic, though, the album on the top of the new Billboard album chart is a bit of a head scratcher: “The Oracle” (Universal Republic), by the long-running, heavily tattooed metal band Godsmack. It sold 117,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and is the band’s third album to open at No. 1. But mothers — or those who shop for them — may have helped a number of other acts reach high on the chart. The Christian soft-rock group MercyMe opened at No. 3 with “The Generous Mr. Lovewell” (INO), which had 88,000 sales; “Live at the Troubadour” (Hear Music), by Carole King and James Taylor, bowed at No. 4 with 78,000; and sales of Mr. Bublé’s “Crazy Love” (143/Reprise) nearly doubled from the week before, to 29,000, lifting it seven spots to No. 15. Also on this week’s album chart, the pop-country band Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” (Capitol Nashville) holds at No. 2 with 97,000 sales, and Justin Bieber’s “My World 2.0” (Island) falls one spot to No. 5 with 64,000. Last week’s top seller, “The Adventures of Bobby Ray” (Rebel Rock/Grand Hustle/Atlantic) by the 21-year-old rapper B.o.B., dropped to No. 12, giving it the dubious distinction of being the first No. 1 this year to fall straight out of the Top 10 the following week.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/arts/music/13arts-MOMSLOVEGODS_BRF.html

The ruling disappointed the church leadership, which wanted to develop part of the site, a plan that involved tearing down part of the building. “Forced landmarking has the effect of imposing the governmental idea of mission on the congregation,” the church’s pastor, the Rev. Dr. Robert L. Brashear, said in an interview on Wednesday. “There is a profound church-state issue here. Religious liberty has not been well served by this decision.” Dr. Brashear estimated that it would cost $11 million to $12 million to restore the church, which has been closed about two years because of physical deterioration. The congregation, which has dwindled over the years, has been meeting at the nearby Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew. The 116-year-old West Park Church was designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in January. Gale A. Brewer, a city councilwoman from the Upper West Side, who helped lead efforts to preserve the church, acknowledged on Wednesday, “There is a lot of work to be done.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/arts/design/13arts-LANDMARKDESI_BRF.html

While whites who did not vote cited busy schedules more than any other reason, blacks listed illness or disability the most.

2010-05-13,Colleges Seeing No Downturn in Freshman Acceptances,"One measurement that selective colleges use to compare themselves is their respective admissions yields: the percentage of applicants offered acceptance who ultimately decide to enroll. A few institutions — including Harvard, Dartmouth, Cornell and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — have begun to report those figures for the freshman class that will take its seats next fall, and so far none have experienced any downturn in the midst of the sluggish economy. At Harvard, for example, more than three of every four applicants who received an acceptance letter had committed by the May 1 deadline to enroll, a slight increase over last year. (The university said it still expected to offer acceptance to as many as 75 applicants on its waiting list.) At Dartmouth, the yield for the new freshman class was 55 percent, an increase of seven percentage points; the increase was so large that the college said it might not have room for anyone on its waiting list. North Carolina said its yield was 53.3 percent (compared with 53.9 percent at this time last year). But that figure is likely to rise, as it does not include all responses to the nearly 350 wait-list offers the university made and whose replies are due next week. Cornell said its yield rate was relatively flat, 49 percent, as was that of the University of Pennsylvania, at 63 percent. Neither institution said it had decided its waiting-list offers.",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/education/13brfs-COLLEGESSEEI_BRF.html

Yet considering them as tools to support cognitive and behavioral change may hold potential. The automatic e-mailing of friends when a mood-tracking score signifies a lowered mood is a novel idea, but it left me wondering how this information is then integrated by the individual with the illness beyond the quick feedback from the friend.

But a concert production, “Songs From the Capeman,” presented by Mr. Simon at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2008, drew better notices, and now the Public Theater will provide the musical with another step on its road to rehabilitation.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/the-capeman-continues-its-comeback-this-summer/

2010-05-13,The Rise and Fall of the G.D.P.,"Whatever you may think progress looks like — a rebounding stock market, a new house, a good raise — the governments of the world have long held the view that only one statistic, the measure of gross domestic product, can really show whether things seem to be getting better or getting worse. G.D.P. is an index of a country’s entire economic output — a tally of, among many other things, manufacturers’ shipments, farmers’ harvests, retail sales and construction spending. It’s a figure that compresses the immensity of a national economy into a single data point of surpassing density. The conventional feeling about G.D.P. is that the more it grows, the better a country and its citizens are doing. In the U.S., economic activity plummeted at the start of 2009 and only started moving up during the second half of the year. Apparently things are moving in that direction still. In the first quarter of this year, the economy again expanded, this time by an annual rate of about 3.2 percent.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16GDP-t.html

Chicago scholars tend to be social scientists at heart, contrarian but empirical, following evidence to logical extremes. They are centrally interested not in what it is like to be an individual within society but in how society washes over individuals, making and remaking them. During the campaign, when his former Chicago colleagues were asked to detail Barack Obama’s intellectual evolution, many of them described him in these terms. But they knew Obama, at best, only partly exhibited this tradition. His friend Cass Sunstein, who is certainly the most productive and probably the most influential liberal legal scholar of his generation, inherited it in full. “Cass has,” says Saul Levmore, a former dean of the law school, “the quintessential University of Chicago habit of mind.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16Sunstein-t.html

Mr. Izzard, the comedian and actor who will take over in the role of the lawyer Jack Lawson, made his Broadway debut in the 2003 revival of “A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,” the Peter Nichols comedy; he’s also an Emmy Award winner for his comedy special “Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill,” and looks smashing in drag (which he won’t be doing for “Race,” alas). “Race” is slated to run through Aug. 21 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater with a cast that will include Dennis Haysbert and Afton C.

Twenty-three years ago, in Turow’s best-selling novel “Presumed Innocent,” Sabich cheated on his wife, was charged with the murder of his mistress and, after a long and exceptionally messy trial, walked. “Innocent” finds Sabich — just turned 60 and still living, uneasily, with his wife — once more violating his marriage vows, now with a woman young enough to be his daughter: hence the shrieking heart, the italicized self-interrogation. It’s only natural that he feel a touch of foreboding in this situation. The age difference between him and his eager lover, a lawyer named Anna Vostic, is of course worrisome, as is the effect this new infidelity might have on his campaign for election to the state supreme court. Sabich has become wary of himself, spooked by the intensity of his late-life desire. But the greatest cause for concern while he’s conducting this affair is his wife, Barbara, who is, he knows all too well, dangerously unstable: bipolar and prone to rage.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/Rafferty-t.html

By the time the economy began melting down some months later, her series of collages, ""The Figures,"" started evoking a more collective state of mind.

In her work, missing assets fall through Swiss-cheese-like holes and risk tolerance appears as complicated as a Pentagon PowerPoint. According to Pines, the piece she created for this issue of the magazine, above, titled, ""Corporations,"" isn't just about the way accounting practices are ""wacky on such a large scale for so many businesses.""

Trifonova. A Moscow court ruled this week that Ms. Makarova’s April ruling to extend Ms. Trifonova’s custody was illegal. The death of Ms. Trifonova, who was suffering from severe diabetes and kidney failure, was the latest of several recent cases to underscore corruption and abuse in Russia’s prison system.

The theater and film designer Santo Loquasto created the costumes for the original “Ragtime” and for this season’s revival, and several of the costumes in both productions bore similarities. Costume designs that “substantially duplicate” work from a previous production are not eligible for Tony Awards, according to the Tony rulebook, but no one involved with “Ragtime” or the Tony Awards made a determination about Mr. Loquasto’s designs before they were announced on May 4 as among the four nominees for best costume design for a musical. In a statement on Thursday, Tony Award Productions  a joint venture of the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing, which oversee the Tonys  said that the revival’s costume designs were too similar to the original designs to be eligible. “We learned this too late to remove the costumes from consideration by the nominators but feel that we cannot allow the designs to remain in contention this year, and we must regretfully withdraw them from consideration as a nominee in the best costume design of a musical category,” according to the statement. “There will be no replacement made for the nomination, and voters will vote for one of the three remaining nominees.” The other nominees are Marina Draghici for “Fela!,” Paul Tazewell for “Memphis” and Matthew Wright for “La Cage Aux Folles.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/theater/14arts-RAGTIMEISSTR_BRF.html

According to Entertainment Weekly, Mr. Setoodeh contacted Mr. Murphy and is going to meet with the show’s writers to discuss why they found the piece so offensive and watch the creative process. In a letter Mr. Murphy sent to EW, he said that Mr. Setoodeh felt misunderstood and was receiving anonymous attacks.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/truce-in-gay-actor-debate/

An erotic current runs just below the displays of rectitude and purity, despite the hard pews and organ repertory. I suspect it has to do with the congregants’ concerted effort to suppress carnality in favor of distant heavenly rewards. Denying the flesh only makes it throb harder. It’s tricky to defeat one’s own biology, especially when young. It bubbles up during sermons as eyes and thoughts wander.

It’s tough to quote from the book in a family newspaper, but a few recent nuggets from the Twitter feed give a bit of the flavor. On being a proud papa: “A parent’s only as good as their dumbest kid.

Henry Ford needed rubber to make tires for his cars, and Europeans controlled the Asian markets. So in 1927, he bought 2.5 million acres on the banks of a tributary of the Amazon. The plan was not only to grow rubber but to share the benefits of Ford-style capitalism (high wages, moral improvement) with American managers and Brazilian workers alike. To that end, a replica Midwestern town was built in the jungle. It didn’t turn out well, Grandin (inset) explains. “ ‘Heart of Darkness’ resonates through every page,” our reviewer, Ben Macintyre, said. A quarter-century earlier, American workers in the Panama Canal Zone lived in settlements that resembled gated communities. In THE CANAL BUILDERS: Making America’s Empire at the Panama Canal  (Penguin, $18) , Julie Greene recreates the lives of the 60,000 people who actually built the canal — the unskilled laborers from Jamaica and Barbados who did the dirty, dangerous jobs, and the Americans in segregated neighborhoods who found themselves “as comfortable here as in Illinois,” in one visitor’s words.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

It features a photo of Chairman Mao’s paint-splattered face underneath the bold type: “The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship.” The book tells the true story of Lu Decheng, who threw paint-filled eggs at Mao’s portrait in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 protests.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/Parker-t.html

The bunkers’ blast doors were a yard thick, the roofs 25 feet thick. The British tried to destroy these submarine pens with hundreds of air raids and 12,000-pound bombs, but instead wiped out the town of Lorient. Only three houses were left standing by 1945, one of them a chateau occupied by the U-boat fleet commander, Adm. Karl Dönitz. “When, in 1987, filmmakers needed a set for the popular submarine movie ‘Das Boot,’ they simply moved into La Pallice” — one of the occupied French ports — “where the old machinery stood intact and dim Gothic lettering still proclaimed its exhortations and prohibitions from the unmarred walls,” Richard Snow tells us in “A Measureless Peril,” his evocative and at times moving account of the American role in the Battle of the Atlantic.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/Thomas-t.html

Avago, based in Singapore, filed the complaint a year ago, seeking to block fiber optic components like transmitters, receivers and transceivers made by Emcore in Thailand.

Two performers in the company’s new “Ring” cycle, created by the visual artist and director Achim Freyer, have criticized the production as dangerous for the singers and of dubious artistic value. “This entire production has been a trying and difficult time,” the tenor John Treleaven was quoted as saying by The Los Angeles Times on Friday. He also said, “The character development that I bring to the part is almost expunged by this clownlike makeup.” Mr. Treleaven, who plays Siegfried, said he had suffered two minor injuries on the raked stage. The Times quoted Linda Watson, who sings Brünnhilde, as calling the set “the most dangerous stage I’ve been on in my entire career.” She added, “It takes years to be able to sing a ‘Ring’ and to just toss this all away — he doesn’t say it in words, but his gestures speak louder than words.” Christopher Koelsch, head of artistic planning for the company, said in a statement on Friday that the company “places the highest priority on safety in our onstage environment, and takes every precaution to prevent incidents” and that “we are proud of the overall work, as well as the contributions of each individual within it.” Individual operas in the $32 million production have been performed since last season, and the full cycle will be presented starting late this month as the centerpiece of a Wagner festival.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/arts/15arts-CLAIMSOFSAFE_BRF.html

2010-05-17,The Mets’ Japanese Reliever Has an Immersion Progam in Spanish,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. - Before Hisanori Takahashi left Japan for the United States to play baseball for the Mets, he did a little light studying of English words and phrases from a CD he bought, so by the time he arrived at spring training he was able to wish teammates and reporters a good morning in their native language and express his thanks.  At the time, Takahashi assumed that one of the keys to his adjustment to a new country would be to learn the new language of his teammates. What he did not realize was that perhaps he was studying wrong language. For Takahashi, the native language of his closest teammates, the ones he has spent the most time with during games, is not English, but Spanish. Since opening day on April 5, the left-handed Takahashi has been stationed in the bullpen, where he is surrounded by six other pitchers, all of whom grew up speaking Spanish in places like Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico. He has picked up almost as much of their language as English, and lately Spanish seems to be gaining dominance.  ""He can really speak some Spanish,"" said Pedro Feliciano, a reliever from Puerto Rico. ""His English is good, too, but I think in the last few weeks he has learned a lot of Spanish words.""  Since his fellow Japanese reliever Ryota Igarashi was injured April 20, and soon after went to Florida for rehabilitation work, Takahashi was forced into a kind of bullpen Spanish immersion program. Now that he could be replacing Oliver Perez in the rotation, his next Spanish lessons may come in the dugout.  ""The English is a little bit ahead of the Spanish right now,"" Takahashi said through his interpreter, Yoichi Terada. ""But only a little bit ahead.""  Of course, since this is baseball, a vocation dominated by young men, some - but certainly not all - of the words Takahashi is learning are of the crude variety. Takahashi never could have predicted it that within three and a half months of his arrival in the United States, he would be able to hurl slang like a Caracas cabdriver.  ""He hears some words in the bullpen and asks me about them,"" the Venezuelan relief pitcher Fernando Nieve said with a smile. ""Some bad words. But it's the same with us in English. That's what we learned first, too.""  Before a recent game in St. Louis, Takahashi was standing near the dugout with the Dominican reliever Jenrry Mejia as they waited for batting practice to begin. At the urging of a reporter, Mejia looked over at Takahashi and said, ""Habla Español?"" and Takahashi replied without hesitation.  Mejia laughed and shook his head, then repeated the words in English to the reporter, words that could not be used in front of children or a television camera.  But Takahashi, who regularly greets his Latino teammates with proper Spanish salutations, is also learning language suitable for mixed company. He has a little black book that he takes with him to the bullpen. The book is primarily used to study the tendencies of opposing hitters, and when he is finished pitching he will write the results of each pitch, each at-bat in the book.  He also has a section in the back where he writes down new phrases he has learned in Spanish, like buen trabajo (good work), buena suerte (good luck) and even the saucier and even the saucier cállate, which means shut up.  When Takahashi and Terada went to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic in March to get his work visa, they came back raving about one aspect of the city. ""Cerveza Presidente,"" Takahashi said, referring to the popular Dominican beer.  As far as baseball terminology, many of the words like fastball, slider and bullpen are universal, so Takahashi has not had trouble with them. When catcher Rod Barajas, who is fluent in English and Spanish, goes to the mound, he speaks to Takahashi in English, and there is an understanding. But so far, those conferences have not been complicated.  ""Luckily, I haven't had a serious situation yet with all the infielders coming to the mound to discuss the situation,"" Takahashi said. ""Maybe that will come. But in Japan, when those situations came up, I wouldn't listen anyway. I didn't care about what they were saying.""  Takhashi's obvious sense of humor and his willingness to learn has endeared him to his teammates, especially in the bullpen, where they appreciate the circumstances he is facing. Feliciano, who played in Japan in 2005, is facile at languages and can speak some Japanese with Takahashi. But he knows it can be lonely at times.   ""I went through that in Japan, and I don't want him to go through the same thing,"" Feliciano said. ""No matter where you are from, I want everyone to be bullpen buddies.""  Or, as Takahashi might put it, compañeros del bullpen.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/sports/baseball/16takahashi.html

2010-05-17,Legal Threat for ‘Winnie’ Film,"Production on a film based on the life of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, right, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, is set to begin despite threats of legal action, Reuters reported. A letter from Ms. Madikizela-Mandela’s lawyers to the producers of “Winnie” stated that she would like to approve the script before production begins at the end of this month, according to André Pieterse, a producer of the film. “It was a benign letter and yet it contained the threat of an indictment, an interdict that could stop the picture,” Mr. Pieterse said. The producers have refused Ms. Madikizela-Mandela’s request, saying the screenplay, which was based on Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob’s biography, “Winnie Mandela: A Life,” was thoroughly researched. Jennifer Hudson is set to star in the movie as Ms. Madikizela-Mandela, along with Terrence Howard, who will play Mr. Mandela. The director, Darrell Roodt, said he was sure Ms. Madikizela-Mandela would support the film, which he called “an amazing love story.” He added, “we have such a perception of her, but it’s entirely the incorrect one, because she was one of the few saviors of South Africa.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/movies/17arts-LEGALTHREATF_BRF.html

2010-05-17,Downtown Theater Company Faces Eviction,"The Metropolitan Transit Authority has threatened to evict the experimental media and theater group 3-Legged Dog from its Lower Manhattan building. The authority notified the group on Friday that it would begin eviction proceedings on Monday if 3-Legged Dog did not pay the more than $306,000 it owes the authority in back rent and interest. The group signed a 20-year lease in 2002 for space at 80 Greenwich Street, now known as 3LD Art & Technology Center, agreeing to pay $21,666.67 per month there after its former location at 30 West Broadway was destroyed in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, The Wall Street Journal reported. Kevin Cunningham, 3-Legged Dog’s executive artistic director, confirmed that the company had fallen behind in payments when foundations withdrew financial support because of the recession. He also said the theater had been forced to spend its own money on building maintenance, including asbestos abatement, without reimbursement from the authority. Though he said he had offered to negotiate a payment plan, the two companies have been unable to reach an agreement. The authority’s spokesman, Jeremy Soffin, told The Journal, “I don’t know how anyone can justify letting this tenant rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent at a time when state cuts and deteriorating tax revenues have forced the M.T.A. to lay off station agents and cut service.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/theater/17arts-DOWNTOWNTHEA_BRF.html
2010-05-17,‘The Big Bang Theory’ Gets Syndication Deal,"Prepare to see “The Big Bang Theory” on television a lot more often. Repeats of the popular CBS sitcom have been picked up by the cable channel TBS and by local stations owned by Fox in what is believed to be one of the most lucrative TV syndication deals ever, executives announced Saturday. The parties would not disclose the terms of the deal, but Variety reported that it “set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase.” Warner Brothers, the producer and distributor of “Big Bang,” said stations’ interest in the series had risen steadily as it prepared to sell the repeats, in part because there are few traditional, multicamera comedies that attract a broad audience. “Big Bang,” which features Jim Parsons (above, with Mayim Bialik) is now in its third season and the highest-rated sitcom on television among adults aged 18 to 49. The repeats will start being shown on local stations and on TBS in the fall of 2011. TBS may schedule the episodes at 10 p.m. so that they lead into Conan O’Brien’s coming talk show on that channel.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/arts/television/17arts-THEBIGBANGTH_BRF.html

To supplement the exhibit’s iconic images of America’s car culture — Ed Ruscha’s gas station photos, Mary Heilmann’s abstract paintings of highways — Hoffmann gathered his own artifacts during a week long journey. He tried to buy a gun near Amarillo, Tex., at a pawn shop, but instead ended up with a ring in the shape of the lone star state. He attempted to finish off a 72-ounce-steak in one hour at Big Texan restaurant in Amarillo. “If you do, they comp your meal. I couldn’t do it but there was an episode of ‘The Simpsons’ where Homer did,” says Hoffmann, who decided to forego the doggy bag for a menu. The show features souvenirs like a rusty license plate from 1941, vintage rodeo photographs and even some regional flora and fauna. “I got stuck in a sandstorm in the Texas plains so we have some original Texas panhandle tumbleweed in the show.” The show is up through Sept. 5.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/now-showing-car-culture/

Over breakfast in March, we talked about a movement spreading across the country to hold public-school teachers accountable by compensating, promoting or even removing them according to the results they produce in class, as measured in part by student test scores. Mulgrew’s 165-page union contract takes the opposite approach. It not only specifies everything that teachers will do and will not do during a six-hour-57 ½-minute workday but also requires that teachers be paid based on how long they have been on the job. Once they’ve been teaching for three years and judged satisfactory in a process that invariably judges all but a few of them satisfactory, they are ensured lifetime tenure.

2010-05-18,Son of Zeppelin: Tribute Concerts Planned,"To the world John Bonham was the formidable rock ’n’ roll drummer of Led Zeppelin, who brought an explosive percussion style to songs like “When the Levee Breaks” and “Four Sticks.” To Jason Bonham, left, he was simply Dad, a man whose musicianship he did not fully appreciate when John died in 1980 at 32, when Jason was just 14. “I really wish I had the time to tell him when he was alive how much I loved him as a player, and his music,” Mr. Bonham said recently in a telephone interview. In that spirit Mr. Bonham, now 44, announced on Monday that he would perform a series of concerts in the fall paying tribute to his father and the music of Led Zeppelin. The lineup of musicians and tour dates is still being completed, but Mr. Bonham said the tour, called “Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Experience,” would perform 30 shows in North America in honor of the 30th anniversary of John Bonham’s death. Mr. Bonham, who in 2007 played with the band’s surviving members — Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones — at the O2 Arena in London, said he had not yet approached them about participating. “Of course, I would love to have them involved,” he said. “I had the time of my life working with them in that six weeks up to the O2 show, and to have been part of that, just for that moment.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/arts/music/18arts-TRIBUTECONCE_BRF.html

2010-05-18,Case Study | Looking East,"If you missed your favorite barkeep last Monday or Tuesday, it was quite possible he or she was packed into the Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel for what constituted the can’t-miss event of the year for the shake-and-stir set, a gathering that had cocktailian tongues wagging for months beforehand. Kazuo Uyeda, the reigning patriarch of Japanese bartending and self-professed inventor of the controversial “hard shake,” was making his first United States speaking appearance at a two-day seminar on Japanese bartending methods. As American cocktail culture has exploded over the past decade, cycling through every trend — from resurrecting 19th-century recipes and ingredients to molecular reinterpretation of drinks — a communal grasping has remained to understand the fastidious Japanese scene, which is focused in the tiny bars that dot Tokyo’s nightlife centers like Roppongi and Ginza, where Uyeda’s bar, Tender, is located. In the more recessed aeries of cocktail culture, an intense curiosity about and mimicry of the Japanese interpretation of the cocktail exists. It is safe to say that this fixation is almost entirely due to Uyeda’s reputation, and collective puzzlement over the hard shake.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/case-study-looking-east/

Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said he would leave office only after a no-confidence vote by Parliament. On Monday, the president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, had said he would appoint a new prime minister in an effort to end the longstanding rift within the government. That move immediately drew support from the United Nations special representative for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991, when the former government was toppled by clan militias and later turned against each other. The current transitional government, which was formed in a 2008 deal brokered by the United Nations, has failed to restore security and been weakened by constant attacks, roadside bombs, corruption, disputes, suicide bombers and piracy. Many analysts caution that the latest strife within the government institutions could result in a total breakdown. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/world/africa/19webbriefs-SOMALIA.html

Reeve Carney, the singer-frontman of the band that bears his name, is set to play Peter Parker and Spider-Man on Broadway, though he did not act in character while performing “Boy” at a luncheon honoring the musical’s director, Julie Taymor. In the musical, Peter Parker sings the number after his love interest, Mary Jane, has been abducted and his super-powers are gone. Before the luncheon, Ms. Taymor described the financial stakes of the musical as extraordinarily high, saying “Spider-Man” would need to be a huge audience hit on par with her Disney musical “The Lion King” to cover its significant costs and ultimately turn a profit. But she sounded a note of confidence, adding: “I’m not doing this for a small audience. I’m doing it for a world audience.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/arts/music/19arts-SPIDEYSSONGI_BRF.html

Identical twins share 100 percent of their genome, fraternal twins share 50 percent. All twin pairs, if raised together, share approximately the same early environment. So if a behavior is more common between identical twins than between fraternal twins, it is presumably being directed to some degree by genes.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/phys-ed-do-our-genes-influence-our-desire-to-exercise/

The Wilderness site is famous for two days of bitter fighting in May 1864 that left nearly 30,000 casualties — dead, wounded or missing. Other sites on this year’s roster are Hinchliffe Stadium, in Paterson, N.J., one of the last remaining Negro League ballparks; the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut, known for its decorative bridges and natural landscaping; and the Metropolitan A.M.E.

Tights were developed precisely by blokes on horses in forests. (They are cousins of riding breeches.) What’s the worst that can happen? You pass a briar, a burr is buried and you get a run in your tights? Man up, Robin Hood, you live life on the run. Crowe should not have cowed from the challenge of tights but since he has, we’ve compiled some great moments of men in tights.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/men-in-tights-a-brief-history/

Madoff and Mr. Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and writer, who lost several million dollars of his wealth as well as all of the assets of his foundation, in Mr. Madoff’s huge Ponzi scheme. Ms. Margolin told The Post that she had used Mr. Wiesel as a foil for Mr. Madoff because “his name is synonymous with decency, morality, the struggle for human dignity and kindness.” But Mr. Wiesel apparently saw the representation differently. After reading the script, he called the play “defamatory” and “obscene” and threatened to have his lawyer try to stop the production. Theater J’s artistic director, Ari Roth, suggested that Ms. Margolin revise the play and replace Mr. Wiesel with a fictional character.

Once I arrived, I found myself meandering along the most charmingly eccentric stretch of beach I’ve ever seen: a half-mile crescent surrounded by water (the crystalline calm of Christchurch Harbor to the north, the infinite whitecaps of the English Channel to the south) and peppered with salt-bitten beach huts the size of camping tents. It was late August, the height of vacation season, yet aside from a woman in a bathrobe walking her poodle along the shore this morning, the place was splendidly deserted.

2010-05-21,Deadline Extended in ‘Crude’ Documentary Lawsuit,"A federal judge on Thursday pushed back the deadline for a documentary filmmaker to turn over 600 hours of unused footage to Chevron. On May 6, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan granted a motion ordering the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over the footage from his movie “Crude” as part of a lawsuit accusing Texaco, now owned by Chevron, of polluting the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador. The company’s lawyers argued that the footage would show misconduct by the other side; Mr. Berlinger’s lawyers argued that his work should be protected under reporter’s privilege. The judge agreed that Mr. Berlinger enjoyed the privilege but ruled that it could be outweighed if the material was not confidential and “likely relevant” to the case. In a contentious hearing on Wednesday over whether the judge would stay his decision, Judge Kaplan made it clear he believed the chances of overturning were slight. In a 20-page opinion issued on Thursday, he wrote that he would not grant the stay but would delay the deadline for enforcing the subpoena from Friday until May 24, allowing all parties time to present arguments to the court of appeals. Lawyers for Mr. Berlinger filed an emergency appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, denouncing Judge Kaplan’s “unprecedented, blunderbuss order” and asking that it be overturned.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/movies/21arts-DEADLINEEXTE_BRF.html

The innovations have been well documented, and often lamented: the franchises that deserted New York and its scruffy urban pastures for the shiny lure of California; the dwindling number of afternoon games, played in weekday heat, in favor of televised night contests, with their floodlit lunar glare; the decline of the multitiered farm system and its flavor of the county fairground.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/books/review/Tanenhaus-t.html

Though Mr. Reubens, right, 57, is generally much more low-key than his impish, bow-tie-clad alter ego, his impending date with Broadway stirred a little Pee-wee style exuberance within him. “I can hardly believe it,” he said Wednesday evening in a telephone interview. “Honestly, I’ve been pinching myself.” In January, Mr. Reubens revived “The Pee-wee Herman Show” at Club Nokia at L.A. Live in Los Angeles, the first time in several years that he had played the character for a sustained period.

The event will be directed and produced by Damian Woetzel, the former New York City Ballet dancer, and the first half of the evening will be a tribute to the physicist Stephen W.

That left out most of the books published in 1970, which were never eligible to win the Booker.

2010-05-21,"Jil, Diffused","Yesterday was a bit of a crazy day so I didn’t get a chance to talk about the new Jil Sander Navy line. There’s not much to say, really. It’s a minimalist line aiming for friendlier prices in a world saturated with them. The standout piece among those presented was the print scarf dress, and I liked the crisp look of the trench skirt and the flattering cut of the slim pants. The kelly-green trench dress was cute, too. Though I saw connections to the Jil Sander aesthetic, past and present, those design values can be found in many places—Uniqlo, Calvin Klein, Banana. Last year, I bought a Jil Sander pre-season draped-front dress in navy cotton jersey for about $590. I’ve gotten lots of mileage out it, and it’s probably less money than some of the Navy pieces. So what am I getting? We’re all making those kinds of decisions about clothes. Is a $200 pair of leggings or pants really worth it or will I trade up to something with a little more design? Will I stick with a trusty designer label and just buy less? Clearly a task before the team designing Navy—which is not Raf Simons’ team for the main Jil collections—is to create smart, useful pieces that are a skip ahead of the “lifestyle” miasma.

The standard measure of core inflation tries to get at this ideal in a rough and ready way, by excluding food and energy; other measures exclude all prices that have changed a lot in any given month. But Bryan and Meyer use a more direct approach, looking at goods whose prices can be shown directly not to change very often; these core goods make up about 70 percent of the CPI.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/sticky-goodness/

Just as dizzying is the sight of an old case filled with deli meats, bacon and sliced ham, the top lined with bags of local grits and jars of sorghum, honey and the pickled relish called chowchow. In the rooms beyond, you can see more ham, more bacon, in various stages, from curing to cutting. “We accept food stamps,” reads one sign. It’s as humble a spot as you’re likely to find when searching for ground zero of American cuisine’s obsession with pork. And yet Benton’s has become a touchstone (if not a supplier) for chefs from coast to coast. Ssäm Bar, part of David Chang’s expanding Momofuku restaurant dynasty, serves a Southern ham plate: thin slices of smoky, salty American pork with red-eye gravy. In Chicago, Paul Kahan thrills Publican diners with country ham and cracklings. And the Manhattan bar PDT offers a Benton’s Old-Fashioned: bourbon infused with Benton’s extra-smoky bacon. Suddenly, the backwoods biscuit fixin’ has become the new prosciutto. ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/t-magazine/23talk-pork-t.html

2010-05-24,Fraught,"W.F. Young asks: ""Long ago I developed the expectation that on encountering the word fraught, I'd find it associated with a prepositional phrase, 'with [something].'  Now, in old age, I find that expectation dashed, often.  Can you say what it was based on and anything about when, how or by whom it was undercut?""  Here we have a case of a very old word undergoing a rapid shift in contemporary usage. In Middle English, fraught (an etymological cousin of freight) was a verb meaning ""to load (a ship),"" and the identical form could serve as a past participle meaning ""laden (with)."" While the verb dropped out of the language almost entirely, the past participle stuck around, typically followed by ""with"" and an object -- often a burden, whether real or figurative.  Fraught as a standalone adjective meaning ""distressed, anxious, tense,"" without an accompanying prepositional phrase, is a 20th-century innovation. When the word cropped up on William Safire's radar in 2006, he offered a line from ""King Lear"" as a putative early example: Goneril tells her father to ""make use of that good wisdom, whereof I know you are fraught."" But Shakespeare did use fraught with a preposition, whereof, and an object, wisdom, so it is in fact very much in line with the usage of the era. Lear was surely in a distressed emotional state, but that wasn't what his daughter was driving at.  By the nineteenth century, the metaphorical extension of the word had developed a new twist. Instead of the traditional phrasing, fraught with followed by an object (something usually unpleasant or unfortunate), the object could appear before fraught in a hyphenated compound, such as danger-fraught, pain-fraught or war-fraught. Thus if a moment was fraught with emotion, it could just as well have been described as emotion-fraught or in time as emotionally fraught, signaling the implied object in the adverb.  The first glimmers of fraught without even a hint of an object start appearing in the 1920s and '30s. The earliest example I've found so far comes from a 1925 serialized story by Henry Leyford Gates about a flapper named Joanna. In one installment Gates writes, ""It was Joanna who at last broke the fraught silence."" The lyrical phrase fraught silence, perhaps evoking pregnant pause, shows up again in books from 1934, 1946 and 1958. Another early use is in George O'Neil's 1931 novel about the poet John Keats, ""Special Hunger"": ""For Keats this was a singularly fraught circumstance."" Circumstances, along with anxiety-ridden situations, issues and relationships, would soon become familiar companions for fraught.  Standalone fraught picked up steam in the 1960s, attracting the notice of dictionaries and usage guides, but the last couple of decades have seen an even stronger uptick. In the texts collected in the Corpus of Contemporary American English from 1990 to 1994, only about 9 percent of the instances of fraught do not take the preposition with. From 2005 to 2009, however, the rate jumps to a whopping 30 percent. The usage has become a journalistic commonplace, as in the recent New York Times headlines, ""For New Stadium, a Fraught Coin Flip"" and ""Opera Companies' Fraught Seasons."" No doubt about it, we're living in fraught times.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23FOB-onlanguage-t.html

Judge Denny Chin ordered a June 8 hearing to consider a subpoena issued on May 6 by a federal district judge that ordered Joe Berlinger, the filmmaker, to turn over all footage from the making of his film “Crude.” The film focuses on a lawsuit by Ecuadoreans against Chevron over pollution in the Amazon said to have been caused by Texaco before Chevron acquired it. The subpoena will be stayed until the hearing, Judge Chin ruled. Ilann M. Maazel, whose firm represents the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, applauded Judge Chin’s decision, and called the subpoena “another last-ditch attempt to derail and delay justice in Ecuador.” Randy M.

2010-05-24,Motion Against Gallery Is Rejected,"A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday declined to give immediate help to an art collector who has been blacklisted by the South African painter Marlene Dumas, prohibited from buying new works by her after he angered her by selling an older work. The collector, Craig Robins, asserts in a lawsuit that he sold a Dumas painting through the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea in 2004 with an agreement that the sale remain confidential. But the gallery, which took over representation of Ms. Dumas in 2008, told her about it, Mr. Robins says, causing her to add his name to the blacklist. In court testimony, Ms. Dumas’s former dealer confirmed that the artist maintains a blacklist of collectors and dealers whom she believes to be speculating in her works. Mr. Robins says that the Zwirner gallery promised to help get him off the blacklist and to sell him new paintings but failed to do so. The gallery has denied the claims. Mr. Robins sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the gallery from selling three paintings in a show of new work, paintings that Mr. Robins contends he should have the right to buy. But Judge William H. Pauley denied the request for the restraining order, in part because Mr. Robins provided no written evidence of his claims against the gallery.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/arts/design/22arts-MOTIONAGAINS_BRF.html

But hours later her legal team posted bail of $100,000, according to Reuters, which allows Ms. Lohan to avoid jail by providing money that would be forfeited if she became a fugitive. Shawn Chapman Holley, Ms. Lohan’s lawyer, told the judge that the actress was stranded in France because her passport had been stolen at the festival.

The players, who are not related, were suspended by the league in 2008 because they tested positive for bumetanide, a diuretic banned by the league because it can mask steroids. The substance was in StarCaps, a weight-loss supplement that the players admitted taking. The players claimed in court that they were employed by the Vikings and therefore governed by Minnesota’s drug testing policies, which are at odds with the N.F.L.’s policy in some ways. Earlier this month, Gary Larson, a Minnesota district court judge, said that the N.F.L. was the players’ employer and that they were beholden to the league’s drug policy. On Friday, Larson said that the league could not suspend the players while they appealed that decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

So let’s take some time to celebrate Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, the most purely avid patron of high school football in all of Dillon (O.K. maybe all of Texas). I say “purely” because Buddy has been supplanted this season and last by the twisted Panther fanatic Joe McCoy whose interest in Panther football is more or less entirely a function of his obsessive control of his star quarterback son. Except for Julie Taylor no kid in Dillon really avoids abuse of some kind – mostly it is the abuse of absent parentage – but in young J.D. McCoy’s case the abuse is both emotional and physical. Joe McCoy is a really, really awful guy – venal, entitled, misogynistic- – and Buddy has finally had enough of him. Poolside at Joe’s giant house – a house that seems like one big wet bar – Buddy gives it to him and calls him a cancer for poisoning the well of Dillon football love with his base antagonisms and threats and psycho micro-managing.

2010-05-24,The Green Ogre Stumbles,"“Shrek Forever After” was No. 1 at North American multiplexes over the weekend but failed to meet even cautious expectations, probably because of franchise fatigue and pushback from consumers over the rising cost of 3-D tickets. The movie, from DreamWorks Animation, brought in an estimated $71.3 million, far from chump change but sharply below opening tallies for the franchise’s previous two movies, which did not have premium-priced 3-D tickets to prop them up. DreamWorks expects positive word of mouth and a lack of competition from other family films to help “Shrek Forever After” blossom into a substantial hit, much as the studio’s “How to Train Your Dragon” overcame a soft opening weekend. DreamWorks always expected the fourth “Shrek” to have a weaker debut than “Shrek the Third” (more than $122 million opening; $799 million global total), partly because of the franchise’s age. Last week analysts lowered expectations for “Shrek Forever After” based on prerelease surveys. Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company, wrote that those surveys pointed to an opening “below the $110 million to $140 million range we think the film needs to hit in order to meet investor expectations.” Other analysts had lowered expectations to $75 million to $90 million. “Iron Man 2” was second over the weekend with $26.6 million, for a new total of $251.3 million. “Robin Hood” was third with $18.7 million ($66.1 million total). “Letters to Juliet” was fourth with $9.1 million ($27.4 million total), and “Just Wright” was fifth with $4.2 million ($14.6 million total).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/movies/24arts-THEGREENOGRE_BRF.html

The so-called sit/lie law is scheduled to be heard before the board’s Public Safety Committee on Monday; San Francisco voters can expect to see it on the November ballot. Advocates for prostitutes and the homeless oppose the law. While proponents say it will be used to focus on aggressive behavior by some sidewalk dwellers, others see the law as an attack on the city’s most vulnerable, prohibiting them from sitting or lying down on the sidewalk from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. “It is extremely hard to stay moving your whole waking day,” Neil Donovan, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, told The New York Times.

The more formal rituals are matters of tradition, like  memorial services in the field and the escorts who accompany a dead Marine through his or her funeral back home. Some Marines are further memorialized in the names of outposts and landing zones; thus, “Combat Outpost Hanson” and the adjacent “Landing Zone Currier,” named after two Marines from Kilo Company, Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, who were killed several hundred yards from here in fighting against the Taliban in February. Other gestures are impromptu, spontaneous and intensely personal, propelled by feelings that take hold within young infantrymen who fight through ambush after ambush together, and who find, as their tattoos often say, that they are bound by blood and then by a set of memories that will be theirs alone for the decades ahead.",World,https://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/remembering-a-marine-step-by-step/

In his first solo exhibition with the Los Angeles gallery Blum & Poe, which opened on Saturday, the artist not only tinkers with scale, moving parts and myriad materials, but also grapples with big life issues like mortality, renewal and the passage of time. The centerpiece of the exhibition is a monumental kinetic sculpture called “Orrery,” a reference to apparatuses that represent the motions and phases of the solar system. A larger-than-life figure of a woman, at once benign and sinister — is she Mother Time, perhaps? — sits at a spinning wheel made of recycled plastic bottles. Everything about the sculpture is circular, interconnected and eternally spinning  — the woman’s ears, fingers and the bun on her head;  the spinning wheel and the circular platform on which she sits. Even the pattern on her dress, a motion illusion designed by a Japanese psychology professor, seems to spin. The effect is hypnotic as both viewer and figure cycle between the material and cosmic worlds.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/life-and-other-cycles-tim-hawkinson-at-blum-poe/

2010-05-26,Star-Driven Shows Helped Broadway Sales,"Broadway productions grossed a total of $1.02 billion during the 2009-10 season, which officially ended on Sunday, with premium-price tickets for star-driven shows like “A Steady Rain,” “Hamlet” and “A Little Night Music” (above, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Lazar) increasing box-office sales despite a 3 percent decline in attendance compared with the previous season, according to new data from the Broadway League. The overall gross of $1.02 billion was a slight improvement on the $1 billion gross for 2008-9, although the latter figure did not include box-office sales for the now-shuttered musical “Young Frankenstein.” That show’s producers did not provide weekly grosses to the Broadway League, an industry group of theater owners and producers that collects and publicly releases weekly box-office data. Factoring in “Young Frankenstein,” the 2008-9 season could have grossed up to 1 percent more money than the 2009-10 season, said Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of the Broadway League. Total attendance at Broadway shows during the 2009-10 season was 11.9 million. The season’s financial gains despite audience losses can be explained partly by the success of some plays and musicals that sold a portion of their best seats at a premium, for $300 or more, while other shows struggled to fill seats.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/theater/26arts-STARDRIVENSH_BRF.html

The message linked to an online video showing that Mr. Corman’s valedictory speech had appropriated material from Mr. Oswalt’s stand-up routine. The Twitter message drew an apology from the student and a statement by the university that it was “deeply distressed.” On his Twitter account Mr. Oswalt, right, a star of “The King of Queens” and “Ratatouille,” wrote: “Congrats to Columbia University valedictorian Brian Corman! Great speech.” The tweet included a link to a YouTube video of Mr. Corman’s speech, given on May 16 at the Class Day ceremony for the School of General Studies, in which Mr. Corman shared a story that seemed to come from his firsthand experience about a student who challenged a “Star Trek”-theme question on an exam. Mr. Oswalt has told a similar anecdote in his stand-up routine. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Oswalt said that Mr. Corman’s actions reflected a lack of respect for comedians. “In people’s heads they think that comedians can’t possibly make up their own material,” Mr. Oswalt said. “They must get it out of joke books.” In a statement Peter J. Awn, dean of the School of General Studies, said, “The student speaker has appropriately issued an apology to his classmates and to Mr. Oswalt for failing to provide such attribution.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/arts/26arts-COMEDIANNOTL_BRF.html

2010-05-26,M.I.A.’s Agitprop Pop ,"On the Grammy Awards in 2009, Maya Arulpragasam, also known as M.I.A., performed her biggest hit, “Paper Planes,” a rap song that infuses rebellious, defiant lyrics with the sounds of her native Sri Lanka, a riff lifted from the Clash, the bang-bang of a gun and the ka-ching of a cash register. Maya, as she is called, was nine months pregnant (to the day), and while she was onstage rapping about “some some some I some I murder, some I some I let go” — in a black skintight, body-stocking dress, transparent except for polka-dot patches that strategically covered her belly, breasts and derrière — she began to experience contractions. As the pain hit, Maya was performing with the male titans of rap (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, T.I.) and she later told me that she thought all the free-floating testosterone caused her to go into labor. While American rappers today tend to celebrate sex, wealth and status, Maya, who grew up listening to the politicized rhymes of Public Enemy, takes international dance beats and meshes them with the very un-American voice of the militant rebel. In contrast to, say, Bono or John Lennon, with their peacenik messages, Maya taps into her rage at the persecution of Tamils in Sri Lanka to espouse violence: while you’re under the sway of the beat, she’s rapping, “You wanna win a war?/Like P.L.O.

It would restrain 15 named individuals from a variety of activities, including weapons possession, trespassing and witness intimidation. It would also keep suspected gang members from associating with one another in a 100-block swath of the city and impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In other Bay Area cities, like Fairfield, civil liberties groups have attacked such injunctions as violations of constitutional rights. In Oakland, opponents argue that an injunction would do little to curb crime and much to prompt racial profiling. A report in The Bay Citizen said that a series of at least four killings put law enforcement’s focus on the north Oakland group. [The Oakland Tribune, The New York Times, The Bay Citizen]Proposition Billed as Antidote to Polarization | Proposition 14, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is gaining traction. The initiative would replace traditional primaries in state and Congressional elections with twofold elections. All candidates would run in the first round. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof, would face each other in the general election. Voters’ ultimate choice could be two Republicans or two Democrats, but it is likely that they would be the best-known or the wealthiest of the original field. Supporters say the measure would empower moderates and increase turnout. The state’s $19 billion deficit, high unemployment and low morale may help the measure’s chances; polls show a majority of voters favor it.

Now with summer arriving next week, I’m excited about a new take on my tried and true uniform: the summer chukka boot. Keds, makers of the classic canvas sneaks, have introduced the Champion Chukka, a high-top spin on their low-top. It’s a sleek take on the desert boot, done in breathable, lightweight canvas with a molded rubber bottom. The boots come in a bunch of colors, allowing you to coordinate, clash, neutralize or pop at will. I’m partial to the navy, which will blend with a rolled up jean or be a bit more of an exclamation point with a slender, rolled-up chino. The pale grey is another favorite, more akin to its tonal cousin in suede. These sneaks are also the perfect pairing for shorts, from Bermudas to cargos.

2010-05-28,Never Say Never: Jeffery Deaver to Write New James Bond Novel,"The next James Bond book will be written by Jeffery Deaver, the best-selling thriller writer, Simon & Schuster announced on Thursday. The novel, with the working title “Project X,” is expected to be set in the present day and take Bond to at least three “exotic locations around the globe.” It is scheduled for publication in May 2011. Mr. Deaver, the author of “The Bone Collector” and “Garden of Beasts,” said in a statement that he was thrilled to be asked by representatives of the Ian Fleming estate to write the book. “The novel will maintain the persona of James Bond as Fleming created him and the unique tone the author brought to his books, while incorporating my own literary trademarks: detailed research, fast pacing and surprise twists.” The book will be published by Hodder & Stoughton in Britain and Simon & Schuster in the United States. More than 100 million Bond books have been sold. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/never-say-never-jeffery-deaver-to-write-new-james-bond-novel/

But, really, what writer doesn’t recycle?

Where Sunstein’s notion involves understanding and leveraging human nature to promote essential behavior change, the governing mantra on topics like safe cellphone use, resource conservation and health care reform consistently seems to hinge on the imposition of iron-fisted mandates backed by punishments for noncompliance. This isn’t to argue that both pleasure and pain cannot have a role in affecting widely distributed individual actions. But social and environmental-marketing case history is replete with successes that came because policy makers clearly perceived the true strategic value of inspiring people to do the right thing before pulling out the big Draconian stick. In the world of governance, I think the technical name for that approach is “leadership.”JEF LOEBSan Francisco",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30letters-t-CASSSUNSTEIN_LETTERS.html

I was a day old, and she found a little tag on my bassinet that announced, “It’s a Girl!” In the next bassinet was another newborn (“a lot punier,” she recalled), whose little tag announced, “I’m a Boy!” There we lay, innocent of a distinction — between a female object and a male subject — that would shape our destinies.

Birth control would be legally denied them until 1967. Next door, in Switzerland, women would not be enfranchised until 1971. Such repressive circumstances account for both the fierce, often wrathful urgency of Beauvoir’s book and the vehement controversies this founding text of feminism aroused when it was first published in France in 1949 and in the United States in 1953. The Vatican placed it on the Index of Forbidden Books. Albert Camus complained that Beauvoir made Frenchmen look ridiculous. On these shores, the novelist Philip Wylie eulogized it as “one of the few great books of our era,” the psychiatrist Karl Menninger found it “pretentious” and “tiresome,” and a reviewer in The Atlantic Monthly faulted it for being “bespattered with the repulsive lingo of existentialism.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Gray-t.html

In January 2009, as Brandeis’s finances eroded badly during the recession, its trustees voted to “transition” the museum — founded in 1961 and the repository of works by de Kooning, Warhol, Lichtenstein and other major artists — into a teaching center and gallery, followed by “an orderly sale or other disposition” of its works in order to raise money for the school. In a telephone interview Jehuda Reinharz, the Brandeis president, said the university was now working with Sotheby’s, which approached it a year ago, to find ways to make money by lending works from the collection or entering into partnerships with other institutions. He said the university would be committed to using some of the income to benefit both the museum and the fine arts program. “The income from any kind of partnership or lease would generate fewer dollars, but on the other hand we’d still be the owner of the art,” said Dr. Reinharz, who last year announced his plans to step down as president as soon as a successor was named. A group of the museum’s benefactors sued the university in July 2009 to prevent any sales, and that lawsuit is proceeding. While Dr. Reinharz would not rule out the possibility that selling might still be necessary at some point, he said it was now unlikely.

It’s a fine book, and it gave me just want I wanted. Since I bought it, I’ve been regaling people with stories of Jacko, a dog owned by one Mr. J. Shaw of London that killed 1,000 rats in an hour and 40 minutes in May 1862; Mrs. Theresa Vaughan of Sheffield, who had had 61 bigamous marriages by the age of 24; and Dionsio Sanchez of Spain, who once drank 40 pints of wine in 59 minutes.

This “mighty — and mighty confident — work,” Dwight Garner wrote in The Times, “moves with force and conviction and imperious wit through Vanderbilt’s noisy life.” Self-made and ruthless, Vanderbilt achieved a near monopoly on steamship travel, then moved into the railroad business. (He built Grand Central Terminal.) He became the richest man in 19th-century America and inspired the term “robber baron.” This “state-of-the-art biography,” as Garner called it, won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/PaperRow-t.html
2010-05-28,The Hacker and the Hack,"If you’re a latecomer to the Stieg Larsson phenomenon, here, briefly, is the deal: Larsson was a Swedish journalist who edited a magazine called Expo, which was devoted to exposing racist and extremist organizations in his nativeland. In his spare time, he worked on a trilogy of crime thrillers, delivering them to his Swedish publisher in 2004. In November of that year, a few months before the first of these novels came out, he died of a heart attack. He was only 50, and he never got to see his books become enormous best sellers — first in Sweden and then, in translation, all over the globe.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Kamp-t.html
2010-05-28,Finding His Way to Paris,"James Lord, who died last year at the age of 86, is a tremendous storyteller. He brings dramatic intricacies to his encounters with Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Cocteau, Alberto Giacometti, Peggy Guggenheim and a host of other characters in the memoirs and recollections he published over the course of nearly half a century, from “A Giacometti Portrait” in 1965 to “My Queer War,” completed before his death. Sometimes I have the sneaking suspicion that Lord enjoys exaggerating his own role as the guileless young man, so as to push some hero or villain into higher relief. And he certainly knows how to grab a reader, beginning his portrait of another one of his friends, the Viscountess of ­Noailles, with this wealthy patron of the arts on her deathbed, shrieking, “I don’t want to die,” a tragic figure in a Parisian mansion hung with her peerless collection of work by Goya, Degas and Picasso. There is a fablelike power and a sensuous, seductive rhythm about the narratives as Lord unfurls them, a quality almost of myth­making that can feel a little old-­fashioned, but beautifully old-fashioned.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Perl-t.html

2010-05-28,Bare Necessity,"The sneaker seems like a dumbed-down version of the athletic shoe. As casual wear suitable for use in the yard, a nightclub or the office, sneakers compete (ferociously) on the basis of style and signaling power. Picking an athletic shoe, in contrast, has less to do with, say, drooling over stylish designs than with translating exuberant jargon. The Asics GEL-Kinsei 3 draws on “pure running science,” which evidently involves Spacemaster mesh containing “a nanoscale metal film” that reacts to weather — not to mention its new Propulsion Trusstic. Adidas’ adiSTAR Salvation W, meanwhile, offers ForMotion, which I don’t understand but is trademarked, as well as an Extended Torsion System, surely better than a Stunted Torsion System. Reebok’s ZigTech shoes promise to disburse a “wave of energy” along the strange-looking sole, reducing “wear and tear” on leg muscles by “up to 20” percent. Just figuring out which model to study on Nike’s Web site involves a multistep process concerning running surfaces, the shape of your foot and the specifics of your stride.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30fob-consumed-t.html

(DeLillo loves to write about the arts, especially film and conceptual performance pieces, though the parallels to his own work aren’t always so explicit.) Artists are at the heart of relatively recent books by Nell Freudenberger, Nick Laird, Olga Grushin and Stacey D’Erasmo, among many others.

The musical had received strong reviews at the Gielgud Theater but its producers, who include Cameron Mackintosh, said a confluence of factors had contributed to its closing. In a statement, they wrote: “Cameron and the U.S. producers have decided not to recast ‘Hair’ when the Broadway company finish their London engagement. The fall in tourism, the ash cloud and the election has caused a drop in audience figures, which has also affected shops, restaurants and hotels across London.” Meanwhile, another of Mr. Mackintosh’s West End productions may soon gain another familiar American face.

Mr. Fairey filed suit against The A.P. last year seeking a judge’s declaration that his poster was protected from copyright infringement claims. The A.P. then filed an infringement suit against Mr. Fairey, who has acknowledged that the poster was based on a photograph of Mr. Obama taken in 2006 by Mannie Garcia, a freelance photographer. On Friday, Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said in a hearing that “whether it’s sooner or later, The Associated Press is going to win” the case. Though Mr. Garcia has said that he was not working for The A.P. when he took the photograph, lawyers for The A.P. presented evidence at the hearing, including human resources forms and other documents, that Mr. Garcia was employed by the news service at that time and that the photograph was a work for hire. Geoffrey S. Stewart, a lawyer for Mr. Fairey, said, “Mr. Fairey would of course be happy to resolve his differences on an amicable basis with The A.P., but it does not appear The A.P. is interested in it.” Dale Cendali, a lawyer for The A.P., said, “The A.P. was very encouraged by the hearing today and remains committed to vindicating the rights of photojournalists everywhere.” George Carpinello, a lawyer for Mr. Garcia, had asked at the hearing to be removed from representing the photographer, but said in an interview that he would stay on and hoped to meet with The A.P. next week.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/design/29arts-JUDGEURGESRE_BRF.html

The four killed Cai Qianwen in October 2009 by shoving him down a mine shaft, according to the court in Yunnan.

Two assailants were given suspended death sentences, and two others were sentenced to 15 years in prison.

As we remember the heroes who laid down their lives for freedom, let us also spare a thought for a hero of the mind, who passed away some days ago at the age of 95. When I first encountered Martin Gardner’s columns in “Scientific American” as a schoolboy many years ago, my reaction was one of awe. Here was pure intelligence incarnate, I thought, coming up with puzzles of mind-bending difficulty month after month and explaining the ideas behind them with crystal clarity. I was convinced that Martin Gardner was the smartest man in the world. The profusion of his writings, their quality and the sheer length of time that he kept on producing them, month after month, were just mind-boggling. When he retired from “Scientific American” in 1981, I was convinced that no one could fill his shoes. Although I much admired Douglas Hofstadter, who replaced him, and was a great fan of “Gödel, Escher, Bach” I just knew that no one else could keep this up for as long as Martin Gardner had. And so it proved to be. It is a tribute to Martin Gardner’s oeuvre that the final considered impression that he left  is not very different from the one seen through the eyes of a hero-worshiping adolescent.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/numberplay-a-fond-farewell-to-martin-gardner/
