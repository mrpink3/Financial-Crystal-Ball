Cameron County (the southern tip of Texas) received anywhere from 5-9″ of rain yesterday, and it’s not over. An additional foot of rain is possible over these areas as the storm decays. Up by Galveston, nearly 2″ of rain fell as of this morning.

2010-07-02,‘Twilight Saga: Eclipse’ Devouring Box Office,"With “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” now playing in 4,468 theaters in North America  the widest opening on record  the movie’s vampires and werewolves are, as expected, setting the box office on fire. “Eclipse” sold $68.5 million on Wednesday (including the 12:01 a.m. showings), breaking a record for the biggest midweek gross in history, according to Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the series. (“Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” which sold $62 million on a Wednesday last summer, will have to make do with second place.) Opening-day audiences were 80 percent female, which has become standard for the “Twilight” series, based on the best-selling books by Stephenie Meyer. The question for “Eclipse” was never about whether it would have a big opening, but whether it would generate bang-up repeat business and lure even more fans to the franchise. The answer will come in the days ahead, but exit polls suggest that “Eclipse” could achieve those goals through strong word of mouth: CinemaScore, the market research company, said audiences rate the film an A, which is higher than the grade given to its predecessor, “The Twilight Saga: New Moon.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/arts/02arts-ECLIPSEDEVOU_BRF.html

2010-07-02,Prince Charles Defended for Criticizing Buildings,"A secretary for the Prince of Wales, below, said that the prince considers it his role to represent “the views of ordinary people” on architecture and urban planning, amid a dispute over his involvement in the development of the Chelsea barracks in London, The Guardian reported. Last week a London high court ruled that Qatar Diar, the property company of the Qatari royal family, had breached its contract with a partner company after it withdrew a planning application for a multimillion-dollar development designed by the architect Richard Rogers for the site of a former army barracks. In a letter, the prince wrote that Mr. Rogers’s designs were “unsuitable” for a site so close to the Royal Hospital, which was designed by Christopher Wren, leading Mr. Rogers to accuse the prince of “an abuse of power” and “unconstitutional behavior.” The high court last week said Prince Charles’s campaign against Mr. Rogers’s design was “unwelcome,” reopening the debate about the prince’s role in planning decisions. In the past he has criticized contemporary architecture while favoring restoration and preservation efforts. But Michael Peat, the private secretary to Prince Charles, told The Guardian that the prince opposed the designs because “it is part of the Prince of Wales’s role and duty to make sure the views of ordinary people that might not otherwise be heard receive some exposure.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/arts/02arts-PRINCECHARLE_BRF.html

Mr. Gervais, a co-creator of the original BBC version of “The Office,” and who starred as David Brent, the oafish paper-company manager who inspired Mr. Carell’s Michael Scott character, wrote on his blog (rickygervais.com) that Mr. Carell’s departure was “of course inevitable (and sad), but I wish him all the luck in the world.” He added: “It was expected of me, as executive producer, to persuade him to stay on. With syndication in full swing the more successful the show remains, the more billions we all make. It was tempting, but the truth is, I believe he is doing the right thing. He’s fulfilled his contract and more, and is a huge film star now.” Mr. Gervais, above left, suggested that Mr. Carell, right, “should move on, continue to do great work, and buy a new house every time ‘The Office’ is repeated somewhere,” but did not comment on the widespread suggestion that an ideal replacement for Mr. Carell on “The Office” could be Mr. Gervais himself.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/arts/02arts-GERVAISWISHE_BRF.html

Producers are still imagined as lean, fierce and manly, where consumers are seen as feminized, passive and fat. Alex Payne, a tech entrepreneur, found the iPad disturbing: “a digital consumption machine.” On the great tech site Boing Boing, Cory Doctorow — while resolving never, ever to buy an iPad — took the trouble to remind us that a consumer is (in the novelist William Gibson’s acid words) “something the size of a baby hippo, the color of a week-old boiled potato, that lives by itself, in the dark, in a double-wide on the outskirts of Topeka.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04FOB-medium-t.html

But while we may think we know what such a story looks and sounds like, Jane Mendelsohn uses her third novel, “American Music,” to quietly redefine the genre. Although the novel takes place over several generations and more than 80 years of American history (and nearly 400 years of world history), it’s less than 250 pages long.

2010-07-05,New ‘Spider-Man’ Finds Its New Spider-Man,"Usually the eve of a holiday weekend is an opportune moment for an organization to announce layoffs or to put out reams of documents for dirt-diggers to sift through. For Sony, this is the ideal time to announce that it has found a new actor to star in its lucrative “Spider-Man” movie franchise. The studio said Andrew Garfield, right, a relatively unknown 26-year-old actor, would replace Tobey Maguire as that red-and-blue web-slinger as well as his nebbishy alter ego, Peter Parker, according to The Hollywood Reporter’s Heat Vision blog (heatvisionblog.com). Mr. Garfield’s credits include the Terry Gilliam movie “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus” and David Fincher’s coming film about Facebook, “The Social Network.” The three “Spider-Man” movies that starred Mr. Maguire and were directed by Sam Raimi have sold more than $2.4 billion in tickets worldwide. But at the start of the year Mr. Maguire and Mr. Raimi left a planned “Spider-Man 4” film because of creative differences. Instead, Sony hired Marc Webb (“(500) Days of Summer”) to direct a new movie that will return Spidey to his modest origins. (And be released in 3-D in 2012.)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/movies/03arts-NEWSPIDERMAN_BRF.html
2010-07-05,Forging a Festival for Black Playwrights,"Does the world need another festival for emerging playwrights? Lynn Nottage, above, answered with an emphatic yes this week by hosting a fund-raiser in her Brooklyn home to benefit the establishment of the New Black Fest, a festival aiming to showcase innovative work by and about black people from around the world. Its organizers and supporters are busy raising money and seeking out advisers in time for an autumn inaugural festival, which would include readings and panel discussions. “This is not about separation, it’s about inclusion,” said Ms. Nottage, who won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in drama for “Ruined,” about women in a Congolese brothel. “It’s about inviting people who don’t get access.” Katori Hall (of the Broadway-bound play “The Mountaintop”) and Suzan Lori-Parks (“Topdog/Underdog”) were among the playwrights attending the benefit. By the end of the night, $7,000 had been raised as the hat was passed among about 45 people from the world of film and theater, including Sandra Oh (“Grey’s Anatomy”), Russell Hornsby and Chris Chalk (of the Broadway revival of “Fences”), Eisa Davis (“Passing Strange”), the directors Malcolm Lee and Charles Randolph-Wright, and David Dower, associate artistic director of Arena Stage in Washington. Ms. Parks said the new festival would not only nurture and introduce new talent but also help African-Americans “remind each other that we are a great and powerful people,” she said.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/theater/03arts-FORGINGAFEST_BRF.html
2010-07-05,Pee-Wee’s New Movie,"Our bow ties haven’t stopped spinning since Variety reported that Paul Reubens is working on a new Pee-wee Herman movie, to be produced by Judd Apatow, the writer-director of “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up.” The news has a lot of people wondering what such a collaboration will yield  “Not the least of which is me,” Mr. Reubens, above, in character, said by telephone. Mr. Reubens, who is preparing his live “Pee-wee Herman Show” for Broadway, has spoken often about two Pee-wee-centered film scripts he has written that would continue the adventures of his manic character, seen in “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure” and the CBS children’s series “Pee-wee’s Playhouse.” But what Mr. Apatow wanted, Mr. Reubens said, was “a reality-based world and a linear road movie.” So that’s the path that Mr. Reubens and a co-writer, Paul Rust, are working along, for now. The Pee-wee character seems synonymous with a youthful innocence, while Mr. Apatow has a sensibility that can be naughty and often rude  but, Mr. Reubens said, “So can mine.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/movies/03arts-PEEWEESNEWMO_BRF.html

2010-07-05,Lilith Tour Cancels 10 Concerts,"In a major blow to the 2010 Lilith Tour, that female-centered music festival has announced the cancellation of 10 of its planned dates this month and in August.

(Aug. 11); Birmingham, Ala. (Aug. 12); Austin, Tex. (Aug. 14); Houston (Aug. 15); and Dallas (Aug. 16), the tour’s press representatives said in a news release. An Aug. 8 date in Atlanta is still listed on the festival’s Web site (lilithfair.com). No immediate reason for the canceled dates was given, but disappointing ticket sales was the likely culprit. In a statement, Terry McBride, a founder of the Lilith festival, said: “We are in the midst of one of the most challenging summer concert seasons with many tours being canceled outright. Everyone involved with the tour would like to apologize to the fans and artists scheduled to play in these markets, and express appreciation for all the support for the festival’s return. Lilith remains the only tour of its kind, and we are confident that fans will be amazed by what each date has to offer.” The Lilith festival, which is playing its first dates since 1999, said that its kickoff performance last weekend in Calgary, Alberta, drew more than 9,000 concertgoers.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/arts/music/03arts-LILITHTOURCA_BRF.html

The budget passed by the Council on Tuesday includes roughly $150 million for the Department of Cultural Affairs, compared with the $159 million that was allocated last year. (The 2010 fiscal year ended on Wednesday.) Mayor Michael R.

But of course the point here — and the point of the show in general to a large extent — is that there are so few jobs actually worth having there. (And as far as Riggins’s squandering opportunities, it simply would not have felt in keeping with his character if he’d stayed in college. Not everyone is cut out for college and not everyone should be expected to go. Part of what is so painfully evocative about “Friday Night Lights” is that it gives us a sense of an America where very little is possible without an exit from small-time life or an education.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/friday-night-lights-watch-the-problem-that-transcends-race/

Gowns and dresses, not so much. The more form-fitting, the better. So tight pants or skinny jeans, sure.” Mr. Gunn also noted that the move away from bright costumes to more natural-looking clothing could be a plus. “I would imagine that this new look will allow Wonder Woman to morph into situations in a less noticeable manner and, thereby be even more effective at combating evildoers,” he said.

(Pro-whaling protesters in Tokyo, left.) Aside from police officers ending a few altercations between supporters of the film and angry nationalists, the protests proved to be no deterrent for moviegoers. “I didn’t know about dolphin hunting,” Tomokazu Toshinai said as he entered a theater. “Whether it’s TV or movies, Japanese have a right to know these things.” A theater in Nagoya said that it would show “The Cove” along with “Whalers and the Sea,” a documentary sympathetic to the Japanese whaling industry.

2010-07-06,Remains of Bobby Fischer Are Exhumed in Iceland,"The remains of Bobby Fischer, the American chess champion, have been exhumed at the cemetery of Laugardaelir Church in Iceland, according to a report Monday in The Reykjavik Grapevine, a magazine. The exhumation was ordered by the Icelandic Supreme Court to determine if Fischer, above, is the father of Jinky Young, a 9-year-old Filipino girl. Olafur Helgi Kjartansson, the sheriff of Selfoss, the town near the cemetery; the Rev. Kristinn Agust Fridfinnsson, the pastor of Selfoss; members of the local parish; medical workers; and several law-enforcement officers oversaw the exhumation, according to The Grapevine. Since Fischer’s death in 2008 there has been a dispute over his estate involving competing claims by Marilyn Young, Jinky’s mother; Miyoko Watai, general secretary of the Japanese Chess Association, who said she married Fischer in 2004; and two of Fischer’s nephews, Alexander and Nicholas Targ. The estate is said to be worth at least $2 million, and Fischer left no will. Marilyn Young filed her claim in Iceland last November. Among the documents she provided were pictures of herself with Fischer and Jinky, and postcards to Jinky signed “Daddy” that she said were from Fischer. She has also produced records showing that Fischer gave her money in 2006 and 2007 for Jinky, according to RUV, a public broadcaster. Ms. Young had sought to retrieve samples of Fischer’s DNA from the National Hospital of Iceland, where he died, but none had been preserved.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/arts/06arts-REMAINSOFBOB_BRF.html

Teachers and state and local workers in the past have accepted a social contract with government, exchanging a lower wage and loyalty in return for job security and benefits, most notably health and pension benefits. Today, job security no longer exists. Health benefits have eroded. Cutting pensions, or worse, converting to defined contributions, effectively ends the contract. The paradox for taxpayers is that the historic benefits package never made up for the wage differential, which resulted in lower taxes. It is already difficult to attract talent to public service; and you do get what you pay for. In exchange for sufficiently eroded benefits, governments and school districts will be forced to pay much higher wages, and taxpayers much higher taxes, for the same work.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11letters-t-THEENDOFTHEL_LETTERS.html

2010-07-06,Letter: What a Liberal Court Should Be,"Noah Feldman is correct that the current Supreme Court does notpossess a bold, liberal stalwart, but that does not mean that progressive judicial philosophy has lost significant influence on the court’s liberals. At least since Brown v. Board of Education, an underlying premise in the liberal vision is the idea that justice can be accessed through equality. This premise has been advanced as a central legal remedy to end segregated public facilities and unfair discrimination on the basis of race and gender. While it’s true that contemporary liberal justices may not express this philosophy in such expansive and bold terms as in the past, the premise of interpreting the Constitution in a way to ensure justice through equality has been a unifying liberal judicial vision for half a century and still plays a key role in contemporary liberal jurisprudence.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11letters-t-court.html

2010-07-07,The Case Against the ‘Malaise’ Speech,"My column on Monday made a disparaging reference to Jimmy Carter’s famous “malaise” speech (in which, yes, he never actually used the word “malaise”), citing it as an example of the pessimism bubble that inflated in late-1970s America. Recently a narrative has sprung up, on the “crunchy” right as well as on the left, that argues that Carter was prescient rather than over-pessimistic, and that America would be better off today if we’d heeded his indictment of consumerism and self-indulgence, rather than spurning him for the go-go optimism of Ronald Reagan. This is not a crazy idea, since in many ways the speech’s moral critique of American life was powerful, timely, and as applicable today as it was then. (Here’s a snippet: “In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns.”) You can debate whether it’s appropriate for a chief executive to play the prophet, but if Carter had stopped talking halfway through the address, confined himself to calling for moral renewal, and stayed away from economic policy, the “malaise” speech would look like a plausible indictment of the excesses of late-modern America — excesses that are very much still with us today, and contributed in varying ways to our current economic dislocations.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/the-case-against-the-malaise-speech/

He makes the essential point, which is that this incident reflects badly on Kagan, worse on the ACOG — but worst of all on the various judges who then assumed, in decision after decision, that the ACOG statement could be treated as The Scientific Answer to the partial-birth abortion question, pure and undefiled by any crass political considerations. “This is the scandal’s real lesson,” Saletan writes. “Judges should stop treating the statements of scientific organizations as apolitical.

A news release described the character played by Mr. Dreyfuss (whose film credits also include “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “American Graffiti” and “The Goodbye Girl”) as “an unexpected character from Nancy’s past.” The new season of “Weeds,” which has its debut on Aug. 16, will also feature as guest stars Alanis Morissette and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as well as Linda Hamilton, Peter Stormare and Mark-Paul Gosselaar, but not the show’s co-star Elizabeth Perkins, who previously announced she was leaving the series.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/close-encounters-of-the-weeds-kind-richard-dreyfuss-joins-showtime-series/

Paul Getty Museum at a Sotheby’s auction in London on Wednesday evening for $44.9 million. The price, which includes Sotheby’s fees, is a record for the artist at auction, outstripping an 1841 view of Venice, “Giudecca, La Donna della Salute and San Giorgio,” which sold in April 2006 at Christie’s in New York for $35.9 million. “This painting transcends even Turner; it’s his best, it’s Turner at the top of his game,” Scott J. Schaefer, the Getty’s curator of paintings, said in a telephone interview from London after the sale. “Turner often suffers from condition problems, but this painting has been behind glass for about 150 years. It’s never been touched.” The painting, which is in its original frame and had been on loan to the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh since 1978, depicts the Italian capital bathed in a cloudy light. It has been on the market only once before, in 1878, when it was bought in London by the fifth Earl of Rosebery, who briefly served as prime minister after Gladstone. It has remained in the family ever since. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/getty-buys-turners-rome-for-44-9-million/

Yet “Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel,” a documentary by Brigitte Berman opening in New York on July 30, depicts you less as a purveyor of soft-core porn than as a noble champion of First Amendment rights. Is that actually how you see yourself?  I think the major thing I managed to accomplish was playing some part in changing our social and sexual values, and I take a lot of pride in that. When I was in college, middle-class kids couldn’t live together before they got married. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11fob-q4-t.html

It is seeking a meeting with Fram Realty, which leases the building for $68,945 a month, and with city agencies to work out an agreement for lower rent to match current market rates and for a nonprofit tax abatement, Ms Peila said. A representative of Fram Realty could not be reached for comment.

But if you describe someone as “a filmmaker of rare talent and creativity,” as I did, and then they follow your vote of confidence by releasing “Lady,” “The Happening,” and now “The Last Airbender” (currently the worst-reviewed movie of the summer, below “Furry Vengeance” and “Sex in the City 2″) on an unsuspecting public … well, let’s just say I wouldn’t blame anyone who cited Shyamalan as exhibit A in the case against my critical acumen.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/the-persistence-of-m-night-shyamalan/

2010-07-08,Getty Buys Turner’s ‘Modern Rome’ For $44.9 Million,"J. M. W. Turner’s final painting of Rome, “Modern Rome  Campo Vaccino” (1839), above, was bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum at a Sotheby’s auction in London on Wednesday evening for $44.9 million. The price, which includes Sotheby’s fees, is a record for Turner at auction, outstripping an 1841 view of Venice, “Giudecca, La Donna della Salute and San Giorgio,” which sold in April 2006 at Christie’s in New York for $35.9 million. “This painting transcends even Turner,” Scott J. Schaefer, the Getty’s curator of paintings, said in a telephone interview from London after the sale. “It’s his best. It’s Turner at the top of his game. Turner often suffers from condition problems, but this painting has been behind glass for about 150 years. It’s never been touched.” The painting, which is in its original frame and had been on loan to the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh since 1978, depicts the Italian capital bathed in a cloudy light. It has been on the market only once before, in 1878, when it was bought in London by the fifth Earl of Rosebery, who briefly served as prime minister after Gladstone. It has remained in the family since. (One of the earl’s descendants, Harry Dalmeny, is deputy chairman of Sotheby’s in Britain.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/arts/design/08arts-GETTYBUYSTUR_BRF.html

It is seeking a meeting with Fram Realty, which leases the building for $68,945 a month, and with city agencies to work out an agreement for lower rent to match current market rates and for a nonprofit tax abatement, Ms Peila said.

2010-07-09,Coming ABC Cop Show Drops Its Documentary-Style Look,"ABC is stripping the fake-documentary feeling out of “Detroit 1-8-7,” its coming cop drama, New York Magazine reported on Wednesday. When the series was announced in May, ABC said it would be similar to the sitcoms “The Office” and “Modern Family,” which have characters talking directly to the camera, as in a documentary. But the network recently decided to reshoot some scenes in the first episode so that there were no more nods to an imaginary camera crew. ABC was worried that the style would put distance between the characters and the audience, but real-life events also had an effect. Just days after the series was announced, The Detroit News reported that the city’s mayor, Dave Bing, had banned camera crews from riding along with police officers. The decision followed the death of a 7-year-old Detroit girl during a police raid being filmed by the A&E cable channel. “We’re trying to do a show that’s realistic,” an executive producer of the show, Jason Richman, told the magazine. “And we suddenly found ourselves with a premise that would no longer be viable.” ABC has another fake documentary this fall, a relationship drama called “My Generation.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/arts/television/09arts-COMINGABCCOP_BRF.html

Scott Rudin, a producer of the film, said it was told in an “All About Eve” style, from multiple points of view, including the perspectives of other young entrepreneurs who sued Mr. Zuckerberg, saying the site was their idea. “Everybody believes they’re right,” Mr. Rudin said in a telephone interview. “But the movie leaves you to make up your own mind about what you feel about how Facebook was founded.” The film festival will have the premiere on Sept. 24, before the movie is released Oct. 1. The festival runs through Oct. 10, with additional films to be announced.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/movies/09arts-FINCHERMOVIE_BRF.html

The ambitious project made its debut in 2009 at the academy with Mr. Mendes directing a single cast of British and American actors in productions of Shakespeare’s “Winter’s Tale” and Chekhov’s “Cherry Orchard” that later traveled to Britain, Singapore, New Zealand, Spain, Germany and Greece. The second installment, featuring “As You Like It” and “The Tempest,” was done in Brooklyn this year. Mr. Mendes directed the productions, currently in repertory at the Old Vic, where Kevin Spacey is artistic director.

The Western landscape is a strong component in the book, yet this is one of the few passages that allude to Montana’s Big Sky. Instead, Doig concentrates on interior ­spaces: the majestic town library, the modest dining room of the fetching widow Grace Faraday’s boarding house, and the most deeply interior settings of all — the copper mines, where men labor under perilous conditions. Butte suffers from a violent history, and the mining industry plagues daily life. Grace’s husband died in a mining fire, and her boarding house frequently shakes from underground ­dynamite.

2010-07-09,Art as Security System,"I’ve never spent time in Detroit, but I’ve seen an awful lot of images of the city in the last several years. And those images have been pretty awful, offering a version of the place defined by abandonment and decline. “Ruins porn,” as it’s been called, undermines even hopeful tales of creative renewal. The idea that artists can treat the city like a canvas ends up suggesting that it is a lost cause, an entire metropolitan area written off as raw material for upcycling. The net effect is a part of America depicted as if it exists in some distant reality — somebody else’s problem, nothing to do with us.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11fob-consumed-t.html

2010-07-09,"In the Name of the Father, the Sons . . .","Belief in the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth and belief in the virtue of his teachings are not at all the same thing. Writing to John Adams in 1813, having taken his razor blade to the books of the New Testament and removed all “the artificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests,” Thomas Jefferson said the 46-page residue contained “the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man.” Ernest Renan, in his pathbreaking “Life of Jesus” in 1863, also repudiated the idea that Jesus was the son of God while affirming the beauty of his teachings. In rather striking contrast, C. S. Lewis maintained in his classic statement “Mere Christianity”: “That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of hell. You must make your choice.

2010-07-09,Love’s Pestilence,"Since 1998, the New York Public Library has housed a manuscript so blistering that researchers are probably required to don oven mitts before handling it. Consisting of a long-overlooked autobiographical fragment by Claire Clairmont, who was Mary Shelley’s stepsister, Lord Byron’s lover and the inspiration for Henry James’s “Aspern Papers,” it has the declared intention of showing what “evil passion” sprang from the pursuit of free love by Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. “Under the influence of the doctrine and belief of free love,” Clairmont states, “I saw the two first poets of England . . . become monsters of lying, meanness, cruelty and treachery — under the influence of free love Lord B became a human tyger slaking his thirst for inflicting pain upon defenceless women.” Her indictment, which Daisy Hay says is now being published for the first time, comes only at the end of “Young Romantics” yet sends a blast of scorching fury back across the entire book. For Clairmont’s charges, however hyperbolic, have about them a degree of truth. Not just for her but for Mary Shelley and other women, participating in the communal, proto-1960s life of “English poetry’s greatest generation,” as Hay’s subtitle puts it, was ultimately less thrilling than damaging. This, at least, is the dominant impression I took away from “Young Romantics,” even if it isn’t Hay’s thesis or even drift.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/books/review/Downing-t.html

Instead of embarrassment or excitement or surprise — or horror or nostalgia or curiosity — she feels little in response to these erotic items strewn about her thousand-dollar-a-week accommodations. Since many middle-class women from New England traveling alone for the first time in 30 years wouldn’t be so unflappable, Yvonne’s story can be seen from the start as an unusual and engrossing exploration of marriage, parenthood and the accidents that can end and reconfigure lives.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/books/review/Emmons-t.html

2010-07-09,For Goodness’ Sake,"Secure your own oxygen mask before assisting anyone else, we are urged at the beginning of every flight. Altruism often requires that we take care of ourselves first, which is exactly what the subject of Oren Harman’s enthralling book “The Price of Altruism” tragically failed to do. The scientist George Price was an obscure and enigmatic figure, unknown outside his field of study. Born near New York City in 1922 and originally trained as a chemist, Price worked on the Manhattan Project, at Bell Labs and at I.B.M. before moving to London in 1967, after botched surgery for thyroid cancer. There he became a population geneticist and tried to solve the mystery of altruism with brilliant mathematical formulas. He had trouble solving his own problems, though. Having shown little sensitivity to others in his previous life (he abandoned his wife and daughters and was a lousy son to his aging mother), Price swung to the other extreme. Long a staunch skeptic and atheist, he became a devout Christian, gave up all his possessions and dedicated himself to caring for the city’s vagabonds. By the age of 50, he was as gaunt as an old man, with rotting teeth and a raspy voice. He killed himself in 1975.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/books/review/deWaal-t.html

In “Sugar: A Bittersweet History,” her thorough, workmanlike new study, Elizabeth Abbott reminds us that this has been true for centuries. A hundred years before Pushkin described ecstasy as “a glassful of tea and a piece of sugar in the mouth,” the demands of the sugar economy had ripped apart African communities and forced slaves across the Atlantic to work sugar cane plantations. Abbott’s book, which discusses the effects of sugar on everything from the Haitian revolution to Hitler’s Germany, serves as a grim reminder that a consumer’s choices register on a gigantic scale, and are therefore as much political as personal.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/books/review/Chotiner-t.html

He would HATE that.” While Hitchens himself doesn’t seem to have issued any official directives, prayers have rolled in from Elizabeth Scalia (no relation to the Supreme Court justice) at First Things, Greg Kandra at The Deacon’s Bench and Pat Archbold at The National Catholic Register.

It allows viewers to vote on every detail of a couple’s wedding, which is then broadcast live on the show. Even though same-sex couples will now be allowed to apply, it does not guarantee an appearance. “Today” producers sort through the applications and pick four finalist couples, and viewers take it from there, voting for which one should actually win the wedding and the all-expenses-paid honeymoon.

During its 90 years in operation, the playhouse has presented productions  most recently “Looped,” starring Valerie Harper  that have moved to Broadway, but it has also closed and filed for bankruptcy before. News of the playhouse’s struggles led to a $1 million matching pledge from anonymous donors, which helped to put the theater on better footing. The city, along with the theater’s board, staff members and advisers, “have all combined to create a plan to resurrect the Playhouse from years of unbearable debts,” the theater’s executive director, Stephen Eich, said in a statement. “Although we will be moving slowly in the future to ensure financial responsibility and stability, we will in fact be back.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/theater/10arts-PASADENAPLAY_BRF.html

He hammered on I-beams and guardrails, whacked thick cables, sent steel pellets down the inside of a bridge tower and recorded the sounds. Mr. Bertolozzi, of Beacon, N.Y., turned them into a composition, “Bridge Music,” which can now be heard at listening stations on each side of the bridge, as well as at 95.3 FM on the radio in parks at either end. Now in his sights: the Eiffel Tower. Mr. Bertolozzi, armed with testimonials from politicians and music experts and the fruits of his bridge labors, wants to do something similar on the monument in Paris. He submitted his proposal to the Paris mayor’s office, which referred the matter to the Eiffel Tower’s administration. A tower spokeswoman, Marthe Ozbolt, said in an e-mail message that the request was being taken seriously and would be examined. Ms. Ozbolt noted that the project was linked to the tower’s 125th anniversary, in 2014, “So there is still time!” Mr. Bertolozzi said he was encouraged. “I can’t believe it, man,” he said. “It’s not a definite yet, but hey, it’s moving in baby steps.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/arts/music/10arts-MUSICFROMABR_BRF.html

The painting is fashioned after Rembrandt’s “Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.” The congress issued a statement on Saturday in which it called the painting “racist” and condemned the work as “an act of witchcraft” and “an affront to values of our society.” Mr. Damaso told The Saturday Star that he did not mean to disrespect Mr. Mandela, who turns 92 on Sunday and is in frail health, but rather to honor him. “He achieved great things by working hard, and he has so much influence on the country and the world, but the painting shows that he is just an ordinary man,” Mr. Damaso said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/arts/design/12arts-ANARTISTISCH_BRF.html

Nevertheless, the all-American boy-makes-good clichés don’t quite ring true. Hamilton may have Midwestern roots and a C.V. that includes stints at Ralph Lauren and J. Crew, but his sympathies are more British punk than Ivy League preppy — it’s not hard to imagine Joe Strummer, circa 1980, suiting up in one of Hamilton’s rapier-thin blazers. (His women’s line, which he introduced last fall, is equally sharp.) And his references tend to be peppered with black humor. His spring 2011 men’s collection, which was scheduled to be staged during the recent men’s shows in Paris but was canceled at the last minute due to budgetary constraints, was inspired by the Belgian artist Michaël Borremans’s somber portraits of workers in their uniforms. “The surfaces were very chic and painterly,” Hamilton explains. “But they all looked depressed — that’s where the dark part comes in.” The Moment caught up with Hamilton to talk about his love of British youth culture and why the Corn Belt is more avant-garde than you might think.

HitFix.com reported that Marvel was not asking Mr. Norton, who played Bruce Banner and his alter ego in “The Incredible Hulk,” to reprise his role in “The Avengers,” a film planned for 2012 that will unite some of the company’s best-known superheroes. Marvel said its decision “is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members.” In a swift rebuttal, Mr. Norton’s agent Brian Swardstrom wrote to HitFix.com that Marvel’s statement was “a purposefully misleading, inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light.” Marvel cast Mr. Norton to portray the Banner and Hulk characters for a 2008 remake after a 2003 “Hulk” movie was a box office disappointment.

We Sox fans didn’t need to hate him; serious Yankee fans did that for us, bemoaning the constant psychodrama, the managerial revolving door, the ill-advised spending sprees and the trades that always seemed to ship off good young players to get veterans who were just about to pass their peak. Those were the Yankees of Steve Trout and Ed Whitson, Andy Hawkins and Mel Hall, the Ken Phelps-for-Jay Buhner trade and the long slow decline of Don Mattingly, their only true 1980s great. And then they were the Yankees of Howard Spira, the gambler who Steinbrenner paid to gather dirt on Dave Winfield, leading to the Yankee owner’s suspension from baseball “for life”  in 1990.

Cortez Bryant, the chief executive of Lil Wayne’s Young Money record label and a co-manager of the rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Carter Jr, told Vibe.com that he is planning to put out a new EP of Lil Wayne material,  “I’m Not a Human Being,” even sooner. “I’ll probably drop it on his birthday, Sept. 27,” Mr. Bryant said, adding that he would probably “put it out virally and maybe package it up for Christmas.

Critics liked to trash the glamorous — as they did the photographs Julius Shulman took of Neutra’s Kaufmann Desert House, published in Life magazine in 1949 — as tawdry eye candy, too eager to sell itself, too beautiful to be proper modern architecture, doomed to be mere fashion. But glamour, Professor Friedman proposes, is no mere aesthetic; it is a sensual, emotional and magical sensibility that percolated up from American popular culture, elevating the ordinary — a toaster, say — into the extraordinary.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/garden/15qna.html

So on Tuesday night he went to the Eugene O’Neill Theater and watched his own family’s complicated history unfold onstage, where afterward Mr. Kuti hugged the actress Lillias White, above, as Sahr Ngaujah, who plays Fela, talked to the crowd. Mr. Kuti had vowed to see “Fela!” only if the show were brought to Lagos, where in the 1970s Fela built a nightclub and residential compound to perform and criticize the corruption and human rights abuses of Nigeria’s military rulers. But arriving in New York from a show in Philadelphia, he watched the World Cup final with Stephen Hendel, a producer of “Fela!” During the game, “I made him a promise that the show will go to Lagos,” Mr. Hendel said as he escorted Mr. Kuti to his seat.

It was arguably the most buzz-worthy moment on “The Hills” this season, its sixth and last on MTV. The once-innovative show has been waning, having peaked in its third season with an average of 3.8 million viewers. This season it was averaging 2.3 million, and Tuesday’s finale was watched by 2.95 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Company. On a live “after party” after the finale on Tuesday, Mr. Jenner said: “As you saw in the end  what’s real and what’s fake? You don’t know. Our relationship the entire time could have been fake.

2010-07-15,Appeals Court Hears Arguments Over Outtakes,"Lawyers appeared in front of a federal appeals panel in Manhattan on Wednesday for arguments about whether a filmmaker should be required to turn over to the Chevron Corporation roughly 600 hours of unseen footage from a documentary he made about a class-action lawsuit over pollution in the Amazon. In May a federal district judge ordered the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over outtakes from “Crude,” the documentary that he made about the suit brought in Ecuador against Texaco  now owned by Chevron  charging that the company contaminated drinking and bathing water in Amazonian rain forests. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan had ruled that the footage could be subpoenaed because it fit the standard established by precedent: it was nonconfidential, was likely of relevance to the case being tried and could not be otherwise obtained by the defense. Maura J. Wogan, an attorney for Mr. Berlinger, vigorously disputed those determinations, telling a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that Judge Kaplan had issued “a broad and unprecedented order” that would result in a chilling effect on her client and on other journalists if upheld. Speaking a few minutes later, Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, told the judges that “this is a case about plaintiffs’ lawyers who decided that they wanted to star in a movie,” and so could not believe that their actions would remain private. As the proceeding progressed the judges signaled that they might narrow the focus of Judge Kaplan’s decision and perhaps require Mr. Berlinger to produce a smaller amount of material.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/movies/15arts-APPEALSCOURT_BRF.html

Mr. Broad has considered at least two other sites for the museum, which he has pledged to build with his own money  up to $100 million for construction and $200 million more for an endowment. He had explored the possibility of leasing the downtown site for $1, a common arrangement for cultural institutions, but that idea was criticized by Michael Antonovich, a Los Angeles County supervisor. In an interview Mr. Broad said such criticism “blows my imagination, frankly,” adding that “any city in America would like to get a museum built if they didn’t have to pay for it.” But a spokeswoman for Mr. Broad told The Times that he had changed his mind about the lease because he wanted “everyone to be supportive and satisfied.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/arts/design/15arts-ELIBROADUPSH_BRF.html

In the late 1970s, Mr. Marclay, an artist-composer-performer, became one of the first musicians to use a turntable as an instrument, but he is equally known in the art world for music-related collages and skillfully edited videos. His penchant for placing equal emphasis on the visual and the aural permeates the Whitney show. Most of the works on display — whether they are made of found objects, images, album covers, LPs, clothes, film footage or texts — can be used as musical scores. And they will be used, often several times during the show’s run, by a rotating roster of musicians that includes some of the biggest names from the avant-garde music scene. An artist as dedicated to mixing media as Mr. Marclay deserves the attention of critics from more than one discipline.

The kids should be back in school, so we hoped that we would be able to work without too much disruption. Wilson drove over just after sunrise to begin setting up while I finished getting a few things ready at camp. While walking over to the village a few minutes later, I noticed a large mixed-species flock of starlings foraging on the ground in an enclosed area of houses. Although Wilson had found a few smaller flocks foraging in the village, they were moving around quickly and would be difficult to catch. We decided to move our gear to this new area instead. Within a few minutes of setting out the traps, the birds were cautiously exploring our bait. In under an hour, we caught three birds — all superb starlings.

Then I don’t need you. Comic-Con, which starts on Thursday in San Diego, decided recently that “Piranha 3-D” footage Mr. Aja planned to show at the convention was too graphic and that he could tone it down to, say, the PG-13 level or have a panel discussion without it. Mr. Aja, whose films include “The Hills Have Eyes,” went with a third option. The “Piranha 3-D” presentation will now take place at 10 p.m. Thursday at the UA Horton Plaza, a theater near the San Diego Convention Center. “It’s frustrating,” Mr. Aja said by phone from Montreal, where he is finishing the picture, “because I was so excited to show this at Comic-Con  I made the movie for that crowd.” Yes, but “Piranha 3-D,” out Aug. 20, wouldn’t have captured nearly as much attention with the initial plan.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/movies/16arts-PIRANHA3DSCE_BRF.html

When Mr. Armstrong took over the Guggenheim in 2008 from Thomas Krens, who began the Abu Dhabi project, the Guggenheim said Mr. Krens would continue consulting on it, setting up what seemed like a potentially difficult power-sharing arrangement. But the Guggenheim’s spokeswoman, Eleanor Goldhar, said this week that Mr. Krens’s involvement would conclude by the end of the year. Asked if that was a change of plans, Ms. Goldhar said that Mr. Krens’s role “was always connected to the creation of the building,” designed by Frank Gehry, rather than the planning of the museum’s program. But at the time that Mr. Krens stepped down as director, and as recently as last year in an interview in the Russian-language magazine Snob, Mr. Krens seemed to envision a larger role. Mr. Krens, who did not respond to requests for comment, pioneered the concept of the global museum during his 20-year tenure at the Guggenheim, opening branches in Bilbao, Spain; Berlin; and Las Vegas.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/arts/design/16arts-GUGGENHEIMDI_BRF.html

Later, Josh was shown calling Jake and breaking the news of their father’s death. He said, “We lost Dad, dude.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/arts/television/16arts-ADEATHPROVES_BRF.html

In March, the “Jersey Boys” playwrights, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, as well as two Four Seasons band members, Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio, sued Christian Hoff, J. Robert Spencer, Daniel Reichard and Michael Longoria, all alumni of that show’s cast. At issue was the touring production “The Boys in Concert,” in which the “Jersey Boys” veterans perform songs of the 1960s and ’70s, including some made famous by the Four Seasons. The suit contended that the tour misleadingly suggested a connection to the Tony-winning show. In a counterclaim filed last week in United States District Court in New York, lawyers for the former “Jersey Boys” stars said the creative team and Dodger Theatricals, among the show’s producers, were “motivated by petty vindictiveness and malice” and “using bully tactics better suited for the schoolyard.” They are seeking an injunction allowing them to continue the tour as well as damages of “no less than $1 million” and a jury trial.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/arts/television/16arts-JERSEYLEGALS_BRF.html

ROFL, which became familiar in the age of texting, stands for “rolling on the floor, laughing” and can serve as a shorthand response to the most ephemeral, silly and frankly unimportant-seeming manifestations of pop entertainment in the early 21st century: absurdly captioned pictures of cats, goof-off remixes of YouTube videos, unlikely Web celebrities, quick-hit visual jokes with unprintable punch lines and sporadic references to Rick Astley.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/magazine/18ROFL-t.html

2010-07-16,Is ‘One-Year Anniversary’ Redundant?,"Neale Gifford writes: ""One practice that annoys me is the use of 'one-year anniversary' or 'five-year anniversary' instead of 'first' or 'fifth.' Reason? Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""  Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)  The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""  What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/magazine/18onlanguage-anniversary.html

2010-07-16,Man as an Island,"In the late 1960s, some 15 years after the publication of “Lord of the Flies,” William Golding confessed to a friend that he resented the novel because it meant that he owed his reputation to what he thought of as a minor book, a book that had made him a classic in his lifetime, which was “a joke,” and that the money he had gained from it was “Monopoly money” because he hadn’t really earned it. Golding was drinking heavily at the time (he had a lifelong struggle with alcoholism) and one may have to take his bitterness advisedly, but these remarks reveal an interesting artistic conundrum. What is it like to owe virtually your entire reputation as a writer to a single book? One thinks of J. D. Salinger, Ralph Ellison, Joseph Heller — to cite only the 20th-century American exemplars — but such one-book writers are legion in all literatures. John Carey seems to allude to the category in this biography’s subtitle (even though Carey eventually disputes the implication).

A hundred years doesn’t interest me. But 20 years interests me, and more for what happens to humans as opposed to things.” That’s the not-too-distant future Mr. Brooks will explore in “2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America,” a novel that St. Martin’s Press will publish in May 2011, the publisher announced on Friday. As St. Martin’s described the book in an e-mail message, “2030” takes place at a time when “a population that has finally been freed from the scourge of cancer is dramatically aging, sparking resentment against the ‘olds’ and leading to a nation so hamstrung by entitlements and debt that its only way out are solutions heretofore unthinkable.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/books/17arts-BROOKSTOTHEF_BRF.html

When asked whether CBS News nominated Mr. Halderman, a “48 Hours” spokesman said: “For more than two years, a team of journalists worked very hard on this important hour. The producers of ‘48 Hours’ felt that not to nominate their work would unfairly deprive the many other dedicated journalists involved of recognition they had earned.” Pleading guilty last March, Mr. Halderman admitted to having tried to extort $2 million from Mr. Letterman last year. The incident caused Mr. Letterman to tell his “Late Show” viewers about his affairs with female staff members.

In February 2008 a court in Ocala, Fla., sentenced him to three years in jail for willfully failing to file tax returns for 1999 to 2004. During that time he earned more than $38 million appearing in several movies, including two sequels to the popular vampire thriller “Blade.” In the appeal Mr. Snipes said that he should have been considered for probation and that the lower court should have allowed him to argue for a change of venue from Florida, where Mr. Snipes has a home, to New York, where he was born. The ruling did not specify where Mr. Snipes would be serving his sentence.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/19arts-SNIPESSAPPEA_BRF.html

2010-07-19,Joel Grey to Direct ‘Normal Heart’ Reading," Joel Grey, right, is to direct a staged reading of “Normal Heart,” the semi-autobiographical drama by Larry Kramer about the early years of the AIDS epidemic, to celebrate its 25th anniversary. The reading, presented by the producer Daryl Roth, is scheduled for Oct. 18 at the Walter Kerr Theater. Mr. Grey appeared in the 1985 production at the Public Theater, when he replaced Brad Davis as Ned, the activist based on Mr. Kramer. After seeing the show with Mr. Davis onstage, Mr. Grey said in a telephone interview, he told Mr. Kramer that “this is overwhelming and so devastating and important that I’ll never forget it.” He told Mr. Kramer he would love to step in if the role of Ned were to open up, and soon after he had his chance. “It was the most profound work experience,” Mr. Grey said. “Reading it again felt so fresh to me,” he added. “I was startled at all the issues that still remain 25 years later.” Mr. Grey directed a similar staged reading at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles in May, to raise money for an H.I.V./AIDS charity there. The New York reading will raise money for two organizations: the Actors Fund, which provides a range of services to people in the performing arts, and Friends in Deed, which supports people with H.I.V./AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses.

Part of the problem with meritocracy is that it homogenizes in the name of diversity: It skims the cream from every race and class and population, puts all of the best and brightest through the same educational conveyor belt, and comes out with a ruling class that’s cosmetically diverse but intellectually conformist, and that tends to huddle together rather than spreading out to enrich the country as a whole. This is Christopher Lasch’s lament in “The Revolt of the Elites” — that meritocracy co-opts people who might otherwise become its critics, sapping local communities of their intellectual vitality and preventing any kind of rival power centers from emerging. And it’s something that Angelo Codevilla gets right (while getting a number of other things wrong) in his recent blast against the American elite:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/the-trouble-with-meritocracy/

In January 2009, as Brandeis’s finances eroded, its trustees voted to “transition” the museum into a teaching center and gallery, followed by “an orderly sale or other disposition” of its works to raise money for the school. It backed off that plan and recently said it was working with Sotheby’s to make money by lending works from the collection or entering into partnerships with other institutions. “Atmospheric Conditions” will be replaced with an exhibition of the work of the Pop painter James Rosenquist, who told The Globe that he opposes sales from the collection but does not believe boycotting the Rose is the right strategy.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/arts/design/21arts-ARTISTSBOYCO_BRF.html

In the Senate, Democrats outperformed Republicans last month, raising $7 million compared with $4 million. Yet Democrats have only a slight edge in the amount of money on hand, with $22 million, compared with $20 million for Republicans. The financial edge, a bright spot for Democrats in a challenging environment, will allow the party to invest more in competitive races and begin television advertising earlier.

As a result, days before Snyder’s scheduled graduation, the university denied her a teaching degree. Snyder sued, arguing that the university had violated her First Amendment rights by penalizing her for her (perfectly legal) after-hours behavior.

Theater for a New Audience will also produce a “Macbeth” that will reunite the director Arin Arbus, right, and the actor John Douglas Thompson, below right, who enjoyed critical and audience praise for their 2009 production of “Othello.” Mr. Thompson played the title role in that production, as he will in “Macbeth,” which is scheduled to run from March 12 to April 22 at the Duke on 42nd Street. To start the season the theater company will present Yale Repertory Theater’s “Notes from Underground” at the Baryshnikov Arts Center’s Jerome Robbins Theater Nov. 7 to 20.

Michael Getler, the PBS ombudsman, has sided with the critics, writing in a column on Friday on PBS.org that the series suffered from “at least the appearance of a conflict of interest,” adding, “It doesn’t mean that funders exerted any editorial influence, but it left me feeling they didn’t have to.” The connections were listed in a review in The New York Times, and liberal media-monitoring groups like FAIR encouraged people to complain to PBS. Even before the first installment of the series, “Turmoil and Triumph,” had its debut on July 12, it was knocked by television critics for being too long and for treating its subject with reverence. Mr. Getler said he thought the “deification of Shultz” was unnecessary and distracting. PBS said in a statement that it believed the series “fully meets our standards for editorial integrity” and reiterated that “no PBS funder is permitted to exercise editorial control over content.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/arts/television/22arts-SHULTZPBSSER_BRF.html

Some cast mates discovered this year that they could earn tens of thousands of dollars through club appearances and other outside activities, and there were reports that they were holding up production while demanding big raises from MTV. It is unknown what price was agreed upon, but MTV wasted no time in confirming the deal after the Web site TMZ declared “peace in Seaside Heights,” the locale where the first season was filmed. “MTV is pleased that the Jersey Shore cast are returning to Seaside Heights to continue production on Season 3,” the network said in a statement. “Not only have they become a part of the MTV family, but fans worldwide have fallen in love with them.” MTV isn’t kidding about the “worldwide” part; the network has exported the series to dozens of countries.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/arts/television/22arts-JERSEYSHOREA_BRF.html

Daley Amory, the protagonist of Lily King’s third novel, “Father of the Rain,” confronts this question as she revisits the wealthy Boston suburb where she grew up in the 1970s, summoned to tend to her narcissistic father, a man who lives by the WASP code, circa 1952, in which martinis, filet mignon and brick-red pants are what matter and “to take something seriously is to be a fool.” At 29, Daley, an earnest Berkeley-bound anthropologist, yearns to fix her father’s life, so as to mend her own. But was his life broken, just because it broke hers?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

The documents have been the subject of a legal battle between the National Library in Israel and Eva Hoffe, who inherited the documents. Ms. Hoffe’s mother, Esther, was the secretary to Max Brod, a close friend of Kafka who served as executor of his estate after he died in 1924. Although Kafka requested that all his personal papers be burned, Brod, who immigrated to Israel in 1939, never complied. The District Family Court judge in Tel Aviv who heard the case ordered attorneys to prepare a detailed list of the contents of four boxes that had been stored in a Zurich bank and opened on Monday. Haaretz reported that a handwritten short story by Kafka, never before seen, is among the papers. Several more safe-deposit boxes with Kafka’s documents are also expected to be opened by the Tel Aviv court. The library contends that the Kafka papers are “cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people,” David Bloomberg, chairman of the National Library, said.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/books/23arts-UNSEENFRANZK_BRF.html

The project was put together by Company One, a resident company at the Boston Center for the Arts, and runs there through Aug. 14. Mr. Maguire, who has written more than two dozen novels for adults and children, including “Son of a Witch” and “Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,” said he was intrigued by the idea of seven men with a female child growing up in their midst. “Just because they were dwarfs doesn’t mean they were neutered,” Mr. Maguire said in an interview. “If they had more complexity, what would they make of the story?” The play is a more colloquial and action-packed version of his story by the same name, which appeared in the 2000 anthology “The Wolf at the Door,” a collection of reimagined fairy tales by a variety of writers. Company One approached Mr. Maguire to take part in the project. Among the other six playwrights in “Grimm” are Lydia R. Diamond (whose adaptation of Toni Morrison’s “Bluest Eye” has played around the country) and Marcus Gardley, one of the writers of “On the Levee,” which just finished a run at LCT3, Lincoln Center’s program for new directors and playwrights.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/theater/23arts-WICKEDNOVELI_BRF.html

On Thursday morning at Comic-Con, Middle Earth fans cheered an assurance that the “Hobbit” movies would not be in 3-D. Late in the afternoon, the snappy, snarly, anti 3-D thing was back. The crowd cheered when J. J. Abrams yelped “no!” to someone who asked if his “Super 8” would be in 3-D. Mr. Abrams, co-creator of “Lost” and director of the “Star Trek” reboot, said he is generally wary of 3-D. “When you put the glasses on, everything gets dimmer,” he complained.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/3-d-backlash-alive-and-well-at-comic-con/

Glaad also chided the network for failing to mention in a news release that Sara Gilbert, a co-host and executive on the as-yet-unnamed CBS talk show, has a lesbian partner, while it cited the husbands of the show’s other co-hosts. MTV earned Glaad’s highest rating, with 42 percent of its programming deemed inclusive, followed by CW (35 percent), Fox (30 percent), ABC (26 percent) and NBC (13 percent).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/arts/23arts-GLAADGIVESCB_BRF.html

Combining an even-tempered tone with generosity of imagination, she has achieved that goal, charting a steady course through the voluminous literature that the affair inspired and exploring the reactions of scores of soldiers, politicians, journalists, salonnières and ordinary citizens. A helpful “Dramatis Personae” at the end of the book lists nearly 150 people, all of whom are given substantial treatment during the course of the narrative.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/books/review/Damrosch-t.html

2010-07-26,Rival Studios Resolve Dispute Over ‘Precious’,"More than a year after the Lee Daniels film “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire” caught the attention of moviegoers  and two rival film studios  at the Sundance Film Festival, a lawyer for the Lionsgate studio said it had reached an agreement with the Weinstein Company and that a lawsuit involving the film’s rights has been dismissed, Reuters reported. In February 2009 Lionsgate announced that it had paid $5.5 million for the rights to “Precious,” which won the Grand Jury Prize at that year’s Sundance festival. The announcement came as a surprise to Harvey Weinstein, who said he believed that his company had already struck a deal to buy the film. The studios sued each other, and a portion of that suit filed by the Weinstein Company against the producers of “Precious” was dismissed in September 2009 after a judge said the company did not have a signed agreement for the transfer of film rights. Matthew Gershman, a lawyer for Lionsgate, told Reuters that its dispute with the Weinstein Company “was amicably resolved to both parties’ mutual satisfaction,” but did not give further details. “Precious” was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, for best supporting actress (Mo’Nique) and adapted screenplay (Geoffrey S. Fletcher).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/movies/24arts-RIVALSTUDIOS_BRF.html

This week, Ken Davenport, the president of Davenport Theatrical Enterprises and a producer of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions including “Oleanna” and “Altar Boyz,” introduced an iPhone app called At the Booth. The program, which is sold for 99 cents, says on its Web site (atthebooth.com) that it “lists all the Broadway and Off-Broadway shows available at the TKTS booth every day and at what price.” On Friday, Victoria Bailey, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, said in a statement that the fund was preparing its own iPhone application and was “concerned that this recently released app may not provide an accurate picture of ticket availability and line lengths considering the fluidity of both.” In a telephone interview Mr. Davenport declined to specify where the TKTS data provided by the At the Booth app comes from. “It’s not brain surgery,” he said.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/theater/24arts-TKTSONYOURIP_BRF.html

Mr. Hall, who also wrote the screenplay for the film version of “Billy Elliot,” told The Daily Mail that it took about two years to secure the rights for the project, and that it would probably take another two years before the musical is finished.

Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat of Vermont who is seeking re-election, plans to send a letter on Monday to the heads of those banks requesting the names and pay packages awarded to their top earners at the height of the crisis in late 2008. He also plans to ask them to reimburse the government for those payouts and to halt any future ones until the taxpayer money is returned. Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master for compensation, put the six companies on a list of 17 banks that he found made $1.6 billion of questionable payments to senior bankers in 2008 and early 2009. But he stopped short of demanding the money back, noting he did not have the legal authority. Mr. Welch said in an interview that he understood Mr. Feinberg had limited power to recoup the money but said Congress needed to take a tougher stance.

The semi-autobiographical work originally had trouble finding a publisher, as Eisner, who died in 2005,  wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1990: “It was, in format and style, as great a departure from the comic-book conventions as I could master. It was the story of one man’s perception of his relationship with God. The book was rejected by the major publishing houses but was ultimately published in 1978 by a small, now defunct publisher, Baronet Books, which got it into establishment bookstores. It got no reviews, neither was it an instant commercial success. The response from adults who chanced on it, however, was warm and encouraging. I had, at last, connected with a serious adult audience. Ultimately it acquired a word-of-mouth following and remains in print to this day.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/adapting-eisner-for-the-big-screen/

The monkeys were then taught to respond to a cue by choosing to look at one of two patterns.

As the monkeys were not deliberating, but rather reacting to visual stimuli, researchers were able to plausibly claim that the computer could successfully predict the monkeys’ reaction.

The reality was much less threatening than the rumor, if still scary: An argument between two men over a seat escalated until one of the men stabbed the other in the face with a pen, resulting in a minor cut “on or near the eyelid,” according to the San Diego police.

According to The Art Newspaper the surface of “Large Divided Oval: Butterfly” had suffered from pollution and vandalism. The work, above, could not be restored in situ, so it was sent to the Noack Foundry in Berlin, where it was originally cast. “Butterfly” was initially a loan to the city of West Berlin in 1986. (It had been placed in front of the Congress Hall as part of Berlin’s 750th anniversary in 1987.) At the time the city council wanted the sculpture permanently and wrote to Moore asking if he would donate it. But the letter arrived just before his death and went unanswered. In 1988 it was sold by the Henry Moore Foundation for nearly $2.6 million, then a huge price for a public sculpture.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/arts/design/26arts-BERLINGIVESF_BRF.html

Strong word of mouth, stellar reviews and hunger for original stories at the multiplex has fueled continued interest in the complicated film, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Ms. Jolie, starring as a C.I.A. officer in Columbia Pictures’ “Salt,” was second with about $35.6 million. That result proved Ms. Jolie to be one of the few remaining stars who can anchor a major Hollywood release. The animated film “Despicable Me” (Universal Pictures) powered forward in third place, selling about $24.1 million for a new domestic total of $161.7 million and solidifying its position as one of the breakout hits of the year. “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” a flop that will likely result in a write-down at Walt Disney Studios, was fourth in its second weekend with $9.7 million ($42.6 million total). Disney-Pixar’s “Toy Story 3” rounded out the top five with $9 million ($379.5 million total).

2010-07-27,Oliver Stone Controversy,"Oliver Stone found himself the catalyst of an online brush fire on Monday after he made comments published in The Sunday Times of London that were interpreted as anti-Semitic. In an interview with The Times to promote his documentary “South of the Border,” which is about South American politics, Mr. Stone defended Hitler. “Hitler was a Frankenstein, but there was also a Dr. Frankenstein,” he said. “German industrialists, the Americans and the British. He had a lot of support. Hitler did far more damage to the Russians than the Jewish people.” Mr. Stone then proceeded to discuss what he called “the Jewish domination of the media,” adding with an expletive that Israel had messed up “United States foreign policy for years.” Bloggers quickly picked up on the comments, and the American Jewish Committee issued a news release condemning him. “By invoking this grotesque, toxic stereotype, Oliver Stone has outed himself as an anti-Semite,” the committee’s executive director, David Harris, said in the release. Mr. Stone, whose next Hollywood movie, “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” will be released by 20th Century Fox on Sept. 24, has stirred controversy with his comments in this arena before. In January the director told a gathering of television critics that “Hitler is an easy scapegoat” while discussing his Showtime nonfiction mini-series, “Secret History of America.” At that time the Simon Wiesenthal Center harshly rebuked him for the remarks. A spokesman for Mr. Stone was not immediately available to comment.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/movies/27arts-OLIVERSTONEC_BRF.html

And I hope it works well for her elsewhere.” Mr. Shear declined to comment on a report on Deadline.com that Ms. Evanovich had sought $50 million as an advance for her next four novels. Random House said on Monday that Ms. Evanovich had jumped to its Ballantine Bantam Dell imprint; it acquired the world rights to four new novels, including two Stephanie Plum tales and two in Ms. Evanovich’s “Unmentionable” series. Random House declined to disclose the financial terms of the contract. Ms. Evanovich has been with St. Martin’s Press since the publication of “Four to Score,” the fourth novel in her Stephanie Plum series, in 1998.

It will be taped on Wednesday. Mr. Obama’s chat with the unpredictable co-hosts, including the staunch liberal Joy Behar and the equally staunch conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck, is emblematic of his administration’s outreach to unconventional media outlets. “Given the difficulty of reaching people in this hyperactive media environment, we look for opportunities to reach people in environments that are not traditional forums for political newsmakers,” Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said in an e-mail message. “That’s why we have been willing to have the president on Leno, Letterman and ESPN.” Mr. Pfeiffer said an appearance on “The View” had been contemplated for several weeks because the president was scheduled to be in New York City for a fund-raiser.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/arts/television/27arts-OBAMATOAPPEA_BRF.html

Not on that roster, however, was Jessica Biel, the “7th Heaven” and “A-Team” star, who was thought to be headed for a starring role, according to reports in the spring. A representative for the theater company said on Monday that Ms. Biel would not be in the cast, and that additional casting would be announced in the weeks ahead.

2010-07-27,Authors Guild Weighs In On E-Books,"Last week it was the big book publisher and the big literary agent who sparred over who gets to make e-books out of titles that were published before there were such things. Now the Authors Guild has weighed in. In a letter to its members on Monday, the Guild said that publishers were largely to blame for the dispute between Random House and the literary agent Andrew Wylie, which came to a head last week when Mr. Wylie announced that he would begin his own venture to sell e-book rights for older books directly to Amazon, bypassing traditional publishers that have already released the books in print and have staked a claim to the e-book rights as well. Random House responded on Thursday by saying it would not do business with the Wylie Agency until the situation was resolved. The Guild estimated that the authors represented by Mr. Wylie in the e-books deal with Amazon would make three times the amount in royalties than traditional publishers were offering.

The remarks, which included a reference to “the Jewish domination of the media” and a remark that “Hitler did far more damage to the Russians than the Jewish people,” were criticized by Jewish groups as anti-Semitic. “In trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret,” Mr. Stone said in a statement. “Jews obviously do not control media or any other industry. The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity  and it was an atrocity.” Mr. Stone had made the comments during an interview with the London newspaper to promote his documentary “South of the Border,” which is about South American politics.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/movies/28arts-OLIVERSTONEA_BRF.html

The lawsuit, filed on Monday in Manhattan, argues that the producers did not seek or have the permission of the photographer, Marilyn Nance, to use the image of the nightclub, known as the Shrine, in a projection shown during the musical. Ms. Nance’s lawyer, Edward C. Greenberg, said in an interview that the image is used during 40 percent of the show (with Sahr Ngaujah, above) and is rendered in a “Fela!” souvenir book. A spokesman for the production, Richard Kornberg, disputed that the image was displayed for 40 percent of the show, saying it was “far less than that.” He also said the projection was only a fragment of a photograph. Mr. Kornberg said that the producers had been unaware that the photograph was taken by Ms. Nance and that she had a copyright on it, and said the photo would be replaced by Thursday. He also noted that Ms. Nance did not seek copyright protection for the photograph until seeing the show on Broadway.

2010-07-29,‘Ring’ Set Is Rolled In at the Met,"The leviathan has landed. The 45-ton set (part of it, above) for the Metropolitan Opera’s new Wagner “Ring” cycle created by Robert Lepage has arrived at the house. On Wednesday it passed a key test when it was rolled from a wing onto center stage. The trial run was delayed by several hours when an inspecting engineer found that the metal structure under the stage needed some touch-up welding. Last spring the Met installed massive steel girders to support the part of the stage in the wing where the set will be stored between performances. Recently arrived from a warehouse outside Montreal, the set consists of two 26-foot towers that bear an axis on which planks can seesaw up and down into various configurations. The axis can rise and fall. A platform in front of the plank structure will be the site of 90 percent of the action, the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, said. The sound of the hydraulic machinery used to reconfigure the set could be heard several levels below. John Sellars, the Met’s assistant manager for technical issues, said the machinery would be soundproofed. Mr. Lepage’s concept revolves around sophisticated computer-driven projections, or “virtual scenery,” that will be cast onto the planks. “Das Rheingold,” the cycle’s first opera, is scheduled for the season’s opening night, Sept. 27.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/arts/music/29arts-RINGSETISROL_BRF.html

2010-07-29,He’s Like a Rainbow: A Ronnie Wood Art Show,"They may be only the paintings and other artworks created by a well-known rock ’n’ roll guitarist, but the Butler Institute of American Art likes them  enough to give Ronnie Wood, above, of the Rolling Stones, an eight-week exhibition there that the museum says is the first American show of Mr. Wood’s art. The institute, in Youngstown, Ohio, plans to present the exhibition, “Ronnie Wood: Paintings, Drawings and Prints,” from Sept. 21 to Nov. 21. It will feature about 60 works by Mr. Wood, who also played with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces before joining the Stones. In a telephone interview, Louis A. Zona, executive director of the Butler Institute, said the show was the culmination of more than four years spent trying to persuade Mr. Wood to exhibit his work there. He added that what impressed him about Mr. Wood’s work, which tends to depict his rock ’n’ roll colleagues, including Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, was not the celebrity of the man who created them but the quality of the art. “He has done a number of cartoons,” Dr. Zona said of Mr. Wood, “spoofs on English culture, and they look like they were done by Daumier, just wonderful things.

Iran is the world’s fifth-largest exporter of crude oil, but a lack of refining capacity forces it to import about 30 percent of its gasoline. The plan to increase production was announced by the oil minister, Masoud Mirkazemi, who predicted that Iran would become a net exporter of gasoline by 2015. Benzene, a product derived from natural gas, can be further processed to produce gasoline for use in cars and other vehicles. Experts said, however, that the product would burn poorly and contain more impurities than regular gasoline, causing damage to engines.

A raft of luxurious boutiques and restaurants has opened. Beloved old hotels and barrooms have been renovated.

You get used to them here. You have to. The six scientists from the American Museum of Natural History, at this field station for two weeks to study sea turtles, regularly see at least 10 sharks, and sometimes we see 40 to 50 in a day if we concentrate. I am particularly fond of the shark pups – the size of my forearm or so – but the often-curious larger sharks (black tips in the shallow flats as well as Galapagos sharks on the deeper dives) can be a bit disconcerting, especially if you are concentrating on something else and only notice them as they swim past for a closer look. Other scientists have had close encounters with tiger sharks, but I have not yet seen them. I just see evidence of them on the turtles. When we are checking turtles over in the health analyses, we see healed wounds that make me crazy trying to figure out how the turtles survived. In some, the shell looks like a cookie with a bite out of it.",Science,https://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/why-so-many-predators/

Arguing that the varieties of yogic experience in America can “leave you metaphorically standing on your head,” a recent article in The Hindustan Times noted there are now such things as circus yoga, nude yoga, pre- and postnatal yoga, acro yoga (acrobatics), Christian yoga, hip-hop yoga, even yoga for dogs (“doga”).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/books/30book.html

And since the early 1970s the narrow waterway has been the centerpiece of a 70-mile-long state park popular with bikers, walkers, fishermen and boaters.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/nyregion/30canal.html

The battle over its ownership was finally resolved last week when the Leopold Museum in Vienna agreed to pay $19 million to the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray, a Jewish gallery owner in Vienna, from whom the work, “Portrait of Wally,” was seized by a Nazi agent in 1938. In 1997 the painting was lent to the Museum of Modern Art for an exhibition of Schiele paintings and subpoenaed by the Manhattan district attorney’s office amid claims that it did not rightfully belong to the Leopold, whose founder acquired it in 1954. The painting was eventually seized by the United States government.

If you’re Mr. West, you release a music video teeming with debauchery, degradation and the specter of death.

As he raps, the camera slowly zooms out in one continuous, unedited take to reveal him in a classical structure, surrounded by female attendants partly or entirely nude; some kneel before him on all fours, others wear devil horns and others are suspended upside down from the ceiling. The sword of Damocles hangs over Mr. West’s head, and behind him an unseen executioner is preparing to strike him with a blade. In a telephone interview, Mr. Brambilla explained that he was drawn to the project because, he said, “it’s kind of apocalyptic, in a very personal way.” The video is to be posted on Mr. West’s Web site sometime next week, Mr. Brambilla said, and will be provided to MTV and other music channels.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/arts/music/30arts-APERSONALAPO_BRF.html

Of course, when a book is this satisfying, it probably doesn’t matter what we call it, only that we have it, although in this case, sadly, we’ll never have another. Jensen died of cancer in 2003, before any of her stories made it into print.

Some went shopping for exquisite silver, fashionable furniture and the latest books; others traded their goods and engaged in political arguments in noisy coffee houses.

2010-07-30,Stray Questions for: Jennifer Egan,"Jennifer Egan is the author of five works of fiction, most recently “A Visit From the Goon Squad.”In your new book, the term “Goon Squad” refers to the passage of time. When Ringo Starr turned 70 recently, he told The Times that he still feels 24 inside. How old do you feel inside, and how do you think the passage of time affects our core identities?My mom used to say that if someone woke her up in the middle of the night and asked how old she was, she’d answer 27. Hearing her, I’d think: That’s ridiculous; your job as my mom is to be old. Now, in my mid-40s, I find that I identify with people even younger than that — teenagers! If I had to pick one age, it would probably be 17: that period of looking like an adult but not quite being one, of pretending to be “yourself” (whoever that is) and praying that people will believe you; of having wild hopes about what kind of life you might have but also fearing you’ll never make it out of the house — all of that still feels so immediate. Sometimes I’ll watch teenagers and find myself not quite believing I’m older than they are — even wondering, delusionally, if they can see any difference between us. And yet my own kids will be teenagers soon, and when I talk to actual teens I’m vividly aware, of course, that they’re children.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/stray-questions-for-jennifer-egan/

They move gracefully back and forth between different places and different — often impossibly distant — times.

2010-07-30,Yesterday’s Banker,"The last couple of years have not been good for the reputation of bankers. When their ludicrous bets on American mortgages went bad in 2007 and 2008, bringing the whole financial industry to the brink of disaster, they looked like fools; and their behavior since has only cast them in an even worse light. Their uncanny knack for extracting gigantic profits from the current low interest rates, when the rest of the economy is struggling, raises the suspicion that there is something exploitative about what they do, a fear exacerbated by the startling bonuses they continue to pay themselves through good times and bad. Perhaps most disturbing is that, in their public appearances, the men who run the big financial institutions in this country and wield such enormous power seem to display so shallow and unreflective a worldview.

Perhaps that’s because, for all his scholarly use of multiple musical styles and his references to Yeats and Joyce, the Belfast Cowboy’s work is more sensual than it is intellectual. Which makes the renowned rock critic Greil Marcus, who’s written definitively on Elvis and Bob Dylan, the right man to plumb that work. Combining an incantatory prose style with careful reporting and inventive, sometimes infuriating judgments, Marcus manages to illuminate Morrison’s cerebral soul music — even if, as the singer once claimed, “the process is beyond words.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/books/review/Gerstenzang-t.html

This is no metaphor, she explains in “A South African Childhood,” the first essay in “Telling Times,” a big new collection of her nonfiction. The gold-mining town that was her birthplace, in the Transvaal region east of Johannesburg, was dotted with man-made hills of coal dust, the relics of old collieries. Some of them, she writes, mimicked natural hills: “real earth had blown on to them to hold a growth of sparse grass and perhaps even a sinewy peppercorn or peach tree.” But inside, they were burning: “They had caught fire at some time or other in their years of disuse, and had continued to burn, night and day, ever since. Neither rain nor time could put the fires out. . . . I have asked people who have studied such things how long it may be expected to go on burning before it consumes itself. Nobody seems to know; it shares with the idea of Hades its heat and vague eternity.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/books/review/Kirsch-t.html

But across the Potomac, next to Congressional Cemetery, rises a more fitting tribute to the “war on drugs”: Washington’s city jail, through which 18,000 inmates pass each year, 89 percent of them black and three-quarters of them incarcerated for nonviolent of­fenses.

It also features Felicity Jones as her daughter, Miranda; Ben Whishaw as Ariel; Djimon Hounsou as Caliban; Alfred Molina as Stephano; Alan Cumming as Sebastian; Chris Cooper as Antonio; David Strathairn as Alonso; and Russell Brand as Trinculo.

(Although they might not have been so thrilled Friday afternoon after seeing reports that one of the show’s stars, Nicole Polizzi, known as Snooki, had been arrested in Seaside Heights, N.J., and accused of disorderly conduct.) The premiere of the second season of “Jersey Shore” attracted 5.3 million viewers on Thursday night, according to Nielsen, the network’s biggest season premiere in more than seven years. The series about young people partying at the beach — it’s really that simple — was a sensation last winter for MTV, peaking at 4.8 million viewers for the finale.

2010-08-02,Case Study | Bachelor’s Jam,"Sometimes an idea comes along that’s so elementally brilliant I feel no compunction about stealing it outright. That’s what I thought I was doing with this recipe when a friend told me he’d read it in the new “River Cottage Preserves Handbook,” written by Pam Corbin. It’s called bachelor’s jam, or sometimes officer’s jam, and it isn’t jam at all but rather a whip-smart method of both preserving the overflow of ripening summer fruit and infusing spirits with the same in a manner befitting, well, a bachelor and/or an officer. This makes for a “preserve” that comes into its own just in time to bring a welcome hit of summer fruit to the holidays. Once I started digging and found that the chef Roger Vergé has written on what is known as confiture de vieux garçon, and that it is also an old and well-loved treat in Germany (known as rumtopf, or “rum pot”), I felt a bit less guilty about my plagiarism.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/case-study-bachelors-jam/

2010-08-02,‘A Terrible Parricide’,"In this Sunday’s Book Review, Thomas Mallon reviews Geoffrey O’Brien’s “Fall of the House of Walworth,” about a sensational parricide in an old and influential family in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1873 — sensational enough, in fact, to merit O’Brien’s subtitle: “A Tale of Madness and Murder in Gilded Age America.” In the case, the deranged novelist Mansfield Tracy Walworth, largely forgotten now, but of some note in his own day, was shot to death by his son, Frank, in a Manhattan hotel room; Frank’s motivation, it seems, was his father’s brutal treatment of his mother, Ellen Walworth, one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Mallon has high praise for O’Brien’s “crackerjack new history,” and you should certainly read his elegant review first. But if we do say so, The New York Times’s anonymous account on June 4, 1873, the day after the killing, is a surprisingly moving piece of journalism as well, full of passion and personal interest, a crackerjack little melodrama; such is the startling story, headlined “A Terrible Parricide”:",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/a-terrible-parricide/

Ms. Bullock, a New Orleans resident, is among the celebrities who appear in “Be the One,” a video that describes the oil spill’s national implications. A credit at the end of the video says it is presented by Women of the Storm, and among the partners listed at the campaign’s Web site, restorethegulf.com, is the America’s Wetland Foundation. Prompted by a report by The Huffington Post that said Women of the Storm and the foundation were financed by oil companies, including BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Citgo and Chevron, Ms. Bullock said she would seek to be removed from the campaign. In a statement reported by the Web site ThinkProgress.org, a publicist for Ms. Bullock wrote: “At no time was she made aware that any organization, oil company or otherwise had influence over Women of the Storm or its message. We have immediately asked for her participation in the P.S.A. be removed until the facts can be determined.” Officials for the America’s Wetland Foundation told The Huffington Post that the contributions it received from the oil companies were for scientific and ecological research.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/movies/31arts-BULLOCKWANTS_BRF.html

The series about young people partying at the beach  it’s really that simple  was a sensation last winter for MTV, peaking at 4.8 million viewers for the finale.
