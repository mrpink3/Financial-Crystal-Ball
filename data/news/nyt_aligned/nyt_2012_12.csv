The case, which pits health concerns against the need to protect 20,000 jobs in heavy industry, has tested the government of Prime Minister Mario Monti, which estimated that the economy would suffer losses of $10.4 billion a year if the plant closed. Mr. Monti, above, said the government needed to safeguard both public health and jobs as the plant carried out its cleanup. On Monday a court ordered the seizure of parts of the plant as a criminal investigation looked into claims of environmental damages caused by the plant’s emissions. Some studies have found that cancer rates around the steel plant, Europe’s largest, are significantly higher than elsewhere in Italy. Ilva had said that the investigation would force it to close the plant. An independent monitor will supervise Ilva’s plan to improve its technology.

2012-12-03,What’s on Monday,"8 P.M. (TCM) BABY PEGGY, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM (2012) Peggy-Jean Montgomery, left, a daughter of a professional cowboy turned stuntman who moved his family to Hollywood, was 19 months old when she captured the attention of the director Fred Fishbach. Impressed by her plucky demeanor and good behavior, he cast her in some of Century Studios’ comedy shorts, sometimes opposite Brownie the Wonder Dog. As the third great child star of the silent era, after Baby Marie and Jackie Coogan, Peggy made about 150 shorts in all, working eight-hour days, six days a week, and performing stunts like being held underwater and escaping a burning building. In 1923 she earned the nickname Million-Dollar Baby when Universal lured her away from Century with the chance to make feature films for $1.5 million annually. But soon her father and the producer Sol Lesser argued about her salary, and Lesser not only fired her but also blackballed her in Hollywood. By the age of 11 Baby Peggy was a has-been. When she reached adulthood, she discovered that her family had spent her earnings — more than $2 million. Calling herself Diana Serra Cary, Peggy became an author and film historian as well as an advocate for laws protecting child actors. This tribute begins with Vera Iwerebor’s documentary, filmed shortly before the actress’s 90th birthday in 2008. It is followed by “Captain January” (1924), a silent feature about a lighthouse keeper (Hobart Bosworth) who raises a child found washed ashore in a ship’s wreckage, at 9; and three of her few remaining shorts: “Carmen, Jr.” (1923), a spoof on Bizet’s “Carmen” and the tango, at 10:15; “Such Is Life” (1924), loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s “Little Match Girl,” at 10:30; and “Peg o’ the Mounted” (1924), about a pint-size Mountie who hunts down a gang of moonshiners, led by a giant of a man played by Jack Earle, who stood roughly 7 feet 7 inches.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2012-12-04,Mars Rover Finds No Signs of Life in Dirt,"NASA said Monday that its Mars rover Curiosity had analyzed a Martian sand drift, but — alas — had not found signs of the building blocks of life. At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, scientists said the mineralogical composition was similar to what was found by the earlier Spirit and Opportunity rovers elsewhere on Mars. An instrument, Sample Analysis at Mars, or Sam for short, looked at the gases that escaped as it heated the dirt to nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The most common gases were water vapor and carbon dioxide. The Sam instrument also detected chlorinated methane — a small, simple compound that falls in the category of organics, which are the building blocks of life. But the scientists said it was too early to say that the soil itself contained organics. The carbon could be vestiges of molecules that the spacecraft brought from Earth, and the organics could have been generated by chemical reactions as the dirt was heated. Whether the carbon could point to anything biological, “that’s well down the road for us to get to,” said John P. Grotzinger, the mission’s project scientist.

2012-12-04,"11 Miles a Second, but Still in the Solar System","The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched 35 years ago to explore Jupiter and other planets, has not yet left the confines of the solar system for interstellar space — but it is getting close, scientists said Monday. The spacecraft, which is more than 11 billion miles from Earth, has entered a “magnetic highway,” a new region of crisscrossing charged particles, some from the Sun and some from interstellar space. But researchers, speaking at a news briefing in Pasadena, Calif., said there was no indication of a change in the magnetic field that would indicate that Voyager had entered interstellar space itself. Edward Stone, a Voyager project scientist, said this new region may be the last layer before interstellar space, but it could take the spacecraft another two or three years to cross it. Voyager 1 is traveling about 11 miles a second; a companion craft, Voyager 2, is not quite as far from the Sun and is traveling slower, less than 10 miles a second.

2012-12-05,France: Two Suspects Detained in Toulouse Killings," The police detained a man and a woman in southern France on Tuesday on suspicion of abetting the killing of seven people in Toulouse last March, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Investigators believe that the man may have been involved in providing firearms to the gunman, Mohammed Merah, according to the prosecutor’s spokeswoman, Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre. The man is also suspected of participating in the theft of the stolen motor scooter Mr. Merah used in the killings, she said, while the woman was detained because she was the man’s former partner. No charges had been filed against either.

2012-12-05,What’s On Wednesday,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY (2001) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, above, wrote, directed and starred in this drama about a Los Angeles couple’s sixth-anniversary party, and official reunion after a separation, which runs amok. She, Sally, is a 30-something movie star who may soon be washed up; he, Joe, is a British writer whose novel about their troubled marriage is about to be made into a film. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the $4-million-a-movie actress who is supposed to play a character based on Sally and brings along a batch of Ecstasy to the festivities. Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, Jane Adams, John C. Reilly, John Benjamin Hickey and Parker Posey fill out the cast. “An articulate, acutely observant film like ‘The Anniversary Party’ makes you realize how starved Hollywood movies are for great ensemble acting,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “In probing its characters’ souls, ‘The Anniversary Party’ goes only so far. This isn’t Chekhov, by any stretch of the imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn’t all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and that’s saying a lot.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

I thought I could do something with my own history where the final result would be pretty far away from art.” For the uninitiated, it’s worth noting that Prince has used plastic six-pack holders as source material in various sculptural work since the 1990s.

This was a man-bites-man story that also turned out to be a man-freaks-out-about-women story. In a long narrative uploaded in November by Roger Ebert on The Chicago Sun-Times’s Web site, Calleri quoted an e-mail from his boss, Frank Parlato (curiously unnamed in the article), who had recently taken over as editor and publisher of The Reporter. Parlato was not, to put it mildly, a fan of Calleri’s movie reviews, but his real problem was with the movies themselves. “I don’t want to publish reviews of films where women are alpha and men are beta,” he wrote. “Where women are heroes and villains and men are just lesser versions or shadows of females.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/magazine/hollywoods-year-of-heroine-worship.html

This sketchy group biography could not have a better title, but Mr. Gottlieb takes an oddly equivocal position toward his material. On the one hand, the famously unhappy union between Dickens and Catherine Hogarth — who was cast off bitterly by her husband after she bore 10 children and experienced several miscarriages, all in a period of 15 years — makes him think of his own parents’ marriage. On the other, he is a father who identifies with Dickens and can “sympathize to a certain extent with his frustrations.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/books/robert-gottliebs-book-on-dickens-and-his-children.html

The essay is well worth reading in full, both for its analysis and its policy prescriptions: Kenworthy ranges across marriage promotion, the child tax credit, education costs, mass incarceration, and class-based affirmative action, offering a more left-of-center (that is, somewhat more goverment-centric and free-spending) alternative to the pro-family, “Party of Sam’s Club” populism that certain writers have been urging on the Republican Party unsuccessfully for some time.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/a-liberal-take-on-family-and-opportunity/

The government declared a public health emergency after a shipping container from China carrying a pesticide caught fire at a Buenos Aires port, sending a thick, foul-smelling cloud of smoke over several parts of the city. An emergency official recommended that people living near the site of the fire “avoid going out” and “close doors and windows.” A laboratory analysis identified the active ingredient in the pesticide as thiodicarb, classified as “moderately hazardous” by the World Health Organization in 2009. Sergio Berni, the security secretary, said a sample of the pesticide was “of low toxicity” and posed little risk.

Mr. Markin said the attack appeared to be “a warning to other journalists” who were involved in news coverage about the government’s campaign against insurgents. President Vladimir V.

The new five-member board will oversee management of the 64,000-student district, which has been struggling to rebuild after administrators inflated test scores in struggling schools by pushing low-performing students out of the classroom and, in some cases, out of school altogether. The agency had previously sanctioned the district by lowering its accreditation status for reporting fraudulent data and allowing the misconduct to flourish. The replacement of the elected trustees must be approved by the federal Department of Justice. A state education official will oversee the district’s operations until the board of managers is installed.

2012-12-07,What’s On Friday,"8:15 P.M. (Cinemax) WANDERLUST (2012) Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, above, star as Linda and George, out-of-work Manhattanites unable to sell their “microloft” in the West Village. They stumble onto Elysium, an “intentional community” in rural Georgia, where good vibrations — and not a little smoke — fill the air, and the only blackberries grow on trees. Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely, guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario. The group includes another New York dropout (Malin Akerman) and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he’s crushing grapes for homemade wine. “Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this “mostly funny comedy” from David Wain. “Linda and George don’t burn with the yearning to travel that the title suggests, yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There’s something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn’t let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long.” Instead, she said, “the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and, with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudd’s help, they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michaela Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up, but ‘Bridesmaids’ notwithstanding, the women’s liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2012-12-07,Memo From Miami | The Cuban Connection,"Earlier this year, the TED-prize-winning photographer and street artist JR was invited to develop a project for the Havana Biennial; he invited the painter José Parlá, a friend and a first-generation Miami-born Cuban-American, to collaborate. Embarking on another iteration of JR’s Wrinkles of the City project — which had previously focused on Shanghai, Los Angeles and Cartagena — Parlá and JR photographed and interviewed 25 of Havana’s oldest residents. Two months later, they wheat-pasted oversize images of the subjects’ faces on the distressed walls of the city, accented with Parlá’s calligraphic words and painting. To celebrate the completion of this project and an accompanying book and short film, Parlá conceived a pop-up Cuban “cafécito” at Andre Balazs’s Standard Spa, to run during Art Basel Miami Beach week, operated by Miami’s beloved Cuban restaurant David’s Café. The artist constructed the 24-hour Cafecito Neptuno — complete with a walk-up order window, psychedelically patterned tiles and aqua counters — named for the busy thoroughfare in Havana. On Saturday the duo will screen their 26-minute documentary; a short excerpt from the film appears above. The Moment sat down with JR and Parlá to discuss the project.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/memo-from-miami-the-cuban-connection/

A generation of designers working in architecture, advertising, packaging, interior design, graphic and scenic design came to believe that commonplace goods and appliances, from automobiles to pencil sharpeners, could benefit from contemporary veneers — and some serious retooling.

Across the English Channel, on the battlefields and in the trenches of Flanders and France, Joey and Albert endure parallel experiences, including harrowing escapes, the loss of friends, terror and deprivation. Peter Mullan and Emily Watson play Albert’s parents, and David Thewlis is their landlord in this story written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo. “Like most movies with an antiwar message, ‘War Horse’ cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “  ‘The war has taken everything from everyone’ — the truth of this reckoning, uttered more than once by characters on screen, is self-evident, but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience.” Still, “The extreme violence of the slaughter in World War I is implied rather than graphically depicted,” he added. “Mr. Spielberg steps back from the bloody, chaotic naturalism of ‘Saving Private Ryan’ — this is an animal fable for children, after all, with echoes of ‘E. T.’ and Carroll Ballard’s ‘Black Stallion’ — but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Nearby, but easily obscured by the acres of primary-color plastic, was a booth for a company called Fat Brain Toys, whose games and puzzles in logic and sequencing came with an impressive lineage, some of them designed by the celebrated inventor Ivan Moscovich, a Holocaust survivor.

That partnership’s pop-preppy shoes were an instant hit, achieving cult status among dandy-cool fashion folk — a pair of the spectator wingtips with neon pink soles are currently on eBay for almost four times their original retail price. Which is precisely why the latest shoe from this collaboration — a loafer with a white Lunarlon sole — is so exciting. “We wanted to explore a modern yet authentic reimagination of this iconic style,” says Gareth Lewis, Cole Haan’s men’s footwear design director. Completing this new series, which will be available tomorrow, are two spectator-like wingtips in brown and white with a neon orange sole or black and white with black sole. “It’s a subtle but bold reinterpretation of a timeless classic,” Lewis adds.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/feeling-for-cole-haan-and-fragment-designs-lunargrand-loafer/

But instead of sticking only to cheeses made nearby, as tradition dictates, he brings them in from elsewhere, often the high Dolomites. They may be coated with olive oil and ashes or wrapped in walnut leaves. Or he might enclose them in hay, chestnut leaves or even crushed blackberries or beeswax. Each of his cheeses has a different aroma, flavor and texture but offers a balance of richness and acidity. A new one, a majestic cylinder wrapped in hay, leaves and mushrooms and called Merlino, was an experiment that has made him very happy.

By specifically excluding Anglicans, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron appeared to have taken a major step back from a change that gay and lesbian groups have hailed as a watershed. Maria Miller, the culture minister, said the aim was to guarantee the Anglican churches that they could not be forced to hold same-sex marriages if litigants went to British and European courts demanding the rights that members of other faiths would enjoy. That possibility helped opponents of the change muster support from a substantial bloc of Conservative lawmakers.

And no one seems to feel this sentiment as acutely as the whiskey aficionados and connoisseurs who belong to London’s new Soho Whisky Club. Besides its fabulous whiskey, the club’s finest quality is its semisecret location in a lofty annex above one of London’s oldest and finest single-malt retailers, the Vintage House on Old Compton Street. This downstairs shop carries over 1,800 pours and is the envy of single-malt collectors, offering hard-to-find tipples like a 70-year-old Mortlach (just $30,400). The attitude of the upstairs whiskey club seems to be along the lines of: Why read a description of our whiskies when you can have them in a glass? And for a $320 annual membership fee, members enjoy privacy, free monthly tastings and a choice from over 300 single malts, from the delightfully drinkable to the rare reserves. Among the special 2012 bottles the club currently recommends are the Port Ellen 32 year old ($956), a peppery pour with an almost muddy coal finish, and Auchroisk 30 year ($367), which tastes of banana, charred fruitcake and orange peel.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/in-london-a-sanctum-for-single-malts/

As politicians left and right try to hammer out a plan to keep the country afloat, the Parthenon still crowns the Acropolis like, in the words of an ancient Turkish traveler, “some impregnable fortress not made by human agency.” And if there is more commotion in Syntagma Square than usual, overall Athens is noisily going about being Athens — cafes are full, night life is roaring and at a recent concert by the singer Anna Vissi fans were flinging 10-euro trays of carnations at the star by the hundreds. Best of all, those undeterred by fiscal follies can probably get more value for their euro here than in any other big European city right now. Consider that a room at the posh New Hotel, by Syntagma Square, is going for slightly more than 100 euros a night, and includes the kind of gourmet breakfast that draws local dealmakers and diplomats alike. That kind of value, along with refreshingly drama-free winter weather, turns the idea of visiting into an imperative.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/acropolis-now/

A new Senate report on C.I.A. interrogations, which has been criticized by the Republican minority, has found that brutal treatment was not “a central component” in finding Bin Laden; the film’s screenwriter, Mark Boal, explained that he was “to compress a program that lasted for years into a few short scenes.” Those scenes, he said, attempted “to reflect a very complex debate about torture that is still going on” and showed that brutal treatment produced both true and false information.",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/the-breakfast-meeting-debating-torture-in-zero-dark-thirty-and-a-food-blogger-breaks-out/

His elephants even hauled timber for the John Ringling Causeway, which links the mainland to Lido Key.

This is not a possibility, not a likely scenario, not a maybe or a might be; it’s just reality, conceded even by the notorious RINO Jim DeMint. Which means that it’s useful for analytic purposes to treat that $800 billion as a baseline, rather than as a live point of give and take in the negotiations, and recognize that any bigger deal John Boehner and Barack Obama are able to cut should be judged as much on how it balances spending cuts and tax increases beyond that baseline as on what it looks like overall.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/simplifying-the-fiscal-cliff-debate/

And where a lot of critics aim for impartial assessment, he has unapologetically privileged his private passions. Today, Thomson is best known for his “New Biographical Dictionary of Film,” but his strength is less taxonomy than transition, the almost cinematic way his mind cuts among its intellectual frames.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/books/review/the-big-screen-by-david-thomson.html

The Treasury Department said the sanctions were intended to deter the procurement operations of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, which is led by Dr. Abbasi; the Iran Centrifuge Technology Company; and Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Companies and people on the blacklist cannot do business with any American businesses or citizens, and any assets they may have in the United States will be frozen. The new sanctions, which came as a team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency was visiting Iran, were likely to anger Iranian officials, who have repeatedly rejected Western and Israeli accusations that their nuclear program is a cover to develop the ability to make atomic weapons.

2012-12-14,What’s On Friday,"9 P.M. (Sundance) RESTLESS In the conclusion of this two-part drama written by William Boyd, Ruth Gilmartin (Michelle Dockery), a Cambridge graduate student in 1970s England, continues to uncover the past of her mother, Sally (Charlotte Rampling, above), who she has recently discovered is actually Eva Delectorskaya (Hayley Atwell plays the young Eva), a Russian exile who worked as a British spy during World War II. Now the former spy thinks someone is out to kill her, which is why she’s buying a rifle and ammunition strong enough to take down a charging elephant. “We all have secrets,” she admonishes her disbelieving daughter. “No one even knows half the truth about someone else.” Rufus Sewell and Michael Gambon share the role of Lucas Romer, a spymaster and Sally’s former lover, who may be the only one who can save her. “Devout fans of the British espionage thriller or the British cozy mystery may find themselves perfectly happy with ‘Restless,’ ” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Boyd’s understated script is free of hackneyed dialogue or florid emotion (no surprise), and there are niceties of language — strategically repeated phrases, Ruth’s wavering forms of address to her mother — that you don’t expect in a mini-series. And Ms. Dockery and Ms. Rampling, in their relatively short screen time together, have an astringent rapport that brings to life the complicated relationship of Ruth and Eva, as well as Mr. Boyd’s themes of the forging and cracking of identity under pressure, in a way that goes beyond words on a page.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

He quickly seduced the city’s frequently Francophile establishment, and, more important, tutored them in Gallic gastronomy like a stern but conditionally charming headmaster.

2012-12-14,At the Panel’s Edge,"Ellen Forney’s greatest strength as a cartoonist is her gift for explanation — getting information across with vigor, wit and visual inventiveness. That inspiration may have come at an awful cost, she suggests in MARBLES: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo, and Me (Gotham, paper, $20), a memoir of her long tango, or wrestling match, with bipolar disorder. As she explains, her frantic, volatile high moods seemed to fuel her art; her crushing lows made it nearly impossible for her to make it, or do anything else; and the desperately inexact science of medication, she once feared, might rob her of the creativity she cherished. The bulk of “Marbles” documents her wobbly progress toward stability, with interpolated drawings from her journals and occasional side trips into the history of “crazy artists.” It’s not exactly focused, but it’s mostly delightful: Forney switches up the style and layout of her artwork every page or two, and she’s got enough perspective on herself to find some kind of comedy even in painful experiences.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/books/review/marbles-by-ellen-forney-and-more.html

Three years after Blitzstein’s death from what was evidently a gay-­bashing in Martinique in 1964, Cop­land said, “It is disheartening to realize how little the present generation knows who he was or what he accomplished,” and Leonard Bernstein expressed dismay in 1976 at “the rapidity with which his name’s been forgotten,” calling him “the greatest master of the setting of the American language to music.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/books/review/marc-blitzstein-by-howard-pollack.html

Captor and captive developed a rapport, and ultimately, Bizot became the only Westerner to be released from Khmer Rouge captivity. Duch, meanwhile, went on to oversee the torture and murder of thousands of Cambodians at the notorious Tuol Sleng prison and in 2010 was the first person convicted by Cambodia’s war crimes tribunal.

Ms. Mannarino’s spellbinding performances in Sarah Michelson’s dances at both the Whitney Biennial and at the Museum of Modern Art have cemented her as a cherished muse and, in turn, transported an experimental choreographer’s work to a new level. And Mr. Lac, a contemporary dancer based in Europe, moves like a slippery piece of silk.

Last year, I recommended “Drops of God” as part of the 2011 Holiday Gift Guide and “Message to Adolf” made it on to my list of favorites this year. Part of my resistance is the sheer breadth of some manga series. For example, “Bakuman,” which enters our list at No. 5 this week, is on volume 17. “Black Bird,” at No. 6, is on volume 15. The two volumes of “Bleach” new to the list are Nos. 52 and 53. Other series simply don’t strike my fancy: “Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal,” at No. 1, is only on volume 2, but I’m not interested in “Duel Masters champions” who are assisted by mysterious spirits. Nor do I think I’m the right audience for “Sailor Moon,” volume 8 of which is on the list at No. 10.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/graphic-books-best-sellers-a-wave-of-new-series-on-the-manga-list/

Also on Friday, Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, created a post in her department, assistant secretary for global affairs, and appointed Dr. Nils Daulaire to it.

2012-12-17,Iran: Progress on Nuclear Talks," The leader of a United Nations nuclear inspection delegation reported progress on Friday in negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear energy work and said another meeting was planned for Jan. 16. But the leader, Herman Nackaerts, deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the Iranians still had not allowed the inspectors to visit Parchin, the military site where, inspectors suspect, nuclear weapons trigger testing work may have been conducted. Speaking to reporters upon his return in Vienna, home of the agency headquarters, Mr. Nackaerts described the negotiations held in Tehran on Thursday as “a good meeting” and expressed hope that the next round of talks would lead to a final agreement on an inspection plan, including a Parchin visit. Iran’s state-run media also reported progress had been achieved but made no mention of Parchin. Western diplomats who have long accused Iran of stalling tactics on the nuclear issue expressed skepticism. Some recalled that the nuclear agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, had been optimistic about a breakthrough last May after talks, only to be disappointed later.

2012-12-17,Russia: Vodka Saves Animals’ Lives," A Russian circus trainer fed a cocktail of warm water and vodka to two elephants stranded in the blistering Siberian cold on Thursday and credited it with saving their lives. A trailer carrying the Indian elephants caught fire on a highway in the Novosibirsk region, sending emergency workers scrambling to get the animals out of the cold and into a nearby garage, state media reported. The animals’ trainer, Leonid Labo, diluted two cases of vodka and fed the mixture to the animals, he told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular tabloid. The animals suffered nothing more serious than frostbite to their ears, a veterinarian said. The director of the Novosibirsk regional zoo said if not for the vodka, the animals certainly would have died. “In cold temperatures we give vodka to the elephants and the monkeys even when they are inside,” said the director, Rostislav Shilo. “But only domestic vodka.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/world/europe/russia-vodka-saves-animals-lives.html

(Sundance) FISH TANK (2010) Mia (Katie Jarvis, above), a restless 15-year-old living in a British housing project, develops a complicated relationship with the new boyfriend (Michael Fassbender) of her alcoholic mother (Kierston Wareing). At first he seems like good stepfather material in this drama from Andrea Arnold. And then he doesn’t. “Thanks to Ms. Arnold’s fine-grained realism” and “the astonishing performance” of Ms. Jarvis, a nonprofessional actress, the film “is a diamond-hard reflection on the peril and progress of a fragile soul in a bad situation,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movie “goes a little astray toward the end, in a scene of breathless pursuit across a marshy seaside wasteland,” he added. “Otherwise, ‘Fish Tank’ is nearly flawless.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Fox decided on Saturday that it would replace the planned episodes of two animated series, “Family Guy” and “American Dad,” that were to be broadcast Sunday night. The network made no official statement, but one executive confirmed that the decision was made because the content of the episodes could have been seen by some viewers as insensitive in light of these recent events. In both cases the networks scheduled repeats to fill those hours. Paramount Pictures has postponed the United States premiere of “Jack Reacher” in response to the shootings, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. This action film, which stars Tom Cruise and contains a scene in which a sniper attack leaves several people dead, was originally set to be unveiled on Dec. 15 in Pittsburgh, where a large portion of the movie was filmed.

2012-12-17,Feeling For | Heather Taylor Home’s Linens,"“I like to try to create a sense of warmth in a world that can feel cold,” says the gallerist and budding lifestyle guru Heather Taylor. Taylor De Cordoba, the space she owns with her husband, Alex De Cordoba, in Los Angeles’s Culver City gallery district not only shows emerging artists in an atypically cozy environment, but also hosts food-and-flower-festooned events like trunk shows for fashion-designer friends and Eating Our Words, a series teaming literary readings with artisanal tastings. (The New Yorker writer Dana Goodyear recited poetry as guests sampled desserts by ChocoVivo; the “Wild” author Cheryl Strayed was paired with I Heart Pies and Carmela ice cream.) These multisensory goings-on — along with Taylor’s frequent dinner parties and crafting sessions with haute-bohemian pals like Kirsty Hume and Shiva Rose — are documented on Taylor’s popular blog, L.A. in Bloom. Taylor, also a skilled knitter and weaver, holds a special fondness for the tactile pleasures of tabletop textiles: “Even if I’m just throwing together a quick dinner for myself, I want it to look beautiful,” she says. “When I’m setting a table, I feel an endorphin rush of excitement.” Taylor intends to spread that feeling with Heather Taylor Home, her new collection of decorative linens inspired by memories of convivial, casually chic meals in Mexico and Greece. The festive cocktail and dinner napkins, place mats and table runners are made from unprocessed linen hand-embroidered in India with folkloric motifs for a look that’s at once rustic and refined.

2012-12-18,Fears That Lack of Money Will Weaken Malaria Battle," The world has made great progress against malaria in the last decade, but the fight is stalling for lack of funds, the World Health Organization’s annual report on malaria concluded on Monday. The amount spent on the disease by all countries rose to $1.8 billion last year, compared with $100 million in 2000, and, as a result, about one million children’s lives were probably spared over that time, the report said. But it would take $5 billion a year to get nets, insecticide spraying, diagnostic kits, effective drugs and hospital treatment to everyone needing them, and donor contributions, especially to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, have been nearly flat since 2010. Last year, the number of new nets purchased fell sharply, to 66 million from 145 million two years ago. Since nets wear out in three years and children are always being born, large numbers of infants and toddlers will soon be unprotected if more money does not come in, the report warned. The W.H.O. estimated that there were 219 million malaria cases in the world in 2010, with 660,00 deaths.

The choristers said the extra duties violate their contract, but management argued they were no more than normally called for, according to Italian new reports. James Conlon, the American conductor and the music director of the Los Angeles Opera, was to have led the performance. Strikes or the threat of labor action at La Scala cause frequent disruptions, usually in opera productions.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/ballet-opening-night-at-la-scala-canceled-as-chorus-members-go-on-strike/

2012-12-19,New Label Alert | Roomeur,"Best friends since studying fashion design together in Israel, Hagit Kassif and Omer Pozner had always planned on starting a label together. Different paths brought them to New York — Diane von Furstenberg for Kassif, Elie Tahari for Pozner — then separated them again when Kassif headed to London to start a master’s degree at the Royal College of Art. But six months into her program, she called Pozner and told him it was time to stop dreaming and get to work. “I said, ‘Quit your job, this is it,'” she remembers. Reunited in New York and designing under the name Roomeur, the pair have just shown their first collection for prefall. Inspired by photographs of Frida Kahlo as well as by her artwork, it imagines the feminist icon transplanted to modern-day Gotham and in possession of, among other things, a brocade shorts suit and a draped black silk frock with a vibrant botanical print and a wrapped waist. “We were thinking of the two sides of Frida’s character,” Pozner says. “The hard and the soft.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/new-label-alert-roomeur/

How much of a turning point the hearings really represented in our progress toward polarization can be debated, but they certainly changed the way law and politics intersect: Everything from the shape of confirmation hearings to the career choices of would-be jurists to the trajectory of the modern conservative legal movement has been stamped by Bork’s defeat at the hands of Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden, and a united front of liberal interest groups.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/bork-and-liberalism/

Vladimir Ambroz, the head designer of A.M.O.S Design in what is now the Czech Republic, oversaw much of the recently completed two-year project, including the restoration of all the Mies-designed furniture. Mr. Ambroz thought that the original Brno chair, an endlessly copied classic, needed a companion piece that would be softer and more comfortable. This low lounge seat pays homage to the original — the tubular steel, for example, is the same — but the chair is wider and deeper for contemporary users.

The defendants’ lawyers argued that the faces of witnesses provided clues about the truthfulness of their testimony. Canada’s immigration minister recently barred women from wearing a niqab when taking the citizenship oath.

2012-12-21,Back From Madness,"In the vast and growing literature of ­affliction there is essentially one ­story: how the writer and her loved ones made it through. From a literary point of view, everything depends on the sensibility of the narrator, her comportment both as the teller and as the main character in her own tale. The reader’s resistance to these stories can be strong. Severe illness, by its nature, narrows the focus; the palette of experience both intensifies and shrinks; we crawl into the bush, figuratively speaking, and wait out our fate, fighting to survive. There is little suspense: the existence of the memoir is testament to the fact that the author has lived to tell the tale. But what hard-won nugget of wisdom has she brought back from her brief descent into a hell that most of us, for now, have been lucky enough to avoid? Can she give her ordeal meaning beyond the brute fact of the thing itself? ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/books/review/brain-on-fire-by-susannah-cahalan.html

If I speak from experience, having one brother, think how much more is George Howe Colt, with three — an older, Harry, and two younger, Ned and Mark — authorized to expatiate on the subject. Anyone who’s had the pleasure of reading Colt’s previous, National Book Award-­nominated work, “The Big House” (2003), will know his delicate, detailed, ironically self-­mocking way with prose, and his lucid, affectionate fair-­mindedness.

It wasn’t until mid-October that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney felt compelled to address the problem of gun violence — and then only because an undecided voter asked them about it at the town-hall presidential debate. As Stephen Colbert joked afterward: “Now is not the time to discuss gun control. We haven’t had a mass shooting in almost 49 days.” A mere four days after Colbert’s quip, another mass shooting left three people dead and four injured at a Wisconsin day spa.

In a recent phone interview, Marciuliano told me he wrote the book while mourning his two cats, Boris and Natasha (“named after the characters in ‘Rocky and Bullwinkle,’ ” he clarified, “not ‘War and Peace’ ”), who had lived with him for some 17 years. “When you spend any real time with cats,” he said, “you eventually try to figure out what on earth is going on in their brains.

Also, for “Fortuny: An Artistic Legacy,” the set designer Stefan Beckman (he does Marc Jacobs’s shows, among other presentations) has created a spare but powerful design that helps illuminate the multiple talents and paradoxical nature of Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo.

The resort collection, which is available beginning today on the Friends & Associates Web site, features lots of crisp cottons and an oversize polka dot print in what Edelstein calls “candy store” colors; spring offerings, pictured here, are a continuation of the same athletic-inspired theme with a buffalo check thrown into the mix.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/new-label-alert-friends-associates/

The publication reported this week that it had obtained documents that said one or more witnesses had told officials that Mr. Wang had examined a container of cyanide with Gu Kailai, the wife of Bo Xilai, the former party chief of Chongqing, on Nov. 12, 2011. Ms. Gu had thought up a plot to kill Mr. Heywood by poisoning him, and Mr. Wang encouraged her on Nov. 13 to meet Mr. Heywood for dinner and then poison him, the report said. During this year’s trial of Ms. Gu, witnesses said she tried to think of ways to kill Mr. Heywood with Mr. Wang, but the statements did not indicate Mr. Wang had played a direct role in the poisoning plot, according to one lawyer at the trial. Ms. Gu was convicted of Mr. Heywood’s murder and was given a commuted death sentence; she could be imprisoned for life.

He served for years as Cuba’s main point man on relations with the United States, and he has often been described as Cuba’s third-most powerful official. But Mr. Alarcón was also seen as a loyalist of Fidel more than Raúl, and speculation about his fate has been swirling since last summer, when the police arrested one of his top aides on suspicion of corruption and spying.

2012-12-24,Send in the Clowns,"WHEN thinking about the state of the Republican Party, I defer to a point that the Democratic consultant James Carville made the other day: “When I hear people talking about the troubled state of today’s Republican Party, it calls to mind something Lester Maddox said one time back when he was governor of Georgia. He said the problem with Georgia prisons was ‘the quality of the inmates.’ The problem with the Republican Party is the quality of the people who vote in their primaries and caucuses. Everybody says they need a better candidate, or they need a better message but — in my opinion — the Republicans have an inmate problem.” The political obsessions of the Republican base — from denying global warming to defending assault weapons to opposing any tax increases under any conditions, to resisting any immigration reform — are making it impossible to be a Republican moderate, said Carville. And without more Republican moderates, there is no way to strike the kind of centrist bargains that have been at the heart of American progress — that got us where we are and are essential for where we need to go.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-send-in-the-clowns.html

More specifically, I’d like focus pretty intensely on what some consider to be the key moment in his greatest novel — arguably one of the greatest of all time — “The Brothers Karamazov.” (Elie himself notes the 1880 masterpiece as an example of the truly faith-engaged fiction of yore.) I speak in particular of the “Grand Inquisitor” scene, a sort of fiction within a fiction that draws on something powerful from the New Testament — Jesus’s refusal of Satan’s three temptations — and in doing so digs at the meaning of faith, freedom, happiness and the diabolic satisfaction of our desires.

CBS is close to finishing new contracts with the show’s creators and cast to extend the series and bring it back for a ninth season, according to Entertainment Weekly’s Web site. Jason Segel, who has built an impressive film résumé while also starring in “How I Met Your Mother,” was reported to be reluctant to return but is said to have signed on.

2012-12-24,A Kesha Reversal On ‘Die Young’ Lyrics,"The Newtown, Conn., school shootings have had reverberations in the radio world, as lyrics that seemed within the bounds of good taste two weeks ago are suddenly hitting a flat note. A case in point is Kesha’s recent hit “Die Young,” a lightweight party tune about living for the moment. Though the theme of the song is carpe diem, it contains the chorus: “Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young/We’re gonna die young/We’re gonna die young.” Program directors at pop stations in Connecticut and around the country took the song out of their rotations in the days after the Dec. 14 shootings. Another song receiving very few spins these days is “Pumped Up Kicks,” last year’s Foster the People hit, which tells the story of a student shooting his classmates. The airplay for Kesha’s song dropped 19 percent on the Billboard Radio Songs chart this week, and the song has dipped to No. 4 from No. 3 on the Hot 100 single chart. Several program directors said the drop-off in airplay would be temporary, Billboard reported. In a string of Twitter posts last week, Kesha, below, apologized and asserted that she had objected to the lyrics but was “forced” to sing them. “I did NOT want to sing those lyrics and I was FORCED TO,” she wrote, in a post that was later taken down. She later posted a message on her Web site trying to clarify: “After such a tragic event I was feeling a lot of emotion and sadness when I said I was forced to sing some of the lyrics to ‘Die Young.’ Forced is not the right word. I did have some concerns about the phrase ‘die young’ in the chorus when we were writing the lyrics especially because so many of my fans are young and that’s one reason why I wrote so many versions of this song. But the point of the song is the importance of living every day to the fullest and staying young at heart, and these are things I truly believe.” Kesha is one of several songwriters on “Die Young.” The list includes Lukasz Gottwald (known as Dr. Luke), Benny Blanco, Cirkut and the group Fun.’s frontman, Nate Ruess.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/arts/music/a-kesha-reversal-on-die-young-lyrics.html

Because these solos deal purely with steps and movements, with no evident characterization or narrative gesture, it’s easy to miss the ways in which they operate as drama. Alone, a Cunningham dancer investigates movement, space and time with a quality of contemplation that often turns dance into a stream-of-consciousness soliloquy. A dancer may return to a step like a default position or a habit of thought; may suddenly — and frequently — change direction and tempo as if changing the subject; may change position in midair as if meeting a challenge.

In what is sure to be one of the last gallery openings of 2012, his show “Tables, Heads and Arms” will make its debut three days after Christmas at Eden Rock on the island of St. Barts. For a 2011 show at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, Fischer made 300 tabletops, only two-thirds of which were ever displayed in New York. Twenty-one from the remaining lot will go on view in St. Barts, along with an assortment of found objects (chairs, vases, lamps), a new sculpture cast from Fischer’s forearms and several hand-painted figurines. The pop culture references here run the gamut from Tom Hanks in “Da Vinci Code” mode to E.P.A. warning signs to Big Bird, who rather solemnly graces the announcement card. But before reading political subtext into the Sesame Street character’s appearance, it’s worth remembering that Fischer titled a 2010 exhibition “Oscar the Grouch” and that he has a 3-year-old daughter, Lotti, with the artist Cassandra MacLeod.

2012-12-24,Bond Vigilantes and the Power of Three,"Matthew Yglesias picks up on a point I’ve tried to make at some length recently: the popular story about how an attack by bond vigilantes can cause an interest rate spike and turn America into Greece, Greece I tell you, is incoherent. (Here’s a 2010 example from Alan Greenspan — the piece in which he declares it “regrettable” that the vigilantes haven’t yet attacked, but grudgingly concedes that low rates might persist “well into next year”, that is, into 2011. So what has he learned from the failure of his prophecy? Nothing, of course). It’s not just that there have so far been no signs of the bond vigilantes; it’s that even if for some reason the vigilantes did attack, it’s very hard to see how they could cause a recession in a country that retains its own currency and doesn’t have large amounts of debt denominated in foreign currency.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/bond-vigilantes-and-the-power-of-three/

A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called the movie an “indigestible Christmas pudding.” He added that a “genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, playing a washed-up, dissolute rock star named Billy Mack, who is trying for a comeback with a treacly Christmas record.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

The dainty pieces, which rest on aluminum bases, stayed in production until 1963 — a time when the company was abandoning residential furniture to focus on its office business. Miller has twice tried to revive the Japanese-inspired goods: once in 1994, when it reintroduced its home collection (they failed to sell), and again in 2005 (the chests were made in Asia, and the poor quality of the craftsmanship ultimately doomed the project). Bringing the chests back “is one of my favorite examples of doing the right thing,” said Ben Watson, creative director of Herman Miller, who is resurrecting a number of forgotten items from the company’s archives. This time around, the chests are made in the United States and have the same hand-fitted drawers as the originals. They are available in a wide range of solid woods with white or black metal pulls. The six-drawer chest is $2,809, the nine-drawer chest, $3,192; the optional base, $418.

All began as Ms. Housley’s hand drawings, which she scans, then redraws stitch by stitch in a computer file. The files are sent to India to be machine embroidered, but thanks to Ms. Housley’s method, the finished goods are quirky, with perfectly imperfect stitching that makes each piece look hand-made.

But how can her mother not feed her, when she and her husband feel that food is “made of love, and love . . . made of food”? How can these parents deny Edie life-giving nourishment when Edie’s father, a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, nearly starved on his journey to Chicago and has never been able to get enough to eat since? Even though it’s clear that young Edie suffers under her own weight — she huffs and puffs up the stairs “like someone’s gassy old uncle after a meal” — her mother can’t refuse her the liverwurst and rye bread she loves. This is a Jewish mother after all, and those of us who’ve had one know that the message, when it comes to food, is always have a little more. It’s an attitude that comes not just from love, but also from fear; a history fraught with disaster and hunger gives rise to the feeling that one must always be prepared.

2012-12-28,Shock to the Senses,"Since his first extraordinary work, “Migraine,” was published in 1970, the neurologist Oliver Sacks has been writing a particular kind of medical literature. His detailed explications of a single patient’s symptoms, his emphasis on the subjective experience of illness, his willingness to share stories from his own life and his references to medical texts from earlier centuries are not only atypical of how most neurologists work today, they defy the status quo. And yet, Sacks’ work is part of a long tradition of descriptive, narrative, case-oriented medical writing he has himself called “romantic.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/hallucinations-by-oliver-sacks.html

2012-12-28,Crimes Without Punishment,"It might seem surprising that only now — 14 years after José Saramago won the Nobel Prize in Literature and two years after his death — is this major novel, first published in Portugal in 1980, appearing in English translation. Then again, politically radical fiction is often a tough sell in our market. While Saramago was an outspoken member of his country’s Communist Party (“Marx was never so right as now,” he remarked at the outset of the recent global financial crisis), in his best-known work his politics are embedded in allegory or fantasy, allowing readers to view them as loosely humanist or to overlook them entirely. Not so with “Raised From the Ground.” Still, what’s apt to strike readers of this book is not so much that it’s radical but that it’s topical. “What kind of world,” it asks, “divides into those who make a profession of idleness and those who want work but can’t get it”? The novel even ends with descriptions of a kind of Occupy movement — though one with higher stakes — as peasants take over farm estates whose owners have relocated rather than pay their workers a living wage.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/raised-from-the-ground-by-jose-saramago.html

Bis­singer’s “Friday Night Lights” became the touchstone some two decades ago, generating its own branded feature film, television series and follow-up e-book. It set the standard for countless similar tales, most notably Michael Lewis’s “Blind Side” and the Academy Award-­winning documentary “Undefeated.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/muck-city-by-bryan-mealer.html

The narrator, Nate, is about to turn 21. He lives with his mother and her current squeeze, “Fake Dad No. 3.” Mostly, he drifts and looks for work in a somewhat desultory fashion. His ambition, such as it is, is to join his best friend, Necro (né Andrea: “Everyone in Rochester is Italians”), at Kodak, the firm that made Rochester famous. But it’s 1999, and the prospects are bleak for old-fashioned companies like Kodak and for Rust Belt cities like Rochester, whose nickname hasn’t been “City of Quality” since the 1960s.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/maverick-jetpants-in-the-city-of-quality-by-bill-peters.html
2012-12-28,Stage Manager,"Writing in his memoirs, Tennessee Williams remembers paying a visit to Thornton Wilder after the New Haven opening of “A Streetcar Named Desire” (1947). Wilder — then at the height of his eminence, having won Pulitzers for both “Our Town” (1938) and “The Skin of Our Teeth” (1942) — dismissed Williams’s latest effort with the air of one “delivering a papal bull,” as Williams put it. A “lady” like Stella, Wilder declared, would never marry a “vulgarian” like Stanley Kowalski. “This character,” Williams reflected of his colleague at the time, “has never had a good lay.” With the perspicacity that would lead him to become, arguably, our greatest postwar playwright, Williams had pretty much hit the nail on the head.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/thornton-wilder-a-life-by-penelope-niven.html

Chaplin faces a challenge in “Round About the Earth.” She’s written a 535-page history of circumnavigation, from the voyages of Ferdinand Magellan (1519-22) to the Dutch teenager Laura Dekker (2011-12), which is to say the history of a highly conceptual and antiquated exploit. We all sense that encircling the planet is — or was — quite a feat. But a feat of what, exactly? Today it’s possible to book a round-the-world air ticket simply by tapping a smartphone. After Magellan’s expedition did it the first time, one wonders if there’s any sense in recording all those who came after.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/round-about-the-earth-by-joyce-e-chaplin.html
2012-12-28,Soviet Dreams,"A superstitious tradition, meant to protect children from vengeful spirits, persists in Spanish-­speaking countries — naming babies for the opposite qualities that benevolent parents might be expected to wish upon their offspring. Parents who want their daughters to lead joyful lives might name them Dolores (“sorrows,” “pain”) or Soledad (“loneliness”). A boy might be called Tristán (“the sad one”). But Andrey Platonov, the beleaguered Soviet writer who died in 1951 of tuberculosis (contracted from his son, who had been infected in Stalin’s gulag), seems to have pursued the reverse strategy when, in the mid-1930s, he began work on an allegorical novella entitled “Happy Moscow,” to see whether it was “objectively impossible” to write a bona fide “Soviet” work of fiction.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/happy-moscow-by-andrey-platonov.html

(Some were more ominous than others: “Secret of two, secret of God; secret of three, secret of all.”) Such behavior made her reputation, though it was her magnificent art collection, assembled with the help of the young Bernard Berenson, that won her lasting fame. In 1903, Gardner opened her Venetian-style gallery — then called Fenway Court — to the city of Boston, enriching generations to come.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/books/review/the-art-forger-by-b-a-shapiro.html

His friendship with the ferocious satirist and pornographer Pietro Aretino is the stuff of speculation.

When Whitman arrived at the field hospital set up in a mansion, he found a scene from hell, watched over by an imposing angel: Clara Barton moved amid screams of surgery, ministering to youths, bandaging the bleeding and soothing the dying with low-spoken words and water.

The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a commander, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, as saying the exercises were meant to transmit a message of friendship to neighbors and display “the armed forces’ military capabilities.” Iran, which periodically conducts such naval maneuvers, has said it could close the Strait of Hormuz as retaliation for Western sanctions imposed over Iran’s disputed nuclear energy program.

That is not to say that Mr. Wing, 44 and a Seattle native, doesn’t work out. His Sundays are usually devoted to “recovery work” — fitness-fan-speak for flexibility and range-of-motion training. He also exercises by chasing his 20-month-old son, Asher, around his apartment in Astoria, Queens, while his wife, Morgan, 36, a social worker, takes a bit of well-deserved rest.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/nyregion/court-wing-works-out-on-sundays-by-keeping-up-with-his-toddler.html

2012-12-31,What’s On Saturday,"11:15 A.M. (Showtime) STARDUST (2007) Charlie Cox is Tristan, a young man desperate to prove that he would do anything to win the love of his lady fair (Sienna Miller), which includes bringing her a falling star that recently crashed near their village. But to reach the star he must travel to the magical realm of Stormhold, where the star takes the form of a human (Claire Danes, above with Mr. Cox). He also encounters a rapidly aging witch, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), and the cross-dressing captain (Robert De Niro) of a flying pirate ship. Directed by Matthew Vaughn and adapted from the graphic novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess, this fantasy tale “barrels forward with a fearless audacity,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Holden found Ms. Pfeiffer’s Lamia to be “as deliciously evil a witch as the movies have ever invented.” He added, “As the embodiment of every vain, wicked stepmother in fairy tale literature mixed with the cauldron-tending crones of ‘Macbeth’ (Lamia is one of three cackling sisters), Ms. Pfeiffer goes for broke with the relish of a star who figures she has nothing to lose.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

But when bidding reached only £12,000 ($19,500), they withdrew the disc.
