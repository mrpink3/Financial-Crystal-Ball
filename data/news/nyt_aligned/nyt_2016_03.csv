His chef, Thomas Slivovsky, was at the Paulaner restaurant on the Bowery and at Kurt Gutenbrunner’s Blaue Gans in TriBeCa, and before that at Drei Husaren in Vienna. “We opened Vienna 79 when nouvelle cuisine was in fashion, so we went with a modernized, lighter version of Viennese cooking,” Mr. Grünauer said. It’s pretty much what you will find here. But unlike 30 years ago, there will ample Austrian wines to sample.

As a result, his international reputation, which had flourished in the years before his accident, suddenly stalled; while he lay in a coma, his archive was held by a gallery in Japan, and it became near-impossible for European and American galleries and publishers to borrow original prints. “Hibi” was only exhibited by the artist for one evening in 1991 (and is still marked with pinholes from that show), and has never before been seen outside Tokyo.

In the Judeo-Christian tradition, even God submits to our chutzpah and brings to the brand-new Adam all the creatures he has made to see how Adam would define them. “And whatsoever Adam called every living creature,” Genesis tells us, “that was the name thereof.” In the beginning was a dictionary.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/books/review/you-could-look-it-up-by-jack-lynch.html

Fallout from the Salem witch trials of 1692 had ­discredited the colony’s Congregationalist ministers. It didn’t help that a young firebrand named Franklin began to print a newspaper that mocked both the government and the ministers. Perhaps most dangerously, smallpox had spread from an infected ship to people ashore.

But the work didn’t always come easy. “When I started out 35 years ago,” she told a newspaper in Savannah, Ga., recently, “I saw a quote from Phyllis Whitney: ‘There has never been an easy time to sell a book.’ I wanted this more than I ever wanted anything in my life. I got rejected so fast, my manuscripts would hit me in the back of the head on my way back from the post office.” But Macomber never gave up. “It has a lot to do with stubbornness and desire,” she said, adding that she similarly trained herself to run despite a lack of athletic ability. In both cases, “It was making myself stick to it until I could do it. It got to the point where it didn’t hurt anymore.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/books/review/inside-the-list.html

(I’d call Melville’s 14,000-plus-word “Bartleby” a novella — he called it a “tale” — and Joyce’s “The Dead,” some 1,500 words longer, a story.) Certainly Jim Harrison isn’t sniffy about the word — in fact, Jim Harrison isn’t sniffy about much — and since his first collection of novellas, the 1979 “Legends of the Fall,” he has done as much as any living writer to demonstrate the validity and vitality of the form.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/books/review/the-ancient-minstrel-by-jim-harrison.html

It wasn’t until he was watching TV on a family trip to Indonesia in 2004, however, when a contestant on the show “Indonesian Idol” sang one of his parents’ songs that he learned that just how famous his parents had been. “I was like, ‘Hang on a second — how big were you guys?’” Despite growing up in what he describes as “a very musical household,” Abraham eschewed the family business as an 18-year-old in favor of five years of film school, turning to music only after a professor (“a scary, kind of crotchety stalwart of the Australian writing scene”) offered a particularly stinging critique of his work. “He went through my script scene by scene, and at the end he sort of looked at me and went, ‘It’s just not very interesting, is it?’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/t-magazine/entertainment/ben-abraham-singer-songwriter.html

A Saudi-led military coalition started fighting in Yemen last year after the Houthis seized Sana, the capital, and drove Yemen’s government from power. The United Nations has sponsored several failed attempts to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 3,000 civilians and left most of the country in need of humanitarian aid. Representatives of the Houthis traveled to Saudi Arabia this week to discuss prisoner exchanges and a de-escalation of fighting along the Saudi-Yemeni border. It was hoped that the talks would lead to a broader agreement to end the war, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, which have not been publicly announced.

2016-03-09,Canada: Government Raises Its Target for Admitting Political Refugees," After achieving its initial target of admitting 25,000 refugees from Syria late last month, the government said Tuesday that Canada would bring in a total of 55,800 political refugees this year, many of them fleeing the Syrian civil war. Despite the Liberal government’s push to admit Syrian refugees, many private groups that have raised money to sponsor refugee families still find themselves without anyone to host. John McCallum, the immigration minister, said that the government would triple the annual limit for privately sponsored refugees to 18,000 people this year. The new limits are part of an overall goal of admitting 305,000 immigrants, a portion of whom are political refugees, as permanent residents this year, compared with 285,000 last year. Mr. McCallum said the rules would be changed to make it easier for previous immigrants to bring family members to the country.

Judge Sergio Moro, in a 234-page decision, said that Mr. Odebrecht had paid about $30 million in bribes to officials at Petrobras and had used overseas accounts and secret offshore accounts to make many of the illicit payments.

And the migrant writer hatched a new language along the way. “To conquer English may be to complete the process of making ourselves free,” Rushdie wrote in his 1991 essay collection, “Imaginary Homelands.” Shoals of people still move across the world today, but the idea of a literature of migration seems to have fallen out of fashion — not with readers but with writers, some of whom chafe at being narrowly categorized, consigned to an ethnic beat, their work treated as sociology instead of art.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/books/review/new-ways-of-being.html

That case, though, is just the tip of a very deep iceberg exposed when a high-ranking police officer is charged with euthanizing his ailing wife, and Janet suspects murder. What follows as she connects the dots threatens to tear her relationship with her companion and their twins asunder — and possibly end her own life.  Ms. Dusseldorp has said that her role model was Helen Mirren’s detective in “Prime Suspect,” for whom justice trumped likability.

2016-03-11,Inside the List,"Let’s Get Physical: If you believe Einstein, time as we usually understand it is “nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion.” That may be. But timing is still everything — and the timing could hardly be better for the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli’s latest book, “Seven Brief Lessons on Physics,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. Originally published two years ago in Rovelli’s native Italy (where it outsold “Fifty Shades of Grey”), the book arrives in America less than a month after scientists announced the first direct evidence of gravitational waves, confirming Einstein’s theory of general relativity and reigniting the public’s occasional love affair with what may be the hardest of the hard sciences. (Over the years, other theoretical physicists to hit the list have included Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Lisa Randall and Lawrence Krauss.) Rovelli, as it happens, is an expert on gravity: He’s a founder of the loop quantum gravity theory, the chief competitor to string theory among efforts to unite the macro world of relativity with the micro world of quantum mechanics. So he was giddy at the news that gravitational waves had been detected. “For physicists this is an ecstatic moment,” he wrote on Slate. “If a benign nature wanted to honor the centenary of Einstein’s idea, she has found the most elegant way. It’s hard to imagine a more vivid indication of the power of scientific reason: From indirect evidence and clarity of thought, reason sees so far that it takes another century before our eyes and our hands can follow up.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2016-03-11,"‘Anna and the Swallow Man,’ by Gavriel Savit","There are two questions about Gavriel Savit’s splendid debut novel that are sure to be asked repeatedly: Is it an allegory, and at whom is it aimed? The first I believe Savit answers clearly. “The world understands stories,” he has one of his main characters come to realize, “not as absolute, irrevocably factual truths that simply don’t exist, but as flaccid allegories or metaphors.” You may read the novel as allegory; go ahead. All stories are allegory. This one makes use of stock figures from European folklore (the fool, the golem, the trickster, the demon, animal shape-changers). It’s also tempting to expand on ways in which the novel’s characters represent aspects of the Polish people during World War II. Even the winsome chapter-heading designs created by the illustrator Laura Carlin can be interpreted in more than one way. But Anna and the Swallow Man, and the very human people they meet in the course of the novel, also have their own plausible existence within the rules of the world we know. Indeed, they learn to question and distrust allegory as the tale progresses. For every apparent piece of magic performed in the text, there is a scientific explanation. When the Swallow Man gives Anna a fantastical description of the medicine he takes, for example, there is a literal interpretation as well. This is masterly storytelling.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/books/review/anna-and-the-swallow-man-by-gavriel-savit.html

There is no such thing as the Friendship Plot, because while friendship, like marriage, is at least presumably a voluntary estate, it has no official consummation, no church- or state-sanctioned vows. It would seem, then, that the literary form most suited to its pick-up-where-we-left-off, drop-me-when-you-couple-up-and-have-kids ebb and flow might be the story cycle, or serial tale — just ask Quixote and Sancho, or Huck and Tom, or the four dudes of “The Three Musketeers.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/books/review/innocents-and-others-by-dana-spiotta.html

(Although Ruby grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania, his parents allowed him to slip off to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. for concerts, as long as he made it to school in the mornings.) He mentions seeing H.R. from Bad Brains in denim and Black Flag’s Greg Ginn, who favored Oxford shirts, and Henry Rollins, in only his running shorts.

Pablo Heras-Casado, principal conductor of the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, also from Spain’s Andalusian region, prefers hewing to the composer’s original vision, and so, in a concert on Thursday at Carnegie Hall, he paired the gritty voice of the flamenco singer Marina Heredia  with the polished, smoothly-sensual sound of the orchestra.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/arts/music/review-echoes-of-flamenco-from-orchestra-of-st-lukes.html

But Divola didn’t care so much about conceptual trends — and frankly still doesn’t. “My work is still very indexical,” he says. “My work is still about: time, place, and circumstance. I make these literal imprints of what’s in front of me, and then I bring them back and they’re my artifacts of my actual engagement with the world.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/t-magazine/art/john-divola-theodore-street-photographs.html

Until recently, the art in Guadalajara has tended toward the folkloric: The town is primarily known for earthen ceramics, as well as for mariachi bands (the genre originated in the region). ‘‘It used to be that creative people got out of here as soon as possible,’’ says the artist Eduardo Sarabia, who moved to Guadalajara from Los Angeles and co-founded an art ‘‘laboratory’’ called PAOS that hosts residencies and exhibits in the stark studio that once belonged to the great Modernist muralist José Clemente Orozco. ‘‘But that’s changed.’’ Sarabia is part of a wave of young artists and gallerists who’re remaking the town into a sort of mellow, sunny-skies utopia. He’s joined by the young Spaniards Silvia Ortiz and Inés López-Quesada, who opened a branch of their Madrid gallery, Travesía Cuatro, in the upscale Colonia Lafayette neighborhood a few years ago in order to be closer to some of their key artists — local talent who have seen their stars rise on the contemporary scene, including Jose Dávila, Gonzalo Lebrija and Jorge Méndez Blake.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/t-magazine/travel/guadalajara-mexico-arts.html

But at this handsome new restaurant, it is given top billing and an elegance rarely associated with what in Japan is usually a quick meal of grilled chicken bits. “Yakitori is changing in Japan,” said Yuko Hagiwara, the manager of the restaurant, which is owned by a Japanese company. “It’s becoming more high-end because chicken is very expensive.” Here, several yakitori dishes, made with chicken from Bo Bo Poultry in Brooklyn, include chicken breast with beets and chicken tenders with mushrooms. They are part of a $150 10-course kaiseki menu served at a U-shaped stone counter facing the open kitchen and at tables around the room. The chef is Nobutaka Watanabe, working alongside Yuichiro Yoshimura, a yakitori expert. The room is designed to suggest the ryokan, a type of traditional country inn, that the parent company owns in northern Japan. Layers of wavy maple meant to resemble the sea cover one wall. (Opens Friday): 246 Fifth Avenue (entrance on 28th Street), 917-388-3596, teisui.nyc.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/teisui-gives-yakitori-top-billing-in-nomad.html

A few people stand, some staring dreamily up at a high row of windows that split the sky into perfect squares of indigo blue. The experimental music artist William Basinski is at the center of the hangar, his mirrored sunglasses focused on a table topped with computers, volume knobs, a thick knot of electrical cords. From the speakers flanking him comes a sweet, synthesized drone — complex tones that fill the massive space, lulling the audience into a kind of midday trance. Wind blasts at the cavernous arch of corrugated steel roofing, creating an aching, eerie, metallic rhythm, creaks and pops that seem somehow syncopated to Basinki’s improvised soundscape.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/t-magazine/entertainment/marfa-myths-art-music-festival.html

On Sunday, March 20, at 3:30 p.m., the collaborators will host a discussion with other choreographers who work in film, including Jillian Peña.

2016-03-16,Trump Rises,"My insta-reaction to last night’s primaries focused on the defeat of Marco Rubio, but it’s worth saying something about the overall state of the race as well — and what I have to say, unfortunately for the anti-Trumpist cause, is that my analysis from eight days ago predicting a contested convention (and a not-Trump outcome) looks weaker than it did. The reason is straightforward: A week ago Trump was still averaging, as he’d averaged from the earliest contests onward, about 34 percent of the primary vote. But last night Trump won at least 39 percent of the vote in every state except Ohio, and even there, in his loss to John Kasich, he still came away with more than 35 percent. That five point boost is why he beat Ted Cruz in both Missouri and North Carolina: Cruz reached 40 percent in the former and the high 30s in the latter, which would have been enough to beat Trump in a lot of prior contests, from Michigan to Arkansas to Kentucky … but wasn’t enough to win this time around. And if that boost holds, if Trump’s new average is 40 percent, in a three-way race that could certainly open a path to 1,237 delegates; it’s still a path without a huge margin for error, but it makes his nomination much more likely than when he appeared to be stuck five points lower.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/trump-rising/

Set mostly in the late 1980s, the coming-of-age film serves as an origin story for Desplechin’s 1996 film, “My Sex Life ... or How I Got Into an Argument.” The director revisits his characters Paul Dedalus and Esther — first played by Mathieu Amalric and Emmanuelle Devos — in their relationship as teenagers, but now uses an unknown cast that includes Quentin Dolmaire as Paul and Lou Roy-Lecollinet as his object of desire. The film is a referential collage, moving through a series of genres and incorporating a jukebox of dance-party pop songs and impressions of Desplechin’s eclectic cinematic taste.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/t-magazine/entertainment/arnaud-desplechin-film-my-golden-days.html

That term infuriated Moroccan leaders and led to demonstrations in Morocco last Sunday directed against Mr. Ban, who described them as disrespectful. Morocco’s foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, who conferred with Mr. Ban on Monday in what diplomats described as a tense meeting, said he had informed Mr. Ban that his country was cutting “a large part” of its civilian support for the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara and evaluating whether to withdraw Moroccan troops from all peacekeeping operations. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Ban, described the Moroccan response as regrettable. Morocco seized Western Sahara, a former Spanish protectorate, in 1976, and fought a war against a pro-independence movement, the Polisario Front. The United Nations has been trying since 1991 to resolve the conflict. Morocco has insisted on its sovereignty.

I once watched one of them almost overdose on laughing gas, leering, muttering nastily at my head, his face blue as day. It was indecent, his romance with death. It should have been private.

2016-03-17,The Secrets of the Wave Pilots,"At 0400, three miles above the Pacific seafloor, the searchlight of a power boat swept through a warm June night last year, looking for a second boat, a sailing canoe. The captain of the canoe, Alson Kelen, potentially the world’s last-ever apprentice in the ancient art of wave-piloting, was trying to reach Aur, an atoll in the Marshall Islands, without the aid of a GPS device or any other way-finding instrument. If successful, he would prove that one of the most sophisticated navigational techniques ever developed still existed and, he hoped, inspire efforts to save it from extinction. Monitoring his progress from the power boat were an unlikely trio of Western scientists — an anthropologist, a physicist and an oceanographer — who were hoping his journey might help them explain how wave pilots, in defiance of the dizzying complexities of fluid dynamics, detect direction and proximity to land. More broadly, they wondered if watching him sail, in the context of growing concerns about the neurological effects of navigation-by-smartphone, would yield hints about how our orienteering skills influence our sense of place, our sense of home, even our sense of self.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/magazine/the-secrets-of-the-wave-pilots.html

Exotic and sweetly astringent, they were a standby of posh dinner parties throughout the Commonwealth, the sort of dish that was not particularly difficult to make but still signaled a home cook’s understanding of elegance.

2016-03-18,Thirteen Contemporary Artists Portray Their Own Children,"As a young person learning her trade, the French artist Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842) was trained exclusively in portraiture, a properly feminine pursuit. Vigée Le Brun then became a society portraitist, and for more than a century was looked down upon for that. (There’s a drawback to having your lucky break be a commissioned painting of Marie Antoinette.) At first Vigée Le Brun’s stepfather made off with much of her earnings; she then married a charismatic man of taste who again and again spent her money on finery, though he did successfully market Vigée Le Brun as an artist, and arranged high fees for her work. Some said the fees were too high, that she was not that good; others said her work was too good to have actually been done by a woman, that it must in fact have been done by a man, maybe a lover. Perhaps the most predictable of the gripes directed against Vigée Le Brun was Simone de Beauvoir’s: In dismissing a series of female artists, she wrote disparagingly of Vigée Le Brun that she ‘‘never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases,’’ even though only two of the extant Vigée Le Brun portraits are of herself with her daughter.

His best-known novel, “An Instance of the Fingerpost,” explored a 17th-century Oxford murder and its aftermath through the memoirs of four unreliable narrators, each hotly disputing the others’ versions of reality, science, religion and justice. After nearly 700 pages of deposition, when the guilty are finally sorted from the hard-to-call-innocent, many readers will understandably have already lost track of their scorecards. Now, almost 20 years later, Pears’s latest novel presents a complexly interwoven series of narrative entanglements that stretch across time, alternate universes and at least several textual realities — from Elizabethan pastoral romance and multiple universe theory to a Narnia-like fantasy world and Cold War international intrigue.

2016-03-23,Political Substance Abuse: Donald Trump’s Washington Press Conference,"This installment of Political Substance Abuse is set in the “Old Post Office,” in Washington, D.C., a historic building that The Trump Organization is converting into a hotel. Donald Trump held a press conference there on Monday as part of a day trip to the nation’s capital that many media commentators called “trying to look presidential.” Mr. Trump met with legislators on Capitol Hill and visited the editorial board of the Washington Post, where he revealed that rather than solely advising himself on foreign affairs, he sometimes relies on a collection of mostly-unknown advisers, who help him advise himself. He sat down to an on-camera, in-person interview on CNN, instead of phoning it in, as he usually does, then capped his day by speaking at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s conference. Mr. Trump had an actual speech written for his AIPAC appearance, and he used a teleprompter, despite saying, in Florida last week, verbatim: “No teleprompters. Do you notice? I’m not reading speeches. No reading speeches. No reading speeches. Speak from the heart, and from the head. But speak from the heart. We gotta do it. We gotta do it. We speak from the heart.

But at times the vignette a candidate chooses sheds light — for better or worse — on his or her personality. At Monday’s conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, a prime opportunity to woo pro-Israel voters, every candidate drew from examples of terrorist outrages against Israel to condemn extremists in the Middle East. Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton all appeared in person, delivering staunch and often hawkish pledges to defend Israeli national security. Bernie Sanders did not appear in Washington but delivered his AIPAC speech at a school in Salt Lake City, where he was campaigning.

2016-03-24,‘Shuffle Along’ and the Lost History of Black Performance in America,"Ninety-­five years ago in New York, a journalist named Lester Walton bought a ticket to see a much-­buzzed-­about new show, a “musical novelty” that had opened about a week before at the Sixty-­Third Street Theater. Or the Sixty-­Third Street Music Hall, as it was more properly called. A kind of multipurpose performance space, not very big, not very nice, “sandwiched in between garages,” Walton wrote, and “little known to the average Broadway theatergoer.” You could rent the place for the night. It had philosophical lectures, amateur violin recitals and religious meetings, and during the day it showed silent movies: “ ‘Pudd’n Head Wilson,’ with Theodore Roberts, tomorrow.” But on this evening — and for many months to come, as it turned out — the stage belonged to an all-black show called “Shuffle Along,” a comedy with lots of singing and dancing. A problem: The music hall had no orchestra pit, and this show needed an orchestra. It needed space for the band, which happened to include a 25-year-old musician known as Bill Still, later to become the famous composer William Grant Still, but in 1921 a mostly unheard-­of young man from Arkansas, switching among the six or seven instruments he taught himself to play. The production was forced to rip out seats in the front three rows to make room. These were people used to improvising. Among themselves, they referred to the show as “Scuffle Along.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/magazine/shuffle-along-and-the-painful-history-of-black-performance-in-america.html

It sets up an intriguing dialogue with Noguchi’s art, and there will be exhibitions devoted to other artists in the future, which is a good thing for this museum. Showing only Noguchi’s work year after year doesn’t encourage return visits, and it’s exciting to imagine shows of those who have operated in the fertile cross-cultural space between East and West, artists as varied as Ad Reinhardt and Mariko Mori.

2016-03-25,Face Masks for the Morning — That You Leave on All Day,"The masking hour is, traditionally, a period of required sequestration — a nighttime ritual designed to rebalance your skin in privacy. But a new breed of no-rinse masks can be applied in the morning and left on all day, providing benefits when they’ll actually be visible: the waking hours. Stronger than daily-use creams, and easier to walk around in than sheet masks, the new leave-on-all-day variety is about skin preparation — not restoration. “When you rinse a mask off, that ends your skin’s absorption,” says Tata Harper, whose popular all-natural skin-care line features several no-rinse options. “Leave-on masks extend the time your skin has to absorb benefits.” These formulas are translucent and porous enough to work well with other products, offering a lifted, protected and smoothed-out base for further skin care and makeup. What keeps them within the realm of masks is their potency — most require a brief period to fully absorb and typically aren’t recommended for daily use.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/t-magazine/face-masks-tata-harper-bite-beauty-organic-pharmacy.html

In addition to Venezuela, sponsor countries include Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua.

A dance party with splashes of conga, rumba, mambo and cha-cha, “Club Havana” is the Technicolor version of Cuba — flouncy skirts in rainbow hues, swiveling hips and sly smiles that beckon audiences to visit, which might be possible soon. And now “Club Havana” returns to the Joyce for Ballet Hispanico’s spring season (Tuesday, April 5, through April 10). Filling out the program are Gustavo Ramírez Sansano’s boisterous “Flabbergast” and Ramón Oller’s “Bury Me Standing,” a meditation on Gypsy life and culture set to traditional Eastern European and Spanish popular music. Saturday’s family matinee program offers a sampling of additional repertory from this charismatic company, now marking its 45th anniversary.

2016-03-30,A Legendary Photographer (and McQueen Collaborator) Debuts Paintings,"The photographer Nick Waplington famously captured Alexander McQueen as he prepared his final winter collection, which became the basis for “Working Process,” a show held last year at the Tate. But Waplington’s latest exhibition, “A Display of Panic in a Moment of Absolute Certainty,” opening Saturday at the Los Angeles gallery These Days, contains no snapshots whatsoever — rather, it is comprised solely of paintings and drawings. Much like the McQueen series, which the designer wanted to be “dirty and messy,” Waplington’s new work reveals a constant concern of his 30-year career: an affinity for barely contained chaos, whether in garbage dumps, the hills above the West Bank city of Ramallah or the maelstrom of fashion shows. None of the paintings in the show, Waplington’s first stateside exhibition sans photography, have a single vantage point, a conscious choice to make it “deliberately difficult to perceive order,” he explains. “My paintings deal with this inner world, whereas my photographic work deals with the world around me,” says Waplington, who will appear Thursday in New York at the Rizzoli bookstore alongside Isaac Mizrahi, whose backstage scene he documented every season from 1989 to 1993. “I guess the basic difference is with photography the canvas is full and with painting it’s empty. Both give me problems.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/t-magazine/art/nick-waplington-paintings-fashion-photographer-mcqueen.html

There, the pair debuted a project that builds on, yet departs from, their popular Endgrain series (above left and center), for which they saturated wood blocks with colorful dye, then glued them together to create three-dimensionally patterned furniture.

2016-04-01,"Review: In ‘Afternoon,’ Two Men Open Up","“Recently I’ve been getting this strong feeling that I may be dying soon.” The Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-liang, 58, makes this confession early on in his new picture, the sublimely simple, emotionally charged “Afternoon.” A little over two hours, it documents a fitful conversation between Mr. Tsai and the actor Lee Kang-sheng. About 10 years Mr. Tsai’s junior, Mr. Lee appears in nearly every film Mr. Tsai has made; many of these, including “Goodbye, Dragon Inn” and “What Time Is It There?,” are masterpieces of contemporary Asian cinema.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/afternoon-review-tsai-ming-liang.html

2016-04-01,"Review: ‘Miles Ahead,’ an Impressionistic Take on Miles Davis","There’s a hopped-up scene in “Miles Ahead,” controlled yet frenzied, when you get why Don Cheadle decided to go for broke. He’s playing Miles Davis (he also directed) and the time is the late 1970s — although it’s also the 1960s. Time and space tend to blur in this movie and while the setting is a ’70s boxing match, a couple of figures from Miles’s past — his wife, his younger self — soon swing in to shake things up. She’s running scared and the 1970s Miles is running amok, but the younger Miles, well, there he is, too, playing it cool in the ring. Music is fighting, at least for this pugilist.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/miles-ahead-review-miles-davis.html

2016-04-01,"One Frying Pan, Photographed Over 15 Years","The conceptual photographer Hitoshi Fugo’s series “Flying Frying Pan 1979-1994” has a simple premise: a 15-year study of Fugo’s iron pan. He chose the pan as a subject because he thought it would free him from specifics — of time and place, and even of recognizable shape.

He tackles big, capitalized themes — Power, Art, Virtue, Evil — but his films speak in whispers, murmurs and ruminative pauses. They often feel as intimate and inscrutable as diary entries, even when they deal with monstrous public figures like Hitler, Stalin and Hirohito. Mr. Sokurov forgoes sweeping pictorial gestures and period pageantry in favor of quiet lyricism and tight, sometimes claustrophobic compositions. He thinks a lot about history, and in his best work you can hear history thinking.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/francofonia-review.html

With a partially shaved head and many extra pounds, Mr. Curtis is barely recognizable from his roles in “Whale Rider” and “Once Were Warriors.” The film, directed and written by James Napier Robertson, is inspired by Jim Marbrook’s 2003 documentary, “Dark Horse,” which focused on Mr. Potini, a speed-chess player who died in 2011.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/the-dark-horse-review.html
