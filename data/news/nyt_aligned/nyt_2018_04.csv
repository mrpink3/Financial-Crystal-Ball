Starting in the mid-1980s, Manser, a Swiss traveler, decided to live with the Penan, an indigenous tribe that eventually accepted him as one of its own. After several years with the Penan, Manser became an outspoken critic of deforestation on the island, and he disappeared in 2000, presumed dead. Mr. Palmieri, a Californian, eventually settled in Bali, and from there took a series of trips to Borneo seeking art and artifacts that he sold to museums and collectors. In “The Last Wild Men of Borneo,” Carl Hoffman, himself an adventurer-journalist, tells their stories. Like Manser and Mr. Palmieri, Hoffman has long harbored a fascination with Borneo. Its “forest and its people were the very definition of exotic in the Western mind,” he writes. Mr. Hoffman’s 2014 book, “Savage Harvest,” was an account of the disappearance of Nelson Rockefeller’s son Michael in New Guinea. Below, Mr. Hoffman discusses how that book led to this one, the way his view of his subjects changed over time and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/books/last-wild-men-of-borneo-carl-hoffman-interview.html

She has two choices of medicines to reduce the risk for a second heart attack. There’s Plavix, a tried-and-tested blood thinner, that prevents clot formation; the generic version of the drug costs as little as 25 cents a pill. And there’s Brilinta, a newer medicine that is also effective in clot prevention; it costs about $6.50 a pill — 25 times as much.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/can-doctors-choose-between-saving-lives-and-saving-a-fortune.html

THE BLACK BEAR INSIDE ME By Robin Becker. (Pittsburgh, paper, $15.95.) These lilting, observational poems often invoke music: ballroom dancing, a Beethoven quartet, Scottish songs. One, “Reading Music,” concludes, “I remember when at five the marks on / the page became a story.” CENZONTLE By Marcelo Hernandez Castillo. (BOA Editions, paper, $16.) The title of Castillo’s debut means “mockingbird,” and birds flit in and out of these poems, singing our world back at us. Castillo embraces an expansive ambiguity — of language, of gender, of nationality — that can sound celebratory and mournful at once. EYE LEVEL By Jenny Xie. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) “Funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it,” Xie writes, and the poems in her crystalline debut (with titles including “Rootless,” “Borderless,” “Displacement”) are ever alert to the complex relationship between geography and the self. IS THAT THE SOUND OF A PIANO COMING FROM SEVERAL HOUSES DOWN? By Noah Eli Gordon. (Solid Objects, $20.)

2018-04-03,Letter of Recommendation: ‘House Hunters’,"I cannot watch “Black Mirror” anymore. Its metaphors have grown stale, its winks are now klaxons and its messages — once distorted and eerie — now land with a thud. The same holds true for most so-called “prestige” television, from the violent, misogynist dystopia of “The Handmaid’s Tale” to the violent, misogynist dystopia of “Westworld.” They feel inevitable and manipulative, and watching them does nothing but intensify my already simmering anxieties — which I suspect is the point. So nowadays, when the kitchen is clean and the cats are fed and my brain is on its downward spiral toward sleep, all I want to do is sink into the couch and turn on “House Hunters,” a show about a specific kind of darkness I have complete control in avoiding. It provides all the thrill of a dystopian hellscape with none of the fear.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-house-hunters.html

He and his wife, Adrienne Pace, left New York to travel and returned to find the city welcoming a spicier, more global, vegetable-based cuisine and Mr. Pace’s former landlord “ready to deal,” as he put it.

Hefty sandwiches on bread that’s gluten-free or not, salads and main courses (served after noon) that include skirt steak, mac and cheese and leg of lamb with kofta seasonings, round out a menu that unites comfort food and Middle Eastern seasoning.

2018-04-05,Review: ‘Chappaquiddick’ Revisits a Grim ’60s Kennedy Scandal,"I admit that I approached “Chappaquiddick” with a measure of skepticism and a tremor of dread. The ongoing, morbid fascination with all things Kennedy is an aspect of American culture I find perplexing and somewhat dispiriting.

The lives and deaths of Kennedy family members provide grist for endless conspiracy theorizing, tabloid salaciousness, celebrity-worship and superstition. A movie about one of the sadder, tawdrier episodes in the saga could only feed this syndrome.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/movies/chappaquiddick-review.html

It’s been a lament since at least 1871, when A.&P., probably the earliest national chain, opened its first store outside New York.

This is true even of works intended mainly for children, a category that includes — let’s be honest — most of the superhero sagas that dominate pop culture’s most lucrative precincts. I’m not complaining, by the way (I love comics too), just observing. But picture books are another story. Even the genius likes of Beatrix Potter and Maurice Sendak are shunted off to the critical equivalent of the Thanksgiving kids’ table, smiled at but not often engaged with. Yet the best picture books, far from being baby food, display a pictorial sophistication that puts many graphic novels to shame; think of them as visual haiku, an art form of juxtaposition and implication, bright colors notwithstanding. And here are three examples to prove the point — books full of surface delight that also reward close reading. Kids might love them, but I’m guessing all three will resonate even more with grown-ups.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/books/review/i-got-it-david-wiesner.html

Named after the pleasure gardens of 18th-century London — cradles of art, society and sex — the biannual British publication was conceived in 2017 to reframe the narrative around gardens and plants. “I wanted to do a magazine that didn’t tell people how to prune and grow things, but to delight in the art of the garden,” says John Tebbs, the magazine’s editor in chief and a professional gardener for 15 years. To that end, the third issue of Pleasure Garden is a 200-page rumination on the rose. One article unpacks the myth of a rose-loving empress, another captures a flower-filled parade during the Portland Rose Festival and a third visits the artist Robert Tatin’s eccentric concrete sculpture garden in Northwest France. “There is so much beauty within gardens and the natural world that I am never short of inspiration,” says Tebbs.

The director George Stevens’s film, starring Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, and based on Edna Ferber’s 1952 novel of the same name, was released in 1956. It earned Stevens an Oscar and was nominated in several other categories, including Best Picture. (It lost to “Around the World in 80 Days.”) Don Graham’s new book tells the story of how this epic about the ranching life, the oil business, clashing cultures and the changing fortunes of generations made it to the screen. Below, Mr. Graham, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin, discusses how his students’ reaction to the movie helped inspire the book, how Stevens’s experiences during World War II influenced the film and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/books/giant-don-graham-interview.html

The harsh reality of his New York City childhood would later become paramount to his work — black-and-white photography, Super 8 films, paintings — stripping away the layers of civil society to reveal modern culture in all its raw brutality: the hypocrisy of government and religion, the marginalization gay people faced during the Reagan era. But his personal artifacts, many of which are now archived at N.Y.U.’s Fales Library & Special Collections along with his work, reveal Wojnarowicz’s humorous side, including an assembly of Halloween ornaments and decorations cataloged after his death in 1992. “He had over 400 objects in the collection,” says Marvin J. Taylor, the director of Fales. “He managed to hold on to everything despite moving around a lot throughout his life.” A retrospective of Wojnarowicz’s work opens July 13 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Most famously, Ingrid Bergman was 32 when she portrayed the 16-to-19-year-old Joan in a 1948 film.

It’s an amorphous term, redolent of Chex cereal or disco floors or cocktail bars, and not easy to define in the context of books journalism. But this week’s recommended titles offer a perfect illustration of the concept: On the surface, these eight books have little in common, but taken together they add up to a broad snapshot of life today. One novel looks at gun culture; another explores how feminism has changed over the years. There’s the memoir of a woman raised among survivalists, and a look at the Syrian civil war, and a deep investigative dive into the 2016 presidential election and possible Russian interference. Less topical, but still fascinating, is Yunte Huang’s thorough history of the 19th-century conjoined twins Chang and Eng.

The dry restraint favored by someone like Annie-B Parson couldn’t be further from Graham’s effusive theatricality, yet the troupe thrived in Ms. Parson’s “The Snow Falls in the Winter” in 2015. One of the most successful “Lamentation Variations” (reinventions of Graham’s 1930 “Lamentation”) was a 2012 iteration by Yvonne Rainer, who, as a founder of the 1960s collective Judson Dance Theater, rejected much of what Graham and her cohort championed.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/arts/dance/review-martha-graham-dance-company-city-center.html

But this wasn’t any kind of self-hatred thing.” Ms. Thompson-Spires was inspired by James McCune Smith, a 19th-century abolitionist and doctor whose brief stories about various characters were published under the title “Heads of the Colored People, Done With a Whitewash Brush.” In an author’s note, Ms. Thompson-Spires writes that, like the work of Smith and some of his contemporaries, including William J. Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in “black U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.” Below, she discusses her surprise at the tone that has developed in her work, the way she was inspired by stand-up comedians in the 1990s and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/books/heads-of-the-colored-people-nafissa-thompson-spires-interview.html

2018-04-16,How Hip-Hop Transformed New York,"ON VALENTINE’S DAY 1981 Deborah Harry was the headlining musical guest on “Saturday Night Live.” A product of the fertile downtown Manhattan musical scene, centered around the CBGB club on the Bowery, she had gone pop with a series of hit singles, including Blondie’s “Rapture,” which reached No. 1 in 1981. The track, a tribute to an uptown musical culture that most Americans viewed as a curiosity or fad (if they had any awareness of it at all), name-checked a few seminal New York figures, including Grandmaster Flash, the pioneering D.J. whose group the Furious Five formed in 1976 and broke musical ground at house parties in the South Bronx before cracking into the Top 100 in 1982 with the socially conscious rap anthem “The Message,” and Fab 5 Freddy, a Brooklyn-based graffiti artist who acted as a liaison between street artists, the commercial art world and downtown clubs. At the urging of Blondie’s Harry and the band’s guitarist Chris Stein, “S.N.L.” booked the Bronx’s Funky 4 + 1 (four male rappers and pioneering female M.C. Sha-Rock) to perform their single “That’s the Joint” for the show’s final number of the night. Harry’s rapped verse on “Rapture” was, for most people, a proxy introduction to hip-hop, but it was the Funky 4 + 1 that gave network television viewers the first true taste of what young New Yorkers had been experiencing in parks, subways and schoolyards for several years already.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/t-magazine/hip-hop-music-1980s.html

It was a career move suggested by Diana Vreeland, the former editor of American Vogue who was by then a curator to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in Manhattan. “I wanted to design textiles,” the 79-year-old Herrera recalls. “I came to see Diana, and I told her my story and asked whether she liked the idea or not. And she said, ‘My God, that’s very boring. Why don’t you do something else, connected with fashion? Why don’t you do a collection?’ ” So she did. It was around 20 outfits, on a group of models corralled with help from her friend, the designer Bill Blass. It was shown at the Metropolitan Club, an august private social club founded in 1891 by J.P. Morgan and housed on New York’s East 60th Street — the first time the venue had permitted a fashion show within its walls. Musicians played Cole Porter.

As a particularly despised group of people, queers were fighting police brutality on one front and racist admission policies in gay and lesbian bars on the other, homophobia at home and the closet at work. At the time, there was still no gay rights bill in the city, and sodomy was illegal in more than half of the states.

But not until the early ’80s did it begin appearing with merciless persistence at restaurants across Manhattan, in tart after tart, fruit salads, compotes and even savory dishes, lending an algal tinge to beurre blanc. By 1983, it was stocked in every supermarket and featured in recipes on the back of cake-mix boxes.

Dealers like Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend and Mary Boone championed artists such as David Salle and Julian Schnabel, whom critics labeled Neo-Expressionists, and whose style appealed to a growing art market willing to pay large sums of money for young painters. But just a few blocks and a world away — in the East Village — a smaller but no less important community of galleries was emerging as well, a kind of conceptual and anti-commercial satellite orbiting the art world’s mainstream.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/t-magazine/east-village-artist-jeff-koons-peter-halley.html

But the song was more deeply about a famed Manhattan boundary, one insurmountable at the time: “Uptown” was shorthand for the well-lit East Side corridor where nouvelle society, powered by the Wall Street boom, resided in splendor. “Downtown” was the shadowy province beneath 14th Street — a countercultural warren of tenement walk-ups and industrial loft spaces.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/t-magazine/interior-design-1980s.html

2018-04-17,When Models Became as Famous as the Artists they Inspired,"One of the earliest appearances of the muses was in a narrative poem called “Theogony” by the Greek poet Hesiod, who wrote around 700 B.C. that they were nine sisters born of Zeus and his lover Mnemosyne, or memory. Of them he wrote, “they plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice.” Homer invoked the muse for his epic poem (“Sing to me of the man, Muse”) as did Virgil. Over time, the muse became a less incantatory figure and more of a sexual one: The word is commonly used, for example, as a shorthand for the many wives and lovers Pablo Picasso captured in his work. With the rise of the model as celebrity in the latter half of the 20th century, the muse became more objectified. She could be the woman a fashion designer trusted to wear his clothes, both on and off the runway. Or she could be a figure of whom a world-famous photographer’s lens never tired. These women and their looks — from Misia Sert’s bohemian opulence at the turn of the last century to Twiggy’s sprightly boyishness in the 1960s — can be as much an expression of their times as their era’s music, literature or even politics.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/t-magazine/muses-1980s-patti-hansen-farida-khelfa.html

Dinner on the Upper East Side with a former president of the United States. These are the moments, large and small, recounted by 36 writers, artists, fashion designers, musicians and more who lived in New York City in the early ’80s. Together, this chorus of voices — assembled, edited and condensed — creates a compelling mosaic, revealing a city bustling with creativity but also slowly emerging from its recent near-bankruptcy, with upscale restaurants just blocks away from rubble-filled, graffiti-painted lots.

Both had begun in the 1600s as colonial farmland; by the 19th century, both had transformed into a shopping and entertainment district, with large hotels, upscale department stores, theaters and hundreds of brothels. After the Civil War, the area became an important manufacturing center for textile firms and other industries, and the brothels were gradually replaced by clusters of cast-iron warehouses. By the 1950s, these warehouses were mostly being used for storage or sweatshops, and the neighborhood, increasingly decrepit, earned the nickname Hell’s Hundred Acres.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/t-magazine/soho-artists-john-newman-laurie-anderson.html

And while it has been reported that “DAMN.” was the unanimous choice of the Pulitzer music jury, the award was met in other quarters with disgruntlement and even outrage. Here, Zachary Woolfe, the classical music editor of The New York Times, and Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic, discuss the choice.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-music-pulitzer-prize-damn.html

Four years ago she created Lumos Bar on Houston Street, specializing in baijiu, with Orson Salicetti, a baijiu lover, behind the bar. Now she is opening Lumos Kitchen because she and Mr. Salicetti felt they had to serve more food. “Baijiu is usually drunk with food,” Ms. Li said. (She has since closed Lumos Bar, replacing it with Railways, a gastro pub.) Hok Chin, a Hong Kong native and a veteran of some of New York’s French kitchens, including at the Essex House and the Mark Hotel, fuses French and Chinese cuisine, in dishes like pan-seared quail with foie gras in a Chinese wine sauce, black bass glazed with baijiu-miso sauce, wok-fried tiger prawns, and foie gras fried rice. To go alongside, Mr. Salicetti has come up with cocktails like a sesame colada with mangosteen, and the El Paso, combining baijiu with Lillet, lime, Sichuan pepper, cucumber and cilantro. His bar is stocked with more than 30 baijius, including some infused with herbs in-house. The airy restaurant, with splashy blue leaves decorating the walls, has a semi-open kitchen: 188 Second Avenue (12th Street), no phone, lumoskitchen.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/dining/lumos-kitchen-nyc-restaurant-news.html

Walker Evans contributed a preface to the 1960 reissue of “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” the study of poor tenant farmers in Alabama, originally published in 1941; “Walker” crops up a number of times in James Agee’s text, but a formal separation is maintained between the tenderly austere photographs of families and their homes — printed at the beginning — and the 400 pages of Agee’s highly wrought, much-agonized-over text. This, for Gore Vidal, was no bad thing, because it left Evans’s “austere” photos untainted by what “good-hearted, soft-headed admirers of the Saint James (Agee) version” so loved about the sharecroppers’ gospel.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/magazine/the-magic-of-books-where-photography-meets-essays.html

Lowering his razor, he lifted his chin to see if the lima-bean-size lump was still visible on the right side of his neck, just under his jawbone. His fingers quickly found the small double-lobed bulge. When he first saw it, while shaving maybe a couple of weeks earlier, it was a little tender. The soreness had gone away, but still, the lump made him nervous. Years ago, a friend had found a lump near her collarbone and ended up dying of cancer. He was due for his yearly physical, so he made an appointment to see his doctor. It was probably nothing — but he wanted to hear it from a professional.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/magazine/why-wouldt-the-lump-under-the-patients-jaw-go-away.html

And not because the setup lacks drama: The true story of Susette Kelo’s yearslong battle to save her waterfront home in a declining Connecticut town would conclude in the U.S. Supreme Court.

2018-04-19,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"With this week’s selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city’s rich photographic heritage — surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century’s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers — whose new novel, “The Overstory,” is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts — and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of “The Silence of the Lambs.” And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen’s “High-Risers,” about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It’s not a happy story, but it’s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

Start with the name, which alludes to the notion of taking a former bar space, in this case Whiskey Social, and giving it new life. “We’ve kept as much of the stuff that was here as possible,” said Dave Arnold, the avant-garde cocktail master who is in partnership with Don Lee, another drinks innovator, and Greg Boehm, who founded Cocktail Kingdom, which makes and sells barware and books. They will serve some beers and wines, and can stir a proper martini, but that’s beside the point. Their drinks are listed as nonalcoholic (sophisticated, at times sparkling, and priced at $15, the same as the alcoholic selections), carbonated, shaken, stirred straight up or on a big rock. Those in a hurry can buy bottled cocktails from vending machines with a $15 token. The ingredients they use are often extracted in a centrifuge or chilled with liquid nitrogen. But aside from such techniques, the cocktails are simple and focused, not assembled with a pantryload of components like many concoctions these days. “These drinks are all flavor-driven,” Mr. Arnold said. Mr. Lee added that they intended to show off ingredients in drinks like the delicious nonalcoholic Doyenne with clarified Comice pear juice, the fresh-tasting OG Celery with gin and a blast of celery, and the satisfying Professor Plum, which is like an old-fashioned with prune-infused bourbon.

The show was peculiar and raw, once described by O’Brien as “sub-realism,” in reference to its unfiltered, anarchic flow. Episodes were directed by the underground filmmaker Amos Poe in a small Manhattan studio using cheap rental equipment, but the guests were well known — or soon would be. The musicians Iggy Pop, George Clinton and Debbie Harry, as well as the artists Robert Mapplethorpe, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Chris Burden all made appearances, starring in improvised performances, mumbled interviews and a call-in segment consisting mostly of stray insults, scattered fan support and the recurring question, “What is this all about?”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/t-magazine/fashion/tv-party-1980s-style-glenn-obrien.html

Early on, someone menacingly (and presciently) says, “You may think this is suffering. No: It’s salvation.” That’s a bit overstated either way. It’s puzzlement and irritation and also, yes, delight. But of course this film, the 19th installment in a series, was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation.

2018-04-26,Review: ‘Let the Sunshine In’ Shows the Complex Radiance of Juliette Binoche,"In the first scene of “Let the Sunshine In,” Isabelle, a Parisian artist, is in bed with one of her lovers, a portly, ginger-bearded banker named Vincent. He is quite impressed with his amatory skills, which makes one of them. The scene — tender, awkward, comical — is candid but not graphic, the vibe less voyeuristic than analytical. What people say and do while they’re having sex is revealing, not only of their bodies but also of their feelings, egos and motivations. So if we want to know who Isabelle is and what she’s like — the principal concern of Claire Denis’s shrewd and uncompromising new film — then the bedroom might be as good a place as any to start.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/movies/let-the-sunshine-in-review-juliette-binoche.html

It doesn’t seem especially airless at first, when Ronit is seen taking a portrait of a tattooed, bare-chested, much-older gent. They’re in a nice, roomy studio, and as he poses, she teasingly speaks to him about smiling, a nonchalant exchange that telegraphs some of this story’s larger concerns.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/movies/disobedience-review-rachel-mcadams.html

In those days I was an ambitious cook — I’d shop at Balducci’s on Sixth Avenue, where you could get exotic things like white eggplant and dazzle your guests. My most famous guest was Michel Foucault, who once told me he was going to come over with 10 boys he’d picked up, but who didn’t know each other. I was afraid they’d have nothing to say to each other and that it would be a disaster.

2018-04-27,Listen to the Early ’80s: Two Playlists Inspired by Our Culture Issue,"In late 1979, when the D.J. Justin Strauss first brought a bag of records to spin at the Mudd Club, the downtown New York City bar that’s now the stuff of underground lore, the term “disc jockey” didn’t mean much yet — and it certainly didn’t evoke celebrity status. “It wasn’t anything that anyone thought about — I didn’t think about it,” Strauss says now. “I didn’t wake up and go, ‘I want to be a D.J.’ It just sort of happened naturally.” He had left New York, his hometown, to live in Los Angeles with his power-pop group Milk ’n’ Cookies. The band eventually split and his then-girlfriend persuaded him to come back to the city. “She said, ‘You gotta come. This club opened up and you’d be great to play your records there,’” he remembers. This was the era of the slick, moneyed glamour of Studio 54, and the Mudd Club was, in many ways, a reaction to it. “There were no rules — you could play a rockabilly song next to a rap song or a reggae song or the Buzzcocks or whatever it was — it all made sense and everyone danced,” he said. As for the crowd, it “was just a mix of downtown kids, artists … Keith Haring, Jean-Michel [Basquiat].” Strauss spent the rest of the decade spinning at big — and now shuttered — clubs like Area, the Ritz, Tunnel and Limelight. He ultimately began remixing and producing original tracks; he still D.J.s around the world and has a show on the Lot Radio, based in Brooklyn.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/t-magazine/80s-playlists-justin-strauss-black-madonna-dj.html
