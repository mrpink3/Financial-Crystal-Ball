As a teenager, too broke to buy drugs, Dunn later joked, she would sometimes try to catch bugs in order to get high. Dunn’s mother beat her; once, she threw a screwdriver that punctured Dunn’s calf, leaving a lifelong scar. When Dunn was 17, she left home for good. After a brief stint in jail for attempting to pass a bad check, she enrolled in Reed College. She fell in love, dropped out of Reed and traveled around the world before returning to Portland to raise her son, Eli. She cobbled together jobs, wrapping candy on assembly lines and posing nude for life-drawing classes. She also waited tables and bartended at dive bars where she dodged biker-gang fights.

Bad actors notwithstanding, the real art world is “a great broken beautiful family of misfits,” according to one of the essays that earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 2018. “I refuse to believe that this spirit has left the art world, even though I recognize that this exquisite internal essence can be buried under loads of external bull——.” This devotional verve suffuses the articles, reviews, obits and interviews collected in “Art Is Life: Icons & Iconoclasts, Visionaries & Vigilantes, & Flashes of Hope in the Night.” Published between 1999 and 2021, they collectively form a love letter to the art that, for Saltz, makes all the wheeling and dealing worth putting up with.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/books/review/jerry-saltz-art-is-life.html

2022-11-01,Tell Me Something Bad About Tulsa,"It’s not news that the United States has a long history of enslaving, torturing and killing Black people. A particular method, for lack of a better word, thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — targeted efforts by white mobs to violently destroy Black communities. In 1919, there were so many attacks between May and August alone that the writer James Weldon Johnson termed it “The Red Summer.” In 1923, the community of Rosewood, Fla., was razed; and the list goes on, with far too many such tragedies to cite here. But since 2019’s HBO hit “Watchmen,” only one of these massacres has become a cultural shorthand: the Tulsa massacre of 1921, in which thousands of white people stormed the city’s Greenwood district and burned it to the ground, killing an estimated 300 African Americans and leaving thousands homeless.

I happened to live in these parts for three years, and I crossed the overpass twice a day most days.

The patient, a 62-year-old man, had a chest CT earlier that day, and Dr. David Smith, his longtime P.C.P., was telling him that the radiologist saw a mass. It sounded bad, but it probably wasn’t cancer, Smith told him. “I didn’t want you to see the report and worry,” he added. The report said that the mass in his lungs looked like a neoplasm — the fancy word for tumor.

Or rather: A Swedish actor playing Ek sits in front of a Senate hearing, as imagined by a Swedish production designer. A fictitious senator named Landy is grilling him, hard. “Your business model just doesn’t work for musicians, does it?” she asks. Her tone makes it obvious that she already knows the answer Ek would give if he were willing to tell the truth. As she peppers him with facts and figures about Spotify’s market share and artists’ measly cut of its revenue, Ek tries to fight back, insisting that his streaming service, whatever its shortcomings, is still the best path forward for musicians hoping to make a living from their art. But the more Landy presses, the more shaken Ek looks, as though he didn’t expect the questioning to be so tough. There is a moment in which it seems he might be considering the possibility that her criticisms have merit: Maybe, despite all of his company’s rhetoric about freedom for artists, he really is just a new breed of music-industry monopolist.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/magazine/the-playlist-netflix-spotify.html

In the penultimate stanza of this poem, the imperative appears for the first time, as if the speaker is reminding himself to stay true to himself, despite external pressures to be like everyone else or the “twelve identical bridges,” likely a metaphor for silence. The “traffic” returns in the final stanza, with a slight ray of hope amid loneliness and displacement.

2022-11-07,"In This Novel, Teenage Artists Spawn a Deadly Moral Panic","These days, teenagers of the 1990s find themselves in the bizarre position of having to conjure their childhoods as if they had taken place in the 1890s. Is life before smartphones really so alien? American teens still drive around with their nascent licenses, listening to questionable music, eating Pop-Tarts from gas stations (possibly, chillingly, the same Pop-Tarts). More important, they still develop intense and thrilling friendships. In his fourth novel, “Now Is Not the Time To Panic,” Kevin Wilson (best known for “Nothing to See Here” and “The Family Fang”) addresses the contours of this liminal time, capturing the still-relevant feeling of trying “to remember what was in the cassette player, if it was cool.” His is a buoyant tribute to small-town life, a book about creativity and creation in a world before “send” buttons.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/books/review/kevin-wilson-now-is-not-the-time-to-panic.html

2022-11-07,Le Bernardin Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary,"In a business known for its short shelf life, a restaurant like Le Bernardin turning 50 is significant. The owners, Maguy Le Coze and the chef, Eric Ripert, have planned a dinner to mark the occasion. Ms. Le Coze and her brother, Gilbert, first opened their seafood restaurant in 1972 on the Left Bank in Paris, with a view of Notre Dame, then relocated the restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe. They made the trans-Atlantic move to the present location in New York in 1986, as an anchor in a collection of restaurants in a new office tower on Seventh Avenue. The restaurant received four stars in its first New York Times review, three months after opening, a top ranking it has maintained over decades. In Paris it received two stars from Michelin, but was never awarded the ultimate three. (Mr. Le Coze contended that it was because they only served fish.) When Michelin introduced its New York guide in 2005, the restaurant finally achieved the third star. It was a pinnacle that Mr. Le Coze was unable to enjoy: He died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1994. Ms. Le Coze kept the restaurant going with Mr. Ripert, who became her partner in the restaurant. To mark the anniversary they have organized a $1,000 per person six-course dinner on Wednesday with 10 percent going to the charity City Harvest, which Mr. Ripert supports. The menu combines echoes of Le Bernardin classics, like the pounded tuna first course; and monkfish with a sunchoke purée replacing melted leeks. (Mr. Le Coze is often credited with popularizing monkfish for the American audience.) In recent years, Le Bernardin has always been at or near the top of global restaurant awards.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/dining/le-bernardin-anniversary.html

So it’s still an appropriate home base for this venerable Paris brasserie, now with a global presence. It’s managed by Groupe Barrière, whose hotels often house a Fouquet’s. Built into the Hotel Barrière Fouquet’s New York, the ground-floor brasserie is brightly elegant, done with Art Deco details, glittering chandeliers, red leather upholstery, brass trim and white tablecloths. Pierre Gagnaire, whose work at Saint-Étienne in Paris has earned him three Michelin stars, is supervising the menu. The executive chef, Bradley Stellings, who worked with Alain Ducasse and his second-in-command, Didier Elena, said that Mr. Gagnaire’s signature, typically a refreshing touch of citrus, could be found in a number of traditional dishes, even the French onion soup. Count on oysters, escargots, caviar service, lobster fricassee, chicken paillard, a salmon casserole with Champagne, and, for dessert, the signature mille-feuille and profiteroles. Sharing the hotel lobby is Par Ici Cafe, for more casual Mediterranean fare in an indoor-outdoor setting with a garden. There are also several bars throughout.

Greenidge delves into with her history “The Grimkes,” or exploring a dynasty of merchants who shaped modern capitalism and sat among the ruling class for generations, as Joseph Sassoon writes about in his family history, “The Sassoons.” It’s true in Andrew Miller’s novel “The Slowworm’s Song,” about a (complicated) father trying to make amends with his daughter, and in Jenny Xie’s poetry collection “The Rupture Tense,” which grapples with her family’s experiences in the Cultural Revolution and her own (complicated) feelings about the Asian diaspora.

Shawky, 51, had been conducting a large amount of research on the topic for a film he’s making in Italy and Egypt on Greco-Roman beliefs. This immersion has, in turn, inspired new projects, including his latest show, “Isles of the Blessed,” which opens today at the Lisson Gallery in New York City. When we met last month, he had just returned to the United States, where he spends parts of the year, to finalize works for the exhibition.

2022-11-11,"Why the Showy, Short-Lived Hibiscus Is the Flower of Our Time","“COLLECTING CAN BE a sort of lovesickness,” Susan Orlean writes in 1998’s “The Orchid Thief”: “If you collect living things, you are pursuing something imperfectible, because even if you manage to find and possess the living things you want, there is no guarantee they won’t die or change.” Orlean is, of course, writing about orchids and the people obsessed with them, but she could also have been talking about the growers, hybridizers, collectors and floral designers who are ardent about tropical hibiscus — the large, showy pinwheel-shaped flower that comes in a spectacular array of colors. “It’s almost like tulip fever, though in a much more low-key way,” says the floral artist Brittany Asch, 35, about the resurgent interest in tropical hibiscus, the persnickety plant that’s traumatized by frost and frazzled by too much heat, and whose blooms are known to last, poetically, for a single day. Asch, who moved her New York-based studio, Brrch, to Los Angeles in late 2020 and has used the flower in her dreamy, lyrical arrangements, says that because florists in, say, Miami or Hawaii have better access to tropical hibiscuses than their counterparts in New York, this creates an “element of exclusivity” — compounded, perhaps, by the brief life of the blossoms — that renders them even more desirable.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/t-magazine/hibiscus-flowers.html

Among the roughly 50 pieces, which were inspired by the celestial floor mosaics at Aubazine Abbey (she’d lived at the Cistercian monastery’s orphanage as a child), were bracelets that coiled around the wrist like comet tails, a brooch shaped like a shimmering crescent and necklaces with diamonds arrayed to evoke the Big Dipper. “I wanted to cover women with constellations. With stars! Stars of all sizes,” said Chanel, whose bijouterie, like her pioneering clothing designs, was defined by an elegant yet restrained simplicity: Diamonds were cut and faceted using traditional techniques, and each stone’s setting was rendered to appear completely invisible.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/t-magazine/chanel-comet-ring.html

Black people love to talk about what’s Blacker than what or who’s Blacker than who because, for many of us, Blackness is more than an ethnicity; it’s a religion we love to praise. “Atlanta” took the notion of a racial test to the nth degree, in a way that was funny but also loving.

Its soft pompom tail shrunk to half its size like a melting snowball. The scratched plastic eyes deepened and grew wise; the left eye loosened and eventually fell off. When Noah first told me L.F.’s name, I thought he’d said “Alef,” like the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. I thought he’d named it after an ancient scratch, the beginning of something that has, as far as we know, no end. The last time I remember seeing L.F., he was more story than bunny, more memory than animal: the well-loved thing knocked, and snipped, and cracked, and thinned enough for new light to shine through.

The group will open its newest property, Eastwind Oliverea Valley, in the area this January. It joins the ranks of hotels like Wildflower Farms and Inness in the rejuvenation of the mountainous stretch of upstate New York that’s just a short drive away from the city. Oliverea Valley’s 30 accommodations — a mix of free-standing A-frame cabins and stylish guest rooms in a central building — mark the first time the brand, which also operates hotels in Windham and Lake Placid, has “started from scratch,” says Boyer. The interiors are inspired by the Scandinavian sentiment of hygge, with wood furnishings, gently worn rugs and sheepskin throws. Just 25 miles away is another newcomer: Hotel Lilien, an 18-room boutique hotel and cocktail bar designed by the San Francisco-based firm Field Theory in collaboration with the Lost Boys Hospitality Group, which opened for weekend stays in August but will be fully bookable starting Dec. 1. The hotel features a mix of furnishings that pay homage to the original 1890s architecture of the property. Think “a blue-green Wes Anderson-esque reception nook, Huey sconces, Mulberry duck motif wallpaper, a black-and-white checkered tumbled marble entry floor and antique Persian rugs,” all of which took “over a year” to hunt down, said Leah Harmatz, founder and principal designer at Field Theory. “We layered in pieces from different eras, just as someone who lived in a home over many decades would slowly amass an inspired and meaningful collection of furniture and art.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/t-magazine/sies-marjans-john-waters-nick-cave-cashmere.html

2022-11-21,"In Morocco, a Hotel That Offers the Luxury of Peace and Quiet","In the early ’90s, Fabrizio Ruspoli di Poggio Suasa, a French Italian aristocrat from Paris and a former dealer in 18th-century French furniture, moved to Marrakesh. Ruspoli, who grew up visiting his grandmother in Morocco, quickly felt at home among the city’s well-known expats — among them at the time the interior designer Bill Willis, the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé — and soon purchased the popular French restaurant La Maison Arabe, transforming it into the medina’s first riad hotel. But in the three decades since his arrival, says Ruspoli, Marrakesh has, for better and worse, grown “along with the noise of scooters.” So three years ago, he decided to sell the hotel to seek a quieter life about an hour’s drive outside of town in the Atlas Mountains. But not too quiet: This fall, Ruspoli and his longtime partner, José Abete, opened a new property, Olinto, in the lush Ouirgane Valley. Set on 10 acres planted with olive groves and fragrant gardens, the hotel has dramatic views of the red earth mountains, with nine vine-covered guesthouses with rooftop sitting areas, private gardens and, in some cases, pools. A spa will open sometime next year, but for now, guests can lounge on the many wisteria-lined terraces and enjoy massages in the traditional hammam. Ruspoli, who says he was “born playing a piano,” named his new project in honor of his like-minded ancestor Marquis Francesco Maria Ruspoli, a patron of Handel, who adopted the moniker Olinto, after a village in ancient Greece, as part of his membership in a musical and literary society called the Academy of Arcadia. “My hope is to host something similar here: a retreat and, eventually, a small music festival surrounded by my gardens,” he says.

And as comprehensive as this book might be, there is no recipe index and almost no reference to buying organic, though “sustainably sourced” is advised for seafood and eggs.

2022-11-22,The Colombian Architect Who Reimagined Modernism for a New Era,"IN THE YEARS before his death in 2007 at the age of 80, the Colombian architect Rogelio Salmona would guide students through the house that he and his second wife, the architect María Elvira Madriñán, had built for themselves in the rural hill country north of Bogotá. From the top of the gently sloped 6.3-acre lot, they would follow a wide brick path under a canopy of native chicalá and guayacán trees to its end at a solitary brick lintel hung with dangling ferns. Through the threshold, they would enter the first of the house’s three courtyards, square enclosures staggered along a diagonal and sutured together by a brick canal, a furrow in the ground’s otherwise flat pavers, and ending in a fountain. In the second patio, they would climb a staircase that spread to a roofscape of catwalks and barrel vaults, eventually descending to the final terrace and out again into the garden that Salmona and Madriñán, now 67, had spent more than a decade planting before they laid the house’s first brick. Only after circumambulating the 1,625-square-foot house, named Casa Río Frío for the stream that bounds the property to the east, and only if his visitors insisted, would Salmona take them inside for a perfunctory tour of its monastic interiors: its two baths and three bedrooms, its kitchen and living room and studio, built in concrete, granadillo wood and, most of all, brick.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/t-magazine/rogelio-salmona-bogota-colombia-architecture.html

But before all of that, there was honey. The first thing Christiansen — the founder of the ad agency Chandelier Creative — did upon moving to his densely vegetated seven-acre property in Los Angeles’s Highland Park in 2016 was establish some beehives. As a child in rural Australia, he had been surrounded by his parents’ hives: “It’s just this timeless, beautiful thing that everyone can do,” he says. Earlier this year, Christiansen installed hives in the gardens of a few famous friends and fans of Flamingo Estate, with all proceeds from the resulting honey sold this holiday season going to a number of charities, including Cancer for College and Refugees International. In southern Portugal, the artist Ai Weiwei’s bees are feasting on olive trees. Will Ferrell, Tiffany Haddish and LeBron and Savannah James have hives in different parts of Los Angeles, and Julianne Moore has been hosting hers in Montauk, on Long Island. “These bees are like my children, so I only wanted them to go to the best places,” Christiansen says. (His own swarm was used for the Los Angeles sites; elsewhere, he relied on trusted local apiarists.) Going forward, he plans to introduce his bees to other fabulous gardens. As he sees it, it’s a kind of vacation for these industrious insects. “These bees wake up,” he says, “and they fly out to the most amazing view.” From $250, flamingoestate.com. — Ella Riley-Adams",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/t-magazine/flamingo-estate-honey.html

2022-11-22,"Jupiter, From the King Team, Opens in Rockefeller Center","As Clare de Boer, an owner of King in the West Village, put it, Jupiter is another way of saying king. And, at this new Rockefeller Center restaurant, the name presides over an expanded realm. Seating spills into the concourse area, past the U-shaped space. Even the kitchen itself gives Ms. de Boer and her partners, Jess Shadbolt and Annie Shi, and the executive chef, Gaz Herbert, more to work with. “With our limited kitchen at King, we could only serve one pasta per day,” Ms. de Boer said. The opening menu at Jupiter lists eight, with snacks like fried zucchini; antipasti, including crab toast; and a meat and fish main course, all with an eye to much of Italy, notably Venice. The seafood risotto comes brothy, all’onda. Ms. Shi’s wine list tilts Italian, exclusively so by the glass. Tablecloths are on full display at Jupiter, as they are at King. Light fixtures vaguely suggesting eclipses glow throughout. The stretch of marble bar segues into an open kitchen that divides the space. The restaurant is open from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., weekdays only for now. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

All-day California fare is served in the lobby lounge, cafe and bar; the Pool Lounge offers complimentary refreshments like lemonade and candy; and on the mezzanine floor, you’ll find a sake bar with Japanese-fusion small plates like pressed sushi and a chicken katsu sandwich — with an accompanying late-night takeout window.

2022-11-28,A Tall Vase Inspired by Bodega Flower Stands,"The ceramist Reinaldo Sanguino became obsessed with clay as a boy in Caracas, Venezuela, where he would go down to the river and shape the mud with his hands.

Sanguino, who often starts with a simple hand-built or wheel-thrown clay form, makes stools, hanging wall pieces and tables, as well as monumental vessels, in his Long Island City, Queens, studio, then transforms the material with a glazing process to produce one-of-a-kind creations characterized by saturated shocks of colors, metallic glimmers and hints of oatmeal, with knotted or stitched-together pieces of fabric, yarn or burlap for texture. This two-foot-tall vase, which suggests an amphora, has craggy holes on the sides for branches or blossoms; unlike some art potters, he intends for most of his work, however precious, to be used. “I’m inspired by the rough beauty of bodega flower stands, which are staffed by immigrants,” he says. “The point is always to be real.” The Other Series vase, $10,000, thefutureperfect.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/t-magazine/reinaldo-sanguino-vase.html

Fine for paper. Book pages. But not fine for packaging, because for packaging, you need the long fibers. A pine will give you that.

I imagined deep conversations about law professors and law-firm culture, and sharing how I’ve learned to navigate them as a Black woman. Not only will these conversations not apply to my mentee the same way, but I can’t help wondering if assisting them will ultimately contribute to my own oppression. There are so many factors in her favor that I don’t really want to help give her even more of a leg up in my free time.

He did, however, enjoy making things, working with his father to lash together a child-size crossbow from spare pieces of wood or sewing a pair of fingerless gloves in homage to “Bad”-era Michael Jackson. After completing his degree in industrial design at the Media and Design Academy in Genk and following a stint as a runway model for the fashion designer Raf Simons (who had also studied in Genk), Verheyden, now 44, began making handbags from a studio in his hometown. In 2007, he moved into a 1,600-square-foot townhouse in the center of the city with his wife, Saartje Vereecke, 46; together, they established a design firm under his name that sells objects like precisely tailored leather place mats and minimalist furnishings such as solid oak stools.

Torrisi 2.0 is now Torrisi Bar & Restaurant, grander, layered with atmosphere with a 35-seat bar area that faces a swath of open kitchen, and a 40-seat dining room with a geometric marble floor and tablecloths beyond. The menu’s take on Italian American is not cookie-cutter red sauce, the group has the Parm restaurants for that; here the food has a strong New York focus. Stuffed peppers, hand-pulled mozzarella, linguine with Manhattan clams, tortellini pomodoro, cucumbers New Yorkese, short ribs with pastrami spices and, for drama, whole turbot are some choices. The executive chef is Charlie England. The pastry chef, Stephanie Prida, will produce almond cheesecake and an array of Italian ices. “There’s still lots of room for New York City-driven food,” Mr. Torrisi said.

Hill removes the wig he has been wearing to hide a haircut.

His father, a dentist, had an office on the first floor of the six-story early 18th-century building, where he would tend to the neighborhood’s eclectic residents. “Some of them went to see the dentist after visiting Serge Gainsbourg,” Rauzy recalls, referring to his family’s onetime neighbor, the famed pop provocateur, “so of course they were full of whiskey!” Decades later, the area is known for its clothing boutiques and galleries.
