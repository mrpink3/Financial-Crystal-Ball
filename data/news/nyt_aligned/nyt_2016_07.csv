2016-07-01,Inside the List,"Class Mates: When Nancy Isenberg began her latest work of American history, “White Trash” — a comprehensive survey of the white underclass going back to colonial times — she had no idea that thanks largely to the very group she was writing about, Donald Trump would become the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Now that he has, and her suddenly topical book has entered the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8, I asked Isenberg (a history professor at Louisiana State University) what she made of the presidential race so far. “Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists,” she said via email. “By talking tough, by boasting that he’d love to throw a punch at a protester, Trump pretends he is stepping down from his opulent Manhattan penthouse to commingle with the unwashed masses. Wearing his bright red Bubba cap and crooning at one rally, ‘I love the poorly educated,’ he has built upon a familiar strain of American populism. Which is to say, a dose of redneck bluster goes a long way.” (The same dynamic, she noted, came to the Democrats’ aid in 1992: “It helped that Bill Clinton called himself Bubba and played the saxophone. It helped, too, that journalists dubbed him the Arkansas Elvis.”) I asked why underprivileged whites so often vote differently from poor people of other races — shouldn’t economic considerations be more or less colorblind? — and Isenberg reached back to history for her answer. “Southern white Democrats fueled racial conflict between poor blacks and whites in order to redirect the anger of the lower classes away from the white elite,” she said. “In 1790, John Adams argued that Americans not only scrambled to get ahead; they needed someone to disparage. . . . Lyndon Johnson came to the same conclusion, in explaining the racism of poor whites: ‘If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket.’ ” Then she returned to the current election cycle. “Trump’s supporters want class security, not revolution,” she said. “They want more blue-collar white male jobs, not equality, not social justice. They want to turn the clock backward in order to regain the white male pride that comes from being the family breadwinner. Trump’s slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ is a nostalgic appeal to the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s, when America was an industrial power and working-class jobs were plentiful. Until we understand our class system, warts and all, we will be saddled with an anemic democratic system that only makes our class and race resentments worse.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/books/review/inside-the-list.html

During the morning and afternoon the Allied troops captured the German first positions along the whole front of attack. North of the Somme the French troops established themselves in the approaches to the village of Hardecourt and in the outskirts of the village of Curlu, where fighting continues. South of the Somme the villages of Dampierre, Becquincourt, Bussu and Fay have fallen into our hands. The number of unwounded German prisoners taken by the French troops alone during the day is more than 3,500. On the left bank of the Meuse the whole of the region from Hill 304 to the Mort-Homme has been violently bombarded. On the right bank, toward ten o’clock in the morning, our infantry carried out an assault of the Thiaumont work, which was recaptured. The afternoon was marked by a recrudescence of the bombardment in this region, as well as in the Fumin and Chenois sectors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 2, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/1916-huge-battle-around-the-somme/

2016-07-04,1966: France Conducts Nuclear Test in Pacific,"PAPEETE, TAHITI — France yesterday [July 3] exploded an atomic bomb over a South Pacific atoll and was promptly condemned by the United States and Britain for ignoring the 1963 Moscow treaty banning atmospheric nuclear tests. The blast was the first of a series of nuclear explosions planned to test the trigger of France’s future hydrogen bombs. The bomb — a plutonium device — was exploded from a tower on the atoll of Mururoa, 800 miles southeast of Tahiti. The U.S. and British criticism of the blast was brushed aside by French officials as ‘‘irritatingly moralizing.’’ France refused to sign the 1963 treaty, claiming it was designed to persuade a U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly. Today most major countries joined in publicly condemning the French blast. But the Soviet Union and Communist China reported it without comment. French officials here and in Paris did not reveal the size of the explosion. A Defense Ministry communiqué from Paris said only that its power was in ‘‘the tactical range.’’ The blast was weak enough to allow French officials to stroll in the explosion area ten hours later wearing street clothes. The United States said it ‘‘regretted’’ that France has resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a time when most world nations have signed the limited test ban treaty. Japan, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and India were among other countries deploring the blast. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 4, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/1966-france-conducts-nuclear-test-in-pacific/

2016-07-04,1916: Allies Take Six More Villages in Somme Offensive,"PARIS — The third day of the gigantic battle now in progress on the western front has resulted in fresh gains for the victorious Franco-British troops. The number of villages now wrested from the invader has reached seventeen, and more than 12,300 prisoners are reported up to the present. The Germans have intensified and multiplied their counter-attacks, but, apart from slight successes at one or two points, have only added to the hecatombs of their dead on the battlefields of the Somme. The French troops, by a lightning advance, have now conquered along a front of seven and a half kilomètres the two lines of trenches forming the German second line between the Méreaucourt wood and the outskirts of Estrées, carrying by assault during the process the villages of Herbécourt, Feuillères and Assevillers and the Chapitre wood. During the afternoon they continued their advantage and, progressing beyond the enemy’s second line, took the villages of Buscourt and Flaucourt, an advance of five kilomètres in that region. The British troops fighting between the Somme and the Ancre have had to meet many powerful German counter-attacks, but despite the enemy’s desperate resistance the strongly-fortified village of La Boisselle has been captured, and the Germans are now fighting fiercely to retain the doomed village of Ovillers. Appalling losses have been inflicted on the enemy during his counter-attacks, and the British total of prisoners has reached 4,300. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 4, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/1916-allies-take-six-more-villages-in-somme-offensive/

Its new restaurant in Times Square takes cold cereal in inventive directions, thanks to Christina Tosi, the pastry chef behind the Milk Bar chain, who started serving cereal milk eight years ago. She has devised various combinations, six with a choice of milk (from a local dairy), soy milk or yogurt, and four with Blue Marble soft-serve ice cream. Extra ingredients include matcha, fresh peaches, lemon zest, passion-fruit jam made in Brooklyn, pistachios and white chocolate. Ten cereals are available, from basic Rice Krispies to rugged All-Bran to baroque Froot Loops. Despite the newfangled flavors, the restaurant also mines nostalgia with white brick walls, some vintage artifacts and little numbered cupboards that you open when your order is ready, almost like the Automat. It is owned by Anthony Rudolf, formerly of Per Se, whom Kellogg’s tapped for the partnership. The company wanted the restaurant to be run like and feel like a small business, and, as Andy Shripka, Kellogg’s associate marketing director, said, “we didn’t know how to do that.” Originally it hoped to open in the Flatiron district or the East Village, but the Midtown space became available. It made the company a bit nervous. “How can we be the opposite of what people expect here in Times Square?” Mr. Shripka said. Still, the high-profile location should help promote the brand: $6.50 to $9.50 for cereal bowls with toppings, 1600 Broadway (49th Street), no phone, kelloggsnyc.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/times-square-kelloggs-nyc-cereal.html

Older fans have felt that optimism before, as the bittersweet ESPN documentary “Doc & Darryl” recalls. The film, showing on Thursday, July 14, as part of the network’s “30 for 30” series, is built around a conversation between the slugger Darryl Strawberry and the pitcher Dwight Gooden, who in the mid-1980s were seen as the future of the franchise. But after the team’s memorable 1986 championship, things went sour, with drugs and other troubles cutting into both men’s legacies. The film, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, revisits those highs and lows through the memories of both players, and of some who witnessed their careers, including Jon Stewart and the Mets announcer Howie Rose. “I really thought, ‘My God, we are possibly looking at the closest thing to perfection that we’ve ever seen on a pitcher’s mound,’” Mr. Rose recalls of the early Gooden years.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/arts/television/in-doc-darryl-two-mets-recall-how-it-played-out.html

In “War Paint,” currently in previews and opening July 18, before what will be a certain transfer to Broadway, the two-time Tony winners Patti LuPone (“Evita,” “Gypsy”) and Christine Ebersole (“42nd Street,” “Grey Gardens”) play dueling C.E.O.s whose cosmetics empires helped define the multibillion-dollar beauty business. With a score by Scott Frankel and a book by Doug Wright, the show portrays the rivalry of Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden. In The Chicago Tribune, Michael Korie, the show’s lyricist, summed up how the news media pitted them against each other: “It was always Jew versus Gentile, American versus Eastern European. Like a Laurel and Hardy act,” he said. When it comes to this show, it will most likely also be Ms. LuPone versus Ms. Ebersole.

2016-07-08,How to Toss a Pizza,"“Take off any jewelry or watches,” says Tony Gemignani, an eight-time winner of the world championship in pizza-­dough acrobatics and owner of 16 pizzerias in California and Las Vegas. To avoid snags, your hands should be unadorned, with fingernails cut short. Roll or stretch a softball-­size ball of dough (11 to 14 ounces) into a 10-­inch circle. Drape it over your hands, and bring them up to your chest like a boxer. Your dominant hand should be palm up, the other in an upward-­facing fist. If you’re right handed, you’ll be rotating the dough in a clockwise spin (counterclockwise for lefties). To wind up for the toss, wheel your palm in the opposite direction of your eventual throw. Unwind, simultaneously pushing up and rotating your palm until the back of your wrist faces you. Release the dough just above your head, and catch it again at your upper chest atop the knuckles of both fists. Repeat. Try not to catch the dough right in the center, which can weaken the middle, resulting in what Gemignani calls “droopy” pizza slices. Always practice over a clean countertop so you can salvage fumbled catches.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/how-to-toss-a-pizza.html

Now, just shy of 30 years later, a group of American artists is again descending on Greece. This time, though, it’s happening on the island of Mykonos, for a group show, “Greek Gotham,” at Marina Vranopoulou’s year-old space, Dio Horia.

She started with lipsticks. “It was the area that always perturbed me the most, in terms of having an excess of colors,” the 32 year-old California native says. “I was like, ‘Let’s master this,’ because the potential for lipstick is so good — it’s all you really need on your face.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/t-magazine/kosas-botanical-lipstick-line.html

2016-07-12,"Tiny, Artistic Worlds — Inside Mini-Fridges","“Getting a car opened up my art practice,” admits the artist Brent Birnbaum, who’s based in Brooklyn but traveled as far afield as Staten Island, Connecticut and New Jersey to acquire the materials that form the basis of his new show: 45 pre-owned mini-fridges. Birnbaum spent four and a half years driving around to collect them, hauling them back one or two at a time. He was only interested in the relatively hard to find variety with faux-wood-paneled doors — when stacked in towers up to 10 feet high, the wood grain mimics a tree. Entering “Voyeur Voyager Forager Forester,” Birnbaum’s installation of 16 of these totems at Denny Gallery on the Lower East Side is intended to feel, then, a bit like walking into a dense, humming forest. And like all forests, this one is full of surprises: Using paint and other artistic tools, Birnbaum created a lively interior for each of the fridges, filling them with everyday items from earrings to toilet-paper rolls. All you have to do is open the door. (Birnbaum shared some detail shots of these little worlds with T in the slide show below; you can also experience “opening” the fridges by sliding your cursor over the image above.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/t-magazine/art/brent-birnbaum-fridge-art.html

(Consider: More than 76 million viewers tuned in for the “Seinfeld” finale, while the much anticipated “Mad Men” finale drew approximately 4.6 million.) Now the show and its influence are the subject of a new book, “­Seinfeldia,” by the entertainment writer Jennifer Kei­shin Armstrong, which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13. “They elevated the art of the sitcom,” Armstrong told NBC News recently. “They did things with it that they were told they couldn’t do.” What’s more, she said, for a show that was supposedly about nothing, “Seinfeld” managed to take on many of the social preoccupations of its time. That makes it tempting to imagine what the series would be like today had it continued. “It sounds weird,” Armstrong said, “but I would have loved to see them addressing things like 9/11 or terrorism. . . . When something is far enough away, you can start to attack it.” She added: “I’d be interested to see how they would address even more benign things like internet trolling, that sort of thing. Could they possibly pull off an episode about transgender issues? I would be interested.” Actually, the trans thing isn’t so hard to picture — remember when Kramer came up with the Bro, his bra for men?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Unlike many lines, the just-debuted Babes in Bathers, founded by 27-year-old Maayan Sherris, not only facilitates swimming, but celebrates it. The brand evolved out of a passion project that Sherris, a recent Parsons graduate and former employee at The Row, began last year when she shadowed the Columbia University women’s swim team for months in search of inspiration. “I had this idea of using real women and real situations to provoke fashion and original beauty,” she says. Sherris chose to focus on female swimmers in part because she’d always been fascinated by water (the element served as a springboard for her Parsons thesis collection) and in part because she’d always found swimmers’ bodies to be quite beautiful. “I always thought female swimmers didn’t get enough attention in terms of the way they look,” she says. “The bodies of male swimmers are idolized; women who play sports, their bodies are often considered distorted.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/t-magazine/fashion/babes-in-bathers-swimsuits-maayan-sherris.html

2016-07-20,1916: German Counterattack Fails,"PARIS — A furious battle has now been in progress for thirty-six hours in the village of Longueval and the Delville wood, the easterly limit of the British line, which turns due south at this point and joins up in a straight line with the French forces. The action constitutes the inevitable big effort of the enemy to recover the important positions carried by the British during their magnificent drive, which hallmarked the French National Holiday as a golden day in the ‘‘Big Push’’ and bit deeply into a new network of German defences which formed the pivot of the enemy’s line north of the Somme. The German attack, which opened at half-past five on Tuesday [July 19] evening, was elaborately stage-managed. It was preceded by an unusually violent bombardment by every description of projectile. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 20, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/1916-german-counterattack-fails/
2016-07-20,Letter of Recommendation: Just Dance,"I never really intended for it to become my workout routine.

Most of the system’s games would have them cultivating lethal marksmanship, while even the less-bloody titles seemed destined to foul up their reward system with excessive showers of virtual gold coins. “Just Dance,” by contrast, had a wholesome appeal. My children could listen to pop music while mirroring an avatar’s dance moves, as a motion detector judged their accuracy.

Diana Hopkins was the daughter of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s chief aide, Harry Hopkins. Her mother had died of cancer — though the book, which is presented as “based on Diana Hopkins’ childhood memories,” oddly leaves out mention of her mother. In 1943, when the story begins, Diana seems largely left to her own devices. We see her wandering unsupervised in and out of White House rooms making innocent mischief as her father and the rest of the grown-ups are busy dealing with the war.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/books/review/ken-burns-grover-cleveland-again-and-more.html

Previous studies showed that people living in cities risked experiencing anxiety and mood disorders at a much higher rate than noncity dwellers — from 29 percent to 39 percent more.The German study, published five years ago, tried to find out more specifically, or rather how, physiologically, this was so. To that end, researchers examined the brains of 50 people, some of whom lived in big cities, some in the country, while they were engaged in challenging mathematical exercises. Among city dwellers, the study found, the amygdala, a set of neurons lodged deep in the brain’s medial temporal lobe, went into overdrive during the experiment, meaning that urbanites are hypersusceptible to stress, presumably because they experience so much of it.

Maureen is still on the right side of the law, if only barely, in LET THE DEVIL OUT (Sarah Crichton/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26), which finds this volatile cop on her worst behavior, using her month of disciplinary probation to beat down men who stalk and attack women leaving bars alone at night. It’s the kind of after-hours vigilante work that’s gotten Maureen in trouble in the past. But “she was tougher now. Meaner. And she hoped she was smarter.” Well, maybe. But physical violence has become her raison d’être; in fact, the only time she feels safe is “when she was running and when she was chasing.

2016-07-22,Inside the List,"Too Real: To a certain kind of thriller writer, current events are catnip. Take Daniel Silva, whose novel “The Black Widow” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 1.

So “The Black Widow” opens with ISIS bombings in Paris and Amsterdam that inevitably call to mind actual attacks carried out since last fall in France and northern Europe. Yet any similarities, Silva notes in a foreword, are coincidental. “I commenced work on this novel before the Islamic terrorist group known as ISIS carried out a wave of shootings and bombings in Paris and Brussels that left more than 160 people dead,” he writes. “After briefly considering setting aside the typescript, I chose to complete it as originally conceived. . . .

2016-07-25,Could Hillary Clinton Become the Champion of the 99 Percent?,"In June of 2015, Felicia Joy Wong was in her car, awaiting with some apprehension the economic address that would officially open Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The speech was being staged at the F.D.R. memorial on New York City’s Roosevelt Island, and though Wong is a political operative of atypical modesty — she describes herself as a former schoolteacher whose accession to minor power has been entirely accidental — she had taken the choice of venue as auspicious. Wong runs the Roosevelt Institute, a small think tank (for lack of a better term) that originated in trusts established to promote the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor. Its chief economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, indirectly coined the Occupy movement’s enduring slogan (“We are the 99 percent”), and Stiglitz and Wong each saw the election as an opportunity to channel Occupy energy into national politics. The country was perhaps ready once again, they believed, for what F.D.R. called “bold, persistent experimentation” in our economic affairs. Two of Wong’s senior staff members had gone to the island for the event, but she herself bowed out, claiming the duties of a part-time suburban soccer coach and mom.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/magazine/could-hillary-clinton-become-the-champion-of-the-99-percent.html

A veteran politician with a national profile will probably hit between 12 and 16 of them in a week like this, if you assume about three or four a day multiplied by four convention mornings.

2016-07-28,Inside the List,"Agatha Redux: The British crime writer Ruth Ware has two best sellers this week — her new novel, “The Woman in Cabin 10,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, while her debut, “In a Dark, Dark Wood,” remains No. 8 on the trade paperback list after nine weeks. (My favorite thing about that book, which centers on an amnesiac and a bachelorette party gone very wrong, was learning that the British call such gatherings “hen parties.” One London reviewer described the story as “the hen party from hell,” which makes you think things might end in nuggets and dipping sauce.) Both of Ware’s novels resemble classic locked-door mysteries: Her first takes place in a remote English country house and her latest on a cruise ship in the North Sea — a horrifying enough prospect for some of us even before the protagonist witnesses a murder and is accused of losing her mind. Unsurprisingly, Ware said last year that she was a big fan of the golden-age mystery writers. “I love classic crime,” she told NPR’s David Greene during her “Dark Wood” publicity tour. “I read a huge amount of it as a kid, you know, Agatha Christie, Josephine Tey, Dorothy L. Sayers, Sherlock Holmes. And I didn’t consciously channel that when I was writing. But when I finished and reread the book, I did suddenly realize how much this kind of structure owed to, particularly, Agatha Christie. It wasn’t consciously done, but I think the setting, you know, the way it’s a closed cast of characters — I would say I definitely owe a debt to Christie.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Harden has trained thousands of rats for movies like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” and television shows like “True Blood.” He and his colleagues schooled 600 rats for the 2003 horror movie “Willard.” “I can watch that movie now,” he says, “and pick out the 12 or 13 rats that really captured our hearts.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/magazine/how-to-train-a-rat.html

2016-07-29,Does the Disappearance of Sea Ice Matter?,"Every month, the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., puts out a news release about how much ice is floating on the cold seas at the top of the world. Those who follow this obscure bit of news will know that last month marked the lowest extent of Arctic sea ice on record for June, going back to the beginning of satellite observations in the late 1970s. And summer still has a few months to go. Arctic sea ice typically shrinks until mid-September, when darker nights and colder temperatures come, and the ice cover begins to expand again. We don’t yet know if the approaching yearly minimum this September will be the historical low, but it seems on track to possibly match, or even exceed, the previous record minimum, which occurred in 2012. Nathan Kurtz, a NASA researcher who did an aerial survey of the ice cover in early July, told me recently, “It’s been a very warm year in the Arctic.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/magazine/does-the-disappearance-of-sea-ice-matter.html
