The first one to the punch was a longtime Wikipedia contributor known as CltFn, who at about 7 that morning created what’s called a stub — little more than a placeholder, often just one sentence in length, which other contributors may then build upon — under the heading “Fort Dix Terror Plot.” A while later, another Wikipedia user named Gracenotes took an interest as well. Over the next several hours, in constant cyberconversation with an ever-growing pack of other self-appointed editors, Gracenotes — whose real name is Matthew Gruen — expanded and corrected this stub 59 times, ultimately shaping it into a respectable, balanced and even footnoted 50-line account of that day’s major development in the war on terror. By the time he was done, “2007 Fort Dix Attack Plot” was featured on Wikipedia’s front page.

2007-07-02,Manifold Destiny,"Anyone who has ever imagined living life totally on his or her own terms would do well to study the lessons of “Passion and Principle,” Sally Denton’s lively revisionist accounting of John and Jessie Frémont. The couple, she posits, were the embodiment of American history during its most vital 19th-century moments, including the opening of the West, the creation of the Republican Party, the Civil War and beyond. The Frémonts were the John and Abigail Adams of their time, or the Charles and Anne Lindbergh, or even the Franklin and Eleanor, John and Jackie, Bill and Hillary — a couple who sought, consciously and unconsciously, to move society forward and, in varying degrees, were both rewarded and pilloried for doing so. It is Denton’s belief that owing largely to their progressive views — particularly their virulent opposition to slavery, paired with Jessie’s feminism — the Frémonts suffered more than most; they were multimillionaires and came just shy of being the president and first lady at the height of their powers, but wound up historical punch lines, relegated to ever smaller and meaner living arrangements in the twilight of their lives.

Today these buildings are showing signs of wear, and their idiosyncratic designs (and relative youth, from a preservation standpoint) make them vulnerable to alteration or demolition unless they find a sympathetic owner.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01stylehouse-t.html

With one difference: I’m black, born and raised in the United States. At the parties and conferences I attend, and in the book reviews I read, I rarely encounter other African-American “literary” writers, particularly in my age bracket. There just don’t seem to be that many of us out there, and that’s something I’ve come to wonder about a great deal.

The first — “Darwin’s Black Box” (1996), which purported to make the scientific case for “intelligent design” — was enlivened by a spark of conviction, however misguided. The second is the book of a man who has given up. Trapped along a false path of his own rather unintelligent design, Behe has left himself no escape. Poster boy of creationists everywhere, he has cut himself adrift from the world of real science. And real science, in the shape of his own department of biological sciences at Lehigh University, has publicly disowned him, via a remarkable disclaimer on its Web site: “While we respect Prof. Behe’s right to express his views, they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the department. It is our collective position that intelligent design has no basis in science, has not been tested experimentally and should not be regarded as scientific.” As the Chicago geneticist Jerry Coyne wrote recently, in a devastating review of Behe’s work in The New Republic, it would be hard to find a precedent.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Dawkins-t.html

Last Oct. 7, Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta, one of Moscow’s smallest but most daring newspapers, was murdered. A 48-year-old who was about to become a grandmother, she had gained fame in the West, and infamy at home, for her writings on the war in Chechnya. Politkovskaya fell in an all-too-common post-Soviet fashion: three bullets to the chest, one “control shot” to the head. Within days, Vladimir Putin reassured the West that Politkovskaya, the 13th journalist killed during his reign, had “minimal” influence. She was, he said, “known among journalists and in human rights circles and in the West, but I repeat that she had no influence on political life.

The private Manhattan girls’ school she attended prided itself on its rigorous academic standards and on instilling a spirit of critical inquiry among its students. The effects of this educational approach were evident in the feisty, affectionately subversive speeches the class speakers gave; its influence could also be felt in the impressively varied interpretation of the dress code — mandating that all graduating seniors wear white — which presented itself on the stage that day. As the girls came forward in alphabetical order, the sartorial array was something to behold: stringy tank dresses that looked perfect for a day at the beach were followed by elegant sheaths that could have done double duty as bridesmaids’ dresses; virginal frocks were preceded by vah-vah-voom numbers.

So, Homer told me not long ago, he ruled out building a flying spacecraft but decided that “the glove contest represented something of the scale I could achieve working out of my home by myself.” He’d always been a garage tinkerer, he said, and being unemployed, he also wanted to prove to his 14-year-old son “that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.” Oh, he added offhandedly, “the money is a motivator, too.” At stake was a prize — presented with one of those giant cardboard checks — for $200,000.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01nasa-t.html

2007-07-02,‘The Shadow Catcher’," Let me tell you about the sketch by Leonardo I saw one afternoon in the Queen's Gallery in London a decade ago, and why I think it haunts me. The Queen's Gallery is on the west front side of Buckingham Palace, on a street that's always noisy, full of taxis rushing round the incongruous impediment of a massive residence in the middle of a route to Parliament and Westminster Abbey and, more importantly, a train station named Victoria. The Queen's Gallery is small, neither well maintained nor adequately lit, and when I went there to see the Royal Collection of Da Vinci drawings, the day was pissing rain and cold and damp, and the room smelled of wet wool seasoned in the lingering aroma of fry-up and vinegar, an atmosphere far removed from the immediacy, muscularity, and sunny beauty of Da Vinci's subjects. There were drawings of male adolescents, drawings of chubby infants, drawings of rampant horses, toothless women, old men with spiky white hairs on their noses and boils on their chins - and then, in a corner, there was a different kind of sketch, a map. It was drawn in ochre on a sheet of rough, uneven rag approximately the size of ordinary letter paper, the same color as southern California sandstone. I stood in front of it for something like too long because a guard stepped forward 'til I leaned away, still looking at it, mesmerized. Some things you remember for a lifetime; other things, mysteriously, bleed away, or fade to shadow. Sometimes, you try to bring the memory of something back, and can't. You try to see a face, recapture love, recapture rapture; but it's gone, that face, that vibrancy. Other images return without your bidding. Almost every night when I'm at home, alone, in bed, before I fall asleep, my mind presents that sketch of Leonardo's without warning. Onto that inner space where dreams take place, my mind projects its image. I see it, plain as day - a little piece of sandstone-colored paper on which an Italian coastal town is drawn from a perspective high above the ground, so high that no treetop, no cliff, no man-made promontory could have served as Leonardo's point of view. It's the view an airplane affords, a view Da Vinci must have drawn from an imaginary self-projection; and judging from the scale of things, he must have been imagining himself ten thousand feet above the ground, or almost two miles up. Commercial airline pilots volunteer this kind of information - altitude and cruising speed - which is how I've learned to estimate how high above the ground I am, looking from an airplane window. I've learned what the Earth looks like from a great height - but how did Leonardo know? Are we hardwired, as a species, to imagine flying? We take it for granted now, most of us, this point of view, as a second site, because many of us have flown, many of us have been up there, and, even if we haven't, most of us have seen the pictures of our world as a distant object, beamed to Earth by satellite. We can adopt this point of view as a modern way of looking, but is it modern? What if there's something in our psyches designed to see things from above? Isn't it a possibility that, as humans, we were built to dream from heights? That Columbus dreamed of flying to America, dreamed his future landfall from above? That Lewis and Clark, bedding down on rocky ground, flew at night across the Cascade Mountains in their dreams, above sequoias, over the Columbia, toward the valiant coast to the magnificent Pacific? Maybe we are built to reconnoiter from above, survey the Earth from heaven, dream of flying. Maybe it's the angel in us. Gertrude Stein, the first time she flew, saw in Earth's crevasses and folds the antecedents of cubism and told Picasso that he'd stolen that artistic vision off the backs of birds. I want to think that Galileo flew, in thought. I want to think that all the peasants in the fields of history dreamed in flight, that all the slaves and all indentured souls whose dust still gathers on this Earth had wings at night, and aspirations swift enough for uplift. I want to believe we're built for soaring in our thoughts, and out here on the edge, in California, at night, in that fading wakefulness before sleep erases sight, my mind projects that sketch of Leonardo's, and then, before I realize it, I'm flying in, flying to America, making landfall on this continent, not from over the Pacific, not from Singapore or Australia, Fiji or Hawaii on routes I've flown in real airplanes, but I dream I'm coming in across the other ocean, over the Atlantic, like Columbus. Flying in, not as I've done from England and Europe in a jumbo jet with Greenland off the starboard side, down the Scotia coast with Halifax below, but flying in and making my first contact off the Carolina coast near the 37th meridian, where the English landed, equidistant from the Catholic French in Canada and the Spanish Jesuits in Florida. I dream I'm flying in across Cape Hatteras, where that little spit of land cricks around Pamlico Sound, where the Tuscarora were. Where the Tuscarora fished and lived and danced and laughed and loved before the measles and the smallpox took them. Here in California, on the edge, at night, after the coyotes end their braying, there's an hour after midnight when a silence drops into these canyons which persists 'til the first birdsong of morning, and, in that intervening lull, I give myself to flying in, west from Tuscarora marshland over Choctaw sands and Chickasaw meadows - I project myself speeding toward myself - flying, as the eagle flies, over Creek, Catawba, Natchez, Kiowa, Comanche and Plains Apache, Wichita and Zuni, Navajo and Hopi, above the First and Second Mesas, over Acoma and Chaco Canyon, across the Colorado toward the Paiute, Chumash and Morongo, here, where I am in Los Angeles. There are those who say the sound my country makes at night, the sound I hear when flying, the sound my nation exhales as it sleeps, is the sound of prayer, the sound of Jesus Christ arising from the basalt in the Rockies, splitting hearts of granite as he shakes off chains of time and is reborn, and there are those who claim the sound my nation makes at night is the metallic hiss of money in the forge or the sound of slavery's jism misspent in anger and assimilation, or that the sound my nation makes is the sizzle of cosmetic simulation, the sound the cutting edge of surgical removal makes, the sound of History slipping into coma, cosmic silence, almost total, through which, in my dream of flying, I perceive a hopeful distant note - the sound my country makes - a note so confirming and annunciatory that it seems to bend into itself, bend into its own impending future like an announcing angel comin' round the mountain, bend the way a shadow bends, conforming to the curvature of Earth, wailing gently through the night. That sound is the siren's sound of the iron road, a haunting whistle. I fly, in my imagination, over the abandoned Plains, the Rockies, and the ghost.

2007-07-02,Paperback Row,"THE AMALGAMATION POLKA, by Stephen Wright. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95. ) Wright’s fourth novel is a rambling Civil War picaresque about a man caught between the fierce abolitionist sentiments of his parents and his grandparents’ allegiance to the Confederacy. Liberty Fish, the son of a Northern father and a mother exiled from her family’s South Carolina plantation, enlists in the Union Army when the war breaks out. He embarks on a bloody tour of duty — involving charlatans, preachers and pirates — and eventually makes his way to his mother’s childhood home. In the Book Review, Laura Miller called this novel “endlessly beguiling”: “For Wright, America, past and present, is Wonderland, a place of marvels and horrors from which not even the fortunate escape with their heads.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/0701bb-paperback.html

The pageant was held in a grand manner ""worthy of the god and his particular excellence."" One individual stood out among the participants: Chrysis, priestess of Athena Polias. For her role in making the occasion one that befitted both Athens and Delphi, the people of Delphi bestowed upon Chrysis the crown of Apollo. The city also voted to grant her, as well as all her descendants, an impressive series of rights and privileges: status as a special representative of Athens to Delphi (proxenos), the right to consult the oracle, priority of trial, inviolability (asylia), freedom from taxes, a front seat at all competitions held by the city, the right to own land and houses, and all other honors customary for proxenoi and benefactors of the city.

Incessant repetition of this simple process over eons built the wonders of biology from the ground up, from the intricate molecular machinery of cells up to and including the human mind.

That was when my grandfather banished my father from our lives forever for some transgression that was not to be disclosed to us children, though we overheard whispered references to bankruptcy, bootlegging, and jail time. His name was never again spoken in our presence; he just abruptly disappeared from our lives. The shame and disgrace that enveloped our family as a result of these events, along with the ensuing divorce, just about destroyed my mother. Is it possible today to make anyone understand the harsh judgment of such failures in the late 1920's? Throughout my entire life, whenever I was asked about my father, I always said that he was dead. When he actually died I never knew. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/chapters/0701-1st-kali.html

But on the other side, another horrendous reminder of how close the circuit is to racing calamity, with the terrible GP2 accident yesterday, from which, fortunately, the driver escaped with only bruising, and like Kubica before him, a small concussion. But the Formula One paddock learned this morning of tragic news. Three people were killed and two were seriously injured in a helicopter accident last night, as they flew from the circuit to a hotel in a nearby town.

Last Friday, just before the start of the fall couture collections, our photographer Ed Alcock dropped in at Dior, Chanel and Christian Lacroix, as seamstress and tailors were sewing clothes. Couture models are made in pieces, to accommodate the flow of deliveries from embroiderers and other specialists, and then everything is assembled. At Dior, the workers were awash in the bright tulle and silk that would become John Galliano’s show for the 60th anniversary of the house. Pride? Yes. The people in the ateliers love a visitor to (slightly) gawp at the quality of their handwork. And they like a good joke.

In a full-page article in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, above, said a portrayal by Mr. Cruise of the officer, Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, “would promote Germany’s image more than 10 football World Cups.” The German government said last week that it would not allow the filmmakers to use the site where Mr. Stauffenberg was executed. A government spokesman said the decision had nothing to do with Mr. Cruise’s affiliation with Scientology, which is regarded by the government as a dangerous cult.

2007-07-06,Theater Listings,"ICE FACTORY ’07 This summer’s outbreak of theater festivals, one of the more virulent in recent memory, continues apace. Aside from those recently closed (Brits Off Broadway, Gayfest NYC) and those happening now (Women Center Stage, Hot!), there are more on the way (Lincoln Center Festival, Fresh Fruit and others) leading up to the biggie — the New York International Fringe Festival — which will soon grab most of the headlines and actors. But SoHo Think Tank’s annual Ice Factory festival is older (this is its 14th showing ) and far less chaotic than the Fringe. Seven plays in seven weeks, one at a time: nice and simple. The festival has previously provided an arena for envelope-pushing companies like Elevator Repair Service, Pig Iron Theater Company and Les Freres Corbusier to develop new work for possible productions, and the fare this time around will be equally offbeat. First is “No More Pretending (a k a the Return of Indiebot)” by Kirk Wood Bromley, the artistic director of Inverse Theater, which has been producing new American verse plays since 1998. Mr. Bromley’s play is itself a celebration of indie theater and centers on a reunion of three actors who used to work together and have since traveled different paths. It closes tomorrow night to make way for next weekend’s offering — a tall tale by Rachel Shukert about a promiscuous frontiersman, presented by the Bushwick Hotel theater company — and the five additional productions that follow. Forthcoming highlights include Alena Smith’s “Lacy Project” (July 25 to 28), directed by Susanna Gellert and starring Kristen Connolly (above). Ms. Smith’s play, developed at the Yale School of Drama, was a finalist for the 2006 O’Neill Playwrights Conference and a 2006 Princess Grace Award.

2007-07-09,City Ballet Dancer Sidelined for the Summer Season,"Nilas Martins, right, a New York City Ballet principal dancer arrested on a cocaine charge, will not appear for the rest of the company’s season in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., City Ballet said yesterday. “The company regards this as a private, though serious, matter,” it said in a brief statement, adding that the decision was “consistent with company policy.” Mr. Martins’s lawyer, E. Stewart Jones Jr. of Troy, N.Y., said his client and the ballet company agreed that the publicity presented too much of a distraction. Mr. Martins, 40, the son of Peter Martins, the company’s master in chief, maintains his position with City Ballet and will return for the Lincoln Center season, Mr. Jones said. The dancer was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. The police said he was trying to hide a bag containing a half-gram of cocaine. “He denies any knowledge of what that substance was,” Mr. Jones said. “He has a very innocent explanation for how that substance came to be.” A hearing scheduled for yesterday was put off until Aug. 3, he added. “There’s a lot that’s not known to be ferreted out before this case can be discussed and resolved.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/07/arts/07arts-CITYBALLETDA_BRF.html

2007-07-09,Simpsons Movie to Be ‘Imperfect’,"Matt Groening, creator of “The Simpsons,” says the long-awaited film version of the popular television series will be deliberately “imperfect,” BBC News reported. Mr. Groening said the movie was “a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation, which is basically disappearing.” He added that “all the animated movies these days are computer generated,” but that the “Simpsons” film was being created in “the old-fashioned, clumsy, ‘erase it if you don’t do it right’ way.” A 10-minute preview shown to journalists featured Bart Simpson skateboarding naked through downtown Springfield and his sister Lisa meeting a potential new boyfriend. Another sequence showed the rock band Green Day being booed off a stage for expressing environmental concerns. The show’s executive producer, Al Jean, denied that the film represented a winding down of the Simpsons franchise. Instead, he said, it would help “bring more people in” to the series, which was first broadcast in December 1989. “The Simpsons Movie” is scheduled to be released on July 27.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/07/arts/07arts-SIMPSONSMOVI_BRF.html

It was dismissed by the hawkish Bush administration as a meaningless popularity contest that wimpy liberals wanted to engage in.

At a given bar on a given night, he wrote, these disease-free singles would then make the pool of sexually active adults safer.

2007-07-09,Bad Medicine,"Noga Arikha’s “Passions and Tempers” illustrates some of the rewards and some of the pitfalls of historical scholarship. To Arikha’s immense credit, she provides a thoroughly documented account of the ways in which a wrong-headed theory dominated medical thinking for more than 2,000 years, refusing to yield place at the bedside long after it had been proved erroneous by clear-eyed observation and the development of experimental science. One of Arikha’s contributions to the general reader’s knowledge, in fact, is to use the history of the humors — those bodily fluids once thought to hold the key to understanding human health and personality — to demonstrate the difficulty that physicians have always had in giving up outmoded ways of treating actual patients. This has almost invariably been the case, even when not only the theoretical but also the practical basis for a changed approach has already been established, sometimes by the very clinicians who cannot bring themselves to abandon the discredited practices. Arikha is hardly treading new ground here, but she does provide convincing and very specific evidence of a human failing that dogged the profession until at least the middle of the 20th century, and in certain ways continues to influence modern-day diagnosis and therapy.

But just when you’re thinking “Oxygen Network,” the story takes a sharp turn.

Now Grass’s memoir, “Peeling the Onion,” has been published in the United States, and, this week, John Irving offers a ringing defense of his friend and mentor. Grass, of course, is no stranger to political controversy. Irving thinks it’s different in America: “When you’re interviewed as a writer in this country,” he said in an e-mail message, “you’re rarely asked about your politics; in fact, if you express a political opinion, the interviewer often looks uncomfortable. Maybe writers in America aren’t supposed to be political? Movie stars, and other celebrities, are routinely mocked for their politics. But in Europe, a writer is expected to have political opinions — and to express them. My parents never withheld their political opinions; I got my politics from them. I’m a liberal — like a lot of people nowadays, a deeply discontented Democrat. I support Planned Parenthood; I’m an abortion-rights activist. Yet, of my 11 novels, I would describe only two (‘The Cider House Rules’ and ‘A Prayer for Owen Meany’) as political novels — in the case of ‘Cider House,’ I would say it’s positively polemical.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Upfront-t.html

That moment was memorable because it was so ludicrous. “Celebrity journalist” is a term many consider oxymoronic at best; at worst, such a creature is among the lowest of life-forms, and a person who writes about movie stars, whether as reporter or junketeering reviewer, is about as likely to have intimate relations with one of his shimmering subjects as a jumbo shrimp is with a rainbow trout. “It never happens,” as the British film critic Antonia Quirke rightly notes in “Choking on Marlon Brando,” her giddy new memoir. “No actor has ever gone out with a critic in the history of the world.” And then, all but stamping her foot: “I hate actors.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Jacobs-t.html

The combination creates some memorable encounters. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author, once watched as a particularly charming 8-year-old Williams girl, who was visiting Sacks at his hotel, took a garrulous detour into a wedding ceremony. “I’m afraid she disrupted the flow of this wedding,” Sacks told me. “She also mistook the bride’s mother for the bride.

The allegations, in a lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal District Court by six former employees, involve the restaurant V Steakhouse in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. V Steakhouse closed at the end of 2005. The lawsuit accuses V Steakhouse of illegally dividing tips among the restaurant’s managers as well as the servers, busboys and captains. The lawsuit also says that because V Steakhouse handled the tips that way, it underpaid the nonmanagerial employees, because they earned less than the minimum wage under state law, which was $6 an hour when the restaurant closed. D. Maimon Kirschenbaum, the lawyer representing the former V Steakhouse workers, said restaurant owners are allowed to pay employees who receive tips less than the minimum wage, but not if the tips are divided among “nontipped employees” like managers.

In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Rowling said: “I think that Harry’s story comes to quite a clear end in Book Seven. But I have always said that I wouldn’t say never. I can’t say I will never write another book about that world, just because I think, ‘What do I know, in 10 years’ time I might want to return to it.’ But I think it is unlikely.” Meanwhile, thousands of fans have signed a petition urging the author to keep the series going after the publication of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” on July 21. Despite speculation that Harry might die in the novel, the Waterstone’s book chain, which established the petition, said his demise would be no obstacle to further adventures. “Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, yet brought him back after years of demand from his fans and publishers,” said Wayne Winstone of Waterstone’s. “Couldn’t the same happen for Harry Potter?” But at least one person said he was happy that the series is ending. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry on screen, described himself in an interview in the August issue of Details as “the only kid in the world who doesn’t want an eighth Harry Potter book.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/arts/10arts-MSROWLINGDRO_BRF.html

British factories are benefiting from an economic pickup in the euro region, which buys half of their exports. Exports to non-European Union countries rose in May, by 2.3 percent, and imports fell by 1.9 percent, narrowing the gap in the goods trade to £3.5 billion.

Capital, its successor, Lending Universe, and a related company, Northside Capital, brokered more than a thousand home mortgages and home equity loans, the authorities said.

Significant price breaks are available for spectators ages 16-21 and 65 and over. Travelers be forewarned, however. There’s precious little to do in Carnoustie besides watching the tournament.

But critics at the sites WhatAboutOurDaughters.org and at PetitionOnLine.com contend that the show perpetuates black stereotypes by focusing on negative behavior and appearances. “You beam it overseas to people not familiar with images of African-Americans,” Gina McCauley, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., who created the What About Our Daughters blog, said yesterday.

The royal wrath was incurred in March, according to a forthcoming BBC documentary, when the queen sat for four portraits by Ms. Leibovitz in advance of a visit to the United States. Ms. Leibovitz, whose works include a naked, very pregnant Demi Moore and a nude John Lennon hugging a clothed Yoko Ono, suggested that the queen, who was wearing ceremonial robes, remove her crown. “I think it will look better without the crown because the garter robe is so ...” Ms. Leibovitz said. The queen interrupted her. “Less dressy?” she asked. “What do you think this is?” she asked, pointing at what she was wearing and giving the photographer an icy stare. The queen then stalked off, trailed by an official bearing the train of her blue velvet cape, while she told another servant: “I’m not changing anything. I’ve had enough dressing like this, thank you very much.” The BBC documentary, “A Year With the Queen,” a behind-the-scenes look at royal life, was filmed over the last year and will be broadcast in September or October.

But the enduring race format, which involves solo and relay-team riders cranking as many laps as possible in 24 hours on a pre-marked course, is now celebrated at dozens of events around the country each summer. Two of the biggest -- 24 Hours of 9 Mile in Wausau, Wis., and 24 Hours of Killington in Vermont -- take place the weekend of July 28. At the Killington race, part of a national series of six 24-hour races, riders pedal a 9.28-mile course that includes a thigh-killing 1,798 feet of elevation gain per lap. Team and solo riders pedal through the day and night, donning powerful bike lights once the sun sets to illuminate the twisting technical trail. Points are racked up with each completed lap. In Wisconsin, 24 Hours of 9 Mile is the national championship race for one of cycling’s strangest of subgenres. The solo winners will spin through more than 200 miles of knobby-tire riding, starting Saturday at 10 a.m. and not stopping until Sunday at the same time, when they finish -- ragged, muddy, and zombie-like, but smiling from knowing they just pulled off the nearly impossible.

2007-07-12,Transcript: President Bush on Iraq,"PRESIDENT BUSH: Good morning. Thank you. Yesterday America lost an extraordinary first lady and a fine Texan, Lady Bird Johnson. She brought grace to the White House and beauty to our country. On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our condolences to her daughters, Lynda and Luci, and we offer our prayers to the Johnson family. Before I answer some of your questions, today I'd like to provide the American people with an update on the situation in Iraq. Since America began military operations in Iraq, the conflict there has gone through four major phases. The first phase was the liberation of Iraq from Saddam Hussein. The second phase was the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people and the holding of free elections. The third phase was the tragic escalation of sectarian violence, sparked by the bombing of the golden mosque in Samarra. We've entered a fourth phase, deploying reinforcements and launching new operations to help Iraqis bring security to their people. I'm going to explain why the success of this new strategy is vital for protecting our people and bringing our troops home, which is a goal shared by all Americans. I'll brief you on the report we are sending to Congress. I'll discuss why a drawdown of forces that is not linked to the success of our operations would be a disaster. As president, my most solemn responsibility is to keep the American people safe. So on my orders, good men and women are now fighting the terrorists on the front lines in Iraq. I've given our troops in Iraq clear objectives. And as they risk their lives to achieve these objectives, they need to know they have the unwavering support from the commander in chief, and they do. And they need the enemy to know that America is not going to back down. So when I speak to the American people about Iraq, I often emphasize the importance of maintaining our resolve and meeting our objectives. As a result, sometimes the debate over Iraq is cast as a disagreement between those who want to keep our troops in Iraq and those who want to bring our troops home, and this is not the real debate. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to see the day when our brave service men and women can start coming home. In my address to the nation in January, I put it this way: If we increase our support at this crucial moment, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home. The real debate over Iraq is between those who think the fight is lost or not worth the cost and those who believe the fight can be won, and that as difficult as the fight is, the cost of defeat would be far higher. I believe we can succeed in Iraq, and I know we must. So we're working to defeat al Qaeda and other extremists and aid the rise of an Iraqi government that can protect its people, deliver basic services (OTCBB:BICV) and be an ally in the war against these extremists and radicals. By doing this, we'll create the conditions that would allow our troops to begin coming home while securing our long-term national interests in Iraq and in the region. When we start drawing down our forces in Iraq, it will (be) because our military commanders say the conditions on the ground are right, not because pollsters say it'll be good politics. The strategy I announced in January is designed to seize the initiative and create those conditions. It's aimed at helping the Iraqis strengthen their government so that it can function even amid violence. It seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to advance the difficult process of national reconciliation, which is essential to lasting security and stability. It is focused on applying sustained military pressure to route-out terrorist networks in Baghdad and surrounding areas. It is committed to using diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraqi's democratic government. Doing all these things, it is intended to make possible a more limited role in Iraq for the United States. That's the goal outlined by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. That's the goal shared by the Iraqis and our coalition partners. It is the goal that Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and our troops are working hard to make a reality. Our top priority is to help the Iraqis protect their population. So we've launched an offensive in and around Baghdad to go after extremists, to buy more time for Iraqi forces to develop and to help normal life and civil society take root in communities and neighborhoods throughout the country. We're helping enhance the size, capabilities and effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces, so the Iraqis can take over the defense of their own country. We're helping the Iraqis take back their neighborhoods from the extremists. In Anbar province, Sunni tribes that were once fighting alongside al Qaeda against our coalition are now fighting alongside our coalition against al Qaeda. We're working to replicate this success in Anbar and other parts of the country. Two months ago in the supplemental appropriations bill funding our troops, Congress established 18 benchmarks to gauge the progress of the Iraqi government. They require we submit a full report to Congress by September the 15th. Today my administration has submitted to Congress an interim report that requires us to assess, and I quote the bill, ""whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these benchmarks is or is not being achieved."" Of the 18 benchmarks Congress asked us to measure, we can report that satisfactory progress is being made in eight areas. For example, Iraqis have provided the three brigades they promised for operations in and around Baghdad, and the Iraqi government is spending nearly $7.3 billion from its own funds this year to train, equip and modernize its forces. In eight other areas, the Iraqis have much more work to do. For example, they have not done enough to prepare for local elections or pass a law to share oil revenues. And in two remaining areas, progress is too mixed to be characterized one way or the other. Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks. Those of us who believe the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism. Our strategy is built on the premise that progress on security will pave the way for political progress, so it's not surprising that political progress is lagging behind the security gains we are seeing. Economic development funds are critical to helping Iraq make this political progress. Today I'm exercising the waiver authority granted me by Congress to release a substantial portion of those funds. The bottom line is that this is a preliminary report, and it comes less than a month after the final reinforcements arrived in Iraq. This September, as Congress has required, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington to provide a more comprehensive assessment. By that time, we hope to see further improvement in the positive areas and the beginning of improvement in the negative areas. We'll also have a clearer picture of how the new strategy is unfolding, and be in a better position to judge where we need to make any adjustments. I will rely on General Petraeus to give me his recommendations for the appropriate troop levels in Iraq. I will discuss the recommendation with the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I will continue consultations with members of the United States Congress from both sides of the aisle. And then I'll make a decision. I know some in Washington would like us to start leaving Iraq now. To begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us we're ready would be dangerous for Iraq, for the region and for the United States. It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to Al Qaida. It'd mean that we'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It'd mean we'd allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan. It'd mean we'd be increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous. The fight in Iraq is part of a broader struggle that's unfolding across the region. The same region in Iran -- the same regime in Iran that is pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe Israel off the map is also providing sophisticated IEDs to extremists in Iraq who are using them to kill American soldiers. The same Hezbollah terrorists who are waging war against the forces of democracy in Lebanon are training extremists to do the same against coalition forces in Iraq. The same Syrian regime that provides support and sanctuary for Islamic Jihad and Hamas has refused to close its airport in Damascus to suicide bombers headed to Iraq. All these extremist groups would be emboldened by a precipitous American withdrawal, which would confuse and frighten friends and allies in the region. Nations throughout the Middle East have a stake in a stable Iraq. To protect our interests and show our commitment to our friends in the region, we are enhancing our military presence, improving our bilateral security ties and supporting those fighting the extremists across the Middle East. We're also using the tools of diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraq's democratic government. So I'm sending Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice to the region in early August. They will meet with our allies, reemphasize our commitment to the international compact of Sharm el-Sheikh, reassure our friends that the Middle East remains a vital strategic priority for the United States. There is a conversion (sic) of visions between what Iraqi leaders want, what our partners want and what our friends in the region want and the vision articulated by my administration, the Iraq Study Group and others here at home. The Iraqis do not want U.S. troops patrolling their cities forever, any more than the American people do. But we need to ensure that when U.S. forces do pull back, the terrorists and extremists cannot take control. The strategy that General Petraeus and the troops he commands are now carrying out is the best opportunity to bring us to this point. So I ask Congress to provide them with the time and resources they need. The men and women of the United States military have made enormous sacrifices in Iraq. They have achieved great things, and the best way to begin bringing them home is to make sure our new strategy succeeds. And, now, I'd be glad to answer a few questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, you started this war, the war of your choosing, and you can end it alone, today, at this point. Bring in peacekeepers, U.N. peacekeepers. Two million Iraqis have fled their country as refugees. Two million more are displaced. Thousands and thousands are dead. Don't you accept -- don't you understand, we brought the Al Qaida into Iraq? BUSH: Actually, I was hoping to solve the Iraqi issue diplomatically. That's why I went to the United Nations and worked with the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously passed a resolution that said, Disclose, disarm or face serious consequences. That was the message -- clear message to Saddam Hussein. He chose the course. QUESTION: But didn't we go into Iraq? BUSH: It was his decision to make. Obviously, it was a difficult decision for me to make to send our brave troops, along with coalition troops, into Iraq. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein is power. Now the fundamental question facing America is: Will we stand with this young democracy? Will we help them achieve stability? Will we help them become an ally in this war against extremists and radicals that is not only evident in Iraq, but it's evident in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan? We're at the beginning stages of a great ideological conflict between those who yearn for peace and those who want their children to grow up in a normal, decent society -- and radicals and extremists who want to impose their dark vision on people throughout the world. Iraq is obviously -- Helen, has got the attention of the American people, as it should. This is a difficult war, and it's a tough war. But as I have consistently stated throughout the -- this presidency, it is a necessary war to secure our peace. I find it interesting that as this young democracy has taken hold, radicals and extremists kill innocent people to stop its advance. And that ought to be a clear signal to the American people that these are dangerous people. And their ambition is not just contained to Iraq; their ambition is to continue to hurt the American people. My attitude is we ought to defeat them there so we don't have to face them here, and that we ought to defeat their ideology with a more hopeful form of government. QUESTION: Mr. President, you're facing a rebellion from Republican -- key Republican senators who want you to change course and begin reducing the U.S. combat role. Given the mixed report that you present today, how do you persuade Republicans to stick with you as they look ahead to the next elections? BUSH: A couple of things. First of all, I respect those Republicans that you're referring to. I presume you're referring to friends of mine, like Lugar -- Senator Lugar, Domenici. These are good, honorable people. I've spoken to them. And I listened very carefully to what they have to say. First of all, they share my concern that a precipitous withdrawal would embolden Al Qaida. And they also understand that we can't let Al Qaida gain safe haven inside of Iraq. I appreciate, you know, their calls, and I appreciate their -- their desire to work with the White House to be in a position where we can sustain a presence in Iraq. What I tell them is this, just what I've told you, is that as the commander in chief of the greatest military ever I have an obligation, a sincere and serious obligation to hear out my commander on the ground. And I will take his recommendation -- and as I mentioned, to talk to Bob Gates about it, as well as the Joint Chiefs about it, as well as consult with members of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats -- as I make a decision about the way forward in Iraq. And so, you know, I value the advice of those senators. I appreciate their concerns about the situation in Iraq. And I'm going to continue listening to them. QUESTION: Mr. President, in addition to members of your own party, the American public is clamoring for a change of course in Iraq. Why are you so resistant to that idea, and how much longer are you willing to give the surge to work before considering a change in this policy? BUSH: First of all, I understand why the American people are -- you know, they're tired of the war. People are -- there's war fatigue in America. It's affecting our psychology. I've said this before. I understand that. This is an ugly war. It's a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men, women and children in order to achieve a political objective. It doesn't surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people. Part of that concern is whether or not we can win, whether or not the objective is achievable. People don't want our troops in harm's way if that which we're trying to achieve can't be accomplished. I feel the same way. I cannot look a mother and father of a troop in the eye and say, I'm sending your kid into combat, but I don't think we can achieve the objective. I wouldn't do that to a parent or a husband or a wife of a soldier. I believe we can succeed, and I believe we are making security progress that will enable the political track to succeed as well. And the report, by the way, which is -- as accurately noted as being submitted today -- is written a little less than a month after the full complement of troops arrived. I went to the country and said, I have made this decision. I said, What was happening on the ground is unsatisfactory in Iraq. In consultation with a lot of folks, I came to the conclusion that we needed to send more troops into Iraq, not less, in order to provide stability, in order to be able to enhance the security of the people there. And David asked for a certain number of troops. David Petraeus asked for a certain number. General Petraeus asked for a certain number of troops. And he just got them a couple of weeks ago. Military -- it takes a while to move our troops, as the experts know. You just can't load them all in one airplane or one big ship and get them into theater. They had to stage the arrival of our troops. And after they arrived in Iraq, it took a while to get them into their missions. Since the reinforcements arrived, things have changed. For example, I would remind you that Anbar province was considered lost. Maybe some of you reported that last fall. And yet today, because of what we call bottom-up reconciliation, Anbar province has changed dramatically. The same thing is now beginning to happen in Diyala province. There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where violence is down. There are still car bombs, most of which have the Al Qaida signature on them. But they're declining, you know. So there's some measurable progress. And you ask: How long does one wait? I will repeat as the commander in chief of a great military who has supported this military and will continue to support this military, not only with my -- with insisting that we get resources to them, but with -- but by respecting the command structure, I'm going to wait for David to come back -- David Petraeus to come back and give us the report on what he sees. And then we'll use that data, that -- his report, to work with the rest of the military chain of command and members of Congress to, you know, making another decision, if need be. QUESTION: You talk about all the troops now being in place, and only in place for the last three weeks or a month. Yet, three- quarters of the troops for the surge were in place during the period when this July interim report was written. Are you willing to keep the surge going, no matter what General Petraeus says, if there is no substantial Iraqi political progress by September? BUSH: You're asking me to speculate on what my frame of mind will be in September. And I would just ask that you give General Petraeus to come back and brief me. And then, of course, I'll be glad to answer your questions along that line. QUESTION: But there's been no -- but there has been no substantial political progress, even with three-quarters of the troops in there. BUSH: Well, as I mentioned... QUESTION: So can you keep that going through September even if there isn't... BUSH: As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have felt all along that the security situation needed to change in order for there to be political progress. It's very hard for a young democracy to function with the violence that was raging. Secondly, there's a lot of the past that needs to be worked through the system. Living under the brutal tyrant Saddam Hussein created a lot of anxiety and a lot of tensions and a lot of rivalry. And it's just -- it's going to take a while to work it through. But they couldn't work through those tensions and rivalries in the midst of serious violence. And so the strategy was: Move in more troops to cause the violence to abate. And that's what David Petraeus will be reporting on. QUESTION: Question for you about the process you're describing of your decision-making as commander in chief. Have you entertained the idea that at some point Congress may take some of that sole decision-making power away through legislation? And can you tell us: Are you still committed to vetoing any troop withdrawal deadline? BUSH: You mean in this interim period? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: I don't think Congress ought to be running the war. I think they ought to be funding our troops. I'm certainly interested in their opinion. But trying to run a war through resolution is a prescription for failure, as far as I'm concerned, and we can't afford to fail. I'll work with Congress. I'll listen to Congress. Congress has got all the right to appropriate money, but the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations, for example, or how to, you know, deal with troop strength is -- it's -- I -- I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it makes sense today, nor do I think it's a good precedent for the future. And so the role of the commander in chief is, of course, to consult with Congress. QUESTION: So if Reed-Levin or anything like it were to pass and set a -- BUSH: Well, I would hope they wouldn't pass, Jim. But I -- QUESTION: But -- BUSH: Let me make sure you understand what I'm saying. Congress has all the right in the world to fund. That's their main involvement in this war, which is to provide funds for our troops. What you're asking is whether or not Congress ought to be basically determining how troops are positioned, or troop strength. And I just -- I don't think that would be good for the country. David. QUESTION: Mr. President, you've said many times this war at this stage is about the Iraqi government creating a self-sustaining, stable government. Last November, your own CIA director, according to The Washington Post, told you about that government, quote, The inability of the government to govern seems irreversible. He could not point to any milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing around. And he said, in talking about the government, that, It's balanced, but it cannot function. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: When you heard that, since that point, you think of how many hundreds of soldiers have been killed, how much money has been spent, why shouldn't people conclude that you are either stubborn, in denial, but certainly not realistic about the strategy that you've pursued since then? BUSH: You know, it's interesting, it turns out Mike Hayden -- I think you're quoting Mike Hayden there -- was in this morning to give me his weekly briefing. And I asked him about that newspaper article from which you quote. His answer was his comments to the Iraq Study Group were a little more nuanced than the quotation you read. He said that he made it clear the current strategy in Iraq wasn't working. That's his recollection of the briefing to the Iraq Study Group. He briefed them to the fact that it wasn't working and that we needed a change of direction. He also said that those who suggest that we back away and let the Iraqis' government do it -- this is in November of 2006 -- let the Iraqis handle it, don't understand the inability of the Iraq government at that time to take on that responsibility. He then went on to say -- this is what he -- his recollection of this conversation was that our strategy needed to help get the violence down, so that there could be political reconciliation from the top down as well as the bottom up. There has been political reconciliation from the bottom up. Anbar province is a place where the experts had -- or an expert had said that it was impossible for us to achieve our objective. This is the -- part of the country of Iraq where Al Qaida had made it clear that they would like to establish a safe haven from which to plan and plot further attacks, to spread their ideology throughout the Middle East. Since then, since this November 2006 report and since that statement to the Iraq Study Group, things have changed appreciably on the ground in Anbar province. And they're beginning to have the same change (ph), because the people on the ground there are sick and tired of violence and being threatened by people like Al Qaida, who have no positive vision for the future. And there's been a significant turn, where now Sunni sheiks and Sunni citizens are working with the coalition to bring justice to Al Qaida killers. And that same approach is being taken in Diyala. And so there's a lot of focus -- and should be, frankly -- on oil laws or elections. But, remember, there's another political reconciliation track taking place as well, and that's the one that's taking place at the grassroots level. Mike Hayden talked about that as well. QUESTION: So you think you've been realistic about the strategy and what's possible? BUSH: Well -- thank you for the follow-up. Nothing's changed in the new room. Anyway, yes. I mean, as I told you last November right about this time, I was part of that group of Americans who didn't approve of what was taking place in Iraq because it looked like all the efforts that we had taken to that point in time were about to fail. In other words, sectarian violence was really raging. And I had a choice to make, and that was to pull back, as some suggested, and hope that the chaos and violence that might occur in the capital would not spill out across the country, or send more troops in to prevent the chaos and violence from happening in the first place. And that's the decision I made, so it was a realistic appraisal by me. What's realistic as well is to understand the consequences of what will happen if we fail in Iraq. In other words, it's -- people aren't just going to be content with driving America out of Iraq; Al Qaida wants to hurt us here. That's their objective. That's what they'd like to do. They have got an ideology that they believe that the world ought to live under, and that one way to help spread that ideology is to harm the American people, harm American interests. The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11, and that's why what happens in Iraq matters to security here at home. So I've been realistic about the consequences of failure. I have been realistic about what needs to happen on the ground in order for there to be success. And it's been hard work. And the American people see it as hard work. And one of the reasons it's hard work is because on our TV screens are these violent killings perpetuated by people who have done us harm in the past. And that ought to be a lesson for the American people to understand that what happens in Iraq and overseas matters to the security of the United States of America. QUESTION: On that point, what evidence can you present to the American people that the people who attacked the United States on September 11th are, in fact, the same people who are responsible for the bombings taking place in Iraq? What evidence can you present? And also, are you saying, sir, that Al Qaida in Iraq is the same organization being run by Osama bin Laden himself? BUSH: Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And the guys who had perpetuated the attacks on America -- obviously, the guys on the airplane are dead. And the commanders, many of those are either dead or in captivity -- like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. But the people in Iraq, Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And we need to take Al Qaida in Iraq seriously, just like we need to take Al Qaida anywhere in the world seriously. QUESTION: Mr. President, in Jordan in November you stood by Prime Minister Maliki and said, He's the right guy for Iraq. Given this report card today and given the lack of top-down political reconciliation, can you tell the American people that you still believe he's the right guy for Iraq? BUSH: I believe that he understands that there needs to be serious reconciliation and they need to get law passed, I firmly believe that. I have had a series of conference calls with the prime minister, as well as the presidency council. In the presidency council, you would have the president, Talabani. You'd have the two vice presidents, Mahdi and Hashemi, as well as the prime minister. And I have urged them to work together to get law passed. It's not easy to get law passed in certain legislatures, like theirs. There's a lot of work that has to be done. And I will continue to urge... QUESTION: Do you have confidence in them? BUSH: Let me just -- I'm almost through with the first one, and I'll come back to the second one. And so I'll continue to urge the Iraqis to show us that they're capable of passing legislation. But it's not just us; it's the Iraqi people. And what really matters is whether or not life's improving for the Iraqi people on the ground. And, yes, I've got confidence in them. But I also understand how difficult it is. I'm not making any excuses, but it is hard. It's hard work for them to get law passed. And sometimes it's hard work for people to get law passed here. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to work to achieve an objective, which is a government that is able to, you know, provide security for its people and to provide basic services and, as importantly, serve as an ally against these extremists and radicals. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. BUSH: No, not you. QUESTION: I'd like to switch subjects. BUSH: OK, is that harsh? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: Like the new hall -- I should have been more gentle? Do we ever use kinder and gentler? No. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I could just switch subjects for a second to another big decision you made recently, which was in the Scooter Libby case, you spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation. But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisers, you know, leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator. Now that the case is over -- it's not something you've ever spoken to -- can you say whether you're at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisers? And have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way? BUSH: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during that time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person. And, you know, I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it has been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course, and now we're going to move on. Wendell. QUESTION: Mr. President, you have spoken passionately -- BUSH: Oh, I'm sorry, John. Okay. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. QUESTION: You're taking it away from me? BUSH: I am. QUESTION: After doing the fair and balanced, you're going to take -- BUSH: Yeah. (Laughs, laughter.) PRESS MEMBERS: Ohhh. QUESTION: (Off mike.) QUESTION: You were going to come back to me, sir. BUSH: You got the mike, then John, you're next. Possession deal, you know what I'm saying? QUESTION: Thank you, sir. You have spoken passionately about the consequences of failure in Iraq. Your critics say you failed to send enough troops there at the start, failed to keep al Qaeda from stepping into the void created by the collapse of Saddam's army, failed to put enough pressure on Iraq's government to make the political reconciliation necessary to keep the sectarian violence the country is suffering from now from occurring. So why should the American people feel you have the vision for victory in Iraq, sir? BUSH: Those are all legitimate questions that I'm sure historians will analyze. I mean, one of the questions is, should we have sent more in the beginning? Well, I asked that question, Do you need more? to General Tommy Franks. In the first phase of this operation, General Franks, you know, was obviously in charge. And during our discussions in the run-up to the decision to remove Saddam Hussein after he ignored the Security Council resolutions, my primary question to General Franks was: Do you have what it takes to succeed? And do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein? And his answer was yes. Now, history is going to look back to determine whether or not there might have been a different decision made. But at the time, the only thing I can tell you is that I relied upon military commander to make the proper decision about troop strength in acting. And I can remember meeting with the Joint Chiefs, who said: We've reviewed the plan, and seemed satisfied with it. I remember sitting in the PIAT (ph), or the situation room, downstairs here at the White House. And I went to commander and commander, that were all responsible for different aspects of the operation to remove Saddam. I said to each of them, Do you have what it takes? Are you satisfied with the strategy? And the answer was yes. We have worked hard to help this country reconcile. After all, they do have a modern constitution, which is kind of a framework for reconciliation. And after all, there was a significant series of votes where the people were given a chance to express their desire to live in a free society. As a matter of fact, 12 million Iraqis went to the polls. What happened then, of course, is that the enemy -- Al Qaida -- attacks the Samarra mosque, which of course created anxiety and anger amongst the Shia and then all of a sudden the sectarian violence began to spiral. Reconciliation hadn't taken hold deep enough in society to prevent this violence from taking hold. And so I have a -- you know, I've got to decide whether or not it's OK for that violence to continue or whether or not it makes sense for us to try to send more troops in to quell the violence, to give the reconciliation process further time to advance. My concern is that, as a result of violence and killing, there would be chaos. Now that's -- that's a state of affairs that thugs like Al Qaida need to survive, and they like chaos. As a matter of fact, they like to create chaos in order to create conditions of fear and anxiety and doubt. Out of that chaos could come a further escalation of violence in the Middle East, and this is what's important for the American people to understand. That violence and that chaos would embolden extremists groups, whether they be Shia or Sunni. And they would then get into competition with each other. Such chaos and violence would send a mixed signal to the Iranians, who have stated that they believe Israel ought to be wiped off the map. People would begin to wonder about America's resolve. Al Qaida would certainly be in a better position to raise money and recruit. And what makes all this scenario doubly dangerous is that they have proven themselves able to attack us and kill nearly 3,000 of our citizens, and they would like to do it again. And therefore the strategy has got to be to help this government become an ally against these people. What happens in Iraq -- and I understand how difficult it's been. It's been hard. I have received a lot of inspiration, however, from meeting with our troops, who understand the stakes of this fight, and meeting with their families. And, you know, we owe it to our troops to support our commanders: smart, capable people who are devising a strategy that will enable us to succeed and prevent the conditions I just talked about from happening. QUESTION: Your administration has cited Al Qaida leaders such as Zawahiri as saying that if we leave prematurely, it would be a glorious victory for Al Qaida. But the reason that we can't leave or haven't been able to leave is not because we're getting defeated in any way militarily, it's because the Iraqis can't get it together so far. So why can't we counter those messages and, obviously, not withdraw precipitously, but begin some sort of gradual withdrawal that prevents ethnic cleansing but also allows our military to get out? BUSH: Well, there's a lot of discussion about a scenario in which our troop posture would be to guard the territorial integrity of the country of Iraq, to embed and train, to help the Iraqi security forces deal with violent elements in their society, as well as keep enough special forces there to chase down Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, that is something that I've spoken publicly about, said that's a position I'd like to see us in. However, I felt like we needed to send more troops to be able to get the situation to quiet down enough to be able to end in that position. And in terms of my own decision-making, as I mentioned earlier, I definitely need to be in consultation, and will be, with General David Petraeus, who asked for the additional troops in the first place, troops which have been in place -- fully in place for about three weeks. And so, I would ask members of Congress to give the general a chance to come back and to give us a full assessment of whether this is succeeding or not. And it's at that point in time that I will consult with members of Congress and make a decision about the way forward, all aiming to succeed and making sure that Al Qaida and other extremists do not benefit from a decision I might have to make. Mark? QUESTION: Yes, sir, Mr. President. BUSH: Yes, sir, Mark. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: How come -- thank you. Thank you, sir. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: How comfortable are you -- sir, how comfortable are you with your homeland security secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you? BUSH: My gut tells me that -- which my head tells me as well -- is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida's a serious threat to our homeland. And we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with -- by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again. And so it's a serious issue that is going to outlast my presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is an ideological conflict that -- where you've got competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the assymetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and, you know, suicide bombers are the main -- the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve, you know, strategic objectives. Their objective is to impose their vision of the -- on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They -- they -- they -- they'd love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose, with the Taliban, on the -- on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interests to spread an alternative ideology. We have done this before in our nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century that we not forget that liberty can transform societies. Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation, you know, like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe -- strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just, you know, for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised -- I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were to defy that many, you know, threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised. And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists. It's a -- it is a -- it is a -- we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root. I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't because isolationist. That's why I told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the -- in the -- in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're -- one, we view them as strategic partners and secondly that we want them to work toward, you know, a freer societies and to help this Iraqi government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner. And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can -- I know we've got to achieve the objective so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, you know, do we do it now or basically, you know, pull back, let the Gallup poll or whatever poll there are decide the fate of the -- of the country. And my view is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves. Because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country. QUESTION: Good morning, Mr. President. Given the events on the ground in Iraq and the politics here at home, has U.S. military deployment to Iraq reached the ceiling or can you allow any further military escalation? BUSH: You're trying to do what Martha very skillfully tried to get me to do, and that was to... QUESTION: Can I have a follow-up? BUSH: Yes, you can, because you're about to realize I'm not going to answer your question.... (LAUGHTER) ... except to say this: There's going to be great temptation to -- not temptation. There will be -- you won't be tempted. You'll actually ask me to speculate about what David Petraeus will talk to us about when he comes home. And I just ask the American people to understand that the commander in chief must rely upon the wisdom and judgment of the military thinkers and planners. It's very important that there be that solid connection of trust between me and those who are in the field taking incredible risk. And so I'm going to wait to see what David has to say. I'm not going to pre-judge what he may say. I trust David Petraeus' judgment. He's an honest man. Those of you who have interviewed him know that he's a straight shooter, he is an innovative thinker. I was briefed by members of the CODEL that came back that said that it appeared to them that our troops have high respect for our commanders in Baghdad, as do I. Now, do you have a follow-up on perhaps another subject, another area, another... QUESTION: How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support? Are you personally -- do you ever have trouble balancing the -- between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public, which is really the essence of democracy? BUSH: Yes, it is. And, first of all, I can fully understand why people are tired of the war. The question they have is: Can we win it? And, of course, I'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight. I believe, however, that, when they really think about the consequences, if we were to precipitously withdraw, they begin to say themselves, maybe we ought to win this; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq. Their question, it seems like to me, is: Can we succeed? And that's a very important, legitimate question for anybody to ask. I think many people understand we must succeed. And I think a lot of people understand we've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions. I suspect -- I know this: that, if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war, they would be very concerned about the mission. In other words, if our troops said, Well, here we are in combat, and we've got a commander in chief who is, you know, running a focus group, in other words, Politics would be -- is more important to him than our safety and/or our strategy, that would dispirit our troops. And that's a lot of constituencies in this fight. Clearly, the American people, who are paying for this, is the major constituency. And I repeat to you, I understand that there -- this violence has affected them, and a lot of people don't think we can win. There's a lot of people in Congress who don't think we can win as well. And, therefore, their attitude is, Get out. My concern with that strategy, something that Mike Hayden also discussed, is that just getting out may sound simple, and it may affect polls, but it would have long-term, serious security consequences for the United States. And so sometimes you -- you know, you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right. My most important job is to help secure this country. And, therefore, the decisions in Iraq are all aimed in helping do that job and that's what I firmly believe. The second constituency is the military, and I repeat to you, I'm pretty confident our military do not want their commander in chief making political decisions about their future. A third constituency that matters to me a lot is military families. These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices, and they support their loved ones. And I don't think they want their commander in chief making decisions based upon popularity. Another constituency group that is important for me to talk to is the Iraqis. Obviously, I want the Iraqi government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation, top-down, that we want to see laws passed. I think they've got that message. They know full well that the American government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together. That's what the benchmarks are aimed to do. They also need to know that I'm making decisions based upon our security interests, of course, but also helping them to succeed and that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States. What will determine the course of action is: Will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run? And finally, another constituency is the enemy, who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them. And so that what's I think about. And, you know, I'm guess I'm like any other political figure. Everybody wants to be loved -- just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved. And so, when it's all said and done, if you ever come down and visit the old, tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say, I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle, not based upon politics. And that's important to me. Thank you all for your time. I loved being here at this new building. Thank you. QUESTION: Can I just ask you about the Al Qaida intelligence report, please? BUSH: What was that? QUESTION: The intelligence... BUSH: This is amazing. QUESTION: I know. I know. BUSH: The new me. (LAUGHTER) The Al Qaida intelligence report? QUESTION: The intelligence analysts are saying Al Qaida has reconstituted in areas of Pakistan, saying the threat to the West is greater than ever now -- well, as great as 2001. What's happened? You tell... BUSH: OK, I'm glad you asked. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that opportunity to... QUESTION: Thank you for coming back. BUSH: I'm happy to do it. This is not the new me. I mean, this is just an aberration. In other words... QUESTION: It's over, next time? BUSH: I'm not going to leave and then come back for somebody to yell something at me. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Yes, exactly. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Exactly. There is a perception in the coverage that Al Qaida may be as strong today as they were prior to September the 11th. That's just simply not the case. I think the report will say since 2001, not prior to September the 11th, 2001. Secondly, that because of the actions we've taken, Al Qaida is weaker today than they would have been. They are still a threat. They are still dangerous. And that is why it is important that we succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq and anywhere else we find them. And that's our strategy, is: to stay on the offense against Al Qaida. She asked the question, Is it Al Qaida in Iraq? Yes, it is Al Qaida, just like it's Al Qaida in parts of Pakistan. And I'm working with President Musharraf to be able to -- I mean, he doesn't want them in his country. He doesn't want foreign fighters in the outposts of his country, and so we're working to make sure that we continue to keep the pressure on Al Qaida. But, no question, Al Qaida is dangerous for the American people, and that's why -- as well as other people that love freedom. And that's why we're working hard with allies and friends to enhance our intelligence. That's why we need terrorist surveillance programs. That's why it's important to keep -- and I would hope Congress would modernize that bill, and that's why we're keeping on the offense. Ultimately, the way to defeat these radicals and extremists is to offer alternative ways of life so that they're unable to recruit, that they can use -- they like to use frustration and hopelessness. The societies that don't provide hope will become the societies were Al Qaida has got the capacity to convince a youngster to go blow himself up. What we need to do is help governments provide brighter futures for their people so they won't sign up. And the fundamental question facing the world in this issue is whether or not it makes sense to try to promote an alternative ideology. I happen to think it does. They say, He's idealistic. Yeah, I'm idealistic. But I'm also realistic in understanding if there's not an alternative ideology presented, these thugs'll be able to continue to recruit. They'll use hopelessness to be able to recruit. And so it's a -- thank you for asking that question. QUESTION: Is bin Laden... BUSH: Thank you all. QUESTION: Is bin Laden alive?

This week, City Room featured the reminiscences of New York Times journalists who covered the blackout. This is the final installment, following contributions from reporters Robert D. McFadden, Joyce Purnick, Ralph Blumenthal and James Barron.When all the lights gradually dimmed and then went out over the entire city, it felt unreal, gradually it grew to eerie, then it became surreal and finally it was downright scary. With neighborhoods lit by the headlamps of cars and flashlights and candles giving homes their only hope of light: it was an emotional roller coaster. I could appreciate the beauty of a pitch-dark night, which brought me back to my childhood, but in New York City, I was surrounded by a multitude of strangers, not the familiar faces of my small community in Alabama.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/the-77-blackout-citizens-as-traffic-cops/

The Washington Post noted the “goofy” shoes were spreading “like vermin,” and Radar Magazine anointed the “hideous” items “summer’s most unfortunate fad.” The good news for critics was that fads fade and that the Croc thing seemed to be at a peak. But a year later Crocs still have traction; in fact, the company’s sales through the first quarter of 2007 are roughly triple what they were for the same period in 2006, and imitations and knockoffs abound. The shoes might still end up as props at the kitschy ’00s-themed parties of future college students (worn with trucker hats for the guys and huge sunglasses for the ladies).

If your inner daemon requires more by way of appeasement or flattery, you have something in common with David Anderton, the antihero of Andrew O’Hagan’s superb new novel, “Be Near Me.” Anderton is a very depressed middle-aged priest who is transferred to a very depressed Scottish parish. A marriage made in a bishopric, if not quite hell: here, in Dalgarnock, on the Ayrshire coast, outside of Glasgow and directly across the water from Northern Ireland, he is greeted as “papish scum” by the Protestant majority, and generally regarded as too posh and too English, the second being a considerably less pardonable offense. That Anderton is himself part Scottish — he was born in Edinburgh — scarcely matters; he has Oxbridge seasoning and cultural airs. As a whiff of life elsewhere, such a man is meant to be suffered, and little more, by such a bitterly impoverished town. But it is Anderton’s own quiet perversity, his abiding sense of “homelessness,” as he puts it, and of a life unlived, that throws this relationship into total enmity and finally into chaos.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/Metcalf-t.html

They believe that what binds them together is not their great desire to achieve but the durability of a friendship that has lasted decades and that took root during their idyllic girlhoods in Virginia. Yet “The Best of Friends” seems to address ambititon as much as friendship, and how the drive to explore, and succeed, shaped these women — their relationships, careers and families — who entered the work force in the 1980s.This lively dual memoir presents their stories candidly, but it is a sign of uncertainty that the authors felt they could discuss their ambitious yearnings only through the prism of a gauzy, Hallmark-card-like friendship.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/Byer-t.html

That’s because the candidates who are at the moment best positioned for the nominations of their parties have surprisingly little of it. At a time when the nation looks for a leader to meet profound challenges to its decades-long dominance as an economic and military power, the five candidates who lead in state and national polls — Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney — have won a grand total of five statewide elections in their cumulative political careers and have served a combined 20 years in statewide office. (Fred Thompson, who may soon be among the leaders in the Republican field, served eight years in the Senate.) In fact, the executive with the longest tenure in the group is Giuliani, who would be the first mayor in history to ascend to the presidency without holding some higher office first. Meanwhile, candidates with long careers spent mastering foreign and domestic policy, like Joe Biden and John McCain, have been flailing. In a round of television ads that feel more like a cry for help than a campaign pitch, Bill Richardson — the two-term governor of New Mexico and a former congressman, U.N. ambassador and energy secretary — sits in a drab office somewhere (Iowa, perhaps?), enthusiastically showing off his résumé while a clueless middle manager, entirely uninterested, rushes him along.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/magazine/15wwln-lede-t.html

The Pakistani Parliament passed a resolution condemning the knighthood, while the minister of religious affairs suggested it would justify future suicide bombings.

2007-07-16,Paperback Row,"THE AFTERLIFE, by Donald Antrim. (Picador, $13. ) An acclaimed novelist, Antrim reckons with his complicated grief in this tender, often darkly comic memoir. “The Afterlife” is dominated by his mother, Louanne — an artist, teacher and emotionally volatile alcoholic — who married and separated from Antrim’s father twice and died of lung cancer in 2000. Antrim’s first chapter announces his mother’s death, in Black Mountain, N.C., then changes the subject to his neurotic, ill-fated attempts to buy a bed. (“I felt, in some substantive yet elusive way, that I had had a hand in killing my mother. And so the search for a bed became the search for sanctuary.” ) Our reviewer, A. O. Scott, said that “one of the stories being told here … is of the emergence of Antrim’s sensibility as a novelist — his characteristic blend of the arch and the outré.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/0715bb-paperback.html

This is just my slightly smart-alecky way of suggesting that the impending end of the Harry Potter series means that all the other writers of children’s adventure and fantasy novels can start to edge out from under Rowling’s enormous shadow. So while it may seem like only due diligence to point out that, like Harry Potter, Torak — the young protagonist of Michelle Paver’s new novel, the third in her series of late-Neolithic-era adventures, “Chronicles of Ancient Darkness” — is a mystically gifted boy who has some very nasty enemies who killed his father and want him dead as well, the fact remains that this premise is not (dare I say it) original to the Potter books. And at any rate, as Paver’s hugely entertaining series demonstrates, she has found a clever new angle for an old and eternally meaningful story.

Guitar-based indie-rock holds the plurality, of course: retro shoegazer guitar squall from the Twilight Sad, British-flavored mope-rock — tinged with emo loquacity — from Voxtrot, the dazed slide-guitar lines of Beach House. But a festival this self-conscious strives for eclecticism, and Pitchfork places some markers in other genres. There’s hip-hop with De La Soul, the Clipse and Cadence Weapon, jazz with Ken Vandermark and William Parker, electronica with Girl Talk, Junior Boys and a party-starting character called Dan Deacon, whom I heard but didn’t see because he was engulfed in the audience for most of his set, which included a dance contest. Still, Pitchfork could have taken a further step: It could have booked a band that doesn’t sing in English, perhaps latching on to one of the bands that’s playing the Latin Alternative Music Conference this weekend in New York City.

David Enright, a London-based human-rights lawyer, told The Associated Press, “The material suggests that Africans are subhumans, they are imbeciles, that they’re half-savage.” A statement on the Little, Brown Web site, www.hachettebookgroupusa.com, says that the story “may be considered somewhat controversial, as it reflects the colonial attitudes of the time it was created.” Last week Borders stores in London shifted the book to the graphic-novels shelves from the children’s section. Borders in the United States said on Monday that it would follow suit because the book “could be considered offensive by some of our customers.” It added, “We believe adults have the capacity to evaluate the work within historical context and make their own decision whether to read it or not.” Sales in Britain soared 3,800 percent last week after the Commission for Racial Equality, a watchdog organization, said “Tintin in the Congo” was racist, Agence France-Presse reported.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/arts/18arts-ATINTINCONTR_BRF.html

Alfred Noll, the lawyer for the heirs, said he was making their claim public after two years of private lobbying because the city council was dragging its feet and the case was “going nowhere.” He said, “The goal is to free the paintings from Linz.” Mayor Franz Dobusch said in a statement that the city would accelerate its investigation of the ownership of the paintings. “The city of Linz is not trying to violently defend a picture,” he said, “but it aims to determine objectively whether there is a case for restituting them.” The Klimt painting is an unfinished portrait of Ria Munk, above, the daughter of an Austrian Jewish industrialist. The Nolde oil, dated 1915 and titled “May Meadow,” was once owned by Fred Julius of Hamburg, a Jewish physician and major patron of Die Brücke (The Bridge), a Dresden-based group of Expressionist artists.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/arts/18arts-HEIRSSEEKRET_BRF.html

For a Tour de France rider whose job is to support his team leader, the object is survival. Each day’s stage has a time limit based on a combination of the stage's difficulty and the winner's time and speed. Finishing after that time means automatic elimination, so on the tough mountain stages, support riders often form a grupetto - a group dedicated solely to finishing within the time limit. On the difficult 9th stage on Tuesday across the Iseran and the Galibier, two mountain passes in the Alps rated “beyond category” in difficulty, the grupetto -- 73 of the 171 riders in the race -- finished 28 minutes and 51 seconds behind the stage winner.

Only one publisher spotted the fakes, which included the famous opening line of “Pride and Prejudice” (1813): “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.” Mr. Lassman, who planted the line in a submission he had retitled “First Impressions,” told The Guardian of London: “I was staggered. Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived, with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one recipient recognized them as Austen’s work.” That editor was Alex Bowler of Jonathan Cape, who wrote: “Thank you for sending us the first two chapters of ‘First Impressions.’ My first impression on reading these were ones of disbelief and mild annoyance, along, of course, with a moment’s laughter. I suggest you reach for your copy of ‘Pride and Prejudice,’ which I’d guess lives in close proximity to your typewriter, and make sure your opening pages don’t too closely mimic that book’s opening.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/arts/20arts-NOCENSUREFOR_BRF.html

Eliot Spitzer and the leaders of the State Legislature agreed to the broadest overhaul in 30 years of the state’s famously lax campaign finance laws. As Danny Hakim and Nicholas Confessore report, the agreement would ban contributions from registered lobbyists; substantially reduce the amount of money most donors can give (though not by as much as the governor and government watchdog groups wanted); require donors to disclose their occupation and employer; establish a schedule for more frequent filing of reports of contributions to and spending by candidates; and bar donations from limited liability companies that lack real assets.In other Albany news, Mr. Spitzer and the leaders of the Assembly and the Senate agreed to establish a 17-member New York City Traffic Mitigation Commission to come up with a plan to reduce traffic congestion in Manhattan, subject to approval by the City Council and the Legislature, by next March. The compromise is similar to a plan that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had criticized as inadequate earlier this week, but nonetheless, the mayor and advocacy groups that support the charges called the deal a victory, saying it would allow the city to compete for some $500 million in federal transportation grants. (The mayor and federal officials had insisted that Monday was the deadline to apply for those grants; how fixed that deadline is remains unclear.)

2007-07-23,"Bonds vs. Reporters, Part 313","Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants took aim at a familiar target on Saturday. Not a pitcher, not Commissioner Bud Selig and not Hank Aaron. Bonds spent most of a 20-minute pregame session with reporters taking jabs at them.“I got to have my tape recorder because some of you are downright dirty,” said Bonds, who tapes interview sessions and posts the audio on his Web site. “You all keep saying what you say and I’ll keep recording it.”Between Bonds’s sometimes playful, sometimes serious shots at reporters inside the visiting clubhouse at Miller Park, he discussed a myriad of topics. Bonds, who is three homers from passing Aaron’s career record of 755, said he was happy that Selig attended Friday’s game. Selig was here Saturday, too.When Bonds was asked if he wanted to talk to Selig, he said, “About what? We haven’t talked in a while. But I have respect for Bud. Like I said before, I don’t care what you say or what you write. Bud has always been nice to me, always been nice to my father. I like Bud.”Bonds reiterated that he respects Selig and would not lose respect for Selig if the commissioner does not shadow Bonds for his record-breaking game. Selig is expected to follow Bonds’s hunt for 756.If Bonds breaks Aaron’s record and Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees chases Bonds down, Bonds repeated that he would be in the front row to watch Rodriguez.“This is our fraternity,” Bonds said. “If we don’t stand for each other, who is going to stand behind us? I’ll stand behind a fellow player, regardless.”Using that logic, is Aaron refusing to stand behind Bonds by not going to Bonds’s games?“I don’t know,” Bonds said. “The thing is, we respect Hank regardless. Like I’ve said before, it’s not fair, in a sense, if you’re asking somebody to take away whatever they have to do. You can’t predict something like this.”Bonds said he feels good when he is “by myself” and added that he feels best when he is “just like the other 24 people in here.” Since Bonds has long had more privileges than any other Giant, it was a curious statement. Bonds has never wanted to be treated like every another player.Since Bonds is not scheduled to start on Sunday, his next appearance in left field will probably be on Monday. The Giants return to AT&T Park for seven games, a perfect time for Bonds to eclipse Aaron because he would be assured of being cheered. But Bonds was not predicting a timetable for the historic homer.“Everybody who goes through milestones, go back and look at it, it takes a while,” Bonds said.When someone reminded Bonds that the national reporters who are covering him would disperse once he gets to 756, he invited them to leave now.“You all hate me anyway,” Bonds said. “I don’t know why you’re here anyway. Most of you say whatever nasty things you say about me anyway. If you really, truly believe all the things you write, why are you talking to me anyway?”",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/bonds-vs-reporters-part-313/

Over here, he’s better known as the guy who traveled from the Baseball Hall of Fame to evangelical megachurches to Las Vegas lap-dance parlors researching his book “American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville,” which earned him a spot on the Times best-seller list (and, in these pages, a memorable trip to the woodshed courtesy of Garrison Keillor). This week, Lévy takes the measure of the newly elected French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy’s candidacy divided France’s left-leaning intelligentsia, with a number of Lévy’s fellow “new philosophers” — as the anti-Communist thinkers who came of age in the 1970s are known — declaring their support. But despite sympathy with Sarkozy’s foreign policy and “anti-anti-American” outlook, Lévy could not endorse the tough-talking conservative.

2007-07-23,Young Climbers in Love,"Say what you will about Samantha Joyce, the 20-something health policy adviser who rides again in “Sammy’s House” — the second installment in what threatens to become a long-running D.C. chick-lit saga — but she’s certainly an authentic Washington type. As conceived by Kristin Gore, the daughter of a certain former vice president, Sammy is at once self-effacing and self-important, frivolous and pedantic, furiously partisan and convinced of her own unbiased high-mindedness. She’s the sort of disingenuous, “What, me ambitious?” climber you never want to share a cab or a greenroom with, or get trapped having drinks with at a Capitol Hill bar. Indeed, only the assumption that Gore intends her protagonist to be essentially appealing, and her adventures to be madcap and winning and laugh-out-loud funny, leads me to see this book as an exceedingly tedious comedy of manners rather than a cutting, realistic portrait of a rising young hack.

2007-07-23,Tennis Nonwhites,"From the start of their professional tennis careers, Venus and Serena Williams seemed totally certain they were champions; they marched through the tennis world with the ferocity of the young Mike Tyson. James Blake was No. 9 in the world at the conclusion of Wimbledon this month; late last year he was No. 4. But only twice in his career has he reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal, and many have long sensed that his potential has been limited because he doesn’t truly believe he belongs in big-time tennis. He’s cursed with the unsureness of Dave Chappelle. Blake confirms this in his memoir, “Breaking Back” (written with Andrew Friedman), when, early in his career, he drops a winnable match to the great Patrick Rafter. “After the match, as we shook hands at the net, he leaned in close, the zinc oxide he smeared under his eyes like war paint runny with sweat: ‘You could have beaten me today,’ he said, surprising me, ‘but I had the sense that maybe you didn’t believe it yourself.’ He paused, then said, ‘Now do you believe?’ ... He perceived something about me that I wasn’t even admitting to myself: I didn’t really believe that I belonged out there with the best players in the world. I didn’t feel like I deserved to win.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Toure-t.html

2007-07-23,"Noir and the City: Dark, Dangerous, Corrupt and Sexy","GUILT, desire, fear, ambition and the bad behavior those human frailties give rise to are the favored themes of the sort of film we now call noir. So it’s hardly surprising that a fair number of these pictures are set in New York City, where guilt, fear, desire, ambition and bad behavior are pretty much a way of life. Any city will do, of course, because all cities generate a certain amount of the anxiety that film noir feeds on. And all cities, somewhere, have dark, scary streets that can, in noir’s violent allegories of moral ambiguity, stand in for the dimmer, grubbier recesses of the soul. But New Yorkers pride themselves on having more of everything than people in other cities do. If noir is the great urban style of the movies — and it is — then New York City is surely the noirest place on earth.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/movies/22raff.html

Their offenses ranged from fondling girls a few years younger than they were to outright rape of young children. As part of their treatment, the boys had to keep journals — which Longo read — in which they detailed their sexual fantasies and logged how frequently they masturbated to those fantasies. They created “relapse-prevention plans,” based on the idea that sex-offending is like an addiction and that teenagers need to be watchful of any “triggers” (pornography, anger) that might initiate their “cycle” of reoffending. And at the beginning of each group session, the boys introduced themselves much as an alcoholic begins an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting: “I’m Brian, and I’m a sex offender.

Walker’s gang targets this particular landmark, Doctorow writes, because “more than any mayor or governor,” J. Pierpont Morgan “represented in Coalhouse’s mind the power of the white world.” Yet unbeknownst to the fictional musician (and perhaps to his creator), the library, this symbol of white power, was in no small part the achievement of Belle da Costa Greene (1879-1950), a woman of color.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Weber-t.html

2007-07-23,‘The House That George Built’," There are several ways of defining and measuring an era, but an excellent place to start is by checking out the media of the day and what they could or could not do at the moment. For example, when sound recording first came along, the singers belted into it as if performing to an empty stadium. The name that springs to mind is Caruso, the world's biggest voice. But with the coming of microphones in the 1920s, singing became more personal, and the name became Bing Crosby, the world's friendliest voice. So songs became brisker and less operatic, to suit not only the mike but the piano rack and the record cabinet. In short, the familiar thirty-two-bar song, which now seems to have been fixed in the stars, was actually fixed by the practicalities of sheet-music publishing and confirmed by the limitations of ten-inch records.

Until the woman whipped off her tailored black jacket to reveal a star-spangled bra and a surprisingly elaborate dragon tattoo, the only remarkable thing about this cruise was that it was nineteen months late. The celebratory boat ride had been promised long ago, in the first month of our new administration, but no one minded that the business of running the country had continuously delayed its actual launch.

Nostalgia for the past, the love of epic stories, and the presence in the party of mythical and charismatic speakers are all part of the Gaullist legacy.

But for three nights, culminating on Double Seven-the seventh day of the seventh month, the day of the lovers' festival, and my birthday-I would actually see the opera, which was normally forbidden to girls and women.

(Vintage, $14.95. ) This masterly comedy of manners captures New York’s chattering class in the months before and immediately following Sept. 11. Messud intertwines the stories of three friends — Danielle Minkoff, Marina Thwaite and Julius Clarke — who are entitled but floundering Brown graduates on the cusp of their 30s and “torn between Big Ideas and a party.” The despot of the title is Marina’s father, Murray Thwaite, a legendary journalist and cultural critic whose family is upended by two ambitious interlopers: Ludovic Seeley, an Australian magazine editor; and Murray’s nephew Frederick Tubb, a college dropout who yearns to become Murray’s disciple. The Book Review named “The Emperor’s Children” one of the top 10 books of 2006. “Claire Messud is a novelist of unnerving talent,” Meghan O’Rourke wrote here.

Don’t forget to hit your “refresh” or “F5″ button to keep up with the action.***FINAL 2-1. Argentina wins. The Czech Republic started the second half brightly with a few good chances followed by an excellent turnaround volley from Martin Fenin. They had dealt well with the relatively lifeless Argentina attack. With the lead, they suddenly looked good for the win. For one second. But during that one second, they forgot to defend, and they paid. Banega’s perfect pass gave Aguero the only chance he needed, and he buried it. Then the floodgates were open, and Maxi Moralez, with his head wrapped in a white bandage, took the reins. Argentina controlled the ball for most of the last half-hour, and they deserved the winner in the end. It was a contrast in styles and a see-sawing match. Congrats to the Czechs.

Besides requests for mamma’s recipe for spaghetti all’amatriciana (a bacon and tomato sauce typical of the Lazio region), call center workers had plenty of stories for the Messagero reporter: the concerned citizen who phoned in to report a “suspicious looking pigeon” during the bird flu scare; the motorist who called to find out whether zero is an odd or an even number, during a day where traffic was limited to odd number license plates. In fact, calling 060606 is extremely useful if you live in Rome and are forced to navigate the capital’s bureaucratic intricacies on a regular basis. It also provides information on other sundry questions, like where to pick up a parked car that’s been towed away, or where to bring a pigeon with a broken wing (the bird center next to the zoo, as it happens). But tourists may find it useful, too (though for information on exhibitions and museum hours and other similar queries, callers are rerouted to a tourist information line – 06 82059127 – which operates daily from 9 AM to 7:30 PM). If you’re calling from a fixed dial phone, the calls cost the local rate.

Congress uses censure to punish its own members, not members of other branches. It has only been used once against a president — in 1834 against Andrew Jackson — and the succeeding Congress vacated it.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/827/

Peter Liguori, chairman of Fox Entertainment, said that even before a gunman killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech in April, Josh Friedman, an executive producer of the series, explained his reasons for a scene in which John is attacked at high school. “This woman is charged with protecting and preparing her son to be the future leader of the resistance,” Mr. Liguori told a meeting of the Television Critics Association. “The one single place a parent has to give up control of their child is school.” He added that Mr. Friedman, who regarded the episode as central to the program’s theme, was the first to acknowledge that the scene should be revised after the Virginia shootings. But Mr. Liguori did not detail the extent of the changes.

Leavy, executive vice president of Discovery Communications. “Moving forward, the program will be completely transparent in its promotion and all elements of the filming will be explained to our viewers.” The show follows Mr. Grylls as he is deposited in wilderness areas without much more than a flint, water bottle and knife; he must find his way out, sometimes eating the heads of live frogs or sleeping in freezing temperatures. But The Sunday Times of London reported this week that a consultant on the show, Mark Weinert, said that Mr. Grylls spent nights in a motel in Hawaii instead of on a deserted island, as depicted on the series, and that for an episode filmed in the Sierra Nevada, Mr. Grylls stayed at a resort. When interviewed in June by The New York Times, Mr. Grylls said the conditions did not change regardless of whether the cameras were on or off. Mr. Leavy said Mr. Grylls, who did not respond to e-mail requests for an interview, was on vacation.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/arts/25arts-TOUGHGUYFACE_BRF.html

Five years after a prostatectomy, about 18 percent of men under the care of an inexperienced surgeon, those with no more than 10 prior operations, were more likely to see signs that cancer had returned, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center researchers in New York said. Prostate cancer affects more than 218,000 American men each year, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation Web site.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/26/health/26brfs-EXPERIENCEMA_BRF.html

2007-07-26,Manhattan: Rights Group Seeks Police Records,"The New York Civil Liberties Union has filed a public records request asking the Police Department to turn over computerized data on stop-and-frisk activities so it can analyze the role that race plays in such street stops. Asked if the department would comply, its spokesman, Paul J. Browne, pointed out that the department had already turned over reports on its raw data to the City Council, as required by law. The reports showed a fivefold increase in the number of stop-and-frisks from 2002 to last year, with more than half of them involving black residents. The civil liberties group wants to analyze each of the 508,540 street stops last year, as well as those from the first half of this year. The department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to conduct an independent assessment of the stops, Mr. Browne said. He added, “In terms of race, the data showed that stops were consistent proportionately with descriptions provided by victims of violent crime.” The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday that the Council expected the police to provide the data to citizens and that if they did not, the Council would “take appropriate action.”",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/26/nyregion/26mbrfs-records.html

The war, Bush announced, would begin with Al Qaeda, but would “not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.” The global war on terror, he said, was the “inescapable calling of our generation.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Power-t.html

In short, Epstein knew, the research done by Maxine Ankrah, an African-American academic, would give invaluable insights into what had halted the epidemic — insights that could then be applied to other countries with high rates of H.I.V. and AIDS.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Donnelly-t.html

She also consulted for the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Later this year she will become a foreign policy columnist for Time magazine, and she is completing work on a new book, “Chasing the Flame: Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World,” about the United Nations peacemaker killed by a suicide bomb in Iraq. She views his death in August 2003 as a turning point in a war she calls “the greatest strategic blunder in the history of U.S. foreign policy.” Like Washington’s history of ignoring genocide, Power says, the Iraq war is “further proof” of the need to overcome the United States government’s “systemic insensitivity to human consequences.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Upfront-t.html

2007-07-30,36 Hours in Edinburgh,"EVERY August, the global theatrical community — well, at least the part that is drawn to an all-male, musical version of Chekhov's “Three Sisters” — heads to the Scottish capital of Edinburgh for a monthlong celebration of the dramatic arts, from world premieres by celebrated authors to one-man shows by unknown novices. The main event is the Edinburgh International Festival, which next month will feature such productions as “Orpheus X,” a modern-day telling of the Orpheus myth, and a Mabou Mines staging of “A Doll's House.” But for many people, the real draw is the Fringe, a riotous collection of performances all around the city by hundreds of performance artists, comedians, memoirists and monologuists. The crux of the action is at the Assembly Rooms (54 George Street), one of several places where tickets are sold each day, and where hundreds of festivalgoers gather each morning — almost like theatrical futures traders — to swap information about what is causing the latest buzz, what's a must-see and what's turned out to be a flop. The great thing about many of these shows is that they often run an hour or so, and thus you know that even the most painful theatrical experience will soon come to an end if you've chosen unwisely. (Though I did once earn the lasting enmity of one playwright whose tortured attempts to tell a coherent story were so inept that I walked out about halfway through the show. The fact that there were only four other people in the audience might be why he glared at me so intently as I gently closed the theater door behind me.) Still, Edinburgh, even in August, is more than just about sitting in darkened theaters all day. The city itself beckons, and often provides the perfect kicker to a day spent discovering an amazing new talent, or the perfect antidote to a theatrical experiment gone horribly, horribly wrong.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/travel/29hours.html

However, if you look at the word spork in the Oxford English Corpus, a 1.8-billion-word database of written and spoken English, and see how people actually write and talk about sporks, you find that 24 percent of the uses of the word spork involve violence. (In fact, some of the most common things to be sporked, far ahead of coleslaw, are eyeballs.) Now, obviously, most of this sporking is facetious, done purely for humorous intent (none of the eyeballs being sporked were in news reports), but the phenomenon of the weaponized spork is one that passed lexicographers and language researchers by until we saw the corpus evidence.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/magazine/29wwln-guest-t.html

2007-07-30,Inside the List,"MAIL FROM EUDORA: Annie Dillard’s new novel, “The Maytrees,” was No. 30 on last week’s hardcover fiction extended list — this week it drops off. As Julia Reed mentions in her review of the novel, Dillard’s second book, “Pilgrim at Tinker Creek” (1974), was reviewed in these pages by Eudora Welty. The review was long and often admiring, but definitely mixed. “The writing here leaves something to be desired,” Welty wrote at one point. Elsewhere, she noted the book’s tonal shifts: “You might be reading letters home from camp, where the moment before you might have thought you were deep in the Book of Leviticus.” “Pilgrim at Tinker Creek” went on to win a Pulitzer Prize, but it did not appear on the Times best-seller list. Some of Dillard’s later books did, though: two books of nonfiction, “An American Childhood” (1987) and “The Writing Life” (1989), and one novel, “The Living” (1992).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/29tbr.html

Piffle, snorted Frank Lloyd Wright, in a rejoinder published a few months later. Wright protested that the urban future, at least our American urban future, would in all likelihood spread out horizontally, not vertically, formed by what he saw as the utterly modern trend of decentralization in just about everything: transportation, communication and technology. “Broadacre City,” he called his vision, later amplified in a treatise titled “The Disappearing City.” He wrote of “giant roads” separating and uniting the farm and factory “units” with the “dwelling places,” which would be acre-square plots of house and cultivated ground, and of a “city” with no edge, one that went on forever.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Green-t.html

Ford boasts in its ads that “It’s Easy Being Green,” but residents feared the request suggested something not so easy at all. From the mid-1950s to the late 1970s, Ford operated an assembly plant in northern New Jersey, in nearby Mahwah, that cranked out millions of passenger cars. Ford closed the plant in 1980, after dumping what the E.P.A. describes as thousands of tons of paint sludge and other waste in Upper Ringwood, a community of about 350 working-class residents located in the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/business/yourmoney/29spill.html

2007-07-30,Paperback Row," JAMES TIPTREE, JR.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon, by Julie Phillips. (Picador, $18. ) By the early 1970s, James Tiptree Jr. was one of the brightest-burning talents in science fiction, conjuring interplanetary gender-bending fantasies that rev olutionized the genre. But in 1976, Tiptree was revealed to be Alice Sheldon, an enigmatic woman who had also been, in her colorful career, a psychologist, a C.I.A. counterintelligence analyst and a chicken farmer. This fascinating portrait by Phillips (inset) traces the life and work of a woman who found in her invented persona a partial resolution to the conflicts that plagued her throughout her life.

Northwest then “thinned the July schedule in anticipation of staffing challenges,” Mr. Steenland told employees. The Northwest branch of the Air Line Pilots Association said in late June that Northwest was unfairly blaming pilots for problems caused primarily by insufficient staff in a system with “no slack.” Northwest crews have been routinely reaching their maximum monthly limits on work hours near the end of a month.
