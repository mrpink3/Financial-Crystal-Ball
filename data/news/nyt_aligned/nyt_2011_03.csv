Some facts (some big ones) from Sacks’s essay, “The Last Hippie,” seem to have been altered and molded into a workable movie narrative, naturally, and I worry that Sacks’s poignantly honest account will have received a Hollywood face-lift.

2011-03-03,Adele Is No. 1,"Adele, the British singer who won the Grammy Award for best new artist two years ago, is the big winner on the Billboard chart this week, with a No. 1 opening for her new album and a rebound for her last one. Adele’s new album, “21” (XL/Columbia), opened with 352,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Thanks to a blitz of television appearances to promote the album, that was the best opening-week sales of any album in three months. (In the interim, there have been some painfully low numbers.) And her debut album, “19,” bolted 34 spots to No. 16, with 18,000 sales. But almost everything else on the chart is a loser. Last week’s No. 1, Justin Bieber’s “Never Say Never: The Remixes” (Island), fell to No. 2 with 102,000, a 38 percent decline, and Mr. Bieber’s “My World 2.0,” at No. 5, lost 22 percent. Mumford & Sons’ “Sigh No More” (Glassnote), at No. 3, dropped 46 percent; “Now That’s What I Call Music!” Vol. 37 is No. 4 with a 38 percent loss; Bruno Mars’s “Doo-Wops & Hooligans” (Elektra), at No. 6, lost 40 percent, and so on. Last week’s numbers were higher than usual because of the traditional retail boost the week after the Grammys. But that only underlines the scale of Adele’s success. On the digital singles chart, Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way,” which was enormously popular out of the gate, lost 44 percent of its sales in its third week, with 286,000, although that was enough for it to hold at No. 1.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/adele-is-no-1/

And it wasn’t only the ancient Greeks who used their memories in such a fashion. There are still vestiges of the vast bodies of knowledge that must have been common place in preliterate cultures. There are still a handful of Pacific Islanders who can navigate based on the precise position and distance of the stars above the horizon and on their knowledge of tides and currents. In many Muslim countries, it is commonplace for children no older than 10 or 12 to have memorized the entire Koran. Such feats of memorization are also common among Orthodox religious students and among Hindus who memorize chanted prayers and scriptures. Religion was once the major institution for passing on vital cultural knowledge. We are no longer lonely bands of hunter-gather warriors, so this vast amount of informationis no longer necessary.

2011-03-03,"Broke Town, U.S.A.","Vallejo, a city about 25 miles north of San Francisco, offers a sneak preview of what could be the latest version of economic disaster. When the foreclosure wave hit, local tax revenue evaporated. The city managers couldn’t make their budget and eliminated financing for the local museum, the symphony and the senior center. The city begged the public-employee unions for pay cuts — all to no avail. In May 2008, Vallejo filed for bankruptcy. The filing drew little national attention; most people were too busy watching banks fail to worry about cities. But while the banks have largely recovered, Vallejo is still in bankruptcy. The police force has shrunk from 153 officers to 92. Calls for any but the most serious crimes go unanswered. Residents who complain about prostitutes or vandals are told to fill out a form. Three of the city’s firehouses were closed. Last summer, a fire ravaged a house in one of the city’s better neighborhoods; one of the firetrucks came from another town, 15 miles away.

2011-03-03,Paris Report | Runway as Nightclub at Mugler and Pugh,"Believe it or not, Lady Gaga once had trouble getting any designers to lend her clothes. So much trouble in fact that she had her own knockoff-ish pieces made for the stage. That changed around the time Nicola Formichetti styled her for the September 2009 cover of V Magazine. She quickly owned the must-dress list. And now — as the muse for Formichetti’s new vision for Thierry Mugler — she’s come full circle. Let it be said, Gaga makes for a pretty sick model. Sometimes even the most captivating show can drag on, and rarely does the audience of editors walk out laughing about the good time they just had. Even the models appeared to be having a blast. The clothes — shiny and sexy, with sculptural shoulders sharp enough to be used as weapons — were fun too, and there’s nothing wrong with that.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/paris-report-runway-as-nightclub-at-mugler-and-pugh/

I’m not sure what I expected from the mastermind of a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, but it wasn’t whiny rationalizing like this: “Everyone was greedy. I just went along. It’s not an excuse.” Some crimes are so big that they demand full-throated, active voice, nonhedging remorse. (Not with “we participated” language a la Lloyd Blankfein, either.)  If only Madoff were more like Richard Nixon. True, it took hours of pushing and pressing by David Frost to get Nixon to apologize for Watergate — “I let the American people down, and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life” — and he could have apologized for so much more.

Medieval millenarians expected the world to end in 1000 A.D. These fatal termini would have required supernatural intervention; in the old days humans lacked sufficient means to destroy themselves. The discovery, in 1938, of how to release nuclear energy changed all that. Humankind acquired the means of its own destruction. Even were we to succeed in eliminating our weapons of doomsday — one subject of “How the End Begins” — we would still know how to build them. From our contemporary double millennium forward, the essential challenge confronting our species will remain how to avoid destroying the human world.

Bluntly, the novella is in its Golden Age as a form right now because no one is beating it with a stick until nickels fall out. So my plan for the novella is — drum roll: Do nothing. Or do whatever little is required to steward the status quo. Let’s agree, shall we, to keep throwing around the inane term Great American Novel, and to never, ever utter the phrase Great American Novella. Let’s agree not to remind California what it used to take for granted, that novellas, because of their length, can often be more handily adapted than novels into movies. Let us not remind New York what all the avid and demanding among us take for granted, that a volume of three novellas is more intriguing than one flabby novel. Let us downplay the novella in casual conversation. Writers, if you have a can’t-miss commercially viable yarn a-brewing, be good enough to stretch it into a short novel or compress it into a long story. And look, let’s keep the novella for ourselves, the adults. We deserve something, don’t we? Let’s free the novella of prizes and awards and citations and all manner of gold star. Let’s fail to educate our students about the novella, fail to convince them of its charms. That way, we need never be nostalgic for the Golden Age of the novella. We’ve got something they don’t want, a noncommodity, and we need to look out for it.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/magazine/06block-quote.html

But consolation — emotional if not intellectual or even spiritual — is what Thubron is after as he sets off on a grueling pilgrimage to the most sacred of the world’s mountains, an insurmountable eerie white cone that rises out of a barren plain in Tibet, shielded from easy access by the natural fortress of the Himalayas and the imported vigilance of the Chinese Army. Mount Kailas, the mystic Mount Meru of the Hindu scriptures, is venerated not only by Hindus but by Buddhists, Jains and practitioners of Bon, Tibet’s primeval faith.

He had been a student at the School of American Ballet for several years when in the summer of 1949, heading home through Washington Heights in Manhattan, he found himself in a clash with a local bully, who produced a switchblade. “Without even thinking, I did a grand battement — a big kick — knocking his hand and sending the knife flying,” d’Amboise writes in “I Was a Dancer.” “The force of my kick spun me around on the ball of my foot 360 degrees. I arrived with both feet under me in plié, leaped in the air, and jumped so high my feet kicked down on top of his shoulders, smashing him to the ground.” Then d’Amboise, infected by “the virus of the bully,” pinned down his opponent, “stabbed him in the buttocks, tearing through his jeans, piercing the skin and drawing blood.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/books/review/Macaulay-t.html

2011-03-07,‘Rango’ Is Strong At Weak Box Office,"The weekend box office was sturdy, at least at first glance. “Rango” (Paramount Pictures), left, an animated entry featuring the voice of Johnny Depp, was No. 1 in North America with about $38 million in ticket sales. “The Adjustment Bureau” (Universal Pictures) was second with an estimated $20.9 million, a good result for a difficult-to-market science-fiction thriller cum romance. Even the struggling CBS Films, exhibiting greatly improved marketing, had a decent weekend with its inexpensive “Beastly,” which sold about $10.1 million for third place. So was Hollywood in a glum mood? Moviegoers spent a total of $135 million on tickets over the weekend, a 31 percent decline from the same period a year ago, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. So far this year ticket revenue is down 20 percent on a 22 percent decline in attendance. The problem is that while films have been doing fine, there has been no blockbuster of the kind that can lift interest in moviegoing across the board. (Last year it was “Alice in Wonderland.”) Rounding out the top five were two holdovers; “Hall Pass” (Warner Brothers) sold about $9 million in tickets for a two-week total of $27 million, and “Gnomeo & Juliet” (Walt Disney) sold about $6.9 million for a four-week total of $83.7 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/movies/07arts-RANGOISSTRON_BRF.html

After spending two weeks compiling a list of nominees and fielding readers’ comments about them on the Web site of The San Francisco Chronicle, Mr. Rader has released his final list, with the Latin American poet Pablo Neruda at No. 1. “No poet has more passionately and thoroughly spoken for his people than Neruda,” Mr. Rader wrote, citing “Canto General,” a 15-part book comprising over 200 poems and 15,000 lines tracing the history of Latin America. “It is an insanely ambitious project that seemed to unify a country.” In second place was Shakespeare, whose name, according to Mr. Rader’s “shockingly unscientific measurements,” appeared most frequently in reader e-mails, followed by Dante, who Mr. Rader said was the most controversial pick, because “he’s only well known for one poem (‘The Divine Comedy’).” Western literary greats like Walt Whitman, John Donne, Emily Dickinson, William Butler Yeats and Wallace Stevens also appear on the list with the Eastern favorites Rumi and Li Po, whom Mr. Rader called “the great poet of drunkenness.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/books/07arts-THE10BESTPOE_BRF.html

2011-03-08,Britain’s Excellent Libyan Adventure,"Senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell were out on the Sunday shows to push for more forceful American involvement in Libya. They were joined (with caveats) by an increasingly assertive Senator John Kerry, who insisted that a no-fly zone did not necessitate a military attack per se, contradicting Defense Secretary Gates’s statement on March 2. The question of American policy on intervention in Libya has been murky; Hillary Clinton seemed a bit more hawkish than the president for a while, as did Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Obama has been getting real results on Libya at the United Nations — in the Security Council, at the General Assembly and even in Geneva at the Human Rights Council. But in American politics, successes at the U.N. are not to be spoken of. Americans may have lost their taste for unilateral actions, but they haven’t gained one for multilateral actions either.Then how about some Special Forces sneaking about, as a sop to pride or at least an outlet for the national sense of adventure? Britain’s experience last week suggests caution is in order. A report in The Guardian this morning says a fellow named only Tom, whom the paper believes to be a British intelligence agent, had been working at the Al-Khadra Farm Company — which raises wheat southwest of Benghazi, Libya — for five months, until last Thursday, when he drove off into the desert at 3 a.m. with another foreign national, later returning with “large bags” and six armed Special Air Service men. Guards at the farm arrested them. That must have had a wilting effect on the S.A.S. men’s spirits. But farm personnel gave them a good hot breakfast and packed them off, and by Sunday the little band was safely away to Malta.

We know this because the Heat’s coach, Erik Spoelstra, said so in his postgame comments: “This is painful for every single one of us to go through this, there are a couple of guys crying in the locker room right now, it is not a matter of want.” As you’d imagine, the general reaction hasn’t been one of extending gestures of comfort (for example). And you have to wonder what Spoelstra was thinking when he went all confessional, even if he didn’t name names — didn’t he learn anything from all that grief John Boehner recently had to put up with over his weepiness? As Spoelstra and the Heat are finding out, crying just doesn’t make for good “optics” most of the time.

Imrie quit college to assist Bruce Weber, went on to work on a horse farm in Montauk, N.Y., then movedto Amish country, where he salvaged crumbling barns. He spent a year studying the New Testament (in Greek). Then he biked from Los Angeles, his current home base, to Brazil. At one point, he decided to start Julian Boots, his stylish take on 19th-century footwear (from about $700, at Barneys New York), but first he learned how to make molds in the English Midlands and to tan leather in a 250-year-old Swiss factory. Now he’s an amateur boot historian, able to slip easily into a disquisition on what a 19th-century Cornish miner might wear. What his boots share with their fuss-free forebears, Imrie says, is that ‘‘you can use them in your garden and then rub them off and go to a wedding.’’",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/sole-mate/

2011-03-09,The Rise of the West,"Missouri was always different. Admitted to the Union under the Missouri Compromise, it was the eponymous exception to the agreement, which banned slavery north of the 36″30’ parallel — the line that defined the state’s southern border. And when, in November 1860, the northern free states voted for Abraham Lincoln, most slave states voted for John Breckinridge and three Upper South states voted for John Bell, Missouri was the only state to vote for the Northern Democrat, Stephen Douglas. The results in St. Louis were even more unusual: Lincoln edged out Douglas in a four-way race that — unlike any other that day — mirrored the returns of the country as a whole. St. Louis became the only large city in a slave state won by the president-elect, defying regional stereotypes. And Missouri stayed true to form on March 9, 1861, when its secession convention became the first such meeting to vote for staying in the Union.

2011-03-09,Health at Every Size?,"The start of Lent today will offer many of us yet another opportunity to renew that resolution we made at the start of the year (and abandoned by the time February rolled in), to lose the extra poundage. But before you vow to give up your glasses of Cabernet and your plates of pasta primavera, you might want to consider H.A.E.S., or Health at Every Size, a new “peace movement” that one of its proponents, Linda Bacon, a nutritionist in the Department of Nutrition at the University of California, Davis, says was designed to halt “the collateral damage” — food and body preoccupation, self-hatred and eating disorders — that has resulted from the failed war on obesity. H.A.E.S. is based on the idea that “the best way to improve health is to honor your body,” and it supports the adoption of good health habits simply for the sake of health and well-being rather than weight control.Bacon and Lucy Aphramor, a National Health Service specialist dietitian and an honorary research fellow at the Applied Research Center in Health and Lifestyle Interventions at Coventry University in England, published a paper in Nutrition Journal earlier this year. It argues that a weight-focused approach geared toward losing weight is — surprise! — not especially effective in either reducing the weight or creating healthier bodies. In fact, they say, such an approach can unintentionally lead to weight gain and worse health.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/health-at-every-size/

The auction – the proceeds of which totaled around $1.8 million without the buyer’s premium – also included instruments donated by Mr. Clapton’s musician friends Jeff Beck, J.J. Cale and Joe Bonamassa. Among the top lots was a 1948 Gibson L-5P, which was expected to bring $20,000 to $30,000 but raised $82,960; a 2005 Zemaitis S22BP 3S, estimated at $12,000 to $18,000, which sold for $75,640; and a pair of 1997 Fender Twin Amps, estimated at $9,000 to $12,000, which sold for $42,700.

There’s Jacques Herzog on instinct and architecture; the artist Mike Kelley talking about Detroit, his hometown; and Jack White weighing in on Michelangelo as a modern-day blogger. This week, The Moment features LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy on the sound of snow. But don’t be fooled by the coffee mugs and the California sunshine. Aitken doesn’t do anything casually.

2011-03-11,Lil B | Back to Cali,"Lil B first hit in 2006, at 16, when his group the Pack and its song “Vans” lionized the eponymous skate shoe that had, until then, most definitely not been associated with hip-hop style. (The song was unsponsored, akin to what Run D.M.C. did in the ’80s with their song “My Adidas.”) As a solo artist, the Bay Area rapper has continued against the grain. Last year’s album “Rain in England” melded ambient with rap, perhaps for the first time. A collaborative track with the goth-y Chicago/Michigan trio Salem in late 2010 demonstrated refreshing cross-genre (or subgenre) knowledge. Without being politically correct, Lil B is adept at playing clever word games to undermine some of the negative tropes inherent to hip-hop; his trademark boast — the constantly recycled lyric “I’m a pretty bitch” — uses egotism to unravel misogyny. In three years he has posted enough clips to his YouTube page — more than 240 songs, videos, remixes, video remakes and rambling commentaries — to create something of a canon. Those who explore it tend to grow obsessed. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/lil-b-back-to-cali/

The former New York Giants running back, who quit after the 2006 season, has turned in his unretirement papers. The widespread assumption is that the soon-to-be-36-year-old, whose broadcasting career and marriage have both foundered badly, needs the money. And that’s a mercenary motive that makes some people mad, apparently, and some people sad. (If you’re John Riggins, age 63, it makes you want to throw on the old leather helmet again.) It also prompts one Mike to ask the other Mike on “Mike and Mike in the Morning,” on ESPN Radio, if it’s even possible for a football player like Barber to succeed in coming back if his primary motivation is money and not a raging love for the game. Mike (the former football-playing one) expresses doubt, says it would be hard. A coach in the N.F.L., Raheem Morris, who happens to coach Tiki’s twin brother, Ronde, says you have to have “the heart and the desire and the fire.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/retirement-play-2/

The Swiss architect was in town to discuss a new design for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Maguire and Meyer had invited him out to persuade him to build a house for them. Having long avoided commissions for houses for the rich and famous, Zumthor, now 67, lately concluded that it might be nice to put aside a little nest egg. Besides, he could imagine leaving a mark on a city where plenty of other great architects had worked. So when coffee arrived, he promised to take a look at the property but asked that Maguire and Meyer make a tour of his work in Europe and afterward visit him at his studio in Haldenstein to talk about what they saw.

A mustache, if the underseeded patch of grass beneath his nose could be called that, had sprouted up during the off-season, giving him the aspect of a teenager trying to avoid getting carded.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/little-big-man/

Their folkways were recounted in “Gnomes,” written by the Dutch doctor and children’s author Wil Huygen and illustrated with loving, Norman Rockwell-meets-J. R. R. Tolkien watercolors by Rien Poortvliet. The book sold more than a million copies and spent 56 weeks on the hardcover list before the little creatures crawled back under our collective Pet Rock. Now, an anniversary edition, published on April 1, aims to enlighten a new generation with its accounts of gnome biology (they weigh 300 grams and live an average of 400 years), gnome customs (they greet each other by rubbing noses and maintain friendly relations with rabbits) and gnome sex (which always results in twins, who live at home until age 100).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/books/review/InsideList-t.html

If that question seems too broad (or too harsh), let’s try a more modest one: Why would someone who’s already mastered an art form that is vastly more influential and lucrative than poetry — fiction or songwriting, for example — want to be a poet? The most famous poets aren’t famous, the richest poets aren’t rich, and not even the best-loved poets will ever enjoy the devotion inspired by Barbara Kingsolver, let alone Lady Gaga. So when a superstar from another arena turns his or her attention to poetry, the result can be like watching the Super Bowl M.V.P. forgo an entire season to devote himself to foosball. “Why,” one wonders, “is this person bothering?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/books/review/book-review-i-love-a-broad-margin-to-my-life-by-maxine-hong-kingston.html

Now he has written a book, “The Social Animal,” in order to assemble the evidence for a certain conception of the human mind, the wellsprings of action and the causes of success and failure in life, and to draw implications for social policy. The book is really a moral and social tract, but Brooks has hung it on the life stories of two imaginary people, Harold and Erica, who are used to illustrate his theory in detail and to provide the occasion for countless references to the psychological literature and frequent disquisitions on human nature and society.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/books/review/book-review-the-social-animal-by-david-brooks.html

But there are other pressing matters to be taken care of: a man who has been like a father to him lies dying in McGill’s apartment, McGill’s wife is sleeping with a man half her age and if McGill doesn’t get a paying job he won’t be able to pay the rent on his office.

The studio and salon both evolved, Rhodes-Pitts explains, out of Gumby’s singular passion for scrapbooking — his “impulse to compile, collect and curate the detritus of his reality.” Gumby’s efforts ultimately produced an apartment’s worth of materials about the so-called black experience, culminating, we are told, in a “brilliant and strange production.” These words well describe Rhodes-Pitts own achievement in “Harlem Is Nowhere.” Her happily disparate text blends the historical and the personal, the exceptional and the ordinary, adroitly communicating the multiplicity of Harlem itself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/books/review/book-review-harlem-is-nowhere-by-sharifa-rhodes-pitts.html

Dawkins of Alexandria Circuit Court on behalf of her children. He ordered her feeding tube reinstated while the legal issues were weighed.

Other winners included Roger Allam for best actor, in “Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2” at Shakespeare’s Globe, and the actress Nancy Carroll for her turn in the World War II drama “After the Dance,” which won for best revival.

What happened? Unappealing alien characters, a tepid marketing campaign, family film gridlock at theaters and the movie’s antifeminist undertones contributed. But Hollywood will read this Walt Disney Studios flop as a rejection of Robert Zemeckis’s style of “performance-capture” animated filmmaking. (Mr. Zemeckis produced “Mars Needs Moms.”) Meanwhile a well-executed marketing push by Sony Pictures Entertainment catapulted “Battle: Los Angeles” to a stronger-than-expected No. 1 position over the weekend. This alien invasion movie had about $36 million in sales, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing data. The animated “Rango” (Paramount Pictures) held up in its second weekend, taking in about $23 million for a new total of $68.7 million and second place. “Red Riding Hood” (Warner Brothers) failed to tap into the “Twilight” fantasy fan base, selling a soft $14 million in third place. “The Adjustment Bureau,” a drama from Universal Pictures, was fourth in its second weekend, selling about $11.5 million for a new total of $38.5 million. “Mars Needs Moms” (a scene from the film, right) was fifth.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/movies/mars-needs-moms-and-paying-customers.html

At the beginning of the show, Mr. Muti criticized the government for cutting Italy’s arts budget. When the crowd cheered for more after the chorus’s rendition of “Va’ pensiero,” Mr. Muti said he would allow an encore if the audience sang along in support of culture and patriotism. Less than five weeks after having heart surgery, and against the advice of his doctors, Mr. Muti was back at the podium on Saturday for the first of several performances of “Nabucco” planned for this month as part of Italy’s celebration of 150 years of national unity. “I don’t want, today, in 2011, that ‘Nabucco’ becomes a funeral hymn to culture and music,” Mr. Muti said before starting. He appeared energetic during the performance, according to The A.P., despite having had a pacemaker installed recently. In February, Mr. Muti fell from the podium during a rehearsal with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, of which he is the music director. He had what his doctor called “a common heart rhythm disturbance.” He is scheduled to conduct a concert performance of “Otello” in April at Carnegie Hall.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/arts/music/muti-leads-encore-in-rome.html

The May premiere was intended to be a preview of the show, but the special effects will not be ready in time, Fox’s president of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, said in a statement. The visual effects are “essential,” he said, “so we are pushing back the special early preview date to give the visual effects team the time needed for their groundbreaking work.” The “Terra Nova” story starts in 2149, when Earth is dying and scientists must find a way to send a family back to a prehistoric, dinosaur-era version of the planet. In the place of “Terra Nova” on May 23 and 24, Fox will show the season finales of “The Chicago Code” and “Glee.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/arts/television/technical-issues-delay-foxs-terra-nova.html

The novel, by Hans Fallada, is based on the true story of Otto and Elise Hampel, who wrote anti-Hitler slogans on postcards and dropped them in public buildings. They were eventually arrested and executed. Fallada wrote the book soon after the war ended, when he was given the Hampels’ Gestapo file. The book was written quickly and had a quiet release in Germany in 1947, just after Fallada’s death. But it was not widely read until 2009, after its release in the United States and Britain. Aufbau publishing house in Berlin recently uncovered the unabridged manuscript and will publish a new edition, which is to include a deleted chapter depicting the Quangels, as the couple is called in the novel, as fans of Hitler until they learn of their son’s death on the German front.

2011-03-14,Effects Coordinator Cleared in Death of ‘Dark Knight’ Cameraman,"A British jury said on Monday that an Academy Award-winning special effects coordinator was not responsible for the death of a cameraman who was killed in a stunt mishap during the filming of “The Dark Knight,” Reuters reported. After less than two hours of deliberation, jurors at Crown Court in Guildford, southwest of London, ruled unanimously that the effects coordinator, Christopher Corbould, was not guilty of failing to ensure the safety of the cameraman, Conway Wickliffe. Mr. Wickliffe was killed in 2007 on the set of “The Dark Knight,” Christopher Nolan‘s sequel to his superhero film “Batman Begins,” as he rode in a pickup truck driving parallel to a stunt car; the pickup missed a 90-degree turn and crashed into a tree. Last week, prosecutors argued that Mr. Corbould, who won an Oscar for his work on “Inception” and whose filmography includes several “James Bond” movies, did not follow proper safety guidelines in planning the stunt and that the accident was foreseeable. Mr. Wickliffe was honored in the closing credits of “The Dark Knight,” along with the actor Heath Ledger, who died before the film’s release.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/effects-coordinator-cleared-in-death-of-dark-knight-cameraman/

Mr. Dylan, whose songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Masters of War” were sung at many a Vietnam War-era protest, is scheduled to perform a set list of his own determining on April 10 at RMIT University in Ho Chi Minh City. Rod Quinton, the general manager of Saigon Sound System, a Ho Chi Minh City company that is promoting the concert, told The A.P. that Mr. Dylan “is a very important legend of music, and we think it’s important that Vietnamese people, particularly the younger generation, are exposed to his legacy and what he’s done for music.” The director of Art Performances Department of the Vietnamese government said Mr. Dylan had been granted permission to give the concert, which will come days after his first performances in China, in Beijing on April 6 and in Shanghai on April 8. The A.P. said tickets for Mr. Dylan’s Ho Chi Minh City performance would run from about $43 — just more than Vietnam’s monthly minimum wage — to about $120 for V.I.P. seats.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/modern-times-indeed-dylan-plans-first-concert-in-vietnam/

The circumstances of his death quickly became known to his family and were recounted correctly in Meyer Berger’s 1951 history, “The Story of The New York Times: 1851-1951,” and in a 1975 article in The Times by Martin Arnold reporting on the discovery of Mr. Darnton’s last notebook, the one in which he was writing when he died.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/all-the-news-after-64-years-the-story-that-didnt-fly/

The two of them go to a spa nearby where they work out and often get a massage before settling into the daily routine of caring for a 2-year-old daughter, Milan, and a newborn son, Morocco; they also run Tyrannic, a production company they own.

The film, written and directed by Robbie Pickering, is a comedy about a woman who gets to know the eldest son of her husband, who has been a regular donor at a sperm bank. The grand jury prize for a documentary went to the director Tristan Patterson’s “Dragonslayer,” about the life and love of a youth in Fullerton, a Southern California suburb. “Natural Selection” also received prizes for performances by Rachael Harris and Matt O’Leary, and for its script, editing and score, setting it up as the big winner at a festival that focused heavily on low-budget films with small, personal stories. On Wednesday, by contrast, Jodie Foster was set to appear with “The Beaver,” from Summit Entertainment. That film, which she directed and in which she performs, stars Mel Gibson as a troubled toy executive who sorts out his life with the help of a beaver hand puppet. Mr. Gibson, who pleaded no contest on Friday to a misdemeanor count of battering his ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, is not expected to attend the film’s Wednesday-night premiere.

And some of the animated shorts feature the voices of David Duchovny, Joseph Fiennes and Ian McKellen. The films were chosen out of 2,862 submissions; they represent 20 countries and include 22 world premieres. Documentary subjects include a Haitian community that joins together to build a movie theater, a rock musician who decides to have transgender surgery, and a motivational speaker privately battling bipolar disorder. The narrative films include one in which a character tries to atone for a car accident that left a girl in a vegetative state; one about a man seeking justice after he thinks his son has been sexually assaulted; and — for those in search of lighter fare — a film titled “Mr. Stache” and described as “the awesome adventures of a man and his mustache.” The short films will compete for three awards — Best Narrative Short, Best Documentary Short and the Student Visionary Award — with combined cash and value-in-kind prizes totaling more than $15,000. The winner of Best Narrative Short will qualify for consideration in the short-film category of the Academy Awards without the standard theatrical run.

2011-03-16,Get Real and Get a Mandoline,"A mandoline seems to be one of the last frontiers for the home cook. Maybe it seems too fussy with all those different blades, or maybe people are under the impression that you have to buy the most expensive model, which can get extremely pricey. But even the cheapest mandoline will make your life so much easier in the kitchen. For example, while I could, with much time and a little effort, thinly slice the potatoes for a gratin (such as in my column on Wednesday), running them through a mandoline takes about three minutes and gives me perfectly even, gossamer slices, which melt into the cream while baking in the oven. I also rely on my mandoline for paper-thin slices of fennel and zucchini for salads, and lovely wafers of beets that I serve carpaccio-style with a walnut-mustard dressing on top. And then there’s my recipe for French apple tart, which depends on uniform slices of apple that are a breeze with a mandoline. So here are a few tips for those of you ready to take the plunge. Mandolines range in price based on the sharpness of the blade, the number of different cuts the blades will make and the sturdiness of the base.  I have used the Super Benriner (about $50), but years ago, I had the most basic Benriner ($20) and it served me just fine until the blades grew dull.  If you just want something basic, go for a cheaper model – they start somewhere around $15 (Norpro and Kyocera, for example, make them). And if you want something a bit more substantial (able to handle a more diverse range of fruits and vegetables), go for a sturdier, more advanced model. Oxo and Swissmar Borner (both about $40) are two reliable brands in this price range. And if you are looking to invest in something that will last you a lifetime and give you the widest variety of blades for different cuts, stainless steel professional models go for around $100, but you probably won’t ever have to replace them. Mandolines from MIU sell for about $110; Bron has one for $150 and De Buyer’s model, $229, allows for left-handed users. Most of the mandolines are compact and collapsible, which is particularly useful if you’re in a tiny kitchen and space is at a premium. And if you’re worried about cuts and scrapes, consider this glove, which has saved my knuckles from many an injury.",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/get-real-and-get-a-mandoline-draft-2/

The play, “Imagining Madoff” by Deborah Margolin, originally depicted a close relationship between Mr. Madoff and Mr. Wiesel, who in real life lost all his and his wife’s savings and $15.2 million of his charitable foundation’s assets in Mr. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Before the play’s premiere at Theater J in Washington, Ms. Margolin sent Mr. Wiesel a copy of the script, hoping he would like it. Instead, he threatened to have his lawyer halt the production. Ms. Margolin agreed to revise the play, but when Theater J’s artistic director, Ari Roth, volunteered to show the revised script to Mr. Wiesel’s foundation, she decided to back out of the production entirely. Instead, she took the rewritten version — with Mr. Wiesel’s character replaced by a fictional Holocaust survivor and poet named Solomon Galkin — to Stageworks/Hudson, a small theater company in upstate New York, where it was performed last summer. Mr. Roth saw the play there and subsequently renewed a discussion with Ms. Margolin about producing it at Theater J. The play will open on Aug. 31 and run through Sept. 25.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/fresh-life-for-madoff-play-in-washington/

It was the din of live music and recordings, of come-ons and conversations, of pitches and pickup lines, of excited giggles and male banter, of tentative connections and of fortuitous reunions and, as the day goes on, of drunken bonhomie or befuddlement, of strategies being worked and of pure chaotic happenstance. It’s the din of business meeting pleasure, which is what has now sustained SXSW into its 25th year.

2011-03-17,Seeing Things | Handmade for Japan,"It has been almost one week since the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. If, like me, you love design, you probably have a favorite Japanese designer in fashion, architecture, graphic design or ceramics. Japan is a country that has always nurtured design, from handcraft to industrially produced goods; as a result, good design has become synonymous with Japanese design. Many of the country’s designers have been affected by the disaster, which continues to unfold in ways that are unfathomable to most of us. In Kasama and Mashiko, centers of ceramic production that are about halfway between Tokyo and Sendai, potters were hard hit by the quake when brick kilns collapsed and years’ worth of production shattered in minutes. Moved by the desire to support their fellow artists, three enterprising women in the United States have organized Handmade for Japan, an online auction of handmade work donated by Japanese artists and American artists with ties to Japan. Ayumi Horie, a Japanese-American potter who lives in Hudson, N.Y., recruited her friends Kathryn Pombriant Manzella and Ai Kanazawa Cheung to solicit donations and set up the auction, while the illustrator David Gordon designed a logo overnight. Offers of support, in-kind donations and handmade goods have poured in via Twitter, Facebook and e-mail. And artists including the illustrator Lisa Congdon, the textile designer Kaoru Oka and the ceramists Jun Kaneko, Justin Rothshank, Kathy Erteman and Diana Fayt, to name a few, have contributed paintings, shawls and, of course, pottery. The auction will go live on eBay on March 24 and will run through March 27. Through GlobalGiving, 100 percent of the auction proceeds will support relief efforts in Japan.

The Malaysian broadcaster AMP Radio Networks told The A.P. that those lyrics “may be considered as offensive when viewed against Malaysia’s social and religious observances,” adding that being gay or bisexual is “still considered as a ‘taboo’ by general Malaysians.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/lady-gaga-gets-garbled-on-malaysian-radio/

On Wednesday, Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities released an illustrated list of 54 objects missing from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which was looted on Jan. 28.

What could you possibly give the King in return as a key anniversary in his career approaches? Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages that rock legend’s licensing, publishing and merchandising, is hoping it can entice you to create some Elvis-oriented art, in return for a shot at a Presley-themed prize package. To mark the 55 years since 1956, the fateful year when Presley released his single “Heartbreak Hotel,” his album “Elvis Presley” and his movie “Love Me Tender,” the company said in a news release that it is seeking a “a work of art that symbolizes Elvis’ revolution in 1956.” Entries can be provided in just about any medium (which would seem to include velvet paintings) and must be submitted in .jpeg or .pdf format at Elvis.com/revolution by April 28. The finalists will be chosen by a panel of judges, and the artist whose work received the most “likes” on Facebook (how very 1956!) will receive a prize package that includes a trip to Memphis, Tenn., during Elvis Week 2011; tickets to Cirque du Soleil‘s “Viva Elvis” show in Las Vegas; and a cabin on the 2012 Elvis Cruise (does it go to “Blue Hawaii”?).

2011-03-18,Coast Garde,"The seaside town of Margate, England, a thriving summer playground until its decline in the 1970s, is counting on the Turner Contemporary to revive its fortunes. Opening April 16, this striking museum — designed by David Chipperfield and named for the painter J. M. W. Turner, one of Margate’s famous visitors — has already spurred new galleries, pubs and cafes, as well as the restoration of Dreamland, a 1920s amusement park down the road. And it has inspired a lyrical new work by Tracey Emin, who grew up in Margate. Her pink neon sculpture “I Never Stopped Loving You” hangs adjacent to the museum. (Hundreds of people showed up to cheer its installation last year.) “There is more of an appetite for contemporary art here than you might imagine,” says Victoria Pomery, the Turner’s founding director. The inaugural show presents six artists whose works relate to a little-known Turner canvas depicting the Soufrière volcano on St. Vincent. “We want to help audiences get a better sense of the contemporary through the historical,” Pomery says. “And we will always have a Turner presence.” Adds Emin, “The other nice thing about the Turner is that it will have a really beautiful cafe, so people like my 82-year-old mum can go and look out at the sea and have a nice cup of tea.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/coast-garde/

Even before the book was reviewed on our cover a couple of weeks ago, keen readers may have been familiar with Obreht as the youngest member of The New Yorker’s “20 Under 40” coterie of fiction writers, announced last June when she was 24. (Other “20 Under 40” writers to make our best-seller lists include Joshua Ferris, Jonathan Safran Foer, Karen Russell and Gary Shteyngart.) Not that Obreht was unacquainted with best sellers before. In 2009, she wrote a post for The New Yorker’s blog The Book Bench in which she talked about her plans to read “Lolita” on a holiday flight to Russia. Distracted, she picked up her seatmate’s “Da Vinci Code” instead. “I doubt he cares that my copy of ‘Lolita’ wound up with him,” she wrote, “or that I finished ‘The Da Vinci Code’ three days later on a deckchair on our porch.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/books/review/insidelist-t.html

2011-03-18,A Thriller Revisits the Cambridge Spies,"The five spies from Trinity College, Cambridge, may have betrayed their country during the cold war, but they performed an indisputable service for British literature. A number of works have either been inspired or enlivened by the misdeeds of Kim Philby, John Cairncross, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt. In Anthony Powell’s panoramic “Dance to the Music of Time,” for example, Lord Widmerpool gets into political hot water for what his wife derisively calls “his little under-the-counter Communist games.” Then there is the Irish writer John Banville’s elegant roman à clef, “The Untouchable,” which explored Blunt’s life. And novelists of such varying stripes as Ian Fleming and John le Carré have drawn sustenance from the treachery that emanated from 1930s Cambridge, where enlistment in the worker’s revolution seems to have easily accompanied sipping claret, participating in debauches and collecting Poussin paintings. After Burgess and Maclean, and later Philby, fled to Moscow, the K.G.B. must have sometimes wondered whether the information they supplied was worth the sheer bother of having to put up with these spoiled brats.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/books/review/book-review-the-trinity-six-by-charles-cumming.html

We know what it is, but we don’t know why it exerts such a powerful hold on the imagination, or how it works its magic. There’s a perfect madness in the desire to study moonlight, to wander across the world under its spell, to seek out the ways in which it alters reality, inspires art or otherwise leaves its mark on the soul. But that’s just the sort of intellectual wanderlust that seized James Attlee one evening during a walk on the coast of Cornwall as he watched “the rim of the harvest moon emerging from the sea, a monstrous, swollen apparition.” Struck by this spectacular sight, Attlee was also struck by the realization that our lives are no longer held, as they were “for countless millennia,” in the sway of the night sky. “Nocturne: A Journey in Search of Moonlight” is his eccentric, rambling, charming report “from this abandoned field,” a book by turns erratic and spellbinding.

Her darkly moralistic version of la vie bohème takes place in the 1950s and ’60s, not on scruffy Avenue B — where downtown artists tended to pride themselves on scraping along and being rejected by the Establishment — but on the fiercely status-conscious Upper East Side, only a short walk from Elaine’s. It is perfectly true, however, that both uptown and downtown, writers drank, womanized and had misogynistic attitudes. (Of course, so did the rest of America, which was running on alcohol after the war and was on the uneasy verge of a sexual revolution.)

2011-03-18,Seeing Red (and White),"For six days only — March 25-30 — what promises to be an extraordinary exhibition will fill the Wade Thompson Drill Hall at the Park Avenue Armory. “Infinite Variety: Three Centuries of Red and White Quilts,” which was organized by the American Folk Art Museum, will present 650 red and white quilts — no two of which are alike — from the collection of Joanna S. Rose (who will donate 50 of them to the museum when the exhibition ends). The largest quilt exhibition ever mounted under one roof in New York City, it will fill the 55,000- square-foot drill hall to a height of 45 feet with a series of “rooms” defined by quilts that will be suspended on cardboard tubes. In the center of the installation, which was designed by the New York firm Thinc Design, a group of quilts will hang in a spiral formation that the designers liken to a tornado, above a circle of chairs that alludes to the social — and female-dominated — nature of quilting. Organized by Elizabeth V. Warren, a guest curator who is also a trustee of the museum, and Stacy C. Hollander, a senior curator at the museum, the exhibition will be free to the public and will include a cafe and shop. Even if you won’t be able to buy the quilts, the postcards should be terrific.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/seeing-red-and-white/

The backdrop is the distress I’ve felt in the last few months as it has become apparent that in budget battles the tendency is to throw the weakest and most vulnerable sectors (i.e. children) overboard. In contrast, Japan seems to me to offer an example where stress knits a country more tightly together and where there has been a certain tendency for people to look after each other.

But these early relationships are worth probing, for they show that The Times and Lincoln were helpful to each other on their way up, and that newspapers were anything but gray ladies as the conflict drew closer. It also shows that their symbiotic relationship was seriously strained in the weeks between the inaugural on March 4 and the outbreak of war on April 12.

According to a report on the blog galleycat.com, the publishing group Round Table Companies, in partnership with Smarter Comics, will release a series of comic book adaptations of best-selling nonfiction titles. “The Art of War”; “The Long Tail,” by Chris Anderson; “From the Barrio to the Boardroom,” by Robert Renteria; and “How to Master the Art of Selling,” by Tom Hopkins, will be among the titles released in print on April 16 and as a free download online from April 1 through July 1. In an e-mail Corey Michael Blake, the chief executive of Round Table, said that he hoped to attract the interest of busy professionals, Twitter-generation readers who prefer to be entertained as they are educated, and traditional comic book readers. “I’ve been combining business and entertainment for years,” Mr. Blake wrote. “Seeing it working over and over, this was a gut play.

Riders are divided in their response to the single-minded intensity of Alice Tan Ridley, whose many renditions of “I Will Survive” are almost too authentic. Ridley, by the way, is Gabourey Sidibe’s mother (Sidibe played Precious in the movie of the same name a couple of years ago), and when the conversation turns to subway music, she is the first person many locals mention, rarely by name, almost always as “the woman who sings ‘I Will Survive’ for hours on end.” Ridley taught special ed before she hit the platforms, and after reaching the semifinals of “America’s Got Talent” last year, she has become perhaps our best-known subway performer.

Rock crystals and diamonds are organically incorporated into the designs, using techniques employed by the Mughal Empire of Jaipur, India. “Gold embraces a gemstone and assumes its form,” says von Furstenberg of eye-catching pieces like the undulating teardrop crystal rings. “The movement within the gold alludes to sensuality and natural feminine forms.” Inspirational inscriptions, like love, laughter, harmony and freedom, are engraved on the back of each pendant, earring droplet and ring, a tribute to the power von Furstenberg sees in both words and gold. (Prices range from $3,200 to $8,200). “The combination not only adds beauty, but strength and empowerment as well,” she explains. Indeed, the collection displays a majestic embodiment of the literal translation of “sutra” from Sanskrit: a line that holds objects together.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/sutras-stones-dvf-and-h-stern/

2011-03-22,War Without Illusions,"Judging from my inbox, many readers interpreted this week’s column, which examines the perils inherent in the liberal interventionist style of warfare, as an implicit defense of the Bush administration’s rather different approach to the invasion of Iraq. (There were hints of a similar critique from Adam Serwer and Andrew Sullivan as well.) This was not my intention at all: As I’ve suggested before, I think that the Iraq War was a mistake in its conception and a botch in its execution, and I wouldn’t be supportive of our Libya intervention if it were being undertaken à la Rumsfeld (or John Bolton) rather than à la Samantha Power. My point, rather, was to push back against the conceit that the form of a war can vindicate its strategy — that what matters most in warfare is whether you’re “part of U.N. Security Council approved action” and whether the Arab League gives you the go-ahead, and that merely invoking the Obama White House’s multilateralism is sufficient to prove that our Libyan venture is far more responsible than the invasion of Iraq. Too many liberal Libya hawks (the president included) seem bent on persuading themselves that a strategically dubious intervention is justified so long as its goals are sufficiently high-minded and the French and the United Nations are on board. But the history of such interventions doesn’t bear their logic out.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/war-without-illusions/

In the interview, Ms. Roberts asked Mr. Brown about a 2009 incident involving his ex-companion, the pop singer Rihanna, after which Mr. Brown pleaded guilty to a charge of felonious assault and was sentenced to five years of probation and six months of community labor. After Mr. Brown said that a restraining order against him had recently been relaxed, Ms. Roberts asked if he and Rihanna still saw each other; Mr. Brown replied, “I mean, not really,” and he avoided follow-up questions. Mr. Brown then performed a song from his new album and returned to his dressing room, where the “G.M.A.” morning staff members said they heard loud noises that prompted a call to security, according to a report on the ABC News Web site. It was later found that a window in the dressing room had been broken, leaving glass in the room and on the street outside ABC’s studio in Times Square, and that Mr. Brown and his representatives had left the building.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/an-uneasy-return-for-chris-brown-on-good-morning-america/

2011-03-23,High on the Hog | Miru Kim’s ‘The Pig That Therefore I Am’,"At first glance, the photographs in Miru Kim’s new show, “The Pig That Therefore I Am,” opening this Thursday at the Doosan Gallery in New York, seem like abstract studies of female skin. But as your eye moves to take in the big picture, you are surprised and perhaps a bit horrified to discover that most of the flesh in these intimate compositions is not human. A nude female (the 30-year-old artist herself) lies in filth with hundreds of caged hogs in industrial farms. The impulse is to recoil in disgust, but you are easily drawn back by the stillness, the almost transcendental quality of the images.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/high-on-the-hog-miru-kims-the-pig-that-therefore-i-am/

2011-03-23,Super-Frog,"There’s this story in Haruki Murakami’s “after the quake” (according to Jay Rubin, the book’s translator, Murakami insisted that the title be lowercase) called “Super-Frog Saves Tokyo.” The book is a collection of short stories about the psychic aftershocks of the ’95 Kobe earthquake. (Here’s a fascinating conversation between Murakami and Jonathan Lethem, plus audio of Murakami reading “Super-Frog.”) Five of the six stories are more or less straight-up realism, but “Super-Frog” is from the land of Kafka. A slightly overwhelmed and depressive banker named Katagiri comes home one day to find a huge Dostoyevsky-quoting frog in his house. The frog tells Katagiri that he needs his help defeating the monstrous Worm that’s raging beneath the streets of Tokyo. (Worm, by the way, is a version of the catfish of Japanese mythology, which my colleague Harvey Dickson wrote about.)",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/super-frog/

No doubt he has the right to do so, but does that mean he’s right to do so? Is it a smart business decision? You’d think that such vigorous policing of a brand’s use in a case like this would threaten to make the brand less appealing to the fans who make that brand valuable in the first place.

The seven styles — made from 50 collections’ worth of unused tweed, wool, corduroy and printed cotton scrap fabric — are at once graphically modern and sentimentally nostalgic. “My mother made me a log cabin quilt from leftover fabric that we were given while I was working at Kenzo,” says the A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou. “So, the idea came quite naturally.” And while quilts are very of the moment — think Rodarte’s prairie-inspired collection for fall 2011 — according to Touitou, these are pieces that are designed to last. “What’s important is passing on culture, it’s like blues or cooking,” he says. “Perhaps it will fix some memories for people.

2011-03-24,HBO Votes for Ed Harris to Play John McCain,"Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, made a pretty convincing Senator John McCain when he appeared as himself in “Wedding Crashers” and on “Saturday Night Live,” but HBO Films has decided to go a different route in casting for its coming television-movie “Game Change.” On Wednesday evening HBO said that it had chosen Ed Harris, the Academy Award-nominated star of “Apollo 13,” “Pollock,” “The Truman Show” and “The Hours,” to play Mr. McCain in the film, which is adapted from the book of the same title by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. The film will chronicle Mr. McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign starting with his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate. HBO previously announced that Julianne Moore (of “The Kids Are All Right”) would play Ms. Palin in the film, which will be directed by Jay Roach (“Dinner for Schmucks”) and written by Danny Strong. Mr. Roach and Mr. Strong previously collaborated on the HBO movie “Recount,” about the backroom battles that followed the 2000 presidential election.

People were talking about Elizabeth Taylor, Carine Roitfeld’s appointment as a guest editor/stylist for Barneys and places they had recently been (other than fashion shows), and eyeing a Maje blazer with satin lapels, as if to say, “Should I or shouldn’t I?” Ms. Traina, whose sisters Victoria and Samantha also attended, had on a blazer and skinny pants, with a cutaway Balenciaga top that draped in the front.

2011-03-24,The Replacements Approach to the Replacements,"“Color Me Obsessed” is just about the perfect title for a new documentary about the Replacements. The movie’s tag line is also promising: “The potentially true story of the last best band.” And yet I was a little surprised to learn that the Replacements themselves are not really in the film. Instead, the movie is a parade of 40-something (and older) ex-rockers and critics reminiscing ecstatically about the glory days. (Those would be the years 1981 to 1987.) A colleague (and huge ’Mats fan) objected, “If I want to hear a bunch of guys talk about how great the Replacements were, I’ll go hang out in a record store!” He paused as the realization sunk in: there are no more record stores. “Color Me Obsessed” will have to do.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/the-replacements-approach-to-the-replacements/

2011-03-24,36 Hours in Seattle,"SPRING comes early to Seattle and lasts long. By the end of February, the rains relent and pastel shades of plum and narcissus initiate a progression of color and scent that lasts months. But new flora is not the only thing popping out of the ground in Seattle these days. Seemingly overnight, whole swatches of downtown and close-in neighborhoods — notably South Lake Union and the Pike-Pine Corridor — have transformed themselves into vibrant enclaves of restaurants, bars and galleries. With so many converted and repurposed buildings, Seattle’s cityscape is starting to look as layered as the wardrobes of its inhabitants. The tarry pitch of the timber port never disappeared; it just got plastered over with grunge flannel, tech money, yuppie coffee, Pacific Rim flavors, and more recently the backyard chickens and chard of urban pioneers. Don’t let a passing shower keep you from entering the mix.

Mr. Ozon, a prolific filmmaker, has also, perhaps intentionally, approximated the stodgy good cheer that often distinguishes lavish, star-studded stage revivals of beloved old chestnuts.

2011-03-25,Wisconsin: No Ruling on Union Law,"The battle over a state law curbing the union rights of public workers is headed for the State Supreme Court after a lower court declined to weigh in on the issue. The lower court, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, said the issues involved were so fundamental — involving a clash between the state’s open meetings law and the separation of legislative and judicial powers — that it made sense to send the case straight to state’s highest court. Last Friday, a judge in Dane County blocked the law while she considered a lawsuit that accuses Republican lawmakers of violating open meetings laws by failing to give adequate notice of the vote on the union law. The state had asked the appeals court to throw out that order. Also Thursday, an Indiana prosecutor said one of his deputies had resigned after admitting that he sent an e-mail to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin suggesting that Mr. Walker fake an attack on himself to discredit the unions. The prosecutor, Brad Cooper of Johnson County, said the deputy, Carlos Lam, acknowledged that he sent an e-mail, which was obtained by The Associated Press. It said: “If you could employ an associate who pretends to be sympathetic to the unions’ cause to physically attack you (or even use a firearm against you), you could discredit the public unions.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/us/25brfs-NORULINGONUN_BRF.html

But still. As one of our contributing writers, Jon Gertner, put it a few years ago, “Nuclear power plants are arguably the most complicated machines in the history of civilization.” Even as that partly hints at why their failures can be so catastrophic, it also prompts the question: Shouldn’t we have more than upgrades by now?

Stern’s N.B.A., which just had one of its least successful franchises (the Warriors) sell for a record $450 million, wants player salaries slashed by 38 percent. Goodell’s N.F.L., which has never been more profitable, wants 18 percent.

A screening at MoMA of “Hit So Hard,” directed by P. David Ebersole, is set to be visited by its subject, Ms. Schemel, as well as the guitarist Eric Erlandson and the bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, not to mention a certain idiosyncratic front woman and fashion plate named Courtney Love. If we sound a little surprised by the gathering (which the film series organizers say is the first time these four musicians have been together at a public event in 13 years), consider such past events in the history of Hole as: Ms. Schemel’s departure from the group in 1998 and the band’s dissolution in 2002; Ms. Love’s announcement of a Hole reunion in 2009 that seemed to surprise Ms. Auf der Mar; Mr. Erlandson’s remarks that “there is no Hole without me” and Ms. Love’s online reply that Hole is “MY Band” and “MY name.” A Q. and A. with Mr. Ebersole and the band members is set to follow the screening; there was no mention of whether it would be conducted from within a steel cage.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/relive-through-this-a-hole-reunion-of-sorts-at-new-directorsnew-films/

2011-03-25,African Tyrant,"Peter Godwin has carved out a niche as a skillful chronicler of politics and war in his native Zimbabwe. His 1996 memoir, “Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa,” was an affecting account of his coming-of-age in white-minority-ruled Rhodesia, where his father managed a factory and his mother, a physician, operated a rural health clinic. The story climaxed with the outbreak of the civil war that would bring the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe to power — and with the accidental killing of Godwin’s elder sister by Rhodesian troops at a roadblock. “When a Crocodile Eats the Sun: A Memoir of Africa,” published in 2007, picked up the narrative with Mugabe’s evolution into a brutal dictator who stomped on the opposition, evicted thousands of white farmers in a violent land reform program and plunged his country into ruin. Now Godwin has written the third installment of what might be called his Zimbabwe trilogy. In “The Fear: Robert Mugabe and the Martyrdom of Zimbabwe,” he documents the 2008 presidential election and its aftermath, when Mugabe unleashed ruling-party militias in a savage campaign to keep his hold on power.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/books/review/book-review-the-fear-robert-mugabe-and-the-martyrdom-of-zimbabwe-by-peter-godwin.html

Named for the singular “dodging” skills of pedestrians in a borough crammed with trolley lines, the Dodgers hadn’t captured a pennant since 1920, and had never won a World Series. “Brooklyn?” roared Bill Terry, manager of the hated New York Giants. “Is Brooklyn still in the league?” Dodger fans were largely immune to this abuse. Their addiction had taught them patience and humility — like belonging to a religion whose one flaw was an unreachable promised land.

For Heathcock, suffering is everyone’s fate, a point he drives home repeatedly. When a teenager in one story helps burn the body of a man his father has killed in a senseless fight, he thinks of “all the fires the world has ever seen, fires from wars, fires from bombs,” and concludes that the lingering remains of all that smoke is “now just the air we breathe.” In other words, sorrow and strife are permanent parts of the human condition.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/books/review/book-review-volt-stories-by-alan-heathcock.html

Singing in a piquant tone with a thick vibrato, she poured out tales of working-class lives and endurance pushed to the brink, usually by love. Face, hands and voice were all she needed to bring her playlets to life. One of her trademarks, “L’Accordéoniste,” was written for her in 1940. As she sang of a prostitute whose musician lover went off to war and never returned, Piaf rocked her arms through the air manically to the rhythm of his playing; she caressed her stomach as though remembering how he felt against her.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/books/review/book-review-no-regrets-the-life-of-edith-piaf-by-carolyn-burke.html

One could begin with the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, by which the United States reserved the right to intervene militarily in the region, and then look just about anywhere down through the years for examples of shameful behavior. In “Red Heat,” Alex von Tunzelmann concentrates on just one area, the Caribbean, and mainly on one decade, the 1960s. In those years, the United States promoted political assassinations, turned a blind eye to horrific brutality and repression by local tyrants, sponsored an invasion of Cuba and dispatched 23,000 soldiers and Marines to the Dominican Republic in order to prevent the establishment of a government there it feared would be unfriendly.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/books/review/book-review-red-heat-by-alex-von-tunzelmann.html

Five years later, he bought a house near the sea and acquired a dog, indicating some improvement in his mental health.

The missives date from 1845 to 1848, a year before Chopin’s death, and were written from Paris and Nohant in central France — the childhood home of George Sand, Chopin’s lover — to the composer’s family in Warsaw. It was a time of considerable turmoil in the Chopin-Sand domestic arrangement. The letters were in the hands of Laura Ciechomska, a grandniece of Chopin, until at least 1939, a museum curator, Alicja Knast, said, according to The Associated Press. They resurfaced in 2003, and the museum later acquired them, The Associated Press said. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/frederic-chopin-letters-on-display-in-warsaw/

They tell stories about their lives that emphasize resilience and bouncing back. What’s more, they relied on strong social support networks to get through their injuries.

The writer Wells Tower also takes a timely journey, this one through Humboldt County, the cannabis-growing hub of California (much in the news recently) with a lovably cantankerous local culture and an impossibly gorgeous landscape. Nature is also the lure in Newfoundland, Canada, which, as Mark Schatzker learns, is perhaps the best place to catch and eat a wild Atlantic salmon, a fish most of us have only eaten farmed. Elsewhere in the issue are more cerebral pleasures, as in Trieste, a legendary Italian redoubt for thinkers and flâneurs, and Beirut, Lebanon, where Joumana Haddad is creating a stir with her erotic writing — as well as plenty of sybaritic pursuits: a luxurious new boot-camp spa in Laguna, Calif.; a revived, post-recession London filled with new restaurants, shops and bars; and a lively music scene revolves around the beer halls and nightclubs of Hamburg, Germany, a playground forever enshrined by the Beatles.

With its crisp narrative — a soldier sells his violin (and thus his soul) to the Devil, fights to win it back, but ultimately loses it again — its dance-rich, jazz-influenced melodies; and its dramatic text, “Soldat” (“The Soldier’s Tale”) offers abundant collaborative possibilities.

2011-03-28,A New Script for ‘Spider-Man’: Goodbye Geeks,"Cast members of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” held their first organized reading on Friday of the Broadway musical’s new script, which jettisons the director Julie Taymor’s Geek Chorus of narrators and reduces her villainess Arachne to a supporting character, according to two members of the production who attended the reading. The new script beefs up the role of another villain, the Green Goblin (right, played by Patrick Page, battling Reeve Carney as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), who proved popular with focus groups that the producers convened after the onslaught of negative reviews by theater critics. Most of the changes will be implemented during the show’s hiatus, which starts April 19, according to the two production members, who would only speak anonymously because the producers do not want the changes discussed publicly. On Thursday, the producers said that the choreographer Chase Brock would stage new musical numbers. Mr. Brock, 27, is best known for his choreography on a popular video game, the Broadway Experience. He takes over from Daniel Ezralow. The producers ousted Ms. Taymor this month; Mr. Ezralow said at the time that he was directly assured that he would continue with the show. Ben Brantley, the chief theater critic of The New York Times, wrote in February that the musical may “rank among the worst” in Broadway history and that Mr. Ezralow’s choreography was “pure vintage MTV.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/theater/a-new-script-for-spider-man-goodbye-geeks.html

It’s not quite a bar, because the not-quite-a-bartender who stands behind it can’t pour glasses of beer for customers to sip while filling prescriptions or perusing the shampoo selection. Instead, he sells growlers, refillable glass bottles, for $3.99. And for $7.99, he fills them with one of nine varieties of beer on tap, like Sixpoint Sweet Action or Ithaca Apricot Wheat. Last year, a Duane Reade in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, became the city’s first with a beer counter. It was such a hit, said Richard Ruiz, the Broadway store’s manager, that it is being repeated. “Everyone slows down when they pass this section,” said Julio Vega, who was manning the counter one recent afternoon.

Xinhua, citing a meeting on Wednesday of the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, said that the central government would report the final budget for those expenses to the National People’s Congress, a rubber-stamp legislature, and make the accounting available for public scrutiny. Xinhua cited one official saying a crackdown on extravagant spending had saved the nation nearly $900 million last year.

2011-03-28,Head of College Board to Depart Next Year,"Gaston Caperton, who as president of the College Board is the ultimate proctor of the SAT and Advanced Placement exams, announced Friday that he would step down in June 2012. Mr. Caperton, 71, a former Democratic governor of West Virginia, has led the College Board since 1999. A search for his successor is expected to begin soon, the board said. Mr. Caperton has presided over a period of enormous growth at the College Board, as the number of students who took one of its exams or its courses grew to over 7 million last year, compared with 3 million in 1999, the organization said. Among his accomplishments, the board said, was tripling the number of low-income students who took at least one Advanced Placement course. In that time, though, the SAT has lost ground to its chief rival, the ACT, a college entrance exam that tends to measure more of what students learn in the classroom than the SAT, which can be more of a yardstick of analytical skills.

2011-03-28,Living Color,"Next month, the Indianapolis Museum of Art will open to the public the house that Eero Saarinen designed for the industrialist J. Irwin Miller and his wife, Xenia, giving design pilgrims one more reason to visit Columbus, Ind., the mecca of Modernist architecture that Miller sponsored. The stone- and glass-walled house, which Saarinen completed in 1957, includes about 14 acres of landscaping by Dan Kiley and meticulously preserved interiors by Alexander Girard, who sank the world’s first conversation pit into its living room. The Eames Aluminum Group chairs were designed for the Millers, whose dining table was a precursor to Saarinen’s Tulip pedestal series. The couple lived in the house until their deaths (his in 2004, hers in 2008) and left behind a portrait not just of enlightened 20th-century arts patronage but of family life as well. “It’s not like the Farnsworth House, which was a weekend getaway, or the Glass House, which is purely an architect’s personal expression of his ideas,” says Bradley Brooks, the museum’s director of historic resources. “It had to accommodate entertaining and employees and five kids, and yet it was still resolved so beautifully.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/living-color/

Written by Sophie Lovell and Klaus Kemp, the book examines Rams’s “less but better” philosophy, as illustrated by the hundreds of products (like the coffee grinder shown here) that he produced for Braun, as well as by the iconic 606 shelving system for Vitsoe, still in production after 50 years. On May 2, the Vitsoe shop at 33 Bond Street will open an exhibition of early 606 pieces, while Braun is producing watches — including the one shown here — inspired by models that Rams and Dietrich Lubs designed in the 1970s.

The show’s focus is on the Republic of Benin, where voodoo orginated, and the objects can be mind-boggling in their dense, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink assemblage. But according to the exhibition’s co-curator, Leanne Sacramone, we can now only imagine the circumstances of their creation.

For several seasons, she tried to prod listeners, and perhaps performers, to think differently about music by bringing in artists from other disciplines to discuss what they do. More recently, Ms. Bond has reconfigured the series as a new-music festival. Chat remains a component, but now it is entirely musical: each performance is introduced by an interview with the composer, and Ms. Bond is adept at getting composers to speak concisely about their goals and processes.

2011-03-31,Artists to Transform Bowery’s Roll-Down Gates,"There probably won’t be many New Yorkers mourning the death of the security roll-down gate, that unlovely after-hours face of the city’s storefronts. In 2009 the City Council, citing high rates of graffiti, voted to begin slowly phasing out the gates in favor of rolling grilles. But for at least a couple of months this summer, roll gates and paint will have a last hurrah together, courtesy of the New Museum and the Art Production Fund. As part of the Festival of Ideas for the New City — a series of arts and civic events that the New Museum and other downtown cultural institutions will conduct from May 4 through 8 — 17 artists have been recruited to create paintings that will soon start appearing on roll-down gates along the Bowery, from Houston Street to Canal Street. The artists — among them Mary Heilmann, Glenn Ligon and Ingrid Calame — have created the images but will hand off the actual painting chores to Colossal Media, a Brooklyn-based company. “It removes itself from the practice of real graffiti, but it plays with the idea,” said Yvonne Force Villareal, a co-founder of the Art Production Fund. She said that she and others involved with the project, to be called “After Hours: Murals on the Bowery,” first combed the Bowery at night, then spent months talking to property owners. Next comes power washing and, within the next several weeks, she said, the murals will start to appear for anyone interested in nocturnal Bowery art appreciation. They will remain for two months.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/arts/design/artists-to-transform-bowerys-roll-down-gates.html

On Wednesday night, reports surfaced that HBO had canceled its drama “In Treatment,” which has starred Gabriel Byrne as the psychotherapist Dr. Paul Weston, and featured a rotating roster of actors including Hope Davis, Debra Winger and Mia Wasikowska as his patients. Dianne Wiest and Amy Ryan also starred, as Dr. Weston’s own therapists. And while a cigar is sometimes just a cigar, HBO seemed to suggest that this cancellation was not necessarily a cancellation. In a statement, the network said: “It’s true that we have no plans to continue with ‘In Treatment’ as previously formatted. However, we are in continued conversations with the executive producers to find another way to continue telling these rich stories.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/future-of-hbos-in-treatment-is-couched-in-mystery/
2011-03-31,Sight Lines,"Precocious and self-possessed, Charlotte Perriand was a girl among men, admitted to the ranks of the architects whose names would become synonymous with the new century, at an age when her outlook on design and the world was still in formation. In what would prove to be one of Modernism’s signal images, she reclines in the chaise longue she designed in collaboration with Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. It was, in Le Corbusier’s utopian terms, a “machine for resting in,” and as if to remind us that it’s the chair, not the woman, being presented for our consideration, her face is turned away; she is at once familiar and unrecognizable. That the design of their now-famous furniture was for many years attributed to Le Corbusier alone, that most of her architectural projects never made it past the drawing board, that her far-ranging commissions defied easy classification, that her most significant projects are either gone or off the beaten path: all this only contributed to the enigma. Now, 12 years after her death, at 96, “Charlotte Perriand: Photography: A Wide-Angle Eye,” by Jacques Barsac (5 Continents Editions), offers an intimate glimpse of the woman and the workings of her mind.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/sight-lines/

This isn’t an April Fool’s joke — it’s “Disco Silencio!” (Silent Disco), an exhibition that runs through May 5. The architect Barbara Bestor, an alumna of the institute, and her firm have designed what they call “a plywood polyhedron of hedonism.” Incorporating technologies of surface deception inspired by World War I Razzle Dazzle camouflage, which used bold graphic and anamorphic surfaces to mislead enemy bombers about the size, speed and direction of warships, the crew at Bestor Architecture built an overscaled plywood polyhedron structure in the gallery space. They covered it with a lively graphic surface embedded with fragments of mirrored disco ball, that emblem of 1980s night life, which also distort the space by refracting light. Bestor, whose firm operates under the contemporary manifesto that everyone should experience strange beauty every day, combines deception and illusion of both the serious and the frivolous kind in “Disco Silencio!”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/seeing-things-disco-silencio/

It doesn’t just hit the road, it also wobbles and weaves and executes a diabolically jaunty victory lap, leaving a long bloody smear in its increasingly brutal wake. This being a conceptual horror flick, the tire also runs wild while some onlookers play the Greek chorus and in-house audience both, commenting on the movie as it happens. “It’s already boring,” says one.

2011-04-01,Need a Broad? Call Turner,"IN Matthew Lombardo’s play “High,” Kathleen Turner plays a nun, of all people. This is the same actress whose character in “Body Heat” had a thermostat set so high she melted the brains and willpower of any man who got too close; who was a contract killer in “Prizzi’s Honor” and a prostitute in “Crimes of Passion”; and who in her previous Broadway appearance, in 2005, played a notably blowsy and vicious Martha in an acclaimed revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Before that, in 2002, she was the main reason for seeing the ill-conceived Broadway version of “The Graduate,” because in one scene she wore only a pair of high heels.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/theater/need-a-broad-call-turner.html

2011-04-01,Traveling With Autism,"Those who work with or are related to people with disabilities can get considerable encouragement from “Wretches & Jabberers,” a documentary about two autistic men who learned only in adulthood how to use a keyboard to convey their thoughts and needs. But the film also has a message for a different group: the technical wizards who develop communication devices. Gerardine Wurzburg, the director, is not shy about showing that even though her subjects now have a way to communicate, it is a painstaking process; perhaps this film will encourage engineers and software developers to keep the innovations coming.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/movies/wretches-jabberers-a-documentary-on-autism-review.html
