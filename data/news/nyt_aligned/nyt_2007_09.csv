The future of both men is unclear, the executive briefed on the plans said, but added that the network was hoping to retain them at CBS News. Ms. Ross will most likely overhaul the show, which will change its format in January when CBS ends a deal that allowed some affiliates to use only portions of the first hour of “The Early Show,” supplementing them with local news.

2007-09-03,PBS to Distribute Two Versions of Ken Burns Film,"PBS, bowing to concerns of local stations over the Federal Communications Commission’s policy on indecent speech, plans to distribute two versions of Ken Burns’s 14 1/2-hour documentary on World War II, one unedited and the other with four obscene words edited out so that the viewer hears nothing. It’s not known how many stations will air the edited version of “The War,” which begins on Sept. 23. Stations that broadcast obscene words between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. risk fines if viewers complain. F.C.C. policy is not to decide in advance on possible indecency, but the commission had previously ruled that obscenity in Steven Spielberg’s film “Saving Private Ryan” was not indecent, given the World War II context. All the lawyers PBS consulted agreed that the unedited version was legally defensible in light of the “Ryan” decision, said John Boland, chief content officer of PBS. But after months of debate, he said, PBS decided also to offer the edited version because many stations plan to rerun episodes during the day on weekends, when children could be watching. Caroline Fredrickson, director of the Washington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that the PBS decision “clearly settles any question about the chilling effect of the F.C.C.’s vague and contradictory indecency regime,” adding that broadcasters “should not have to guess” if a work is indecent.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/01/arts/01arts-PBSTODISTRIB_BRF.html

2007-09-03,Inside the List,"DR. SEUSS AND JIMI HENDRIX: Denis Johnson, whose story collection “Jesus’ Son” was voted one of the most important works of fiction of the last 25 years in the Book Review’s 2006 poll of writers and critics, has never placed a book on the Times best-seller list. But he’s been on the radar screen here since his first book, a collection of poems called “The Incognito Lounge,” was released in 1982. Alan Williamson reviewed it in the Book Review, along with two other books of poems, and he presciently wrote: “He is the only one who convinces me that he suffers over the anomie he describes. He is hard on himself, as well as on the culture; and he is agonizingly aware that life can be, and has been, different from the life around him. Pain can make his work excessively and awkwardly rhetorical, but he knows how to use his eyes.” In 1984, the Book Review asked Johnson about his influences. Here’s part of his excellent response: “My ear for the diction and rhythms of poetry was trained by — in chronological order — Dr. Seuss, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, the guitar solos of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, and T. S. Eliot. Other influences come and go, but those I admire the most and those I admired the earliest (I still admire them) have something to say in every line I write. I don’t like William Faulkner. I think Wallace Stevens writes like the photograph of a person, not a person. But they too have had their effect on me.” Johnson’s new novel is reviewed on this week’s cover.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/02tbr.html

2007-09-03,The Music Man,"Rick Rubin is listening. A song by a new band called the Gossip is playing, and he is concentrating. He appears to be in a trance. His eyes are tightly closed and he is swaying back and forth to the beat, trying at once to hear what is right and wrong about the music. Rubin, who resembles a medium-size bear with a long, gray beard, is curled into the corner of a tufted velvet couch in the library of a house he owns but where he no longer lives. This three-story 1923 Spanish villa steeped in music history — Johnny Cash recorded in the basement studio; Jakob Dylan is recording a solo album there now — is used by Rubin for meetings. And ever since May, when he officially became co-head of Columbia Records, Rubin has been having nearly constant meetings. Beginning in 1984, when he started Def Jam Recordings, until his more recent occupation as a career-transforming, chart-topping, Grammy Award-winning producer for dozens of artists, as diverse as the Dixie Chicks, Slayer, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Neil Diamond, Rubin, who is 44, has never gone to an office of any kind. One of his conditions for taking the job at Sony, which owns Columbia, was that he wouldn't be required to have a desk or a phone in any of the corporate outposts. That wasn't a problem: Columbia didn't want Rubin to punch a clock. It wanted him to save the company.

Her book is not about the power that Israel exercises over the Palestinians, nor is it about the power that the “Israel lobby” is commonly thought to exercise over United States foreign policy. Israel and the “lobby” now tend to be regarded in Europe and perhaps also, but to a lesser extent, in the United States, as Jewish projects inimical to the causes of justice and international security. A new book on either of these topics would be but a minor addition to a substantial industry — that Israel oppresses Palestinians by denying them a state, and oppresses Americans by denying them control over their state, has become the received wisdom of the times.

Fahey, a professor of animal and nutritional sciences, could open a spout by hand, fill a bag with whatever happened to ooze out and calculate how much the dog had digested before whatever it had not digested could move farther through its body. The plastic tubing was inserted in the ileum — the exact spot where food absorption ends and fermentation by the microflora and bacteria of the lower bowel begins. Given a large enough sample of any dog food, George Fahey could calculate how much vitamin or mineral or fat or sugar would enter a dog’s bloodstream and how much would be irretrievably lost.

2007-09-03,Nonfiction Chronicle,"MARC CHAGALL. By Jonathan Wilson. (Nextbook/Schocken, $19.95.) Wilson is not the only one who has had a Marc Chagall print on his dorm-room wall — only to discover later that sophisticated people look down on the artist. Most of us have moved on. Luckily, Wilson has not. Critics say Chagall (1887-1985) is near kitsch, and in his lovely, wise book, Wilson often agrees: he refers to “the ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ Chagall” because that Broadway musical’s title alludes to one of his 1920 wall panels for a Yiddish theater. Apparently, sentimentality ran in the family: on Yom Kippur, “Chagall’s father wrote an instructional ‘Weep’ in his wife’s prayer book next to certain passages.” As Wilson explains, Chagall, too, sometimes made an appeal for “a ritualized lachrymose response,” at least in his lesser work. There are other problems: Chagall “frequently, almost obsessively, chooses Christ as his central symbol of martyrdom” — even in depictions of Jewish history and the Holocaust. Moreover, Chagall’s behavior was at times “a disgrace,” as his daughter put it, expressing frustration over his refusal to provide prints for a 1970 International Rescue Committee exhibit at the request of Varian Fry, who had saved Chagall and more than 1,500 other Jews in Nazi-dominated Europe. Nevertheless, Wilson, the author of “A Palestine Affair” and other books, depicts Chagall as a luftmensch — not in the word’s metaphorical sense (“an individual overly involved in intellectual pursuits”) but in its literal one: “man of the air.” His paintings of adoring couples, “valentines” to his wife, Bella, levitate above “Fiddler” ooze, Jesus portraits and personal shortcomings and are rightly “adored by crowds of young lovers and those yearning for love, who have taken to them as lasting images of romantic persistence in the face of a world gone mad.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/McKelvey-t.html

2007-09-03,Letters,"Mark Lilla (Aug. 19) is right to conclude his review of the intertwining of politics and religion by suggesting that instead of trying to make Muslims more like us, we must allow them to draw on the “theological resources within their own traditions” to “create a decent and workable political order.” Although he concedes that within our own tradition this kind of internal reformation was once possible, he believes that today it is not. Instead, we must rely entirely on “our own lucidity,” since religiously inspired hopes for a better world almost always generate violence. But the evidence from the French revolutionary terror to Hiroshima and the Gulag indicates that lucidity (reason?) can be at least as lethal a basis for political life; whereas biblically informed prophets like Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. can still inspire healthy, nonviolent change. The real challenge of Islam to Western intellectual discourse is for us to ask ourselves whether our unprecedented modern experiment of conducting political life with no transcendent values is really working out as well as once hoped, and if it is not, how can we draw on our own traditions, as we hope the Muslims draw on theirs, to craft a viable way to live together?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02letters-t-1.html

It comes with the armor and accoutrements of a Major Novel: big historical theme (Vietnam), semi-mythical cultural institution (military intelligence), long time span (1963-70, with a coda set in 1983) and unreasonable length (614 pages), all of which would be off-putting if this were not, in fact, a major novel, and if Johnson’s last big book hadn’t been the small collection of eccentric and addictive short stories called “Jesus’ Son” (1992). “Tree of Smoke” is a soulful book, even a numinous one (it’s dedicated “Again for H.P.” and I’ll bet you a bundle that stands for “higher power”), and it ought to secure Johnson’s status as a revelator for this still new century — a prediction I voice confidently but reluctantly, and with a little disappointment and dismay.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/Lewis3-t.html

Despite that fresh green name worthy of some rural retreat, Ramalhete was a large stern house of sober walls, with a line of narrow wrought-iron balconies on the second floor, and, above that, a row of timid little windows sheltering under the eaves, a house which, as befitted a building dating from the reign of Queen Maria I, had the gloomy appearance of an ecclesiastical residence, and indeed, to complete its resemblance to a Jesuit college, it needed only a bell and a cross. The name, Ramalhete, doubtless came from the square panel of decorative tiles placed in the spot intended for a coat of arms that had never materialised, and which depicted a large bunch of sunflowers tied with a ribbon on which one could still just make out the letters and numbers of a date.

2007-09-03,Havel Withdraws Playfrom Czech Theater," Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, has withdrawn his eagerly anticipated new drama from the National Theater in Prague after it refused to allow his wife to play the leading role, The Guardian of London reported. Mr. Havel, right, 70, who retired from the presidency four years ago, maintains that he wrote the play, “Odchazeni” (“Leaving”), for his wife, Dagmar Havlova, and said that if she could not star in it, he would take it to another theater. The play deals with the problems of a former high-ranking politician in surrendering the trappings of power. Although Mr. Havel’s stance has led to accusations that he is being highhanded, he said that he had promised his wife for years that they would collaborate onstage and that she inspired him to write the play. “She was present when I was writing it in the U.S. some months ago,” he said. Referring to the presidency, he said: “She lived alongside me. I wrote it for her. I imagined her being in it.” Ms. Havlova, who called the dispute “undignified and embarrassing,” has independently announced her withdrawal from the production. The National Theater said its policy is not to allow guest actors. The theater’s director, Ondrej Cerny, said, “The National Theater would still like to perform the newest Vaclav Havel drama, and we will try to open new talks.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/arts/03ARTS-HAVELWITHDRA_BRF.html

The academy is asserting its right to buy the two Pickford statuettes and one owned by her husband, Buddy Rogers (1904-99), for $10, under bylaws dating from 1950 and in accordance with agreements signed by Oscar winners. When Mr. Rogers died, all three Oscars went to his second wife, Beverly, who died in January, leaving them to her heirs, who are co-executors of her estate. Pickford, above, known as America’s Sweetheart, won the Academy Award for best actress for “Coquette” (1929) and was given an honorary Oscar in 1975. Mr. Rogers won the academy’s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1986. The academy said one heir asked it for $500,000 in July for one of the Oscars. David W. Quinto, a lawyer for the academy, said, “If the public believes that any multimillionaire can buy an Oscar, then it becomes cheapened.” A call to John Shevlin, a lawyer for the estate of Beverly Rogers, was not immediately returned.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/arts/03ARTS-PICKFORDSOSC_BRF.html

Last week’s concerts received little press coverage, partly because of a three-day holiday when newspapers were not published.

Narciso Rodriguez was in the middle of fittings when I stopped by his studio near Union Square. His partnership with Liz Claiborne is really beginning to make a difference. It means more workers and pattern makers in his sample room. It means having access to great fabrics and embroideries again. Two looks for his spring collection caught my eye: a sweet shirt dress in burnt orange silk with a kimono-like neckline and a short flaring skirt, and a slim gray pantsuit with a narrow-shoulder jacket that had a coy double effect at the hem. The shapes were new, the fit perfect. Oh, what a difference a little money makes. I know expectations are high for his show (on Sept. 9), and in reality we probably won’t see the full weight of the Liz deal for at least another six months, but Rodriguez is certainly in a better position today.",Fashion & Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/narcisos-next-act/

2007-09-05,2 More Candles for a Firefighter Memorial,"At the Firemen's Memorial, candles for Firefighters Joseph Graffagnino and Robert Beddia, who died on Aug. 18. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) More PhotographsTwo new candles burn at the foot of the Firemen's Memorial in Riverside Park on its 94th anniversary today. They honor Firefighter Joseph Graffagnino of Ladder Company 5 and Firefighter Robert Beddia of Engine Company 24, who were killed Aug. 18 at the former Deutsche Bank building opposite ground zero.  ""New York is adorned with monuments to soldiers and statesmen, and it should have a monument to typify the splendid heroism of this department,"" said Henry C. Potter, the Episcopal bishop of New York, at the funeral of Deputy Fire Chief Charles W. Kruger in February 1908.  This will sound familiar: it took five years to get the memorial built.  There were money problems, of course.  Then there were bitter fights over its location. Union Square was first proposed, but the Fire Department did not want its solemn monument anywhere near that gathering spot for agitators and demonstrations.  There was also a debate over the design, by the architect Harold Van Buren Magonigle and the sculptor Attilio Piccirilli, who also collaborated on the Maine Monument at Columbus Circle. (Piccirilli's mother-and-child groupings at both monuments bear a striking resemblance.)  To complicate matters further, Bishop Potter, the original head of the memorial committee, died five months after Chief Kruger's funeral. He was succeeded by Isidor Straus, who perished aboard the Titanic in 1912.  But finally, on Sept. 5, 1913, the Firemen's Memorial was dedicated at the foot of 100th Street. Four girls whose fathers had died in the line of duty unveiled the imposing marble structure, with sculptures at either end and a bas relief in its center, above a spout filling a broad basin with life-saving water.  At the time the memorial was dedicated, the Fire Department had lost 154 men in its entire history. Since then, 983 more firefighters have been killed on the job -- more than one-third of those on 9/11 alone.  Memorial inscriptions can sometimes be a bit bombastic, but there is no quarreling with the notion expressed here that firefighters are ""soldiers in a war that never ends.""  All you have to do is spend a moment with those two new candles. ",Blogs,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/blogs/05cityroom-2-more-c779.html

Her addition, like that of Ms. Goldberg, is intended to give a measure of stability to the show, which lost Rosie O’Donnell last spring and will lose another panelist, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, albeit temporarily, to a maternity leave that is to begin later this year.

Other environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, have endorsed an agreement on the project announced yesterday by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Under the plan, the developer, Dean Gitter, agreed to sell more than 1,200 acres of land he owns in the Catskills to the state to become part of the forest preserve. A scaled-down development would then be concentrated on 620 acres that Mr. Gitter owns next to the state-run Belleayre Mountain Ski Center. Carolyn Zolas, the chairwoman of the watershed committee of the Sierra Club’s Atlantic chapter, said the project was still far too big for such a sensitive area and could end up sending contaminated runoff into the reservoirs.

The corpse of Dariusz Janiszewski showed signs of starvation and torture; his hands were bound behind his back, and a noose circled his neck. The case had baffled investigators for five years, until a tip led them to Mr. Bala’s 2003 debut novel, “Amok,” which contained similarities to the crime that raised police suspicion. In its decision a court in Wroclaw, Poland, ruled that Mr. Bala, 34, planned and directed the killing but found that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of carrying out the murder himself. Judge Lidia Hojenska said significant circumstantial evidence led the court to conclude that Mr. Bala had been driven to kill Mr. Janiszewski, the owner of a small advertising agency, because he suspected him of having an affair with his estranged wife. Mr. Bala sat stone-faced between two policemen as the verdict was read. His family and lawyer said they planned an appeal. The court noted one difference between Mr. Bala’s fiction and the actual killing. In “Amok,” the narrator got away with the murder.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/books/06arts-POLISHAUTHOR_BRF.html

The department said it still planned to request proposals for future vending, but added that it would consider “prior experience, longstanding community relations and the variety of cuisine offered.”",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/nyregion/07mbrfs-vendors.html

The clinic has examined more than 15,000 workers and volunteers and overseen the examination of 5,000 more at clinics elsewhere; received more than $100 million from the federal government for tracking and treating those workers; published the largest and most often quoted study of recovery workers’ ills; and testified about the health problems before city and federal committees.But as a front-page investigation by Anthony DePalma and Serge F. Kovaleski shows, the clinic’s performance in several important areas has been flawed. For years after 9/11, it did not have adequate resources or time to properly collect detailed medical data on workers exposed to ground zero dust. The clinic’s doctors presented their findings in what other experts say were scientifically questionable ways, exaggerating the health effects with imprecise descriptions of workers’ symptoms and how long they might be sick. And researchers in the field say that the clinic’s data collection was so badly planned that its usefulness may be limited.

2007-09-07,A Seedy Landmark Goes Dark,"Until just a few weeks ago, the World Trade Center continued to glow at night on the facade of the Playpen cinema. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) More PhotographsThe homogenization of the Times Square area (yes, The Times has contributed to the phenomenon with its new headquarters opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal) has claimed another quirky victim: the Playpen, a former cinema that closed recently after 90-odd years.  Very odd years.  The Playpen is part of a larger parcel at the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 44th Street that is owned by a partnership including affiliates of the Tishman Realty Corporation. The partners have not gone public with their plans. They may not even have decided yet among themselves. But the future certainly does not include the old theater.  What Eighth Avenue will lose with its disappearance is more than an adults-only emporium with suggestive neon come-ons -- ""Live Girls,"" ""Preview Booths,"" ""Leather & Lace."" It will lose the last home of the Funny Store, an almost vaudevillian novelty shop. It will lose one of the most distinctive façades of any surviving theater from the early 20th century, a kind of heroic Palladian composition. And will lose a three-dimensional history lesson in the evolution of Times Square.  The Ideal Theater, designed by Eisendrath & Horwitz, opened in 1916 as a modest movie house, with 598 seats. It attracted some notice in 1935 for showing an Italian-language movie, ""Dopo una Notte d'Amore"" (""After a Night of Love""). Briefly known as the Esquire, it stayed in business until early 1937. It reopened a few months later as the Squire. In 1939, it was renamed the Cinecitta and played Italian films for a while.  Once again the Squire in 1941, it showed ""The Eternal Gift,"" said to be the first feature-length depiction of the Roman Catholic high mass, and the documentary, ""Greece on the March.""  Such serious fare had disappeared by 1946, when ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"" topped the bill. During a tense moment on screen one evening, a 10-by-20-foot section of the theater's ceiling fell down, injuring 19 patrons. Those in the front seats were unruffled, thinking they were hearing weird sound effects. By the 1950s, ""girlie"" films were drawing customers to the Squire.  The theater's next transformation occurred in 1956, when it reopened as the New Cameo, a theater devoted to Russian films, beginning with the Mosfilm production of ""Boris Godunov,"" starring Alexander Pirogov. ""A casual observer must shudder at the thought of the terrible shock and dismay of a former Squire patron who might wander into the theater looking wistfully for Rose La Rose or Lili St. Cyr,"" wrote Bosley Crowther, who was then The Times's movie critic.  Eventually, the theater became simply the Cameo. This was its most fitting name since the central arch is flanked sculptural cameos, showing women in diaphanous robes, one with a spool of movie film and the other with a camera. The Cameo was the showcase in 1970 for the blue movie, ""Sexual Freedom in Denmark.""  Blue gave way to X over time, and then the ""Cameo"" on the marquee gave way to the Adonis, when that gay movie theater was pushed out of its home six blocks north on Eighth Avenue. The new Adonis was closed by the city's Department of Health in 1994 after inspectors observed what they called ""high-risk sexual activities"" taking place among patrons, without ""any attempts to monitor or control them.""  Lately, the theater was the Playpen, whose marquee loosely traced the New York skyline in red neon. It included the twin towers of the World Trade Center, which still stood and still glowed at night in their uptown incarnation. And yes, Eighth Avenue is losing those, too.

I am thankful for the support of my family and friends.” Ms. Hudgens plays Gabriella, one of the six principal characters in “High School Musical” and “High School Musical 2,” which drew upwards of 17 million viewers, many of them elementary- and middle-school students, in its first showing on the Disney Channel last month. It was not immediately clear how the image of Ms. Hudgens, 18, had made its way into cyberspace. When asked how the photo would affect her participation in Disney’s promotion of “High School Musical 2,” soon to be shown in more than a dozen countries, or on the casting of a coming big-screen adaptation, Patti McTeague, a Disney Channel spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message: “Walt Disney Studios doesn’t comment on specifics of any negotiation.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/arts/08arts-HIGHSCHOOLFO_BRF.html

The Community Board around Bryant Park has raised concerns about the size of the event, and the group that runs the park recently had a public spat with the organizers of Fashion Week. Now, there are reports that the event could move in two years — possibly to the rooftop of the Port Authority Bus Terminal two blocks west. We asked a sample of people around Bryant Park, home to the main Fashion Week events, what they thought about, well, not being able to get in. The reactions ranged from resignation to amusement.

Darius instead relates a different story, one from his childhood that has weighed on his conscience ever since, a story that also involves birds but in which he is abuser rather than savior.

2007-09-10,Social Networking Site,"Back in 2003, Kimberly Stouffer worked at an advertising firm that was marketing a new, 184-unit, midrise condominium in a downtown neighborhood of San Diego called East Village. It was a challenging gig for an ambitious up-and-comer. San Diegans were relatively new to the idea of high-density living, having preferred for decades to sprawl into the suburbs. And among the eight downtown neighborhoods undergoing redevelopment, East Village was the sketchiest. Although there was a brand-new major league ballpark just one block away, the area was better known for homeless shelters and drug and alcohol rehab centers. (The condo building site itself was the former location of the San Diego Rescue Mission Men’s Center.) Not only was the location dicey, but the market would also be tricky. The project’s developer, Barratt American, was taking aim at the last of the Gen Xers (then in their late 20s and early 30s), a group that had long been portrayed as comically indecisive and confused by even the most basic challenges of adult life. Stouffer found herself asking the question, What sort of life do these young people want to live now that they are, at long last, entering independent adulthood? Stouffer had the advantage of being one of those young people herself. At the time she started the campaign, she was 27. A few years earlier, she moved to California after graduating from the University of Central Florida, where she got a bachelor’s degree in communications. Unlike the stereotypes of early Gen Xers, Stouffer was put together and enterprising. At first she moved to La Jolla, but she wanted to live closer to her work in San Diego and chafed at dropping $1,200 a month for rent. She was single and couldn’t see herself living in a cul-de-sac. And she wanted to be in the mix where she could meet guys as motivated and successful as herself.",Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/realestate/keymagazine/909CONDOS-txt.html

Not that some in the audience will care much about the writer’s needs by then, having sat by and watched as he gratified them while neglecting everybody else’s — including, in the case of Jeffrey Lent’s third novel, “A Peculiar Grace,” the presumptive desire of his protagonist (a middle-aged, stoic loner named Hewitt Pearce who loved and lost and must learn to love again).

During that period, only 4.4 million Americans over 60 moved away. Those figures don’t seem likely to change anytime soon. Last year, AARP surveyed Americans over 50 and found that 89 percent wanted to stay in their current home as long as possible. “Americans are going to age in place,” says Elinor Ginzler, AARP’s director for livable communities.

Walking home from the train station on some evenings, I’ve tried to imagine how it must have felt to hike through the neighborhood in the 1920s, not long after its transition to suburbia, just after the first families began moving in. Actually, I’ve seen some photographs. Set like large wooden blocks in a nearly barren landscape, the rows of houses evoke a desolation akin to what I’ve experienced in subdivisions stamped out by big home-building companies all over the United States — places that aren’t neighborhoods yet but outposts, lonely agglomerations of houses holding on for dear life to the hems of their metro areas.",Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/realestate/keymagazine/909LEDE-t.html

To the end of his life, he maintained his stance as an uncompromising atheist, the stance he is best known for down to the present. In “The Future of an Illusion,” he described belief in God as a collective neurosis: he called it “longing for a father.” But in his last completed book, “Moses and Monotheism,” something new emerges. There Freud, without abandoning his atheism, begins to see the Jewish faith that he was born into as a source of cultural progress in the past and of personal inspiration in the present.

(The “t” at the end of “Danticat” is the result of a clerical error on her father’s birth certificate.) When Dantica fled Haiti in 2004, after a battle between United Nations peacekeepers and chimères — gang members — destroyed his church and put his life in jeopardy, he was 81, with high blood pressure and heart problems, and yet for 30 years had resisted his family’s pleas to emigrate to the States. He intended to return and rebuild his church as soon as the fighting stopped. But to the Department of Homeland Security officers who examined him in Miami, his plea for temporary asylum meant he was simply another unlucky Haitian determined to slip through their fingers. When he collapsed during his “credible fear” interview and began vomiting, the medic on duty announced, “He’s faking.” That refusal of treatment cost him his life: he died in a Florida hospital, probably in shackles, the following day.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/review/Row-t.html

The price of the entire project is not known, but the client can see all costs. In fixed-price, there’s an agreement to do the entire project for a set sum. The client has no idea what he’s being charged for, but he knows the final cost. SYLVESTER: If you’ve got detailed construction documents, I’d get a fixed price. Cost-plus, or time-and-materials, works better if you don’t have the plans or are going to make significant changes. LICHT: I recommend a fixed price. If someone says it will be X dollars, you know it will be X dollars. With a time-and-materials contract, you need to keep an eye on what you are being charged for. FANUKA: Time-and-materials contracts are bad because the contractor is obligated to go as slow as possible, because he’s making money every day he is there.",Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/realestate/keymagazine/909ASK-t.html

2007-09-10,Pop Culture Chronicle,"CELEBRITY SECRETS: Government Files on the Rich and Famous. By Nick Redfern. (Paraview Pocket Books, paper, $14.) The most important periodical of our time, Us Weekly, has already put it best: Stars, they’re just like us. They abuse narcotics, consort with enemies of the state and haggle with prostitutes over services rendered. We know this because our government, when it was not otherwise occupied battling the menaces of Nazism and Communism, was keeping tabs on our most celebrated actors, artists and musicians, with a doggedness that would put any tabloid editor to shame. Redfern, a freelance journalist, knows this because he obtained declassified files the C.I.A., F.B.I. and other federal agencies kept on outspoken stars like Frank Sinatra and John Lennon, and on such seemingly upstanding citizens as John Wayne and John Denver. From Jimi Hendrix’s Army file, we learn that this future rock god “requires excessive supervision at all times” and “cannot function while performing duties thinking about his guitar.” From F.B.I. documents, we discover that Abbott and Costello were scrutinized for slipping suspicious “key words” into their radio shows. And in Marilyn Monroe’s F.B.I. records, we are told that Norman Mailer is “an eccentric but well-known author.” In small doses, these factoids are good for a laugh. But Redfern’s book paints a progressively damning portrait of a government obsessed with pop culture’s power and paranoid about controlling its message, as unnerved by the possibility of a riot breaking out at a Beatles concert as it is by the thought of Rock Hudson portraying an F.B.I. agent in a motion picture.

We must take this endorsement with a grain of salt, of course, since Leonard King is one of Marche’s own inventions. So too is Sanjania itself.

There were blasts from pistols, handguns, automatic weapons, whose thundering rounds sounded like rockets. It was the third of such military operations in Bel Air in as many weeks, but never had the firing sounded so close or so loud.

He suspected that his mother, at least, was suffering, but that she stayed farther back to allow him most of the warmth. Outside it was either snowing or raining; Alexander could not be sure which. It had been dark since three o'clock. They had dined at noon; tea had been brought in at four, and there were still another three hours before bed.

Suddenly, on August 10, the Domei News Agency broadcast a statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that Japan was ready to accept the surrender terms presented by the Allies in the so- called Potsdam Declaration on July 26, ""provided that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler."" The announcement surprised even top officials in Washington. ""When the Japanese surrendered it caught the whole goddamn administrative machinery with their pants down,"" recalled a colonel in the Army high command. At the time the official notification was received via neutral embassies, Secretary of War Henry Stimson was about to leave on vacation, and the army and navy were opening another round in their continuing squabble about command arrangements for the impending invasion of Japan.

Where is he in formation? Where is the ground? How close is he to the target? What's his fuel level? How is his aircraft performing? Are his avionics functioning correctly? Are weather conditions hampering the operation and increasing its risks? Where is the enemy, or where is he likely to be? What are the scope, location, and range of the enemy's air defenses? Is he evaluating new information he perceives or that is communicated to him and altering his expectations accordingly? These are but a few of the scores of variables he must keep track of to increase the likelihood of his mission's success.

Don’t think I’m ungrateful for every invitation I get to a store opening, but fashion’s yen to market itself into oblivion removes much of the genuine fun of a party. The thing that struck me most about Lauren’s party, and was evident from the moment I saw Robert De Niro and Ray Kelly, the city’s police commissioner, walk in, was how much the entire night was about New York. The runway reflected that spirit. As I said in today’s review, the only location better than the park would have been Fifth Avenue. It was a gorgeous high-hat parade, evoking in moments a glossy Robert Frank fascination with that silhouette. (And kudos to Philip Treacy for the hats.)

It was Reno Mahe, who was the Eagles’ semi-regular punt returner the past three seasons. Mahe was not re-signed this year as the Eagles sought to energize their punt-return game, which ranked 10th last season. They turned the job over to J.R. Reed and Greg Lewis, two experienced kickoff returners who nonetheless had never returned a punt in a regular-season game.In Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Packers, it showed. Lewis flubbed a punt, which the Packers recovered in the end zone. Reed flubbed another, which the Packers recovered, unbelievably, at the Eagles’ 35 with 1 minute 9 seconds left in the game and the score tied. They ran three plays and kicked the winning field goal.Which brings us to Mahe, whom the Eagles flew in from his home in Utah.“All they said was, ‘We’re flying you out here, and we’ll see you soon,’ ” Mahe told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday. “I’m just excited to come back.”He signed a one-year contract Tuesday.So what is it about Mahe? In four seasons, he had unremarkable return numbers but only three fumbles, only one of which happened when he was supposed to be catching a punt.",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/reno-mahe-and-more/

(And “rules” about length and quality of comment on the blog? Horrors! Let’s build another prison.)

All the time I say to young designers, “Give me a new contemporary version of sexiness. Show me something other than a sweetheart neckline, a corseted waist, and an Alaïa homage.” I’ve been waiting, and not seeing it. So when I saw the way Jacobs had stripped down those dresses, expressing a natural élan as much as a silhouette that any person can draw upon, he had my vote.

2007-09-13,Small Cars and a Big Mini,"The Mini Clubman is roughly 10 inches longer than the regular Mini Cooper. (Above left, Sascha Schuermann/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images; above right, John MacDougall/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)  Suddenly, being small is big news at the Frankfurt auto show. And like surly subway riders during the morning commute, car manufacturers are busy elbowing their way into the city-car market.   In a prelude to the brand’s arrival next year in the United States, Mercedes-Benz’s Smart division showed new diesel and electric-powered versions of its two-passenger Fortwo model.   Volkswagen introduced the Up! concept car, a sign that it's officially returning to its small car roots. VW was light on the specifics of this 135.8-inch hatchback, but the company did admit that the four-passenger Up! is rear-wheel drive. Should the Up! reach production (and this seems very likely) it would be the first rear-wheel drive small Volkswagen since the original Beetle.  Small car fever isn’t limited to the Germans. Fiat has an elaborate display dedicated to its successful new 500 model, and Toyota unveiled its edgy iQ concept car. Even beleaguered Ford is displaying a stylish new small hatchback called the Verve. A size or two larger than cars like the Fortwo and Up!, the handsome Verve shows that Ford is serious about revamping its small cars – at least in Europe.  Ironically, as all these manufacturers jostle to introduce tiny cars, the auto company whose name is synonymous with small is now thinking big.  BMW’s Mini brand is using Frankfurt to showcase the production version of the new Mini Clubman, a pint-size wagon. At 156.4 inches long, the Clubman is roughly 10 inches longer than the regular Mini Cooper. The Clubman has a novel split “barn door” rear tailgate, rather than the single-piece hatch of the Mini Cooper. Each of the Clubman’s two rear doors has its own wiper and exterior handle. There is even a passenger-side-only, rear-opening half-door. Mini calls this the clubdoor. I call it a smart idea, as it allows easier access to the roomier back seat. With all these clever doors, does the Mini Clubman qualify as the world’s first 4.5-door wagon?  More importantly: Why Mini would risk sacrificing its ""think small"" brand ethos by introducing a less-mini Mini. The answer: bigger sales and profits. According to Mini, the Clubman wagon will help push yearly sales of all Minis past 240,000 in 2008. The Clubman arrives in showrooms later this year.

Impenetrable musings intended to evoke ineffable romantic longing leave you scratching your head as you wait, ever more impatiently, for something to happen.

Pissarro on his own is not blockbuster material; his paintings have a muddy, homely aspect next to Cézannes or Monets or Renoirs. Yet for Pissarro, an anarchist and a Jew (albeit a secular one) in 19th-century France, Impressionism was about much more than the fleeting effects of light. It was about labor, the elimination of hierarchies and an idealized balance between urban and rural life.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/arts/design/14piss.html

Because nothing goes better with bottle service than a barbershop tune about bow ties performed with Charleston-era choreography — twirling walking sticks and all. As with Outkast, authentic old-school style is key. “There’s a part of dressing for performance that’s been lost with contemporary artists,” says Deacon, who lists Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers as inspirations. “We want to go back to that and make it special again.” Their garb is culled from vintage dealers and eBay, as well as from a tailor on 125th Street who “knickers up” their suit pants. But not everything of yore is at their feet. Says Jellyroll with a sigh, “The knee-high argyle socks are the hardest to find.

2007-09-17,The Political and the Divine,"Some of us have been taking the European Enlightenment a little bit for granted. We’ve assumed that, just as natural philosophers like Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler ultimately prevailed in overturning the geocentric model of Ptolemaic cosmology, so, too, moral philosophers like Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke ultimately prevailed in removing ideas of divine revelation and redemption from politics. Progress in both spheres, the scientific and the political, was not only analogous and linked, but also, in some sense, inevitable, at least once rigorous standards of clear thinking were adopted. Let people freely and rationally pursue physics, and eventually they’d draw the conclusion that the Earth moves. Let people freely and rationally think about how best to organize human society — with a view toward diminishing turmoil and augmenting the realization of individual potential — and eventually they’d separate church and state. We’ve assumed the matter has been thankfully settled, at least in the Western intellectual tradition. No wonder, then, that recent years have brought a spate of incredulous “neo-Enlightenment” books — along the lines of Christopher Hitchens’s “God Is Not Great” — all of them barely able to contain their dismay that they even have to be arguing what it is they are arguing.

2007-09-17,Nonfiction Chronicle,"DOMINION OF MEMORIES: Jefferson, Madison, and the Decline of Virginia. By Susan Dunn. (Basic Books, $27.50.) Virginia’s “brilliant, forward-looking, transforming leaders,” Dunn writes, “created a nation” and then controlled the executive branch for 32 of the first 36 years of America’s constitutional government. Virginia was once the wealthiest and most populous state, but by the early decades of the 19th century, its soil had been depleted by primitive farming methods; its schools were “miserable,” according to Jefferson; and its roads were “execrable,” a disgruntled visitor said. Its constitution preserved elitist government long after most states had expanded suffrage, and its plantation aristocracy deliberately hindered the economic dynamism that was modernizing the North. Slavery’s role in the decline of the South is an old story, but Dunn, a professor of humanities at Williams College, finds fresh insights by making a case study of Virginia. She emphasizes the significance of lesser-known figures like Thomas Roderick Dew, who in 1832 published an essay that laid the intellectual groundwork for an uncompromisingly pro-slavery ideology, and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, who anticipated secession with an 1836 novel envisioning a Southern rebellion. Dunn’s chief aim, though, is to show the complicity of Jefferson and Madison in Virginia’s stagnation. Both men strained against plantation dogma, Jefferson because of his egalitarian creed and Madison because of a wavering faith in the national government he’d helped design. Yet they both acquiesced as states’ rights radicals adduced anti-Federalist pronouncements by the two founders to trump moderate opponents. “The seeds of Virginia’s decline had been adroitly planted in fertile soil by the great patriarchs themselves,” Dunn concludes.

Menopause, Wilson argued, was not a natural age-related condition; it was an illness, akin to diabetes or kidney failure, and one that could be treated by taking estrogen to replace the hormones that a woman’s ovaries secreted in ever diminishing amounts. With this argument estrogen evolved into hormone-replacement therapy, or H.R.T., as it came to be called, and became one of the most popular prescription drug treatments in America.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16epidemiology-t.html

This is too bad, because Martin deserves a wider audience — but it can also be a delight for the unsuspecting reader.

And yet, in death as in life, Coward exerts a persistent fascination, inspiring recollections, comment and conjecture, like a captivating guest whom people can’t stop talking about after he leaves the party. There are critical assessments and, considering that Coward left his own version of his life’s events, a surprising number of biographies, as well as repackaged editions of his work: his lyrics anthologized, his witticisms collected.

2007-09-17,Up Front,"In Granta’s recent “Best of Young American Novelists” issue, the novelist Edmund White, one of the contest’s judges, took American writers to task for abandoning homegrown class divisions as a theme, preferring to take their encounters with the less fortunate abroad, in what he called “the Peace Corps novel.” Nell Freudenberger — one of the 21 writers chosen for the Granta list — says she sees his point, but also the difficulty of the enterprise. In her acclaimed books “Lucky Girls” and “The Dissident,” Freudenberger has written about relationships between privileged Americans and people from the developing world in locales ranging from New Delhi to Bangkok to Beverly Hills. “Class is more fluid in America, and much more intertwined with money,” Freudenberger said in an e-mail message. “At the same time, we have a national mythology about classlessness. I think that’s part of the reason I like to write stories from the point of view of people who aren’t American. It’s a way of getting some distance, and hopefully seeing ourselves as Americans a little more clearly.” On this week’s cover, Freudenberger reviews “The Indian Clerk,” David Leavitt’s novel about the Oxford mathematician G. H. Hardy’s friendship with Srinivasa Ramanujan, a modestly educated young man from Madras who turned out to be one of the 20th century’s greatest mathematical minds. “Characters from different cultures have more trouble pinning down each other’s place in the social hierarchy,” Freudenberger wrote in her e-mail message. “That kind of misunderstanding is rich territory for a writer.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Upfront-t.html

2007-09-17,Skinny Dipping,"Born in Britain in the mid-’60s as a tougher offshoot of Mods, skinheads came to prominence a decade later with a strikingly aggressive uniform of Fred Perry polos, Ben Sherman button-downs, thin suspenders, Dr. Martens boots and the shorn skulls that gave them their name. When many began participating in nationalist and racist violence, the group became hated and feared: playing in front of a skinhead backdrop and waving a Union Jack flag in 1992 made Morrissey a pariah in the left-wing music press. (Though portraying one in the skinhead flick “Romper Stomper” that same year kick-started Russell Crowe’s career.) Skinheads went underground until gays, who have disarmed much of the movement’s racism, recently began dragging them out of the closet — the photographer Slava Mogutin included homoerotic pictures of Berlin skinheads in his book “Lost Boys.” Nick Knight’s book “Skinhead,” which launched the fashion photographer’s career, is still selling. The director Shane Meadows’s recent film, “This Is England,” follows an ’80s skinhead. The designer Hedi Slimane’s online photo diary includes an image of a black leather jacket with a patch bearing the name of the early skinhead group Cock Sparrer. And the British singer Paul Weller recently traced his obsessive love of style to his days as a junior skinhead in the late ’60s. And then there are this season’s collections: lace-up bovver boots were spotted at Dior Homme, and Yohji Yamamoto even collaborated with Dr. Martens to update the skinheads’ stomp wear of choice. With no steel in the toecaps, however, the vile associations have been sanitized. ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/style/tmagazine/16skin.html

The second type, rarer in so-called literary fiction, is a novel about people who really existed, recreated by an author who plays with the facts, and especially the intriguing lacunae, of their lives. “The Indian Clerk,” David Leavitt’s richly imagined seventh novel, is such a book, and for several reasons Leavitt is brave to attempt it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Freudenberger-t.html

Yet we’ve not met up today because of Stella and the two, soon to be three, children — though they loom large in the conversation and are, he happily admits, the most important thing in his life — but because of the big success that Willis, 37, is enjoying on his own account.

Bean) and craftsmanship (one-piece vamps and full stocking liners) to make its moccasins the soft-soled favorite of the ironic-taxidermy set. Hand-stitched from rugged materials like moose and bison skins in a variety of classic Down East styles, the shoes come with a scout’s honor from Quoddy to resole boots and bluchers (for a nominal fee) no matter how many summers in Dark Harbor — or barbecues in Williamsburg — they’ve endured.

She spoke to no one, but slammed the doors. She turned her music up loud, talked loudly to her friends on her mobile phone, telling them how stupid her family was and how she hated them all.” As my Irish mother used to say about puberty and growing up, “When children get hair under the arms, they go away for a long time, and it’s a long time before they come back.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/griswold.html

I bought it and put it in the window, where it sold within minutes at a price not far from what it cost new. The attraction, I realized, was precisely that it was worn. In no time at all, no self-respecting Sloane Ranger would be seen without this distinctive olive green coat. Young army officers wore them as part of their mufti, teamed with straw-colored corduroys, suede shoes and red socks. Aspiring bankers adopted the Barbour, and it also became de rigueur over black tie.

2007-09-17,Non-alternative Airport Transportation,"BUSINESS travelers who pack light and like to save money and time as they shuttle among America’s major airports and cities might consider one not-so-trammeled route: rapid transit. Since 1989, more than 30 American metropolitan regions have developed or expanded their light-rail and commuter-rail systems, while some have built bus rapid-transit lines. Many of these new services provide airport connections, including ones that serve Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International. The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, for instance, has been linked since 2000 by the Trinity Railway Express to the center of Dallas (35-minute ride, $4.50 each way), and since 2002 to Fort Worth (31 minutes, $2.50 each way). The Trinity trains run about twice an hour during peak commuting times in the morning and afternoon, and hourly at other times. The airport station can be reached by a shuttle bus from all terminals. Information is available at trinityrailwayexpress.org/newweekeb.html. Figuring out whether rapid transit works for you should take about five minutes on the Internet. Use the search term “ground transportation” and the airport you are visiting. All major airport Web sites publish instructions with maps about how to get to train stations. The sites also link to the local public-transit agency that operates the service and provide details about routes, schedules and fares. If you are carrying a lot of bags, a shuttle bus, taxi or rental car generally makes more sense even though they cost more than trains. During morning and afternoon rush hours, these more conventional methods can also take considerably longer. But if you are carrying only an overnight bag, a laptop and a briefcase, the train is competitive. Here are six cities that make the transit connection convenient. Boston Logan International Airport has two rapid transit lines to get downtown and to many suburbs, a rapid-transit bus line and a subway. Two years ago, the airport and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority opened the Silver Line rapid-transit bus service on a dedicated right of way from Logan to South Station downtown, which connects to commuter rail, Amtrak, intercity bus service and the Red Line subway to Cambridge and other communities. The bus stops three times in the city, serves all five Logan terminals, costs $1.25 a ride and takes about 20 minutes. A taxi takes much longer during rush hours and costs $25 to $30. Logan is also served by the Blue Line subway, reachable on a free shuttle bus that runs regularly all day and serves every terminal. The Blue Line intersects the Orange Line at the State Street station (three stops) and the Green Line at Government Center (four stops). The one-way fare is $2, and travelers typically can make the total trip, airplane to city destination, in 40 minutes to an hour, better than contending with Boston traffic, especially at peak times. For more information, go to mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/. PhiladelphiaThe Philadelphia International Airport is served by a commuter-rail line that connects all seven terminals to center city. Since the service started in 1985, 20 million passengers have used the R1 high-speed train to get to and from the airport. Trains run every 30 minutes from 5 a.m. to midnight, and take about 20 to 30 minutes to reach three downtown stations that connect with Amtrak and Philadelphia’s extensive subway and commuter-rail system. The one-way fare is $7 or $8 on the train (a taxi costs about $30), and tickets may be bought from the conductor. Additional information is at septa.org/service/sched/pdfs/R1Airport.pdf. Chicago The Chicago Transit Authority operates the Blue Line subway 24 hours a day from O’Hare International Airport to downtown Chicago. The authority also operates the Orange Line to Midway Airport. One drawback to taking the train to the city from O’Hare is that the Blue Line station is tricky to find. Follow the signs to the O’Hare C.T.A. station, which is on the lowest level of the parking garage in the main terminal area. One advantage, however, of taking the train from O’Hare is that it runs every 10 minutes during the day, and takes around 45 minutes. The Orange Line station at Midway is a 10-minute walk from the main terminal. Trains operate 21 hours a day during the week, every six to eight minutes during peak times, and take about 30 minutes to make the 121/2-mile trip downtown. The fare from O’Hare and Midway is $2 each way and could climb at peak times pending budget negotiations. Average taxi fare from O’Hare to downtown is $35 to $40, and from Midway $25 to $30. The Web site for the Blue Line is transitchicago.com/maps/rail/blue/OHare.pdf. For the Orange Line, transitchicago.com/maps/rail/orange/Midway.pdf. San FranciscoThe Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system has been serving San Francisco International Airport since June 2003 with fast, frequent trains. BART trains stop at a station in Garage G, which is reachable on the airport’s AirTrain system, an automated people mover that connects terminals with airport services. Its trains run all day, as often as every four minutes. BART operates from the airport from 4 a.m. to nearly midnight during the week. It takes 23 to 33 minutes to reach all San Francisco stations, which connect to four other lines and 37 more stations in the 104-mile system. One-way fares vary by destination, though they are generally in the $5 range. For schedules and a BART map, see bart.gov/stations/schedules/lineSchedules.asp. For fares, bart.gov/tickets/calculator/fareCalculator.asp. WashingtonRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, which lies just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington, is served by the Blue and Yellow Lines of the city’s Metrorail, one of the most modern and elegant rapid-transit systems in the world. Trains operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority run every few minutes from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., and to 3:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The 106-mile, 86-station Metro system serves Washington and Virginia and Maryland suburbs. The trip from Reagan National to downtown on the Yellow Line, which is more direct, takes 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your stop. There is no faster way to get downtown. On the Blue Line, which serves more stations on the Virginia side of the river, trips downtown can take 15 to 24 minutes. Fares to center-city stations vary, but are generally around $2 each way. Tickets can be bought at dedicated vending machines at the airport Metro station, in front of the main terminal. The Web site for the Metro’s map is wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm. For schedules, wmata.com/timetables/rail/Midday.pdf. MinneapolisThe Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is connected to downtown Minneapolis by the Hiawatha light-rail line. Trains run every 10 minutes during much of the day. The trip takes 25 minutes and costs $2 each way. Trams connect passengers to light-rail stations at two airport terminals, though this year one of the Hiawatha Light Rail stations is closed for construction at the Humphrey Terminal.

2007-09-17,‘The Indian Clerk’," The man sitting next to the podium appeared to be very old, at least in the eyes of the members of his audience, most of whom were very young. In fact he was not yet sixty. The curse of men who look younger than they are, Hardy often thought, is that at some moment in their lives they cross a line and start to look older than they are. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, he had regularly been mistaken for a schoolboy up for a visit. As a don, he had regularly been mistaken for an undergraduate. Now age had caught up with him and then outrun him, and he seemed the very embodiment of the elderly mathematician whom progress has left behind. ""Mathematics is a young man's game""-he himself would write these words in a few years time-and he had had a better run of it than most. Ramanujan had died at thirty-three. These days admirers smitten with Ramanujan's legend speculated as to what he might have achieved had he lived longer, but it was Hardy's private opinion that he wouldn't have achieved much. He had died with his best work behind him. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/chapters/0916-1st-leav.html

Bloomberg has preached a doctrine of fiscal responsibility, but he has been presiding over one of the greatest expansions of city government since the John V. Lindsay administration, fueled by an extraordinary surge in real estate revenues, Diane Cardwell reports in a front-page article. The Times reviewed city data going back to 1980 and found that the city budget, adjusted for inflation, has grown by 23 percent, to $60 billion, since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, compared with 8 percent during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s eight years; 4 percent under Mayor David N. Dinkins’s four years; and 19 percent during the last two terms of Mayor Edward I. Koch.About 75 percent of the growth under Mr. Bloomberg has been driven by expenses that are difficult to control, like employee health care costs and benefits, pension payments and Medicaid. Even so, Mr. Bloomberg has increased spending on controllable expenses, like parks, information technology and schools. The number of city workers has declined by about 1 percent since Mr. Bloomberg took office, but he has been increasing the staff of late. Mr. Bloomberg’s aides argued that their approach has been restrained and that the mayor’s investment in services has helped the city thrive.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/morning-buzz-growth-in-city-spending-attorney-general-nominee-refurbished-monument-and-more/

George E. Pataki led the deregulation push, in which most of the state utilities, including Consolidated Edison, sold their power plants to independent companies, then brought power on unregulated wholesale markets. But instead of lower prices, New Yorkers have faced increases far larger than consumers in states that kept their power industries regulated, according to a study by Marilyn Showalter of Power in the Public Interest, which oppose energy deregulation.

2007-09-20,X-Rated Baseball Glove,"The recent uproar over stealing signals reminded us that more pitchers seem to be holding their glove in front of their face when talking to their teammates or manager -- presumably to prevent adept lip readers on opposing teams from gathering information.

The Yankees’ Andy Pettitte becomes almost completely faceless -- except for a pair of peering eyes -- when he lifts his glove up toward his pulled-down cap. But using the glove as a shield apparently has other purposes, too. The Times’s Tyler Kepner tells us that former Yankee Scott Proctor performed this action more than anyone he can remember -- and it turns out the lip reader he feared the most was his wife. It seems Proctor’s wife didn’t like seeing him spew obscenities on the mound when he pitched poorly. So he reflexively put his glove in front of his mouth to hide his expletives, and then just kept doing it. And if you remember Proctor’s early struggles with New York, it’s easy to understand why his words weren’t family-friendly.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/sports/playemail/0920playglove.html

Now I finally feel that I’m fully integrated into the civilian world and I’m getting increasingly comfortable with my new surroundings.

2007-09-21,Quad Q&A: Memories of a Tiger,"Today’s Q&A subject on The Quad is the writer John Ed Bradley. A novelist and a longtime contributor to Sports Illustrated, as well as publications such as Esquire and GQ, Bradley is also a former center for the Louisiana State football team. When his playing days ended in 1979, Bradley moved on, so much so that he lost contact with most of his former teammates and coaches. The thought of no longer being able to play football, and perhaps having the best years of his life already behind him at such a young age, was haunting. Bradley first publicly addressed those feelings in a widely praised 2002 Sports Illustrated essay. He has just released a memoir called “It Never Rains In Tiger Stadium,” which expands on the essay. Bradley, who lives on the same street that he grew up on in Opelousas, La., spoke to us about how football is like a great love affair, appreciating his former teammates and coaches, and realizing that Hemingway didn’t know anything about the SEC.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/quad-qa-memories-of-a-tiger/

2007-09-21,Istanbul — Travel Basics,"AIRPORTS: Most visitors’ first glimpse of Turkey will take place as they fly over the sprawl of Istanbul’s seemingly endless apartment blocks and neighborhoods dotted with mosques before landing at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. Named for the founder of the modern Turkish republic, this modern facility is pretty easy to negotiate upon arrival. Many Westerners needing a visa can buy one at the airport, just prior to going through passport control. (Be sure to check in your home country first!) It’s a short walk to the baggage carousels and the duty free shops. If you have friends who live in town, ask them before hand if you can pick something up here for them: alcohol, perfumes and, yes, the ever popular cigarettes, are much cheaper here. One annoyance is that the luggage carts are not free of charge as they are in many European airports. Who has Turkish lira coins at this point? Once you have your bags and your duty free treats, proceed to the exit. Yes, there is a customs desk, but controls are few and far between. Once in the main concourse, you will find ATMs for getting local currency and even a Starbucks and a Gloria Jeans in case you just simply cannot wait for a dose of caffeine. Please note that departing passengers really do need to get here 2 hours before their flights. The lines can be mind-bogglingly long, there are several checkpoints before reaching your plane and the shopping opportunities get better on your way to the gate.",Travel,https://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/istanbul-travel-basics/

In the Arctic, the man was disgusted to encounter uninhibited Eskimo women coupling lustily with their husbands. Watching one of them in flagrante, he thought nostalgically of his seemly spouse and doubted whether the Eskimo wife even deserved the name of woman. But while he was off finding the True North, his wife was undertaking her own journey of discovery, setting her sensuality aflame with the teachings of Emma Goldman. Upon the explorer’s return, he sensed with alarm that the orbit of his “moral planet” had shifted. In their marital bed, his wife was “not as vigorously modest as she’d been.” To him, her liberation felt like a punishment from God. But what did it feel like to her?

This is despite Clarke’s lovely descriptions of houses as they burn, baby, burn: “There is plenty that is beautiful about a house burning hot and high in the dark, cold night: the way flames shoot out of the chimney like a Roman candle; the way the asphalt roof shingles sizzle and pop; the way the smoke pours and pours and pours heavenward like a message to the house’s great beyond.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/Bowman-t.html

The four more liberal justices were often moved to dissent in unusually personal and vehement terms. “It is my firm conviction,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the case striking down race-based enrollment policies in public schools, “that no Member of the Court that I joined in 1975 would have agreed with today’s decision.” According to the gossip among Supreme Court law clerks, the level of tension among the justices is higher than at any point since Bush v.

It was the second-to-last day of shooting on “Funny Games,” Haneke’s first English-language feature, and the mood on set was approaching mutiny. A seemingly straightforward sequence of shots had become bogged down in technical concerns, and the word was that no additional studio time would be forthcoming. After 12 hours of nearly continuous work, the crew looked glassy-eyed and resentful, especially those among them — hair and makeup, production assistants and grips — whose job at that moment consisted mainly of standing around. Adding to the frustration were the multiple language barriers on set: the crew was American, the cameraman French and the director himself, with his elegant black suit and air of patrician reserve, as Austrian as Austrian can be. Only the children, the actor Devon Gearhart and his stand-in, Gregory Clifton, seemed motivated and eager to please. But by law, the child actors couldn’t work past 10 that night, and 10 was getting closer all the time.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23haneke-t.html

2007-09-24,Inside the List,"KARMA AND DOGMA: Two new entries climb to the top of the hardcover nonfiction list: Bill Clinton’s “Giving” and a dark book of letters from Mother Teresa called “Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light.” (These chronicle the nearly five decades she says she spent without sensing the presence of God.) Both Clinton and Mother Teresa have been the subjects of brutal books by Christopher Hitchens, whose own current best seller, “God Is Not Great,” lingers on the list at No. 11. Newsweek, provocatively, asked Hitchens — who testified, at the invitation of the Vatican, against Mother Teresa’s beatification and canonization — to review “Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light.” He called her dark nights of the soul “the inevitable result of a dogma that asks people to believe impossible things and then makes them feel abject and guilty when their innate reason rebels.” His concluding sentence: “I say it as calmly as I can — the church should have had the elementary decency to let the earth lie lightly on this troubled and miserable lady, and not to invoke her long anguish to recruit the credulous to a blind faith in which she herself had long ceased to believe.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/23tbr.html

At a time when the average young-adult novel was, in Hinton’s characterization, “Mary Jane went to the prom,” “The Outsiders” shocked readers with its frank depictions of adolescents smoking, drinking and “rumbling.” Although other pop culture offerings had dealt with these themes — most notably “Rebel Without a Cause” and “West Side Story” — their intended audience was adult. By contrast, “The Outsiders” was a story “for teenagers, about teenagers, written by a teenager.” Hinton’s candid, canny appraisal of the conflict between Socs, or Socials, and Greasers (for which one might substitute Jets and Sharks), published when she was 17, was an immediate hit and remains the best-selling young-adult novel of all time.

My politics are actually quite moderate. (Most real lefties, in fact, think I'm a Washington establishment sellout.)

When people ask me, as they do all the time, if I'm writing something and what I'm writing, I get mildly annoyed and I say that I've already written enough in my life, certainly more than most of my fellow citizens, and that writing isn't a duty one can perform on demand.

What course of action should the United States pursue in Iraq? What is the best response to the crisis in Darfur, Iran's nuclear ambitions, Russia's hostility to NATO, and China's rising power? How should the United States address global warming, combat terrorism, and reverse the erosion of its international image?

Perlstein claims that the college experience “has begun to disappear,” that “[college] as America used to understand it is coming to end,” but doesn’t acknowledge the other side of the equation. He mentions the Internet only briefly in the essay, but the topic is in dire need of further exploration. “College,” as Perlstein considers the subject, has disappeared because the energy that fueled it has found a new outlet via technology. This new center for communication, information, and power has certainly redirected the energy of the social conscience on campus, but to best understand the shift, one first has to look at some of the historical currents that have shaped the last half-century.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/whats-the-matter-with-old-people/

Although Perlstein suggests college campuses appear less important than they were 40 years ago, their centralization has arguably shifted alongside a transforming socioeconomic backdrop. Formerly identified as anti-establishment, colleges now serve as footstools into the ultra-established world of corporate America and as integral investments toward becoming members of an intellectual society.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/a-matter-of-establishment/

Mr. Kennedy includes in his eulogy a section of one of his brother’s speeches that so correctly characterizes a feeling of inevitable change that to read it now is disappointing:",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-monkey-off-our-back/
2007-09-24,College: The Ticket to the Good Life?,"“Knowledge itself is power,” was written over 400 years ago by Francis Bacon, an English philosopher. I have been told this same statement since I was six years old, whether from a teacher, my parents, or a public service announcement on television. Knowledge certainly is power, and the more you know, the further in life you can go. But it simply is not this simple anymore. The knowledge of today needs to be backed up by a degree or two from a well-known and respected institution. Knowledge for knowledge’s sake is wonderful, but knowledge with a B.A., B.S., J.D., M.B.A., or Ph.D. behind it is more likely to pay the bills and obtain status. Bacon went to college for two years, joined the staff of England’s ambassador to France, and went on to become a Member of Parliament. That was then. This is now; two years in college may get you a low-paying, low-prestige career, but certainly not one close to the likes of Parliament.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-the-ticket-to-the-good-life/

As a current university student, I cannot dispute his allegations and this should be nosurprise. It is important however, that we all understand the reasons for this change between the generations. I believe there are three overarching explinations for this; first, we live in an increasingly isolated society, second, college is no longer a unique experience, and third, the out of control costs of auniversity education.

Perlstein specifically addresses the climate of college in the 1960s and 1970s. By contrasting the ways in which students interacted and joined in the public debate in those decades with what he sees as indifference from many modern college students, Perlstein presents a view of contemporary campus life as a wasteland of moderation caused by the system’s infantilizing of today’s students and rampant commercialization of the college experience. Plainly, as universities seek to broaden their appeal and reap financial benefits from the intellectual property they sow, American culture suffers.

2007-09-24,Why College Matters; Accomodating Movement into the Future,"My university’s most recent unspoken motto; “access to excellence”, has morphed radically from what it must have meant during Rick Perlstein’s college era. Access, something that used to be seen as an opportunity for those who deserved it, has morphed into an opportunity for any who reach for it, fund it, or debt themselves into it. Excellence, something once interpreted as the expectation of a graduate not only articulate and well rounded, but also a competent and ethical, has become defined as prepared professionals ignorant of how to move beyond textbook knowledge. This has led to the growth of my university- Temple, an institution geared towards the blue collared population of America, but it also represents a change in the mindset of the American public. Suddenly the American public wants everyone to be the ‘best’ and the ‘brightest’ while ignoring that both of those adjectives address a minority, and cannot encompass a nation that is comparing its own population to itself.

2007-09-24,The Cultural Contradictions of American Universities,"For the past twenty to thirty years, we have seen the great degradation of post-secondary education. Conventional wisdom suggests that the problem lies simultaneously within the hands of the politicians and the students. This narrative does not account for the history of college. Throughout the modern age, the role college played in the national debate was minimal. To this date, there has only been one president with a Ph.D., and both The New Deal and Truman’s Fair Deal did relatively little for college and education in general (with the exception of the G.I. Bill). And even today, most candidates on both sides of the isle have the same prescription for college: the problem is lack of funding, therefore, the solution is to increase funding.

Let’s all look at the picture here (not just glance, but really look at it). Young adults in general don’t read, are addicted to mass media, and are lazy. This new generation, which I shall call Generation Z (after what they catch), is an easy target for the reason why colleges aren’t the same as they used to be. I can imagine it now: an aged hippie or, better (worse?) yet, a beatnik, reminiscing about the good old days, when “we had the motivation to change the world, by dinghy!”, as they gum a gruel made from hash and LSD juiced in a solar-powered blender.

My politics, like his, are left of center. Yet his article repelled me. He speaks of his “radical, alienated friends,” the unhappier subjects of his interviews, as if the mere fact that they are not “organization kids” makes them the right kind of college student. Speaking of interviewing a happy student, he remarks, “I ask her if many of her fellow students, as many young people did in the 1960’s, feel alienated from society.” He is disappointed when she answers in the negative. It seems that he would like to have the rest of us engage in hating our institutions and society at large because it is better to be alienated, because that is what going to college is all about and because being alienated is the prerequisite for making change.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-20/

My memories of shopping period generally include rising at an ambiguously-houred portion of the early afternoon, playing a lot of Frisbee, attending multiple themed reunion parties, getting reacquainted with dining hall food, taking more trips to Boston than I will for the rest of the semester, and generally refining my skills at loafing and leisure with the best company I can find.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/camp-harvard/

Twenty of us would gather around midnight, with Mountain Dew and cigarettes, arguing passionately about cultural oppression, the death penalty, and alternative rock bands.

2007-09-24,My Father and the Game of Baseball,"My Dad, a Brooklyn Dodgers fan from the start used to attend games in regularity with his Norwegian neighborhood friends, way in the back, high up in the stands, popping peanuts into mouths that were busy shouting at the umpires and error happy ball players. Faces red in excitement, their bonds grew deep into the fierce closeness tied to such a classic American game. It took a scorching summer evening at a Philadelphia Phillies game for me to finally understand my father and his love for baseball. Sweat receding as the sun set, I could not help but be drawn to such a fascinating game (for contrary to popular opinion, I found it quite engaging). However, the joy and progression of the baseball game was soon overshadowed by the suffocating commercialism and false countenance that filled the stadium. Glancing around I noticed the American stereotype in all it’s glory: Chase Utley jerseys so snug around big bellies, empty cups of steak flavored slushies strewn about, and somehow an overabundance of cell phone users discussing important business in the middle of the fourth inning. Dolefully, I was overwhelmed by such an oblivion to the beautifully graceful sport that was being played there in the lights. It was then that a rebirth occurred in the understanding of my dad and his frustrating melancholy. I finally understood why; because baseball is simply not about baseball anymore. In fact, my father and I are not so far apart in our frustrations with the world for when people ask me, “why are you not return to school in the fall?” I explain, how college is not about knowledge anymore.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/my-father-and-the-game-of-baseball/

2007-09-24,The Kids are Too All Right The Homogenization of Youth and the College Experience: A response to Rick Perlstein’s essay “What’s the matter with College”,"If we were to examine the mechanisms of college today, we would find the framework of these institutions to be startlingly similar to those of a factory. I recently received my undergraduate degree from Eugene Lang, the undergraduate Liberal Arts division of New School University. The New School University is an appropriate place to examine the streamlining of the “college experience”. My mother’s college experience took place during the golden age of campus activism, the 1960’s. Regardless, she finished her undergraduate degree in less than three years, for she did not have the time or financial opportunities to enjoy the frontier of American lifestyles as reminisced in Rick Perlstein’s essay. Her only “radical” act was wearing jeans to school.. Yet, when it came time for her son to start applying to college, she was awash in nostalgia. For my mother, who didn’t have the privilege to live on a college campus or take part in any extra-curricular activities, a reminder of these years still exuded a sense of nervous excitement. Herein lies the defining characteristic of my generation: there is no more excitement, because there is no more danger in the college experience; no more lust for danger. By “danger”, I do not infer acts of violence. By danger, I mean the uncertainty entangled with the new- the mystery in experiencing the never before.

My former housemate, Ryan, walked me through their rented summer house, pointing out his latest textile endeavors and giving me the highs and lows of his graphic design internship. One friend rushed over to the house, still grungy and sweaty from an early morning job tracking common yellowthroats for a Skidmore ornithology professor. I only got a brief hello from two friends clomping out the door in muddy hiking boots, headed for Lake George. I met Cora, a fellow social work major, for lunch and heard her intense stories from working at a camp for children with terminal illnesses.

In many ways Perlstein is right: college is actually no longer what it once was, the number of schools has increased, the amounts of students attending has increased, drop outs have increased, and tuition has increased. Colleges may be changing all over the country in countless ways, but the reason college matters remains unchanged. The underlying reason for college’s existence is to help the individual to become who he or she wants to be, even though schools may not always appear to enable students to reach their dreams. Today, college appears like a party with 20,000 kids all alike, or it appears as a chance to meet a mate, or it appears like a place to go for four years and get piece of paper somehow making you more employable. But it is far more than what it appears to be today as Perlstein has overlooked. Regardless of the face college takes today, the basis for college has never changed from the day it appeared here in America.

On the other, employers and grad schools have encouraged students to pursue internships and gain “real world” experience far earlier than they used to. Indeed, the two ends of the barrel are now converging. As Kay S.

Quite simply, the college experience as our parents knew it has become obsolete. As Perlstein hints, the internet has replaced college as the main way to find out about “taboo” subjects. College students don’t need to go to college anymore to expand their cultural awareness–they can do so in their bedrooms at a lower cost (after all, surfing the Net doesn’t cost one thousands of dollars a semester). The “generation gap” as the boomers define it, has also changed. A generation ago, your parents were your parents; they saw their job as parenting, disciplining, and the like. Thus, this provided ample ground for generation gap confrontations. You went to college, and experienced things your parents didn’t let you see, do things your parents didn’t let you do. But somewhere along the line parents stopped being parents–they became friends, providers. When you have been provided for, your every whim indulged, why rebel against your parents. Our generation doesn’t hate our parents, and we don’t want to; our generation doesn’t want to rebel. We’re busy wrapped up in our own little lives, which have been cultivated by our parents.

Should the protest be suspended over night? Would the sit-out carry through the weekend? A resolution came more quickly than anyone anticipated: by late afternoon the Dean of Students announced that the President, George Campbell, who had earlier made a reluctant and sheepish appeal to the crowd of students, agreed to meet the demands of the protest. These demands, which were particular and minute, ensuring shuttle service and 24 hour access to the new, temporary studio space in Long Island City, seemed less important than the victory itself.

It all just depends on who you ask and his/her upbringing. One must also keep in mind that college in itself is not a liberty freely given to everyone in society as a whole. Instead of asking What’s The Matter With College, we should be asking what’s the matter with society? A society that’s so caught up in itself that it fails to see the bigger picture, not to stray away from the original question but to shed light on the bigger problem. College or universities were institutions designed to nurture creative thought and thinking to insure success in an ever changing world. To give birth to the brightest minds, intellects, and entrepreneurs. What purpose does college truly serve today, how are college grads bringing about overall change, what drives a individual to pursue a degree and how is his/her degree utilized to bring about change.

2007-09-24,What’s the Matter with College?: A Perspective from a New Generation.,"I was born in a country where college does not exist. There is no period of separation from home and intense interaction with peers, no encouraged period of individual growth, both intellectual and emotional. Instead, immediately after high school, Russian teens choose their professions and attend graduate or technical school. Most assume adult responsibilities like marriage and family early in life, at least earlier than comparable young adults in the United States. This happens not only because of economics or similar causes, but also because of a social belief system very different from that of the United States, one in which college — both as a reflection of and an influence on society – is nonexistent. America is nearly unique it its dedication of this time of personal growth in the life of a young adult, and the role college plays in our society – even as different generations pass through it — cannot be underestimated. I therefore have to disagree with Mr. Perlstein and argue that college has never been more critical to the American nation.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/whats-the-matter-with-college-a-perspective-from-a-new-generation/

College meant getting away from all that I had managed to avoid during high school, it meant getting out of the world where me being antisocial was the only thing that would inspire me to write some decent lines upon processed bark. College was freedom, freedom from constraints: freedom to read and discuss Nietzsche with other intellects, freedom to live a life lacking any “adult” responsibilities, freedom to branch out and meet people I actually wanted to meet and be friends with. That was the definition of college I believed in, until it was time to decide where I wanted to go. As I read more about college life, and as I discussed the reasons as to why even bother spending such a long time in an institution, I realized that college was the path that led to living the life of a “normal” person who contributes money and time to society and who believes in the altruistic, humanistic approach to life.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-end/

We quickly found that the professors aren’t reactionary at all – quite the opposite, honestly. We looked for something local we could fix, but found nothing new. There is no pressing Civil Rights battle on our campuses, there is no obvious sexual segregation.

Look around, in the least academic of settings. “College” is a section at Target or Bed, Bath, and Beyond. It may well be the entire Container Store. I am a college student, and I have loved college, yet I often feel that “college” is a notion of little use, and of even less coherence. Let me be clear: my college experience has been life-changing and eye-opening, humbling, empowering, invigorating, and exhausting. But I am not sure that I have had the real “college” experience. I don’t know what that would be. Periodically, this realization has troubled me. Now a rising Senior, I have often paused to consider whether my college experience has been everything “college” might entail, imply or even demand. I have learned to dismiss these questions as unanswerable and irrelevant; I have rejected them for the same reason I dispute Rick Perlstein’s assertion that “college” is disappearing: the very premise is wrong. “College,” posited as a coherent theoretical and practical institution, as an entity consistent in valence and meaning, has never existed. “College” may indeed be disappearing, but it is only a fading mirage.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/whats-the-matter-with-college-college-is/

The social movements across college campuses in the 1960s are now legendary.

2007-09-24,Why College Matters,"Until a few years ago, I would have argued with anyone who insisted that a college education was essential. Even now I would argue that a college degree is no more than a congratulatory rubber stamp on the completion of four years at any given institution. But a college degree and a college education are not necessarily one and the same. As an 18 year old entering college, one has already completed 12 continuous years of schooling. He or she is not looking at college in terms of education for education’s sake, but rather for what other opportunities, e.g. Social, athletic, or career, might present themselves. That and a small piece of paper which indicates that you are now “educated” and competent enough to join the work force is the primary focus. This is no different today than it was 32 years ago, when I first entered college. What is different is the level of sophistication that accompanies a college freshman. Gone is the wide-eyed wonder and blatant innocence worn by the matriculating student of the 60’s and 70’s. Then, for many, it was the first time away from home and the only connection to the familiar was Ma Bell or the US Postal Service. College became home, and friends became family.

2007-09-24,Lessons from a Conservative Campus,"The sixties’ college experience was my generation’s favorite bedtime story. But like all the best tales we tell ourselves, this one too went the way of the tooth fairy. In his What’s the Matter with College, Rick Perlstein examines the modern phenomenon of the College Campus that Couldn’t, wondering how it devolved from its sixties counterpart, a magical realm that kindled its students’ intellectual fires and replaced all the world’s answers with questions. Today, he reports, college life is a choice between organization and alienation. College without criticism falls short of being critical; and when campus no longer leads the culture, college as we know it is coming to an end. But if college was college before Perlstein was there, collegians once learned not to question society’s values but to uphold them. Whether it translates to a hippie’s dream or a hipster’s nightmare, college is still society, caricatured: the sixties were a liberating time for everyone involved, not just the freshmen, and if college then inculcated an era-appropriate dose of dissent, college these days does just as good a job raising respect for the establishment. It’s the very stillness of true conservatism that allows its impact to slide by unnoticed, and so while Perlstein is right to note today’s collegiate sea change, I don’t see the level of questioning he hearkens to occurring anywhere, whether on campus or off. No wonder the celebration of universities has quieted since the hippies’ heyday; today’s political climate holds its dissidents and intellectuals at bay.

Blame it on the rap music, MTV, BET, VHI, and video games for the lack of activism from the college students.

Now that higher education has become directly linked with a fatter paycheck, and money is becoming synonymous with happiness, America is losing its grasp on what college is supposed to be.

Are we – “the modern student” – ashamed to be as active as our predecessors were, unwilling to take a stand for substantial issues not specifically the ones that affect us personally, but issues that indirectly concern us locally and globally?

2007-09-24,It’s the Morning After in America,"Looking back on my four years at UC Berkeley, I wonder if it is the same university it was forty years ago. Certainly the protests are smaller, more sparsely attended, and the speakers less fiery. Buildings are not occupied, and though you can still find a copy of The Socialist Worker without much effort, not many students are moved to read it. The presence of industry is everywhere apparent, not just in corporate sponsorships, but in cooperative research and development of technology. Mr. Perlstein is certainly right that market thinking has scaled the walls that once guarded the ivory tower. In this sense, the dividing line between the ideals of the university and the cold calculations of business has certainly been crossed enough times to make it seem a relic of another era.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/its-the-morning-after-in-america/

There were no episodes of frantic cramming or practice tests; there was only Zach’s annoyance that he was stuck in school on a Saturday morning to take it. It’s a good thing I didn’t build my perception of the test from that first impression, because as I would come to discover over the next few years, the SATs are a small slice of my generation’s neuroticism over college and ultimately, over our future.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/job-skills-not-life-skills/
2007-09-24,The Common Ground,"Rick Perlstein is right; college has changed. It no longer resembles the images of 1960’s university life he recalls in his essay. We do not have celebrities crashing in our dorm rooms, or if we do, they are of the reality-tv rather than the revolutionary variety. To modern high-school graduates, college does not offer much in the way of new ideas or new philosophies. No one I know has ever discovered themselves in their first reading of a banned book.

2007-09-24,College Grows Up: The Changing Face of the American University,"I suspect that to the incoming college student, there are few phrases more ominous than the thought that “college as America used to understand it is coming to an end.” College, after all, is the end to which we have devoted our thoughts and directed our studies toward over the last four years. More importantly, it represents to us the next four years to come. For the class of 2007, the pipe dream of college has not yet dissolved into the quotidian banality of small dorms and stressful classes. For us – and perhaps, only us – the undergraduate experience remains nebulous and glimmering. Unburdened by reality, it still seems fraught with the possibilities tangibly encapsulated in hastily-purchased school sweatshirts and an acceptance letter, heavily creased from being read too many times.

2007-09-24,Why College Still Matters,"The college experience and the students who lived it undeniably played a colorful and visible role in the national dialogue during the 1960s, yet student protesters, especially those that used destructive tactics, seldom played a central role in influencing public policy or popular opinion. With historian Rick Perlstein’s description of the colleges as a harbor for alienated students and revolutionary thought, the question becomes whether the campus -“its own ‘city state'” and “a place radically apart from the rest of society”– was as central to the nation as Perlstein asserts. But by intentionally distinguishing themselves from the nation, college activists often traded pragmatism and centrality for symbolism and flare.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-still-matters-3/

I’m one of 18 million students enrolled in over 4200 colleges. I have a feeling, though, that he’s not talking about the 46% of college students who are enrolled in community colleges. He’s talking about an alienated suburban kid’s paradise, not an industrious inner city kid’s escape from the streets, a first- generation kid’s new frontier, or a fresh start for parents who hadn’t gone to college “back when it was college.”",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/redefining-the-revolution/
2007-09-24,What College Can Offer,"More and more, college is becoming a necessary rite of passage for young men and women to work toward reaching their goals in life- to land that dream career, to earn money, to achieve a successful and fulfilling life. College has become so ingrained in our society, we expect everyone to go or to have gone. Many jobs require that the applicant have a degree in their particular field. Thus, in order to get that perfect job, college is a must. And it’s not just about the career. College has become an indication of status. We express more interest in and tend to think higher of those who have gone to the ivy leagues than those who have gone to community college. Those who didn’t even go to college we place at the bottom of the social ladder. True, there have been cases of people who have gone on to become successful and highly admired in our society (Steve Jobs, a college dropout, comes to mind). However, these are the exceptional few, whose talents and skills have surpassed the need for college. The majority of us, however, need college to reach our goals.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/what-college-can-offer/
2007-09-24,College Really Is Not What It Once Was!!!!,"Why does college matter? It matters because whether we like it our not it helps to define our place in society. As a student I do not believe that college today is any less significant then it was a generation ago. I do however believe that the role college plays in our lives is much different than it was in years prior. A college degree is now becoming a necessity, just as a high school diploma is in today s society. In order to even be considered for what society may consider to be a good job, a college degree is required.

2007-09-24,College in its Evolution,"As a first generation college student I cannot identify with Mr. Perlstein’s idea of what college used to be like; neither my parents nor my grandparents have stories to tell me about their college years. However, I feel obligated to shed some light as to why Mr. Perlstein’s romanticized idea of what college should be like is not possible for every student. The period of self expression and experimentation of ideas during four years between the ages of 18 and 22 is a fairytale scenario for the masses. This blissful journey through college where students have time to read books like Measure for Measure in dorm common rooms and have intellectual discussions of what Shakespeare’s true message was, is not for everyone. Yes, college today is connected with real world issues and students study boring topics (to some) like business. College being practical should not be a novel concept. With the price of higher education today, parents only hope that their children are learning up to date education and not skipping class to discuss classic works of fiction. Immigrant parents, at least mine, are forever advising their children to work hard and obtain a degree that will secure a job after college. I could never dream of studying music, dance or theatre because to my parents, those careers are merely hobbies. I was meant to “be a lawyer, a doctor or a diplomat!” my mother always said. College has evolved. It is becoming an integrated learning experience and not the intellectual safe-haven it used to be.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-in-its-evolution/
2007-09-24,The Problem with College: Why We No Longer See Ourselves As “Part of” a Community,"One anomaly of American society is that our universities play only a marginal role in our culture. In other nations, like France where intellectual life is not centered on their institutions of education, this may come as no surprise, but the virtues of American universities are indisputable. Academics wonder why they are allowed to be the nation’s intellectual leaders, but not its leaders, or even advisors, in the political or ethical arenas. Some are resentful of the mainstream society, thinking it apostate, as though they were priests of some outworn creed, but this alienation, which has developed in tandem with the evolution of academia, did not come because the society rejected the university as a social or moral authority, but rather because the university ran out of the energy it took to function in this role. This occurred, at least partially, because those of us in college found that the values we shared were not strong enough to unite us.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-problem-with-college-why-we-no-longer-see-ourselves-as-part-of-a-community/

I was appalled at the idea that these young men and women who traversed four years or more of college were updating a country agog as to which of two men had secured his bank account. This isn’t news, I thought. Who would ever find this exciting?

College is less of a national and cultural landmark as it is a necessity and emblem of prestige. More and more students are applying to and attending college today, not because they lust after the new life and independence it will offer, but because it is an obligatory prerequisite for careers. Competition for acceptance into the most prestigious colleges has increased, not because the enlightening landscape these schools offer, but because it is a vehicle for one day acquiring a dream, and for the recognition itself. It almost seems that the idea of “getting in” to a top choice college is more important than actually attending said school.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/replicating-the-college-revolution/

But it doesn’t mean that to me. I wanted one at sixteen, but now, now I know better. My generation is less and less enamored with the steely shine of these fuel hungry beasts.

Obviously in many decades that have come by, the “bone of contention in elections have differed.” I do not think it is peculiar this time around.” Maybe the college experience is less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago.

One need not enter a Kaplan Center to find a generation primed to stay within the standardized test’s proverbial Scantron bubble, solving for X but not solving any problems. Stepford-esque pre-professional fervor burns rampant in the hearts of today’s co-eds as bachelor’s degrees become less valuable than the paper they are printed on. Even conservative pundit Michelle Malkin was on to something when she deemed the politically-correct university establishment as a “coddle industry” designed to stifle rather than engage intellectual discourse. In this decade of slack-jawed complacency, where even Malkin is a voice of reason about the institution, the fate of college as we know it looks grim.

2007-09-24,True College Expectation: Education and Integrity,"Henry Adams at the turn of the last century wrote that if college had encouraged the integrity of character needed to succeed in life, “it would have been education better worth having than mathematics or languages; but so far as it helped to make anything, it helped only to make the college standard permanent through life.” This from a man who graduated as the Class Orator from Harvard; he got a very good education. What was missing from it is again missing today. Adams was alluding to the “negative force” of American college education: the damage of having no education in how to think independently or know oneself, instead jumping miles of purely intellectual hurdles. After bounding them all with as few blunders as possible, the student stands on the other side of the BA or BS cue; and then isn’t trained to decide for himself what the best career is: he gets into a new line of pre-set jumps that his friend, or father, or other source recommended, that will extend in the future far enough.

Dozens of students wrote irate emails to school administrators to find out just how the school intended to fix this. Some even threatened to transfer.

I was a clean slate. I expected to encounter neither activism nor passion in others; I wanted neither conformity nor an established brand of uniqueness for myself. It was my deepest wish to exist freely without interference. Surrounded by those thoughts, I slowly breathed in my first gulp of air without friends or family by my side and felt a long-awaited relief flood my faculties. This was freedom.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/no-title-3/
2007-09-24,(no title),"In order to ask “What’s the Matter with College?” as Mr. Perlstein does in his essay, one must acknowledge that there is indeed a problem. But is there actually something “wrong” with college as it exists today? I personally cannot answer that question, but I can say that college, and the role it plays in the lives of undergraduates and society at large, has indeed changed from what it once was. Hyper-competitiveness has become an omnipresent force that affects not only undergraduates, but also high school students, graduate students, and professionals. In his essay, Mr. Perlstein provides a glimpse into what many students throughout the country encounter in college today. The intense atmosphere has brought the college experience as it once was known to an end. The opportunity for freedom and self-discovery that was fostered by that experience has disappeared. Childhood, and the freedom to express one’s self without serious consequence, essentially comes to an end in the 8th grade.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/no-title-9/

They were fighting against injustice.

2007-09-24,A Silenced Generation,"In 1974, President Richard Nixon refused to surrender tapes and documents subpoenaed by the Senate Watergate Committee, the American economy was enduring a persistent oil crisis, and my mother turned seventeen. As an early high school graduate, she left Queens, NY for the first time in her life, and began her journey toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The use of the word “journey” is fundamental in this context because one of the most inspirational stories she has to her name is what my mother fondly recalls as her “circuitous path to self-discovery.” This winding route took her to and from various schools across the globe, culminating with an eventual Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minneapolis School of Art and Design and, many years later, a medical degree from Cornell University Medical School. Today it is 2007, and while there is another oil crisis devastating the economies of many American communities, and high ranking officials continue to disregard subpoenas, the college experience has certainly diverged from what it once was. We have come from a generation whose youth believed that the answers to life’s most significant questions were “blowing in the wind,”–to become a new generation of students who want those same answers, right here, right now. Preferably collated. My mother’s college experience, while unique, was not unheard of in the 1960’s and 70’s. Those decades brought about an incredible generation of American adolescents who set out to change the world, one campus at a time; my mother was no exception to this trend. These days, my parents both happily recount experiences of peaceful yet poignant dissidence–my father even has a trove of brightly colored (yet, seldom tie-dyed) pins and badges documenting his participation. To be sure, they were fortunate to grow up in a time where this youthful dissent, while discouraged and opposed, was never effectively quelled. Students felt that their opinions warranted change and consequently, united in their beliefs to create a revolution. Through these demonstrative efforts, they fought for myriad causes of paramount importance: civil rights, humanitarian goals, and of course, peace. In turn, college became a critical time in which students learned from the experience of others and put a unified, tangible strain on conservative minds to consider a more progressive way of life. In March of 1970, for example, there was a protest on the steps of Colby College’s Lorimer Chapel. The protestors quietly assembled for a full week to draw attention to college policies they found were unfair toward minority and underprivileged students. I attend Colby, a private liberal arts college in New England, and I feel extremely proud to be a student at an institution with such a rich history of protest. Yet I admit with resignation, that my college no longer embodies the same activist spirit it once did. Although students sometimes have concerns similar to the Lorimer protestors, nothing remotely comparable to the sit-in would ever occur there today. Indeed, to the dismay of unconventional thinkers everywhere, many of them our own parents, students of my generation are more likely to step either in line or in ‘the box’ then sit down firmly and block the queue.

Around 1:30, the DJ cranked up the opening chords of Pink Floyd’s 1979 classic, “Another Brick in the Wall.” My friends and I, visiting Ukraine as part of a fellowship program for Jewish college students, were ecstatic. As we sang along with Roger Waters’ most famous line (“We don’t need no education “) my friend Aviva suddenly began jumping up and down, hand above her head in that fake-defiant pop-punk gesture popularized by Good Charlotte and other middle-school-friendly rock bands. “Yeah!” she shouted. “We go to school!”",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/another-brick-in-the-ivy-covered-wall-and-proud-of-it/

The all-you-can eat offerings, insensate to concepts of scarcity or seasonality, that grace Stevenson Dining Hall’s daily menu are an affront to the radical tradition of food made from wholesome ingredients by cooperative labor.

We were told that we would be exposed to interesting new people and ideas and that it would be an exciting period of growth like no other. I left home expecting to be immersed in a world of intellectual conversation and stimulating classes. I pictured a college experience like my parents had described to me, full of political activity and freedom of thought but these dreams were shattered shortly after I started school. The whole ordeal seemed to be nothing more than a slightly more intense and less interesting version of high school. I assumed that it was me alone that felt this way and that I simply was not acclimating properly. However, when the issue came up one day in a conversation in the dorm common room, everyone seemed to have similar concerns about the fact that college was not everything they thought it would be. This was two years ago and I am now beginning my junior year at UCLA and have found that these feelings are prevalent in the majority of students that I have met. In truth, college life today is comparatively dry and tedious and leaves students with preciously little free time to pursue their own interests or think about social issues. College has lost its place in the lives of undergraduates because it is no longer the place of freedom of expression and personal growth it once was. As the time and interest students have in political affairs diminishes, so does the value of their experience at universities and the societal importance of college campuses.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-new-high-school/

So, too, do today’s students have the opportunity in their college careers to experiment in hundreds of activities in order to define their interests. Yet, as Rick Perlstein, David Brooks, and others have pointed out, something sets our generation apart from the turbulent college campuses of the 1960s.

However, when asked to contemplate the problem with college in an attempt to evaluate our current understanding of it, I found that I was addressing the wrong question. It is my contention that the query should not be ‘what’s the matter with college’, but rather, more essentially, ‘what’s the matter with our understanding of college’.

In the “old days,” you had to go out into the world to seek the information you desired.

The modern application process alone forced us to thoroughly assess ourselves and our long-term goals. As if this wasn’t enough, we evaluated our own strengths, weaknesses, and dreams, in light of those of our peers, and perhaps even manipulated them, so that we might have a chance, just a chance, at being considered for admission to a competitive university. Most of us were fortunate enough to have had the emotional and financial support of our parents to brace us through the process; however, the average parent is incapable of pulling enough strings to secure a successful future for his or her child.

That’s the way life is. 21 years ago, as I was just a twinkle in my mom’s eye, the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released into some test markets, with many skeptical retailers. Now I can see just how much sweat is pouring off of Shaq’s forehead when I’m shooting free throws on my Playstation 3. He mentions an account of a girl who talks to her dad for 15 minutes on her cell phone and how college students used to dread talking to their parents, trying to distance themselves as much as possible. Maybe it is just me, but that is a perfect example of a generation gap. But yet he claims that’s the problem with college. No gap from the students and their parents. My parents don’t try to like the same things I do, just simply want to be informed on what their son or daughter is up to. I didn’t realize it was a problem to keep in touch with my parents, especially now in a world were I can be reached on my own cell phone, not something my parents had in college, by letter or even better by e-mail.

I find myself in a limbo of sorts, where for once in my life my future is conditional on the fact that I do nothing. My Freudian slip, “nothing,” reveals something interesting though, about our understanding of education, for the slip is hardly individual; it’s national. We find ourselves in the classic conundrum in which education is directly proportional to one’s time in school. In accordance with this logic, for someone like myself in an academic gap, my education is on pause and I can actively do “nothing.” But I have begun to realize that my upcoming time before college is a far cry from a year off; I have a year “on.” And suddenly the burden of free time has become much heavier: my deferred admission is conditional on the fact that I do everything.

His concerns couldn’t have been more shortsighted; in reality, I would argue that UC Berkeley represents a startling trend evident in the elite universities of this country. Contrary to Reagan’s claims, the campus is not licentious, but rather, is growing increasingly conservative and homogenous.

So as I read Perlstein’s article, I began to realize how different my experience at Vassar seemed from the dreary, corporatized atmosphere surrounding the University of Chicago, the school where, as a friend of mine once grimly put it, “fun goes to die.” Sure, many of my peers are career-minded and nearly all are academically resolute, yet there is always a childlike blitheness around campus that never ceases to pull us through even the most stressful pre-examination periods. Indeed, as Perlstein notes, the gap between childhood and college has shortened, but not solely in the sense that, because of the Internet, pre-college students now have more information and ideas at their fingertips than ever before. Despite this, there is still a very genuine, nostalgic attachment to carefree elementary school days that I have noticed not only in Vassar students, but also in my friends at home, many of whom are still eager to revel in classic Disney movies, immerse themselves in the latest Harry Potter book, or, as a friend and I once decided to do, organize a Barbie party.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/barbies-on-wall-street-college-for-the-students-sake/

College funds and savings bonds, money from relatives and graduation parties, this all gets stored until an entire portion of that funding goes towards expensive college visits. Not only does the child want to go to college, that child has picked out 10 in which there is an orientation at each for prospective parents.

2007-09-24,The Evolution of College,"It’s clear that American colleges have changed. Perhaps the changes are mere results of a new generation sprouting the buds of an unknown flower- the future. Rick Perlstein’s “What’s the Matter with College?” is an insightful piece that showcases the evidence that American colleges have changed and the typical higher education experience of seeing the world in a different light has somehow gotten lost over time. It seems as if college has become more of a prerequisite for life while society places a great deal of emphasis on the importance of a college degree. When conducting a survey on Bergen Community College’s campus, the facts were revealed- most students in college are there because they want to get a “good job.” We show up to class (most of the time), but are we really paying attention and getting the most out of our time in college?",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-evolution-of-college/
2007-09-24,Why College Matters,"“All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten.” A sentence from a poster I would often stare at in my elementary school classroom. Of course at the time, I actually was in kindergarten, and interpreted the poster to mean I wouldn’t learn anything useful after kindergarten. In fact, as I went through my elementary years the words and their implications became even more confusing to me. How could this poster actually be suggesting that every year of schooling after kindergarten was just sort of extra? Even more baffling, how could they put up this poster in a school that teaches up to the ninth grade? If the poster was indeed telling the truth, then why did high school matter?",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-31/

2007-09-24,Why College Matters: Reflections of a Recent Graduate,"My high school and college graduation pictures look surprising similar. Same awkwardly positioned four-corner hat, same blue-and-gold colored tassel, same happy smile obscured by a mouth full of braces. Judging by looks alone it might appear that little has changed in the four years between the two ceremonies. But if I try to think back to those high school days, it seems like a different lifetime. A time when I wasn’t always trying to fit my life into a suitcase every summer so that I could move into a new dorm room or apartment. A time when I didn’t automatically refer to my teachers as “doctor” or “professor.” And a time when I would never start a sentence with the word “and” because high school English teachers have a problem with it. But college is above those kinds of rules, it’s liberating. It’s a chance not only to become more independent, but also to be exposed to a higher level of knowledge or a different view of a subject that will hopefully leave you with a new respect for how much humans have achieved. Even more importantly, it’s a chance for you to hide from the “real world” under the title of “student” for one last time while you figure out where exactly you fit into society and what you want to do with your life. So while the university experience may differ across generations, I think that it will always play an important role in shaping the lives of young adults.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-reflections-of-a-recent-graduate/

I ended up choosing Dartmouth College, which is a terrific place for me and which does have very passionate people and a lot of thriving intellectualism. I love it there. During my first spring at Dartmouth I took a course in Recent US History where the professor showed us a film entitled “Berkeley in the Sixties,” about the antiwar student movement.

You just leave my college-going generation alone, thank you.” As a senior entering my emotionally charged last year, I was antagonized by the author’s smug reminiscences, the those-were-the-days attitude that every younger-than person is bound to resent. By his eagerness to declare the mass disaffection of undergrads and the soullessness of the system based on some “stories” from his grouchy U of C informant. I was considerably miffed. Somehow I have not been infantilized or brainwashed into market-speak by the college machine, yet have managed to enjoy college in my own way. I resent any imprecations against it–especially as I near the end, and everything college related becomes amber-tinted and sacred.

2007-09-24,So What if it isn’t the ’60s Anymore?,"Going to the annual conference of ACLU of the State of Illinois with a bunch of my friends was a very interesting experience. I really enjoyed hearing about civil liberties issues in the State and what the ACLU of Illinois had done about them or was planning to do about them in the coming year. However, something at the conference really bugged me. Everyone there kept complimenting my friends and I for being unusually politically active, always immediately followed by grumbling about how college has generally gone to hell-in-a-hand-basket, and how in their day my activist friends and I wouldn’t be the exception, but the rule. They blathered on about activism in the 60’s, how they had fought against censorship and a war they thought was unjust, and how today college students just don’t care anymore. I think that they, along with many other aging liberals, suffer from the same problem in their thinking. That is to say that they don’t realize it isn’t the 60’s anymore. The 1960s were a very special time in American cultural history. Young people begin to break away from traditional cultural norms, exploring sex and drugs and reactionary politics. This, coupled with the political atmosphere at the time “overshadowed by the controversial Vietnam War and a government that tried to suppress many forms of thought” created an explosive situation. It was cool to rebel, to do things just because there were counter to the way that things had been done before. Pop-culture on college campuses was all about sticking it to the man, and there was a saying “never trust anyone over thirty.”",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/so-what-if-it-isnt-the-60s-anymore/
2007-09-24,The College Experience,"Rick Perlstein stumbles on the crux of the matter, the culprit behind the marginalization of the college experience, but fails to pursue the point further. Perlstein notes that the distance between the campus and the market has shrunk, but the deeper truth is that the campus is for sale on the market like never before, and it is this fact that has driven the depreciation of the value of college. Today, wealth and privilege arguably play less of a role in admissions, at least at a state university like my own. Nevertheless, parents and children of every income level see themselves primarily as customers in a transaction. The Times itself noted in 1998 [1] that colleges are “increasingly viewed as employment credentialing stations.” Perhaps I am naive to assume that it has ever been otherwise, that college was ever seen as more than a means, but at the least, it was an opinion that would have once elicited consternation instead of cheerful acceptance or weary resignation. It has been precisely what I would call the ‘instrumentalization’ of the college experience that has led to its devaluation.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-college-experience/
2007-09-24,The Debate on What’s the Matter With College,"Early in my childhood, being the descendent of Puerto Rican Immigrants–from the age of 8 or 9, managing family affairs became a necessity. In the mid-1960s, my father moved from Puerto Rico to the United States to seek employment. Only months after his arrival to the States, he met an acquaintance from his small childhood town of Patillas, Puerto Rico. That acquaintance, who happened to leave Puerto Rico with the same intentions as my father, seeking opportunity in the Promise Land – was none other than now my mother. Having spoken very little English, they came to depend on me for most of their household financial affairs – including, English translations, banking, savings, bill payments and record keeping. My father having completed school to the fourth grade and my mother, according to my father, unable to handle financial affairs despite the fact she was in deed a high school graduate. Needless to say, education was not a priority in our home. Sadly, looking back on life, education – I should say college-bound education didn’t seem like much a priority for any of my low to middle-income friends. Those who went on to college it seemed were the rich and well to do kids – those kids where college was expected of them.

Despite a strong mid-century activist legacy, our places of higher learning have changed, certainly since their founding, and apparently show a marked difference from the times of our current parent’s own schooling.

But then, as I began to really think about everything that I’ve experienced, I reminded myself how there are more and more college students who are going about college way differently from how I have. And money is a very good example of that. One of the first things I learned about college I learned from an old Bill Cosby stand-up special. Mr. Cosby said, “I tell my kids, ‘Your mother and I are rich. You have NOTHING.'” As someone who lives in Texas and attends school in Madison, Wisconsin, I can certainly identi fy with the feeling of having nothing.

2007-09-24,Has College Really Changed?,"Not too long ago, Rick Perlstein assures us, universities in this country had a certain cultural and political cachet. In California, the public university system was at the heart of the 1966 governor’s race. The campuses had a “centrality.” They were a “national obsession.” Today’s kids, he somberly informs us, barely match up. We are alternatively too enmeshed in the market or too infantilized. We have been measured and we have come up lacking. I have only one response: Have you really looked at us?",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/has-college-really-changed/
2007-09-24,“College as America used to understand it is coming to an end”,"In this brief sentence I believe that Mr. Perlstein accuratelyassesses the changing, perhaps already changed, nature of the “collegeexperience” and the role it is perceived as playing in theintellectual and social advancement of the college student. He isundoubtably right in realizing the tides are changing; we need onlylook at the social and political environment of the previous eras inwhich men like Doug Mitchell attended college to see the disparitiesin social perception and life experience between the college youth of,for example, the sixties, and the college youth of today. Mitchell’swas a time of social upheaval, when America and its children werequesting for a new identity and an opportunity to improve the world;it was indeed the liberal hour during which the faith thatintellectual idealism and political progressivism held the key to thefuture of humanity ran rampant. Colleges at the time were, of course,intimately linked to this phenomenon, and served as incubators forbudding intellectuals and safe-havens for political theorizing anddebate. Today, we live in a very different social climate, one inwhich faith in the government has greatly dwindled, and dwindlesstill, and a certain mixture of fear and paranoia have cast aparalyzing shadow over the sunny progressivism of days now gone by.Disillusionment with the two-party system, or at least with the twoparties themselves, widely publicized government fiascos and scandal,floundering support for the president, and fear of disturbing worldrealities like terrorism have created a situation where people haveinsulated themselves from the realm of external world affairs,“Politics” and all it entails. Others have cynically decided that, forthem, opportunism and not philanthropy promises to be the mostfulfilling of philosophies. This I think, is integral to understandingthe circumstances of the change. If the average college student nowgrows up in an environment where political expression andphilosophical cultivation is much less encouraged, he or she willreflect that, and the old perception of American colleges as hotbedsof political activism will come to be outdated. This being so, thequestions remain “What is the nature and consequence of this change?”and “What is the perceived role of college now for most students?”",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-as-america-used-to-understand-it-is-coming-to-an-end/

That was almost forty years ago–forty years of collegiate peace that have made such an uprising almost unthinkable now. Why is this so? Why are today’s campuses such docile places?

I only looked for small schools, for big castle-like buildings, a teacher ratio of 10 to 1, and lots and lots of trees. I wanted a college version of my California high school where some students did not wear shoes, boys grew their hair long, and teachers lay out in the grass eating their vegetarian lunches.

2007-09-24,Why College Matters,"Every April, I freak out. Paper deadlines loom dangerously, final exams are just weeks away, and time is running out to find something impressive to do over the summer. Each night, I retreat to my nook in the library, armed with the usual end-of-semester paraphernalia: laptop, granola bars, notes to be spread out and piled high. I wonder how on earth the year passed by so quickly, and vow not to let anything, not even the warmth of early spring, distract me from my last chances at good grades. But on an unusually frigid Monday last April, when I should have been seated in a seminar room discussing Mary Wollstonecraft’s feminist thought, I was at Boston’s Heartbreak Hill, scanning the Boston Marathon crowd for my friends Becca and Sophia. They didn’t mind when I initially said I’d be unable to cheer them on, understanding not only that April is a high-stress month, but also that I’m a high-stress person. However, our friends Stephanie, Dave, and Greg, all much nicer and less nerdy than I am, were going to Boston, and, following a moment of weakness, I was on board, too, though not without reservations. It was one of the most un-me things I’d ever done, cutting class in April, and I couldn’t quite believe I was actually doing it until I got off the Greyhound at South Station, heavy with guilt.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-36/
2007-09-24,The Buy-In,"I’ll begin by admitting: I bought into it. I “was swindled” by those savvy marketing strategies, which Rick Perlstein discovers at the end of his article, “What’s the matter with college?” Put simply, college has lost its intrinsic value as an institution and continues to search for the lucky students whom they will impress and extend the invitation of admittance.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-buy-in/
2007-09-24,Why Not College?,"People associate attending a university or college with broadening their intellectual horizons, exploring new political and social issues, and finally reaching the point in their life when they can live completely independently. As an incoming freshman I cannot say for sure whether all those preconceived notions of college are accurate or inaccurate. However I do know that after a year of stressing over college essays, grades, and test scores, I have very high expectations for what my college experience will be. Currently I am undecided in what my major is going to be, and every college I visited promised me that through the curriculum their school provides I will find my passion. This I believe will be true. I have also been promised an environment of strong political activism, where I will have the opportunity to get involved in any sort of issue or cause if I choose to. This I believe will be true. And college has also promised me an environment where I will meet new people, and have the opportunity to try and see things that I previously never have. This I also believe will be true. All of these different experiences are the appeals that college offers to its students, and it has been this way since the 1960’s. Therefore, if college is offering the same academic and social experience as before, why are college campuses becoming more and more apathetic? In my opinion the problem is not that college is changing, but rather that our society as a whole is. It’s not that “College as America used to understand it is coming to an end.” It’s that America as the citizens of this country used to understand it is coming to an end.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-not-college/

Just like the building some call home is not the central focus of their life, but the customs of their families and the culture they were raised in are, so university campuses are not he focus of the college experience, but the culture in which they grow and have an impact on is.

2007-09-24,Is the college experience less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago?,"College as a higher education institution is critical to the individual student and to the nation as a whole but, the “college experience” is of much lesser value than it was in the 1960’s and 1970’s. Today, the college student is more competitive; career focused and has a different agenda for their education than they had in the past. Students now are taught by the very nature of the college admission process that they must compete with grades, SAT scores and many other individuals to be admitted to the college of their first choice. Students have been groomed from a very young age with the question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” that many have been focused on their life’s aspirations for many years prior to stepping foot on campus. Students seem to almost grow up quicker and have many more life experiences prior to college age. They read books in high school that were once required reading for college and this puts them ahead of where previous college students were at the start of their college experience. They have the chance to go abroad on school trips and have life experiences that were once reserved for the college student. Students in the 1960’s and 1970’s led more sheltered lives prior to college. Theses student’s life experiences with politics, taking action for a cause and new found freedoms, began when they left the confines of their homes and arrived on a college campus. Students today have much more information available to them via the internet and 24 hour cable news reports and are informed and aware of the world around them at a much younger age. The students from a generation ago had a more limited amount of exposure to the world’s events. Their parents had more control over the amount of information one received from radio, television and newsprint. Good or bad the children of today are exposed to a constant amount of news from all areas of media. Today’s students have already had opportunities to join and be part of many causes such as Relay for Life or MS walk and do not have to wait until they are out of the house and on a college campus before becoming part of a cause.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/is-the-college-experience-less-critical-to-the-nation-than-it-was-a-generation-ago/

Three nineteen year old males, with long limp hair and slouching lean bodies to match, were tossing a Frisbee in lazy arcs. Two were shirtless; the third wore a tie-dyed Grateful Dead t-shirt. Three generations of women stood to the side, observing.

I got a combined SAT score of 1500 and applied to a total of three colleges chosen primarily on the basis of family history and the “prestige factor” (Harvard, Princeton, etc…). I don’t stand out in any statistics and no admissions offices are scrambling over themselves to fill the “upper-middle class Caucasian woman” quota… so I guess you could say I’m that faceless college student that we’re all competing against, the overachiever that threatens us with their well-rounded resume and impressive GPA. I’m everyone’s worst nightmare, just like every other college student with their original ideas and their up-‘n-at-’em attitude are incentives for making my own collegeexperience a living hell. Mr. Perlstein asked, ‘What’s wrong with colleges today?’ I reply that the rat race mentality has poisoned the intellectual atmosphere of our nation’s universities and turned “college” into just another cog in the societal machine that rushes us into our graves on the 9-to-5-shift assembly line. Instead of being leaders of our national culture, the college-agecohort has been demoted to the bottom of the corporate ladder, and as college students we’re all battling for the next promotion.

Nowadays, most students are more willing to protest Friday classes and the food selection in the cafeteria than the genocide in the Sudan. While there are groups at every campus who are politically-minded, many of their peers would consider them, in Ronald Reagan’s words, to be “a noisy, dissident minority.” To some extent, self-interest has replaced the idealism of the past.

Three years out I’ve become used to giving family friends the sunny responses they want to hear to questions like “Is college everything you hoped it would be?” and “Oh, I bet you’re making all A’s.” The truth is that today’s college experience is in some ways the deformed descendant of the college experience that indelibly animated the 1960s.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/reflections-by-the-ungraduated/

2007-09-24,Of Belushi and Black Panthers,"In American culture, college life is somewhat of an ideal. Some of this ideal is informed by a steady stream of films since ‘Animal House’ which portray college as a four-year long drunken orgy, interrupted only by the occasional football game and sociology class. But most of it is informed by our parents’ delusional nostalgia. My generation has been told since childhood that college is a person’s only chance to enjoy the independence of adulthood without its responsibilities. It is a time of unparalleled fun, maturation, and intellectual stimulation, after which we will emerge as confident, wise, and self-aware adults with, of course, earning potentials that exceed that of our parents. In college, I’ve often been told, I must seize the opportunity to ‘find myself.’ Unfortunately, the dispensaries of this advice are often unable to adequately explain what exactly ‘finding myself’ entails.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/of-belushi-and-black-panthers/
2007-09-24,Creating Controversy Our Way,"I’m not sure that I would have put the time or thought necessary to write this essay had it been offered during the time when I attend college. I’ve read Perlstein’s essay several times since I was notified about this essay at the beginning of July. Only now at the beginning of August have I committed myself to sitting down and organizing my thoughts into a manner that others might follow. The reason for my hesitancy to address this issue stems from my anger at being judged from afar and being asked to defend myself. When Perlstein asks “What’s the Matter with College?” I read “What’s the Matter With College Students?”. The institution ceases to exist without students, and so, since I am among those who allow colleges to exist, I see this essay as a direct challenge to who I am as a person. “Is the college experience less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago?” It is patently absurd to define the “college experience” when you consider the plethora of diversity among individuals attending college today. This was obviously not so in the 1960’s, and there is no common denominator for comparing the events of the ’60’s with the events of today.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/creating-controversy-our-way/

2007-09-24,"College Anxiety, Version 2","Large-scale political dissent, heated philosophical debates in smoky dorm rooms, and rebellion against the conservative mores of financial gain and capitalism may be difficult to spot on most college campuses today, but that cannot be construed as a sign that college has lost its relevance to American culture, that students no longer care about the power a college education gives them, or that concern about the goings on at college campuses stopped when building takeovers did. Preoccupation with, and anxiety about college are rampant in the United States. Read any news publication for one week, and I guarantee there will be an article about college. But instead of it being a piece decrying the falling moral standards at our nations top educational institutions, as it would have been forty years ago, it will be a mournful article about how expensive college is, or a haughty one about how selective it is, or a human interest story about a student who is the first in her family to attend college.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-anxiety-version-2/

Thank God almighty, we are free at last!” My apropos usage of Martin Luther King Jr’s famous quotation to describe leaving for college may be clichéd, hackneyed, and slightly irresponsible. But I didn’t care at the time. I celebrated my emancipation from tyrannical African parents until my first paper was assigned. After which, I settled into college life. Ah, college! Three years ago, an eager, younger version of myself left my parent’s house hating the school I was driving to but happy for the change in scenery. My family is originally from Ghana, and if there’s one truth every child of African parents knows, it’s that you’re wrong. Although during my high school senior year I had decided on entering a small liberal arts college, my parents coerced me into attending the state university where my father taught. Coercion doesn’t fully describe it. My parents conducted a battle of ideological (yelling) and financial attrition until I resigned myself to the school of my nightmares.

During the interview portion of the program, it also became apparent that all three competitors had either undergraduate degrees or higher. One could argue that participation in the show is highly selective (and one would be correct), but irregardless of this fact, there were two significant conclusions to draw from this one experience. First was that a lot of Americans have college degrees these days, and second was that television programs exist from which people of any age can learn about the world, its people, and how they interact. Expanding on the latter concept, the media has extended its reach throughout the nation, into its homes, living rooms, and computers.

2007-09-24,Why College Matters,"The gathering of protestors at the base of Bascom Hill, the iconic center of the University of Wisconsin campus, featured a carnival atmosphere on the morning of October 18, 1967. An Uncle Sam on stilts teetered above the crowd, another activist impersonated President Johnson and the San Francisco Mime Troupe appeared in whiteface as the Guerrilla Marching Band. Activists banged tambourines while students assembled to stage an obstructive sit-in at the building where recruiters from Dow Chemical Company, the military’s supplier of napalm, were conducting placement interviews, as David Maraniss described the scene in They Marched Into Sunlight. The crowd of protestors had grown to well over a thousand by noon, and around 1:30 p.m., police forced their way in to clear the building. What happened next shocked the city and eventually the nation, as the churning mass of students inside the building fell like grain under the scything of police batons. Forty-seven students w ere treated at the university medical center that day, and many more left with eyes reddened by tear gas, released for the first time ever on the campus. Madison soon became known as one of the most anti-war campuses in America, considered by some to be the Berkeley of the Midwest. Madison saw protests again at the start of the build-up to the Iraq War, but nothing that could match the Vietnam protests for violence or cultural significance. In this, the campus serves as a microcosm for the nation’s universities as a whole, a barometer of activism that has fallen over time. And as the status of the American campus has descended to a tepid lull, the attention of the American public has waned. There are no more headlines about student protests. The nation no longer knows or cares what happens on these serene islands of academia, even though someday these students will be solving the problems created by a leadership that came of age in Vietnam. Former Wisconsin administrator Paul Ginsberg, who watched both the Vietnam and Iraq antiwar movements unfold, found that the Iraq protests were marked by a certain placidness that barely disturbed the quiet serenity that reigned over campus. The result was classic pothole theory, a catchphrase harkening back to the Vietnam era: Nobody goes to harangue the city council until a pothole appears on their street. In short, nobody’s paying attention to college students because they’re not causing any fuss.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-54/

I chose Wesleyan because with my Liberal Arts background, it seemed a perfect fit. All of my credits transferred in, so I began there as a junior, with 30 credits remaining for my bachelor’s degree. I was returning to college after being out for a few years and needed a program that fit my lifestyle, work, etc. The classes are small, with about 12-15 people in each one, are in the evenings, and Saturday mornings. Anyone who is in this program will tell you that it is a challenge, whether you are just starting college, or finishing the required coursework. When I went through the graduation ceremony, it was with 249 other graduates, on a sunny Saturday morning, this past Mother’s day weekend. I had the biggest smile of anyone there. I had friends from work and my boyfriend of 8 years was in the bleachers, beaming, and the counselors from school were there too, to support all of our efforts. This was without a doubt one of the single best days of my life. If I were the age of the average college student, this would not be the case. Some of the kids around me could not wait to get out of there and head for the beach. I was so excited to be there, and realizing I was finally going to graduate, made me cry, too.

More accurately, I went to Vassar because of “The Heidi Chronicles.” I’d read the play in 10th grade English and had fallen head-over-heels for Heidi. I was all but alone in my adoration though. My high school- a mahogany bastion of conservatism and white privilege- was populated largely by WASPs and Young Republicans. Unsurprisingly, neither group warmed to a play about a feminist Art History professor, her gay best friend, and a self-satisfied Jew. A Jew and a feminist in my own right, I was entranced. And so, when it came time to start looking at colleges, I remembered Heidi Holland.

Just because this era’s raging radicals have shifted their baseball caps to the side and chosen tapered jeans or spandex (otherwise known as leggings) to substitute long bohemian skirts and bandanas decorated with peace signs doesn’t mean college has lost it’s life. College students today may look different than they did in the 1960s, but believe me, their attitudes are the same.

2007-09-24,The Ebb & Flow of Internet 2.0,"I woke up this morning, poured myself a bowl of Grape-Nuts, and sat down in front of my computer to watch a video over the Internet of an Iranian woman being stoned to death. I was a bit queasy, a bit unsettled, but certainly engaged by the footage. I could have just as easily read up on the footage at any number of news websites, human rights blogs, news channels with multiple shows and personalities – or I could have passed a glance at a headline in a newspaper: “IRANIAN WOMAN STONED WITHOUT REMORSE.” The event is not particularly news to me. Not in the sense that I have come to expect it (a sensibility I would have indeed come to have exercised, given a literally never-ending deluge of information about such events), but rather in that it has simply lost its interest, its engagement, its flash of relevance in my significantly less afflicting life. I realize now that I have been desensitized to the rapid flow of information not because of the content itself, but because of its close-wed relationship to the laurels upon which the college generation of the Vietnam-era America had established for the future of academia, and it is here as a college student that I can attest to the change of college as I envisioned it in America’s fabric to the lived reality of it. Rick Perlstein writes in What’s the Matter With College? that College has fallen in strength due to the apathy felt among students towards the very distinct changes from high school and post college life, viewing it with an obfuscated sense of their lives’ great times. College is supposed to be the springtime of one’s life; a season that has been muddled into a haze by Perlstein’s account, citing the many students who have come to resent their collegiate experience. The article does justice to the one socially relevant concern – “What happened to College?” – to me and my have been wondering, as well as exposing the large rift between the Vietnam- and Iraq-era concepts of College. Information and its rapid flow – often considered to be one of the defining characteristics of this generation – have served to inform a surge of people in the world to come to maintain keen awareness of its vitality and importance in their lives – or they could maintain a keen façade. The progressive template of the students of the 60’s and 70’s has come to feel to large to the students of the yet unnamed00’s (yet unnamed, appropriately enough) due in large part to this desensitization to information and, tragically enough, the most prevalent of indicators for the generation to come. The loss of bona fide Collegiate intrigue is found in the advent of Internet 2.0 and the role of global events and current activity in forming the character of the current College generation.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-ebb-flow-of-internet-20/
2007-09-24,Today’s American College Experience: Quiet Revolution,"In Rick Perlstein’s article “What’s The Matter with College”, he asserts that the discrete college experience, a time and place separate from everything that came before and everything that would follow after, no longer exists. As a current undergraduate, I have to agree. In most ways, college life for me has been an extension of my high school years and simultaneously the start of my immersion into the infamous “real world.” Instead of disassociating myself from the friends, interests, and beliefs I had before college, I, along with most of my fellow classmates, are building on what came before college. We are also looking ahead to what will come after, which often translates to our professional lives. As Perlstein points out, for those who came of age in the cataclysmic 1960s and 1970s, the college experience of today often seems tame and even depressing. After all, to the outside eye my generation is not breaking down entrenched social barriers or reshaping the political landscape like my parents’ generation did. We appear to stand for little and act on even less. Mostly, we seem disaffected and unaware of the troubles facing our country and world. My challenge to anyone who feels that way is to take another look. For, while the college experience now is not the distinct time and place that it once was, it is most certainly revolutionizing America.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/todays-american-college-experience-quiet-revolution/

What is the view of college today though? Is it different? Rick Perlstein seems to believe the view has been altered over the years.

Well I have my own reactions to why this seems so, and I will also explain why college is still very important, but it is not the defining factor in our society today. To compare the college generation today to the college generations of the 1960s and 1970s is to compare two different eras, two different cultures, and two very different citizens of The United States. As a current student at Rutgers University, The State School of New Jersey in the information age I willingly and unwillingly make decisions everyday based on the era in which I lived. My fellow college students and I are constantly connected to the people we interact with. Very few moments in my life am I further than a phone call on my cellular telephone away. Previous generations have not had that luxury; there was a time difference with uncertainty because of the delay of communication. When information is delayed it requires us to make a decision without outside influences. Within the college community the quest for knowledge is no longer verbally transmitted to the extent it once was. The forum to display views is now on the internet. Even television today is not an open communication, what is received by our television and eventually by its patrons is decided by major corporations with their own political agendas.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-the-next-step/

Not only did it mean freedom from my parents, their rules and household chores but also the first opportunity to make decisions on my own and for myself. The key phrase being “on my own and for myself.” It seems like quite the freedom to be able to decide what’s best for you and to not have your mother or father breathing down your neck giving you advice because “they know best.” (The fact of the matter is however that yes, they really do know best). While this may seem like the moment in life to run far, far away without ever looking back, for many young adults it turns out to be nothing of the sort. And this I feel is because most 18-year-olds are not “looking in the right direction” and are not focused on, in my opinion, what should matter most – their future.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/of-a-different-culture/

There will be ten minutes between classes for me and my colleagues to go into the swarm of students and make as many people aware of our campaign and why it’s important to ensure that University of Michigan apparel is not made in sweatshops. The results are minimal. A girl wearing Uggs enters the building, sees me with a flier and clipboard, and walks faster to avoid me. So does the young man wearing his fraternity letters, the punk rocker with his headphones, the stoner with dreadlocks and the hunched-over engineer.

2007-09-24,College Sure Has Changed,"Rick Perlstein argues in “What’s the matter with College?” that college campuses have lost their centrality largely due to the lack of radicalism that is generated on campus compared to the vibrant, radical, take-over-the-administration-building late 1960’s and early 1970’s. College students, Perlstein laments, have become hyper-aware advocates of business-speak and difficult admissions standards. Colleges have lost their place as incubators of radicalism, and no longer provide a “discrete experience” that provided a “radical break” between childhood and the “real world”. Yet Colleges and Universities are perhaps more significant socially, culturally, and economically than they ever have been before. With no raiding of campus buildings to do, how can the modern college student possibly prove his/her worth to society at large? If politicians fail to rail against the depravities of college campuses, then how can they be relevant?This past fall, nearly 18 million college students were enrolled in the 4,216 institutions of higher education that grant degrees in the United States alone, up from the 12 million 25 year ago. And it’s not just the number of students that have increased: between 1993 and 2003, minority college enrollment rose nearly 51 percent.

The decline of higher education’s effect on the national culture is actually giving way to something much more significant, a growing consciousness that enables discussion rather than demonstration.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/learning-discussion/
2007-09-24,Unititled,"American author Reynolds Price once astutely asserted, “I always say the late 60s, early 70s in American education were really exciting times to teach. The late 70s, on the other hand, were awfully dull. People tended to be quiet and repressed and all headed off to business school or something.” A generation ago, college was an institution, where only a select group of individuals, from the wealthiest upper echelons of society could afford to attend. Devoid of the economic burden, these students were exposed to coming of age experiences vastly different from the children of the average 1950s all-American family and were free to expand their minds. But, today, more and more students from all realms of society are attending college than ever recorded and these new students are singing a different tune. College today is as necessary, if not more crucial to the future of young adults like myself than a generation ago, but for the majority of students it has been reduced to a mere career-training ground, a steppingstone for the “Real World”.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/unititled/
2007-09-24,The Pen,"Hold a pen in front of you and look at it; notice its size and color in particular. Now, slowly move it away until you have your arm fully extended. Notice anything different? Probably not, and that is how it should be. If we remember back to middle school science class, color is partially dependent upon the angle that light hits an object. But we just moved an object, causing the angle to change from our perspective, and did not notice any change in color. The pen also moved further away without any apparent change in size. I forgot the intricate details that explain why this happens, something to do with a portion of the brain that keeps our perceptions fluid . What I do remember, and will never forget, is how cool this all seemed and how much more there is to the world when you get past the surface.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-pen/

The greatest tragedy that would befall my classmates and I would be the waitlist of an ivy-league or equally prestigious school. The college process consumed me. The Fisk College Guidebook became my nightly bedtime story, I almost invited my SAT tutor to a family function, and I diligently lunched with my college officer weekly, reviewing application details.

Current economical trends, however, have given colleges and universities an additional prospect: to supply a, highly skilled, large workforce that will replace retiring baby boomers, the most educated individuals in American history. Besides satisfying these national standards, we also have global considerations to worry about. Contemporary American and international culture has become increasingly demanding and complicated for several reasons. Most of which involve technological advances, expansion of markets, and the increasing efficiency of communication. If we want to survive adequately college education not a choice it is a necessity.

I expected them to gush over what colleges they were going to, what they wanted to study, the excitement and the fears of leaving home for the first time… or at least care. To my surprise, every question I had about their impending future was met with them same boredom infused “I don’t know, I guess I’ll go to college” response. I was really shocked and confused; maybe it was just these girls who couldn’t muster up any enthusiasm for this new chapter of their lives, or maybe I was in the minority of students who couldn’t wait to live out the proactive adventures I had read about in books like The Virgin of Benington or in the writings of Gloria Steinem and Erica Jong. But when I look back to two years ago when I first arrived at school, in all honesty, I am disappointed with my experience thus far. I have found that most students have the same indifferent attitude towards the unique experience of attending an institution of higher learning and it appears that this wave of apathetic entitlement is what defines the modern college culture.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-coin-has-been-cheapened-a-response-to-whats-the-matter-with-college/

2007-09-24,Collegiate Vigor of the ’60s: Lost or Elevated?,"Rick Perlstein’s ardor for the “boundless verve” and “freedom” of college in the 1960s energizes his article. Actually, Perlstein’s revelations of unrestrained vigor exposed the post-midnight fantasies that my roommate and I would fashion within our naïve, playful college minds. “If you could live in any 20th century decade, which one would it be?” I’d ask. “Oh the ’60s!” Aimee would sigh, as though spellbound by romance. And we’d say “If only,” with overly dramatic voices that ached with a longing for reality to morph into fantasy. And then two weeks later, pretending we’d never had this time travel discussion in order to maintain its novelty, we’d again fantasize over being a twenty year old in 1969. We were like some small, somewhat pathetic illustration of Perlstein’s frustration over how college today lacks the spontaneous vigor of college back then. Perlstein’s conviction must have merit if two college women, both raised at all girls’ high schools to appreciate their modern opportunities as victories of a feminist movement, yearn to be flower girls. Well, we’d be educated flower girls, we thought. We wanted to be the irrepressibly passionate Ali MacGraw in Love Story. Desire so often springs from deprivation.

Perlstein describes the college experience of the 1960’s and 70’s as a “social- mobility prerequisite”. Perhaps this is no longer true. I have met a lot of students my age who are pursuing law, engineering, or medical degrees. Many admit that they are pursuing subjects that lead to careers that their parents approve of, despite their own desires. However, there is awareness among my generation that college is no longer the one-way ticket to a higher step on the social ladder.

What we thought was cool was actually the watered-down college experience given to us by a tyrannical administration. This year, however, I’m a senior, and I received word that someone in my class (without any sense of irony) was trying to revive this concept and sell the shirts themselves.

It’s the journey.” And so I felt it was appropriate for my senior year writing project, that I should fill my pages with stories of my journey from freshman to senior year at Denison. I wrote about the roommates I had, the friendships that unraveled, the classes I’d taken, and whether or not I really had traveled all that far in the end. But mostly I wrote about television, Facebook, AIM, and MySpace: the pillars of my undergraduate education. I started the project by explaining to my writing advisor, Holly, a teacher only about five years my senior and fresh out of grad school–that the difference between Denison University and the rest of the colleges and universities in the country was that we at Denison lived in a bubble. Greek life was the end-all-be-all to my classmates and who was dating who mattered much more to most of the kids on campus than what was happening in Iraq, Darfur, the White House, or even the rural Ohio communities surrounding campus.

Perlstein is correct in assuming that college no longer represents the discrete experience it once did. However, he does not account for the fact that it no longer should. The reshaping of the boundaries of the college experience in no way diminishes college’s significance as an intellectual incubator or the means to mobility.

I look up at the massive structure that is Gillett Hall, my home for the next year, and I feel like I’ve just been plopped into an Alex Kotlowitz book. With twenty-year old window units hanging out of most rooms in a forty-year old building, it does not make for a reassuring sight to a kid from the Chicago suburbs. To cement the Henry Horner housing projects imagery is a basketball court next to the building, on which every player is black. This is more than just a minor change from where I came from, where my idea of diversity used to be the half-black, half-Filipino Barack Obama-wannabe at my high school. Into the fortress I go, and up to my floor in a (yay!) working elevator. I walk down a hallway that can only be described as a fluorescent tomb, and my hopes and expectations fall by the second. I spot what I think is a puke stain just a few steps from my door, but it blends so effortlessly with the brownish carpet that I can’t safely say what it is. At the fourth door down the hallway, I come upon my room: 434. I open the door and drop my bags, and with them go my jaw. I had known before this day the exact dimensions of the room, but in person, the 11 x 13 foot room is somehow even smaller than I had previously imagined.

His inspirations are former students from the 60s, whose effusive commentary about the “boundless verve” of their decade stand in alarming contrast to his interviewees, current college students who are either consumed by today’s social ennui or are blissfully ignorant of it. His assessment is, on the surface, fair enough. We are no longer under direct attack by the political majority as a threat to the establishment. I cannot recall a single evening spent discussing subversive reading materials or planning a “sit in” in the administration building. But in my experience, the assertion that the college world has lost its edge, its soul, and its importance could not be farther from the truth.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-44/

Their intensity, discipline, and drive were no surprise, but I was taken aback by their professed goals and aspirations. Almost unanimously, they hoped to study economics or business and to work in finance. Being from Harvard, this was nothing I hadn’t encountered on a daily basis, but when I asked what motivated their interest I was surprised by the response. Very candidly (and with a face that screamed, “are you an idiot?”) one girl offered her succinct reply–“the money.”",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/whats-the-matter-with-college-follow-the-money/

College presented this new beginning to me and for that I can never really understand people’s dissatisfactions with it. Certainly you can draw out the experience until it only hinders you, and surely you can attend a place under your parents’ restrictions. But the difference with college is that you know beforehand that there are only a certain number of years to experience it (whether it be two, four, or more in graduate school) and that yields the components to a period of discovery.

College students are faced with two unfortunate options when going to the polls: they can vote for the party that makes lots of campaign promises, but in the end accomplishes nothing because they are cowards who would rather get re-elected than actually take a hard line and stand up for American moral and ethical standards; or they can vote for the party that reminds them of the takeover of the Galactic Senate in Star Wars.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/college-students-need-a-voice/

While Perlstein was certainly correct in assuming that the institution of college as it has been known in recent decades is coming to an end, the ways that college has changed have put it on a new and intensely centralized pedestal.

He recalled his intense discussions on race relations, an issue he found himself more and more sympathetic towards. College is about redefining your point of view, he would cheerfully advise me.

The truth of the matter is that no matter how much I am truly fascinated with the history of the late 60s and early 70s, and do genuinely admire a great deal of what they accomplished, it is their generation who has asked my peers to stand up and fight for Vietnam the Sequel, or who are at least complicit in its ugly evolution by failing to adequately challenge its conception, when they should have known better. Their participation in the Iraq War, whether active or passive, proves to some extent that they did not have it all right, and makes one wonder how much useful knowledge was actually gleaned from their experiences. To imply that we are in some way failing the college legacy because we do not now resemble them is both narcissistic and false. I believe it is my own generation’s awareness of the limitations of the peace movement, combined with the fact that protesting today is no longer the radical act of defiance that it once was, that makes us tentative to emerge from the insulation of our iPod universes, and to seek change through the social movements and civil disobedience that evoked the fear and ire of California gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan 40 years ago.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/you-said-you-wanted-a-revolution/

This statement is ill informed. Students and their respective universities need not reevaluate their current standing.

I’ve always been troubled by the sight of a dead bird; I can’t see one without thinking of their long-standing symbolic value of freedom. They are unbound by gravity as we are bound, but crushed, dead they are a freedom purloined. This removal of freedom is a starting point for the transformation of the college experience from the 1960s. College cannot be what it once was; the collectivity of the college lifestyle has disintegrated to a singular experience in which it has become impossible to care outside of oneself.

Furthermore, they never tell me what people “my age” are supposed to be caring about. About the war in Iraq? About gay marriage? About the world? We do care about all those things. The problem is that we haven’t seen any results. Even with all those protests and sit-ins, the Vietnam conflict continued for a few years before the government finally listened. No one seems to be listening to us, either. We do protest. We participate in the day of silence, or we don’t go to class for a day to protest the anti-immigration laws. We sign petitions.

Through parental pressure and a desperate need to keep up with the rest of the material-driven world, students today place a much stronger emphasis on what they can gain from college, rather than what they can learn from their time at school. A college degree has always held a significant amount of weight in the job market, but in more recent years it has been seen as more of a requirement for those seeking employment in the professional workforce. In response, colleges have had to cater to a much larger and more diverse population of students, many of whom see college only as the next step to a career. The responsibility for the change in the institution of secondary education does not rest on the shoulders of the colleges themselves; like any other successful business, they are simply reacting to the wants of their consumers – who demand success, wealth, and power at a higher rate than ever before.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/the-self-centered-collegiate-universe/

In fact, the generation gap that we have all been waiting for in the education system has finally occurred. There was a time where college was an option. An individual could go into the workforce, could join an armed force, OR go to college. However, as time has passed, there now is the recognition of education. Where companies that once may have given a direct chance towards a high school graduate fifty years ago must now make sure that these individuals, people like myself, have a college degree along with in-job experience.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/no-title/
2007-09-24,College Remains Relevant,"In his fantasy of the 1960s, Mr. Perlstein longs for the good old days of college: a hippie-radical-beatnik’s paradise, free of social conventions and responsibility. He feels that his nostalgic vision has been replaced by a hyper-organized, capitalist, and infantilizing system where only “organization” drones thrive. In fact, college has not really changed since the sixties, even less so than when he went to school, and it really is not as bad as he suggests. I know only one of my contemporaries who is dissatisfied with college, and that is because his school is 85% male. Overwhelmingly, my generation is having a great time at college, experiencing independence, responsibility, social awareness, and activism like never before in our lives. Mr. Perlstein overlooks that the sixties’ values he misses are still part of the college experience, but these values are expressed differently by a new generation.

2007-09-24,iCollege,"Rick Perlstein is right. College as America used to understand it is coming to an end, but for a different reason. Perlstein’s article “What’s the Matter with College” describes this issue, but it fails to look at the underlying cause. From my opinion as a current college student, I blame technology. Iphones, ipods, and social sites like Facebook and Youtube are destroying the sense of community on the college campus. I know, because I’ve watched students’ infatuation with these devices lead them to choose the company of their computer screens and earplugs over that of the physical eyes and ears of their friends.

The advent of technology and the exponential increase in ideological marketing dilute the originality and space for critical thought that is the essence of college life.

Next to them is a brilliantly red photograph of unidentifiable gore labeled “Planned Parenthood.” As if the visual implication were not enough, those manning the billboards are shouting their message: They are the Genocide Awareness Project, and they are on my campus telling me, yelling in my face as I pass by, that abortion is genocide.

Most of my classmates headed to elite institutions on the East Coast, to tiny private colleges through the Midwest, or to research departments in California. I was the only student who packed up my bags to head to the big state school: The Ohio State University. I did not know what to expect: would my classes have twenty students or two hundred, where would my roommate be from, and would I even be able graduate in four years?

College used to be regarded as a privilege for those who can afford it until recently it has started to be regarded and expected of students to go to college right after high school. Before students go to college and discover it for themselves, they have grandiose ideas conjured in their minds of classes, meeting new people and liberty formerly unknown to them, but what these students don’t realize at first is why they are going to college. Some students may just be at college because they are doing what they are told or going because they want to get into graduate school. But the unwritten result of going to college and why college matters is because it transforms them from children into adults and throughout the whole transformation process the students will have learned more about themselves more than ever before.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/why-college-matters-22/

2007-09-24,My College Experience as I Didn’t Plan it,"Whether college is more or less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago depends on who you ask, so the best way for me to approach the question is to describe how critical my college experience has been to me. I think that although the keys to the kingdom of college have survived the generations, the doors seem to have moved; where _Tropic of Capricorn_ may have gotten Doug Mitchell into college in the 1960’s, I maintain that Henry Miller’s other _Tropic_ saved me from it. I discovered _Tropic of Cancer_ in the summer of 2005, when two years of bewildering social and intellectual impotence at the University of Pittsburgh had left me frustrated and misplaced. I had run from high school to college in the earnest pursuit of truth, but had not to stay long before worrying that maybe in spite of my hunger for knowledge, I was not the university type after all. Although I initially flew at college with the intensity of a laser beam, a quick “Freshman Studies” brainwashing on the value of a “liberal arts education” was all it took to scatter the force of my curiosity on impact. I had been anxious to jump right in and see what Philosophy was all about, but my advisers at Pitt, operating under a liberal arts theory, prescribed intellectually dilute yet logistically overwhelming schedules for underclassmen – a tight regimen of dabbling – that I think prevented me from ever really taking root in the Philosophy Department. I can’t say it was all bad; I did put some solid work into English, for example, which was a critical step in establishing my academic direction. But two years is a long time to feel like an outsider in one’s major department, and when those beaming study-abroad veterans regaled my foreign language class with tales of life-changing journeys of self-discovery overseas, I considered study abroad not only as a temporary escape from my frustrations, but as an opportunity to see how Philosophy worked at another university. So, passing over the glossy pamphlets advertising Pitt-affiliated abroad programs, I opted instead for a direct enrollment with University College London.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/my-college-experience-as-i-didnt-plan-it/

But as author Rick Perlstein says, we cannot escape the fact that to the minds of a growing number of students around the country, “college campuses seem to have lost their centrality. Why do college and college students no longer lead the culture?” In fact as more and more students pursue a university education, the question of why they do so at all must take on a new significance for those who care about education. For as we shall see, the fact that students are becoming increasingly unhappy with their college experience suggests that the very concept of education is changing and that we are losing sight of its true value.",Magazine,https://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/excessive-practicality/

Each day’s card will be tied to a different song; among the artists involved are Bob Dylan, Dave Matthews, KT Tunstall, above, and Band of Horses.

Mr. Wagner has said he is ready to step down as head of the festival, an annual celebration of Richard Wagner’s works, but only if Katharina, right, succeeds him. Besides Katharina, 29, who is Mr. Wagner’s daughter from his second marriage, the post is being sought by Eva Wagner-Pasquier, 62, Mr. Wagner’s daughter from his first marriage, and Nike Wagner, 62, his niece. Referring to Mr. Thielemann, 48, a leading Wagner interpreter and music director of the Munich Philharmonic, Katharina Wagner told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, “We have decided to run as a team.” And Mr. Thielemann said: “We know each other so well, we can tell each other our opinions without holding back. Apart from that, we would be exactly the right age for a new era.” Ms. Wagner noted in the interview that the current Bayreuth leadership has signed contracts with artists as far ahead as 2015, meaning that until then, any new leadership would essentially be administering Mr. Wagner’s legacy. Referring to Eva and Nike, she said, “Before they had their hands free for their own planning, they would be well above retirement age.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/arts/music/24arts-FRESHTURNINB_BRF.html

2007-09-24,Paying Homage to Anti-Hitler Plotters,"Tom Cruise and the crew of “Valkyrie” observed a minute of silence on Friday night as they prepared to film at the site in Berlin where Germans who plotted to assassinate Hitler were executed in 1944 , The Associated Press reported yesterday. Christian Berkel, who portrays one of the plotters, Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag: “Shortly before we started filming, screenplay writer Christopher McQuarrie, director Bryan Singer and Tom Cruise made short remarks and then asked for a minute of silence — out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of the people who were executed there. It was a very moving moment.” Mr. Cruise plays Col. Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, who was executed at the Bendler Block, which serves as part of the German defense ministry and as a memorial for those who resisted the Nazi regime. The German government initially refused permission to film “Valkyrie” there, leading to speculation that it had denied access because Mr. Cruise is a Scientologist. The government, which denied the accusation, regards Scientology as a dangerous cult.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/movies/24arts-PAYINGHOMAGE_BRF.html

The Germans are sending Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel — but other countries and the European Union are sending officials with far less weighty portfolios.The EU will be represented by Humberto Rosa, the deputy environment minister of Portugal. Stavros Dimas, the EU’s environment commissioner, is giving the meeting a miss to ensure that the focus for climate change talks stays at the United Nations and on a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December. The British government is sending Phil Woolas rather than its environment minister, Hilary Benn.“There are a number of cocktail parties leading up to the ball in Bali in December, and the meeting in Washington next week is one of them,” a spokeswoman for Britain’s department for the environment told me.“Green” Europe may be right to snub America over climate change. After all Europeans have been busy implementing the Kyoto Protocol while the Americans have dawdled. What’s the point of Europeans endorsing a gathering in Washington if Americans don’t yet favor binding targets?But Europe still has a lot of work ahead getting its own house in order. A number of EU countries have failed to meet the modest emissions-reduction targets under Kyoto while newer EU members are resisting future targets, saying they should have a chance to industrialize first so they can reach western European standards of living.Major European industries, including carmakers like Volkswagen, protest that new targets are too onerous. European policy makers also differ on the best way to persuade fast-developing countries to sign a new global treaty.With Europe presenting a somewhat fragmented front, the best hope for bringing China and India into a future treaty probably still remains a unilateral move by the United States to cut emissions. That’s unlikely to happen under the Bush administration. So while talks in Washington this week could through up interesting ideas don’t expect any real breakthroughs until 2009, when a new U.S. president takes office.

2007-09-24,"Now, Milan","Fashion used to come in phases; the Japanese economy was in a rut, hence a dearth of Japanese shoppers on the Via Della Spiga. The dollar was up, the dollar was down. These were short-term occurrences that people, in Italy above all, learned to accept without interest. Now, however, fashion appears to be entering longer, less predictable chapters. There are the new, unjaded consumers from Russia and the Far East. Should it surprise anyone that Vivienne Westwood, the former punk rebel and subject of a retrospective here, has 15 shops in Hong Kong and five in Moscow? There is the growing acceptance, not just in the United States but here in Europe, for all kinds of cosmetic surgery. The quest for “perfect” bodies and youth-enhanced faces is bound to have an impact on the look of fashion. It’s all I kept noticing on the streets of Milan over the weekend: tight women, aged 25 to 45, in their tight fashionable clothes. And there are the new fashion capitalists, the investors and private-equity funds like Permira in England, which owns the Valentino Fashion Group. Have they supplanted designers in power and influence?

The show, presented off Broadway in 2004, is currently playing at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle, where it has received mixed reviews. Over the past few weeks, Mr. Quaid’s wife, Evi Quaid, said, there had been backstage bickering between the Quaids and one of the show’s producers, Ed Burke. Mr. Quaid had negotiated an unusually high degree of creative approval for the show, and there were disagreements about his interpretation of his character, who is based on Falstaff. “How do you take a fornicator, an adulterer, an alcoholic and an identity thief and make a family show around him?” Mr. Quaid said in a telephone interview yesterday. Bob Boyett, one of the producers, said the decision to cancel the Broadway engagement was made by all of the producers and the creative team, not just Mr. Burke. “The reason is,” he said, “we just feel that the show is not yet ready.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/theater/25arts-NOBROADWAYOU_BRF.html

2007-09-26,Trenton: Abortion Malpractice Appeal,"A woman has asked the State Supreme Court to reconsider its unanimous ruling to dismiss her malpractice lawsuit concerning her 1996 abortion. The woman, Rosa Acuna, 40, of Bound Brook, filed court papers late Monday. Her lawyer, Harold Cassidy, asked the court to reconsider what he called “very clear errors” in the court’s decision regarding a doctor’s responsibility to answer patient questions, whether or not the case should be heard by a jury, and disagreements among expert witnesses over when human life begins. In her suit, Ms. Acuna said she would not have had the abortion if she had received proper answers to her questions. The court ruled that her doctor had “no legal duty” to tell her that her 6-to-8-week-old embryo was “a complete, separate, unique and irreplaceable human being.”",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/nyregion/26mbrfs-abortion.html

2007-09-26,Painting Guggenheim Wrights Color,"Nearly 50 years after Frank Lloyd Wright chose a paint chip for the color of his beloved Guggenheim Museum, New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission agreed to consider the museum's request for the correct hue to be applied to the 1959 building. The museum is seeking the commission’s permission to paint the exterior in Benjamin Moore HC-35, an egg-finish shade recommended by outside conservation experts, as they found it was the closest match to a paint chip that was signed by Wright and stamped July 24, 1958. The commission’s approval is needed because of the Guggenheim’s status as a protected landmark and its location in the Carnegie Hill historic district. Experts say the building’s original coat was supposed to be the darkest of three samples of a color called Cocoon. Instead, the building was coated in the lightest of the three Cocoon samples, with no clear explanation, the landmarks commission said. A thorough analysis of the museum’s finish has revealed as many as 12 coats of paint, including four grayish-white layers applied since 1992; four buff layers applied from the 1960s back to the 1950s; the original light Cocoon; and, finally, the blue primer. According to the analysis, Wright’s intent was always to coat the building in an egg finish. “He apparently hated white,” said Elisabeth de Bourbon, a commission spokeswoman.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/arts/design/26arts-PAINTINGGUGG_BRF.html

Daniela Rizzo, a prosecution witness, described a visit she made in 2001 to the Getty as part of an Italian delegation gathering evidence for the case. She said Ms. True was “very collaborative” in discussing potential Italian claims and archaeological projects. “We talked at length — I saw this as positive,” Ms. Rizzo testified. “She was obviously very concerned and sorrowed.” Franco Coppi, who heads Ms. True’s Italian defense team, said that the agreement had “knocked the drama out of the trial.” Although the criminal charges remain, a lawyer for the Italian government said in court that Italy would formally drop civil charges against Ms. True in January. A prosecutor, Paolo Ferri, said in an interview that he hoped that lesser criminal charges against her could now be negotiated. “I’m hoping to close the trial without losing another two years,” he said. The trial opened in 2005.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/arts/design/27arts-GETTYPACTAPP_BRF.html

2007-10-01,Re-engineering Engineering,"WHEN NONENGINEERS THINK ABOUT ENGINEERING, it’s usually because something has gone wrong: collapsing levees in New Orleans, the loss of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003. In the follow-up investigations, it comes out that some of the engineers involved knew something was wrong. But too few spoke up or pushed back — and those who did were ignored. This professional deficiency is something the new, tuition-free Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering wants to fix. At its tiny campus in Needham, Mass., outside Boston, Olin is trying to design a new kind of engineer. Most engineering schools stress subjects like differential calculus and physics, and their graduates tend to end up narrowly focused and likely to fit the stereotype of a socially awkward clock-puncher. Richard K. Miller, the president of the school, likes to share a professional joke: “How can you tell an extroverted engineer? He’s the one who looks at your shoes when he talks to you.” Olin came into being, Miller told me last spring in his office on campus, to make engineers “comfortable as citizens and not just calculating machines.” Olin is stressing creativity, teamwork and entrepreneurship — and, in no small part, courage. “I don’t see how you can make a positive difference in the world,” he emphasized, “if you’re not motivated to take a tough stand and do the right thing.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30OLIN-t.html

Then in the ’80s, I was a divorced, single parent of two girls who were about to go off to college. I was getting very anxious; it was a classic case of empty-nest syndrome. And then somehow I thought: Well, what the hell? I might as well go to college, too. So that’s what I did, at age 45.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30Lives-t.html

But in Britain, Wright has returned with a tell-all memoir, “Spilling the Beans,” that is No. 1 on The Times of London’s nonfiction best-seller list. Wright has plenty of stories to tell, beginning with those of her father, a surgeon to the royal family. (She recounts the time she had sex behind the speaker’s chair in Parliament with an unnamed M.P. and talks about, as The Daily Telegraph put it, “her 12-year inheritance-squandering binge” — not a phrase one hears often enough.) Interviewed in The Daily Mail, Wright gave this unlikely bit of advice: “You should learn to cook puddings. Men like puddings.” About Wright’s heft, The Daily Mail’s interviewer comments: “It wasn’t the alcohol that damaged her health. It was the quinine in the tonic water she added to her gin — two pints of gin a day for 12 years, which I calculate as roughly 9,000 pints of gin and over 50,000 pints of tonic water. The quinine destroyed her adrenal gland, and now she can’t lose weight, even if she lived on lettuce — which I doubt she ever would.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/30tbr.html

At the time, four-star generals in the United States Army may have had 150,000 or 200,000 troops under their command. Poor Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander, was accountable for a staggering 2.8 million. Dutifully he waited for status reports about how his 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne were faring. Prepared for bad news, he had written a press statement placing the blame squarely on his shoulders. If Operation Overlord came to failure, he’d take the sword. After eight and a half hours, with the secret invasion going well, Eisenhower’s press aide, Col. Ernest Dupuy, issued a simple 26-word statement: “Under the command of General Eisenhower, Allied naval forces, supported by strong air forces, began landing Allied armies this morning on the northern coast of France.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/Brinkley-t.html

2007-10-01,Liam’s Wake,"Reckless intelligence, savage humor, slow revelation, no consolation: Anne Enright’s fiction is jet dark — but how it glitters. Her prose often ravishes and sometimes repels: reading her can be like staring into the lustrous surface of a lake, trying to discern the dangers lurking beneath. Toward the end of her second novel, “What Are You Like?,” the ghost of Anna Kennedy, an Irishwoman who died in childbirth, remembers when she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl and a nun gave her a German sentence to translate: “Neither childhood nor the future will diminish.” That charged prophecy fills and refills Enright’s pen.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

2007-10-01,Onward Christian Scholars,"EVERY FRIDAY AFTERNOON in Moscow, Idaho, a strange commotion overruns Main Street. A stream of young men and women parade down the sidewalk, wearing black academic gowns that billow and flap as they walk. Some pore over Latin textbooks or thumb flashcards of ancient Greek vocabulary, nearly tripping at the curb. They are students at New St. Andrews College on their way to disputatio, a weekly assembly held in a movie theater downtown. The college itself has no room large enough to accommodate all 150 students at once: it occupies a single unassuming brick building a few blocks away, one that a stranger might mistake for the refurbished husk of an old savings and loan. Passers-by on their way to the Pita Pit or Hodgins Drug barely give the students a second glance. Not a few residents, however, have fought hard to keep them out of downtown. Founded in 1994 by the elders of a fast-growing and radically conservative church, New St. Andrews represents a new philosophy of evangelical education — one that has inspired a national movement and makes local liberals nervous.

2007-10-01,Tense Times at Bronxville High,"IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING last Halloween, Maria Devlin and her mother, Donna, were both wide awake in their apartment in Bronxville, N.Y., scanning an essay that shared Maria’s most profound thoughts on “one or two of her principal intellectual interests.” The buzz from what had become, of late, a 10 p.m. ritual hot chocolate — part soothing balm, part energizing caffeine — had come and gone. Now they were struggling to focus on proofreading that essay as well as some other college application forms due to be mailed the next day. On photocopied pages, they practiced squeezing Maria’s many accomplishments — National Merit semifinalist, area all-state flutist (honor ensemble), numerous playwriting awards — into the too-small lines scattered throughout the page. Once Maria’s mother found a way to make it all fit, with abbreviations and tiny, neat letters, Maria would commit the list to the official page in clean, precise writing. Around 2 in the morning, a friend sent Maria an e-mail message: What are you doing? Maria told her and fired back the same question. A.P. American history, the friend wrote. Gotcha, wrote Maria. She had already aced her Advanced Placement exams in American history, world history and French, not to mention calculus, a class she took her junior year, one of only four students in her grade at Bronxville High School to do so. It was accomplishments like that, as well as her near-perfect SATs, her near-perfect G.P.A., her in-progress novel and her natural gifts as a studio artist that put Maria, then 17, in line for the scholarship for which she was applying.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30neurosis-t.html

2007-10-01,A View of the Bosporus," ORHAN PAMUK takes the pundit’s dry talk of a “clash of civilizations” and gives it a human face, turns it on its head and sends it spinning wildly. In his early novel “The White Castle,” a Venetian slave and his Ottoman master swap clothes, exchange ideas and squabble like siblings until you can no longer tell who is who — or who’s on top. “I enjoy sitting at my desk,” Pamuk told The Paris Review, in an interview included in his new book, “like a child playing with his toys.” This gift for taking the urgent issues of the day and presenting them as detective stories that race past like footfalls down an alleyway has made Pamuk the best-selling writer in the history of his native Turkey and the deserving winner of last year’s Nobel Prize in Literature, at the unvenerable age of 54. Serving up 16th-century murder stories that investigate shifts in the history of Islamic art and offering us seriously entertaining wild goose tales that ask the deepest questions about identity, Pamuk is that rarest of creatures, a fabulist of ideas.

2007-10-01,‘Run’," Bernadette had been dead two weeks when her sisters showed up in Doyle's living room asking for the statue back. They had no legal claim to it, of course, she never would have thought of leaving it to them, but the statue had been in their family for four generations, passing down a maternal line from mother to daughter, and it was their intention to hold with tradition. Bernadette had no daughters. In every generation there had been an uncomfortable moment when the mother had to choose between her children as there was only one statue and these Irish Catholic families were large. The rule in the past had always been to give it to the girl who most resembled the statue, and among Bernadette and her siblings, not that the boys ever had a chance, Bernadette was the clear winner: iron rust hair, dark blue eyes, a long, narrow nose. It was frankly unnerving at times how much the carving looked like Bernadette, as if she had at some point modeled in a blue robe with a halo stuck to the back of her head.

Bishop Gerardi's stories were famously amusing and sometimes off-color. He had a reputation as a chistoso, a joker. ""In a meeting with him, you would get this whole repertoire of jokes,"" Father Mario Orantes Nájera, the parish's assistant priest, told police investigators two days later. ""I wish you could have known him."" Guatemalans admire someone who can tell chistes. A good chiste is, among other things, a defense against fear, despair, and the loneliness of not daring to speak your mind. In the most tense, uncomfortable, or frightening circumstances, a Guatemalan always seems to come forward with a chiste or two, delivered with an almost formal air, often in a recitative rush of words, the emphasis less in the voice, rarely raised, than in the hand gestures. Even when laughter is forced, it seems like a release. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/chapters/0930-1st-gold.html

2007-10-01,"Brutes, Galoots and Thugs","THERE’S nothing more wonderful in literature than when a writer makes us feel deeply for a distasteful character. And there’s nothing more hateful in literature than when a writer goes out of his way to make sure we know he’s better — smarter, more sensitive, less boorish — than the characters he’s writing about. The Scottish writer Irvine Welsh’s “If You Liked School, You’ll Love Work …” is a collection of short stories (his first since “The Acid House” in 1995 ) largely about lamebrained men and the women who turn their heads — not a bad subject by itself, necessarily. But Welsh is the kind of writer who floats above the world scribbling passionately in his notebook, observing with great fascination the direction less, antlike creatures below him. He’s a wry observer but rarely a sympathizer: he’s happy to describe the flaws of his fictional creations, but mostly, he seems happy he’s not them.

Buruma, who was born in the Netherlands but has lived mostly abroad for the past 30 years, has made a career of analyzing foreign cultures. Here he returns to his native land to examine the 2004 murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh. A Dutch-born Islamist of Moroccan descent shot van Gogh, angry at “Submission,” a film he had made with the Somali-born feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali about the treatment of women under Islam. Buruma tries to understand why the Dutch multi cultural experiment has not gone well, despite the government’s liberal immigration policies and lavish social services. More important than Islam’s influence, Buruma suggests, is “the question of authority … in a society from which a young Moroccan male might find it easier to receive subsidies than respect.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/0930bb-paperback.html

Here is a much larger collection of letters than could fit in the print edition.Re “Betraying Its Own Best Interests” (Sept. 23):I’ve supported and donated to MoveOn.org in the past, and I’ve opposed the Iraq war since before Day 1, but when I saw the ad, I was appalled.I grew up during the McCarthy years and remember what it was like to hear people like George Marshall routinely being accused of betrayal. Funny thing about mud, it smells exactly the same whether it’s being hurled from the left or the right.That said, I do wonder whether you’re right in suggesting that the Times should have forced MoveOn.org to lose the “Betray Us” line as a condition of publication.It’s my impression that the First Amendment protects, among other things, our right to make perfect fools of ourselves, and I’m not sure The Times should be in the business of shielding political groups (or anyone else) from exposing themselves to richly justified ridicule.It would have been far better to publish the ad as submitted, while running an editorial, on the same day if possible, properly taking MoveOn.org to task for its savage characterization of an honorable soldier trying to make the best of an impossible mission.
