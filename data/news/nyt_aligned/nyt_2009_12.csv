A department member decided that the letter “was an attack on the Maori people and thus racist,” and even when it was determined that it is not the Maori, but “white hippies, who go barefoot in New Zealand, the majority voted against pursuing the candidate in order, says Nelson, to prove “themselves to colleagues of color.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/political-correctness-revisited-views-from-both-sides/

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 1 percent annualized gain, based on the median of 19 responses. The second-quarter decrease, initially reported at 3.4 percent, was revised to a 3.1 percent annualized decline. The third-quarter figure is lower than the Bank of Canada’s prediction for 2 percent annualized growth. Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada, said last month the growth could come in “softer” than his formal prediction, adding the “profile” for a strengthening recovery next year remains intact. “There is reason to be optimistic that growth will build for the fourth quarter” from today’s “fairly weak return to positive growth,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, citing the gain in domestic spending.

2009-12-01,Double dip warning,"I’ve never been fully committed to the notion that we’re going to have a “double dip” — that the economy will slide back into recession. But it has been clear for a while that it’s a serious possibility, for two reasons. First, a large part of the growth we’ve had has been driven by the stimulus — but the stimulus has already had its maximum impact on the growth of GDP, will hit its maximum impact on the level of GDP in the middle of next year, and then will begin to fade out. Second, the rise in manufacturing production is to a large extent an inventory bounce — and this, too, will fade out in the quarters ahead.

Julian Casablancas, the front man of the Strokes, told Billboard that the group would headline the Isle of Wight festival in Britain on June 12, alongside Jay-Z; the performance will likely be followed by other summer concert appearances in Europe and North America. “When we meet with the band and talk and play music, it’s just a different level of ease and comfort,” Mr. Casablancas told Billboard. “Everyone’s more easygoing and everyone feels more confident and just trusts each other a little bit.” Mr. Casablancas is promoting a new solo album, “Phrazes for the Young.” The Strokes 2001 debut, “Is This It,” was critically well received, but the albums “Room on Fire” (in 2003) and “First Impressions of Earth” drew weaker responses.

The company also said it had eliminated eight positions in its business and artistic departments and had frozen salaries and suspended its retirement-plan contributions for employees. Additionally, employees will take a one-week furlough in the last week of the year, with additional rolling furloughs expected in the spring. The opera’s president, Kenneth R. Feinberg, said the company had achieved balanced budgets for two straight years, partly because of contributions from “a few exceptionally generous donors.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/arts/music/02arts-WASHINGTONOP_BRF.html
2009-12-02,New Theory Offered on Jane Austen’s Death,"A British medical researcher believes she has answered the longstanding question of what killed Jane Austen  and it wasn’t her foreboding of today’s wave of Austen-horror mashup books. The Guardian reported that Katherine G. White of the Addison’s Disease Self-Help Group has written an article for Medical Humanities magazine in which she says that Austen probably died of tuberculosis caught from cattle. Ms. White examined correspondence from Austen, who died in 1817 at age 41, as well as recollections from her family, and concluded that she probably did not die of Addison’s disease or lymphoma, as medical researchers and biographers have speculated. “While lymphoma would be one possible cause of the exhaustion, recurrent fever, bilious attacks and rheumatic pains described by Austen,” Ms. White wrote, “disseminated tuberculosis affecting the joints and liver  probably of bovine origin  would offer a simpler explanation.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/books/02arts-NEWTHEORYOFF_BRF.html

Variety reported that Mr. Greengrass, the British director (“Bloody Sunday”) of the series’ two most recent installments, “The Bourne Supremacy” and “The Bourne Ultimatum”, said he would not take part in a fourth Bourne movie. “My decision to not return a third time as director is simply about feeling the call for a different challenge,” Mr. Greengrass said in a statement reported by Variety. “There’s been no disagreement with Universal Pictures. The opportunity to work with the Bourne family again is a difficult thing to pass up, but we have discussed this together and they have been incredibly understanding and supportive.” The continued involvement of the actor Matt Damon, who has played Bourne in the movies, was also uncertain. Mr. Damon and Mr. Greengrass also worked together on “Green Zone,” a war drama that Universal plans to release next year.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/paul-greengrass-parts-ways-with-bourne-films/

Recently, it hosted the lo-fi exhibit “Lynchmob,” in which three dozen local artists riffed on all things David Lynch. Last weekend, after giving the place a serious scrub — but being careful to preserve the wood-paneled walls and the all-around grit — Stephan Rothfuss and Johannes Schoen reintroduced .HBC (now with a period) as a high-profile cultural hub, a crossroads for Berlin’s artists, thinkers, designers and assorted stylistas. The multilevel space houses studios for Olafur Ericsson’s students at the Berlin University of the Arts along with three bars, including one that serves only absinthe. Plastic furniture by the cult designer Jerszy Seymour dots the rooms, and on the ceiling is a neon light installation by the collective Assume Vivid Astro Focus. “They really cleaned this place up,” said the Berlin-based fashion designer Jen Gilpin at the opening party. “But thankfully not too much.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/night-crawling-berlins-culture-club/

And yet McGovern’s others advisers unanimously rejected the Cronkite gamble, not just because they feared he would say no but also because the boundary between journalism and elective office was so absolute that the thought of merging them struck aides as too desperate a ploy.

2009-12-03,Design Miami 2009 | Conceptual Healing,"MIAMI — Design Miami 2009, a relatively small but jampacked fair this year, is open for business. The exhibiting galleries’ booths seemed tightly focused, with less emphasis on the wow factor and more on concept. Swarovski’s, for instance, was downright abstract. In place of its usual designer chandeliers, Gregg Lynn created three sail-like forms — made of the lightweight but strong carbon-fiber and Mylar sandwich that is used to make actual sails — and added thousands of tiny Swarovski crystals that gave the forms a subtle glimmer. At Gallery Libby Sellers, Julia Lohmann and Gero Grundmann took animal bones found along the banks of the Thames River in London and, with interventions like silver inserts to hold candles or flowers, turned them into precious objects.

The Rodin Museum and Versailles were also affected, though much of Versailles was open to visitors. Most of the Louvre was open too, though some rooms were shut, and the entry price was cut by a third for the day. The museums were expected to remain closed on Thursday. The strike was begun by conservationists at the Pompidou Center because of government plans to replace any two civil servants who retired with only one new hire. The rule applies to all government departments, an effort to reduce a huge state work force that largely has guaranteed jobs for life and handsome state pensions.

The city council of King Township, north of Toronto, voted 6-1 to designate the work, completed in 1972, and some of the land around it as a protected cultural landscape under the Ontario Heritage Act, over the objections of the land’s owner, Hickory Hills Investments. The township’s mayor, Margaret Black, said that while she respected property rights, she felt the importance of the sculpture “overrides that,” The Toronto Globe and Mail reported, adding that the council had never before granted protected status to any property without the property owner’s consent. The development company, which has plans to build housing on land near the sculpture, had offered to promise in writing that it would not “harm, alter or destroy” the work, but council members decided that more comprehensive protection was needed. Reached Wednesday morning, Mr. Serra, above, who built the piece on what was then an isolated cornfield owned by an art collector, said he was elated by the decision to protect a sculpture he considers crucial in the development of his work. He said he had not visited the work since the late 1970s but might do so now. “I think at least it’s a great initial move,” he said, “and we’ll see what happens now.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/arts/design/03arts-SERRAWORKINO_BRF.html

The clips, which range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, were chosen by several dozen film buffs who have been working over the last year to snag must-see moments from studio libraries. Zach James, who, with the former Los Angeles Film Festival director Rich Raddon, founded a private company that operates the new site, said he expected the site to generate advertising revenue, which would be shared with the studios providing the clips. At the same time film companies get a shot at selling DVDs or streamed versions of their backlists through links to Amazon or iTunes.

Tonight Mr. Domínguez will lead an “explosive ensemble”  with several percussionists, including the dancer and palmero (hand clapper) known as Tomasito in “The Flamenco Side of ‘Kind of Blue’ ” at the Jazz Standard.

He died in 1996. A third candidate, a banjo and guitar player from Scranton, Pa., Robert Degen, was generally unknown, but he and a partner, Joe Brier, copyrighted a song called “The Hokey Pokey Dance” in 1944, five years before Mr. LaPrise and his musical group, the Ram Trio, recorded their own, very similar version.

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when federal lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restricted, but the film business is putting out more unrated DVDs that may contain material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for display in theaters. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a survey of shoppers by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising. The gaming industry, the report said, has “the strongest self-regulatory code” and has generally good compliance with its standards.

2009-12-04,Not Quite Holiday Films for Not Quite Happy Times," Made-for-television holiday movies usually put modern-day twists on Christmas classics: Scrooge as an ill-tempered talk show host, a working mom in the role of George Bailey in a 1977 version of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Many of this year’s holiday offerings bypass the canon entirely. Instead they throw a perfunctory ribbon around plotlines pilfered from works like “Pride and Prejudice” and “All About Eve.” The coming days are the peak of holiday treacle, but these specials are a subgenre suited to a time of cutbacks and compromise: the Christmas-ish television movie.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for ABC confirmed that the “Jimmy Kimmel” booking had been canceled, saying, “We decided not to move forward with the booking at this time.” The network said it had not announced its performers for the New Year’s Eve program. Last week ABC scratched a planned appearance by Mr. Lambert on “Good Morning America,” its morning talk show. That decision stemmed from Mr. Lambert’s performance on Nov. 22 at the American Music Awards, also broadcast on ABC, during which he simulated sex acts with his dancers, kissed a male band mate and extended his middle finger to the camera.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/television/04arts-FORABCADAMLA_BRF.html

2009-12-04,Fashion,"Writing in Vogue in 1978, Susan Sontag identified Richard Avedon’s fashion photography as symptomatic of the recent historical shift whereby “fashion” had ceased to refer to elegant conduct (“general deportment, etiquette, style of speech, diction, accent”) and had come instead to mean surface refinement alone. “Fashion,” she observed, “has become something that is almost entirely visual — that is, photographic. As fashion becomes pure appearance, it finds its perfect summing-up in photographs.” As applied to Avedon, the key word is “perfect,” for the exquisite stylization of his compositions produces a world of ethereal, almost impossible beauty. By way of an example, Sontag noted that “it would be as easy to identify with the woman in Avedon’s 1953 photograph of Marella Agnelli as with a Brancusi statue.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/books/review/WeberVogue-t.html

The developing world has made extraordinary strides in reducing measles deaths, with Africa cutting them by more than 90 percent since 2000.

But in hindsight it rings hollow, because as astonishing cities go, Paris could give any place in the universe a run for its money. And this is in no small part due to Louis XIV (whose contributions to the capital include the Champs-Élysées, the Invalides and the Tuileries) and his predecessors and successors. From the Capetian kings’ Cathedral of Notre-Dame to François Mitterrand’s I. M.

Wright II of the United States District Court for the Central District of California has had some interesting bedtime reading over the past few months. Before dismissing a plagiarism case brought by the author Jordan Scott against Stephenie Meyer, above, the author of the blockbuster best-selling “Twilight” series, Judge Wright (or his clerks) had to read both “Breaking Dawn,” the fourth and final (we think) installment in the “Twilight” series, and “The Nocturne,” Ms. Scott’s novel, the first in a projected trilogy, to make extensive comparisons. Ms. Scott had suggested that because of similarities in the novels, involving a wedding, a consummation scene on the beach and a subsequent childbirth, that Ms. Meyer had copied Ms. Scott’s work. In a decision filed late last month, Judge Wright ruled that the novels were “not substantially similar as a matter of law” and admonished Ms. Scott for her “deceptive presentation of the alleged similarities.” Among the judge’s many detailed comparisons, he found that the dialogue in both books was substantially different. The speech in “The Nocturne,” he wrote, is “an amalgamation of largely archaic and some modern language that is likely unparalleled in either classical or modern literature.” By contrast, the dialogue in “Breaking Dawn,” he wrote, “maintains a very modern and fresh tone throughout the story that is appealing to a younger audience.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04arts-JUDGERULESIN_BRF.html

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restrictive, but that the film industry is putting out more unrated DVDs that may include material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for theatrical release. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a shopper survey by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising. The gaming industry, the report said, has “the strongest self-regulatory code,” and has generally strong compliance with its standards.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04arts-REPORTFAULTS_BRF.html

As a result, he wound up the most influential progenitor of much that is spectacular, vulgar, cheerfully phony and just plain fun about American popular culture. He’s not only one of the founders of the circus that still bears his name, but he’s also a direct ancestor of everything from Bat Boy in the Weekly World News to all those pseudoscience shows on the History Channel like “MonsterQuest” to the careers of such enterprising vulgarians and spectaclemongers as D. W. Griffith, Jerry Bruckheimer and the creators of reality television.

These forces are “special” as in “Mama says I’m special” — the unstop­pable American soldier Zone is severely autistic, which is why he’s so good at following orders. And the story’s plot, it gradually becomes clear, proceeds from the premise that every lie the Bush administration told about the war was true. So terrorists declare, “We hate your freedom”; felons forced into military service become brave tactical geniuses who wouldn’t dream of hurting children; and Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are not only real but concealed in an oil refinery, where Americans would never think to look because of course the war wasn’t about oil.

Learning of the demand overseas for CDs and DVDs, Mr. Schrey started an online business through which a customer could mail in a CD library and receive an iPod, iPhone or other device based on the size of the collection. (An iPod can be had for 200 discs; more ground rules are at ipodmeister.com.) Last month the venture rented a 4,000-square-foot loft with a loading dock and a waiting room.

Mr. Polanski is wanted in the United States; he fled in 1978 before being sentenced for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. A crowd of some 200 journalists had gathered behind a police cordon in the resort to await Mr. Polanski at his luxury chalet. Reporters said he arrived and drove into an underground garage without commenting. In a statement the Swiss government said: “Roman Polanski was today released from custody pending extradition and transferred to Gstaad, where he is under house arrest at his chalet. Polanski has undertaken not to leave his house and property at any time.” The Swiss authorities initially opposed bail for Mr. Polanski after his Sept. 26 arrest because of fears that he might flee. A court and the Justice Ministry eventually accepted his appeal for release on condition that he post bail, yield all travel and identity documents to the police and wear an electronic monitoring device.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/movies/05arts-POLANSKIBEGI_BRF.html
2009-12-07,"McCarthy’s Typewriter Sells for $254,500","The little typewriter that clacked out about five million fairly renowned words over 50 years  with the able assistance of the novelist Cormac McCarthy  ended up being worth a lot more than anyone expected. The heavily weathered, light blue Lettera 32 Olivetti manual machine, below, that Mr. McCarthy said he bought in 1963 for $50 and used to type all his novels, including those that won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, sold on Friday at Christie’s to an unidentified American collector for $254,500, more than 10 times its high estimate of $20,000. (The price includes Christie’s commission.) The proceeds will be donated to the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit interdisciplinary scientific research organization. Glenn Horowitz, a rare-book dealer who handled the auction for Mr. McCarthy, told The New York Times earlier this week: “When I grasped that some of the most complex, almost otherworldly fiction of the postwar era was composed on such a simple, functional, frail-looking machine, it conferred a sort of talismanic quality to Cormac’s typewriter. It’s as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife.” Mr. McCarthy will not be using the opportunity to go digital after all these years. A friend of his recently bought him a replacement typewriter  the same Olivetti model  for less than $20.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/books/05arts-MCCARTHYSTYP_BRF.html

2009-12-07,‘Altar Boyz’ Will Close,"“Altar Boyz,” one of the longest-running productions to play Off Broadway, will close on Jan. 10, its lead producer, Ken Davenport, said on Friday. “The Off Broadway environment is a very fragile one,” Mr. Davenport said in a telephone interview. “After two, three years, we’ve been watching every box office number we could. We’ve just gotten to this point where it’s too risky to keep going.” “Altar Boyz,” a satirical musical about a Christian pop band, above, had its premiere at the New York Musical Theater Festival in 2004 and transferred to New World Stages (then known as Dodger Stages) the next year. At its closing, it will have played 2,032 performances, Mr. Davenport said. Mr. Davenport, a former actor (“Forever Plaid”) who helped develop the musical with his fellow performer Marc Kessler, said “Altar Boyz” had pared expenses to keep the show open. In recent months, Mr. Davenport said, the show was running without a casting director or an outside advertising agency. “It’s a bleak winter,” said Mr. Davenport, who is also a producer of “Oleanna,” which will close on Sunday.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/theater/05arts-ALTARBOYZWIL_BRF.html

And it’s the most extraordinary, sometimes frustrating, place to live.” After defecting to Canada in 1974, he moved to New York, where he was too busy dancing to take English classes — so he learned to speak by watching late-night TV. “I used to say I speak English like I play my guitar: on four chords.” The world’s most famous dancer is also a photographer who’s fixated, predictably, on capturing bodies in motion. A book of his photographs, “Dominican Moves,” comes out this month. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/mikhail-baryshnikov-dancer/

2009-12-08,"Art Basel Miami 2009 | After Performa, the Show Goes On","For the last year or so, we have seen a growing interest in performance art, which hasn’t been so popular among art groupies since its golden days in the 1970s. Performance art’s comeback follows other art-world trends like photography, a return to painting and the rise of the multimedia installation. And after reading the actor James Franco’s preaching in The Wall Street Journal about the history of performance art and presenting his 20-episode stunt in the soap opera “General Hospital” as an art piece, I cannot wait to see it going mainstream and worldwide.I am not sure what is driving this resurgence: is it a reaction against the excesses of the art market in previous years or an expression of its present crisis in 2009? Is it a form of rejection, an act against art consumption, a sign of fatigue over the art products now available in every fair and biennial in every corner of the world?

Yet that is what arrived on Friday night, when the filmmaker Tamra Davis previewed her new documentary, “Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child,” at the Colony Theater on Lincoln Road.The film, which will premiere next month at the Sundance Film Festival, was a labor of love for Davis, who met the artist in 1983 and, with the screenwriter Becky Johnston, interviewed him on camera two years before his death, at age 27, from a heroin overdose. That was in 1988. Davis then put the footage away until a traveling museum retrospective made it clear that there was little of the actual Basquiat on film. (He played a character role in “Downtown ’81,” and Julian Schnabel’s “Basquiat,” with Jeffrey Wright in the title role, was partly fiction.)",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/art-basel-miami-2009-back-to-basquiat/

This is roughly the opposite of what I intended in this post, but since I was apparently unclear, allow me to clarify. The (unlikely) scenario I spun out, in which a reinvigorated Islam manages a sweeping “transformation of European culture,” with a Ramadan-esque figure playing “a Muslim Saint Paul to the E.U.’s Roman Empire,” is one that I would regard with enormous dismay should it ever come to pass. That’s why I suggested that were such a transformation likely or even plausible, it would merit “the deepest sort of pessimism” about Europe’s future. My point was that any scenario for the wholesale Islamification of Europe seems relatively unlikely at this point; it was not that Islamification is desirable, as the key to the continent’s “spiritual reawakening.” I’ve never believed anything so fatuous, and never will.",Blogs,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/islam-and-europe-cont/

2009-12-08,Marriage and the Recession,"Here’s the glass half-full take on the National Marriage Project’s annual “State of Our Unions” report, which tackles the Great Recession’s impact on American wedlock. As it turns out, the strain of the downturn hasn’t pushed the divorce rate higher; instead, economic stress seems to have made American marriages slightly more stable overall, as couples develop a “new appreciation for the economic and social support that marriage can provide in tough times,” as the study’s lead author, Brad Wilcox, puts it. Americans are also turning thriftier (saving more, cutting down on credit card debt, reviving home-based economies, etc.), which is good news for wedlock, since financial stability correlates with marital stability, and with marital happiness as well. If you squint a little at the data, you could even imagine that the recession, and the adjustments required by long periods of unemployment, might “accelerate the social acceptance of women as equal breadwinners and men as capable parents and homemakers,” as Christine Whalen writes in an accompanying essay, and make the institution of marriage more flexible and resilient in the long run.",Blogs,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/marriage-and-the-recession/

If you can’t get to Hawaii in time (it’s late morning there), you can still watch the world’s most prestigious surfing contest: it’s streaming live at the Quiksilver Web site. It’s not like watching a high-def surfing documentary — in live surfing, you’re mostly looking at people floating in the water waiting for a wave. But there have been some monster waves, and in between a lot of shots of young people in bikinis and board shorts. Kelly Slater, who is in the lead, just finished a shift providing live commentary, and other top surfers are sure to drop by.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/live-from-oahu-the-virtual-wave/

2009-12-09,Leadership Changes at Crown Publishing,"Random House, the world’s largest trade publishing house, announced on Tuesday that it had significantly restructured one of its divisions, the Crown Publishing Group, and that Jenny Frost, president and publisher of that division, was stepping down. The move is part of a reorganization started last year by Markus Dohle, right, Random House’s chairman and chief executive. Mr. Dohle announced plans to separate Crown’s trade publishing units  including general fiction and nonfiction books released under the Crown name, Clarkson Potter cookbooks and titles released by Shaye Areheart Books  from the Random House Audio business and the company’s information unit, which publishes Fodor Travel Guides and Princeton Review guides. Mr. Dohle appointed Maya Mavjee, executive publisher of Doubleday Canada Publishing Group, as president and publisher of the newly restructured Crown Publishing Group. Ms. Mavjee will start on Jan. 1. Reached by telephone on Tuesday, Ms. Frost, a 25-year veteran of Random House, said she was surprised by the decision. “I think that Markus has a different strategic vision,” she said, adding that she would take some time to think about her next career move. “It certainly was not what I was anticipating doing,” she said. During her career, Ms. Frost, 53, has published authors including Alice Hoffman, Deepak Chopra and Erik Larson, as well as cookbooks by Bobby Flay and Rachael Ray.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/books/09arts-LEADERSHIPCH_BRF.html

Agence France-Presse reported that Lady Gaga attended the event at Blackpool’s Opera House clad in a red PVC outfit and played her song “Speechless” on a piano supported by stilts. (Cribbing a line from John Lennon, she began her performance by telling the crowd: “Good evening Blackpool. Let me hear you rattle your jewelry.”) Other performers included Whoopi Goldberg, the comedian Frank Carson and the dance troupe Diversity.

Now the Irish government has made a more numerically quantifiable contribution in the form of a $3.5 million grant that will be used to build a new Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. The announcement was made in Ireland by that country’s foreign minister, Micheal Martin, and confirmed by Christine C. Quinn, the New York City Council speaker. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Ms. Quinn said the new Irish Arts Center would probably be at the institution’s current site, 553 West 51st Street in Clinton. The space hosts exhibitions and educational programs, and is also home to a 99-seat theater, but is not quite as green as it was at its founding in 1972. “Its heart and soul is a total treasure,” Ms. Quinn said. “Its physical shape has not quite kept up.” In addition to the contribution from the Irish government, the City of New York has committed $7.75 million in capital financing for the center, and additional contributions are expected from the federal government and private donors.

Now, as the troubled airline reorganizes after bankruptcy, it is selling many works from that collection, including a few that racked up some serious miles. More than 180 paintings, drawings, prints and other works from the collection were to be auctioned Tuesday night in Rome by Finarte Casa D’Aste, the auction house announced on its Web site, finarte.it.

(Last winter, he went so far as to style his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, apartment like a 1970s rec room.) But nothing has brought him more fame or funds than his Superordinate Antler Lamps. To Miller, the success of a big, expensive ceramic chandelier makes total sense. “A light is the first thing people notice when they walk into a room,” he says, “so you want it to say something, and you’re willing to pay more for it.” With that in mind, Miller has created an as-yet-unnamed lighting firm, with products set to make their debut at next spring’s furniture fair in New York. He will produce his own work and will cherry-pick the best of his colleagues’, like Paul Loebach’s triangulated aluminum Himmeli lights or Sarah Cihat and Michael Miller’s rocker-chic porcelain-and-chain lamps. For now, Miller will be keeping the whole affair stateside, sourcing American designers and local manufacturers.

Chu, the Albert Ferguson associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and director of the Cartilage Restoration Center there, confirmed a theory, and found herself troubled by the results. It turned out that if you dropped a heavy weight onto parts of a cow’s knee joint from various heights, the joint was hurt. (While the parts of the joint were damaged, the cow itself was uninjured by the experiment; the knees came from a local abattoir.) When the weight hit the joint’s surface cartilage with great speed and force, the bone and cartilage fractured. No surprise there. But it is what happened in Dr. Chu’s experiment when the impact was more subtle — closer to, for instance, the perturbations inside a human knee when a ligament is torn — that concerned her. She found that with lighter impact, the various parts of the knee appeared, visually at least, to be fine.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/phys-ed-what-causes-early-arthritis-in-knees/

Ray Nagin, a Democrat who is prevented by term limits from running again. “I have a much better idea of what being a candidate is really like because I’ve done it twice,” Mr. Landrieu said to reporters after the announcement. Asked why he had repeatedly denied plans to run, Mr. Landrieu said that certain things had become clear over the course of the campaign, like who the other candidates were and what kind of campaigns they were running. “I don’t think changing your mind is something that you regret if something comes to you and you feel very strongly about it,” he said.

But, as he explained, “it wasn’t conducive to social interaction, and it certainly wasn’t about the integration of art.” Rather than executing Wright’s original sketches, Kikoski turned the space — most recently a generic cafeteria with brown carpeting — into a modern homage to the legendary architect, who designed the museum to harmonize with the artwork within.

Titles in the delayed schedule include “The High School Reunion Diet” by David Colbert; “Point Omega” by Don DeLillo; “Courage and Consequence” by Karl Rove; and “French Women Don’t Get Fat Cookbook” by Mireille Guiliano. A spokesman for Simon & Schuster, Adam Rothberg, said the company  which previously delayed the e-book release of Stephen King’s “Under the Dome” by several weeks  had noticed that e-book sales were cannibalizing hardcover sales: “We’ve decided that we need to see what happens when we have this e-book sequencing of delaying the e-book for four months and how that affects the hardcover sales and how that affects e-book sales.” Other publishers have also begun to postpone e-book publications. A spokeswoman for Hachette Book Group, which publishes blockbuster authors like James Patterson and Stephenie Meyer, said that starting in January or February the company would delay the e-book release on a wide selection of titles. John Sargent, chief executive of Macmillan, owner of imprints like Farrar, Straus & Giroux and St. Martin’s Press, said the company had already delayed e-book publication on several novels, including those by Janet Evanovich and “The Gathering Storm,” the 12th volume in “The Wheel of Time” series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. In a statement, Amazon.com, which sells e-books on its Kindle reader, said: “Authors get the most publicity at launch and need to strike while the iron is hot.

The first hearing in the case was heard on Nov. 27 in Beijing, when Ma Xuexin, the father of a 20-month-old with a kidney stone, argued that his son fell ill from drinking tainted milk made by the Sanlu Group, a dairy company. Mr. Ma was demanding the equivalent of more than $8,000 in compensation from Sanlu and a supermarket chain. After the milk scandal broke in September 2008, the government said at least six children had died and 300,000 had fallen ill from drinking dairy products tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical. The second hearing in Mr. Ma’s case was postponed because the defendants wanted further investigation into ties between the dairy product and their son’s illness, China Daily reported, citing a court official.

The guides aren’t especially comprehensive or surprising (and, honestly, who traipses around Tokyo with a hardcover in his pocket?), but they’re nonetheless beautifully produced enough for some dreamy armchair travel. What you actually might want in your pocket as you roam a foreign land is a Fabriano notepad. The Bouquet set includes seven booklets, each with a different type of paper — parchment, vellum, embossed — suitable for, say, tracing a gargoyle at Père Lachaise or jotting down first impressions of the Forbidden City. (Remembering a trip through a travel diary can be just as rewarding as browsing old photographs). To keep all your itineraries in order, there’s the new diary set from Moleskine, with a different color soft-cover booklet for each month. It contains plenty of stickers and numbers and ledgers for a total taxonomical orgy, and it all tucks snugly into a black binder that snaps shut with the company’s usual elastic band. The Tumi set is $125 at Tumi stores and tumi.com; Fabriano’s Bouquet is about $17 at Binders; and the Moleskine set is $40 at barnesandnoble.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/gift-guidelet-the-rainbow-connection/

Nothing else is quite so potent a symbol of violated innocence, a spur to pious sentiment or a goad to revenge as a child in peril.

This seems to be an honor accorded successful wartime leaders; in the last C-Span Presidents Day poll, the highest three spots belonged to Lincoln, Washington and Franklin Roosevelt, two war presidents and a general. Yet compared with the reputations of other members of that august pantheon, Wilson’s lags far behind. George W. Bush was described as “Wilsonian” after 9/11, but that was hardly meant as a compliment. Barack Obama, like Wilson a scholar, political neophyte and Nobel Peace Prize winner, prefers to be compared to Lincoln and the second Roosevelt, or even to Truman and Reagan — practically any other member of the top ranks. Today, the only major public figure who seems to be interested in Wilson is the Fox News host Glenn Beck, who traces the roots of our current “socialist” predicament back to the dark era of Wilsonian income taxes, war propaganda and obscure monetary symbols.

2009-12-11,John Singer Sargent’s Model Children,"When I moved to Boston some years ago, I made an early trip to the Museum of Fine Arts and found myself face to face with John Singer Sargent’s nearly life-size portrait of four pinafore-clad girls, “The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit.” Unlike many other visitors, I didn’t take a seat on the bench in front of this haunting picture and study the canvas intently — or, as some have, begin to weep. I didn’t even stay very long and, in the many times I’ve visited the painting since, I’ve never stopped to gaze at length, afraid I might not be able to quit looking. There has always been something mysterious and disturbing about these four girls, conventionally dressed and well-mannered though they seem: the antithesis of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, who entered the public consciousness so boisterously in the late 1860s, just over a decade before Sargent painted the enigmatic Boit sisters.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/books/review/Marshall-t.html

Swanning, anyone?” Ms. Smith, need you even ask? Nearly 150 objects, representing about 75 percent of the Met’s French Art Deco collection, are on view; the most the museum has ever exhibited at one time. Look for a silver coffee and tea service by Jean E. Puiforcat, “whose simple geometric flutings create such complex reflections that you may miss the service’s substantial lapis lazuli and ivory fittings.” As well as glass vases and perfume bottles by Henri Navarre, and examples of the “mincing, gorgeously veneered desks and cabinets dreamed up by the incomparable Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann.” Ms. Smith adds, “their exquisite burl or rosewood legs taper to ivory conclusions as delicate and sexy as the white socks of a well-bred quarter-horse.” Makes all our Ikea pieces seem just a bit shabby.

Mr. Abu Aita, an interview subject who is characterized as a terrorist in the movie, says he has been misrepresented and is suing Mr. Baron Cohen for slander, The Associated Press reported. In the film Mr. Baron Cohen (in the guise of Brüno, above) travels to the Middle East and interviews Mr. Abu Aita, who he says is a leader of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. Mr. Baron Cohen explained how the scene was created during an interview on “Late Show With David Letterman” in July: “We thought, what could people see that they’ve never seen before on film? And we thought one thing would be a comedian interviewing a terrorist.” Mr. Abu Aita has previously said he is not a member of Al Aksa, and is a member of a regional committee of Fatah, the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. In his lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, Mr. Abu Aita said he is a Christian and a “peace-loving person who abhors violence,” according to The A.P. He also said that the “Brüno” interview was not conducted at a secret location, as Mr. Baron Cohen has said, but at a hotel he chose. Mr. Abu Aita also named NBC Universal, which distributed the film, and its director, Larry Charles, in the lawsuit, as well as CBS, which broadcasts “Late Show,” and Mr. Letterman’s production company, Worldwide Pants.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/arts/11arts-STAROFBRNOSU_BRF.html

Recent acquisitions include “Avedon Fashion 1944-2000,” Laura Letinsky’s “Hardly More Than Ever” and Barbara Crane’s “Private Views” — a relative bargain at only $39.95! If you’re a photo bibliophile like me and in San Francisco this weekend, stop by the Fraenkel Gallery’s book sale on Dec. 11 and 12. Sadly, I’m in New York and unable to browse the hundreds of signed, rare and out-of-print books by photo gods like Diane Arbus, Irving Penn and Garry Winogrand.

2009-12-11,Now Tippling | London’s Leading Microbrew," As young men in 1980s London, Alistair Hook and Ben Joseph played in punk bands, chased girls and drank a lot of beer. They started brewing their own in Hook’s small flat in the city’s Greenwich neighborhood and, after developing a taste for artisanal brews, they officially introduced Meantime Brewing and opened their first brewery and pub, the Greenwich Union, in 2001. More than a dozen types of beer later — including pilsners, stouts, wheats, flavored brews and a yearly roster of limited-edition releases — Meantime has become the only real beer success story to come out of London in a very long time.  Hook says he started Meantime not only because he loved beer, but also because of what he considered to be London’s appalling British beer scene. Artisanal beers produced in Britain are predominantly D.I.Y. one-man shows, brewed in houses or garages or small pubs, and mostly in the bread-basket regions of Kent and Sussex. There is no microbrew movement here; indeed, eight out of 10 beers consumed in the city come from foreign companies, like Anheuser-Busch, Heineken and SABMiller. “They taste of nothing,” says Hook, referring to the pasteurization process of mass-produced beer, which wipes out the carefully cultivated flavors that American microbreweries are famous for. Meantime’s efforts aren’t appreciated by everyone. The company is often castigated by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), a British organization dedicated to preserving Britain’s historical brewing standards. By definition, British Real Ale is fermented in the vessel it’s consumed from, whereas Meantime’s beers are brewed and fermented slowly in giant steel tanks. CAMRA maintains that Meantime Brewing is quintessentially un-British. That may be one reason that the United States is Meantime’s largest export market, selling to pubs and shops in 29 states. (You can find a full list on the Web site.) But the company is certainly gaining ground at home. Having since moved their headquarters to the crusty Docklands warehouse district in south London, the men of Meantime will open their second pub and brewing lab in March. The Old Brewery will occupy a site that, 300 years ago, was home to the Royal Naval Hospital’s brewery, an operation set up to provide veterans and war pensioners with their daily pint. Records show that Londoners have been brewing beer on the same site since the time of Henry VIII.  Until then, look out for the release this month of Meantime’s last seasonal lager for the year, a smocked bock brewed in the Franconian style — meaning the Munich malts used in the recipe are smoked. Hook says the beer tastes like Christmas in a bottle, with notes of ham, smoked cheese and other hearty foods found at the table this time of year. You may have to look hard for it, though. Hook is unconcerned with meeting quotas or filling orders ahead of his competition. “We’re not always on schedule with our beer deliveries,” he says, “but then we don’t rush the fermentation process. We want the flavors in our beers to reach full potential. After all, what’s in a name is what it’s all about.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/now-tippling-londons-leading-microbrew/

2009-12-14,Tiger Woods and the Perils of Modern Celebrity,"The time has come, perhaps, to retire — or at least rethink — the adage “there is no such thing as bad publicity.” True, there will always be people who seek attention of any kind, like Richard and Mayumi Heene, the parents of the “balloon boy” who captured headlines in October, or Tareq and Michaele Salahi, who brazened their way into President Obama’s first state dinner, in November. But for those whose prominence is rooted in the older tradition of justly earned renown — the truly gifted, the authentically accomplished — publicity is as likely to diminish as exalt. Exhibit A is, of course, Tiger Woods, whose prowess on the golf course has lately been overshadowed, first by a rash of tabloid reports of infidelities and then by his announcement on Friday that he will “take an indefinite break from professional golf” and “focus my attention on being a better husband, father, and person.”",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/weekinreview/13tanenhaus.html

Cynicism is easy in an era when “family values” is a battle cry and disgraced leaders always profess to be stepping down to spend more time with their families. But there really is some indissoluble thread that creates families; sometimes of total strangers, sometimes for only moments. When we see it, it resonates.

2009-12-14,Wanderlust | Chicago’s Culti Boutique,"Culti, the Milan-based brand of luxury goods founded by Alessandro Agrati, has brought its version of creamy Italian opulence stateside with a new boutique in Chicago.

Since then, he has built a mini-empire, with shops in Milan and St. Moritz, day spas and cafes in Italian cities from Naples to Lake Garda, and a small hotel in Puglia. So the no-nonsense Midwestern capital might not seem the obvious choice for a company selling a particular fantasy of la dolce vita — casual dinner parties on yarn-dyed linen place mats, separate sets of silver for home and yacht, leather-lined closets stocked with cashmere jumpsuits. But Agrati is counting on the fact that the Windy City’s long winters and large apartments make a market ripe for nesting. And anyway, what’s not to like about hand-blown glass candleholders, linen kimonos and cashmere throws, all of it made in Italy? Later this month, Agrati will unveil Culti shops in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, and eventually, he says, he hopes to open in New York and Los Angeles.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/wanderlust-chicagos-culti-boutique/

The final product was a neo-renaissance exhibit presented by James Fuentes gallery  at the official Art Basel convention center (minus the skate ramp of course).Growing up in the hedonistic boys’ club of influential downtown artists — Ryan McGinley, Dan Colen, Dash Snow (to whom she was married for nine years) and Aaron Bondaroff — Snow is an island unto herself. Her roots are literally that: she was born on Corsica, the Mediterranean island surrounded by blue waters but formed by volcanic explosions. She creates a world that is messy, isolated and full of decay, with beauty revealing itself in the least likely places. (Such as at this Christmas dinner party for the Times in 2007.)

The director will be Barry Levinson, who won an Oscar for “Rain Man” and was nominated for “Bugsy.” (More recently, he has been producing television, including the HBO prison series, “Oz.”) Buck Henry, who just turned 79, is writing the screenplay, Ms. Kingsley said. Mr. Henry is best known for writing “The Graduate,” and his other credits range from the original “Get Smart” television series to “To Die For,” starring Nicole Kidman. “The book is perfect for him”  Mr. Pacino  “because he has a love of the stage, and although he has never personally experienced these feelings, he understands them,” Ms. Kingsley said. Although “The Humbling” received mixed critical notices, Mr. Roth, of course, has won pretty much every writing honor available other than the Nobel Prize, including the National Book Award (twice) and a Pulitzer Prize.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/movies/15arts-PACINOBUYSRI_BRF.html

In a telephone interview Mr. Surnow said his personal views would not influence the story. “We’re not making judgments about their political decisions,” he said. “This is a family story.” He added: “When I was a kid, Jack Kennedy seemed like a character of destiny, and he wasn’t. He was a reluctant hero.” The mini-series, planned for broadcast in 2011, will be written by Steve Kronish and directed by Jon Cassar, both veteran producers of “24.” Nancy Dubuc, the president and general manager of History, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Kronish, whom she described as left leaning, would balance Mr. Surnow. She added: “Does it mean that this is going to be a Valentine? No, but a Valentine wouldn’t be appropriate for our channel on any story.

Financial disclosures released by the government revealed that Mr. Rattner was an investor in Cerberus Capital Management, which owned the majority of Chrysler and GMAC.

The inmates argued that state law further reduced the 80-year sentences by half or more for good behavior. The case has infuriated Democrats and Republicans across the tough-on-crime state, but prisoner advocates say the inmates have lawfully earned their freedom.

2009-12-16,Cromer to Return to ‘Our Town’,"David Cromer’s directing gig on “Brighton Beach Memoirs” might have been a bit shorter than anticipated, but he is nonetheless being welcomed back to the Barrow Street Theater’s production of “Our Town” with open arms. Mr. Cromer, who directed this “Our Town” (as well as its Chicago incarnation) will return to the role of the Stage Manager for a limited run, the show’s publicists said on Tuesday. Having passed the part to Jason Butler Harner in August, Mr. Cromer will reclaim it Dec. 22 through Jan. 3. Starting Jan. 5, the role will go to Stephen Kunken, whose Broadway credits include “Rock ’n’ Roll” and “Frost/Nixon.” On Wednesday, the production of “Our Town” at Barrow Street Theater will hold its 337th performance, making it the longest-running version of the play in its 71-year history, according to the Thornton Wilder estate. ...The Vineyard Theater has announced a cast of 13, including John Cullum, Brandon Victor Dixon and Colman Domingo, for the world premiere of “The Scottsboro Boys,” the new musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb. The musical, to be directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman, was one of the team’s last collaborations before Mr. Ebb’s death in 2004. The book is by David Thompson. “The Scottsboro Boys” is based on the 1930s legal case against a group of black teenagers accused of attacking two white women.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/theater/16arts-CROMERTORETU_BRF.html

Also being honored this year, as nonperformers, are David Geffen and seven songwriters: Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, Jesse Stone, Mort Shuman and Otis Blackwell.

2009-12-16,Foote’s ‘Orphans’ Could See Broadway,"Signature Theater Company and the producers Jeffrey Richards and Daryl Roth are discussing a possible transfer of the Signature production of Horton Foote’s last play, “The Orphans’ Home Cycle,” to Broadway in April after its Off Broadway run, said three people involved in the production. Mr. Richards, one of Broadway’s busiest producers, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday afternoon that he was “certainly” interested in the possible transfer of “Orphans,” a three-part, nine-hour play based on the lives of Foote’s parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s. “I think it’s a great piece of theater,” he said. Of a possible transfer, he added, “Other people are looking at it too.” The three people involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the transfer discussion was meant to be private, said the talks involving Mr. Richards and Ms. Roth  who produced “Irena’s Vow” on Broadway last season and many other plays  accelerated after the exuberant reviews for Part 1 of the cycle last month. The talks have reached a serious stage, but no commitments had been made, these people said. The idea is to transfer and open the production in time to be eligible for the Tony Awards this June.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/theater/16arts-FOOTESORPHAN_BRF.html
2009-12-16,Writers Guild Disputes Random House on E-Rights,"The Authors Guild, a trade group that represents writers, posted a statement on its Web site (authorsguild.org) on Tuesday disputing efforts by Random House to claim e-book rights to titles published before 1994. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that “the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats.” But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. “Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random House’s standard contracts prior to 1994,” the guild wrote. The statement continued: “Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.”  Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company “respectfully disagrees” with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were “ours to maximize.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/books/16arts-WRITERSGUILD_BRF.html

A unanimous vote, in which more than 200 members of the local 32 BJ of the Service Employees International Union participated, gave the union bargaining committee the authority to settle or strike. The workers are involved in negotiations with the Broadway League, which represents theater owners, and are demanding a pay raise of $1.50 an hour, a promise not to see their health insurance cut and additional pension benefits. The union’s contract expires on Dec. 31, though a spokesman said the last scheduled bargaining date with the Broadway League was this Thursday. The actor Jimmy Smits, who is currently starring in “God of Carnage” at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, addressed the workers who were voting in a midtown hotel and urged them to “fight for what’s fair and just.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/broadway-service-workers-give-union-authority-to-strike-or-settle/

My own take is that religion has often been part of the problem, but that it also can be part of the solution. I’ve seen people kill in the name of religion, and I’ve seen people reject condoms in the name of religion even as a tool for fighting AIDS (which usually means people dying). But I’ve also seen Catholic nuns showing unbelievable courage and compassion in corners of the world where no other aid workers are around, and mission clinics and church-financed schools too numerous to mention. And in Islamic countries, I’ve seen mullahs who are hypocritical misogynists but also some imams who are leading a push for education and justice. In short, I don’t think there’s any glib answer to the question, but there is no question that religions can be a force for justice and equality that they are now not.

Other studies, cited by Michael Cannon and John Goodman, suggest that the number is considerably closer to zero — or else that the link between health insurance and mortality might be too murky too penetrate.

When confronted by the possibility of donating her brain-injured daughter’s organs after the accident, Beaulieu never doubted that Amanda would have wanted them to go to someone who needed them.

In the feminine version of the genre, the heroines typically possess awesome powers of desirability. In Harrison’s spin, the male leads aren’t much to look at (usually), yet they possess awesome powers of desire. Whether a whippersnapper of 12 or a “geezer rancher” in his 70s, the Harrison hero unfailingly sparks the ardor of any girl or woman he encounters, even when he’s sick, drunk and drugged, having his teeth pulled, passing kidney stones or dying. He doesn’t mind if a woman is a few decades older than he is or half a century younger; whether she’s a king-size Lakota divorcée pushing 60 or a “miniature” young nurse with a boyfriend. Nor does he care if she’s cruel or kind, married or single, straight or gay. Whoever she is, if she’ll have him, he’s up for the job.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/review/Schillinger-t.html
2009-12-17,"After the War, Before the War","“It is a fact so familiar that we seldom remember how very strange it is,” the historian George N. Clark wrote in 1932, “that the commonest phrases we hear used about civilization at the present time all relate to the possibility, or even the prospect, of its being destroyed.” In “The Twilight Years,” his thought-­provoking and illuminating new study of the interwar period, Richard Overy contends that before 1914 the British believed they had conquered the world and would rule it forever. After World War I, a wrecked generation had to pick up the pieces of that world and ask what went wrong. It is this process that occupies the book, which successfully adopts a broad-brush approach to cultural life without obscuring gemlike details. During the 1920s and ’30s, Britain saw itself as a civilization in crisis, facing the ominous dawn of a new Dark Age.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/review/VonTunzelmann-t.html

2009-12-17,Not Quite Home Alone," The apartment that I moved into on Dec. 17 last year was not romantic — but “romantic” and “Manhattan real estate” are rarely terms that coincide for a newly single middle-aged woman. The apartment did not hold the cachet of top-of-the-stairs living. You needed only to ascend a few steps to the scarred brown door labeled “2B.” The latch was faulty, and because the sublet was illegal and I was too broke to call a locksmith, I lived with the door that would not lock. The odds were low that out of all the apartments in all of the old tenements in the city, someone would try doorknobs then risk prison time to steal a clutch of clothing and books from mine. It went something along the lines of Of all the gin joints in the world. . . . But who had time for that kind of romance?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/magazine/20lives-t.html

Though bound by their husbands’ authority, 18th-century women were expected to be the domestic managers of their family’s affairs.

So the rumor mill sputtered up immediately, with reports that the Globe nomination group, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, was swayed by a party that Mr. Maguire’s longtime friend Leonardo DiCaprio threw for him recently. Attendees, which the reports initially said included 40 of the 90-member association, received gift bags containing pricey Blu-ray players. Given that the association has long battled an image of being freebie-loving, star wattage-driven pushovers, this was not a good look. Bloggers immediately perked up.But within hours, Nikki Finke, who had first reported the dust-up, corrected the story: only 15 members from the association were present, it turned out, and they were asked to return their Blu-ray players.

So Ms. Weil, an e-commerce veteran (she was previously a director in the Internet group at Ameritrade), started The Wallpaper Collective, a Web site that sells wallcoverings directly to the consumer. “It’s frustrating  and expensive  to buy wallpaper through the trade,” she said. “I wanted to take the hassle out of it.” The site carries the work of 15 designers, over 100 patterns in all, some of them contemporary versions of traditional toile and trellis designs. (Rose Orange, top left, and Poppy Red, below it, by Camilla Meijer, are $420 for a 49-square-foot roll.) Ms. Weil offers what she calls “artisanal wallpaper,” which originated as hand-painted or blocked patterns by tiny studios and is produced in small print runs.

The sets focus on Thompson’s compositions, mostly from the second half of his career and on Tuesday the music’s “writing contained unusual turns: a chord change on every other beat in the étudelike ‘Monsoon’; a waltz with unusual harmonic wending in ‘Soul-Lullaby’; a masked blues form in the theme of ‘Prey-Loot.’ It’s rich ground.” Mr. Reed’s quartet, with the saxophonist Victor Goines, the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Rodney Green, celebrates Thompson through Sunday at Dizzy’s.",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/urbaneye/17ubn3.html

The 47-year-old artist, the child of a leftist mural painter and teacher, studied in Mexico City and is the subject of a career retrospective at MoMA that runs through March 1. Part of Mr. Orozco’s initial appeal was his approach to art. “Dodging commitments to mediums or styles, he took improvisation as his baseline method, and turned personal quirks into assets,” writes Holland Cotter. Although the “shock and delight of puzzlement, of seeing nothing turn into something before your eyes,” from the first show are gone, there are still treasures to be found in this exhibition, including dozens of small sculptures set out on shelves and tables in the last gallery. “Some are sketchy or merely busy, but others do what Mr. Orozco has always done best: find the cosmic in the commonplace, sweeten abjection with wisdom and wit.”",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/urbaneye/17ubn1.html

Thomas Philion, who was hired in April 2007 after brief tenures by two other administrators, is credited with balancing the company’s $22 million budget and pushing to expand its programming. But it still has $4 million in debt, and its endowment is $24 million — low for an orchestra of its size. Last year, Gerard Schwarz, the symphony’s longtime music director and a frequent focus of musicians’ grievances — two lawsuits have been filed against him in recent years complaining of harsh treatment, both dismissed — announced he would be leaving when his contract expires in 2011. Mr. Philion has offered little public explanation for his own departure. In an interview with The Seattle Times, he said, “When an organization goes through a transition like this, someone in my position pauses and reflects and thinks about what makes sense, and I’ve decided it’s time for me.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/seattle-symphony-president-to-step-down/

Although we may profess to believe, as the linguist Dwight Bolinger once put it, that dictionaries “do not exist to define but to help people grasp meanings,” we don’t often act on that belief.

Spotting them from yards away, one was hard pressed to distinguish a private from an officer. The slipshod dress — soldiers had no uniforms at the Battle of Bunker Hill — often created confusion in the ranks. Soon enough Gen. Washington insisted on uniforms for all his men. The standards of military dress would be elevated even more in succeeding American engagements. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/books/excerpt-sweet-thunder.html

Those looking for added impetus to watch the New Mexico Bowl — as if you needed it — can look toward a matchup of second-level teams from the Western Athletic and Mountain West conferences as a potential litmus test for January’s Fiesta Bowl, which pits the respective champions (Boise State and Texas Christian) of each conference. However, unlike the Fiesta, this bowl has a decided favorite. Before handing the cherished New Mexico Bowl title to Fresno State, however, take note: the Bulldogs entered this same bowl game last season as sizable favorites, but fell to a hungry Colorado State team (also from the Mountain West, like Wyoming) that preached the same ball-control, turnover-free offense the Cowboys have used to reach six wins.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/new-mexico-bowl-fresno-state-8-4-vs-wyoming-6-6/

(Beef O’Brady’s is not, in fact, a person, but a chain of sports bars located throughout the South and Midwest.) My interest in the St. Petersburg Bowl does not extend too far past this point, though one must respect the job Central Florida has done in overcoming preseason doubts to finish 8-4, with the highlight of the season an upset win over then-No. 15 Houston.

According to the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo the diary of the archaeologist who discovered the 3,500-year-old bust shows that he misled authorities when it was transferred abroad. In an e-mail statement the council said the diary of Ludwig Borchardt, who found the bust in 1912, showed he knew the head was of Queen Nefertiti but instead reported it as a “painted plaster bust of a princess.” The statement said, “These materials confirm Egypt’s contention that Borchardt did act unethically with the intent to deceive.” The diary was presented to Egypt by Friederike Seyfried, director of the Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung in Berlin, where the bust is on display at the Neues Museum. Egypt will formally ask for the return of the bust this week. Bernd Neumann, the German culture minister, has said that his country obtained the bust lawfully, and that Egypt had no grounds to seek its return.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/arts/design/21arts-SEEKINGBUSTS_BRF.html

2009-12-21,Did The Republicans Blunder On Health Care?,"Yes, say Jonathan Chait and David Frum, in pre-mortems for the G.O.P.’s efforts to derail the Democratic bill. Chait argues that the Republicans could have sold moderate Democrats on a “vastly more limited” piece of legislation, if they’d been willing to compromise early in the process. Instead, by uniting in lockstep opposition and gambling that the difficulties of getting to sixty would doom the Democratic effort, the G.O.P. has ensured that “they’ll walk away with nothing.” Frum, meanwhile, suggests that Republicans placed too much rhetorical emphasis on “the freedom of healthcare providers to do business in their own way, free of government interference,” and not enough emphasis on holding the line on costs. By fearmongering about death panels and attacking Medicare cuts, he argues, the G.O.P. riled up its ideological base but failed to rally “the institutional supporters of the Republican party, the taxpayers, small business owners and corporate leaders” who care about cost control.

Mr. Tovey said he was asked to conduct the orchestra during recording sessions but that another conductor would mime his performance during the actual ceremony, adding, “I regarded that as fraudulent and withdrew.” In a joint statement reported by The Sun, Vanoc and the orchestra said “the complex technical requirements of the Opening Ceremonies have put the V.S.O. in a difficult position.” According to the statement, the orchestra will not contribute directly to the Feb. 12 opening ceremony event but will perform in the Cultural Olympiad that takes place during the Games.

The most attention-getting part of that transformation is the Missoni, a 136–room hotel opened this year by the Italian fashion house in the very center of town. The creative director, Rosita Missoni, designed the property, mixing a stark black-and-white palette with bright bursts of color, like purple glass walls, blood-orange hallways and symmetrically striped carpeting. The brand’s classic colorful textiles play especially well here; somehow, even the doormen’s Chevron zig-zag kilts seem not a thread overworked in a city of somber gray stone and black medieval spires. My standard room, which came with free Wi-Fi and an espresso machine, was dressed in an ensemble of lacquered ruby, robin’s egg blue, lemongrass and moss green.

The two-hour finale (in which Natalie White, below, won the show’s $1 million prize over the heavily favored Russell Hantz) delivered an average of 14.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s estimates. Ratings for the latest “Survivor” finale, the 19th in the series, were up from 13.8 million viewers for the December conclusion a year ago. Combined with a “Survivor” reunion special (12.2 million) that followed, CBS outwitted, outplayed and outranked most of its competitors  except for NBC and its “Sunday Night Football” coverage. Although final ratings for the Carolina-Minnesota game were not available on Monday, preliminary estimates were higher than all other programming for the night, but slightly lower than last week’s game, which drew 20.9 million viewers. Fox was third, with repeats of its animated comedies, and ABC finished fourth with “The Santa Clause 3.” BENJAMIN TOFF",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/arts/television/22arts-006.html

On Monday CBS said “Undercover Boss” would have its premiere on Feb. 7 after the Super Bowl. CBS identified some of the participating executives as Joseph DePinto, president of 7-Eleven; Dave Rife, above, an owner of White Castle; and Coby G. Brooks, president of Hooters. They work clandestinely alongside their rank-and-file employees, looking for insights into their businesses while they get their hands dirty flipping burgers and emptying grease traps. If it wasn’t hard convincing American executives to be part of the show, Mr. Lambert said it didn’t take much more effort for these bosses to go incognito among their employees. “We tell everybody that we’re filming with that we’re making a program about somebody trying out entry-level jobs in their business,” Mr. Lambert said in a telephone interview. “We just don’t happen to mention that they’re also the boss.

Though Mr. McElderry, a winner of the British reality series “The X Factor,” was the odds-on favorite, he was undone by Jon Morter, a 35-year-old logistics expert and music fan who started a Facebook group encouraging support for the Rage Against the Machine single. With the attention of the news media and help from hundreds of thousands of Internet supporters, the song sold more than 500,000 copies in its most recent week of release, while “The Climb” sold 450,000. In a statement, Rage Against the Machine, which includes Zack de la Rocha, above, said, “We extend our heartfelt thanks to every fan and freedom fighter who helped make our anthem of defiance and rebellion the Anarchy Christmas Miracle of 2009.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/arts/music/22arts-004.html

At a news conference on Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is scheduled to put his signature in wet concrete, along with other city officials and some writers whom the Signature has spotlighted, like Edward Albee and Bill Irwin. The city has increased its contribution to the project to $25 million from $9.5 million. “It’s becoming real,” said James Houghton, the Signature’s artistic director, adding that he expected the company to move in 2012.

In a segment that appeared on the Dec. 5 episode of the show, Seth Meyers, anchor of the mock news segment “Weekend Update” and its head writer, noted reports that Ms. Murphy had recently been fired from a film project called “The Caller.” He was soon joined at the “Weekend Update” desk by his cast mate Abby Elliott, who was impersonating Ms. Murphy. The fictional Ms. Murphy seemed to be disoriented and still under the impression that she was on an episode that Ms. Murphy hosted in 2002. Though video of the sketch was posted on hulu.com soon after the show was broadcast, it disappeared from the site after Ms. Murphy died on Sunday.

2009-12-22,‘Avatar’ Opening Grosses: The Sequels," It seems that 20th Century Fox got a bit carried away as it counted final “Avatar” grosses. On Sunday Fox said that this 3-D science-fiction epic directed by James Cameron had made $73 million in its debut weekend. But that figure was based on studio estimates of Sunday ticket sales. Early on Monday, after Sunday sales figures were available, Chris Aronson, Fox’s senior vice president for domestic distribution, said “Avatar” had actually raked in $77.3 million in North America over the weekend. That meant that it had beaten Will Smith’s “I Am Legend,” which opened in 2007 at $77.2 million and holds the record for a December opening. Then, a couple of hours later, Fox was forced to try to pick up the confetti, saying the final total for “Avatar” was actually $76.8 million, below the record for “Legend.” And soon thereafter came yet another correction: the final number  Fox promised  was actually $77,025,481.

2009-12-22,Now Showing | David Benjamin Sherry,"With his latest solo show, “Birth in Futurverse,” at the Schlechtriem Brothers Gallery in Berlin, the photographer David Benjamin Sherry has moved into a more personal realm. Many of the photos on display feature Sherry, a graduate of Yale’s M.F.A. program known for his recent forays into fashion photography, in surreal tableaus that collapse the boundaries between nature and the human body. For example, “Self Portrait as The Born Feeling Begins”, features Sherry immersed in a green, viscous swamp, his body painted an identical electric shade. “Throwing Darts in Lovers Eyes II” presents what appears to be an indigo-hued desertscape, with an upside-down pyramid, its Masonic symbolism suspended in the sky. Sherry’s use of hyper-saturated color (created without any digital enhancement) is both a means and an end — intense color fields capture the viewer’s eye, drawing him in, while allowing him to be affected by deep emotion.“Birth in Futurverse” runs through Feb. 20.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/now-showing-david-benjamin-sherry/

On Tuesday, publicists for the revival said that Mr. Oswalt (who has recently gotten good notices for his performance in the film “Big Fan”) would star alongside Megan Mullally (of “Will & Grace” and Broadway’s “Young Frankenstein”) in the play about two couples who spend a revealing Fourth of July weekend on Fire Island. Mr. Oswalt will play Sam Truman, a role portrayed by Nathan Lane in the play’s 1991 production for Manhattan Theater Club, and Ms. Mullally will play Chloe Haddock, who was then played by Christine Baranski. The Roundabout production will be directed by Joe Mantello, who directed Mr. McNally’s comedy “The Ritz.” Previews are scheduled to begin April 9 at the American Airlines Theater, with an official opening slated for April 29.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/no-joke-patton-oswalt-plans-broadway-debut/

More specifically, they started rising around Thanksgiving, climbed inexorably through Christmas and peaked on New Year’s Day. A subsequent study of death certificates nationwide, published in Circulation in 2004, confirmed the association between the two holidays and heart-attack deaths.

Not so long as people can take a seat on a scarlet banquette at his restaurant, sit beneath a towering spray of flowers, and eat sumptuous food out of Escoffier.” When you go, look for “Thackeray characters come to life in a modern age” and revel in the “classic French” cuisine. Begin, as Mr. Sifton suggests, with sweetbreads, “accompanied by a small bit of demi-glace made piney with rosemary, they provide an instant view of a world in which plenty is not nearly so important as quality”; continue with a simple endive salad, beef oxtails of “uncommon excellence,” the Dover sole and a soufflé for dessert.

Through Tuesday night, ticket revenues in North America for the year stood at slightly more than $10 billion, according to multiplex analysts at Hollywood.com. The movie business has never crossed that threshold before in actual dollars, and there is no doubt that the movies had a great year. Hollywood.com estimates that sales will be up 9 percent over last year, with a 5 percent rise in attendance. Even so, the dollar amount is not a record. When adjusted for inflation, 2002 had sales of $11.21 billion, while the totals for 2001, 2003 and 2004 also exceed this year’s tally.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/movies/24arts-HOLLYWOODPAS_BRF.html

2009-12-24,Susan Boyle Defeated? Keep Dreaming,"Holiday shopping increased record sales across the board last week, but Susan Boyle remains queen of the season. Her “I Dreamed a Dream” (Syco Music/Columbia) sold 661,000 copies for a four-week total of 2.46 million, according to Nielsen SoundScan. There are two sales weeks left in 2009, and it’s going to be a close race for the best-selling album of the year: “I Dreamed a Dream” is gaining fast on Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” (Big Machine), which has sold 2.93 million this year. (“Fearless,” No. 4 this week, has moved more than five million copies since it was released in November 2008.) Alicia Keys’s new album, “The Element of Freedom” (J), opened at No. 2 with 417,000 sales, and the only other major new release was Robin Thicke’s “Sex Therapy: The Experience” (Interscope), at No. 9, with 123,000. Otherwise, this week’s top 10 is a slightly reshuffled version of last week’s: Andrea Bocelli slipped one spot to No. 3; Carrie Underwood held at No. 5, and Lady Gaga at No. 6; Michael Bublé climbed two to No. 7; Justin Bieber stood at No. 8; while “Glee: The Music, Volume 2” (Columbia) fell seven spots to No. 10.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/arts/music/24arts-SUSANBOYLEDE_BRF.html

The production of “Speed-the-Plow,” which had been set for the Mark Taper Forum in February, had not yet been cast, Mr. Pepe said, when the opportunity came about to do “Roses” with Mr. Sheen. “The Subject Was Roses,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1964 play by Frank D. Gilroy, provided a big break to Mr. Sheen early in his career, when, at 23, he appeared on Broadway as a soldier returning to his parents after serving in World War II. Mr. Sheen was nominated for a Tony Award for best featured actor and also played the role in the 1968 film version. In the revival, which Mr. Pepe will direct, Mr. Sheen will play the father, joined by Frances Conroy (“Six Feet Under,” and a Tony nominee in 2000 for “The Ride Down Mt. Morgan”) as the mother and Brian Geraghty (“The Hurt Locker”) as the son.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/arts/24arts-THESUBJECTWA_BRF.html

In March, T.I., whose given name is Clifford Harris, was sentenced to one year and one day in prison after he pleaded guilty to illegal weapons possession. The charges stemmed from his arrest in 2007 after a sting operation in which he was caught receiving three machine guns and two silencers that had been bought for him. Following a guilty plea, T.I. performed more than 1,000 hours of community service and appeared on an MTV reality series, “T.I.’s Road to Redemption,” in which he warned teenagers about the dangers of guns and violence. His lawyer, Steve Sadow, told The A.P. that the rapper was expected to report to Dismas Charities halfway house in Atlanta on Tuesday night and would be there for up to three months.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/arts/music/24arts-LAWYERSAYSTI_BRF.html
2009-12-24,"At ‘American Idol,’ Old Rules for New Year","While the Academy Awards hope to attract a larger viewership by allowing more competitors for its top prize, “American Idol” is betting the opposite way. In advance of its ninth season, Fox said “American Idol,” its popular singing competition, would return to its traditional format in which 24 semifinalists  12 women and 12 men  are chosen in the Hollywood rounds to vie for the title. Last year “Idol” altered its rules to allow 36 contestants. Fox gave no reason for the return to the original format, though a smaller pool of semifinalists, and thus fewer rounds of competition, might give viewers less time to get tired of the contestants: the “Idol” finale in May was down more than three million viewers from its 2008 conclusion, the second-lowest-rated finale in the show’s history. There is already plenty of change afoot on “Idol,” which will return on Jan. 12 without its longtime judge Paula Abdul. She’ll be replaced by rotating guest judges during regional auditions, including Victoria Beckham, Mary J. Blige, Kristin Chenoweth and Neil Patrick Harris; Ellen DeGeneres will join the judging panel when the show arrives in Hollywood in February.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/arts/television/24arts-ATAMERICANID_BRF.html

In November the Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry said that Mr. Tyler had quit the band, then reunited with him days later at a concert in New York. In his statement to Rolling Stone, Mr. Tyler denied planning to take a hiatus from the group. “I will enthusiastically be writing, recording and performing with Aerosmith as soon as things are handled,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/arts/music/24arts-STEVENTYLERO_BRF.html

The Williams archive is so vast that much of it is still uncataloged, and there are also works that are hiding in plain sight. “The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,” a script he wrote in 1957, when he was at the peak of his fame and powers, was collected in an anthology of his screenplays in the mid-’80s but remained unproduced until recently, when Jodie Markell, who had never directed a feature before, exhumed it.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/movies/27diamond.html

The shorter period is intended to focus attention on how best to reorganize the force to protect civilians in the eastern Congo, and to respond to President Joseph Kabila’s request that the United Nations start developing an exit strategy for the peacekeeping force, the world’s largest, which has been active since November 1999. The new resolution emphasized that peacekeepers should support Congolese Army operations only when there is a plan in place to protect civilians, and that the United Nations soldiers should intercede if Congolese troops abuse civilians. The Congolese Army went on the offensive this year against some rebel groups, and the United Nations provided logistical support.

2009-12-24,Russia: Arrest of Tycoon’s Partner Ruled Illegal," Russia’s Supreme Court has ruled that the arrest in 2003 of a business partner of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned former oligarch, was illegal, affirming a decision by a European court, officials said Wednesday. But the Russian ruling did not appear to have any immediate practical effect on the case against Mr. Khodorkovsky or his partner, Platon Lebedev. Both have been serving eight-year prison terms after being convicted in a tax-fraud case and are now on trial on new charges. Their supporters say they became targets of prosecutors because Mr. Khodorkovsky, at the time Russia’s richest man, ventured into politics and challenged Vladimir V. Putin, then the president and now the prime minister. Mr. Lebedev had appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2007 that his rights had been violated when he was arrested. But the Russian court did not adopt the European ruling until now, and it did not order any change in Mr. Lebedev’s status. Defense lawyers said that beyond the symbolism of the decision, they did not expect any significant impact on the case in the near future.

2009-12-24,There’s Only One Way to Stop Iran,"PRESIDENT OBAMA should not lament but sigh in relief that Iran has rejected his nuclear deal, which was ill conceived from the start. Under the deal, which was formally offered through the United Nations, Iran was to surrender some 2,600 pounds of lightly enriched uranium (some three-quarters of its known stockpile) to Russia, and the next year get back a supply of uranium fuel sufficient to run its Tehran research reactor for three decades. The proposal did not require Iran to halt its enrichment program, despite several United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding such a moratorium.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/opinion/24kuperman.html

His presence has been sorely missed there. The Warriors, who are not eligible for bowl play, have won only 13 games over the past two seasons. His magic touch has yielded yet another marvelous turnaround at S.M.U., which finds itself bowling for the first time since the program underwent N.C.A.A.-mandated probation in 1987. Lost amid this mix is Nevada, fresh off a second-place finish in the WAC (behind, of course, Boise State). Nevada should have its way with S.M.U., especially on the ground, as the nation’s top ground game faces off against the nation’s 88th-ranked rush defense. Having said that, count out a June Jones-coached team at your peril; anyone who can win seven games at S.M.U. deserves your respect.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/hawaii-bowl-southern-methodist-7-5-vs-nevada-8-4/

On Saturday, Ms. Winehouse was attending a holiday performance of “Cinderella” at a theater in Milton Keynes, north of London, and was reportedly shouting out comments during the production — not an unheard-of practice in the tradition of British pantomime. But when the theater’s front-of-house manager, Richard Pound, asked Ms. Winehouse to move to a different seat, he said, she pulled his hair and punched him and kicked him. The police told the newspaper that Ms. Winehouse was arrested on Wednesday after making a voluntary appearance at the Milton Keynes police station with her legal adviser.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/winehouse-arrested-after-incident-at-holiday-show/

What’s that? You don’t really know what Led Zeppelin is or was? And you’ve never read that salacious earlier biography, Stephen Davis’s “Hammer of the Gods”? Well, do I have a story for you. Or at least this Mick Wall does, this fellow from England who has also written or co-written definitive biographies of Ozzy, Bono and Iron Maiden. The back story is like this: A hot session guitarist named Jimmy Page kills some time in a band called the Yardbirds (“Shapes of Things,” etc.) until he decides he can do better by assembling the New Yardbirds — except that he is unable to lure away the Who’s rhythm section, which he devoutly wishes to steal, or Steve Marriott of Small Faces, a singer of note. He settles instead for a couple of country yokels, Robert Plant and John Bonham, vocals and drums respectively, and another somewhat frustrated session dude, John Paul Jones, who plays the bass. Of these, Page is most happy about Bonham, who hits the drums as if he is trying to affect seismic activity in the British Isles. About the singer, who is very good looking, he’s not sure. Page doesn’t pay much attention to the bass player at all. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/books/review/Moody-t.html

The first two volumes, unadornedly titled “Boyhood” and “Youth” (and, in contrast to this one, labeled nonfiction), were marked by Coetzee’s decision to write about himself in the third person. In “Summertime” he takes this schism one bracing step farther, by imagining himself already dead. The book is nominally a kind of rough-draft effort by Coetzee’s own biographer, an Englishman named Vincent, to build the case — through transcribed interviews with lovers and colleagues and other figures mentioned by Coetzee in his “posthumously” opened notebooks — for the years 1971-77 as an especially formative period in the late author’s life, “a period,” as Vincent would have it, “when he was still finding his feet as a writer.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/books/review/Dee-t.html

Washington has the cool President Obama, New York the technocratic Mayor Bloomberg and media barons like Rupert Murdoch. Who personifies Miami? Tony Montana? Crockett and Tubbs?

Once a stronghold for Germans, Italians and Poles, this tightknit neighborhood was transformed by immigrants from Portugal beginning in the 1950s; more recently, Brazilians, who share a language with Portugal, have flocked there. The result is a vibrant ethnic slice of Newark, a community that resonates with “obrigado,” Portuguese for “thank you.” The tip of the Ironbound, Ferry Street, is only steps from Newark’s Pennsylvania Station, itself a train ride of less than 20 minutes from Penn Station in Manhattan.

So has this reliable series lost its addictive appeal? Not at all — though it’s a shock to realize that the stories, set in a California coastal town in the 1980s, now read more like historical narratives than contemporary novels with a slight time lag. But it’s an object lesson in disciplined storytelling to watch Grafton manipulate that time frame to broaden the story and deepen the mystery.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/books/review/Crime-t.html

What’s constant is that churches remain a special category of real estate, set-aside zones dedicated to the proposition that all of us, praying-types or not, need quiet places to be alone in public, places to think, feel and see things we may not think, feel and see elsewhere.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/sanctuaries-in-the-city/

The Guardian reported that songs recorded by Ms. Murphy, who had performed in the rock band Blessed Soul and on the soundtrack of the 2006 movie “Happy Feet,” could be released posthumously.

In short order, it was protested by Unico National, the Order of the Sons of Italy in America and the National Italian American Foundation for its frequent use of the term guido and its portrayal of Italian-Americans. It has also drawn complaints from the Jersey Shore Convention & Visitors Bureau. MTV did not immediately respond to the legislators’ caucus, but it has said that the show “depicts just one aspect of youth culture” and is not intended “to stereotype, discriminate or offend.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/arts/television/25arts-NEWJERSEYLAW_BRF.html

And the “winner” is “Wonderful Christmastime,” by Paul McCartney.

In an article published on Tuesday in L’Osservatore Romano under the headline “Aristotle’s Virtues and Homer’s Doughnut,” “The Simpsons” was praised for its “realistic and intelligent writing” (and rapped on the knuckles for “excessively crude language, the violence of certain episodes or some extreme choices by the scriptwriters”). Noting plots in which Homer Simpson has variously renounced his faith and mispronounced the name of Jesus, L’Osservatore Romano wrote that Homer nonetheless “finds in God his last refuge” and that the character’s attitudes toward religion were “a mirror of the indifference and the need that modern man feels toward faith.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/arts/television/25arts-VATICANGIVES_BRF.html

2009-12-25,Lots of Sparkle for a Swift Fall,"THE tradition of dropping a ball in Times Square began more than a century ago when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, hired the sign maker Artkraft Strauss to build  then lower  a 700-pound wood-and-iron ball, five feet in diameter and illuminated by 100 25-watt bulbs, to mark the passage from 1907 to 1908. The ball descended slowly from a flagpole atop One Times Square, at the intersection of Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street, where thousands witness it live  and millions more on television  each New Year’s Eve. The ritual echoes one that has taken place since 1833 at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, where a ball is lowered daily at 1 p.m., originally to help ship captains nearby synchronize their chronometers. Beginning in 1845, there was also a ball dropped each noon at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington so inhabitants could reset their timepieces; it was eventually replaced by more advanced methods including today’s master clock system, which automatically resets using an atomic clock.

The result is a vibrant ethnic slice of Newark, a community that resonates with “obrigado,” Portuguese for “thank you.” The tip of the Ironbound, Ferry Street, is only steps from Newark’s Pennsylvania Station, itself a train ride of less than 20 minutes from Penn Station in Manhattan.

That dubious distinction belonged to the J. J. Abrams-directed reboot of “Star Trek,” featuring Zachary Quinto as a young Spock, which topped a list of disparate films compiled by the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks the file-sharing program BitTorrent. According to that list, “Star Trek” was downloaded close to 11 million times, and other guy-oriented blockbusters dominated the chart: “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” was No. 2, with 10.6 million downloads; “The Hangover” was No. 4, with 9.2 million downloads; “Wolverine” was No. 9, with 7.2 million downloads. But there was no accounting for pirates’ tastes, and no clear correlation between piracy and the overall box office revenues of these movies. The year’s No. 3 was the Guy Ritchie misfire “RocknRolla,” which earned less than $26 million worldwide since its 2008 release but was downloaded more than 9.4 million times; the No. 5 slot went to the first installment of “Twilight,” which took in nearly $385 million globally and was downloaded more than 8.7 million times.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/movies/26arts-MOSTPIRATEDM_BRF.html

Despite the travails, B.C. has extended its streak of eight-win seasons to nine, with the potential for a sixth straight nine-win campaign with a victory Saturday. What about those Trojans?

2009-12-28,Now Shopping | Ancient Industries,"Now that the last Christmas cookies have been eaten and the children’s new plastic toys are broken, shopping is probably the last thing on anyone’s mind, but we’d like to suggest a consumer palate cleanser: Ancient Industries. Started as a biannual trunk show by Megan Wilson, an art director, Ancient Industries is a succinctly curated collection of everyday objects that we take for granted — like dustpans, nail brushes, and colanders — and which, more often than not, are plastic, disposable, ugly and made in China. We tend to hide these things from view; Ancient Industries aims to change that.The American-born Wilson grew up in Europe in the 1970s. With her aesthetics-and-quality-obsessed mother in charge, the family bought only traditionally made, well-designed and modest clothing and home items. When Wilson moved back to the United States, her penchant for quality and tradition led her to continue the pilgrimages of her youth to the markets of Europe, where items made by the “ancient industries,” like Austrian enamelware makers and Menorcan cobblers, still existed. When requests for her continental finds outnumbered the bags she wanted to carry home, she started selling these wares to her friends, then friends of friends, through trunk shows. In August, three years after establishing her business, Wilson set up an e-commerce Web site, and now we can all buy the perfect hot water bottle or enameled milk pot.

Richt took a good first step towards returning his team to double-digit wins by dismissing the defensive coordinator Willie Martinez and opting not to bring back two defensive assistants.

In an article in the January issue of The Art Newspaper, Mr. Bailey wrote that he had devised the theory after studying van Gogh’s painting “Still Life: Drawing Board With Onions,” which the artist completed a month after cutting off part of his left earlobe. Among the details in the painting is an envelope, an image that Mr. Bailey examined under a microscope and said contained a letter in which Theo revealed he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend. “Vincent was fearful that he might lose his brother’s emotional and financial support,” leading to his self-mutilation, Mr. Bailey wrote. Historically, van Gogh’s ear cutting has been attributed to everything from his mental illness to his lead paints to a fight with his fellow painter Paul Gauguin.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/arts/design/29arts-VANGOGHSEAR_BRF.html

In an interview with People.com, the Web site of People magazine, Ms. Banks, right, said she was ending her talk show. “This will be the last season of ‘The Tyra Show,’ ” Ms. Banks told People. “I’ve been loving having fun, coming into your living rooms, bedrooms, hair salons for the past five years.” After its debut in 2005 “The Tyra Banks Show” quickly built a following on the strength of Ms. Banks’s celebrity as a supermodel and reality TV star, her prolific use of the word fierce and her willingness to take on potentially divisive subjects. In November of that year she made headlines for a segment in which she donned a fat suit to look as if she weighed 350 pounds to demonstrate how she was treated differently by strangers. The show won Daytime Emmy Awards in the outstanding talk show (informative) category in 2008 and 2009. The current season of “The Tyra Banks Show,” which is produced by Ms. Banks’s company Bankable Productions and Telepictures and is distributed by Warner Brothers, will finish production in the spring. She said she would then focus on a new film production company, Bankable Studios, and would remain involved with the CW reality show “America’s Next Top Model,” which she created and hosts, as well as the ABC reality series “True Beauty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/arts/television/29arts-TYRABANKSANN_BRF.html

The Champagne’s green status comes from an innovation Gasco refers to as “sexual confusion.” Translation: by saturating their fields with female caterpillar pheromones, Pommery’s growers have been able to reduce butterfly mating and egg laying on the vines. They’re also using 20 percent less water to produce the Champagne and have cut their pesticide use by a quarter. Pommery is bottling the bubbly in a lightweight glass container, with no external packaging and a label printed with water-soluble ink, and it’s shipping the cases to the States by boat. The $55 POP Earth has just debuted at Sherry Lehmann in New York and in a handful of stores in Florida, Texas and California; it will be widely available in 2010.

On first viewing, fashion is at best a B-side in a film that grooves on music, heartbreak and the connection between the two. But with the power of hindsight, “High Fidelity” is surprisingly prescient, the ground zero of men’s hipster fashion, from the skinny jeans and hoodies, to the oh-so-clever T-Shirts and, most important, the embracing of “vintage” clothing.

The aides worked for Kenneth Feinberg, the government’s special master for executive compensation, and they were awaiting submissions from companies that had received (and not yet paid back) billions in what federal regulations call “exceptional assistance” from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The government had the authority to set compensation levels at those seven TARP recipients, and this was the companies’ opportunity to plead for salaries and bonuses for each of its top 25 executives. Chrysler Financial and General Motors submitted their proposals — about 2,000-plus pages each — a few days before. Now, like college kids crashing a term paper, the other five — A.I.G., Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup and General Motors Acceptance Corporation — were frantically trying to get their pitches into Treasury’s digital in-box by the Aug. 14 deadline.

On Tuesday, publicists for the show said in a news release that “the shift in dates will allow the production to have a full month of rehearsals at the Beacon.” But reviews for the show’s Chicago production, a vaudeville-style clown act that began performances at the Chicago Theater in November, offered little to laugh at. In The Chicago Tribune, Chris Jones wrote that “Banana Shpeel” was “cold, chaotic, clipped and cacophonous,” and in The Chicago Sun-Times, Hedy Weiss wrote that it could give “a bad name” to “all that was delicious about the classic variety show format of days gone by.” The publicists for “Banana Shpeel,” which is written and directed by David Shiner, said that anyone who bought tickets to a canceled preview of the show would be offered tickets for another performance.

On Tuesday, press representatives for that show said that Casey Nicholaw, who directed and choreographed “The Drowsy Chaperone,” would take over as director of “All About Me.” “All About Me” is scheduled to begin previews at Henry Miller’s Theater on Feb. 19, with an official opening scheduled for March 18.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/theater/30arts-NICHOLAWTAKE_BRF.html

In an e-mail message, Comedy Central said, “We currently have no plans to produce a second season” of “The Jeff Dunham Show,” a half-hour comedy series featuring the titular ventriloquist that had its debut in October. The decision comes as a bit of a surprise given that “Jeff Dunham’s Very Special Christmas Special,” a performance shown on Comedy Central in 2008, is that channel’s most-viewed broadcast ever, drawing 6.6 million viewers, and that the premiere of “The Jeff Dunham Show” was watched by 5.3 million viewers.

In a statement, the government of Seaside Heights, where the first season of “Jersey Shore” was taped over the summer, said it “did not solicit, promote or participate in the filming of this show.” It added that though Seaside Heights gave filming permits to the production company that filmed “Jersey Shore,” it “does not condone any discriminatory remarks against Italian-Americans, domestic violence or the promiscuous and otherwise bad behavior portrayed on the show.” The statement continued: “The people on the show are certainly not indicative of the majority of those who visit, and enjoy the Jersey Shore and Seaside Heights every summer.” Since its debut in November, “Jersey Shore” has been protested by the New Jersey Italian American Legislative Caucus, Unico National, the Order of the Sons of Italy in America and the National Italian-American Foundation, as well as the Jersey Shore Convention and Visitors Bureau. MTV has said that the show “depicts just one aspect of youth culture” and is not intended “to stereotype, discriminate or offend.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/arts/television/30arts-HOMEOFJERSEY_BRF.html

It was so much nicer when hairy simply referred to hirsute, and making fun of the follically challenged was a true spectator sport. But that was the ’90s, when we still had Hillary Clinton to kick around. Now we have Kate Gosselin.

On Wednesday, the library announced that it had added the video to its National Film Registry, among a lineup of 25 films that it deems “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant to be preserved for all time,” it said in a news release. In its citation of “Thriller,” which was directed by John Landis and released in 1983, the library called it “the most famous music video of all time.” Other films announced for the registry included Sidney Lumet‘s “Dog Day Afternoon”; “The Mark of Zorro,” starring Tyrone Power as the heroic swordsman; and William Wyler‘s “Jezebel,” which starred Bette Davis. Among the selections you might not see on Turner Classic Movies are Martin Brest‘s student film “Hot Dogs for Gauguin,” starring Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman; Sally Cruikshank’s cult film “Quasi at the Quackadero”; and “The Muppet Movie.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/thriller-video-is-added-to-national-film-registry/

Reuters reported that the Weinstein Company is scaling back its release plans for “Nine,” Rob Marshall‘s adaptation of the Broadway musical, after it met with poor reviews and low box office grosses. Though “Nine” was showing on about 1,400 screens last weekend, it grossed just $5.5 million and will play on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. “The movie is performing very well on about 890 key screens,” David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, told Reuters. In a review of “Nine” in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that as it strains “to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos” and is “less a homage to Federico Fellini’s ‘8 ½’ (its putative inspiration) than a travesty.” “Nine” was nonetheless nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, including best motion picture (comedy or musical).",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/nine-declines-will-play-in-fewer-theaters/

2009-12-30,Absent From School? Robert Frost Was Keeping Track.,"A forgotten Robert Frost manuscript recently turned up in the basement of a Masonic lodge in Methuen, Mass. It’s not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade in Methuen’s Second Grammar School in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, according to The Boston Globe, and they’re applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frost’s hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didn’t. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadn’t even finished his first semester. But teachers didn’t need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. In fact, teaching was the Frost family business. Frost’s father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frost’s mother, also a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, got hired there, too.

2009-12-31,Listening to Braille," AT 4 O’CLOCK each morning, Laura J. Sloate begins her daily reading. She calls a phone service that reads newspapers aloud in a synthetic voice, and she listens to The Wall Street Journal at 300 words a minute, which is nearly twice the average pace of speech. Later, an assistant reads The Financial Times to her while she uses her computer’s text-to-speech system to play The Economist aloud. She devotes one ear to the paper and the other to the magazine. The managing director of a Wall Street investment management firm, Sloate has been blind since age 6, and although she reads constantly, poring over the news and the economic reports for several hours every morning, she does not use Braille. “Knowledge goes from my ears to my brain, not from my finger to my brain,” she says. As a child she learned how the letters of the alphabet sounded, not how they appeared or felt on the page.

2009-12-31,No-Commoner Obama," There was something discordant, even tinny, about Barack Obama’s attempt to castigate Wall Street last month. No doubt the president was trying to acknowledge and channel the resentments in his own party — and in the country — when he told CBS’s Steve Kroft during a “60 Minutes” interview, “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.” Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington cliché that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the ’40s. Why, listen here: I oughtta pound you — and all your fat-cat pals! ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03FOB-WWLN-t.html

John Collins, Elevator Repair Service’s artistic director, said Monday the estate had given “the go-ahead” for the company to perform the show in New York. Mr. Collins said the Public Theater, New York Theater Workshop and St. Ann’s Warehouse had all expressed interest in producing the show, possibly as early as next fall.

The same thing seems to be happening now with Blu-ray, which was introduced in 2006 but has only become widely affordable in the last year or so, as the price of players has dropped from the $900 range to something on a par with a midrange DVD unit: $200 to $300 for a quite acceptable player, with budget ones available for as little as $90. And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

The movie that brought Kurosawa  and Japanese cinema as a whole  to the attention of the world, “Rashomon” (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: “The Seven Samurai” (1954), “Throne of Blood” (1957), “Yojimbo” (1961), “Sanjuro” (1962) and “Ran” (1985). So it might seem a little strange that Film Forum’s centennial Kurosawa retrospective should begin (on Wednesday) with a nine-day run of the 1949 urban noir “Stray Dog,” in which there isn’t a horse or a castle in sight, and where the weapon of choice is a Colt pistol.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/movies/03kurosawa.html

In a statement on Wednesday the producers blamed “the economic realities of Broadway today” for the quick end. A spokesman said the lead producers were unavailable for an interview about whether the show amounted to a total loss for investors. In recent weeks productions of the musicals “Burn the Floor,” “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Ragtime” and “Shrek” and the plays “Oleanna” and “Superior Donuts” closed or announced the end of their Broadway runs because of weak or unpredictable ticket sales. A pair of productions, “Brighton Beach Memoirs” and “Broadway Bound,” were also quickly canceled in late October because of poor sales. These financial disappointments come as Broadway’s overall box office has been strong this season, thanks to star-driven shows (“A Steady Rain”) and blockbusters like “Wicked.” Some shows close virtually every January, the start of a post-holiday slowdown, but the 2009-10 failed crop is fairly large.

2009-12-31,How Are Things in Glocca Morra? Lousy,"Broadway is once again having a tough winter: the critically acclaimed revival of the musical “Finian’s Rainbow” will close on Jan. 17 after 22 preview and 92 regular performances. (Above, from left, Paige Simunovich, Christopher Fitzgerald and Christopher Borger in the show.) In a statement on Wednesday the producers blamed “the economic realities of Broadway today” for the quick end. A spokesman said the lead producers were unavailable for an interview about whether the show amounted to a total loss for investors. In recent weeks productions of the musicals “Burn the Floor,” “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Ragtime” and “Shrek” and the plays “Oleanna” and “Superior Donuts” closed or announced the end of their Broadway runs because of weak or unpredictable ticket sales. A pair of productions, “Brighton Beach Memoirs” and “Broadway Bound,” were also quickly canceled in late October because of poor sales. These financial disappointments come as Broadway’s overall box office has been strong this season, thanks to star-driven shows (“A Steady Rain”) and blockbusters like “Wicked.” Some shows close virtually every January, the start of a post-holiday slowdown, but the 2009-10 failed crop is fairly large.

2009-12-31,Armed Forces Bowl: Houston (10-3) vs. Air Force (7-5)," In a rematch of last year’s Armed Forces Bowl, Houston and Air Force meet to settle, once and for all, which offense is most likely to send a defensive coordinator into early retirement. The Cougars are your 21st-century team, the one your ungrateful grandchildren like to watch when they’re not playing video games or surfing the Internet. The Falcons, on the other hand, run the same offense you ran in high school, with a playbook that relies on toughness and reliability, not speed and the shotgun snap. When the nation’s best pass offense (Houston) meets the nation’s third-best rush offense (Air Force), it’s tough not to pick sides.

He’s cut from the same cloth as Macon Leary, the immovable author of the travel guides for which “The Accidental Tourist” is titled; as Jeremy Pauling, the reclusive artist whose life is narrated by the cast of women in “Celestial Navigation”; as Barnaby Gaitlin, of “A Patchwork Planet,” employed by “Rent-a-Back” to do other people’s errands.

With skill and spareness, he uses the dozen stories in “A Good Fall” to dramatize lives in which hope has been crushed rather than abandoned, in which the struggle to find a place to live becomes as much a daily battle within the self as it is with society. His characters seem to be in exile not only from the China of their memories and dreams but from their very sense of who they are. Their emotional universe has become as circumscribed as their physical surroundings. Once inhabitants of a sprawling and familiar culture, they are now confined to a few rooms, a few streets.

Conservatives hail Scalia as the founding prophet of their true faith — the Jurisprudence of Original Understanding — and the leader of the opposition to moral relativism and judicial imperialism in the age of Obama. Liberals scorn Scalia as a show-off and intellectual bully who is quick to betray his constitutional principles when they clash with his fervent beliefs as a crusader in the culture wars. It’s hard to write a fair-minded biography of such a polarizing figure, but that’s what Joan Biskupic has done with “American Original.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/Rosen-t.html
2010-01-01,The World Made Flesh,"It’s hard to shake the feeling that Will Self’s peculiar brand of participatory journalism — manifest in his 2007 essay collection “Pyschogeography” and now in this electrifying follow-up, “Psycho Too” — is part of the very machinery that creates both our modern landscapes and our contemporary angst. His work is hyper-reactive, peeling hot off the page in real time, showing us that the more modern we are (jittery with jet lag, poisoned by pollution, attacked by our savaged environment), the more likely we are to sound pre-Victorian. “I was nervy and racked by caffeine and nicotine — one morning I even overdosed on coffee, no mean achievement,” Self confesses in his opening essay, “Walking to The World.” “I had a writerly girlfriend who was more advanced than me — she’d actually completed a novel, and in due course it was published. I found it difficult to get at her: after sweaty midnights, then throughout those cold dawns I struggled to prise apart her thin and resistant white limbs. . . . She turned away from my carefully crafted caresses and I saw peculiar spiral markings on her bare back and stubby neck. Ringworm.

2010-01-01,"Pleasure, Light, Glory","In 2007, The New Yorker printed a cartoon by George Booth, showing a tiny artist on a scaffold, feverishly covering the wall of a vast room, having finished the ceiling. A kibitzer, standing in the doorway, says: “Why, Giambattista Tiepolo, you old so-and-so! Who knew you could paint?” Whatever Booth intended, the cartoon is not without a certain art historical truth, if Roberto Calasso is on the mark. According to him, Tiepolo (1696-1770) was a master of sprezzatura, a virtue much prized in the Renaissance courtier. The word has no exact equivalent in English, but it refers to a kind of nonchalance regarding one’s endowments, in art and in life, so that one just might be a great painter without anyone knowing one could paint. Sprezzatura is discussed by Baldassare Castiglione in “The Book of the Courtier” — a guide to courtly conduct. The courtier must “conceal all art and make whatever is done and said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/Danto-t.html

Genesis is fairly full, though one looks in vain for the passage “In the beginning . . . ,” from which Genesis takes its title in both Hebrew and Greek. The Prophets, from Samuel to Jonah, get about 160 pages, and an anthology drawn from the Writings — notably the Psalms and Job — occupies the remaining half of the book. Each selection has a preface providing scholarly information and justification for the assumptions and procedures of the present translator.

ABC was a distant second, earning its best ratings at 8 with its holiday special, “Happy New Year, Charlie Brown” (5.2 million). Following it ABC’s comedy reruns each delivered under 4.5 million viewers, and at 10 a new episode of “Eastwick” (3.3 million), the lone nonrerun on the night, lagged behind NBC’s repeat of “The Jay Leno Show” (4.4 million) in the hour.

At university, friends who had traveled in the United States came back with more detailed stories, not just of the friendliness of Americans but also of their hospitality (which, in our quaint English way, was translated into something close to gullibility). When I finally got to America myself, I found that not only were the natives friendly and hospitable, they were also incredibly polite. No one tells you this about Americans, but once you notice it, it becomes one of their defining characteristics, especially when they’re abroad.

Last weekend the Federico Fellini-inspired musical with a star-studded cast was showing on 1,412 screens in the United States. This week David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, said it was performing well on 890 screens, and Reuters reported that it would be shown on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. On Wednesday Mr. Glasser said, “At this moment in time there has been no plan between us nor the theater chains that we deal with to cut any theaters.” “Nine” opened in limited release on Dec. 18 in the United States and expanded to wide release on Dec. 25.

2010-01-01,Absent From School? Frost Kept Track,"A forgotten Robert Frost manuscript recently turned up in the basement of a Masonic lodge in Methuen, Mass. It’s not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade at the Second Grammar School in Methuen in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, The Boston Globe reported, and they’re applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frost’s hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didn’t. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadn’t even finished his first semester. But teachers didn’t need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. Teaching was the family business. Frost’s father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frost’s mother, who had been a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and, not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, was hired there too.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/books/01arts-ABSENTFROMSC_BRF.html

The producer, Kevin McCollum, who on Monday announced a closing date of Jan. 3, said on Wednesday that after that news ticket sales had “increased strongly,” and that he and his fellow producers believe there would be solid audience demand for the show through next week. Mr. McCollum said the revival must close Jan. 10 to clear the way for the production following “Ragtime” into the Neil Simon Theater. That production has yet to be announced. Asked what had changed between Monday and Wednesday afternoon, Mr. McCollum said: “It’s demand.

2010-01-01,Van Morrison Denies Report of a New Baby,"An announcement this week that Van Morrison, 64, had become a father again was a hoax posted by hackers on his Web site, according to a statement issued on Thursday in Mr. Morrison’s name and reported by Agence France-Presse. The initial announcement on his official Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that the singer was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III. It added that the baby was the “the spitting image of his daddy” and was a dual citizen of Britain and the United States. On Thursday, a statement issued on Mr. Morrison’s behalf by the public relations company Fleishman-Hillard International said the reports were “completely and utterly without foundation,” and that he had asked his management “to carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my Web site on December 29th last.” The original announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager. But an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, John Saunders, said in an interview with the Irish state radio network that the singer had told him that the story was “completely false,” and that he had not heard of Gigi Lee. Mr. Morrison’s statement added, “For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison, with whom I have two wonderful children.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/van-morrison-denies-report-of-a-new-baby/

Navy has not missed a beat in Ken Niumatalolo’s second season, stringing its streak of eight-win seasons to seven. Perhaps more impressive has been Missouri’s eight-win campaign, which came despite the general perception that the Tigers would struggle mightily attempting to replace players like quarterback Chase Daniel and receiver Jeremy Maclin. Yes, the offense has not quite matched last season’s output. In that case, the fact that Missouri was able reach eight wins speaks volumes about how far the program has come under Coach Gary Pinkel.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/texas-bowl-navy-9-4-vs-missouri-8-4/

2010-01-01,Classic Ad: Honda ‘Cog’,"Honda’s “Cog” commercial was an instant classic when it aired in Britain in 2003. Filmed to market the European Accord, the intricate ad involves no trick photography. There is one moment of computer-enhanced graphics, seen when the muffler rolls across the screen at roughly the one-minute mark. However, CGI is used in this instance only because of both the running time of the commercial and the distance the entire ad would need to reach its conclusion; the ad agency, Wieden & Kennedy, couldn’t find a studio large enough to accommodate the length of the ad, so the same space was used twice. Splitting the commercial into two one-minute pieces greatly increased the odds of an error-free take.",Automobiles,https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/classic-ad-honda-cog/
