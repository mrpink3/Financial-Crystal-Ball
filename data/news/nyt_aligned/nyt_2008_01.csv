2008-01-01,New Year’s Day Bowl Matchups,"This is simply the best day of the year for the college football fan. Intriguing matchups from 11 in the morning until 8 at night. Of course, you can’t sleep on the Fiesta Bowl. Will Hawaii be able to recreate what Boise State did last season? How will the Big Ten fare against tough non-conference opponents? Does Illinois have a shot against U.S.C. in the Rose Bowl? Can Missouri get over being slighted for a B.C.S. game and beat Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl? What kind of game will the Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow have against Michigan in the Capital One Bowl? What’s going on with Darren McFadden? The only way to get to the bottom of any of this is by sitting on your couch and watching a lot of football. What’s so hard about that? The rest of the games are prime-time affairs so this is the last full day of college football until next fall.

2008-01-02,Debatable Democracy," On my flight back to Des Moines today, I read an interesting piece by my colleagues Michael Falcone and Sarah Wheaton about the upcoming debates in New Hampshire. It seems that both Fox and ABC have taken it upon themselves to winnow the field of candidates by excluding those who don’t seem viable at this point. Fox, for instance, is shutting out Ron Paul, despite his having reached fourth place in some recent New Hampshire polls and his having spent a truckload of money on ads in the state. (I swear, you can’t drive three miles in New Hampshire without hearing Ron Paul on the radio; he’s more overplayed than Fergie, albeit easier to listen to.) ABC has decided that if you don’t finish in the top four in Iowa, and you don’t reach five percent in New Hampshire or national polls, then you’re just cluttering up the stage and should watch at home like everyone else.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/debatable-democracy/

The latest sniping on the blogs centered Mr. Obama’s suggestion that Democrats needed to nominate someone whom half the country wouldn’t immediately reject, which, according to Mr. Obama, is what they did in 2000 and again in 2004. This comment wasn’t significantly different from the electability argument that most of the Democrats have made at one time or another, but Mr. Obama’s specific reference to Al Gore and John Kerry was enough to renew dubious allegations that Mr. Obama was, once again, sounding more like a Republican than a Democrat.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/taking-race-out-of-the-race/

2008-01-03,The Title Game: 10 Stories Worth Following,"With Ohio State and Louisiana State having arrived in New Orleans, now is the time to look at 10 story lines worth following heading into the Bowl Championship Series title game Monday.1. The Hat vs. the Vest — L.S.U. Coach Les Miles is nicknamed the Hat because of the stiff brim he wears during games. Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel is known as the Vest because of his typical game-day sweater vest. Miles has become the known as the consummate sideline gambler, and Tressel is usually as conservative as his attire. But few will gives Miles the strategic edge here because Tressel has won too many big games by close margins.2. The Speed Factor — After Florida, like L.S.U. a team in the Southeastern Conference, routed Ohio State in last season’s title game, team speed was cited as a strong factor. That came into play especially with the Gators’ defensive front seven. Expect the speed factor as an advantage for L.S.U. to be discussed excessively leading up to the game.3. The Imperfect Quarterback — Plenty of observers are going to say that this Ohio State team is better than last season’s. Well, it’s not. The disparity at quarterback is enough of a reason, as the Buckeyes traded the Heisman Trophy winner, Troy Smith, for the immobile and not-so-accurate Todd Boeckman. L.S.U. has the solid-but-unspectacular Matt Flynn, which means that whichever quarterback makes the least mistakes will probably win.",Sports,https://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/the-title-game-10-stories-worth-following/

In 1979, it was discovered that vapors from the chemicals were seeping into homes in Endicott and the neighboring town of Union. Michael Maloney, a company spokesman, said I.B.M. began to address the problem in late 2002, and so far has installed vapor remediation systems in more than 440 properties.

The wards will include the kind of ramps, handrails and other fixtures found in Onomichi Prison, in western Japan, now the country’s only prison with a ward for older inmates. The number of older people convicted of mostly nonviolent crimes, like shoplifting, has risen sharply because of a breakdown in family ties and a weakening of the social safety net. From 2000 to 2006, while the total population of Japanese 60 and older increased by 17 percent, prisoners in that age group swelled by 87 percent.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/world/asia/05briefs-japan.html
2008-01-07,More Confusion for Frockmakers,"So it appears that none of the nominees or presenters for the Golden Globes will have to worry about what to wear on Jan. 13. Alan Rosenberg, the president of the Screen Actors Guild, said members would not cross the picket line to attend the awards event, at the Beverly Hilton. There had been some thought, or hope, that the ceremony would go on, without being televised, and we could at least see the peacock display and the nominees could have their moment. But of course that would mean a tremendous loss of revenue. Anyway, it looks like Wanda McDaniel of Armani was on the money when she characterized the appointments she has scheduled with actresses for this weekend as “faux fittings.” Fashion houses and stylists are going through the motions. But what choice do they have? Come tomorrow or Monday, it could be a different story. The SAG statement, on the face of it, was pretty blunt. The next move seems to belong to NBC. Meanwhile, designers are facing deadlines of their own: the Paris couture starts in two weeks, and the N.Y. shows on Feb. 1.

The Buccaneers’ defense is facing a “tall task” in stopping Plaxico Burress, according to The Tribune. The St. Petersburg Times says the “tall order” for Tampa is running back Brandon Jacobs.

By the time the sun finally set that night, it was nearly 9:30; we jumped into the pool, cooled off and suddenly realized we were famished. Improvising with what was at hand, my mother, a superb cook, braised the ombrina in a quick sauce of tomatoes, garlic and saffron, and then, reaching for the nearest bottle, splashed some grappa into the pan  and so a favorite family recipe was born.

2008-01-07,Letters: The Clinton Referendum,"As a lifelong liberal baby boomer, I will say that there is little in Clintonism that conforms to my ideology (Matt Bai, Dec. 23). But what I realized in 1992, as I moved from despising Bill Clinton to actively working on his election campaign, was that he was fundamentally asking me to grow up. He was saying that despite whatever my (or his) utopian dreams for America might be, and no matter how eloquently even the most articulate liberals might convey the short- vs. long-term cost-benefit analysis, the vast majority of Americans were unwilling to go there. The added fact that many liberal candidates were inarticulate in selling this message, while refusing to embrace Clintonesque phrases like “People who work hard and play by the rules” or “End welfare as we know it,” is one reason I’ve spent most of my life with a Republican in the White House. While these expressions don’t conform to my personal ideology (talking about welfare reform is outrageous without a discussion of corporate welfare), their use was an attempt by Clinton to bring back into the Democratic Party what had been lost to “Reagan Democrats.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06letters-t-001.html

Often overlooked by travelers as they sprint their way through Australia’s Big Three tourist attractions — the dazzling metropolis of Sydney, the startlingly beautiful Great Barrier Reef and the historic Aboriginal site of Uluru — this laid-back city is a place that takes some time to appreciate. But Melbourne slowly grows on you as you stroll around the immaculately preserved Victorian-era downtown or along the revitalized Yarra waterfront, or linger over a cup of “flat white” in one of trendy cafes on Chapel Street (where the very mention of the name Starbucks is greeted with horror). And in January, at least, it has something that Sydney and those other places don’t: the Australian Open. This is a country that loves its tennis, and for two weeks, this city feels like a nonstop party, one in which the chances that a local hero may finally take the title are debated each night in the pubs and where even a doubles match played on an outside court and featuring unranked players from the former Eastern Bloc will draw a capacity crowd.

Emperor Qubad Kamran, who cherished his subjects and was a succor to the impecunious in their distress. He was unsurpassed in dispensing justice, and so rigorous in this exercise that the best justice appeared an injustice compared to his decree. Prosperity and affluence thrived in his dominions while wrong and inequity slumbered in death, and, rara avis-like, mendicants and the destitute were extinct in his lands. The wealthy were at a loss to find an object for their charity. The weak and the powerful were equals, and the hawk and the sparrow roosted in the same nest. The young and the old sought one another's pleasure, neither ever deeming himself the sole benefactor. The portals of houses remained open day and night like the eyes of the vigil, for if someone stole even the color of henna from the palm, he was ground in the mill of justice. The thief therefore did not even dream of thieving, and if perchance a wayfarer should come upon someone's property on the road, he took it upon himself to restore it to its owner. Compared with Qubad Kamran's fearlessness, might, and valor, Rustam was the same as a hag most decrepit and cowardly.

Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, has agreed to sell the rights to her book “10-10-10” to Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A person involved in the negotiations said that Scribner paid Ms. Welch a price in the seven figures for world and audio rights to the book. Based on an article Ms. Welch wrote for O, the Oprah Magazine, in 2006, the book offers strategies for making decisions in which people think about what the consequences of a decision will be in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Robert Barnett, a Washington lawyer, negotiated the deal on behalf of Ms. Welch. Nan Graham, editor in chief of Scribner, will edit the book with Samantha Martin. Ms. Welch, who wrote the best-selling “Winning” with Mr. Welch, said she originally thought there wasn’t a book beyond the article. But, she said, “I began to encounter this hunger for people who were using it to play out its nuances.” She said the book would include examples from her own life as well as others she has observed using the “10-10-10” process. Susan Moldow, publisher of Scribner, said that although Ms. Welch’s article might seem sufficient for those who wanted to know about the strategy, Ms. Moldow believed the book would sell well. “The Scarsdale Diet fit on a Xerox-ed sheet that you could fit on the front of a refrigerator,” Ms. Moldow said. “And it sold millions and millions of copies. It’s often true that when something strikes an immediate ‘Aha!,’ you really want to have time to meditate on it and try to get to know more about it.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/arts/08arts-SUZYWELCHSEL_BRF.html

Our mission over the next few days will be to indulge our obsession with sexy electronics, browsing millions of doodads in search of good design. More on that later — you see, we aren’t kidding about millions. The show sprawls for miles inside the mother of all convention centers. The crush of business men, cheesecake spokesmodels and high-tech signage has us thinking we’re in Tokyo, not Nevada. It’s an infamously brutal ordeal, and yesterday we saw people passed out on the floor by day’s end.

Lest we’d forget our surroundings, upon registration all journalists were issued blue and silver backpacks complete with external mesh pockets for water bottles, a waist belt, reflective coating (safety first) and a handy internal organizer that looks awfully pocket-protector like. Rather than wearing it, The Moment opted for the ghetto-chic boom-box shopping bag (above) we snagged at the Lasonic booth.

2008-01-08,Now Booking | Guadeloupe,"(Daniel Barillot/Masterfile)When I learned that an outpost of Barbuto — a stylish restaurant around the corner from my West Village apartment — had opened on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, I scratched my head. What was the chef Jonathan Waxman, known for his seasonal take on traditional Italian dishes, doing on an island that not only has no Italian connection but is also pretty well overlooked by Americans? Turns out the explanation is a fairly simple: when one of Barbuto’s partners, Phil Scotti, was visiting Guadeloupe, he happened to meet Valerie Robein, a well respected local restaurateur who was looking to open a new place, and hatched the idea to back her in a Caribbean-inflected version of Barbuto, with Robein helming the stove and Waxman developing the menu. While Barbuto Guadeloupe’s lasagna with conch or roast chicken with curry aren’t reason enough to make a trip, the restaurant’s opening got me thinking again about an island that is said to combine the typical Caribbean assets of sun and sand with what is, let’s face it, a real rarity in the region: a vibrant food scene, and one that intriguingly blends both Creole and European influences. Guadeloupe is one of the few major islands I haven’t been to, but friends who have tell me the food’s unusually good, from excellent morning pastries in the cafés to fresh grilled fish on the beach to more ambitious fare in the restaurants of Deshaies, the cute town where Barbuto is based. What’s more, although French tourists in high season do pack the coastal resorts of Grand-Terre, Guadeloupe’s eastern half, over on Basse-Terre you can supposedly still get some peace and quiet on the beach in January and February. Even in deepest darkest winter I’m always discouraging my better half from planning Caribbean getaways, in large part because a week without great eating is not my idea of a vacation, but in 2008 I think I’m voting for Guadeloupe. (For an overview of the island, and some hotel and restaurant advice, go here. Been to Guadeloupe?

Returning to Britain from Pakistan two weeks after his mother’s death to resume his first-year studies at Oxford, he gave a battery of feisty answers to reporters who questioned the Pakistan Peoples Party’s decision to pick him as his mother’s successor as party chairman. To a reporter who suggested he had been appointed to the post “like a piece of family furniture,” he said he had not sought it, but added, “It was recognized at this moment in crisis the party needed a close association with my mother through the bloodline.” Asked if he feared for his life, he replied: “How many Bhuttos can you kill? From every house a Bhutto will come.” Noting that the party had selected his father, Asif Ali Zardari, as the party’s co-chairman until he finishes his university degree, he said he would step “gradually and carefully” into politics. He renewed the family’s demands for a United Nations inquiry into his mother’s death and spoke out against American support for the generals who have ruled Pakistan for more than half its 60-year existence. “The problem is that dictatorships breed extremism, and once the U.S. stops supporting dictators, we can successfully tackle extremists,” he said.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/world/europe/09briefs-bhutto.html

It was just for one show, Monday night, and Mr. Letterman’s lead was not sizable, but Mr. Leno had won the first three nights. Their competition resumed last Wednesday, when most of the late-night hosts came back after supporting the writers’ strike for two months. Mr. Leno is working without his writing staff, which is still on strike against his “Tonight Show” on NBC, while Mr. Letterman, above, was able to return with writers to his CBS show because of a separate deal his production company made with the Writers Guild of America. Mr. Letterman has also been able to book the normal roster of movie-star guests; on Monday night he had Tom Hanks, while Mr. Leno had the upstart Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. In the overnight ratings, measuring the country’s 65 largest cities, Mr. Letterman had a 4 rating on Monday to Mr. Leno’s 3.8. (Each point is worth 787,659 households.) But in their shows’ first half-hour, when Mr. Leno is performing a monologue over the opposition of the writers’ guild, he still beat Mr. Letterman, with a 4.5 rating to a 4.3. CBS’s thin victory margin continued on the 12:35 a.m. shows, where Craig Ferguson enjoyed a rare ratings victory over NBC’s Conan O’Brien, with a 1.9 rating to a 1.8 for Mr. O’Brien.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/arts/09arts-AONENIGHTSHI_BRF.html

The museum will open the $56 million Broad Contemporary Art Museum next month, and it has long been speculated that Mr. Broad would donate his collection at least in part to the museum.

Since Day 1 he’s privately and publicly given me a lot of support.” Mr. Govan said that “from the public perspective, I don’t think most people care when they walk in the door whether the museum owns the works or not, as long as they don’t lose them” to private sales.

He was carrying nearly $18,000, a telescopic night sight and a computer hard drive loaded with militant Islamic tracts, the court was told. Prosecutors said that he had trained with jihadist groups in Pakistan linked to Al Qaeda and that his skills included encrypting e-mail messages. The court was also told of e-mail exchanges he had with Samina Malik, known as the “lyrical terrorist,” who received a suspended sentence in November for keeping a library of terrorist material. Ms. Malik, a clerk at a Heathrow newsstand who wrote poetry limning her passion for Islamic militancy, received an e-mail message from Mr. Qureshi asking about security arrangements at Heathrow. According to the prosecution, she replied, “The airport security is as tight as ever.”",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/world/europe/09briefs-jihad.html

2008-01-09,An Advance Look at Spitzer’s Speech,"Updated, 2:41 p.m. | Judging from excerpts released this morning, Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s second State of the State address this afternoon will strike a conciliatory tone and focus heavily on meat-and-potato issues like schools, property taxes and health insurance as he seeks to regain his political footing, turn attention away from the multiple and potentially crippling ethics investigations he still faces, and build the foundation for his second year in office.Such a speech would not be so different from Mr. Spitzer’s first such address a year ago, despite the decline in the governor’s fortunes since then. Mr. Spitzer’s first state of the state address mixed broad reform proposals unpopular with Albany lawmakers (campaign finance reform and non-partisan redistricting) with a large platter of proposals that offered something for everyone, whether more education spending for Democrats or worker’s compensation reform for Republicans.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/an-advance-look-at-spitzers-speech/

2008-01-09,Editor’s Note | “The High Low”,"Only readers of The Moment could have a heated discussion about a cotton sweater. While we love action in our comments section, the editors have some comments of their own regarding Monday’s post, “The High Low | L.L. Bean’s Kingfield Sweater,” which was the initial installment of a feature on chic, affordable goods. First of all, we goofed and published an incorrect image — the author, our fashion associate Melissa Ventosa Martin, liked the sweater in ivory, not the deep red color we showed. The correct color is shown here. [UPDATE: The sweater has sliver buttons, not a zippered neck; photo corrected.] Secondly, a couple of readers commented that they saw the L.L. Bean sweater and immediately thought: “blatant product placement advertising.” We don’t do that. The Times has a policy that keeps advertising separate from editorial content. There is not, however, a Times policy on stylishness — though there should be — so readers should feel free to blow the whistle when they’ve spotted a fashion violation. Those, however, will be hard to come by.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/editors-note-the-high-low/

2008-01-10,"Tata Motors Unveils $2,500 Car","Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors, displaying the Nano in New Delhi on Thursday. (Photo by Money Sharma/European Pressphoto Association)  Video  Tata Motors today took the covers off the world's cheapest car -- the Nano.  Over the past year, Tata has been building hype for a car that would cost a mere 100,000 rupees (roughly $2,500) and bring automotive transportation to the mainstream Indian population. It has been nicknamed the ""People's Car."" Over the course of the New Delhi Auto Expo, which began this week, anticipation had grown to fever pitch.  With the theme from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" playing, Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors drove the small white bubble car onto Tata's show stage, where it joined two others.  The Tata Nano could sell for around $2,500. (Photo by Raveendran/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)  ""They are not concept cars, they are not prototypes,"" Mr. Tata announced when he got out of the car. ""They are the production cars that will roll out of the Singur plant later this year.""  The four-door Nano is a little over 10 feet long and nearly 5 feet wide. It is powered by a 623cc two-cylinder engine at the back of the car. With 33 horsepower, the Nano is capable of 65 miles an hour. Its four small wheels are at the absolute corners of the car to improve handling. There is a small trunk, big enough for a duffel bag.   ""Today, we indeed have a People’s Car, which is affordable and yet built to meet safety requirements and emission norms, to be fuel efficient and low on emissions,"" Mr. Tata added. ""We are happy to present the People’s Car to India and we hope it brings the joy, pride and utility of owning a car to many families who need personal mobility.”  The base price for the Nano will be 120,000 rupees, including road tax and delivery. Higher level models will cost more and come with air-conditioning. Sun visors and radios are extra.  The nearest priced competitor is the Maruti 800, which costs roughly twice as much as the Nano. In comparing the Nano to the Maruti 800, Mr. Tata said, ""It is 8 percent smaller -- bumper to bumper -- and has 21 percent larger seating capacity than Maruti 800.""  The Hindustan Times reports reactions from a couple of Tata's competitors, Maruti and Hyundai:   Jagdish Khattar, a former head of Maruti 800 manufacturer Maruti Udyog Ltd., says it's too early to say whether the Nano will overtake the original.  ""It's a good product but it's still too early to say whether it will overtake the 800 because it caters to a totally new market segment,"" he said while watching a live telecast of Tata's press conference after unveiling of the Nano.  But clearly, at least one other manufacturer was worried.  An official of Hyundai Motors, which unveiled an LPG version of its Santro Thursday, was more circumspect.  ""We definitely see it as impacting our sales,"" he said in halting English, preferring to maintain anonymity.    Anand Mahindra, managing director for Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors' primary competitor, said before the unveiling, ""I think it's a moment of history and I'm delighted an Indian company is leading the way.""  The Nano will go on sale in India later this year with an initial production run of 250,000 a year. Tata says it will offer the Nano in other emerging markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa within four years.

The court increased Mr. Tharaldsen’s sentence by one year, to 10 ½ years, and Mr. Skjold’s sentence by six months, to six years.

They never fail to bring a lump to the throat  at least to mine. In his new book, “Freedom for the Thought That We Hate,” Lewis offers a similarly heroic account of how courageous judges in the 20th century created the modern First Amendment by prohibiting the government from banning offensive speech, except to prevent a threat of serious and imminent harm. “Many of the great advances in the quality  the decency  of American society were initiated by judges,” he writes. “The truth is that bold judicial decisions have made the country what it is.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/books/review/Rosen-t.html

As for Milton’s epic, it’s in “normal” English, but its blank verse is so densely learned, so syntactically complicated and philosophically obscure, that it’s almost never read outside college courses. Even Samuel Johnson, writing 100 years after Milton, said: “‘Paradise Lost’ is one of the books which the reader admires and lays down, and forgets to take up again.

Such a book is the annual issuing of Kevin Zraly’s “Windows on the World Complete Wine Course.” According to Zraly, these volumes have sold some 2.5 million copies since the first edition appeared in 1985. Zraly became the cellar master at Windows on the World the year the restaurant opened in 1976. He was 25 at the time. The books grew out of the wine courses he’s taught ever since. “Windows on the World is a hard place for me to talk about,” Zraly said recently. “I was there for 25 years, from the day it opened until Sept. 11, 2001.” He would have been in 1 World Trade Center on the day it fell, he said, had he not stayed home because of his oldest son’s birthday. “After 9/11, I had no desire to do anything, or to teach anymore,” he said. “But many people wanted me to carry on the legacy. Really, the only things now left of Windows on the World are the wine courses and my books.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/books/review/13tbr.html

There are many who seem to be impressed with the argument that God exists simply because He says He does in a much extolled tome that He allegedly inspired. Many others subscribe with varying degrees of conviction to more sophisticated arguments for God, while atheists and agnostics find none of the arguments persuasive.

Will they don, together with civilian dress, that veneration for the laws and respect for protective forms . . . ? To them the unarmed class appears vulgar and ignoble, laws are superfluous subtleties, the forms of social life just so many insupportable delays.—Benjamin Constant, Swiss, 1767–1830But all was not right with the spirit of the men who came back. Something was wrong. They put on civilian clothes again, looked to their mothers and wives very much like the young men who had gone. . . . But they had not come back the same men. Something had altered in them. They were subject to queer moods, queer tempers, fits of profound depression alternating with a restless desire for pleasure. Many of them were easily moved to passion when they lost control of themselves. Many were bitter in their speech, violent in opinion, frightening. For some time while they drew their unemployment pensions, they did not make any effort to get work for the future. . . . Young soldiers who had been very skilled with machine-guns, trench-mortars, hand-grenades, found that they were classed with the ranks of unskilled labor in civil life.—Philip Gibbs, British, 1920",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/us/excerpt-odysseus.html

2008-01-14,Milan Élan: Pssst!,"This week, the fashion circus pitches its tent in Milan, where the men’s Fall 2008 shows are taking place. If you’re like us, there’s probably only so much talk about “cashmere 8-yarn tweed in ecru” you can take. Thankfully, a lot of the action during fashion week happens off the catwalk. The big scandale of the week has been over Tommy Fazio, the men’s fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, being unceremoniously asked to vacate his front-row seat at Saturday night’s Versace show. We spoke to Fazio afterwards who said that he was asked by a clipboard Nazi to make room for one of Beyonce’s posse. Not surprisingly, Fazio put away the check book and instantly canceled his Versace showroom appointment. Oops….Speaking of Beyonce, the singer and her boo, Jay-Z, walked in and straight out of the GQ party on Saturday when they realized there was no VIP room for them…Lots of “aw-shucks, he so deserves it” talk about John Bartlett‘s being given a lifeline by Liz Claiborne, which has signed Bartlett to oversee its men’s line…The buzz late Sunday night had the Spice Girls showing up en masse to today’s Roberto Cavalli show. (It would make sense as their concert in London last week may as well have been a Cavalli advertorial, given the number of shout-outs Victoria Beckham gave the designer.) We’ll let you know later if the rumor pans out to be true. Till then, baci.Read all of The Moment’s coverage of the Milan men’s fashion shows and after-hours shenanigans.

That book, published by Scholastic Press, is also different from the more traditional short picture books for young children that win the Caldecott medal. “Hugo Cabret” is a novel told in blocks of text interspersed with 284 pages of black-and-white drawings.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/arts/15arts-CHILDRENSBOO_BRF.html

Although “Terminator” benefited from following a football game on Fox that attracted more than 35 million viewers during the 7 p.m. hour, no other scripted series debut on any broadcast network has done better in the 18-to-49 set in three years.

The reason was sharply higher fuel costs. Delta Air Lines raised its round-trip fares by $50 immediately after United’s move. American Airlines also posted $50 round-trip increases on 55 percent of its route system, though ""conspicuously absent"" are increases on its routes that overlap with many Southwest Airlines routes, said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com. Then on Monday, Northwest Airlines also joined in the $50 increase on most of its routes. Continental Airlines, which initially raised fares by $50 on some routes on Friday, withdrew the increases Monday morning, but Mr. Seaney said it was unclear whether Continental might reverse course again soon. This was the second broad fare increase in 2008, and the 10th since last Labor Day, Mr. Seaney said, adding: ""It seems the legacy airlines, United in particular, are forgoing the nickel-and-dime strategy of increases every few weeks and are going for the whole enchilada at one time.""",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/business/15memopad.html

2008-01-15,'30 Ways of Looking at Hillary',"In an episode of ""The Simpsons"" from a few years ago, Bart gets a glimpse thirty years into the future and sees that his sister Lisa has been elected president. The show doesn't make a lot of fuss over the notion of a woman commander in chief (in fact, in an aside we learn that Lisa is ""the first straight woman president."") But it's impossible not to notice that President Simpson looks a lot like Hillary Clinton: her spiky hairdo has been smooshed down into a power-helmet; she wears monochrome pants suits and a string of pearls. She is intelligent and earnest, and she has a problem with authenticity. Bart, who has grown into a middle-aged slacker with a ponytail, ends up playing Bill to Lisa's Hillary; he saves the day by smooth-talking a mob of angry world leaders who have converged on the White House. At one point he says, ""I coulda been president, but I'm too real.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/books/chapters/1st-chapter-30-ways-of-looking-at-hillary.html

In recent years, the city seemed insulated from dips in the national real estate market, posting several double-digit gains, including an 18 percent increase in values last year. But now, according to data from the tentative annual assessment roll, which will largely determine taxes for the fiscal year beginning in July, declining values of small homes outside Manhattan are pulling down the overall market as the effects of the country’s mortgage trouble take hold.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/flat-housing-market-adds-to-tax-pressure/

In his later years, he had become a pariah in the chess world because of his strident anti-Americanism and antisemitism, but even that could not detract from his contributions and impact on the chess board. Although he essentially quit chess after winning the title in 1972 in his epic match with Boris Spassky (coming back only in 1992 for another match with Spassky that drew worldwide interest), he raised interest in chess to unprecedented levels and changed the game profoundly. Garry Kasparov, the former world champion, in the fourth book of his series “My Great Predecessors,” a volume largely devoted to Fischer, wrote, “He abandoned the game at the age of 29, and only really played for just ten years, but he succeeded in achieving more in chess than anyone else!”",Crosswords & Games,https://gambit.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/bobby-fischer-is-dead-at-64/

2008-01-18,Rocco Landesman Answers Your Broadway Questions,"We recently solicited your questions for Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, and threw in a few of our own as well. Reading his answers below, you can see why he is considered not only one of Broadway's best producers, but also one of the most astute. Thanks to Rocco, and to all of you for the questions.  Q: What will Broadway look like in 20 years?   A: This is a live, hand-made industry where the product is created new and live each night, just as it was 50 years ago. As such, in twenty years, it should look much as it does now -- except that Nathan Lane will look notably older.   Q: What factors contribute to the high price of Broadway tickets? Theater rents? Union salaries? Audience expectations of an onstage spectacle? Are these costs increasing? Do rising costs lead to less risk-taking and more middle-of-the-road, lowest-common-denominator fare on Broadway?   A: The issue in our business is that we lack both an economy of scale and mechanization. We can't make a million, or even a thousand copies of the same movie. As I wrote earlier, the product is handmade and repeated live each night. The sets and costumes are custom made. The actors have to be live. It is labor intensive to the Nth degree, and as those costs rise, so do ticket prices. There is really no productivity gain through the technology boom. Actors and stagehands keep getting more money, and the costs of marketing a show seem to keep going up exponentially. Then, of course, the higher the cost, the more risk averse the producer and investors become. So yes, there is inevitably some decline in venturesomeness. Better to stick with the tried and true, or the show with the widest possible audience.   Q: What's the current trend in Broadway attendance? Why do people still go to the theater when it's so much more expensive than other forms of entertainment?   A: Broadway attendance has been trending up. Attendance by New Yorkers has leveled off, but that has been more than made up for by tourists, both American and international. There are many more competing forms of entertainment, but there's really no replacement for a live experience. It is really not replicable through any technology or alternate form of delivery.   Q: Tell us about the economics of hiring a star for a Broadway show versus a non-star. As much as stars draw box office, they also spike the budget and, I assume, limit a potentially long run. Is it worth it?   A: Some shows, especially plays, need a star in order to sell tickets. Of course, from the producers' standpoint, it's best when the show is the star. The Producers ran for more than three years after the departure of Lane and Matthew Broderick.   Q: Where do Broadway audiences come from (geographically)? What's a surprising place that a lot of customers come from?   A: In general terms, the audience for plays is from New York and for musicals, after the first year or so, from outside New York. Which is one reason why musicals usually run much longer than plays.   Q: Assuming that the vast majority of Broadway customers come from out of town, why is there so much Broadway advertising in New York City — on buses, e.g.?   A: Because purchase decisions are often made after the customers arrive. And it would be impossible to advertise in 300 cities.   Q: What's the state of Broadway ticket scalping, and what's your position on it?   A: The problem for years has been that the only people who really score with a hit show have been the scalpers. When we instituted the $400 ticket for The Producers, we started to address this problem. In the new system, the price is printed on the ticket, and the money actually goes to the people responsible for the show -- the investors, the creative team, etc. -- instead of to the ticket brokers. We are in favor of a free market system where the market ultimately sets the price on premium tickets.   Q: You were the first producer to charge $100 for a single ticket, for The Producers. What was the impact and response?   A: It had no effect whatsoever on demand. We could have sold all the tickets we could print.   Q: How true to life is The Producers?   Max Bialystock was based on a real life producer that Mel Brooks knew personally. Current producers are not all crooks -- at least, most of them aren't.   Q: So much of Broadway seems to be derived from movies today (partly thanks to The Producers, which has done it better than anyone before or since). Is this a healthy trend? More broadly, will people still produce original plays and musicals in 5 or 10 years, or will originality be left to off- and off-off-Broadway? What message should playwrights take from this trend?   A: The creators of musicals are always looking for stories. Once upon a time, the stories were found in short stories, novels, plays, and other literary sources. Now, many of the stories are in movies. This is a natural and healthy migration, and the actual process [of creating Broadway shows] hasn't changed.   Q: It seems that in the last few years, there have been a number of shows that exist primarily to showcase the music of one particular artist or band (e.g., Billy Joel, ABBA, Elvis). Is this a trend for the future as well? Should we expect to see ""Madonna: The Musical"" in the next five to ten years?   A: I truly hope not. But the success of Jersey Boys will probably extend the cycle of so-called jukebox musicals. Usually, if I like the music, I will like the musical, but there has been a wide spectrum of quality in these shows. Compare Good Vibrations with Smokey Joe's Cafe or Jersey Boys.   Q: How well do these so-called jukebox musicals do when measured against traditional musicals?   A: Smokey Joe's Cafe was the longest running review in history. I expect it will be surpassed by Jersey Boys. Generally, these shows are more successful financially because their costs are much lower. The casts are usually smaller and they don't depend on stars or expensive scenery.   Q: If Jujamcyn scores a big advance sale, how do you invest the money?   A: In certificates of deposit.   Q: If you weren't a successful producer and had nothing to do with the entertainment industry, and you had a daughter in high school, would you encourage her to pursue a career on Broadway?   A: I once asked my wife how she would feel if one of our three sons turned out to be gay. She thought for a while, and answered that she didn't think she'd have a problem with it, but she would be upset if one of them decided to become an actor. It is a very tough life, one in which you have little control over your own career.   Q: What benchmarks do you use to judge the success of a show?   A: Critical response and financial reward.   Q: Do you lose more sleep when you first started producing than you do now?   A: Yes. At first, everything was life and death, because that's true at the beginning of a career. My whole career stems from the success of my first show, Big River. After you've had a few hits, everything is not at stake with each show. So I still worry, but I don't lose sleep.  Q: When were you a professional gambler? What kind of gambling did you do?  A: Horse racing. I never bet in casinos.   Q: Do you feel that Broadway is better off after going through a ""Disneyfication""?   A: I don't accept the term ""Disneyfication."" They are producers like everyone else, with their own taste and point of view. The more the merrier.   Q: How do you ""break in"" as a director or performer? How do you then balance family, children, auditions, rehearsals, etc.?   A: I can't really help on this one. It's very hard, and you have to be incredibly determined -- to be incapable of not doing it. There is no real work/life balancing -- the profession tends to be all-consuming.  Q: How is your relationship with your backstage crew post-strike, and how much do you rely on them?   A: Our stagehands are highly skilled, which is why we never tried to run shows without them during the strike. My relationships -- in many cases, friendships -- with the stagehands I work with was good before the strike, and continues to be good after it. We each did what we felt we had to do.   Q: What is Jerzy Kosinski doing?  A: You'll have to ask God. Or maybe the other guy.   Q: What was the purpose behind the $20 million strike fund that the producers have been accumulating over the last 4 years? Presumably, it was established to keep the shows running during a strike -- which didn't happen.   A: If all of the producers' requests had been granted during the IATSE negotiations, resulting in lowering expenses for the producers, would ticket prices have been reduced? They would have stabilized. That in itself is progress. ",Blogs,https://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/blogs/18freakonomics-rocco-la2235.html

Of course, Clinton is a persuasive man, but his tirade would have been more convincing had anyone in the Clinton camp complained about Nevada’s system before the powerful culinary unions endorsed Barack Obama. And that probably explains why a judge in Nevada ruled Thursday that the caucuses should go on as planned. (Clinton’s opposition to the plan would also have been more credible, by the way, had Hillary Rodham Clinton herself not noted, after the Iowa caucuses, that a lot of Iowa’s shift workers hadn’t been able to take part.

Now it’s reality-check time. After early contests in friendlier territories, the nomination fight moves this week into the heart of the Old South, where the inspiring story line of a woman dueling with an African-American will collide, at last, with another side of history. While much of the primary electorate in South Carolina comprises traditional Democrats (black voters, college-town liberals, etc.), the candidates will nonetheless encounter, in a broader way, a less-welcoming political culture in a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic nominee since Jimmy Carter.

2008-01-21,Inside the List,"BEST AND BRIGHTEST I: Thirty-five years ago this week, in January of 1973, the No. 1 nonfiction title was “The Best and the Brightest,” by David Halberstam, a wide-screen, gossip-packed account of the snaky path to war in Vietnam. The book’s reviews were essentially positive, with one notable exception: Mary McCarthy’s scorched-earth put-down in The New York Review of Books. (While reading Halberstam’s book, McCarthy wrote, she was “unable to stay awake for more than a few paragraphs at a go without ferocious application of will power, tea, coffee, drinks of water, propping open of eyelids, pinches, strolls about the room.” And that’s a friendly passage.) McCarthy’s 7,000-word review didn’t stop the book from selling; it remained on the hardcover list for 36 weeks, and Halberstam sold the paperback rights for $700,000. As John Leonard, then the Book Review’s editor, wrote at the time, the paperback money “presumably makes a nice poultice to apply to the wounds of pride.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/20tbr.html

2008-01-21,The Education of Ben Bernanke," Ben Bernanke’s first exposure to monetary policy was reading the works of Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate. That was 30 years ago, when Bernanke was a graduate student at M.I.T., and he has been studying central banking ever since. By the time President Bush nominated him to run the Federal Reserve, at the end of 2005, Bernanke knew more about central banking than any economist alive. On virtually every topic of significance  how to prevent deflationary panics, for instance, or to gauge the effect of Fed moves on stock-market prices  Bernanke wrote one of the seminal papers. He championed ideas for improving communications between the Fed  whose previous chairman, Alan Greenspan, spoke in riddles  and the public, believing that clearer guidance about the Fed’s aims would help the economy run more smoothly. And having devoted much of his career to studying the causes of the Great Depression, Bernanke was the academic expert on how to prevent financial crises from spinning out of control and threatening the general economy. One line from his “Essays on the Great Depression” sounds especially prescient today: “To the extent that bank panics interfere with normal flows of credit, they may affect the performance of the real economy.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20Ben-Bernanke-t.html

Much of his work  which includes 13 books of poetry and seven of plays as well as a volume of essays  reflects his experience with colonial rule and its aftermath. “How choose,” he asked in an early poem, “Between this Africa and the English tongue I love? / Betray them both, or give back what they give?” This collection, edited by the Jamaican poet Edward Baugh, represents every stage of Walcott’s long career, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1992. “Walcott has captured his islands with a lushness and richness rare in our poetry,” our reviewer, William Logan, said. “No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

2008-01-21,A Cutting Tradition," When a girl is taken  usually by her mother  to a free circumcision event held each spring in Bandung, Indonesia, she is handed over to a small group of women who, swiftly and yet with apparent affection, cut off a small piece of her genitals. Sponsored by the Assalaam Foundation, an Islamic educational and social-services organization, circumcisions take place in a prayer center or an emptied-out elementary-school classroom where desks are pushed together and covered with sheets and a pillow to serve as makeshift beds. The procedure takes several minutes. There is little blood involved. Afterward, the girl’s genital area is swabbed with the antiseptic Betadine. She is then helped back into her underwear and returned to a waiting area, where she’s given a small, celebratory gift  some fruit or a donated piece of clothing  and offered a cup of milk for refreshment. She has now joined a quiet majority in Indonesia, where, according to a 2003 study by the Population Council, an international research group, 96 percent of families surveyed reported that their daughters had undergone some form of circumcision by the time they reached 14.

Those who did make it inside underwent further taxonomy: A hierarchy of wrist bands told them where they could and could not go. For the wired but unwashed who made it in to the main mosh, 50’s imperative that they put their hands in the air was met with compliance, in part because there was no where else to put them. Servers had to be flanked front and back by burly security guys with winking flashlights to make their way. Smoke from tobacco and other products filled the place while toes were crushed and egos were in conflict. “I would not have given that wrist band to you if I had known you were going to be such a jerk about it,” shouted one guy to another. Six cameras panned live shots, feeding back to the crowd what they already knew. They were there, they saw the thing, they had juice. “What’s up, Park City?” 50 Cent shouted. Only you man, only you.

The peg for the interview was a summit held by the Clinton Global Initiative, one of the former president’s many philanthropic activities. Wallace asked several questions about the initiative, but four minutes into the interview also brought up criticisms of the Clinton administration’s counterterrorism policies that had been aired in Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Lawrence Wright’s history of Al Qaeda, “The Looming Tower.” Whereupon Clinton went … ballistic. His face turned red. His voice rose. He tore into Wallace, accusing the veteran journalist, who over the decades has worked for several “mainstream” networks and whose credibility seldom has been questioned, of being a right-wing shill. He claimed the “neocons” who now say he did too little to capture or kill Osama bin Laden had in fact during the 1990s been highly critical of his administration’s emphasis on counterterrorism, that they “thought I was too obsessed with bin Laden” and “had no meetings on bin Laden for nine months after I left office.” ",Opinion,https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/bill-clintons-strategic-emotion/

Then, Mike Huckabee told South Carolinians that it was nobody‘s business but theirs if they wanted to wallpaper their public buildings with the Confederate flag. And now here comes Rudolph W. Giuliani to show these amateurs how it’s done. Campaigning in his make-or-break state of Florida last week, Mr. Giuliani released a statement promising to “make space a priority.” Apparently, America is facing a crisis far greater than health care or education reform: when the current fleet of space shuttles is retired in 2010, it’s going to take as much as five years—five years, people!—before we can send another guy into orbit. “This is not acceptable,” Mr. Giuliani said. “America should be number one in space.

It’s a sci-fi chamber with aromatherapy, music and video, although the big selling point is the dry water massage. “Your body is covered with a thin, silky sheet,” explained Ella Frenkel, a chiropractor who runs the company and had traveled to the home of a Manhattan customer to demonstrate the Spa Capsule. “There is an arm full of water jets” inside the lid, she said, “so that the water is not exposed, but you can actually feel the jets.”Sara Herbert-Galloway, a socialite and former model who is the owner of this particular Spa Capsule, a jelly-red number with yellow leather upholstery purchased for $29,000, whispered, “My friends call it the Orgasmatron.” It had been set up in her lushly appointed living room, where it blended in as smoothly as a Ferrari. One lies in the Spa Capsule face down, head supported on a doughnut-shaped headrest, top right, but “your head is completely outside the capsule, so it is nonclaustrophobic,” Ms. Frenkel said. A video can be viewed, aromas can be sniffed and a touch screen allows the user to operate the lid. Ms. Herbert-Galloway said she uses a relaxation video supplied by the company, with abstract ’70s-style images and a soothing soundtrack, delivered through Bose headphones. Her aroma of choice is lavender. For this reporter’s trial run, eucalyptus was suggested  good for the sinuses, it was said  although inside the Spa Capsule, no scent was detectable. The massage was very nice, but the sound system could not eradicate the steady sloshing of the water jets. It was like being in the tender embrace of a washing machine set on the gentle cycle. Had the reporter paid $29,000 she might have been a little stressed. Ms. Herbert-Galloway said the sound did not trouble her.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/garden/24spa.html

But it appears that most of the measures that would do that — benefits to the unemployed, food stamps, aid to state and local governments — are being bargained away. Even the tax credit is apparently not fully refundable, so those who need it most, and are most likely to spend it, won’t get the full amount.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/stimulus-disappointment/

The Glass House — the organization that oversees Philip Johnson’s iconic weekend house in New Canaan, Conn., which is owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation — recently sent several thousand potential donors a beautifully-photographed, catalog-like booklet called “Projects,” to present restoration, educational and outreach projects for which it needs donations. The rewards, apart from the satisfaction of doing your bit for the Modernist cause, aren’t bad either. Contribute $25,000 to the conservation of a Donald Judd concrete sculpture on the property, and you get a tour of both the Glass House and of Judd Foundation properties in Marfa, Texas. “Instead of a gift, we give you an experience,” says Christy MacLear, the Glass House’s executive director. Michael Bierut, a partner in the firm Pentagram (and the designer of the logo and signage for The Times’s new building), designed the booklet. The catalog format makes for a more intimate experience, he explains — and so does the unusual choice of cover photograph, an image of the house’s kitchen with the glorious landscape beyond. “We had to de-familiarize people with the house. It was a chance to take them a bit by surprise.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/philanthropic-transparency-the-glass-house/

In a statement Thursday her British publicist said Ms. Winehouse, right, “has come to understand that she requires specialist treatment to continue her ongoing recovery from drug addiction and prepare for her planned appearance” at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 10 in Los Angeles, where she is up for six awards, and is the only nominee to be considered in all four marquee categories. But the statement also said she had canceled a planned appearance at the NRJ Music Awards in Cannes, France, on Saturday, the latest in a string of events she has scratched from her schedule amid her own legal troubles and those of her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who is in jail for “perverting the cause of justice” after a pub brawl. Ms. Winehouse’s appearance on the Grammy show is still seen as a long shot, not only because of uncertainty about her ability to perform but also because of doubts about her effort to secure a visa to travel to the United States given an arrest for marijuana possession in Norway in October. But the publicist, Chris Goodman, said, “If she’s well enough to do it, she certainly wants to do it.” He added that in terms of her recovery, “What better incentive than six nominations?” The latest blow to what had seemed a rising career came in the form of a grainy video posted on the Web site of the British tabloid The Sun. In the clip Ms. Winehouse is seen lighting a glass pipe and smoking what The Sun reported is crack cocaine. A copy of the video on YouTube has been viewed more than 800,000 times, according to the Web site. In an interview after the video had surfaced, Neil Portnow, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, which organizes the Grammy Awards, left open the possibility that Ms. Winehouse might yet manage to appear. Mr. Portnow said her representatives had notified the academy “that they still are working on all of the possibilities of making this happen, and we want to give them an opportunity to work on that.” He added, “Things happen and things change, right up to and into showtime.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/arts/25arts-AMYWINEHOUSE_BRF.html

Eventually, Mr. Hermesh said, he removed “Frank” to prevent further damage but offered to put it up again elsewhere. “They canceled my contract, refused to pay me for having made the piece and then refused to pay for repairs,” he said. So he sued and won. “I’m very happy with it,” he said of the outcome. “It’s not the actual dollar value, although this really hurt me financially. It was the exoneration, I guess.” “Frank” has been bought by a winery in nearby Naramata and given safe surroundings.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/arts/25arts-ARTISTCOMPEN_BRF.html

Lueck finds. The netting proved a lifesaver last week, when a construction worker fell from the 42nd floor of the Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel being built at Varick and Spring Streets, and was snared by a net that protruded 10 feet from the side of the building about two floors below where he was working. He was then lowered to the ground safely. But for another worker, who also fell from the 42nd floor, a similar net proved useless. For reasons that remain under investigation, he fell to the ground and died. For developers, contractors and construction workers, the accident in SoHo on Jan. 15 has raised questions about whether the city’s requirement for safety netting, which has generally been applauded, goes far enough.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/how-effective-are-safety-nets-at-construction-sites/

2008-01-25,"Now Booking | Riviera Maya, Mexico","Way back in 1997, Rosewood Hotels & Resorts made a big splash in Mexico with Las Ventanas al Paraíso in Los Cabos, a stunning beachfront resort that in the decade since has become an icon in the world of luxury hotels. In December, following a long gestation and much anticipation, the company finally “soft opened” its second property in the country, Rosewood Mayakobá on the Riviera Maya; the resort’s official, full-scale launch is next week. Rosewood is the second company to open in the big mixed-use residential-hotel-golf community north of Playa del Carmen called Mayakobá. (Fairmont was the first, and a Viceroy and Banyan Tree are slated to open later this year.) Though we haven’t yet booked ourselves in, early reports suggest the new Rosewood is a winner. Of the 128 suites — all done in a stylish, pared-down style using local limestone and woods from renewable sources — the 16 on the beach are obviously prime real estate, though the remainder, arranged along a network of lagoons that wend their way through mangrove forest, provide a novel take on the typical Mexican resort experience: each has its own dock, and guests are transported around the property via silent boats (silent, to avoid disturbing the wildlife). All rooms have a private plunge pool, and there’s a staff of 40 butlers to take care of your needs. The nice thing about the Riviera Maya in general, of course, is that there’s more to do than just loll on the beach — you’ve got Mayan ruins at Tulum; some decent shopping, restaurants and bars in Playa del Carmen and coral reef for diving and snorkeling offshore — but looking at the images from Rosewood, we think it might be hard to tear yourself away.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/now-booking-riviera-maya-mexico/

Democrats believe they can hit a reset button, and Republicans believe muscular moralism is the way to go. It’s as if the first decade of the 21st century didn’t happen  and almost as if history itself doesn’t happen. But the distribution of power in the world has fundamentally altered over the two presidential terms of George W. Bush, both because of his policies and, more significant, despite them.

2008-01-28,Doesn’t Scare Easily,"Reading horror stories pretty inevitably involves the mental operation Samuel Taylor Coleridge called the “willing suspension of disbelief,” and Lord knows it can be a challenge, even for genre-hardened veterans. The hero of “Best New Horror,” the opening story in Joe Hill’s inventive collection, 20TH CENTURY GHOSTS (Morrow/HarperCollins, $24.95), is a professional anthologist who has read, by his own count, “almost 10,000 stories of horror and the supernatural” in the course of compiling 16 annual volumes of “America’s Best New Horror,” and his willing-suspension-of-disbelief fatigue has become so acute that he can no longer finish most of the stories that land on his desk. His ennui is almost French in its intensity: “He felt weak at the thought of reading another story about vampires having sex with other vampires. He tried to struggle through Lovecraft pastiches, but at the first painfully serious reference to the Elder Gods, he felt some important part of him going numb inside, the way a foot or a hand will go to sleep when the circulation is cut off. He feared the part of him being numbed was his soul.” I think we’ve all been there.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/books/review/Rafferty-t.html

2008-01-28,Paperback Row,"THE GOOD FIGHT: Why Liberals  and Only Liberals  Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again, by Peter Beinart. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) Beinart (pictured at right), a columnist at Time magazine and The Washington Post, urges Democrats to prepare for the future by remembering the past  the heyday of cold-war liberalism during the 1940s. He urges a foreign policy based on humility, restraint and generous foreign aid to fragile democracies, as well as domestic policies that embody the humane values we promote abroad. Beinart “writes clearly and concisely, with a pellucid intelligence,” our reviewer, Joe Klein, said. The political scientist Thomas F. Schaller’s advice to the Democrats focuses on tactics. In WHISTLING PAST DIXIE: How Democrats Can Win Without the South (Simon & Schuster, $15), he argues that the party should “let go of their electoral past and begin building a non-Southern majority coalition” by solidifying the coastal states and the Midwest and reaching out to the Southwest. The recipient of Beinart’s and Schaller’s advice may be Hillary Clinton. In A WOMAN IN CHARGE: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton (Vintage, $15.95), Carl Bernstein, who helped break the Watergate story, surveys Clinton’s career. Bernstein “has written a serious, energetically researched and largely fluent book,” Michiko Kakutani said in The Times, “often sympathetic toward the former first lady as an individual ... just as often critical of judgment calls she’s made on both policy and politics.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

2008-01-28,In the Name of the Father," For years, Julian Schnabel had “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” by Jean-Dominique Bauby, on his bookshelf. The autobiography of a man with “locked-in syndrome,” a rare form of stroke that paralyzes the body while the mind remains intact and vital, Bauby’s memoir, which was published in 1997, having been painstakingly dictated by a blink of his left eye when the correct letter of the alphabet was read aloud, is a glimpse into the other side of consciousness. It is a surprisingly ebullient, liberated view of a man approaching what would seem to be a terrible fate. When Schnabel eventually read the book  it was pushed on him by the performance artist Laurie Anderson when she was staying at his house in Montauk and she grabbed it from the stacks  he began to see the cinematic possibilities, the ways in which reality could be blurred with memories and dreams. Schnabel’s two other films, “Basquiat” and “Before Night Falls,” were both about artists and the ambitions that can thwart the creative process. “Diving Bell” could be, among other things, a further, more intense examination of how the creative mind can take flight, even in the face of a grim reality.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/magazine/27Style-t.html

2008-01-28,Il Miglior Fabbro,"T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were the “Odd Couple” of 20th-century poetry, a most unlikely pair who between them rewrote the rules for everyone else. Eliot was Felix, of course: fussy, clerkish, conservative in both politics and religion, so somber that as a young man he sometimes dabbed his face with powder to make himself look even grayer. And Pound was Oscar: a yapper, provocateur and shameless self-promoter with a radical opinion on just about anything; he signed his name with a caricature of a gadfly and strode about London in the years before World War I wearing an earring, a sombrero and trousers made of green billiard cloth. From our perspective, almost a hundred years later, it’s hard to imagine that these two ever sat in the same room, let alone shared meals, friends, manuscripts. Eliot is now an almost churchly figure in our cultural imagination, the prelate of modernism, while Pound, if we bother to think of him at all, is remembered mostly as an embarrassment  a crank, a Fascist and anti-Semite confined to an asylum.

His people, the Bahima, are thought to have migrated into the hilly grasslands of western Uganda more than a thousand years ago, alongside a hardy breed of longhorns known as the Ankole. For centuries, man and beast subsisted there in a tight symbiotic embrace. Mugira’s nomadic ancestors wandered in search of fresh pasture for their cattle, which in turn provided them with milk. It is only within the last few generations that most Bahima have accepted the concept of private property. Mugira’s family lives on a 500-acre ranch, and one sunny day in November, the wiry 26-year-old showed me around, explaining, with some sadness but more pragmatism, why the Ankole breed that sustained his forebears for so many generations is now being driven to extinction.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/magazine/27cow-t.html

His albums, he said, “are about what’s going on in the world and what’s going on in my life at the time.” Although Mr. Kravitz writes, arranges, sings and produces his albums, he recently managed in his spare time to appear in the coming indie film “Push” and to work with his design firm to create a piano lounge in the Delano Hotel in Miami. In Los Angeles to rehearse for a tour that will span South America and Canada this spring, Europe over the summer and the United States in the fall, Mr. Kravitz spoke on the phone with Winter Miller about what he’s listening to and watching.

2008-01-28,SAG Awards: Stars in the Flesh. Pot.,"Seeing as he will be covering the SAG awards from his New Jersey basement, the Bagger could act like the annual ego-fest is a sideshow, but this year, it is the show, at least so far. In Hollywood, you need pomp for a little circumstance and the SAG awards have plenty: Real actual stars in full plumage in their natural habitat, which on a red carpet hunted at every turn by cameras. The fluff, the froth, the whole “actors choosing actors” conceit? Mad, jolly fun in a town that could use a little. In each of the last two years, the Bagger has ended up at the People party afterwards and it is a doozey. Last year, he spent part of the evening with the “Little Miss Sunshine” contingent. The directors, Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, were having the time of their lives, partly because they won ensemble and partly because they were as surprised and happy as anyone else. Who will be doing the hugging and thanking and crying tonight? Will it be “Juno” that will hop in the LMS van and ride to glory or will the Coen’s continue their roll, which picked up a bit more heat last night from the DGA? Picks later. (Sasha Stone points out that a bit of a cloud hanging over the SAG Awards, but there still be plenty of wattage under the canopy.)",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/sag-awards-stars-in-the-flesh-pot/

The only flag the Screen Actors Guild flies with any consistency is one with a finger to the wind on it. Harsh? Well, in 1953, the Screen Actors Guild decided to take a rigorous stand on blacklisting: Some 96 percent of their members voted in favor of making members sign a “loyalty oath.” They said they were sorry, oh, 50 years later.

But there’s just one small unhelpful fact: Only one of this year’s nominees for the best picture Oscars is in the running for the SAG ensemble award, which is how the actors settle on a best picture. “3:10 to Yuma,” “Hairspray,” “American Gangster,” and “Into the Wild” did not make it to the dance for the Big 5.

Tina Fey, who won for her role as Liz Lemon in “30 Rock,” compared her acting skills to “a hat rack” and was the first speaker of the night to address a strike that was very much on the mind of the audience of the event.

One clanky note though: The SAG’s self-congratulatory infomercials, about the unions fight for racial tolerance, safety and worker dignity. All nice stuff, but as long as they are doing a historical tick-tock, they might want to mention that when the pall of a black-list hug over America, the union capitulated, throwing may of their colleagues under a bus.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/confessions-of-a-ninny/

The speeches have been short and tasteful, the strike and the effect it has had on working people in the industry was present, but did not overwhelm. Broadcast on TBS and TNT, the SAG awards will not provide the kind of marketing firepower that the Globes might have, had they not been downsized by the threat of pickets. The industry is in a middle place, with uncertainty abounding and no clear path to settlement at the negotiating table.

Oh, and a little slash of fabric representing the bodice & cleavage of a dress. The camera angles could be lascivious. In the strapless contingent were Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Vanessa Williams, Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Oh, and Teri Hatcher. Though I couldn’t see all of her dress, Ellen Paige looked smart, I thought, in a black Zac Posen dress with a v-neck and short kimono sleeves, especially with her smooth hair.

Nice tidy night, good balance of glam and gravitas. And how ’bout that Josh Brolin?

2008-01-28,Diary Revisits American Tragedy,"On March 30, 1908, Chester Gillette, 25, was executed at Auburn State Prison in New York for the murder of his pregnant lover, Grace Brown, on an Adirondack lake in 1906. His sensational trial inspired the Theodore Dreiser novel “An American Tragedy,” the 1951 film “A Place in the Sun” and an opera staged by the Metropolitan Opera. Now, as the 100th anniversary of Gillette’s electrocution approaches, Hamilton College has published “The Prison Diary and Letters of Chester Gillette,” taken from papers donated to the college last year by Gillette’s grandniece, Marlynn McWade-Murray, The Associated Press reported. The editors, Jack Sherman and Craig Brandon, said Gillette’s writings offer neither an explicit admission of guilt nor any clear assertion of innocence, but they do provide a window into his character and his metamorphosis in prison from a blithe youth into an introspective, compassionate, religious adult. In the penultimate entry in the diary, Gillette wrote: “In all that I have done, I hope I have done as men would have me do. I know that I am right with God, and that is the all important thing.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/arts/28arts-DIARYREVISIT_BRF.html

Ford’s novel “The Sportswriter” strikingly recalls “The Moviegoer,” starting with that compound noun in the title. In 2005, Ford was a guest on the National Public Radio program “The Connection,” for a series called “The Book That Changed My Life.” The book Ford chose to talk about was indeed “The Moviegoer.” It was a fine discussion. Ford views the book’s dynamic as “a renewing experience” and Binx as a hero “headed toward the light” and “trying to find a vocabulary for affirmation, trying to find the institutions in life that will let him like life better and be better at it.” It intrigues me that Ford never mentions religion as a force in the novel. This despite the fact that the exchange features a cameo call-in by “Linda,” evidently Linda Whitney Hobson, who wrote an accessible little book, “Understanding Walker Percy,” in which Percy’s Christianity is the single most important critical thread. You can still listen to the program in the online archives of the Boston public radio station WBUR.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/richard-ford-on-book-that-changed-his-life/

This one-hour series will be the first original drama on Starz, which will produce it with Lionsgate. Production is expected to begin in the spring, with a premiere by the end of the year. “Crash” received the Oscar for best picture in 2006. Among the film’s producers, Paul Haggis, Bobby Moresco, Bob Yari, Don Cheadle, Mark R. Harris and Tom Nunan will take part in the television series. “This series will present an opportunity to delve into many subjects, not just race relations in L.A.,” Mr. Cheadle, right, who co-starred in the film, said in a news release. “I don’t think you can do 13 episodes on that subject and keep people interested. The challenge will be to craft the series characters in such a way as to get beneath the skin that supposedly differentiates them and create entertaining story lines that show the hurdles and obstacles we all struggle to overcome day to day.” Starz is available in 16 million homes. Lionsgate, which also produces “Weeds” for the premium channel Showtime, reached an interim agreement with the Writers Guild of America last week.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/arts/29arts-CRASHINSTARZ_BRF.html

The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, centers on complex terms in Mr. Wolf’s contract. NBC argues that Mr. Wolf, right, is misinterpreting them to demand millions of dollars in executive-producer fees for two years after his shows leave the air. NBC’s interpretation is that if the network produces a sufficient number of episodes it can fulfill the contract and not owe Mr. Wolf for work he is no longer doing. Mr. Wolf’s side contends that the contract guarantees the money as a kind of termination payment, or “kill fee.” No matter when NBC decides to end his series, Mr. Wolf argues, he is to be paid for 48 more episodes. NBC asks that if the court finds the contract language ambiguous, it direct that the errors be fixed rather than force NBC to pay the money. A representative of Mr. Wolf, who like other Hollywood writers is on strike, said he was traveling on Tuesday and could not be reached. But Mr. Wolf issued a statement last week saying: “NBC Universal is trying to rewrite an existing contract. Apparently, our partner is willing to commission rewrites during the strike.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/arts/30arts-NBCSUESDICKW_BRF.html

2008-01-30,A Former Mayor’s Failed Endgame in Florida,"For the New York papers, the focus today is on Rudolph W.

In The Times, Michael Powell and Michael Cooper dissect what is called a “dizzying free-fall” for the ex-mayor, noting that just a few months ago a senior Giuliani aide had surveyed the Republican field and said: “I don’t believe this can be taken from us. Now that I have that locked up, I can go do battle elsewhere.”Instead, hubris and strategic miscalculations plagued his campaign, political observers say. For one, he allowed a tight coterie of New York aides, none with national political experience, to run much of his campaign. And while he accumulated a fat war chest — he had $16.6 million on hand at the end of September, more than Mitt Romney ($9.5 million) or Senator John McCain ($3.2 million) — he spent vast sums on direct mail instead of building strong organizations on the ground in South Carolina and New Hampshire.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/a-former-mayors-failed-endgame-in-florida/

In my youth, women were forever collecting the equivalent of iron deer, or auditioning and being discovered and going off to Biloxi or maybe even New York or Busch Gardens. They certainly did — and do — a fair share of “going off to Natchez,” of checking in and out of nuthouses, and all such activities were usually reported or repeated at the dinner table.

2008-01-31,The Day After," We’re at that stage of a campaign now where once serious contenders for the nominations of their parties are forced to cancel events and huddle with their families, to make those difficult calls to friends and supporters who already knew it was coming, to direct their own final scenes on the national stage. It is, in a sense, like planning your own funeral, and I’m sure it feels that way, or at least for a while. I can remember sitting with Bill Bradley in his bare campaign office just after his withdrawal speech in 2000. Everyone was already gone except for a few loyal staff members and the last two Secret Service agents guarding the door. All the noise from all the rallies had subsided, and all that remained were a few empty cubicles and the occasional unanswered phone. I will never forget how one of the agents, checking his watch, offered the candidate a ride home before the final shift came to an end. It’s not just the candidate, though, who suffers the trauma. For all the people who work on a campaign, who share cramped apartments with other true believers and keep most of their belongings in a car, the end really does feel like The End. I stood in the Ohio headquarters of America Coming Together, the massive Democratic voter turnout operation, as John Kerry and John Edwards gave their concession speech the day after the 2004 election. A smart young organizer was weeping on her boss’s shoulder. I knew that if she lived to be 90, no matter what else she did or how successfully, the memory of that moment would probably still feel like a kick in the gut.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/the-day-after/
