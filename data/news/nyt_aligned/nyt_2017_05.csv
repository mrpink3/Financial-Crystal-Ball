Women are being fired from their jobs and their bank accounts frozen, with funds being transferred to their husbands or closest male kin. The people at the march are similar to Offred — young, urbane, angry at the shape the world is in now that oppression is hurting them directly. Soon the march turns violent as the protesters are shot at. A down-tempo version of “Heart of Glass” by Blondie slinks through this sequence, which culminates with Offred and Moira taking cover in a vacant cafe. A bomb goes off blowing the windows out and glass cascades down. The song fits neither the mood nor the message of the scene and its placement demonstrates for me how “The Handmaid’s Tale” can swing wildly from blisteringly powerful to absolutely leaden thanks to decisions that feel artless.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/the-handmaids-tale-episode-3-recap.html

Now, with his wife, Tali, he is opening a full-service restaurant. “We had requests from customers who wanted to be able to dine, to sit down,” he said. The result is 72 seats in the garment district, with spots at a counter facing the team of chefs, and a bar that will serve beer, wine and sake by the glass, the bottle and in cocktails this summer. Dove-gray recycled wood is a prominent feature, as are the high ceilings. The sushi is largely made of grains, vegetables and fruit. There are also rice-paper wraps, salads, noodle bowls, dumplings and a new line of soups. And the offerings have broader appeal: Mr. Vaknin said a recent informal survey of his customers indicated that about 60 percent of them were not vegetarian or vegan. Takeout and catering are available.

Like her predecessors, this redheaded Anne (Amybeth McNulty) begins her new life as a spitfire and a romantic, chattering on in exclamatory sentences, thrilling at the beauty of apple trees and bridling at the notion of washing dishes. But soon the series turns somber in a very 21st-century (and perhaps more relatable) way, with bullying at the hands of Anne’s future husband, prompting the book’s smashed-slate scene, and flashbacks of abuse by her previous employers, who ultimately return her to the orphanage, where her only friend is her reflection in the glass. “I like imagining better than remembering,” Anne says.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/arts/television/anne-with-an-e-on-netflix-reimagines-a-darker-green-gables.html

Most of the ragtag futuristic fighters who powered through Vol 1. three years ago are back on board and led by Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a cheerily roguish type who calls himself Star-Lord.

The language they speak has no precise number words, not even “one” or “two.” It also lacks what linguists call grammatical number — terms like “both,” from which you can tell the speaker is referring to two of something.

What can be left to overshare? Still, here comes a Jenner memoir with the tattletale title “The Secrets of My Life” (written with Buzz Bissinger and new at No. 8 in hardcover nonfiction), and it turns out to be plenty revealing. Jenner discusses her ambivalence at becoming a macho role model after winning decathlon gold as Bruce Jenner, along with her early experiences cross-dressing and her attempts to reconcile her gender identity in a succession of doomed marriages. She also relates a funny anecdote about appearing on a Bob Hope television special after the Olympics, for a skit that required dressing in drag. “I have to be careful not to show too much enthusiasm, so I play it cool,"" she remembers. “Our wigs and dresses are purposely ridiculous. But the red heels I think not only look good on me but also fit, so I steal them after the show.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/books/review/caitlyn-jenners-stolen-red-shoes-and-other-revelations.html

2017-05-09,The Intimacy Behind Jazz’s Seminal Image,"It’s quite easy to tell the story of how certain photographs were taken, to link what’s going on within the frame to the situation or circumstances around it. In the case of Robert Capa’s gray, sea-drenched images of soldiers struggling to shore on D-Day, we know the precise historical moment they depict, what happened before and after. In other instances, photographs contain an implied narrative that can be expanded and expounded upon. Here all we have are two faces in tight close-up, so slurred and dimly lit that the picture barely succeeds in the most basic task of photographic portraiture: to enable us to identify whom we are looking at. Would you be able to see that this is John Coltrane and Ben Webster without being told? Given the uncertainty, it makes sense to begin by mentioning what the photograph is not.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/magazine/the-intimacy-behind-jazzs-seminal-image.html

His father transferred Asare when he was 14 to Milton Academy, which awarded Asare a scholarship that covered tuition and board. His parents still had to take out loans worth about $20,000 for his living expenses. But the academy set Asare up for future success.

A small nonprofit, it is as devoted to the margins of culture as its downtown counterparts. But instead of focusing on overlooked artists, its mission is the neglected medium of books, foremost writing, illustrating, printing and collecting — but only foremost. The last Grolier show concerned engravings of United States securities. Its next, opening Wednesday, May 17, examines modern calligraphy in the West, which is more obscure than medieval or Asian. “The Calligraphy Revival: 1906 to 2016” traces its resurgence from the British scribe Edward Johnston (1872-1944) and the German type designer Rudolf Koch (1876-1934) through their students’ work and beyond. The 70 calligraphers include the polymath and type designer Hermann Zapf (1918-2015); he learned calligraphy from manuals by Johnston and Koch. Remember: “Calli” is Greek for beautiful.

And, well, why should it be or how could it be, given who’s behind the camera? The director Guy Ritchie likes his action fast and frenetic, and he’s more focused on how things look — mostly, he’s chasing that certain something called cool — than in narrative coherency or plausibility.

2017-05-12,The Beautifully Flawed Work of Emerging Ceramists,"At first sight, Alana Wilson’s vases, jugs and chalices look about 3,000 years old. Inspired by Neolithic Japanese, Cycladic and African traditions, her ceramics have the pockmarked surface of bleached-out brain coral and the faint hue of artifacts that have been buried in the ground for millennia. The Australian artist, who works in a small studio outside Sydney overlooking Tamarama beach, near the famous swells of Bondi, achieves this distinctive look with a mixture of modern and ancient methods. She eschews an electric potter’s wheel for the “coiling” method, an antediluvian technique in which small bands of clay are slowly stacked on top of one another to create a shape. Wilson then coats them, rather unorthodoxly, with an arsenal of naturally toxic chemicals — lithium, barium and silicon carbide — that slowly eat away at the special kind of terracotta clay she employs; and bits of paper embedded in the material burn during the firing process, creating her work’s signature porosity. “I’ve been experimenting with sea salt recently,” says the 28-year-old mischievously. “It melts and practically destroys everything it touches which I quite like.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/t-magazine/emerging-ceramists-alana-wilson-romy-northover-dora-alvamora-good-akiko-hirai.html

Open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and presented in conjunction with the Drawing Center’s exhibition “Exploratory Works: Drawings From the Department of Tropical Research Field Expeditions,” the zoo’s station welcomes young visitors to the adventure with art materials, activity cards and marine specimens. Every hour, from 11 a.m. through 2 p.m., Beebe and one of his artists, Else Bostelmann, will join them in the form of actors from the Wildlife Theater Troupe, who will conduct a 30-minute science and drawing program. It culminates with sketching some wonderful live models: the zoo’s sea lions. LAUREL GRAEBER",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/arts/things-to-do-in-nyc-glass-menagerie-mothers-day.html

2017-05-12,A Different Kind of Sports Novel,"PUCKISH: Sports novels can sell. Over the past decade or so, the hardcover fiction list has included books about baseball (Chad Harbach’s “The Art of Fielding”) and football (John Grisham’s “Playing for Pizza”) and basketball (E. Lynn Harris’s “Basketball Jones”) — even bicycle racing, which was central to Chris Cleave’s “Gold.” But hockey novels have been in short supply, as Keith Gessen noted in a 2006 essay for the Book Review: “What is needed now,” he argued, “for the sake of both hockey and literature, is more hockey literature.” Enter Fredrik Backman, whose novel “Beartown,” at No. 10 in its second week on the list, concerns a Swedish youth league team and its fraught place in a declining town. As popular Swedish exports go, Backman is up there with Abba and Stieg Larsson; his debut, “A Man Called Ove,” has sold millions of copies, and most of his subsequent books have also been best sellers. But in “Beartown” he’s not skating by (so to speak) on his name alone; he really has a feel for the sport, and for sports in general. “Hockey is just a silly little game,” he writes. “We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. …But what the hell else is life made of?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/books/review/a-different-kind-of-sports-novel.html

First opened in 1854, the bar’s crowd was no less motley when the author Rafe Bartholomew started going there as a child in the 1980s. There, his father would tend bar while the regulars helped babysit Rafe. “I was 5, 6, 7 years old, and every weekend I got to spend a few hours hanging out with grown men,” Bartholomew writes in “Two and Two: McSorley’s, My Dad, and Me,” his new memoir. “Not just any men, but characters — workingmen, old men, homeless men, policemen and firemen.” He would eventually follow the path of his father, Geoffrey, and work behind the bar. “Two and Two” is about Geoffrey’s 45-year career as a bartender; the deep and abiding bond between father and son; and the stories and people that made McSorley’s a city institution. Below, Bartholomew tells us what led him to write such a personal story, what surprises he encountered in the process and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/books/rafe-bartholomew-two-and-two-mcsorleys-interview.html

The series is based on the author and filmmaker Chris Kraus’s autobiographical, experimental first novel of the same name, which has become a feminist cult classic since its publication in 1997. Both versions follow Chris (Kathryn Hahn), a failing filmmaker, as she falls suddenly and completely in love with a mysterious intellectual named Dick (a character inspired, in the book, by the media theorist Dick Hebdige and played, on the show, by Kevin Bacon). In a perverse twist, she is egged on in her obsession by her husband, Dick’s colleague Sylvère (Griffin Dunne), who is based on Kraus’s real-life ex, Sylvère Lotringer. Structured as a series of letters to Dick, the book reads more like an essay on love, art and philosophy than like a traditional novel — which makes it a pretty unlikely candidate for adaptation as a sitcom.",Watching,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/watching/i-love-dick-review-roundup-good-articles.html

It had been 11 years since her sex reassignment surgery and, not coincidentally, 11 years since our reunion after a quarter-century of estrangement. In the days after her death, I combed through her house, a forbidding concrete bunker perched high in the Buda Hills, inspecting the many closets, cabinets and storerooms she’d kept locked. I was looking for a clue to a life just passed, an inkling of who she was. Under the eaves behind two sets of deadbolts, and tucked inside steel cases, storage bins and acetate envelopes, I discovered an arsenal of cameras – Hasselblad, Rolleiflex, Leica, Olympus, a bellows camera built into a mahogany frame – lenses, cables, filters, tripods, along with developing sinks and processing trays, a wall-mounted enlarger and giant drum print-dryer, relics of her commercial photo business in Manhattan in the 1980s, her documentary work of the Brazilian interior in the 1950s, and her first attempts at filmmaking in Hungary in the 1930s. And, in acetate envelopes and slide trays, thousands of Tri-X negatives and Ektachrome slides, along with contact sheets and prints, chronicling year by year and in meticulous order, the minutiae of Faludi family life. That is: my life, and my life with my father. ",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/susan-faludi-in-my-world-photographs-lie/

And even this new benefit, the Excelsior Scholarship, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law last month, helps only a small fraction of the state’s residents — households earning less than $125,000 that are not already covered by financial aid — and their grants convert into loans unless graduates both live and work in the state for as many years as they benefited from the program.

Some of the Labs showed only passing interest in the trapped sausage and spent more time exploring the rest of the room. But others stayed laser-focused on the treat. One in particular, a black Labrador named Ash, went into a tizzy, banging the cage around and not giving up until he pried the tape loose with his teeth and ate the hot dog.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/magazine/the-genetics-of-pooched-out-pooches.html

Surely, I thought, otters would be happy if they had a soft place to sleep, could play, go exploring, make a friend (that would be me) and swim around in rivers catching fish. The fish were my only concession to the notion that an otter’s needs might not match my own.

Not one of them, including great statesmen and professional spokespeople, seems capable of making a well-formed, nonmortifying statement in public. But behind closed doors, where they’re free to express their endless contempt for one another, their speech is athletic and limber and just about symphonically profane. They’re masters of high-speed sophistry and self-serving rationalizations, and they threaten one another as if the power of threats lies mainly in how elegantly expressed they are — as when the former president in “Veep,” Selina Meyer, tells a congressman, “I will destroy you in ways that are so creative, they will honor me for it at the Kennedy Center.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/magazine/new-sentences-from-veep-season-6-episode-2.html

Conchs scraped around the sand, levitating on burnt orange claws. The hermits buried and exhumed themselves at unpredictable intervals. They outgrew and shed their bodies and each time this happened, it was magic. It made bodies seem fungible, an armature you could shuck and swap. They moved like a glacial version of the con man’s shell game. They were master vanishers, digging down into the sandy substratum. Mine sometimes disappeared for days. Or they relocated at night, and I would spend a morning beaming affection at an empty shell. This was a little embarrassing.

We thought it reminded us of something, but we couldn’t put our finger on it — until we spent some time in the archives of YouTube, watching old clips of “Celebrity Apprentice.” It turns out that hints of Donald Trump’s style of governance are right there in the boardroom scenes: not just his penchant for sudden dismissals, but also how much he relishes performing the role of a powerful person. We invited Emily Nussbaum, the Pulitzer Prize-winning television critic for The New Yorker to talk with us about Trump’s obsession with TV and what shows we should consider watching in the wake of Trump. We take a look at the rise of fictional television shows that seem to speak to our new political reality — shows like “Veep,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Leftovers.” Those last two are set in dystopian versions of the future, where abnormal, unsettling events begin to seem ordinary, and they prompted us to ask a question: When we turn to art to explain to us a world that feels increasingly unreal, what can it tell us?",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/podcasts/what-tv-should-we-watch-in-the-trump-era-emily-nussbaum-has-some-ideas.html

So I’ll dish instead. Who knew that during Rice’s days as secretary of state, the former Libyan strongman Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was besotted with her? “I support my darling black African woman,” he said of Rice during a 2007 interview with the network Al Jazeera. “I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders.” He added: “Yes, Leezza, Leezza, Leezza. … I love her very much.” So when Rice included Tripoli on a visit to the Middle East the following year, there were some decidedly uncomfortable undercurrents in her meeting with Qaddafi. “It had been a really strange trip,” she writes, setting aside her usual diplomacy. “I awoke with that sensation one has after a bizarre dream. Did I really just sit in his kitchen and have dinner with his female security guards who many believe are also his daughters? Did he really give me a video — with pictures of me set to music — called ‘Black Flower in the White House’? O.K. Whatever his weird affection for you, thank the Lord, that visit is over.

2017-05-19,A Cultural Compendium: 7 Things We’re Into Right Now,"Frank Lloyd Wright was funny about his birthday, occasionally fudging the year in favor of youth, but 2017 marks his actual sesquicentennial — to be celebrated with various exhibitions across the country. Here in New York, Wright aficionados who might otherwise be straining their necks at the Guggenheim will head to MoMA for “Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive,” not your typical monograph of the architect’s masterpieces. Curator Barry Bergdoll invited a handpicked group of scholars to explore the vast Wright archive that the museum comanages with Columbia’s Avery Library, then organized the show around the objects they found most compelling. The historian Jennifer Gray used a little-known Wright-designed logo for a conservation group to examine his ideas about the prairie. Ken Tadashi Oshima, a specialist on East-West influences in design, found an old book of images of the Imperial Hotel, with rickshaws and automobiles pictured out front. “It’s not some big statement,” Bergdoll says. “More a kaleidoscope of facets meant to open new lines of inquiry.” — KATE GUADAGNINO",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/t-magazine/frank-lloyd-wright-elyse-graham-talitha.html

Phrased a little differently — Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman call these novelists and essayists “storytellers” — this is the question the two editors of KINGDOM OF OLIVES AND ASH: Writers Confront the Occupation (Harper Perennial, paper, $16.99) decided to pose on the occupation’s 50th anniversary. (Moriel Rothman-Zecher was associate editor.) They gathered their friends, most of whom, they admit, had never given the occupation “more than a glancing consideration,” and took them on weeklong tours of East Jerusalem, the village of Susiya in the south Hebron hills and the cities of Hebron and Ramallah, all flash points where Israeli control over Palestinian lives can be felt acutely. The result is an exhausting collection of essays. And with a few strong exceptions — like the pieces by Dave Eggers, Rachel Kushner and Waldman herself — they are what you might expect: fairly superficial, full of unearned authority and exhibitionist empathy.

This question is never asked outright in “War Machine,” a new Netflix original movie starring Brad Pitt and written and directed by David Michôd, but it’s a substantial thematic undercarriage of this satire. The movie, which has its theatrical and TV premiere on Friday, May 26, is adapted from Michael Hastings’s 2012 book, “The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan.” Mr. Pitt plays Gen. Glen McMahon, an arguably brilliant career soldier whose first words on touching down in Afghanistan, where he has a new mission circa 2009, are “Let’s go win this thing!” McMahon approaches the task of transforming Afghan hearts and minds with enthusiasm and boundless ignorance. The terrifying hubris depicted in the movie is ever more pertinent given that President Trump has recently signaled an intention to increase the American military presence in Afghanistan.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/movies/war-machine-netflix-brad-pitt-afghanistan.html

Glen McMahon, the four-star general he is playing, has no doubts on that score.

To insist otherwise is a variation on the sunk cost fallacy.

They all insisted I had to write a novel about one of those courts, because the magnitude of the cases, the diplomatic entanglements and the personal politics combined to make fertile ground. Usually, when people tell me there’s a huge injustice I must write about, it’s their divorce proceedings. But a war-crimes court seemed like a unique setting that I never forgot.” He added, “I knew far less than I should have about the sad history of the Bosnian conflict, but I soon came to see those killing fields as a provocative stage for a story about the law.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/books/review/a-courtroom-novelist-tackles-war-crimes-in-bosnia.html

2017-05-26,10 Things to Do in NYC Now,"This archly witty English pop-rock band has gained a fervent — and growing — American audience in the last two years, thanks in part to the reputation of its outspoken lead singer, Matthew Healy.

As had been clear many times before — but was forgotten in the early part of the 2000s — the reluctant girl in the corner or the punk rebel was just as capable of making world-shaping pop as the popular extrovert.
