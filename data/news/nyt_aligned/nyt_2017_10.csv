2017-10-02,Guggenheim Talk Focuses on Legendary Dancer’s Cookbook,"The ballerina Tanaquil Le Clercq, a star of the New York City Ballet and a wife of George Balanchine, was an accomplished cook. Polio ended her dancing career in 1956, so she spent more time in the kitchen and eventually wrote “The Ballet Cook Book” (Stein and Day) with recipes and anecdotes from the files of leading figures in the world of dance at that time. The more than 90 contributors include Alicia Alonso, Erik Bruhn, Leslie Caron, Margot Fonteyn, Serge Lifar, Arthur Mitchell and Edward Villella. It’s an international cookbook with a strong Russian influence and photographs of dancers, not food. Ballet buffs would love it, but for now, it’s out of print. Next month, for the book’s 50th anniversary, there will be a program about it at the Guggenheim Museum, with the dancers Jacques d’Amboise, Allegra Kent, Jared Angle and Adrian Danchig-Waring in a conversation with Meryl Rosofsky, a food scholar. Some dishes from the book will also be served on a special menu (not included in the program price) at the museum’s restaurant, the Wright: Nov. 5 and 6, 7:30 p.m., $40 ($35 for museum members), worksandprocess.org; the Wright, 212-427-5690, opentable.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/dining/ballet-cook-book-tanaquil-le-clercq-guggenheim.html

2017-10-03,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: David Friend on ‘The Naughty Nineties’,"The schisms of the 1960s, which opened up when many baby boomers were teenagers or in the first stages of adulthood, are commonly used as a Rosetta stone to decipher current political and cultural battles in the United States. In “The Naughty Nineties,” David Friend turns instead to the 1990s, when those same baby boomers were in positions of greater power: from Bill Clinton in the White House to Howard Stern on the radio to the producers Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray on MTV with “The Real World.” Friend finds that the decade’s sexual and political attitudes shaped, in ways both progressive and conservative, the ground we stand on today. On one side are widespread moves to the left on social issues. “But a good case can be made,” he also writes, that Donald J. Trump’s presidency “would never have been possible had the 1990s not normalized and formalized personal branding, reality programming, 24/7 news, tabloid scandal coverage and online self-expression.” Below, Friend discusses how Viagra inspired the book, how the election of Trump changed his plans and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/books/tell-us-5-things-about-your-book-david-friend-on-the-naughty-nineties.html

2017-10-03,Hwa Yuan Szechuan From the Owners of Shorty Tang Noodles Opens,"HWA YUAN SZECHUAN Chen Lieh Tang is back to opening restaurants. His father, Yun Fa Tang, known as Shorty, arrived in New York in 1963 and introduced Sichuan food and notably sesame noodles. Chen Lien Tang put the family name on many restaurants before retiring to spend time in China, New York and Taiwan. But he recently became bored. “He’s getting old, and he felt the need to do it again, one last time,” said his son, James Tang, who is also involved in the business. Last spring, the family opened Shorty Tang Noodles in Chelsea. Now, they have installed a grand restaurant seating about 350 on three floors in the family-owned building (formerly the Bank of China) next door to where Shorty Tang, who died at 50, opened his original Hwa Yuan restaurant in 1968. (The restaurant closed in the 1980s.) The elder Mr. Tang, now 66, designed the new restaurant, seeing to every detail, including richly hand-carved doors he brought from China. “I’m going to remake history here,” he said. “Sesame noodles, fine scallion pancakes, Sichuan kung pao chicken done simply, the way it’s supposed to be, just with chiles and garlic.” He will also serve some banquet dishes on a menu that leans toward Sichuan heat but not exclusively so. He plans to try new ideas, he said, because “times have changed.” Among them are raw-bar selections displayed at one end of the bar in the front dining room, and cheesecake for dessert. (Opens Thursday): 42 East Broadway (Catherine Street), 212-966-6002.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/dining/shorty-tang-noodles-nyc-restaurant-openings.html

My biggest change is that I feel the need to reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians. The wall has always been there, but sometimes there have been too many holes in it. One legitimate criticism of the political press over the last two decades has been the appearance of coziness between people in the media and the political elite.

2017-10-04,"My Obsession With the Necks, the Greatest Trio on Earth","Ideally this article would start with a single-word sentence. A single short word. A short word like “quiet” or, in musical terminology, “piano.” That word, “piano,” would be repeated. It would be repeated several times. As it was repeated, we would become conscious that it had changed, that in the process of being repeated it had changed, quietly, had expanded from quiet to quietly, imperceptibly. And as this imperceptible change became perceptible, so we would notice that another deeper aspect of its meaning — also simple — was making itself felt: a basic figure of speech, a bass figure. Alongside piano and bass something else would emerge, a rustle so faint it could be nothing, a nothing stirring into something that sounds breeze-scattered: a rattle, dimly perceived, moving so slowly it will have to develop significantly before it can be recognized — measured — by the form of time known, since the dawn of time, as rhythm and, later, as percussion. At some point — though the key point is that we will not be able to say with certainty when, where or how this point was achieved — piano, bass and drums will have moved either into a deep propulsive groove or into a maelstrom of relentless intensity. And then, after an extended stretch of time, the music will subside — or plunge — back to the silence from which it emerged faintly, quietly. So this article, ideally, would unfold in a single, long paragraph as a way of approximating the experience of listening to a typical performance by the Necks, the Australian trio who, for the last dozen years, have obsessed me to the point of mania.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/magazine/my-obsession-with-the-necks-the-greatest-trio-on-earth.html

The simple storefront has a wall of glass dividing it from the kitchen. Mr. Stephen studied pastry in his native Melbourne, Australia, before burnishing his skills in Paris and San Francisco. Aron Tzimas, also Australian, is his business partner in this venture. The doughnuts, made from brioche dough, ooze creamy fillings and sport jaunty garnishes; the infinitely layered croissants are large, often filled and also festooned with edible decorations. Some come filled with fruit and are baked a second time. Savory croissants — stuffed with smoked salmon and cream cheese with “everything” seasoning on top — are an item that’s beginning to have traction in New York. They also make a version filled with pastrami, mustard and sauerkraut.

It gives us an excuse to revisit the reason “Get Out” has been one of the year’s major movies: It articulates the previously inarticulable about race. Then we consider the offspring of interracial coupling — whether the possibility of occupying two identities (or more) is a choice, a luxury or a delusion; and what fears, doubts or envy nonbiracial black Americans might feel about biracial black Americans. We drop in on Spike Lee’s “School Daze” and the sitcom “Black-ish.” We consider our feelings about Rashida Jones, Drake and Vin Diesel. We unpack the writings of Zadie Smith and Barack Obama.

I eavesdrop as I wait in line at the market, and sometimes, if I think there’s the possibility of nabbing something special, I’ll muster the courage to wriggle into the conversation. I ask shopkeepers how they prepare whatever it is they sell, which is how I came to cook a turkey at a temperature so low I feared it wouldn’t be ready to eat until the next day (its slow-roasted skin was burnished and its meat moist).

It is difficult to look at the word today and imagine the hope and credulity with which it was once invested: These days, people who possess faith in the possibility of the post-racial are usually those who’ve already experienced a measure of its promised ease, as they pass relatively unimpeded through a relatively white world.

The weekend’s family art project, “Raptors in the Autumn Sky,” will invite children to make movable hawk puppets and send them aloft during an outdoor procession. Family strolls will offer opportunities to spy the birds: On Saturday, a guide will lead a garden walk at noon, while on Sunday the educator Gabriel Willow will conduct both a fall birding walk at 9:30 a.m. and a nature walk at noon that will investigate the site’s furry and finned creatures, too. But the signature event is on Monday at 1 p.m., when Brian Bradley, a master falconer with Skyhunters in Flight, will present the weekend’s stars: species like a gyrfalcon (above, with Mr. Bradley), a great horned owl and a Eurasian eagle owl, which will show off their flight patterns by thrillingly swooping over spectators’ heads.

The new generation of Japanese accommodations, though, are neither ryokan nor hotel: They are restored samurai-era mansions, or refit prehistorical huts or even a Baja-esque beach camp.

2017-10-10,"One Model, 41 Beauty Looks","In the past month, the American model Cara Taylor walked 41 runways across the four fashion capitals — each with a different hair-and-makeup look. “This time, there was more of an emphasis on natural beauty,” she noted, instead of the “no-makeup” look that actually requires gobs of products. “At some shows, they put on a tiny bit of foundation, and that’s all.” Backstage, she learned that to keep lips moisturized, “you should use lip conditioner and not Chapstick, because Chapstick is mostly a protector,” she shared, a tip worth keeping in mind year-round.

2017-10-10,The Prophet of Germany’s New Right,"Götz Kubitschek, a self-proclaimed “rightist intellectual,” lives in a medieval manor house in Schnellroda, a rural village in eastern Germany. From this isolated, antique outpost, Kubitschek, who is 47, wields considerable influence over far-right thinkers, activists and politicians across Germany, who make regular pilgrimages to Schnellroda for an audience with him. The manor serves as the headquarters for the magazine and publishing house that Kubitschek runs with his wife, the writer Ellen Kositza, and also for a rightist think tank, the plainly named Institute for State Policy, and a small organic farm where he raises rabbits and goats. Kubitschek calls himself a conservative, battling to preserve Germany’s “ethno-cultural identity,” which he says is threatened by immigration and the alienating effects of modernity. He identifies as part of the German “New Right,” which seeks to dissociate itself from the “old right,” which in Germany means Nazis. German political scientists, by contrast, classify the brand of thinking Kubitschek ascribes to as either an ideological “hinge” between conservatism and right-wing extremism, or as simply extremist — not vastly different, in other words, from the old right. Kubitschek, however, presents his views with a disarming, Teutonic idealism that recalls a Germany that long preceded the rise of Hitler. The German magazine Der Spiegel once referred to him as a “dark knight.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/magazine/the-prophet-of-germanys-new-right.html

2017-10-10,"Are Politicians Responsible for Their ‘Base,’ or Is It the Other Way Around?","Last month, Alabama conducted a novel political experiment, conscripting the state’s Republican voters as its lab rats. The question that was officially on the ballot was whom the party should nominate for the United States Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in February. One option was Luther Strange, a former state attorney general, who had filled the seat since being appointed by a Republican governor who happened to be under investigation by Strange’s own office. The other was Roy Moore, a twice-defrocked State Supreme Court justice described last month by the conservative National Review as “nothing more than a bigoted, theocratic and ignorant buffoon,” who has argued variously that Muslims shouldn’t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, that multiple Midwestern communities are currently governed by Shariah law and that the Sept. 11 attacks might have been divine punishment for America’s sins.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/magazine/are-politicians-responsible-for-their-base-or-is-it-the-other-way-around.html

He certainly looked healthy to the young dermatologist, except for the ugly, nickel-size sore that marred his otherwise smooth, plump cheek. The 5-year-old’s father had taken him in because of three awful-looking sores that appeared out of nowhere. The first one, near the right elbow, erupted a few weeks earlier; the second, on the left calf, a few days after; and the third one, on the face, just after that. His pediatrician had tried a couple of different antibiotic pills and creams, but the lesions just kept getting bigger and uglier.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/magazine/if-the-boy-had-pneumonia-why-did-he-have-odd-sores-on-his-body.html

2017-10-10,Italian in an Intimate Setting Comes to Greenwich Village,"DON ANGIE Some married couples strive for a home of their own. For the chefs Scott Tacinelli and Angie Rito, who have been cooking together since 2008, most recently at Quality Italian in Midtown Manhattan, their dream was to own a restaurant. They married in Florence, Italy, in 2015, and now they have their restaurant, a fairly intimate yet airy 58-seat space, done in white with rich marble accents. Both chefs are Italian-American, he from New Jersey and she from Cleveland. They’re putting a personal spin on some classics, like dressing garganelli with a “broken meatball” sauce, putting escargots instead of clams in a preparation for oreganata, using prime rib to make a braciola for two, and tossing a Caesar salad with chrysanthemum greens instead of romaine. “We’re definitely on the same page when it comes to food,” Ms. Rito said. Her husband added, “It’s not easy cooking together, but I trust Angie’s palate more than my own.” They’re also specializing in “red” amaro aperitifs, and the house wine, Don Angie Cali Chianti, is a Sangiovese from California and comes in a bottle wrapped in old-fashioned straw: 103 Greenwich Avenue (12th Street), 212-889-8884, donangienyc.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/dining/don-angie-nyc-restaurant-openings.html

To visit friends living in rooms on the adjacent staircase — accessible only at ground level — Pullman, a tall, sturdy man with a head like a boulder, would clamber out his window, shimmy along a gutter and propel himself through a window into a bathroom. From where we were standing, the feat looked unlikely, and unwise.

What you unfortunately don’t get to hear very often (unless you work in kitchens) is how sharp and droll and cynical and pragmatic chefs can be too. I’m not saying you can taste it in the food, but every kitchen everywhere has a charming and agreeable dose of jadedness — a vaguely begrudging eye roll expressed most commonly when it comes to menu-planning time in the observation “You could throw your grandmother on the grill with goat cheese and artichokes and sell a thousand plates a night.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/cooking-duck-not-with-love-but-with-pleasure.html

Earth has been around for only 4.5 billion years. About 2.7 billion years ago, basalt lava flowed underwater near what’s now the state’s border with Canada; the lava hardened, and the creep of geologic time turned it into a bedrock of greenstone and granite. On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earth’s crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it. Rails were laid for iron-ore transport, and the town of Ely was founded a few years later, in 1888.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html

From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html

Shot over the course of one year in 23 countries, the movie tracks the here and there of people whose relentless ebbing and flowing make startlingly visible what news headlines repeatedly suggest: that ours is an age of ceaseless churn with no calm in sight.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/human-flow-review-ai-weiwei.html

Eleanor Henderson’s “The Twelve-Mile Straight” and Josephine Rowe’s “A Loving, Faithful Animal” wrestle with the enduring trauma of violence over generations, and Alice McDermott’s “The Ninth Hour” draws narrative power from that perennial burden of Catholicism, shame. Two finalists for the National Book Awards appear on this week’s list: Frank Bidart’s collected poems, “Half-Light,” and Carmen Maria Machado’s debut collection of stories, “Her Body and Other Parties.” You have until the awards are announced on Nov. 15 to finish them.

2017-10-13,Film Series in NYC This Week,"‘COMIN’ AT YA!: 3-D 35MM’ at the Quad Cinema (Oct. 13-19). Today’s 3-D movies use digital projection, but that stereoscopic effect was originally achieved by having two overlapping images projected from strips of film. The revival of 3-D cheese-fests in the 1980s afforded a rite of passage to some rising stars of the decade, including Molly Ringwald in “Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone 3-D” (Oct. 13), Dennis Quaid in “Jaws 3-D” (Oct. 15 and Oct. 17) and Demi Moore in “Parasite 3-D” (Oct. 18). But the attraction of a retrospective like the Quad’s is a chance to see rare formats in action. Arch Oboler’s “The Bubble” (Oct. 14), from 1966, was recently restored for digital projection, but the Quad will present it in its original 35-millimeter “Space-Vision.” Instead of two projectors running simultaneously — one for each eye — as was the practice in the 1950s, Space-Vision achieved the 3-D effect using one projector and one film strip with two images in every frame. This will be the first known screening of the original roadshow version since Mr. Oboler cut the film by more than 20 minutes in 1968, says Robert Furmanek, founder and chief executive of the 3-D Film Archive. 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/film-series-in-nyc-this-week.html

Last week, a series of news articles reported that Harvey Weinstein, one of the most powerful movie producers in Hollywood, has been accused of sexually harrassing women for decades. Twitter is ablaze with other women and men sharing their own stories of sexual misconduct at the hands of the powerful, spawning conversations about power and fame, privilege and punishment. The aftermath has raised questions about the commonality of harassment — and has forced us to confront our own complacency. We were compelled to talk about the cultural petri dish that allows assault and abuse to perpetuate and about what might be changing, socially and technologically, that is encouraging survivors to come forward. We also discuss the recently released “Blade Runner 2049” which somehow felt lacking, as if science fiction can’t keep up with the reality of the moment we’re living through. And before we sign off for a few months, we relive some of our favorite moments from this season. Thank you for listening, and we’ll talk to you soon!",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/podcasts/still-processing-harvey-weinstein-and-our-unreal-reality.html

Commonly pawned items include jewelry, electronics, musical instruments and firearms, but the possibilities are wide-ranging: Tansky has accepted a pocketknife and knows a broker who was approached about pawning a Learjet. Be aware of state-specific prohibitions; in Delaware, for example, it is illegal to pawn artificial limbs and wheelchairs. “I don’t want anybody’s stuff,” Tansky says.

He even attended the Women’s March at Sundance. Yet privately, he appears to have been a sexist ogre, using his power to exploit and humiliate women.

Almost under her breath, she added, “He was a reformer.” Any hope for the liberalization of Russia seemed to die with the czar who had freed the serfs and attempted to modernize the country. Alexander II’s death brought to power his hard-line successor Alexander III, who initiated a harsh crackdown (among those soon executed was the older brother of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin). This would only sharpen the conflict in the country. Peasants had no bread. Workers’ lives were miserable and often endangered. And soldiers were forced into battle in the Great War, a fight they could not win. Alexander III’s son and successor, the hapless Nicholas II, would abdicate in 1917.

Which was just a couple hours before Tillerson would hold an extraordinary news conference in the State Department’s Treaty Room — the magisterial, blue-walled chamber where secretaries of state typically greet foreign dignitaries — in order to tell reporters that Trump “is smart”; deny that he ever considered resigning; and refuse to answer a question about whether he had indeed called the president a moron.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/rex-tillerson-and-the-unraveling-of-the-state-department.html

For about three years, I worked on an audio project about life inside the prison, and the local public radio station found out and offered to train us.

Domino, who died in Louisiana at 89, both embodied and extended the New Orleans piano heritage of styles that are at once unswervingly propulsive and floridly improvisational; he also infused early rock ’n’ roll with New Orleans syncopations. His songs, most written with his producer and bandleader Dave Bartholomew, were often concise sketches of romantic strife involving heartbreak, betrayal, loneliness and spite.

Or that fancy dinner I gave where a bunch of crashers showed up, smoked weed out of corncob pipes and then left, taking an entire homemade pie with them. I shouldn’t even mention my brief mania for giving “theme” dinners in which the theme was known only to me: the Prematurely Bald Men Party; the Dinner at Which Everyone’s Boyfriend Is Named Dave; the All-Strangers Spaghetti Gala. Perhaps the most memorable of all, though, was a dinner party I had when I was 18, mostly because it was the first I ever executed completely on my own.

Even though the questions are part of a centuries-old ritual, “Novitiate,” written and directed by Maggie Betts, takes their content seriously and understands that they are not synonymous. What Sister Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) and her fellow novices aspire to become does not always align with what they want in their hearts. Though they feel themselves called to a life of sacrifice, seclusion and austerity, that vocation often expresses itself with a passion that can be unsettling. It is not just about loving God, but about being in love with him. Eros and Agape, the worldly and spiritual manifestations of love, are not always easily separated.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/novitiate-review-melissa-leo.html

It is a book that hides, and glints, like “the girl” who is at the center of its stark, fable-like tableau of catastrophe, pursuit and repetition-compulsion. The tale might seem simple: a desperate love triangle played out in a world jarred into ecocatastrophe by political and scientific crimes. The narrator, whose resolute search for the girl might appear at first benign or even heroic, nonetheless slowly converges with the personality and motives of the sadistic, controlling “warden,” who is the book’s antagonist and the narrator’s double.

Each year these zoos host weekend celebrations that educate about animals as well as entertain young humans. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Bronx Zoo offers a Haunted Forest, with both wildlife models and scary apparitions, and the Extinct Species Graveyard, a fake cemetery devoted to a real threat: vanishing creatures. Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, and a costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater, above. The Queens Zoo’s festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife — meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example — and a haunted trail for people. The Prospect Park Zoo, whose “Boo” runs 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a Spooky Barn, is focusing on bats, whose activities are more helpful than horrifying. And who could resist a dance party alongside sea lions, which are pretty inventive movers themselves?

2017-10-31,A Shortlist of What We Like Right Now,"Born in Nebraska and raised on a ranch east of Reno, Nev., John Mason arrived in Los Angeles in 1949 curious about ceramics, a discipline that was then largely dismissed as a craft rather than a fine art. But Mason wasn’t deterred: He trained at the Otis and Chouinard art institutes under master ceramists Susan Peterson and Peter Voulkos, and was among the first artists to show at L.A.’s now-iconic Ferus Gallery, known for championing art that bridged the gap between high and low. (Warhol’s soup cans debuted there in 1962, as did John Altoon’s lyrical, quasi-Abstract Expressionist “Ocean Park” paintings.) In the decades since, the now-90-year-old Mason has become renowned for his simple geometric forms (spears, crosses and torqued pillars), which he fires in a room-size kiln in his downtown L.A. studio. An upcoming solo show at Albertz Benda gallery in N.Y.C. will highlight some of his towering columnar works, along with more intimately proportioned, pedestal-friendly sculptures, most of them never previously seen. Some unfold vertically like the gills of an accordion, swiveling effortlessly up from their bases; others stand stoically, their smooth surfaces defined by crisp edges. Glazed in rich, earthy hues like turquoise and burnt umber, they are arresting reminders of an artist who superseded the technical limits of clay — as well as the superficial opposition of art and craft, paving the way for later artists such as Sterling Ruby and Brie Ruais. — LIZ HIRSCH",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/t-magazine/travel-totes-john-mason-show-editors-picks.html

That effort is what has taken the chef, Mark Ladner, many more months than he anticipated to engineer his concept. Now, with skills honed in the serious precincts of Del Posto, after time in some of the earthier Batali-Bastianich properties like Otto, he’s ready. Enter the restaurant up some stairs, and you go straight to the counter where the action is. “It’s a completely new design, and it’s much better,” he said. Last spring, poised to open, he and his business partner, Nastassia Lopez, decided their kitchen plan wasn’t working, so they had the whole thing rebuilt to make the pasta assembly line more efficient, always with an eye on the stopwatch. Mr. Ladner’s combination of speed and quality at a low price involves a freezing method. He offers three types of pastas with a basic marinara sauce for $6 to $7; adding pesto or meat costs another dollar, and 50 cents gets you a topping like cheese. Beverages include wine.
