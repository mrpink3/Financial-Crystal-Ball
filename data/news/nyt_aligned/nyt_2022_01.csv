The seal pups at Año Nuevo State Park. This was not just our relationship to California; this was everyone here. The implicit bargain was that California would protect and deliver to her residents the earth’s own splendor. In return, we’d spend a stupid amount of money on housing and tolerate a few hazards. We stowed an earthquake kit in the basement of our tiny house and, even prepandemic, cached boxes of N95 masks under the sink. Why live anywhere else?

The no- and low-cafs are decaffeinated using the commonplace Swiss Water Process, and the extra caf is made by adding caffeine extracted from unroasted beans.

Then, in 1901, a 33-foot-high steel water tank painted silver, hence its nickname, was erected about a mile outside of town.

Yes, there is the ease of one-click ordering your next read along with your paper towels; yes, if you present purchasing buttons in alphabetical order, Amazon will land at the top of the list. But if you are an author, like Towles, who claims to appreciate local bookshops for “hand selling” your work, why not direct your readers straight to Indiebound, which helps keep the light on in those stores? John Grisham, Mitch Albom, Nicholas Sparks and Diana Gabaldon, I’m looking at you.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/books/review/the-lincoln-highway-amor-towles.html

2022-01-06,Poem: Untitled,"We lost the great Etel Adnan in 2021. I happened to see her exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum in New York on the same day that she died. Adnan’s poems seem to work like her paintings — images pile on top of one another, making new shapes that are more tonal than definitional. At the end of this poem, there’s a choice made when, unspecifically, “the hearts” have “given into violence.” What I love about Adnan’s poems are the ways in which they avoid easy understanding or conclusion. With the addition of “of the wind” at the end of the last line, she layers on complexity, and we are thrust into the magical unknown.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/magazine/poem-untitled.html

The tidy eight-ounce square, encased in an edible orange-hued rind, has collected awards over the years, and in the 2021 World Cheese Awards, Prufrock was one of six cheeses from five countries to win gold in the general washed-rind category. It also won recognition at the first New York International Cheese competition, held last summer. The cheese, made from organic milk, has alluring washed rind funkiness, with a scent of dried wildflowers and a yeasty, briny tang on the palate. Eric and Molly Glasgow, the farm’s owners, decided to go poetic with the name instead of giving it a local tie-in. They’ve continued in that vein with most of their other cheeses, including Banneker, their newest, a Cheddar they started making during the pandemic and only sell locally. It’s named for Benjamin Banneker, an 18th century African American mathematician and astronomer and the subject of a poem by Rita Dove.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/dining/grey-barn-prufrock-cheese-marthas-vineyard.html

To this portfolio it has just added a bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup. The organic syrup, from the Catskills, is given 100 days in the charred white oak barrels used to age its whiskies. The deep amber syrup is thick and scented of earth and smoke, elements that carry into its rich flavor. Alex Clark — who founded the distillery with his wife, Amy Grindeland — is making it as a way to further the life of the bourbon barrels, since according to federal standards, the whiskey must be aged in new barrels.

Le Moné, a new Meyer lemon drink made in Hammondsport, N.Y., has enough bright, citric flavor to cancel winter. It is called an aperitif wine because its base alcohol is wine, from the Finger Lakes region in western New York. Eric Bachli, a former brewmaster at Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn, collaborated with Max Nevins, also of Sixpoint Brewery, and Marissa Reiser, a sommelier, to create the aperitif. California brandy adds a kick to the 32 proof drink. Restrained sweetening is provided by organic blue agave syrup from Mexico, and Meyer lemons, mostly from a distillate using the peels, create the lightly bitter citric profile. It’s mellow yet refreshing on the rocks or in a spritz; it finds its calling added to dry gin, martini-style with a twist.

This most recent venture began with a mission to find a fabric that would give garments not only a comfortable fit but also an opaque finish, a process that eventually led to a signature knit that she now uses for all of the line’s pieces, from seamless ribbed sports bras to elegant long-sleeve leotards. The textile, created from a blend of strong but elastic fibers, is both quick-drying and chlorine-resistant, making it uniquely versatile. “Everything is designed to be used as swimwear, sportswear, underwear or shapewear,” Laub says. “The fabric allows for powerful fits that provide support without a traditional under-wiring structure.” Sustainability is also at the forefront of her vision: Each collection is made in Italy using 3-D knitting techniques that create less waste. Furthermore, clothes that serve multiple purposes, says Laub, encourage shoppers to “buy better and buy less.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/t-magazine/workout-clothes-fashion.html

(Naturally, she becomes a prime suspect.)

Sumptuously done in scarlet and swathed in corduroy, it has a small bar and lounge at the entrance. Then, behind a lush curtain is the main dining room with another bar, seating for 70 and a piano. The chef is Nicole Gajadhar from Saxon & Parole and the chef John Fraser’s restaurants. Her menu is luxurious, featuring oysters, caviar service, tuna tartare, foie gras, potato with caviar, gnudi with truffles, a club sandwich and a burger.

McShea started out in photography while Mosa trained as a goldsmith, but the two, now partners in work and in life, have long been preoccupied with the interaction between fabric and the elements. In 2018, inspired by the Baroque frescoes at the 13th-century Palazzo Monti, in Brescia, Italy, where they were artists-in-residence, they developed a series of ephemeral sculptures by wrapping stone staircases in ribbons and photographing fabric in water. As an afterthought, they also created a flag made of ribbons fixed to a cardboard tube with masking tape. Though it was simple, they felt it had power and, sure enough, things took off two summers later, when the duo began sewing colorful hand-dyed silks, deadstock ribbons and tulle to lengths of ribbon that, doubled over, acted as halyards — or, as they refer to them, hoist ribbons — and tying those with simple bows to scavenged bamboo poles, which they planted on the beaches of Fire Island Pines.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/t-magazine/loewe-fall-mens-flags.html

Close observers of the New York scene will also know the Chilean-born chef, 42, from her pop-ups at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, the Mayflower Inn in Washington, Conn., and Fulgurances Laundromat in Brooklyn. She describes her new restaurant, named for her great-aunt, as “airy, bright and very feminine” with white walls, banquettes upholstered in cobalt blue and brass fixtures. It’s not easy to nail down her food, which will reflect her native Chile, known for its seafood, as well as her experiences cooking in New York, Spain and Australia. “People might have no idea what to expect from Chilean food, but there will be elements of it,” she said. Cholgas secas, a Chilean dried mussel dish that she prepared during her stay at Blue Hill, are on the menu. Seaweeds, which are popular in Chile, garnish several preparations, including oysters with seaweed gremolata. She is also producing dishes like Japanese sardines with mayonnaise potato and peppers, mussels with onion glaze, squab with buckwheat honey and fermented radicchio, monkfish with wakame and black quinoa, and a winter Pavlova dessert with angel hair squash, citron confit and citrus curd.

2022-01-26,"To Hell and Back, Then to CNN","Michael Fanone seemed very out of place. It was the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection, and CNN was commemorating the occasion with blanket coverage. A year earlier, Fanone was a 40-year-old Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.) officer trying to hold off an angry mob outside the United States Capitol. The rioters pulled him from a tunnel and down a set of steps, pummeled him with their fists and their feet and even the staff of an American flag and tased him numerous times; in the melee, he suffered both a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury. Now Fanone was outside the Capitol again, on the set of CNN’s “New Day” morning show, sitting next to its hosts, John Berman and Brianna Keilar. He wore faded jeans and a red-and-black plaid parka, in stark contrast to Berman’s and Keilar’s news-anchor attire. With his heavy beard and a turtleneck of tattoos peeking out from underneath his collar, he looked like some sort of punk lumberjack. He sounded like one too. When Keilar asked him to share some of the conversations he was having with police officers as the anniversary approached, Fanone acidly noted that the U.S. Capitol Police “have to walk the same halls as some of these insurrectionist members of Congress,” before adding, “I couldn’t imagine sharing a work space with those jackasses.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/magazine/michael-fanone-cnn.html

It’s a significant downgrade from the cliché-ridden but visually bracing first installment, transporting Luisito from the streets of his home country (much of the first film was shot in slum areas and working-class neighborhoods in and around Santiago and Baitoa) to a sterile New England town.

There are a couple of routine gags involving stuff like double-sided dildos and ill-fitting leather pants, but for the most part the movie treats bondage and discipline as ordinary, fulfilling pastimes for consenting adults. “Whatever you see, don’t laugh,” a dominatrix warns Charlie (Joey Slotnick), before he attends his first kink festival.

It can also be used to ferment grain for whiskey, which is usually made with malted barley. Takamine, an exceptionally smooth koji-fermented whiskey from Shinozaki Brewery & Distillery in Japan, is now available in the United States. It has a slight mushroom aroma and deserves to be sipped neat. You could call its arrival a return: In the 1890s, Jōkichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist who married an American woman, settled in Chicago and started producing koji-fermented whiskey. After the distillery was destroyed by a fire, he turned to medical research in New York and went on to isolate chemical adrenaline. His success allowed him to donate cherry trees to Washington, D.C., and to establish the Nippon Club in New York. He played a diplomatic role after World War I and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. The 8-year-old whiskey is the first product to bear his name.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/dining/takamine-whiskey.html

Worth preparing are caramelized carrots with ras-el-hanout; hard winter spinach soup; soba noodles with coconut, chiles and kale; and Powder River meatballs. “Poet’s Lunch” peanut butter cookies were a big hit, and I was delighted to see that someone beside me simmers jasmine rice in jasmine tea.

2022-02-01,Multilayered Paintings That Pay Tribute to Hip-Hop Dances,"Last year, Troy Lamarr Chew II spent countless hours in the studio. If he weren’t an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least that’s the sense you get after spending time with his “Slanguage” paintings, which are imbued with messages that aren’t immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take “Yay Area” (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the “Yay” of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Down’s 1993 song “Ice Cream Man,” its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though he’s hardly the only rapper to have used the term). Another work of Chew’s, “Ball Street Journal” (2020), includes images of cheese, bread and paper — all terms for money.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/t-magazine/troy-lamarr-chew-hip-hop-paintings.html
