2017-02-01,The Misunderstood Genius of Russell Westbrook,"In Philadelphia, before the first game of the N.B.A. season, Russell Westbrook worked through his warm-up routine. He was loose and laughing but — as always — precise. Westbrook’s internal clock had driven him to be the first player out on the court, a full three hours before tipoff, and he was performing his routine in front of a largely empty arena. He started with chip-ins and free throws, easy stuff to get his body going, and then moved on to his signature shot: the pull-up jumper. Westbrook’s pull-up is one of modern basketball’s most recognizable weapons — if not yet quite on the level of Kareem’s skyhook or Jordan’s turnaround or Dirk’s one-legged fadeaway, then at least at the edge of that territory. The move is a surprise attack. Westbrook is unreasonably fast and aggressive, a flying, screaming whirlwind of ferocious highlight dunks, and he charges the hoop with so much raging menace that defenders have no choice but to scramble backward to try to stop him. That’s when he hits them with the pull-up: He stops instantly and — while the defender’s momentum continues to drag him backward — leaps perfectly straight into the air, like a fighter pilot ejecting from his cockpit to escape an explosion, except that Russell Westbrook is the explosion: He is the explosion and the control all at once. The whole thing seems to defy the laws of motion.

The season premiere in January was pretty over the top — the five, who are white, were turned black by an electrical shock as they were watching “The Wiz,” and a semi-musical exploration of racial stereotyping ensued. The Feb. 8 installment is at least as boundary-pushing. It begins with a falling piano, a shouted gay slur and a windblown scratch-off lottery ticket. The five take their dispute over ownership of the ticket to professional arbiters, and the resulting debate about what does and does not constitute a slur would curl George Carlin’s toes. The episode also gives the props department a chance to make indescribably vulgar alterations to an exercise bicycle, and by its end one of the core five, Mac (Rob McElhenney), may have had a personal breakthrough 12 seasons in the making.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/arts/television/its-always-sunny-just-keeps-getting-bolder.html

Celebrated for short stories of filigree sentences and blood-freezing endings, Munro (1870-1916) is being reincarnated with suitably macabre elegance at the Fourth Street Theater, where Katherine Rundell’s “Life According to Saki” begins previews on Wednesday, Feb. 8. Directed by Jessica Lazar, this production (which took the Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award at last year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe) places the dapper Munro in the trenches during World War I, where he entertains the lads with narratives that twist like a corkscrew. (His fellow Tommies assist in the tale-telling, as do some Bunraku puppets.)

Make sure it’s sturdy and stable. Wear shoes with thin soles or go barefoot. “That gives you a more tactile feel and allows your feet to interact with the rail,” Graves says. Being on a rail is similar to being on a balance beam, but because the former is thinner and usually round, your whole foot cannot be on top of the rail at once. “That makes balance one of the biggest challenges,” Graves says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/magazine/how-to-walk-on-hand-rails.html

Certainly the description fits Edward Monkford, the tightly wound minimalist at the center of “The Girl Before,” a psychological thriller by JP Delaney that debuts at No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list. Monkford rents his showpiece house only to alluring young women (who don’t always survive), and he rivals Marie Kondo in his aversion to clutter: The review in the daily New York Times was headlined, ominously, “He Doesn’t Like It When You Leave Your Shampoo Out.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/books/review/behind-the-best-sellers-girl-before-author-jp-delaney-on-pseudonyms-and-the-limits-of-marie-kondo.html

Then Rhode Island announced its own proposal, covering two years but open to all in-state students no matter their income. At the federal level, with a Republican-controlled Congress, prospects for similar legislation are dim. During her confirmation hearing as education secretary, Betsy DeVos told Mr. Sanders: “There’s nothing in life that’s truly free. Somebody’s going to pay for it.” Still, the senator from Vermont continues to visit campuses and to push for federal legislation that would make tuition at public colleges free for all.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published a paper called “The Economic Consequences of Brexit,” predicting a “major negative shock to the U.K. economy.” Even pro-Brexit economists expected an immediate downturn: Gerard Lyons, former economic adviser to the prominent Brexiter Boris Johnson, said that the trajectory would resemble the “Nike swoosh” — down then up.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/magazine/the-major-blind-spots-in-macroeconomics.html

This month, the museum unveils a major retrospective, “Merce Cunningham: Common Time,” co-presented with the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The pioneering choreographer was known for collaborating with artists (Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman), which helped dance enter major museums, many of which are now outfitting new spaces with black boxes and sprung floors for just such performances. “Ephemeral forms have largely been left out of art history,” the show’s co-curator Philip Bither says. “And it’s important that those stories be told.” In addition to sets and costumes, the exhibit will feature performances and new commissions from such contemporary choreographers as Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener, who met as dancers in the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, as well as Maria Hassabi and Beth Gill. Happily, the Merce moment will extend eastward in April, with the French company CNDC-Angers set to perform a full evening of Cunningham works at the Joyce Theater in New York, and the Paris Opera Ballet staging his Duchamp-inspired classic “Walkaround Time.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/t-magazine/art/merce-cunningham-exhibit-walker-art-center.html

Much of our work is purely for the joy of discovery, but we also seek badly needed cures for illnesses. A cure for Alzheimer’s disease is beginning to look attainable with technology we are pioneering. While investigating genes for early-onset Alzheimer’s, we invented a gene-transfer method that stopped the brain damage and restored cognitive function. Eureka! Sadly, my doctor has just given me a diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer’s. Given that no truly effective treatment is out there yet, can I try dosing myself with our potential cure? Do I have the right, given that I will otherwise die of dementia before a clinical trial could even begin? I plan to do this alone. None of my people will know about it.

So I needed to convert from a religious understanding that left me paralyzed to act on my deepest sense of connection to one that empowered me to do what I felt to be the right thing.

The first issue of the oversized magazine comes packaged in a cardboard box with posters, prints and badges. “We wanted to create something timeless, that people could come back to and rediscover,” Simmonds says. Inside are intimate portfolios from photographers and stylists like Jamie Hawkesworth, Colin Dodgson, Joe McKenna and David Sims — and there’s even a photo essay from the singer Frank Ocean. According to Burns, the brief to contributors was simple: “to do something personal — to do something that truly inspires the artist and to take time over it.” In fact, this is a mantra that Burns and Simmonds took to heart: They pushed the planned release date of the magazine back by a few months. “We could take our time, digest it, revisit it and add to it,” Simmonds says. “The only people we had to answer to were each other. We could do what we felt was right.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/t-magazine/new-magazines-print-mastermind-replica-man-reedition-.html

2017-02-09,The Look of ’70s SoHo — Captured in One Apartment,"Back when SoHo was a frontier, a place promising infinite possibility for limited funds, the neighborhood’s 19th-century cast-iron buildings began to fill up with struggling artists. The lofts, as they would come to be called — entire floors in former factories and warehouses gone to seed — were drafty in winter, noisy in summer and challenged when it came to plumbing, but who cared when you were getting thousands of feet of raw space for as little as $100 a month? By 1970, galleries were opening, and restaurants and bars soon followed. The artists Gordon Matta-Clark and Carol Goodden opened the restaurant Food on the corner of Prince and Wooster in 1971, fueling the neighborhood’s growing mythology of the artist as urban pioneer. Things got fancier in 1977, when Giorgio DeLuca teamed up with Joel Dean and Jack Ceglic to open the first Dean & DeLuca half a block away on Prince Street. A cavernous space, its white walls and industrial shelving were designed by Ceglic, a painter, to honor the building’s factory roots. The shelves, stocked with then-rare American and European foods (fine olive oils, balsamic vinegars, baby vegetables) became proxy larders for, among others, Donald Judd, who had bought an entire building on Spring Street.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/t-magazine/design/ronnie-sassoon-james-crump-soho-new-york-loft.html

The likes of Madonna and the photographer Helmut Newton had primed that pump long ago, turning dominance, submission and toys into an acceptable spectacle. But it apparently took a writer as terrible as E L James, the author of the “Fifty Shades” series, to really hit the commercial sweet spot. The result is a clutch of best sellers, a hit movie (based on the first book, “Fifty Shades of Grey”) and now a sequel, “Fifty Shades Darker,” that’s almost bad enough to recommend.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/movies/review-fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson.html

If the narrative begins in a room with those items, you’re more likely to be haunted by that space.” Material detail is powerful, because ghost stories are often about objects. “People become possessed by possessions,” Robbins says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/magazine/how-to-tell-a-ghost-story.html

They were a higher order of June and Ward from “Leave It to Beaver”: the Cleavers with sex appeal, shared interests, enthusiasm for the other’s pursuits, and at the same time they were helpmates steering the ship.

It was all about being outside,” Sevigny, who has been living in Brooklyn since 2013, says when we meet in Darien on a 27-degree day in December. The house, she remembers, had a big forsythia bush in the front yard. “It was, like, my spot,” she says, as we drive past gracious colonial-style homes with manicured lawns. “I always just chilled there, underneath. It was all very, you know ...” She begins to laugh, a boisterous, asthmatic-sounding, from-the-gut guffaw that signals she’s aware of the triteness, the irony or maybe just the sheer unlikeliness of what she’s about to say: “... idyllic.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/t-magazine/chloe-sevigny-home-connecticut.html

2017-02-13,The Crowler: An Aluminum Answer to the Growler,"The typical method for taking draft beer home from a bar, brewery or store is a reusable 64-ounce glass growler jug. But the growler has flaws, which has led Oskar Blues Brewery in Longmont, Colo., to develop the Crowler, a 32-ounce can into which keg beer is dispensed. The can is sealed, and you’re good to go. Why is the Crowler better than a growler? Ted Kenny, the owner of Top Hops Beer Shop on the Lower East Side, which recently installed a Crowler machine, said it’s lighter to carry, won’t break, can be taken on a boat, is impervious to air and light, and will keep the beer fresh far longer than the 24-hour limit you get with a jug. The cans can be used only once, but they are recyclable: Top Hops Beer Shop, 94 Orchard Street (Delancey Street), 212-254-4677, tophops.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/dining/beer-crowler-nyc.html

Orwell didn’t really have much feel for the future, which to his mind was just another version of the present. His imagined London is merely a drabber, more joyless version of the city, still recovering from the Blitz, where he was living in the mid-1940s, just before beginning the novel. The main technological advancement there is the two-way telescreen, essentially an electronic peephole.

The dividing line is predictable: Many jocks and traditionalists argue for a separation of church and state; many young fans say that sports, just like everything else, is politics. But as the sports media critic Bryan Curtis has pointed out in The Ringer, the debate is mostly moot now: Trump’s presidency, with its daily explosions, has made it impossible to cover pro sports, even in the simplest box-score ways, without detouring onto the White House lawn. This comes, in part, from the way basic sports coverage works. Reporters ask questions before and after every game, and when the only thing anyone wants to talk about is Trump, some of those questions will be about the president.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/magazine/should-athletes-stick-to-sports.html

In “Gimme Shelter: Hollywood North,” a series running from Friday, Feb. 24, through March 8, Anthology Film Archives examines one such rendezvous, a Canadian tax-incentive program set up in 1974. The outcomes weren’t always good — the term Canuxploitation was coined to describe the worst of the batch, and the program lasted only through the mid-1980s. But the retrospective includes curios like “The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane,” a thriller starring a young Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen, as well as the indisputable gem “Atlantic City” from 1980. Written by John Guare and directed by Louis Malle, the offbeat story of Lou, an aging numbers runner (Burt Lancaster), and Sally (Susan Sarandon), the striving young waitress he romances, plays out as the resort town bets its future on becoming a gambling paradise. The movie is prescient in the ways that hope turns sour, even as it’s respectful of the memory of better days.

Now the storied Japanese hotel group Hoshino Resorts has joined the wave, opening its doors in a quiet village about 10 minutes’ drive outside of town. The just opened Hoshinoya Bali has 30 thatch-roofed, multi-floor villas, all of which flank the three long, interconnected pools that run through the property like a river; guests are able to step directly from their villas’ living rooms into the water. After a swim, they can go skyward and drink a coconut water mojito in one of the elevated open-air gazebo lounges that seem to float above the treetops. What really distinguishes Hoshinoya, though, isn’t Balinese at all, but its exquisite Japanese-inflected menu (try the sashimi and wagyu beef) — as good as anything you might find in Kyoto, and a lovely, if unexpected, complement to the lush surroundings.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/t-magazine/travel/hoshinoya-bali-japanese-hotel.html

Mendoza says that for him, “the best time to go is at night, when the crabs are usually more active.” Academic settings offer another kind of environment in which to go hunting. “A lot of new species are found in museum collections — samples that have remained unstudied and unsorted and no one knows what to call them until a person comes in to name them.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/magazine/how-to-discover-a-species.html

Now She Reports on Their Crimes.,"Other People’s Money: Before she became a journalist, the New Yorker staff writer Sheelah Kolhatkar worked in the late 1990s and early 2000s as an analyst at a couple of small hedge funds specializing in risk arbitrage — basically, she researched companies that planned to merge, and tried to predict how their stock prices would move. “I fell into hedge funds by accident,” she told me in a recent phone call about her new book, “Black Edge,” a look at the insider trading scandal that brought down the huge fund SAC Capital even as its founder escaped prosecution. (The book makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 12.) Kolhatkar got her start in finance as a temp, answering phones, shortly after she graduated from Stanford with a master’s degree in media studies. “This was early in the evolution of hedge funds,” she said, “and a lot of them were willing to take a chance hiring the kind of people you might not expect. There was a start-up atmosphere, so everyone got to do a bit of everything. And the fund manager just sort of took a liking to me. She told me: ‘Look, your boyfriend is a filmmaker. One of you should make some money. I’m giving you an opportunity to learn the business and make some dough to keep living in New York City.’ So I took a crash course in financial analysis and investing. It was like learning a new language.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/books/review/she-began-her-career-at-hedge-funds-now-she-reports-on-their-crimes.html

The fabric is a little bit bridesmaid-y, the type of thing you might expect of another designer who’s been in the business longer, and dresses a woman just a little bit older. It could also be upholstering a chair in a royal residence. But then Kane, 34, puts a pair of foam-rubber Croc clogs on the model’s feet. They are lined with mink —but the affect is still jarring. “These caused outrage,” he says in his strong Scottish accent, referring to the bejewelled Crocs he showed in his spring/summer 2017 collection, which he has updated for fall. He recalls a few of the unprintable comments left on his Instagram account.

And when classes concluded at 3:40, I did not, like a normal person, go home; I went to the school-newspaper office and edited, and wrote, and wondered if anyone would ever kiss me, and eventually, after darkness had fallen, drifted back across Chambers to board the train uptown.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-subway-napping.html

I am a mental-health professional with substantial experience; some people call me an expert. I recently expanded my private-practice hours. To increase patient numbers, I joined an online referral service (at considerable expense). Here’s where the ethical dilemma comes in: Like most “locator” sites, the service includes “customer” ratings. The site reps instructed me to have current patients complete the ratings. My professional training (I’m a psychotherapist) made it very clear that it is a big no-no to solicit testimonials from patients; doing so can badly interfere with the treatment relationship. Patients are in treatment for their own needs and should not be required to consider the therapist’s other actual or prospective patients. (Psychotherapy isn’t a simple commercial transaction.) So my professional-ethics training tells me to leave any ratings up to any patients who find me through the site, which then asks them to rate me. This would mean virtually no traffic through the site.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/magazine/can-therapists-fake-their-own-online-reviews.html

He’s experienced ups and downs with critical and public reception: The critic Raphael Rubinstein has praised the “messy grandeur and devotional passion” of his paintings; Morley Safer, in a “60 Minutes” segment from 2008, dismissed Schnabel as the “poster-boy for the Me Generation.” And now, after several years of neglect from American galleries and museums, Schnabel is having a bit of a renaissance, with a recent retrospective at the Aspen Art Museum, a solo show opening this week in New York at Pace Gallery and a new film project about Vincent Van Gogh in the works. At 65, Schnabel has effectively transcended the sea of commentary that has surrounded him for the last four decades.

The concert was full of songs about a young woman’s needs and prerogatives, mostly lusty ones, delivered with peppy choruses and without shock value or shame. Ms. Grande often sings about the overwhelming strength of temptation and how much pleasure there is in giving in.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/arts/music/ariana-grande-dangerous-woman-live-review.html

2017-02-24,"George Saunders, Famous for Futuristic Short Stories, Hits No. 1 With a Historical Novel","Mourning in America: Could Joe Biden have been the next Abraham Lincoln? That thought came to mind recently thanks to George Saunders’s debut novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo” (new at No. 1 in hardcover fiction), which centers on Lincoln’s sorrow over the death of his young son. Biden, you may remember, opted not to run for president shortly after his son Beau died of cancer in 2015 — a wrenching and understandable decision, of course, but one cast in retrospective relief by the suggestion in Saunders’s novel that private grief made Lincoln a better public servant. “What moved me about Lincoln’s arc during his presidency,” Saunders told me via email, “was the way that the burdens of the office — the floundering war effort, intense public criticism, the mistakes he made that were costing so many lives, the death of his son — beat him down and made him sorrowful, but also, almost causally, seemed to expand the reach of his empathy, so that, by the end, it included soldiers on both sides and the millions of Americans being enslaved by other Americans. It seemed to me that the empathy was somehow a byproduct of the sorrow — a burning-away of his hopes and dreams that resulted in a kind of naked seeing of things as they really were. For me, the book was about that terrible conundrum: We seem to be born to love, but everything we love comes to an end. What do we do with that? How can we keep going and live positive lives under that shadow? I came to understand Lincoln as someone so beat down by sadness and loss that he developed a sort of crazy wisdom — as if, in sadness, all of the comforting bromides that normally keep us from the harsher truths were denied him. Empathy might even thrive best in this state, where the easy comforts are denied us. Conversely, empathy doesn’t do well in a climate of fear or anxiety, when one forgets the particular and individual and, in a panic, begins theorizing about whole groups of people without knowing many of them.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/books/review/george-saunders-famous-for-futuristic-short-stories-hits-no-1-with-a-historical-novel.html

And because he wanted eyes to pop but didn’t want the appearance of obvious makeup, he used the ol’ water line trick: Carrasquillo edged the inside of the upper eyelid, right along the water line, with a pencil (MAC, in Teddy — a slightly metallic, deep brown tone) before curling lashes and brushing mascara onto the upper tips. “Since it’s not on the skin, you don’t see the line of the pencil,” said Carrasquillo, noting that usually eyeliner is only applied to the lower water line. “You still get this darkness to the eyes, this added attractiveness, but without a cosmetic feel.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/t-magazine/fashion/etro-eye-makeup-beauty-milan-fashion-week.html

Martin book. This was the early 2000s, before social platforms had taken off: LiveJournal was still in its infancy; Tumblr had not yet been created. Friendster and Myspace, the most popular of the networks that did exist, were more about sharing perfectly angled photos than having conversations or bouncing ideas off someone. When, in college, a spirited English teaching assistant (who once canceled class for the week to attend a riot-grrrl punk reunion show in Washington) introduced me to zines and the early feminist publishing movement of the 1990s, I felt as if I had been given a lifeline to the outside world.

2017-02-28,How the Trolls Stole Washington,"Over the course of Donald Trump’s staggering political rise, observers tried to make sense of him by borrowing a metaphor from the internet: Trump, they said, was a troll.

Each was meant as a dig: The troll is the bottom-feeder of internet culture, not a hero. But Trump himself gladly owned the slur. When a Twitter user called him “the most superior troll” on the platform back in 2013, Trump replied, “A great compliment!”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/magazine/how-the-trolls-stole-washington.html
2017-02-28,Department of Justification,"One night in September 2014, when he was chief executive of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon hosted cocktails and dinner at the Washington townhouse where he lived, a mansion near the Supreme Court that he liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. Beneath elaborate chandeliers and flanked by gold drapes and stately oil paintings, Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, sat next to the guest of honor: Nigel Farage, the insurgent British politician, who first met Sessions two years earlier when Bannon introduced them. Farage was building support for his right-wing party by complaining in the British press about “uncontrolled mass immigration.” Sessions, like other attendees, was celebrating the recent collapse in Congress of bipartisan immigration reform, which would have provided a path to citizenship for some undocumented people. At the dinner, Sessions told a writer for Vice, Reid Cherlin, that Bannon’s site was instrumental in defeating the measure. Sessions read Breitbart almost every day, he explained, because it was “putting out cutting-edge information.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/magazine/jeff-sessions-stephen-bannon-justice-department.html

She tapped Nick Licata, the executive chef at Degustation, because, as a regular customer, she admired his work. And she hired James Shields, a Betony alumnus, who is managing the restaurant and taking care of drinks. The restaurant, which has 44 seats and another 10 at the bar in an airy room with tall windows, draws a certain laid-back elegance from natural materials like bare wood and rope. And proximity to the Union Square Greenmarket is a boon, Mr. Licata says, given his vegetable-forward menu. “I’m familiar with the purveyors,” he said. Grilled beets with radicchio, cauliflower with capers and raisins, and brussels sprouts with Cheddar and cashews are listed alongside Icelandic char with dill and sorrel, and beef with polenta, horseradish and mustard greens. Even the desserts emphasize vegetables, with one featuring parsnips. He ultimately wants 19 dishes on his menu, as the restaurant’s name, Villanelle, refers to a 16th-century Neapolitan style of melodic poetry consisting of 19 lines.
