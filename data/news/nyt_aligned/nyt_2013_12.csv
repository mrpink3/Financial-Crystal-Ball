2013-12-02,"The High Times, and the Hard Ones, of a Gritty Musical Outlaw","Johnny Cash’s life was a country song full of love and loss, passion and heartbreak — grief, loneliness, guilt, faith, melodrama and striving for redemption. His rough childhood and youth, and turbulent struggles with addiction and family tumult, gave him empathy for sinners in search of salvation and all those who had done hard time or known hard times. His plain-spoken writing and gritty, soul-deep singing transcended musical genres and gave voice to ordinary Americans’ experience of adversity. He was that rare outlaw beloved by soldiers and student protesters alike, by rock ’n’ rollers, convicts and devotees of Billy Graham’s crusades.

He was 8 years old. Karen Quigley, 52, of Sewell, N.J., adopted Elwood, a dark-colored, nearly hairless Chinese crested and Chihuahua mix, after a breeder decided that he was too ugly to sell and would euthanize him. His odd appearance, which included heavy eyelids, a protruded tongue that hung out the side of his mouth and a white tuft of hair on his head, was a hit at the Sonoma-Marin County Fair in California, where the ugly dog contest is held. The experience motivated Ms. Quigley to write and self-publish a children’s book that promoted acceptance called “Everybody Loves Elwood.” The dog later developed an online following, being referred to as Yoda or E.T. by his fans. Elwood appeared at more than 200 events to help raise money for animal rescue groups and nonprofit animal organizations.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/arts/rest-in-peace-elwood-worlds-ugliest-dog.html

I beat together an egg and a little flour until smooth, wanting to thicken the mixture just enough so that it wouldn’t run in the pan. I chopped the scallops and added them to the batter, along with a bit of onion, some parsley, salt and chopped fresh chile, shallow-frying all this by the spoonful in abundant oil. Predictably, the little guys — eight in total — took a couple of minutes per side to become gorgeously golden.

The 8X8 house (8 meters by 8 meters, or about 26 feet by 26 feet) is one of two 1945 Prouvé houses Mr. Seguin found in Bezaumont, France. (The other is a historical monument.) Made in a factory and easily assembled and taken apart, they were an elegant, thrifty solution to the postwar housing crisis in France. The 8X8 house is on display at Design Miami in Miami Beach through Sunday, furnished with pieces by Prouvé and Pierre Jeanneret. In Miami, it would make a high-status pool house. “No need to be a billionaire to go for one of these houses,” he said, but the price is $2.5 million.

Loos provoked a furor in 1910 with the severe facade of a men’s tailoring shop and apartment block facing the imperial palace in Vienna. It became known as “the house without eyebrows” for its lack of decoration, and Emperor Franz Josef was said to have drawn his carriage curtains when he rode past. By contrast, Le Corbusier acknowledged the Modern movement’s debt to Loos, saying he “scrubbed under our feet; it was a Homeric cleansing — precise, philosophical and logical.” Yehuda E.

As Ephron herself figured out long ago, the idea of Dorothy Parker was far superior to the living version, who was good with a one-liner but not much fun to be around. The real Nora Ephron was the person every­body wanted to hang out with, in part because she was funny and charming but more critically because she made the people she was with feel funny and charming. (I certainly wanted to hang around her, and we were friends for years.) She was never the life of the party in the classic center-of-the-crowd sense. She was the one who listened and then finally tossed in the one fabulous line that brought every­thing together.

A throbbing melodrama set partly during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s (and based on a novel by Margaret Mazzantini, Mr. Castellitto’s wife), “Twice Born” generously allows each member of its talented, cosmopolitan cast an opportunity to howl and scream and tremble and generally overdo it.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/movies/twice-born-stars-penelope-cruz-and-emile-hirsch.html

For this fifth anniversary collection, which hits stores in May 2014, the newly engaged designer is looking back to move forward. “In the past couple of years we were really developing the brand around this kind of woman,” says Altuzarra about his imaginary muse, who balances French sensuality with effortless American style. “I think it is a powerful thing to look at a show and have it superdesirable and have it superwearable.” To achieve that balance this time around, his nearly 80 designs are fraught with layers of contrast. Body-hugging sheath dresses are understatedly sexy thanks to preppy madras fabric. Innocent, collegiate-striped skirts have dangerously high slits, an Altuzarra signature. The resurfacing of his other popular standbys — cropped peacoats, oxford shirt dresses, simple knits and soft, draped cocktail dresses — round out the collection so that it essentially becomes a complete wardrobe for the Altuzarra woman. Here, a look at just who that is, along with a behind-the-scenes look at how it all come together.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/the-making-of-a-wardrobe-fitting-for-joseph-altuzarras-fictional-leading-lady/

(Sundance) VANILLA SKY (2001) David Aames (Tom Cruise), a 33-year-old master of the universe, finds his life upended after a car crash in Cameron Crowe’s erotic science-fiction adaptation of “Abre los Ojos,” Alejandro Amenábar’s Spanish romantic thriller. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, the latest plaything in David’s endless succession of beautiful women. Penélope Cruz (above, with Mr. Cruise), who starred in Mr. Amenábar’s original, is Sofia Serrano, whom Julie discovers David flirting with at the birthday party he neglected to invite her to. And suddenly the simple offer of a ride the next morning becomes a suicide leap as Julie drives her car off a bridge, leaving her dead and David condemned to wearing a latex mask. “With its roller-coaster plot and surreal special effects, ‘Vanilla Sky’ is not the kind of film one associates with Mr. Crowe,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The most warmhearted of mainstream Hollywood directors, Mr. Crowe has in the past extended to his characters the affection of an unusually careful and sympathetic listener.” In this film, “that ear is not as sharp,” he continued. “Still, the movie carries a lingering tug of sweetness, most apparent in the film’s heady soundtrack,” which “evokes the dream of eternal youth that infuses ‘Vanilla Sky.’ ”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

One television ad showed Arnold Schwarzenegger bursting from a flagon like a juiced-up genie.

This principle could be applied to writing about all the arts, or most of them — including jazz, as the cultural critic and novelist Stanley Crouch has demonstrated with his judicious, strategically crafted new book about Charlie Parker, the revered and immeasurably influential alto saxophonist and composer. “Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker” is, like the music made by its subject in his abbreviated life, free-flowing and severe, volatile, expansive, allusive and indulgent.

2013-12-06,The Somme,"The Battle of the Somme was immortalized even before the fighting had ceased. The intensive British and French assault along the chalk ridges of the Somme River Valley began on July 1, 1916; scarcely two months later, a silent film — shot within and behind the British trenches — screened in London cinemas. The Somme, like so many other battles of the Great War, was also commemorated in real time by such trench-line poets as Alan Seeger, who composed what became, in short order, their own epitaphs (“I have a rendezvous with Death”) as German shells shook the wet earth beneath them.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/joe-saccos-great-war.html

He did this constantly, usually at home after work. In England, though, he performed the rite in the hotel pub. My mother was furious. For good reason.

In the garden, we play out fantasies, desires and longings, and the ensuing tussle with nature — sometimes gentle, sometimes violent — is for a beauty we can make.

What else could have prompted so many decorators to publish their portfolios, visual memoirs that attest to lives rich with clients? Decorating is one of the most evanescent of the visual arts. It’s painful to walk into a room in which every inch has been lavished with attention, imagination and money, only to learn that the wrecking ball is about to arrive, commissioned by the next decorator.

And yet major surprises continue to arrive, dispatches from the past. Consider, for example, the work of the Chilean photographer Sergio Larrain (1931-2012), whose career was both extraordinary and unusually abbreviated. It was only after studying forestry at Berkeley that he began seriously taking pictures in the mid-1950s, and then an encounter with the Bolivian mystic Oscar Ichazo in 1968 caused him to retreat for the remainder of his life into meditation and yoga, taking small, quiet photos only occasionally, as complements to his inner quest. But for the decade or so that he was in the world and regularly taking pictures, his work, as amply illustrated in SERGIO LARRAIN (Aperture, $85), edited by Agnès Sire, was a constant source of wonder.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/josef-koudelkas-wall-and-more.html

All those hours once spent weeding and mowing can now be devoted to recalling our triumphs and brooding over our failures. There’s also, finally, enough leisure time to study other people’s gardens and pick up a few pointers. And yet, infuriatingly, many of those gardens are also in sleep mode. What to do? The answer to that question — as to so many others — can be found in a book. Five of them, to be precise.

These two books will first open your eyes to the staggering beauty of the place. Then they will chill you. At the bottom of the world, strange and terrifying things are happening miles above and beneath the icy surface, some of them understood, some not; many man-made, some irreversible and all determining the future of this last clean place on earth, and of earth itself.

Gazing at the image even in silence, anyone who loves movies can conjure the voice-over narration of the dead man, talking to the audience directly, describing to us how he, “just a movie writer with a couple of B pictures to his name,” has wound up at the decaying mansion of a faded movie star with two shots in his back and one in his stomach.

As fashion designers have inflated to dirigible proportions — stamping their initials on baby bootees, plotting I.P.O.’s and presiding like some kind of self-appointed Warren court over the quivery aspirants of “Project Runway” — their kinfolk in the movie business have receded ever more into the shadows. They emerge only around Oscar time, even then making little impression on the culture at large. Almost two decades have passed since Lizzy Gardiner, one-half of the Australian team that outfitted “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,” accepted her statuette, jangling gently in a dress she’d made from 254 American Express gold cards. “I’m broke,” she explained, “and I didn’t have anything to wear.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/hollywood-costume-edited-by-deborah-nadoolman-landis.html

So he built a special M.R.I. machine, and trained dogs to lie still inside it, allowing him to study their brains. Though the results may seem obvious to dog lovers (that humans and dogs experience emotions similarly), they’re not a given for science.

She was the daughter of the larger-than-life director John Huston (“The Treasure of Sierra Madre,” “The Maltese Falcon,” “The African Queen”), a man of great appetites and macho endeavor with whom “not only women but men of all ages fell in love . . . with that strange loyalty and forbearance men reserve for each other,” his daughter writes. Huston’s mother, Ricki Soma, a ballerina and the daughter of an Italian-restaurant owner in New York, was John Huston’s fourth wife. They eloped when she was 18 and he was in his mid-40s. Huston was their second child and — with her mother now transformed into the beautiful couture-clad “translucent and remote” mistress of a vast West Ireland estate — she was raised amid multiple servants, visiting film-world eminences and colorful locals in the kind of world that has disappeared, other than, say, in movies starring Keira Knightley.

As for illustrated books, there wasn’t much between the affordable volumes of John Boardman’s Thames & Hudson paperback series, with their masterly text and plentiful but small and hard-to-see photographs in black and white, and expensive volumes with magnificent photos, mostly relegated to academic libraries. That’s all changed, largely because of the Internet, where high-resolution photographs of individual vases — on academic and curatorial websites with expert analysis, certainly, but also on the Flickr accounts of museumgoing tourists — let you zoom in on the tiny details in which much of the delight of Greek vase painting lies. But the lower cost of printing has also put beautifully printed large-format books within reach, and for readers getting interested in Greek vases for the first time, a coherent illustrated overview of the subject is invaluable and much more manageable on the page than on-screen.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/john-h-oakleys-greek-vase.html

The first such doll crossed the Channel — ready for the latest take on wimples, ladies? — in the 14th century.

The set had been carefully constructed on a studio back lot, but even fake swamps have real water. This required Jim Henson, Kermit’s creator and performer, to execute the complicated sequence submerged. As Kermit crooned, Henson lurked beneath the surface of the ersatz bayou, his lanky frame folded into a ­custom-made diving bell, his oxygen pumped in through a tube.

2013-12-06,The Chelsea,"“It’s a sad irony of New York life that over time, the fabled buildings and institutions that first attract us to the city fade into invisibility.” So begins Sherill Tippins’s thorough, if not groundbreaking, Hotel Chelsea history. For the past dozen or so years, the Chelsea has been raging against invisibility. Former guests and residents as different as Dee Dee Ramone, Abel Ferrara and Ethan Hawke have featured it in their work. Current residents have waged a very public battle with its recent owners. In anticipation of a potentially soul-killing renovation, two new books capture its lovably scuzzy spirit. One is an evocative coffee-table book by the photographer Victoria Cohen, HOTEL CHELSEA (Pointed Leaf Press, $95), which treats the oddly painted rooms’ quirky mix of old and new furniture, worn carpeting and garish bedspreads as something like sacred relics. The other is Tippins’s doorstop-hefty ­“Inside the Dream Palace,” which aspires to tell the “definitive story.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/inside-the-dream-palace-by-sherill-tippins.html

Some authors choose a single figure and bore down deep, which has brought the count of Paul McCartney life stories to at least 10, with more in the pipeline. Others frame the narrative from more expansive angles, weaving in the era’s social texture, politics and cultural context (see Devin McKinney’s shrewd “Magic Circles” from 2003 or Jonathan Gould’s peerless “Can’t Buy Me Love” of 2007).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/tune-in-the-beatles-all-these-years-volume-1-by-mark-lewisohn.html

Nasty stuff of this sort may resurface after years of psychoanalysis or — less therapeutically if more efficiently — in the course of a compact, elegantly constructed ghost story, which happens to be one of Hill’s specialties. Her nerve-­shaking 1983 novel “The Woman in Black” is a modern classic of the genre, in the whispery manner of M. R. James and Robert Aickman.

Drawn from the most noble families of Europe, they left their homelands, took vows of chastity and obedience and dedicated themselves to fighting infidels.

2013-12-09,The Holiday Issue,"T’s final issue of 2013 is a festive affair. In our cover story, Suzy Menkes celebrates the enigmatic designer Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, who is bringing the “beautiful chaos” of Dover Street Market, her multibrand fashion bazaar, to New York’s Kips Bay neighborhood. Elsewhere, we visit four prominent artists — Jeff Koons, KAWS, Ugo Rondidone and Chuck Close — to find out what sorts of work they themselves collect, and what their collections say about them. At the Park Avenue apartment of Renee and Mark Rockefeller, we find that the color beige doesn’t have to be tepid and uninspired; deployed with a discerning eye, it can be smart and seductive. We capture the zany wit of Kristen Wiig, who appears in the forthcoming film “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” by asking her to fill in the blanks in a Mad Lib that (sort of) describes her career trajectory to date. We visit the Moroccan city of Tangier, which, as home to expats like Pierre Bergé, Bernard-Henry Lévy and Roger Vivier, remains one of the world’s great melting pots for creative types. We meditate on the magic touch of the hotelier André Balazs. We pay tribute to the enduring glamour of well-preserved old restaurants, from Paris’s La Grenouille to New York City’s “21” Club, that feel trapped in amber. And finally, in the spirit of the season, we offer the very best gifts you can give, from food to fragrances to jewelry to adventures of a lifetime.

2013-12-09,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) STOKER (2013) In his English-language debut, the South Korean director Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “Lady Vengeance”) tells the story of India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), a solitary Connecticut teenager embroiled in a landscape of family secrets, sexual subtext and aristocratic entitlement after her father (Dermot Mulroney) dies in a car accident on her 18th birthday. Then her handsome Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew, comes to visit her mother (Nicole Kidman, above left, with Ms. Wasikowska), who seems insufficiently grief-stricken to her daughter. That’s when the family’s housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) disappears, and a worried relative (Jacki Weaver) alludes to further danger ahead. “A great deal of information has been withheld, perhaps from India and certainly from us, and Mr. Park, with sadistic relish, takes his time with revelations that are both ghastly and a bit disappointing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The exquisite sense of mystery that has built up around India begins to dissipate as the focus shifts to Charlie, and tantalizing ambiguities are resolved into a tale of madness and murder.” Which, he added, “is not so bad, though the final act of ‘Stoker’ walks a fine line between the sensational and the silly.” Learning the truth about Charlie, Mr. Scott said, “does not so much explain what had come before as turn everything upside down, scattering the puzzle pieces in a colorful, brutal cascade.” The actor Wentworth Miller (“Prison Break”) wrote the screenplay.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-12-09,What’s On Sunday,"9 P.M. (A&E, History, Lifetime) BONNIE & CLYDE Bruce Beresford puts his spin on the doomed love affair of the 1930s gangsters Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in this two-night mini-series starring Holliday Grainger and Emile Hirsch. William Hurt portrays Frank Hamer, the retired Texas Ranger who led the team that killed Parker and Barrow in 1934. Holly Hunter (above left, with Ms. Grainger) plays Parker’s mother. “Mr. Beresford (‘Tender Mercies,’ ‘Driving Miss Daisy’) gives the sentimental material a corresponding autumnal glow, and there are sweeping, lovely images of Texas fields under big skies, a shimmering crescent moon and an oil refinery sparkling in the night,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Comparing Mr. Beresford’s work to Arthur Penn’s 1967 film with Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, Mr. Hale adds: “In the end, ‘Bonnie & Clyde’ has the one thing in common with ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ that you’d expect: the fusillade of machine-gun fire, and Barrow and Parker’s bodies twitching and bursting as they’re torn apart. While it doesn’t have the force of Penn’s brutal choreography, it’s a surprisingly graphic scene for basic cable. Less surprising is a gratuitous, last-minute plot twist that serves to cement the film’s portrayal of Barrow as a tragic, star-crossed hero. Apparently, only the misunderstood die young.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/arts/whats-on-sunday.html

2013-12-09,After Hours | An NC-17 Retelling of ‘The Nutcracker’,"The jewel-box-small, down-at-the-heels Minetta Lane Theater is the perfect setting for this opulently burlesque and deliciously Freudian retelling of “The Nutcracker,” which has shades of Cirque du Soleil, “Sleep No More” and “Fanny and Alexander” (with a dash of “Satyricon”). It’s the work of the Brooklyn-based, largely Juilliard-trained dance-and-acrobatics ensemble Company XIV. On a proscenium framed by heavy red curtains, with candelabra where the footlights would usually be, Tchaikovsky’s darling little Clara (a radiant Laura Careless) is a mini-Marie Antoinette with a comeuppance in store, to be delivered by Drosselmeyer, her godfather, played like a smarmy satyr pimp by Jeff Takacs. The genius of this production, which includes eye-dazzling physical feats performed on giant hula hoops and from silken swings, is its transformation of traditional ballet into louche vaudeville: the famous Spanish dance becomes a foot-stomping, castanet-clicking striptease; in the storied Kingdom of the Sweets, Clara wields a fat black whip to play gleeful dominatrix over a troupe of bare-bottomed, harnessed Licorice Boys.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/after-hours-an-nc-17-retelling-of-the-nutcracker/

The show, which has already appeared in Europe and Canada, includes Spiegelman’s early Wacky Pack and Garbage Pail Kids sketches, and closes with more recent projects, like a performance he choreographed and designed with the dance troupe Pilobolus and a colored-glass window representing an art student’s life that he made for his alma mater, the High School of Art & Design in New York. In October, Spiegelman published his monograph, “Co-Mix” (Drawn & Quarterly), and premiered his hybrid slide-show-talk-concert “Wordless!,” which focuses on the woodcut novels of early-20th-century artists like Lynd Ward, at the Sydney Opera House.

2013-12-11,Three’s a Trend | Art That’s All About the Money … Literally,"On paper, art is a lot like money. The value of an art object has almost nothing to do with the time required to make it, and even less to do with its materials; if counterfeit, its worth is nil. So it’s no wonder that some physical artists in a disembodied world are — like Warhol in the plastic age or Rihanna in “Pour It Up” — all about the benjamins. At this year’s Art Basel in Miami Beach, Scott Campbell (OHWOW Gallery) showed sculptures built with greenbacks and Hugh Scott-Douglas (Blum & Poe) manipulated foreign currency in a set of his signature magnified scans. Meanwhile, over at NADA, Robert Wechsler (China Art Objects Galleries) exhibited perfectly symmetrical cubes constructed from spare change. In a time of relentless secondary-market speculation that turns young artists into stocks just waiting to be cashed in, it’s almost as if the artists themselves are turning around and saying: “Happy now?”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/threes-a-trend-art-thats-all-about-the-money-literally/

Gregory Annenberg Weingarten, a vice president of the Los Angeles-based Annenberg Foundation, said it had decided to buy the items, at a cost of $530,000, once it became clear that the Paris auction house EVE would not delay the sale to allow the tribes time to gather proof that the items had been stolen from their lands long ago. “These are not trophies to have on one’s mantel,” he said.

Several galleries created complete residential settings in which they installed their pieces. Demish Danant, for example, felt like a Parisian apartment from the 1970s with its boiserie and wall-to-wall carpeting.

Early in his career, Russell developed a reputation as a brilliant but difficult director; George Clooney said the two actually came to blows on the set of Russell’s third film, “Three Kings,” and later a YouTube video circulated of Lily Tomlin and Russell in a full-throated, expletive-laced shouting match on the set of his fourth film, “I Heart Huckabees.” Whether­ the characterization was fair, Russell has since undergone a personal, artistic and, ultimately, professional transformation. He regards “Hustle,” a highly fictionalized version of the Abscam scandal of the late ’70s and early ’80s, as the third in a loose trilogy of films about ordinary people trying to live passionate lives.

The couple, who were introducing their 7-year-old son, Sebastian, to the park, photographed trees that were rugged and imperfect. Back in New York, they designed what Ms. Levin called “our own forest.” The result is a romantic image of a silhouetted woods at dusk sitting above its hand-drawn mirror image. Flip the piece and it looks like a forest at dawn. Trace is one of three patterns in Trove’s winter collection, which will be formally released next month.

2013-12-12,What’s on Thursday,"9:30 A.M. (Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In Woody Allen’s tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile, in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend visits. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movie’s limitations, “as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights.” Complaining, he added, “would be as superfluous — though also, perhaps, as inevitable — as psychoanalysis.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

Tolkien’s children’s book, Bilbo Baggins has a sword called Sting and One Ring to Rule Them All — eventually. We have a ways to go. As everyone on Earth and in Middle-earth surely knows, Mr. Jackson, having turned Tolkien’s trilogy “The Lord of the Rings” into three hit films, has given its prequel a blockbuster do-over in three separate 3-D movies. The first, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” a soporific 170 minutes released in 2012, lived up to its subtitle principally by moving at a snail’s pace. At 161 minutes the new one by contrast feels like a sprint. (The third, “The Hobbit: There and Back Again,” is set for world domination in December 2014.)

Set entirely inside a Brooklyn brownstone — with a brief trip to the backyard — this gendered gabfest has been constructed along familiar LaButian lines. A man and a woman pace like inmates, jawing and clawing and drawing metaphoric (or not) blood, and then Mr. LaBute, rather like a mean O. Henry, tosses in a detonating surprise that either changes what you’ve thought until that moment or ticks you off. This audience baiting is also very much by design, of course, and can be playful or sadistic or both, or neither.

That was due in great part to the grim sets, which have none of the historical detail of the Franco Zeffirelli production. Only bare brick walls and what appear to be Ikea folding chairs offer respite for a viewer tired of puzzling over that Lucian Freud painting that has somehow found its way into the church, perhaps dumped there by Napoleonic troops after an art looting expedition into the future.

2013-12-13,Now Screening | Putting a Human Face on the African AIDS Epidemic,"The central figure in the director Maggie Betts’s affecting documentary, “The Carrier,” 28-year-old Mutinta Mweemba, is H.I.V.-positive and pregnant. A partner in a polygamous marriage in a small Zambian village, Mweemba is following a Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (P.M.T.C.T.) program, receiving medication to keep the disease from being transmitted to her child. The film tracks Betts’s interactions with her family members (her husband and one of his two other wives are also infected) and her community, creating an unexpectedly intimate, nonjudgmental snapshot of the African AIDS epidemic. It shows how universal a mother’s fear of harming her child is, regardless of social or economic differences. “There’s no way an innocent baby who hasn’t even been born yet could have done anything to deserve this fate,” Betts says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/now-screening-putting-a-human-face-on-the-african-aids-epidemic/

Yet Colombo is fast becoming a draw in itself. This city of 555,000 people has been on fast-forward since a 25-year civil war ended in 2009.

2013-12-16,Ohio: School Officials Plead Not Guilty After Rape," The superintendent and three current or former city school officials in Steubenville, Ohio, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges filed following a grand jury investigation of the August 2012 rape of a 16-year-old girl. The superintendent, Michael McVey, 50, who is free on a personal recognizance bond, has been accused of evidence tampering, obstruction of justice and two other charges. After the hearing, his lawyer said he was confident the charges would prove unfounded, according to The Associated Press. The rape case drew national attention and led to the conviction in March of two Steubenville High School football players. Afterward, the Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, convened a special grand jury to examine whether officials covered up the crime, and the panel returned indictments against six people. But only some of those charges stem from the first rape case, while others relate to separate accusations investigated by the grand jury, including some stemming from allegations of the sexual assault of a 14-year-old student four months earlier, as well as other charges of theft and stolen property.

They said the measures undermined the interim deal reached last month, when Iran was given sanctions relief in exchange for suspending some parts of its nuclear program for six months. “This two-sided game and confusion we are witnessing is not beneficial for the atmosphere of the talks,” Iran’s top negotiator and deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Friday. A spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign policy chief and the coordinator of the negotiations with Iran, said the discussions were expected to resume in the near future.

Bill Nighy plays General Fallon, the leader of the cannibalistic brotherhood in an otherworld called Gantua; Ewan McGregor, above, in Errol Flynn mode, plays a knight who almost becomes finger food; and Stanley Tucci is the shifty fellow to whom the royal lass has been promised. “For its first 90 minutes, ‘Jack the Giant Slayer’ is painlessly diverting,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “The visual design for the giants and the beanstalks keeps your eyes busy, even when the story sets your mind to wandering.” Still, she added, “in the metaphorically rich original tale, a boy wakes to discover he’s produced a mighty stalk.

Since October, five structures have been destroyed by fire. This is not the first time parts of the site have been destroyed. In 1991 and 1999, the city bulldozed large portions of the installation, viewing the collection of random items and hodgepodge paintings not as art, but as trash. Originally created by the artist Tyree Guyton to combat urban blight and decay, the Heidelberg Project has expanded its goals to provide art education and to promote community development. It is also something of a tourist destination, with over 275,000 visitors annually. There are no suspects in the fires.

Polygons form a delicate mesh that envelops the finger, a shape that is reminiscent of Hadid’s Al Wakrah stadium in Qatar. In fact, she acknowledges, “There is a lot of fluidity now between jewelry design, architecture and art — a lot more cross-pollination in the disciplines.” The collection was introduced earlier this month at Colette’s pop-up at Art Basel in Miami Beach and at the Zaha Hadid Design Gallery in London last week.

2013-12-17,What’s On Tuesday,"11:30 A.M. (MoreMax) ANNA KARENINA (2012) Keira Knightley (above) stars as Anna, the bored wife of a virtuous government official (Jude Law) in mid-19th-century Imperial Russia, who travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her philandering brother (Matthew Macfadyen) in Joe Wright’s stagy adaptation of this Tolstoy novel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoy’s alter ego, whose idea of love — an ennobling union of souls — is a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. “I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wright’s real interest, like Tolstoy’s, is in everything that happens in between Anna’s first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wright’s screen versions of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” and Ian McEwan’s “Atonement” “remain trapped in literariness,” he added, “Mr. Wright’s ‘Anna Karenina’ is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.” Jacqueline Durran won an Oscar for costume design.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

In 1987, Jordan Belfort — a.k.a. the wolf himself — took a job at L. F. Rothschild, an old white-shoe firm. It was his first job in the business, and he was given the assignment of cold-calling “prospects” that he would then turn over to a broker. In his memoir — upon which the movie is based — Mr. Belfort claims, among other things, that a successful Rothschild broker (played by Matthew McConaughey on screen) took him to lunch on his first day and told him to masturbate often if he hoped to be a good broker himself. Given Rothschild’s stodgy reputation, I tend to think this story is an exaggeration, an act of salesmanship intended to lure in Hollywood. No matter. Not long after Mr. Belfort began working for L. F. Rothschild, the crash of 1987 wiped out the firm and took his job with it.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/movies/martin-scorseses-approach-in-the-wolf-of-wall-street.html

So it goes at N.Y.U.’s Skirball Center, where “Cirkopolis,” the latest body-twisting delight from the Montreal neo-circus troupe Cirque Eloize, is in residency through Jan. 5. The show begins with a single man, a beaten-down bureaucrat in business drab, stamping papers at a desk before giant projections of rotating industrial cogs, à la “Metropolis.” It sounds like the scene is being set for some Weimar-tinged exploration of the alienation of the human worker. Not quite. Those Bauhaus facades are a mere backdrop for a dazzling display of human bodily levitation, contortion and gyration. The acrobats defy gravity in jaw-dropping performances on giant wheel-like contraptions, atop one another’s bodies, suspended from trapezes and ropes, and, astoundingly, up and down a 100-foot pole at frenetic speeds.

MacMonnies proposed a multitiered fountain topped by the figure of an Indian chief, but local citizens objected to celebrating a recently feared and despised enemy.

2013-12-20,"Other Countries, Other Shores","We love poets for the things their poems lead us to imagine; but equally, we love them for how we imagine their lives to be. Confusing poets’ lives with their work is an illusion as old as the tradition of confusing words with objects. But in fact it is for the sake of this illusion that we feel such a strong need for poetry, for novels, for literature. There are some poets whose work we read with their lives in mind, and what we know of those lives ensures that their poetry leaves a more enduring impression. C. P. Cavafy is, for me, just such a poet. Like Edgar Allan Poe, like Franz Kafka, Cavafy makes no explicit reference to himself in his best and most stirring work; and yet, with every poem we read, we cannot help thinking of him.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/books/review/other-countries-other-shores.html

He enrolled in art school to become an illustrator in the footsteps of Howard Pyle and N. C. Wyeth, just as the Armory Show of 1913 was about to usher in the avant-garde and relegate illustration — art as storytelling — to the back pages. He was a loner, did not feel close to his parents or brother, was not a devoted father to his three sons. He was married to his work; his three wives, Irene O’Connor, Mary Barstow and Molly Punderson, learned to accommodate. His biographer reports that his love life was stark: “Nothing that can be described as a love letter survives among his papers. It seems unlikely that he ever wrote one.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/books/review/american-mirror-the-life-and-art-of-norman-rockwell-by-deborah-solomon.html

Grant as Bob Cratchit, Saskia Reeves as Mrs. Cratchit and Joel Grey as the First Sprit, follows at 9. Writing in The New York Times, Caryn James called the production glorious: “Its greatest triumph is Mr. Stewart’s performance. (He has played all the parts in his one-man stage version.)” She said, “This impenetrable man will not be easily touched, even by ghosts.” This “Christmas Carol” is a lasting addition to a list of towering renditions, she added. “Evoking the pure joy of the Christmas season and its spirit of giving, it reveals why Dickens’s story has such inexhaustible appeal.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2013-12-20,Chicago’s Opportunity Artist,"Six blocks from where I grew up, on Chicago’s South Side, the artist Theaster Gates showed me a neo-Classical ruin, a Prohibition-era bank shuttered for 33 years that I only ever registered vaguely as a part of the area’s enduring blight. “That’s my bank,” he announced with a flourish, pointing proudly to its glazed terra cotta and its ornamental eaves. Maybe it requires an artist to picture the possibilities in such a wreck, or a real estate developer to envision its promise. Gates, 40, is both at the same time, an enormous dreamer canny enough to make his outlandish ideas for the neighborhood a reality. When the bank was days from demolition, Gates spoke with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose brother, Ari, owns several Gates pieces; the city agreed to sell the abandoned building to Gates for $1, with the stipulation that he come up with the $3.7 million necessary for its renovation. A portion of that money, Gates devised, would be made from the bank’s original marble, which he cut into individual “bond certificates” engraved with an image of the building, his signature and the words “In ART We Trust.” He created 100 tablet-size bonds, selling them for $5,000 apiece; larger slabs, as weighty as tombstones, went for $50,000. Because they’re works of art, Gates told me, the marble will actually increase in value, functioning like real bonds. “So, yeah, it’s a bank! The bank should continue to make currency. I want it to have a banking function.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/chicagos-opportunity-artist.html

I think half a century ago, things changed drastically. Before those days, women were at home and they were cooking. With feminism, you had to go to work, and if you had to go work — well, you know, forget the cooking. For many French women a job is not the top priority in life — family is. In the U.S. you’re sort of defined by what you do.

2013-12-20,One! Last! Time!,"On Christmas Day, Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone will open in “Grudge Match,” a movie about a couple of old, rival boxers spoiling for one last fight. This may seem like an unpromising premise, but perhaps the movie will please the same audience that went for the recent comedy “Last Vegas,” which is about three AARP-appropriate Brooklyn guys from the old neighborhood — one married, one divorced and one widowed — who get together for one last ring-a-ding-ding Vegas weekend to toast the impending wedding of their fourth pal, a holdout bachelor who has spontaneously decided to tie the knot. (Gentle life lessons ensue.) The fact that the preternaturally tan and swinging groom to be is played by Michael Douglas (age 69) adds a dribble of amusement to the premise. So does the paycheck-collecting participation of aging movie stars like De Niro (him again), Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/one-last-time.html
2013-12-20,Who Made That Smoke Alarm?,"In the early 1960s, Duane Pearsall tinkered in his engineering lab with a machine he called a “static neutralizer” — an ion generator designed to control static electricity in factories and photo labs. But when one of his technicians lit up a cigarette, a meter measuring the ions went haywire. Pearsall realized he’d just hit on a low-cost, low-power method for sniffing smoke. During the next decade, he and his team developed the SmokeGard, which hung from the ceiling and made a noxious noise whenever it sensed a fire. Soon, smoke detectors were in most homes in America and had saved hundreds of lives. Yet they could also be irritating. “You have no way of knowing whether it’s operational unless you set fire to your house,” wrote one newspaper humorist in 1977 of a cheap smoke detector he bought in a local store. “Merely holding the smoke detector in your lap while you watch Farrah Fawcett-Majors is not a true test.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/who-made-that-smoke-alarm.html

2013-12-20,A Historian in Camelot,"Most intellectuals are attracted to power, but none with less ambivalence than Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the brilliant historian of the New Deal who became the quasi-official chronicler of the Kennedys. Schlesinger was born into an American aristocracy in its prime — the Eastern liberal intelligentsia. He was the son of an eminent Harvard historian and grew up apparently knowing everyone. He met his first Kennedy (sister Rosemary, before her lobotomy) when he was 14, at a Christmas party in 1931. It was natural, maybe even inevitable, that Schlesinger, while serving as an intelligence officer in Germany at the end of the war, would be invited to dinner “at the palatial mansion shared by George Ball and Ken Galbraith.” In Washington after the war, the young author of “The Age of Jackson” had a place at the table of Georgetown dinner parties thrown by the columnist Joseph Alsop, where he met Democratic Party royalty — Averell Harriman (“quite favorably impressed by him”), Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. (“looks astonishingly like his father and has adopted many of his mannerisms”) and John F. Kennedy (“seemed very sincere and not unintelligent, but kind of on the conservative side”).

2013-12-20,Inside the List,"The Limited: Hardcovers, paperbacks, ­e-books — the combined lists include them all. But what about collectible limited editions, wherein a specialty publisher produces a small run of books to an exacting standard, often by hand? (Think of the old leather-bound Franklin Library titles, for example.) The Times doesn’t track those, since by their nature they sell in numbers too small to register. That doesn’t mean they never intersect with the best-seller lists, though. One such publisher is Joe Stefko, the owner of Charnel House books in Catskill, N.Y., who for more than 20 years has printed limited editions of Dean Koontz’s novels. Stefko, 58, a former drummer for Meat Loaf, got interested in fine books when he played with the Turtles. “Other bands had drug dealers coming to their dressing rooms,” he told a music fan site some years ago, “and we had book dealers coming to ours.” As you’d guess from its name — and its address, P.O. Box 666 — Charnel House specializes in horror, and Stefko has designed covers with protruding fangs (for Christopher Moore), real bullets (for Stephen King) and deep fingernail gouges (for Tim Powers). “These are commercial books,” he told me in a phone interview, “but I turn them into fine art.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html

(In 2012, a blizzard ground the city to a halt, and Romans are still talking about it with wide-eyed amazement.) My daughter can’t possibly remember the winters of her New York babyhood, but suddenly, about six months ago, she began to ask me when the snow would come. When would we play in the snow? Where was the snow hiding? I could only guess she was exhibiting a child’s sixth sense for wonder: Snow is a portal out of the ordinary churn of life, forcing even grown-ups to go out and play. Coincidentally, and luckily for my daughter, three new picture books herald the majesty of snow, bringing its almost magically transformative power to any child who yearns for it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/books/review/jonathan-beans-big-snow-and-more.html

Behind him, guarding against the threat of assassination, stood a former cowboy, armed with a Colt .45 and a 20-inch blade hidden inside a walking stick. “Most pass by with awed looks,” a witness wrote, “while some few are proud to be seen sitting alongside and basking in the great man’s halo.” One of those who stopped to stare was the actress Ethel Barrymore, in town with a touring company.

In Greg Baxter’s pellucid first novel, “The Apartment,” it may be simply the length of a day — but a day in which one travels surprisingly far, literally and figuratively. Baxter, whose only previous book is a work of nonfiction, “A Preparation for Death,” which details his implosion and rebirth as a writer and a person, has written a novel of subtle beauty and quiet grace; I found myself hanging on every simple word, as tense about the consequences of a man finding an apartment as if I were reading about a man defusing a bomb. And, possibly, that is what “The Apartment” is as well: the analysis of an explosion deferred, or narrowly avoided, a hairbreadth escape.

Now, thanks to the artist Ugo Rondinone, I dream of wearing it. Rondinone made a splash earlier this year when an installation of his nine colossal stone sculptures, often likened to Stonehenge, inhabited Rockefeller Center. A few months later, in collaboration with the creative couple Sebastien and Stephanie Jannssen, Rondinone created mythical little masks that fit into the palm of your hand. The seven 23-karat-gold sculptures, created in a limited edition of six (plus three artist’s proofs), represent each day of the week and can be worn as a pendant. This enigmatic piece is sure to cure any case of the Mondays by making even the most cynical among us smile. Like most great works, it’s an investment piece. But as any art lover will tell you, it’s impossible to own all the art you want. That’s what dreams are for.

2013-12-26,What’s on Thursday,"10:35 A.M.

But when Liz dumps Shaun, he decides to get his life together to win her back. Of course there’s also the small matter of a zombie apocalypse going on outside his door. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that the film skillfully satirized the zombie genre by “implying that Britain may already be populated with the living dead, metaphorically speaking.” He added, “The motley Londoners who face down the creatures are so inept and unthinking in their response to the catastrophe that the uncharitable part of you may decide that they deserve their probable (but not guaranteed) fates during what panicked television commentators label Z-Day.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/26/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

2013-12-27,What’s On Friday,"1:45 P.M. (IFC) THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD (2007) Andrew Dominik directed this contemplative portrait of the final days of the outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt, above) and his gang (Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and others). One member of the posse is Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who is more obsessed fan than loyal sidekick. And when Jesse James, the man, does not live up to the myth, Ford decides to grab a piece of fame for himself. “Dressed in near-all black, the question mark known as Jesse James stands away from the camera, knee-deep in a golden, grassy field stirred by the wind or perhaps just an off-screen mechanical fan,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “The cinematography may speak to Mr. Dominik’s yearning for meaning and importance more than it does of his outlaw, but the visuals often dazzle and enthrall.” Roger Deakins received an Oscar nomination for best cinematography for his work on the film, and Mr. Affleck was nominated for best supporting actor.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

Burleigh surveys many of the major international wars and anticolonial insurgencies between 1945 and 1965, but opts to focus most on those involving America, Britain and France, and how they related to the rivalry with the Soviet Union. The result is a well-researched and readable account of two tumultuous decades. Burleigh judges most of these wars, both small and large, to have been futile and destructive. But while he clearly has no interest in defending or rehabilitating such conflicts, he nonetheless offers a fair, thoughtful assessment of the motives and interests behind them. He also takes care to understand and explain the grievances of the insurgents.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/books/review/small-wars-faraway-places-by-michael-burleigh.html

Here, he might have been describing his own life: much adventure, a sort of love story, a weird bang of a finish. In a new biography by the London scholar Earle Labor, the “bigger thing” has a harder time coming out: Perhaps it doesn’t exist.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/books/review/jack-london-an-american-life-by-earle-labor.html

Fatas believes, however, that the business cycle is better seen as occasional drops below potential output, then returns to trend — a view that makes good policy much more important. I agree.

2013-12-30,Game Theory: The Year of the Blockbuster,"When I look back at a year of playing video games in 2013, many of my favorite moments come from the putatively soulless games made by hundreds of people on behalf of multinational corporations. Among them are Ellie’s discovery of the giraffes in Utah in The Last of Us, along with the joy of getting to play as Ellie in the sequence called “Winter,” and the bleakness of the game’s final seconds, which sit alongside the end of the movie “Blue Jasmine” as the most unforgiving closing scenes in all of entertainment this year. Also memorable is Trevor’s May-December romance with Patricia Madrazo in Grand Theft Auto V, revealing the tender side of a psychopath, capped by the long, bittersweet drive back to Martin Madrazo’s house while listening to Chicago’s “If You Leave Me Now.” And in BioShock Infinite what stuck with me was everything from the game’s audacious first hour or so, the racist Boxer Rebellion and Battle of Wounded Knee exhibitions from the Hall of Heroes, and listening to Elizabeth sing “Will the Circle Be Unbroken.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/game-theory-the-year-of-the-blockbuster/

2013-12-30,Calder Lawsuit Dismissed,"A $20 million fraud lawsuit filed by the heirs of the sculptor Alexander Calder against the estate of his art dealer, Klaus G. Perls, has been dismissed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit claimed that Perls and his family held on to hundreds of Calder’s works, cheated the artist’s estate out of tens of millions of dollars over the course of three decades and sold fake Calder works. According to the decision by Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich, made public last week, the various claims are “an incoherent stew of irrelevance and innuendo” and the evidence failed to show that any fraud had been committed. “All these allegations are so patently inadequate that the court can only conclude that they were brought solely for the purpose of harassment or embarrassment,” Judge Kornreich said. The lawsuit was filed in 2010, two years after Mr. Perls died. His wife, Dolly, and employees of his gallery have also died. Calder died in 1976, leaving Judge Kornreich to conclude, “Plaintiffs are attempting to litigate issues that necessarily stretch back decades without any personal knowledge or contemporaneous records, where nearly all of the people who had personal knowledge of the facts of the case are dead.” Perls represented Calder for more than 20 years, and they were considered friends who frequently dined and traveled together and visited each other’s families.

Russell.

But “it takes a sure hand to know when to eliminate the superfluous and let a story unfold on its own terms,” she added. “When Mr. Russell begins to do that in the latter half of ‘Three Kings,’ his film begins homing in on the political and moral conundrums that were always at the heart of this material.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

By substituting effervescent wine for the piney, citrusy sweetness of gin, he’d somehow stripped the Negroni down to its essence. Sbagliatos retain that pleasing chalkiness and minerality of Campari and the herby qualities of vermouth, but these flavors stretch out across the bubbles and somehow lead one to drink more slowly, savoring the medley. Unlike Negronis, which are all booze but taste like adult candy, Sbagliatos are less likely to put one’s party-appropriate sobriety at risk. But if they do wind up going down a little too quickly, rest easy — the Sbagliato is significantly lower in alcohol by volume than its brawnier big brother, a key consideration in the holiday marathon drinking season.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/cocktail-culture-a-bubbly-twist-on-the-negroni/

2013-12-31,China: Police Kill 8 Assailants in a Clash in Xinjiang," Security officers on Monday killed eight attackers and detained one person as the police repelled an assault on a police station in the western region of Xinjiang, government officials said. A report on Tianshan News, the official news website of Xinjiang, said nine people armed with knives had attacked a police station in Shache County, near Kashgar. The attackers also threw explosive devices and set police cars on fire, the report said. It provided no further details. Violence between civilians and security forces has become increasingly common in Xinjiang, where officials say they are trying to deal with rebels or terrorists who live in towns heavily populated by ethnic Uighurs. But Uighurs in the area and some scholars in Beijing and abroad say the Chinese government exaggerates the terrorist threat and is instead mostly deploying security forces to maintain tight control over people who feel oppressed by the ethnic Han authorities.
