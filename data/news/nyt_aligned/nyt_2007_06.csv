The new regulations will require banks to pay a more competitive rate of about 2.7 percent.

That’s very interesting, because David Gordon is first rate and not ideological, and because Policy Planning is a key portfolio in any administration in developing long-range policy. Of course, hard-liners in the Office of the Vice President can still out-maneuver the sensible people, as they have for most of the last six years, but it’s nice to see good people appointed to top posts. Steve Clemons, who writes the Note, says that Gordon’s appointment is indicative of better people going into posts more recently, and maybe there’s some truth to that. If the administration had started with Bob Gates and Gordon England at the Pentagon, instead of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, with Zoellick at the World Bank — and, best of all, with somebody like Tom Ridge as vice president rather than Cheney — then Bush might have avoided a failed presidency.

That's a source of pride for a city that clings to its history. Wander around, and you get the sense that Florentines never got the memo that Italy's capital moved south 140 years ago.

2007-06-04,When Should a Kid Start Kindergarten?,"According to the apple-or-coin test, used in the Middle Ages, children should start school when they are mature enough for the delayed gratification and abstract reasoning involved in choosing money over fruit. In 15th- and 16th-century Germany, parents were told to send their children to school when the children started to act “rational.” And in contemporary America, children are deemed eligible to enter kindergarten according to an arbitrary date on the calendar known as the birthday cutoff — that is, when the state, or in some instances the school district, determines they are old enough. The birthday cutoffs span six months, from Indiana, where a child must turn 5 by July 1 of the year he enters kindergarten, to Connecticut, where he must turn 5 by Jan. 1 of his kindergarten year. Children can start school a year late, but in general they cannot start a year early. As a result, when the 22 kindergartners entered Jane Andersen’s class at the Glen Arden Elementary School near Asheville, N.C., one warm April morning, each brought with her or him a snack and a unique set of gifts and challenges, which included for some what’s referred to in education circles as “the gift of time.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/magazine/03kindergarten-t.html

Toward the end of it, he harvested some of the traditional honors associated with such status: a CBE, a Booker Prize, six-figure advances, knighthood. These he had earned through decades of clockwork productivity, the kind of brisk, un-neurotic industriousness more often associated with Major British Authors than with their American cousins. There was a new novel every couple of years — more than 20 in all — and in the intervals between them a steady outpouring of stories, reviews, poems, opinion pieces and travelogues. As a biographical note at the front of one of Amis’s later books put it, “he has written ephemerally on politics, education, language, films, television, restaurants and drink.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Scott-t.html

After several exotic postings, the family settled in London when John was 7. Scarred slightly by boarding school and immensely by his brother’s suicide in 1970, Mellor slacked through art school, renamed himself Woody Mellor, wandered and squatted and scrounged, renamed himself Joe Strummer, and began his pursuit of stardom by singing in the pub-rock 101’ers. From that rather trad band, he was recruited by the theoretically left-wing schemer-manager Bernie Rhodes to join the punk radicals the Clash in 1976. Other members were the pop-savvy guitarist Mick Jones, the style-setting bassist Paul Simonon and, eventually, the deft power drummer Topper Headon.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Christgau-t.html

Savage, a 39-year-old former suit from Cheshire, England, decided five years ago that she’d rather die an adventurer than an I.T. project manager. Both she and the Sedna proved their seaworthiness during the 2,550-mile Trans-Atlantic Row in 2006, a race that took her 103 days (she finished 20th out of 26 boats; 6 abandoned the race). This time, the task is even more imposing: she will row 2,600 miles to Hawaii, the first leg of a three-part, 6,700-mile journey across the Pacific that will end in Australia in 2009.

2007-06-04,Visuals,"The term “small press” usually refers to independent publishers with limited means and large ambitions. For the creators of an old literary genre, however, the phrase described the machinery on which very, very tiny books were produced. Bound miniature books were common in medieval and Renaissance times as illuminated manuscripts, and in the 18th and 19th centuries as everything from alphabet primers to novels; present-day artists have also used them as a medium. Although some may look like dollhouse props, these miniatures are by no means toys. Rather, they are meant to be read and collected. In MINIATURE BOOKS: 4,000 Years of Tiny Treasures (Abrams/Grolier Club, $40), Anne C. Bromer and Julian I. Edison chronicle this legacy of petite functional volumes, including some of the quirkiest — like “Thoughts From the Cork” (1981), with a cover fashioned from a 1 5/8-by-1-inch wine cork.

Mark Twain wrote rapturously of his first encounter with surfing, watching a native Hawaiian “face the shore and wait for a particularly prodigious billow to come along; at the right moment he would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board, and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell!” When people started to explore the Internet, which promised endless possibility to anyone with a computer, they called it surfing.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/sports/playmagazine/0603play-entertain.html

A recent “Book at Bedtime” title was Ian McEwan’s “On Chesil Beach” (see the review this week). Because McEwan’s novel is about a sexually awkward honeymoon, though, the decision to read it out loud made at least one McEwan fan nervous. Writing in The Times of London, the comedian and columnist David Baddiel wasn’t worried he’d “hear descriptions so frank and graphic that they would cause me to swerve off the road in shame.” He simply worried, he wrote, “for any author who attempts any kind of elaborate sex scene, because of the possibility that it may come to the notice of the Bad Sex police.” (Much ado is made in Britain about the Bad Sex in Fiction award, handed out annually by The Literary Review.) Baddiel was relieved to find that McEwan’s sex scenes were written in “grandmaster prose” — is that a good thing or a bad thing? — “so McEwan buys himself a free pass out of the Bad Sex award.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/03tbr.html

2007-06-04,Parallel Paths,"The protagonist of Javier Cercas’s 2001 novel, “Soldiers of Salamis,” self-deprecatingly claims he can’t give up writing because his writing never amounted to anything to begin with. Cercas could say the same for his own career as a Spanish novelist — until that book, a stealthily brilliant semifictional account of the Spanish Civil War, became an unexpected best seller in Spain and abroad. Now Cercas has written another novel about the aftermath of war — this time the Vietnam War — and art has caught up with life: his writer protagonist is wildly, cravenly successful, and Cercas-the-author embarks on a dual reckoning with the nature of war and the writing life.

On the other hand, if your novel happens to be as finely wrought, deeply felt and mercifully funny as Helen Schulman’s “Day at the Beach,” then this timing turns out to be an affirming coincidence, allowing us to see how another talented writer can alchemize that same terrible day.

As the next episodes unfolded, the audience wrestled with an uneasy concept: a nuclear strike isn’t the end of the world — that is, not for its survivors.

It’s nominally a documentary (Oscar-nominated in that category in 1989), but it documents something that only faintly resembles waking reality.

Whereas a D-Day comes around only once a war, the Super Bowl adds another Roman numeral every January (or February), and college basketball gives us the Final Four like clockwork every March (or April). This all but guarantees that in 5- or 10-year increments, we will look back in sepia tones with weepy eyes at various athletic accomplishments, replaying their “firsts” and measuring their importance. Only a few justify such commemoration. Some live on from sheer spontaneous drama, as with Bobby Thomson’s 1951 home run. Some gather weight over time, as with the victory of Texas Western’s black starting five against an all-white Kentucky team in the 1966 N.C.A.A. basketball finals. And a handful are heavy with significance both at the moment and long beyond, as with Jackie Robinson’s entry into major-league baseball as its first modern-day African-American player, 60 years ago this season — an operatic tale cannily orchestrated by Branch Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and brilliantly performed by Robinson.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Jennings-t.html

Once while wreck diving for a television documentary, I unexpectedly found myself surrounded by several pregnant tiger sharks. Euphorically succumbing to nitrogen narcosis, I was drawn to the sharks, dopily fixated on the commingling of species, wondering why we couldn’t all just get along, until my dive master dragged me to safety. (Perhaps I should have been more concerned about the food chain.) In any case, I initially wrote off my ill-timed reverie on interdependence as the reaction of a stoned neophyte diver.

They wait to hear a term-biscuit, walk-and an inflection they know. What a stream of incomprehensible signs passes over them as they wait, patiently, for one of a few familiar words! Because they do not speak, except in the most limited fashion, we are always trying to figure them out. The expression is telling: to ""figure out"" is to make figures of speech, to invent metaphors to help us understand the world. To choose to live with a dog is to agree to participate in a long process of interpretation-a mutual agreement, though the human being holds most of the cards.

2007-06-04,‘Josephine Baker in Art and Life’,"Josephine Baker's cultural legacy is still alive beyond the hundredth anniversary of her birth in 1906. It exists in live performances, art, photography, fashion, film, literature, and social activism. Baker mesmerized audiences during her lifetime and continues to attract and mystify biographers. Much recent scholarship on Baker has placed her in a pantheon of black feminist heroines, which often has produced a larger-than-life, one-dimensional image. Regardless of the reasons for such depictions, there is a need to remove Baker from reductive stereotypes and to humanize her legacy. This book explores the complex construction of Baker's multiple images in art and life. It is concerned with how art transforms social life, and how life imitates art. Although it presents and evaluates carefully researched biographical facts, it is not a biography. Rather, it offers critical reflections on the symbolic Baker and the images that she and her collaborators constructed during the era of modernity and for the postmodern future.

Both modernist architecture and modernist city planning had been very successful in Britain-as indeed they have been almost everywhere-in shaping new towns and rebuilding the centers of old cities and towns. But ordinary people often looked on the results with dismay. The prince's interventions and criticisms received wide publicity, and were effective in derailing some high-profile projects by modernist architects.

2007-06-04,‘Contested Waters’," Philadelphia opened one of the earliest municipal pools in America on June 21, 1884, at the intersection of Twelfth and Wharton Streets. The ""swimming bath,"" as it was commonly called, was so popular with the boys and young men of this immigrant, working-class neighborhood that they regularly waited an hour in line to enter. During the first few days, the crowd outside the pool often became unruly. The youths argued, fought, and tried to sneak ahead of one another in line. On the night of June 24, the usual ruckus escalated into a small riot. It started when the superintendent informed the expectant swimmers that they would not be admitted that evening because the pool was already filled to capacity. As the crowd grew incensed, the superintendent retreated inside the building and bolted the door. According to a local newspaper, the fifty or so young men who had been turned away ""concluded to override his authority by the superiority of their numbers."" They tore the door from its hinges and knocked down the fence that surrounded the pool. The city had stationed a police detail at the pool in anticipation of disorderly behavior, but the four officers were no match for the angry crowd. They were ""tossed about like little bits of driftwood in rough water."" Police reinforcements eventually restored order ""with a liberal application of their clubs,"" but not before the pool and the reputation of the bathers had been severely damaged. The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorialized that ""the good [the pool] has accomplished amongst the unwashed down-town youths has been more than counterbalanced by the harm a certain gang of roughs has seen fit in their ignorant and brutal natures to inflict."" Commissioner of City Property William Dixey, whose department administered the pool, promised that ""if such conduct is kept up,"" he would ""close the house and keep it closed.""

2007-06-04,‘On Chesil Beach’," They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible. But it is never easy. They had just sat down to supper in a tiny sitting room on the first floor of a Georgian inn. In the next room, visible through the open door, was a four-poster bed, rather narrow, whose bedcover was pure white and stretched startlingly smooth, as though by no human hand. Edward did not mention that he had never stayed in a hotel before, whereas Florence, after many trips as a child with her father, was an old hand. Superficially, they were in fine spirits. Their wedding, at St. Mary's, Oxford, had gone well; the service was decorous, the reception jolly, the send-off from school and college friends raucous and uplifting. Her parents had not condescended to his, as they had feared, and his mother had not significantly misbehaved, or completely forgotten the purpose of the occasion. The couple had driven away in a small car belonging to Florence's mother and arrived in the early evening at their hotel on the Dorset coast in weather that was not perfect for mid-July or the circumstances, but entirely adequate: it was not raining, but nor was it quite warm enough, according to Florence, to eat outside on the terrace as they had hoped. Edward thought it was, but, polite to a fault, he would not think of contradicting her on such an evening. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/chapters/0603-1st-mcew.html

There at the dock waited the ship's only cargo: a forty-four-year-old Anglican rector named Thomas Gage. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/chapters/0603-1st-talt.html
2007-06-04,‘The Sack of Panama’," 'Land ahead on the starboard bow!' It was noon on 25 May 1666 when the ageing privateer, Captain Edward Mansfield, heard the lookout's cry. He clambered up into the rigging to check his position. One quick look through his perspective glass and he could relax. There was no mistaking the rugged hills, over a thousand feet high, of the lonely island which the English called Providence and the Spaniards called Santa Catalina. The old captain glanced back at the rest of his squadron. All four ships were still in sight, spread out across the otherwise empty sea. They all looked as though they had been a long time out of port, weather-beaten, paint faded, sails patched, but still moving well through the water, their bottoms clean after a recent careening. Three of them were very small, lateen-rigged sloops with no deck or cabin to protect their cramped crews from sun and sea and rain; and even the fourth was only about fifty tons, a small, square-rigged, half-decked frigate which, like Mansfield's own similar ship, had been recently captured from the Spaniards off the Central American coast. None of them carried many cannon, but no one who saw them would have been in any doubt that they were best to be avoided. Small, fast ships like these, crammed with men who knew from experience that four muskets could do as much execution as one cannon, had terrorized the waters and coastal settlements of the Caribbean for decades. Mansfield signalled the frigate to furl her topsails to reduce visibility and crept forward towards his goal. By late afternoon he was only twelve miles from the southernmost point of the island, and the squadron hove to until nightfall. Tomorrow, with any luck, the island would be his.

This absorbing history recreates the Pilgrims’ perilous 1620 voyage, the founding of the Plymouth Colony and its first contacts with the native inhabitants of Massachusetts. Philbrick, the author of the National Book Award-winning “In the Heart of the Sea,” finds striking parallels between past and present, particularly the way Plymouth’s leaders, including Miles Standish, rejected diplomatic overtures toward the Indians and instead pursued a policy of violent aggression that led to the needless bloodshed of King Philip’s War.

2007-06-04,Food Fight!,"Back to the farm? Several writers — notably Barbara Kingsolver and Michael Pollan — have written best-sellers urging us eat local and organic, but Ronald Bailey at Reason has some qualms:Kingsolver adopts absolutely every one the modern urban fables with regard to food production, starting with the claim that organic is more nutritious. There is very little scientific evidence for that claim. In addition, organic is not necessarily better for nature since yields are generally lower than conventional farming, which means that more land must be used to produce food. Reading Kingsolver, one could also conclude that pesticides were created by giant chemical companies whose sole aim was to cause cancer. But even the American Cancer Society agrees that there is “no evidence that residues of pesticides and herbicides at the low doses found in foods increase the risk of cancer.” Studies also show that eliminating pesticides could cut corn yields by 30 percent, rice by 57 percent, soybeans by 37 percent, and wheat by 24 percent. Again, that would mean that a lot more of nature would have to be plowed up to maintain the food supply at current levels.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/food-fight/

2007-06-05,Albany: Monitoring for Acid Rain,"Officials with the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, are lobbying to reverse planned reductions in the federal budget that would severely limit or eliminate several acid rain monitoring programs. The proposed budget would cut $1 million, about 25 percent, from one program that measures atmospheric gases. Two other programs that sample lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other areas of the Northeast on an annual combined budget of less than $1 million would also be eliminated. Acid rain remains a serious problem in many parts of the country, but nowhere has it been more damaging than in the Adirondacks, where vast forests have been decimated and more than 500 lakes and ponds have been left unable to support many species of native fish. “Closing down, even for a few months, will wipe out 21 years of continuously collected scientific data,” Brian L.

Often my answer is, “How about Italian food?” There are superb Italian restaurants in Bangkok. Within a 15-minute walk of my apartment in the Langsuan area I can count more than a half-dozen. Thais have long had an affinity for Italian food and at some point over the past decade the number of high-end Italian restaurants reached a critical mass. It became profitable to fly in a whole range of meats and ingredients as varied as fresh mozzarella di bufala and Sorrento lemons (one chef insists that only lemons from southern Italy will do the trick for his Tagliatelle al Limone). This week a group of Italian chefs has banded together to put on what they are calling, “The Splendor of Italian Cuisine.” I certainly agree with the concept. The festival, which is being held at 11 top Italian restaurants in the capital through June 10, has the faint whiff of a marketing gimmick. But I’m a sucker for gimmicks that involve risotto and prosciutto crudo. Biscotti, the Italian restaurant at the Four Seasons (Tel: +66 2 255 5443), offers a 6-course menu for 1,500 baht ($44). Other restaurants involved in the festival include La Scala at the Sukhothai hotel (Tel: +66 2 344 8888) Spasso at the Grande Hyatt Erawan (Tel: +66 2 254 12340) and Gianni’s on Soi Tonson, near Central Chidlom department store (Tel: +66 2 252 1619).

Cutting those areas of pollution are the main indicators in China’s nationwide plan for a 10 percent reduction in pollution by 2010. Last year, China failed to meet its goal of two percent reductions in each category and instead registered small increases. But Mr. Zhang said improvements had become evident after government programs to install pollution technology on coal-fired power plants, as well as the installation of new wastewater treatment equipment. He acknowledged that other pollutants, including ammonia, continued to rise.

Mickelson is skipping this week’s Stanford St. Jude Championship and says he’ll be fine for the Open, at the Oakmont Country Club in Pittsburgh, but ailing wrists and deep rough don’t make an ideal golf pairing. After all, Mickelson injured the wrist during a recent practice round at Oakmont. Pros who are practicing there this week are saying the course is tougher than Winged Foot, where the winning score was 5 over. There’s already enough preying on a golfer’s mind at a U.S. Open — it features the harshest conditions and the most grueling mental challenge.

Justice Reichbach called a series of hearings compelling prosecutors to show good cause for their delay in bringing charges.

In “The Perfect Man,” his third novel, Murr, who was born and raised in London and now lives in the United States, brings his slightly gothic sensibility to bear on the heart of America. The book takes place chiefly in Pisgah, Mo., the small town where Rajiv Travers, a half-Indian, half-English boy, comes of age in the 1950s. This “Our Town”-ish locale is an ideal showcase for Murr’s impressive talents, previously deployed on a widely divergent cast of British characters. Here, Murr weaves an elaborate plot, shifting perspective between small-town characters — adults, outcasts and the handful of teenagers who form the novel’s core.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/books/review/Kamine-t.html

According to a trailer from Lionsgate, which last fall packaged some of these DVD releases as an “After Dark HorrorFest: Eight Movies to Die For,” this is because the content of certain movies is “considered too graphic, too disturbing and too shocking for general audiences.” Only Lionsgate, the trailer went on to say, had “defied the system” by delivering such material right to the home DVD player.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/movies/homevideo/10mcgr.html

It is an island paradise containing every possible indulgence that someone with a great deal of money and an enormous need to be coddled might desire. Fisher Island’s fortunate 1,400, fewer than one-third of them full-time residents, can play on the golf course created by P. B.

The sand on the beach is imported from the Bahamas and cleared daily of seaweed, so it is always soft and white. There are swimming pools, not just at the health spa, but also in each condo complex. Perpetually blooming tropical flowers perfume the air; caged toucans twitter in banyan trees, flamingos wade lazily in their own private pond.

(Think of “Saturday Night Live.”) The content may be funny, but Mr. Zalben and his co-producers, Keith Michel, Becky Poole and Elizabeth Ellis, are serious about this type of humor. “We weren’t going to aim for being the biggest,” Mr. Zalben said. “It’s more important to aim for a consistent level of quality.” Instead of opening the festival to all performers, the producers watched more than 100 live-performance tapes, and chose 21 groups for the festival.

I was 11, and like millions of people, I couldn’t get enough of the “Shy Di” fairy tale: ugly (O.K., gangly) duckling meets handsome (O.K., gangly) prince and becomes luminous royal swan. In the new couple’s honor, I spent a month’s allowance on wedding memorabilia. My prize purchase was a Diana coffee mug with a wide-brimmed ceramic hat. “Only the girls are going in for this lot,” the sales clerk grumbled. He might have been talking about the fairy princess myth itself. Sometimes against their better judgment, women the world over were entranced by the prospect of untold leisure, unequaled glamour and redemptive metamorphosis that this particular myth promised. Ladies, let’s be honest: who really among us hasn’t dreamed of becoming a princess?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/books/review/Weber-t.html

And so it was fitting that John Edwards, announcing his candidacy for president at the end of last year, chose as his setting not his hometown, Robbins, N.C., where he unveiled his first presidential campaign four years earlier, but the front yard of a mangled brick house in New Orleans’s Upper Ninth Ward. New Orleans is the new national shorthand for neglect, and it is, not coincidentally, the spiritual center of Edwards’s campaign. After Hurricane Katrina washed away, with brutal efficiency, some of America’s most impoverished neighborhoods, Edwards took more than 700 students to the submerged city to help rebuild homes and schools, and in the months since then, he has never stayed away for long. “I can always tell when he’s been to New Orleans,” says Bruce Raynor, a co-president of the hotel and garment workers’ union, who is close to the former senator. “His passions are stirred.

Most Americans “cannot name one of the four Gospels,” Prothero writes, “and many high school seniors think that Sodom and Gomorrah were husband and wife.” Religious illiteracy cuts across generations, and the devout scarcely know more than the secular do.

2007-06-12,Passport Pandemonium,"PASSPORT PANDEMONIUM The confusion and delays in passport processing are a warning to plan far ahead to renew or obtain a passport, travel industry trade groups say. Since Jan 23, United States citizens as well as those from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean have been required for the first time to present a valid passport when entering the United States by air. A rush for passports has created long processing delays, partly because of confusion among some travelers, who mistakenly thought they needed a passport to return to the United States from Canada or Mexico by car. That requirement will not take effect until next year. Maura Harty, the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, said that the demand for passports was “over and beyond even the enormous demand we had expected,” leading to the delays. In response, the State Department adjusted the rules so that through Sept. 30, those who can show proof they have applied for a passport, even if they have not received it, are exempt. The required documents are a government-issued photo ID and a printout showing that they have applied for a passport, which can be downloaded from travel.state.gov.passport.

2007-06-12,"Sleek, Fast and Focused: The Cells That Make Dad Dad","We are fast approaching Father’s Day, the festive occasion on which we plague Dad with yet another necktie or collect phone call and just generally strive to remind the big guy of the central verity of paternity — that it’s a lot more fun to become a father than to be one. “I won’t lie to you,” said the great Homer Simpson. “Fatherhood isn’t easy like motherhood.” Yet in our insistence that men are more than elaborately engineered gamete vectors, we neglect the marvels of their elaborately engineered gametes. As the scientists who study male germ cells will readily attest, sperm are some of the most extraordinary cells of the body, a triumph of efficient packaging, sleek design and superspecialization. Human sperm are extremely compact, and they’ve been stripped of a normal cell’s protein-making machinery; but when cast into the forbidding environment of the female reproductive tract, they will learn on the job and change their search strategies and swim strokes as needed.

Millions of Rwandans left Rwanda in the decades of instability leading up to the genocide, and many settled permanently in surrounding countries. Some have since been forcibly sent back, including this group of about 2,000 people from Tanzania. The group we encountered had all been settled in Tanzania since the 1980s, and had established sustainable farms and small businesses. Many were even born in Tanzania and had never set foot in Rwanda. Last November, they were stripped of their belongings and chased out of their villages, and told to return to Rwanda. Rwanda has a right of return policy reminiscent of Israel. (“Rwanda will never turn away our own people,” a Rwandan woman told us, “We are one people, and no matter where they come from, they belong with us.”) The refugees, or more correctly, the returnees, were welcome into the country.

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, upholds most of an earlier decision by a federal judge in Brooklyn. The officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller, the head of the F.B.I., had asked for dismissal of the lawsuit, by Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani immigrant, arguing in part that the government was entitled to take actions that might not have been lawful before 9/11. Although acknowledging some forms of government action in emergencies may exceed normal constitutional limits, Judge Jon O. Newman rejected the officials’ contention, saying some protections against some of the violations claimed, such as needlessly harsh confinement and ethnic discrimination, do not vary with surrounding circumstances. “The strength of our system of constitutional rights derives from the steadfast protection of those rights in both normal and unusual times,” he wrote.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/nyregion/15mbrfs-immigrant.html

One was by Clutch, a long-running, hard-touring band that has been around since 1991. Clutch played beefy, beery blues-rock, with vintage guitar riffs and growly vocals upholstered in harmonica and organ. It’s the kind of band that reminds a Yankee that Bonnaroo takes place in Southern rock territory. But it’s not that simple. Clutch’s lyrics don’t leer and swagger as the sound might suggest. They are convoluted and philosophical, closer to Pearl Jam than to Ten Years After. They ponder ethics, politics, faith and the devil as the music steams along: “Yes, I’ll be a responsible member/of this great and bless’d society./I’ve come to understand the wrongful nature/of gun ownership in the age of monarchy.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/bonnaroo-beery-blues-rock-and-jazz-anarchy/

James (Blood) Ulmer led a jazz-rock power trio in a set that fell into a pattern: he sang blues songs alternating with instrumentals. The blues were political and personal complaints, including denunciations of the war, a song about Hurricane Katrina and a song about money troubles that announced, “I ain’t broke but I’m badly bent.” And the instrumentals veered toward the harmolodic zigzags of Ornette Coleman: setting out melodies at willful, shifty speeds, improvising over a vamp. In both blues and instrumentals, he loosed a new idea at each break: searing sustained lines, phrases that scurried into different keys, bent and wah-wahed notes, crunched funk chords. Each idea could have been the seed of a whole solo, but Mr. Ulmer kept coming up with more.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/bonnaroo-two-well-traveled-guitarists/

But musically, Tool isn’t that much of a stretch from Bonnaroo’s Saturday headliner, the Police.

A few days later, a friend sent me Donald Hall’s book about Eagle Pond, his home in New Hampshire, and there were more woodcuts: of skaters on the ice, a dog curled at his master’s feet, clouds billowing over mountains, clapboard houses and placid streams.

2007-06-18,Bookshelf,"EVERY FRIDAY. By Dan Yaccarino. Henry Holt. $16.95. (Ages 3 to 7) “Friday is my favorite day,” a small boy tells us, because every Friday he and his dad go for breakfast together at the local diner. In cheerful gouache illustrations, they wave to passersby, watch shops open and buildings going up; “everyone is rushing, but we’re taking our time.” A note from the author tells us the book is based on his weekly ritual with his own son. It is also a valentine to good dads and neighborhood diners, and a reminder on Father’s Day that the “little traditions” are sometimes the best ones.

Historians identified it last week as part of a bomb lance, a harpoon manufactured for only a few years in the late 1800s in New Bedford, Mass. Whalers probably fired it at the bowhead around 1890, when the whale was probably a teenager, and it carried the harpoon for the next 115 years before finally being killed by a modern one.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/weekinreview/17zimmer.html

This meant he was cautious and prudent, and therefore good at not losing his clients’ money. But banking had also made him cynical. It was a truism that those who already had money would find it easy to increase their wealth, and they never seemed very grateful for Allan’s work on their (often unmerited) behalf. Some of the High Net Worth individuals on his books owned three or four homes, yachts, racehorses, private islands and numerous works of art. Yet they seemed to appreciate very little, being too busy amassing yet more. He found them dull and blinkered, and wondered if they thought of him the same way. Then there were his fellow account executives at First Caledonian Bank, some of whom hardly registered his existence. The chief executive had met him a dozen times, yet never seemed to remember him. With a drink in one hand and a canapé in the other, he would regale Allan time and again with the same anecdote, while Allan smiled and tried to sound interested throughout and surprised by the predictable punch line.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17funny-serial-t.html

What’s-his-name’s shrill response before running away — “You’re crazy, you know that? Besides, you throw like a girl!” — prompts hilarity from the women. “You’re so much smarter than me,” says What’s-his-name’s girlfriend. “I don’t see you with a jerk.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/Egan-t.html

Praised for the ingenuity of its plotting, this accomplished book also won plaudits for the authenticity of its detail and its almost queasily intense exuberance. Clark, who paid generous acknowledgment to the inspiration of Peter Ackroyd’s pyrotechnic style, joined him as a highflier, soaring through a dreamscape of her own imagining, yet grounding it in the bricks, mortar and mud of a well-researched past.

We are currently living through a good example of this in the immigration debate.” As for race relations today, he thinks “extremism on both sides is flatly rejected.

2007-06-18,The Inner Lives of Men,"Since academic novels usually focus on the nasty rivalries and inflated egos of their characters, they have served as vehicles for broad satire, not serious themes. One great exception is Willa Cather’s 1925 novel, “The Professor’s House.” Cather used the traditional calling of a scholar and the atrophy of his marriage to convey her own growing alienation from the modern world. Her novel has only one successor, another book that invokes the life of learning as a rebuke to the wasteful wars and cheap compromises of the wider world. John Williams’s “Stoner” is something rarer than a great novel — it is a perfect novel, so well told and beautifully written, so deeply moving, that it takes your breath away. Ignored on publication in 1965, a clamorous year, it has been kept alive by enthusiasts who go into print every decade to rediscover it, including Irving Howe in The New Republic in 1966, C. P. Snow in The Financial Times in 1973, Dan Wakefield in Ploughshares in 1981 and Steve Almond in Tin House in 2003. They invariably wonder why no one has heard of the book. “Why isn’t this book famous?” Snow kept asking. Now, along with Williams’s earlier novel, “Butcher’s Crossing” (1960), “Stoner” is available in a handsome reprint by New York Review Books. Both books deserve to be widely read, but their dark, comfortless vision raises the question of whether this can be expected.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/Dickstein-t.html

2007-06-18,‘Nature’s Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick’,"Printing from woodblocks is the oldest way of all. Before Gutenberg invented moveable type around 1450, books and broadsheets were produced by writing the text on wood in reverse, as in a mirror, and then cutting painstakingly round the letters, dabbing the block with ink and pressing paper on top. With the new metal type, printers still used the blocks for illustrations and a single block could be used over and over again, on different pages, in different books. The early cutters worked on the 'side-grain' of the wood, a plank cut along the trunk, often of a fruitwood such as pear or cherry, using carpenters' tools - knives, chisels and gouges. When designed by masters like Dürer or Holbein these woodcuts could attain an astounding delicacy, but increasingly book publishers preferred to use copper engravings which gave a finer effect, and the crude woodcuts were banished to broadsides and chapbooks. Slowly, however, craftsmen tried using the dense end-grain of wood, sliced across the trunk or branch rather than along it like a plank. Boxwood proved the best, because box grows so slowly that the growth-lines are very close and on its hard surface the engravers could use the fine tools employed on silver or copper.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/chapters/0617-1st-uglow.html

Perhaps that’s no suprise at a festival that includes longtime politically inclined rappers like the Roots, Michael Franti and El-P, who tour to the same collegiate audience that comes to Bonnaroo.

They left behind terse, neatly arranged studio albums and a few live recordings. Now, on tour again, they are jamming the alternatives. Their Bonnaroo set interspersed familiar arrangements with new ones, often within the same song.

In early July, Dior will celebrate its 60th anniversary with a show at Versailles. Valentino will have a 45th blow-out in Rome. There’s a sense, however, that couture is again in some kind of transit phase. The Valentino company has a new owner and there’s a question of what will happen to couture when Valentino retires. This past Thursday, in Paris, I sat down with Alber Elbaz to ask what couture means to a younger generation of design innovators. What would induce a designer like Elbaz, or Marc Jacobs, or Nicolas Ghesquiere, to want to be part of an old-school couture house?

2007-06-18,The Death of an Italian Innovator,"Wire services in Italy and France report this evening in Italy that Gianfranco Ferre has died at the age of 62. He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on Friday in Milan and was hospitalized. Ferre was for many years a leading designer in Milan, beginning his career in the mid 1970s after receiving a degree in architecture. There was always something over-the-top about Ferre’s clothes—the white shirt collars always high and sculptural, the leather often laced and assertive, the coats swinging. I once began a review of a Ferre show, in the early 90s, with: “Diva, can you dig it?” His clothes had a great sexual energy, if you got your head into them, and I loved that he didn’t seem to care a jot about trends and skinny models and so forth. His Dior period was not especially memorable, at least for me, and perhaps that’s because he never seemed very happy there (living in the Plaza Athenee), and of course Dior in the early 90s was in transition, not the old style but not quite yet the new era of Galliano and Bernard Arnault.

2007-06-19,Bob Barker Gives CBS a Good Goodbye,"After five decades on network television, Bob Barker appeared on CBS’s “Price is Right” Friday for the last time, ending 35 years as host of America’s longest-running game show. Nielsen estimated 8.7 million viewers tuned in at 8 p.m. to watch the prime-time encore of the farewell show, which CBS televised earlier Friday in its usual daytime slot. Following the sendoff, CBS broadcast the “34th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards,” during which Mr. Barker was honored with his 19th trophy. The awards show drew 8.3 million viewers from 9 to 11, putting the network in first place for the night. CBS was also No. 1 on Sunday, getting a boost from back-to-back repeats of “Cold Case” at 8 (7.2 million) and at 9 (9 million) followed by “Without a Trace” at 10 (8.6 million). But NBC finished on top for the night among adults 18 to 49, benefiting from a 45-minute overrun of its U.S. Open golf coverage in the 7 p.m. hour. From 9 to 11 a repeat of NBC’s “Last Comic Standing” led the time period in the demographic, while attracting only 4.9 million viewers.

The lawsuit, brought by Martin R. Hyde, a former general manager at Dillon’s in Manhattan, said Mr. Ramsay falsely claimed that meat was spoiled, used a defective chair to imply that the restaurant’s furniture was shoddy and hired actors to pose as customers to make the restaurant appear busy by the end of the week. Asking for millions in damages and a court order to stop the show from being broadcast as scheduled in the fall, Mr. Hyde also maintained that Mr. Ramsay humiliated him and drove him to quit to avoid further abuse. James Curich, a spokesman for Mr. Ramsay, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not seen it. Jennifer Sprague, a Fox spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said she could not comment, and Andrew Blackmore, a manager at Dillon’s, said he had signed a release stating that he could not discuss the show with the news media. A year ago Mr. Ramsay won $138,000 and an apology in a libel suit in London against the publishers of The Evening Standard, which had accused him of faking scenes in his reality show “Kitchen Nightmares,” also about a restaurant makeover. “I won’t let people write anything they want about me,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/arts/21arts-002.html

The woman, Lucinda Pettway Franklin, contends that one of the dealers, Matt Arnett, asked two years ago to borrow the quilts to have them examined and photographed for a book. But the quilts, along with another made by her mother and an aunt, have not been returned, despite requests, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in Alabama. Newer quilts of their kind sell for tens of thousands of dollars; the value of older ones is much higher. The suit is the third filed recently against Mr. Arnett; his brother, Paul; and his father, William, who have long represented and promoted the quilters in Gee’s Bend, an isolated, historically black community. Two earlier suits say that the Arnetts have defrauded Gee’s Bend quilters. Gregory H. Hawley, a lawyer representing the Arnetts, was unavailable for comment yesterday, his law firm said. In previous interviews he has denied the claims in the first two lawsuits. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/arts/21arts-007.html

They have focused either on the processes of decision-making and their implementation or on the world of suffering and death experienced by the victims. Friedländer’s first volume stood out from most other work in this field because it successfully combined both of these aspects. And his second volume does so as well.

Scandinavians differentiate between loneliness and solitude as a matter of course. But Trond, insinuating at times, but colloquial and close to one’s ear, tells a candid story so concretely that the reader has to live it out. “I have been lucky,” he says of his life, while acknowledging that he has always longed to be alone. Has the death of his wife liberated him? He says only, “I lost interest in talking to people.” He will indeed learn to talk, alone, in the middle of a train of thought when “the difference between talking and not talking is slowly wiped out.” Reflecting upon his move to the country, he says, “I had put myself in an impossible situation.” He sleeps poorly because in the quiet, the past presses in upon him and it is disturbing. The millennium is nigh but he expects it to mean nothing. While the fireworks are elsewhere, he will get drunk and listen to Billie Holiday on his record player. We accept that cultivated people turn up in such places, though Americans tend to view them as Edward Dahlberg described the conventional view of Thoreau, “as a kind of cranky male sibyl, a crabbed and catarrhal water sprite of our woodland culture.” Trond is no Thoreau — he’s more like us than other Scandinavian protagonists including Knut Hamsun’s Lt. Glahn or Halldor Laxness’s Bjartur — but his efforts require peace and quiet.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/review/McGuane.html

Marriage — especially other people’s — is as fascinating as it is mysterious. But it takes the prism of the past to turn high gossip into cultural insight. In choosing seven “marriages à la mode” in the British literary community between 1910 and the Second World War, Katie Roiphe has hit upon a strategy that allows her to probe the mysteries of marriage with a kind of forensic delicacy. At the end of her book we feel we know these couples as intimately as if we were part of their circle, but the ultimate nature of each relationship is left inviolate in its unknowability.

2007-06-25,Piece Process,"The de facto division of Palestine over the last week into a Hamas-led enclave in Gaza and a Fatah-dominated West Bank marks a new low in the sorry annals of Palestinian affairs. Part of the blame lies with President Mahmoud Abbas, who has proved utterly unable to cope with the challenges of leadership, a fact only underscored by his “firing” of the elected Hamas government that had already in effect fired him. Israel’s wildly unpopular prime minister, Ehud Olmert (a man whose approval rating recently hit 2 percent), played a contributing role by bombing Gaza last summer (in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers), a move that further weakened Abbas and his Fatah party. The Bush administration, too, deserves its share of the blame for openly neglecting the Middle East conflict for its first four years in office. As it turned out, feeling abandoned made ordinary Palestinians despondent about the prospects for peace — which enabled them to cast protest votes for Hamas without worrying that its election would effectively scuttle an already moribund peace process.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/magazine/24wwln-lede-t.html

Its author was none other than Gerd Heinrich, his “Papa.” Why not call the book an hommage, then? It is ultimately that too, yet the whiff of theft in the air is the first clue that what follows will be no ordinary account of a son following in his father’s footsteps. This particular gene pool turns out to be something of a fever swamp, and thereby hangs a tale of two naturalists that reads like a cross between a Darwinian parable and a Nabokov novel: an absorbing scientific saga rife with uncanny twists and fraught with quandaries over the primordial tussle between nature and nurture.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/review/Barber-t.html

In an author’s note, Lowry painstakingly explains her decision “to emphasize the visual elements of Harriet’s story — what things looked like, places and clothes, faces, plants, the sky — and to thread information from the sources” listed in her bibliography “in order to come up with one version of what life might have been like for the American hero Harriet Tubman.” She also makes us aware that Tubman was one of the first American celebrities to market her own story for profit, so the first full record of her life contains material that she and her original biographer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, thought would sell.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/review/Bell.html

Reviving a 19th-century tradition, Maupin wrote the Tales in the form of a serial, with installments appearing daily in The San Francisco Chronicle. After “Sure of You” came out in 1989, Maupin declared that the series was finished, and went on to write two other novels.

2007-06-25,The Possessed,"The stones at Machu Picchu seem almost alive. They may be alive, if you credit the religious beliefs of the ruler Pachacuti Yupanqui, whose subjects in the early 15th century constructed the granite Inca complex, high above a curling river and nestled among jagged green peaks. To honor the spirits that take form as mountains, the Inca stoneworkers carved rock outcrops to replicate their shapes. Doorways and windows of sublimely precise masonry frame exquisite views. But this extraordinary marriage of setting and architecture only partly explains the fame of Machu Picchu today. Just as important is the romantic history, both of the people who built it in this remote place and of the explorer who brought it to the attention of the world.

2007-06-25,‘Uncommon Arrangements’," AUGUST 5, 1914. A few minutes after midnight as Britain was entering the war, an illegitimate baby was born in a conspicuously anonymous redbrick house on the northern coast. His mother, Rebecca West, whose real name, which nobody used, was Cicily Fairfield, held the sleeping bundle in her arms, while her sister and a friend perched on her bed. The baby's father, H. G. Wells, was one hundred miles away, sitting up late in his llama-wool pajamas, in the second-floor study of his large comfortable house in Essex, putting the finishing touches on an essay for the Daily Chronicle, which he was planning to call ""The War That Will End War."" He poured himself a cup of tea, which he had brewed himself on the small stove nestled in the fireplace, and nibbled a dry biscuit. His wife, Jane, was asleep in the bedroom, her dark blond hair fanned out against the pillow. He loved his wife, and he loved his young mistress. He loved his ivy-covered Georgian house, Easton Glebe, which was a gracious symbol of how far he had come from his hardscrabble origins. Unlike nearly everyone he knew, Wells was feeling optimistic about the war, exhilarated by the possibilities of the world in flux. Through his window he could see the familiar outline of a fig tree in the darkness. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/chapters/0622-1st-roip.html

Duke, the huge shepherd-hound that she rescued from the pound, is at her feet, and a one-legged chicken lies cradled in her lap.

A year ago, when the Lubyanka thrummed with activity, when all of Moscow seemed to hold its breath at night and every morning brought a new consignment of confiscated manuscripts to Pavel's desk, such a discovery would have hardly warranted a second look, let alone this face-to-face meeting the archivist frankly dreads. Babel has confessed: One story will not change that, nor will it save him. Still, Kutyrev has insisted the matter be formally resolved, and since Pavel must now answer to the ambitious young lieutenant, the question of authorship is to be settled, if only for the record. Already an empty office upstairs has been reserved for the purpose. In due course the appointed morning comes. Just as the first heavy drops of rain are beginning to fall onto the dreary courtyard below, a guard raps once on the door. Babel enters.

All I could do was get up, turn on the light, and throw it back out the window. It fell three stories and landed on the sidewalk below. I turned my electric blanket up to ten, got back in bed, and fell asleep. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/chapters/0622-1st-vlau.html

Although the archive has little new information about the 25 months that the Frank family and four other Jews hid from the Nazis during the occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, its value lies in illuminating the family’s cultured background in Germany and the wellsprings of Frank’s talent for writing. “They spoke four languages,” said the cousin, Bernard Elias, 82, who kept the materials in his attic in Switzerland for decades before providing them on permanent loan to the Anne Frank House, the museum incorporating the tiny apartment where the family hid. “They were interested in art, theater. When they went to a concert or play, they wrote about it. That’s all in these letters.” The donation includes a 1945 letter from Otto Frank informing his mother in Switzerland that his daughters, Anne and Margot, and his wife, Edith, had died in Nazi concentration camps; the letter his mother wrote in response to diary excerpts sent by Otto Frank; and photos from the late 1890s of the Frank family in their native Frankfurt.

2007-06-26,Examining the Archives: The C.I.A.’s ‘Family Jewels’,"The New York Times has assembled a panel of intelligence experts and historians to review and comment on documents made public today by the Central Intelligence Agency that describe a series of intelligence operations, mostly involving domestic spying, that first came to light in the 1970s. They also include some discussion of assassination plots against foreign leaders. The C.I.A. account of these activities, running nearly 700 pages, is known as the “Family Jewels.” It consists of responses by C.I.A. officials to a 1973 directive from the Director of Central Intelligence, James Schlesinger, to inform him of any activities that might violate the agency’s charter. Many pages of the material made public today were excised by the agency. Many of the operations were disclosed in press reports in the mid-1970’s beginning with a Dec. 22, 1974 story in The New York Times by Seymour M. Hersh. A commission appointed by President Gerald R. Ford and headed by his Vice President, Nelson A. Rockefeller, investigated the C.I.A. activities, as did a Senate committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, and a House committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike, Democrat of New York. The actual text of the responses to Mr. Schlesinger remained classified and unavailable to the public until today.",U.S.,https://washington.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/about-this-feature/

None of these plots ever succeeded, and many — one explored the feasibility of sending Castro a poison-laced diving suit, another tried to rig exotic exploding seashells — seem ridiculous in retrospect. One of the $64,000 questions from that time is whether these plots were known and authorized by various C.I.A. directors and others outside the agency, including the president. The Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee, spent months in 1975 and thousands of pages of testimony examining who knew what, and when. The committee found that the evidence suggested that higher-ups inside and outside the C.I.A .knew about the various assassination plots, but it was not conclusive.",U.S.,https://washington.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/a-plot-to-assassinate-castro-was-approved-by-cia-director-allen-dulles/

In October it will hold its first Middle East International Film Festival. And today it will announce an agreement with the New York Film Academy, a technical school, to open a branch in Abu Dhabi to train 100 students a year in television and film production. (Tuition at the Manhattan school is $34,000, but the emirate is likely to subsidize a portion of that.) Officials with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage also said they were soliciting investment in the Persian Gulf region for a sizable fund, to be unveiled later this summer, that would offer financial incentives for film production in Abu Dhabi exceeding those offered by governments in Europe and elsewhere. Sami el-Masri, the authority’s director of strategic planning, said the initiatives were aimed at erecting bridges across cultures in a region accustomed to destroying them: “It’s about looking for common denominators at a time when we only look at differences.” Within the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi has been in something of a footrace to announce cultural and tourist attractions, anticipating a future when the oil wells run dry.

You can never be too early in fashion these days. Elbaz has been broadening Lanvin’s concept, thinking more along the lines of a supermarket spree, something here, something there, and has come out with pajamas (Carole Lombardish), prêt-à-porter wedding dresses (throw on and go to the alter or justice of the peace), T-shirts, travel clothes and mainstay looks that will remain in stock. I especially loved a creamy white shirtdress in double-layered silk inspired by a man’s dress shirt, with a triple-layer navy chiffon minicoat. A super-simple dress made from two asymmetrical squares of black silk showed how Elbaz is such a pragmatic innovator. His other accomplishment is to bring clear design integrity to shapes that appear simple, in fabrics like polyester (yes!), washed silk and organdy, so that the clothes are hard to copy.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/lanvin-soup-to-nuts/

In London yesterday, the five-member Girl Power group of the 1990s announced plans for their first concerts since breaking up in 2001 and the first with all the members of the original ensemble since Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) left to pursue a solo career in 1998. She was on hand with Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) and Melanie Brown (Scary Spice) to say that they had agreed on 11 concerts around the world in December and January. “Obviously it’s nostalgic,” Ms. Halliwell said. “But equally, if new fans want to come along, that’s fantastic.” The tour will take them to Los Angeles (Dec. 7); Las Vegas (Dec. 8); New York (Dec. 11); London (Dec. 15); Cologne, Germany (Dec. 20); Madrid (Dec. 23); Beijing (Jan. 10); Hong Kong (Jan. 12); Sydney, Australia (Jan. 17); Cape Town (Jan. 20); and Buenos Aires (Jan. 24).

2007-06-29,'LE DOULOS',"‘LE DOULOS’ Jean-Pierre Melville’s brutal and subtly brilliant policier “Le Doulos” (shot in 1962, released in 1963) underscores why the French put the name to film noir. Based on the Pierre Lesou novel published by Gallimard in its celebrated Série Noire line, the film follows the parallel fates of two criminals — Jean-Paul Belmondo as Silien, Serge Reggiani as Maurice — bound by an almost mystical sense of masculine loyalty. Mr. Belmondo, below, who had recently worn a priest’s collar for Melville in “Léon Morin, Prêtre” (1961), enters “Le Doulos” in a more familiar Melvillian costume of a belted trench coat and fedora. A stated friend to Maurice as well as to the police, he first appears masked by an enveloping shadow, his silhouette framed in a doorway. He remains a darkly obscured figure for much of the rest of the story, a disturbing question mark for both Maurice (who believes in him) and the audience (who may not). The story eases and lurches, at times mechanistically, but what sticks and sticks hard is the way Melville fashions an entire world out of a threadbare room, a light swinging as if from a gallows, an ominous hat-check number, filigrees of cool jazz, an hourglass figure that melts into the image of a yapping dog and a masterly sense of cinematic space, exemplified by a lengthy interrogation scene. In “Le Doulos” the camera and the actors move in a silent conspiracy, revealing more about the true nature of a man far in advance of any line of dialogue. “Le Doulos” will be shown in a new 35-millimeter print, making it even easier to swoon into its darkness.

2007-06-29,NIK BARTSCH'S RONIN,"NIK BÄRTSCH’S RONIN “Zen-funk” is the term that Nik Bärtsch, a Swiss pianist, uses to describe the music of his five-piece band, Ronin, above. It’s an eminently printable phrase, but it cleanly misses the mark. True, Mr. Bärtsch composed the pieces for his recent album, “Stoa” (ECM), during a six-month residency in Japan. And, yes, at times those pieces do flirt with funkiness, though to draw allusions to James Brown, as some reviewers have, following Mr. Bärtsch’s lead, is a rather dubious stretch. The problem with the term is its connotation of mind-clearing tranquillity, when Ronin proposes something much more heady and premeditated. “Stoa,” for instance, relies on a precision movement of interlocking parts in a manner suggestive of a timepiece. (The Swiss and the Japanese have long had this expertise in common, after all.) Minimalism is a useful frame of reference, in the same way that it is for some hard-to-classify American bands. One track on the album, “Modul 35,” could be considered an acoustic corollary to the music of Battles; elsewhere there’s a vague resemblance to Tortoise. And videotape of Mr. Bärtsch and his colleagues performing “Modul 33” last fall (find it on YouTube, or at nikbaertsch.com) brings to mind the contemporary chamber group So Percussion. Next week’s showcase, which comes on the heels of festival appearances in Vancouver and Montreal, will mark Ronin’s United States debut. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Bärtsch will engage the drummer Kaspar Rast, the percussionist Andi Pupato, the bassist Björn Meyer and the clarinetist Stefan Haslebacher in a tricky yet ethereal interaction that’s more vivid in performance than on record. Maybe it will be meditative, and maybe it will get funky. Whatever the case, the crowd response will surely outdo the sound of one hand clapping.

He defended Mr. Grass, who has been attacked for what critics say is the belated acknowledgment in his new memoir, “Peeling the Onion,” that he served for a few months in the Waffen-SS as a teenager. Mr. Grass, best known for his novel “The Tin Drum,” has unflinchingly demanded that Germans account for Nazi atrocities. Mr. Mailer said he searched his own life to figure out why Mr. Grass didn’t speak about his experience earlier. “What have I held onto for so long?” he asked, and then answered: stabbing his second wife, Adele, in 1960. “It’s something I’ll probably never write about,” he said. “I’ve never felt ready to write about it.” Unless you can “write something that’s brilliant,” he added, you’re better off not writing about it at all. Mr. Grass, who said his SS experience was publicized in the 1960s, added that he always knew he would write about this period but that “I was going to write about it when I was ready.” PATRICIA COHEN",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/arts/29arts-001.html

But when Seun Kuti (above), 24, Fela’s youngest son, began performing with his father’s band, the Egypt 80, he faced another formidable contender: his older half-brother Femi, who since the late ’80s has earned the respect of critics and Afrobeat fans — not a crowd easily impressed — for his saxophone populism. Luckily or unluckily for both, their father is truly inimitable, and in addition to his music — a deliriously warped reflection of James Brown’s funk — Fela left a tradition of fearless political dissidence. As Seun Kuti told The Observer, the British newspaper, three years ago when graduating from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, his father’s music is a mission that lives on, with room for plenty of inheritors. “Things in Nigeria are even worse now,” he said, “and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness.” He brings his saxophone and his fight to S.O.B.’s on Sunday for his New York debut, and Femi Kuti and his band Positive Force appear at Central Park SummerStage on July 11.

Last week, Ghesquiere was in Milan to open a new Balenciaga shop. Another one is set to open later this year in Los Angeles.

The race was stopped for an hour as the driver was extracted from his car and sent to hospital. He is reported to be in stable condition, and basically unhurt. Like the accident in Canada, this was another of the kind where it seemed nearly impossible for the driver to have survived. Twice lucky. But it is impossible not to think of Alain Prost’s words before the death of Ayrton Senna in Imola, after Rubens Barrichello had a serious accident on the Friday and Roland Ratzenberger was killed on the Saturday.
