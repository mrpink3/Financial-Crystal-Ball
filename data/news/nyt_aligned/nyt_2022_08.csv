This year for the first time, it will run the National Yemen Coffee Auction open to roasters worldwide. The institute has selected 28 coffees, out of an original collection of 161, for the online auction; registration is open until Aug. 15 and the auction will be held Aug. 31. He said that roasters from 20 countries are expected to participate.

Because this is a slasher movie, Whistler’s overly polite demeanor carries for the audience an edge of latent menace. This is a horror flick about L.G.B.T.Q. teens at a conversion camp, after all.

And so it was a shock when the Department of Labor’s report showed that more than twice that number — 528,000 —  were added last month.

Indeed, this latest jobs report provides more questions than answers about the state of the U.S. economy: What is the cause of employers’ confidence in hiring if many fear a recession? Why is the job market so resilient if the economy seems to be more depressed? These are apparent contradictions that Federal Reserve officials will weigh as they think about what path to take.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/07/business/the-week-in-business-job-growth.html

In this film, a boy named Charlie (Walker Scobell, “The Adam Project”) deduces that his absent father (Owen Wilson) has been living a double life as the Iron Man-like hero named the Guard. Charlie discovers this after he and his friends stumble upon an underground lair beneath his home; as in “Spy Kids,” the veteran parent soon finds need for junior backup, which the intrepid little kids are all too eager to provide.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/movies/secret-headquarters-review.html

2022-08-11,The Artists Taking on Mass Incarceration,"WHEN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY artist Maria Gaspar was 12 years old, her teachers took her to jail. It was the early 1990s, in the era of Scared Straight programs aimed at curbing juvenile delinquency, and Gaspar and her classmates were deemed “at risk,” by virtue of where they lived — the West Side of Chicago — and who they were, many of them first-generation immigrants from Mexico. Back then, on any given day, Cook County Jail, located in the city’s South Lawndale neighborhood, housed some 8,000 people, a third of them pretrial detainees unable to post bail, mostly men, Black and brown. Gaspar remembers her frightened teachers, all of them white, scurrying through tiered cellblocks; the inedible food served to them in the mess hall; the guards scolding the young visitors for crossing their legs and for “not being ‘clean.’” But her clearest memory is of the faces of those who gazed back at her from their confinement. “I remember feeling like the guys behind bars looked like people down my block,” she says. “They just looked like people I knew.

2022-08-11,A Glossy Rainbow Fireplace From Luca Guadagnino,"There’s an elegant logic to the fact that Luca Guadagnino, the 51-year-old Italian director of films such as “Call Me by Your Name,” runs a design studio. After all, his movies are as much about atmosphere as they are character; to him, objects are also metaphors, whether a marble corridor that stands in for bourgeois restraint or a peach that represents the opposite. His most recent creation, a fireplace, was inspired by its function as the spiritual center of the home. Forgoing traditional materials such as stone and brick, he had Munich’s famed Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory fabricate this vivid pastel-hued ceramic hearth, which can be made in different sizes and palettes (he has one in his own country home in the Piemonte region of Italy). “The difference in working with this material versus, say, marble is that you’re not chipping away to see what emerges — you’re building from nothing,” he says. To Guadagnino, the “brash, glossy” rainbow surfaces suggest a dancing flame, though the fireplace is built to withstand real heat. “There may be a little crackling to the finish,” he says, “but I think that’s beautiful. It’s part of the story.” Studio Luca Guadagnino fireplace, price on request, info@studiolucaguadagnino.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/t-magazine/luca-guadagnino-fireplace.html

The more than 255-carat raspberry-shaped gem, which was made into a pendant with leaves of gold and green enamel, has a peripatetic history: After the 1574 death of its first known owner, Charles IX of France, his wife, Elisabeth, brought it back to her home in Austria. It was later looted by Sweden during the Thirty Years’ War and eventually given as a gift to Catherine the Great. But during an inventory of the Russian collection in 1922, the mineralogist Aleksandr Fersman made a shocking discovery: Caesar’s Ruby was, in fact, a rubellite tourmaline. While classified as semiprecious, such tourmalines, which derive their color from manganese, are actually rarer than rubies. By mixing deep scarlet rubies with tourmalines, which tend to come in shades of tender rose, in a pair of pink gold chandelier earrings, Bulgari, the 138-year-old Rome-based luxury brand, has created an explosion of shimmering coral reds that trace the curve of the neck. Caesar’s Ruby captured the world’s attention with its depth of hue; these earrings refract that legacy in an elegant cascade.

2022-08-15,The Week in Business: Inflation Moderates,"After months of prices that climbed higher and higher without any indication of letting up, last month brought some relief. New inflation data on Wednesday showed the Consumer Price Index rising 8.5 percent in the year through July, a notable slowdown from June, when prices increased 9.1 percent. Falling prices for airfares, used cars, hotel rooms and gas drove the decline, with the national average for a gallon of gasoline descending sharply since earlier in the summer. But the inflation report is not the unqualified good news it may seem at first. A measure that strips out volatile food and fuel costs rose 5.9 percent, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remain strong. Still, the overall moderating pace is likely to be reassuring for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who will see July’s data as a step in the right direction. And it’s a win for President Biden, for whom high inflation is a political liability. What happens next, however, is uncertain: Last year, inflation sped up in the fall after cooling in the summer.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/14/business/the-week-in-business-inflation.html

Now I was convinced I’d missed the whole point. Here, the profiler argued, was a way to depict life as art without demanding more drama than life already provides. There was a startling lack of conventional conflict in the filmmaker’s work, which allowed these films to make plain how intense it is to simply negotiate the boundaries between your inner experience and the world. The journalist’s excitement and admiration for the director’s work drove the piece. The writer was turned on by the director’s perspective; I, in turn, fell in love with this writer for helping me see what she saw.

Mr. Leonti plans to keep the pastas limited to four, seasonal and rotating with choices like smoked lemon cacio e pepe and pici alla nerano. As is his wont, the emphasis will be on bread. “I’ve installed the most incredible bread ovens to bake our breads and pastries,” he said. He’s buying wheat from Pennsylvania and milling it in-house.

In 1969, when his home in Ridgetop, Tenn., caught fire, he raced into the burning house to save two prized possessions, his guitar and a pound of “Colombian grass.” He has emphysema, the consequence of a near-lifetime of chain smoking that began in childhood, when he puffed on cedar bark and grapevines, before turning to cigarettes and then — famously, prodigiously — to marijuana. In 1981, he was taken to a hospital in Hawaii after his left lung collapsed while he was swimming. He underwent a voluntary stem-cell procedure in 2015, in an effort to repair his damaged lungs. Smoking has endangered his life, but it also, he thinks, saved it: He has often said that he would have died long ago had he not taken up weed and laid off drinking, which made him rowdy and self-destructive. Now, in his late 80s, he has reached the age where getting out of bed each morning can be construed as a feat of survival. “Last night I had a dream that I died twice yesterday,” he sang in 2017, “But I woke up still not dead again today.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/magazine/willie-nelson.html

Similarly, Milena Pagán brings her Puerto Rican roots to the menu at Little Sister in Providence, R.I., with jam combinations including guava and raspberry, as well as blood orange and hibiscus. And at Flourish Bakeshop & All Day Café on Long Island, Chelsea Kravitz creates preserves out of butternut squash and other produce from her garden, which add color to her yogurt bowls, cocktails and dukkah-flavored whipped ricotta toast.

Though they will all play important roles in the novel, these characters are so conventionally positioned that they are never even given proper names; they are Mother, Father, Mother’s Younger Brother, Grandfather and a child known only as “the little boy.” The little boy, we are told, has lately developed a fascination with Harry Houdini, although, being too young to frequent vaudeville houses and the like, he has only read obsessively about the world-famous escape artist, never seen him in the flesh. And in the next paragraph, a car — nay, “a black 45-horsepower Pope-Toledo Runabout” — crashes into a telephone pole in front of the little boy’s house, on that sleepy street in out-of-the-way New Rochelle; the unharmed passenger, who then comes to the front door to apologize, is Houdini himself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/t-magazine/ragtime-el-doctorow.html

At first, the young man, subtly veined with craquelure and rendered in cobalt blue on a tin-glazed ceramic Delft tile, appears to have come from the 17th or 18th century, when more than 800 million such tiles, often bearing similar pastoral sketches, were produced in Holland. But on closer inspection, there are differences: This cropper is shirtless, his backside a bit too pert, and the stalks of asparagus growing from the ground are, in fact, penises. Made in 2019 by the 54-year-old British artist Paul Bommer — who has also worked phallic imagery into tiles variously depicting what might be initially mistaken for a kite in ancient China, a prize squash and chickens being fed by an old lady — the provocative scene reflects a larger rediscovery of Delft-style tiles by a new generation of history-upending ceramists.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/t-magazine/delft-tiles.html

The object’s popularity coincided with the return to fashion of the translucent crystal, a fixture of the house’s haute joaillerie innovations of the time. Two decades later, Gloria Swanson — one of the biggest movie stars of the 1920s — purchased a pair of Cartier rock crystal and diamond bracelets. Crafted with an expandable row of carved hemispherical half-disks, the bangles had no clasp, and their monochromatic, oversize bombé shape stood out on the black-and-white screen when she wore them alongside Laurence Olivier in her 1933 film, “Perfect Understanding.” An extravagant woman (she had a 24-room Beverly Hills estate), Swanson adopted the Cartier bracelets as one of her trademarks both on- and offscreen, wearing them in publicity stills and at awards ceremonies. Later, she incorporated them into her wardrobe when she made her comeback in 1950 as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/t-magazine/cartier-watch-gloria-swanson.html

But the roses are not real. Rather, they’re high-quality artificial ones, the better to keep their fresh look into October when the outdoor patio will remain open under heat lamps and with a translucent overhead covering. Seating 25 and owned by the Sapir Corp. Ltd., the restaurant is open from 4 to 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, welcoming those who might sip a cocktail and nibble small plates of food. It has its own menu, distinct from that of NoMo Kitchen in the hotel, but the same chef, Evan Bergman, who worked with the Charlie Palmer Group. Though brief, the menu voyages far and wide: burrata with heirloom tomatoes and melon, octopus carpaccio, eggplant nigiri with miso and a sesame-scallion dressing, duck wings with gochujang glaze and lamb kofte with harissa labneh. Most of the custom cocktails, offered in addition to classics, emphasize fruit.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Instead, Johnson set out on a different course, creating collages, mail art sent through the postal service and exploring photography — but not as a high-end “art photographer” or darkroom practitioner. Johnson was fascinated by vernacular photography. He copied photographs from magazines, used disposable cameras and treated photo booths as ad hoc art studios. In the end, he left behind about 3,000 color photographs, many made in the last three years of his life and virtually unexamined for three decades. Dozens are on view in the terrific, densely packed exhibition “Please Send to Real Life: Ray Johnson Photographs” at the Morgan Library & Museum.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/arts/design/ray-johnson-photography-morgan-library.html

This book has a lot of the things I’ve always loved about his writing. It’s a hilarious, peculiar and very touching story about a deaf, blind Jehovah’s Witness boy and his gay interpreter (Blair has been a “terp” for 30 years!) who try to find the boy’s long-lost love together. It gets very dramatic! Next up are Airea D. Matthews’s “Simulacra,” Peter Rock’s “Passersthrough,” a couple of Rough Guide travel books and The Anarchist Review of Books.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/books/review/james-hannaham-by-the-book-interview.html
