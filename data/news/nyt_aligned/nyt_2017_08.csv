I am pro-choice and not attached to what has begun to grow inside me. I had hoped to fall in love with a man and have a child with him, but I am well aware that I’m running out of time. While I’m apparently quite fertile, as time goes on the odds of getting pregnant get tougher, and there are enormous costs in egg freezing and/or I.V.F. For these reasons, I’m leaning heavily toward having the baby. My boyfriend is disturbed, angry and upset that I would have his baby ‘‘against his will,’’ as he put it. The point being, I think, that I can find another guy or get inseminated, so it’s not fair to have his baby because of my biological-clock concerns. I’ve read a lot about the ethics of expecting him to be involved or pay for support if he doesn’t want the child but not about whether it’s O.K. to choose to have the child at all.

Each was recently at the center of a roiling controversy about what it means for white artists to make work about black people’s suffering. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss., the creators of “Game of Thrones,” recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called “Confederate,” which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the show’s cancellation. “Detroit,” a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: “No. However, I’m able to tell this story.” Earlier this year, “Open Casket,” an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial. And now protesters are calling for the I.C.A. in Boston to cancel a retrospective of Schutz’s work. Questions of who can tell stories about blackness, and specifically, black history and black pain, are being asked all over the place this summer, and we wanted to ask them, too.",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/podcasts/confederate-detroit-and-who-owns-stories-about-blackness.html

Based — loosely seems altogether too generous a word — on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot’em-up.

These age-­old, songlike wailing traditions are found worldwide — one ethnomusicologist studying in Egypt has noted that modern mourners raise their clenched fists skyward in the exact posture depicted in ancient tomb paintings — but they’re disappearing from most places. Not so in Finland, where an organization that Wilce studies runs instructional workshops on lamenting as the Karelian people of the region have done for centuries. These three-day classes add a modern twist: Rather than being performed solely at a wake (by what Finns call a ‘‘cry woman’’), impromptu requiems are devoted to all manner of emotional hardship, from divorce to illness.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/magazine/how-to-lament.html

2017-08-04,"A Final Mystery for Amelia Peabody, Egyptologist and Sleuth","LAST HURRAH: When the mystery writer Barbara Mertz died, in 2013, she left behind an unfinished manuscript in her long-running series about the early-20th-century Egyptologist and amateur sleuth Amelia Peabody. Mertz (who wrote the series under the name Elizabeth Peters) was herself an accomplished Egyptologist, with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and she often based her novels on actual episodes from the discipline’s colorful history — as in the new book, “The Painted Queen,” about the discovery and theft of a priceless bust of Nefertiti. But she hadn’t made much progress when she fell ill, and was still working out details of the plot with occasional help from her friend and fellow novelist Joan Hess. So her estate, naturally enough, asked Hess if she would finish the book that Mertz had started. “My first response was an adamant refusal,” Hess writes in a preface to “The Painted Queen,” new at No. 7 on the hardcover fiction list. “The idea of attempting to capture her voice, her erudite style, her wit and her vast knowledge of archaeology in the early 20th century seemed ludicrous. I lost that one, obviously.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/books/review/amelia-peabody-barbara-mertz-joan-hess.html

The series begins with “Something Wild” (Friday), in which a free spirit played by Melanie Griffith takes Jeff Daniels’s “closet rebel” banker for a whirl. The filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson will participate in a Q. and A. after the 7 p.m. screening; on Saturday he will speak before the 4:20 p.m. showing of “Melvin and Howard” — Howard being Howard Hughes (Jason Robards), and Melvin being the luckless Everyman (Paul Le Mat) who befriends him. This near-comprehensive program, continuing through Aug. 24, has untold riches, but the most underrated may be “The Truth About Charlie” (Wednesday), a remake of Stanley Donen’s “Charade” and a loving homage to the French New Wave.

This 4,800-square-foot Brooklyn restaurant is the first of several projects for which Ms. Brefere is the culinary director. A sleek, modernized brasserie with an open kitchen and seats for 120, it also has a separate retail bakery and cafe. The company’s executive chef, Rostislav Kemelman, who worked at restaurants owned by Bobby Flay, April Bloomfield and Shelly Fireman, relies on local purveyors whenever possible, and the restaurant proudly lists more than a dozen. The menu includes dishes like bouillabaisse, pot-au-feu, salmon choucroute and French onion soup. Lighter fare, like a croque-monsieur and various tartines, will also be served. In the fall, there will be a bigger KarVér (pronounced kar-VAIR) opening in Chelsea, and another in Downtown Brooklyn. Ms. Brefere said the location for the company’s first restaurant was chosen because many of the investors were Russian-Americans with roots in the neighborhood. “It also makes for a good testing ground for the launch before we go into Manhattan,” she said.

2017-08-09,How Do I Deal With a Gun at a Relative’s Home?,"The patriarch of our large family came out of the closet as an elderly man nearing the end of his life; he now has a husband who is much younger, whom I will call Tim. The family embraced Tim, but the adjustment has been rocky, especially among some of the men. Tim has earned back this trust by being both husband and physical caretaker of our ailing relative. One recent evening, while his husband was ill, Tim and I sat alone in their home. The conversation turned to gun politics; I’m a closeted gun rights sympathizer. Perhaps sensing some undue camaraderie, Tim stole away to the foyer, then returned with an unloaded black shotgun and ammunition. Tim told me not to mention this to our family — or to my relative, who doesn’t know about the shotgun even though they live together. We also have children in the family, who visit Tim and his husband with frequency, and I’m well aware of the statistics about households that keep guns. I plan to advise Tim at least to move the gun elsewhere, out of the house. However, that does not seem to be enough. Having the gun in the house suggests a lack of judgment; it seems like a serious breach of trust and, God forbid, potentially dangerous. Doesn’t this directly contravene Tim’s claim to being a responsible caretaker, an ethical impetus that overrides confidentiality? Another twist: I also know that if the gun (or ammunition) were discovered, it could be just the excuse our extremely anti-gun family needs to disavow Tim. This seems like a bitter pileup of issues — gay equality, gun safety and family loyalty.

2017-08-09,What a Fraternity Hazing Death Revealed About the Painful Search for an Asian-American Identity,"Pocono Pines, Pa., is a two-hour drive from New York City. After you exit the Interstate, the route into town winds past short trees and abandoned gas stations with rust-­edged signs showing gas prices from years before. The town, on the shore of Lake Naomi, once serviced the traffic to Mount Airy Lodge, a nearby resort that featured honeymoon suites with heart-­shaped tubs in the bathrooms that closed in 2001 after years of neglect; in 2007 the Mount Airy Casino opened on the same site. The local courthouse is on the second floor of a rundown building, above Elite Nails and Spa. There are no government markings out front, no scales of justice, nothing to distinguish it from the generic commercial properties that line Pennsylvania Route 940. The directions given out by the Monroe County courts tell you to look for an ice-cream stand with a sign shaped like a cone.

Inside, the house was an oasis of calm and carefully considered details, orchestrated by her mother, the renowned English antiques dealer Hilary Batstone. It is from these surroundings that the London-based Uniacke, now a mother of five, developed the sumptuous but restrained look that characterizes interiors for clients such as Jo Malone and David and Victoria Beckham. While living near Toulouse in the ’90s, Uniacke began collecting pieces from flea markets across France. A decade later, she opened a shop on the design-boutique-rich Pimlico Road, which has become a pilgrimage site for local and visiting aesthetes. Sparingly appointed with Regency chairs and Art Nouveau sconces — as well as simpler pieces, including a giant copper planter designed by Uniacke and stocked with firewood — it also carries her own line of furniture and her newly launched fabric collection, which, as one might expect, is exactly what you need for modern country life: supple linens from the U.K. and mohair velvets in earth and jewel tones — and nothing more.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/t-magazine/design/rose-uniacke-profile-style.html

Part performance, part social gathering, the festivals draw thousands of kites, which are choreographed into dances, fights and competitions. “But this is not what calls me,” Gall says. “What spoke to me was the transformation of the ordinary into the extraordinary. The cartoonish kites become planetary forces orbiting; the sky becomes a vast sea full of creatures.” Here, some of the celestial bodies she encountered.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/t-magazine/art/pictures-from-kite-festivals-denmark-long-beach.html

There is no dialogue, characters or discernible locations, nor any real context to clarify what happens. In one scene a man walks into a gas station and blasts away the attendant. In another a different man follows someone in a parking lot and shoots him after he gets into his car; the assailant walks away unconcernedly. This goes on and on, the executions various and relentless, until the 39-minute film ends.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/the-in-your-face-films-of-alan-clarke.html

Though André Courrèges introduced body-conscious pantsuits in ’64, and Yves Saint Laurent his Le Smoking two years later, skirts remained standard until women began to discover, in the words of Margaret Thatcher’s stylist, that ‘‘she was in a man’s world, and she had to look the part.’’ And so was born the female power suit. Wide-cut, concealing and double-breasted, the suits, by designers like Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana, had oversize shoulder pads, which served as both a bulking agent and an armor, and were styled with minimal concessions to femininity. Makeup looked more like war paint than ornament, and hair was teased out — hopeful intimidation-tactic chic.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/t-magazine/fashion/fall-runway-power-dressing.html

That way, the therapeutic calm instilled by the glorious Iberian scenery (photographed by James Clarke in shimmering, almost edible pastels) could be savored uninterrupted by the performative patter of the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.

As W. F., an alcoholic author with a mysterious connection to the movie’s nebbishy hero, Thomas (Callum Turner), Mr. Bridges slips delightedly into the kind of arrogant-artist role he perfected in “The Door in the Floor” (2004).

2017-08-11,"Attacked on All Sides, an Anti-Trump Manifesto Prevails on the Best-Seller List","FLAKE NEWS: Quick, who wrote “Inferno”? (A) Dante. (B) Dan Brown. (C) All of the above. The right answer is of course (C), and thanks to Brown — I like to picture him introducing himself at cocktail parties as “Dante Brown” — there is recent precedent for borrowing a classic’s title in hopes that its posterity might rub off. (It worked for Brown. His Dante-influenced thriller spent more than a year on the hardcover and paperback fiction lists.) Even so, the Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has raised eyebrows by calling his new anti-Trump manifesto “Conscience of a Conservative.” That’s because Barry Goldwater’s 1960 book of that title, which stayed on the Times nonfiction list for 31 weeks, is still revered as a founding document of the modern conservative movement. Right-wing commentators who aren’t as ready to abandon the president see Flake’s appropriation of the name more as apostasy than as the homage Flake intended, and object to the book’s attacks on the Republican establishment. (“We pretended that the emperor wasn’t naked,” Flake writes. “Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.”) Brent Bozell III, president of the conservative Media Research Center and son of Goldwater’s collaborator (some say ghostwriter), recently insisted that “Jeff Flake is not a conservative, nor does he have a conscience,” and he called on his “conservative brethren to denounce this impostor.” You know you’re in trouble when your critics are using the word “brethren.” Not that liberals are much happier. In The New Republic this month, Alex Shephard applauded the book’s message but said that Flake — who “has voted with Donald Trump 95 percent of the time” — was the wrong person to deliver it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/books/review/jeff-flake-conscience-conservative.html

When the curators told her that the piece, which was designed to lie flat on the ground, was going to be positioned half on and half off a ramp, Benglis pulled out of the exhibition. Recently, I asked her why she had begun making these flat sculptures. ‘‘When you see a curve and when you see things that flow on the floor, you physically feel them in a gravitational way,’’ she said.

The commission combed through a long history of protected information, concerning everything from bomb tests to Communist infiltration, before calling for a vast reduction in the amount of federal information deemed ‘‘classified.’’ Moynihan hoped that the end of the Cold War had made Washington’s pernicious ‘‘culture of secrecy’’ obsolete. But history did not go his way.

Its admirers were surprised and delighted when it transferred to the big time last November — at the Imperial Theater — without shedding a spark of its extravagant individuality, and it picked up 12 Tony nominations, the most of any show that season. The reasons for its premature demise are complicated and unpleasant. Instead of revisiting them, make a point of seeing — or-re-seeing — a one-of-a-kind triumph of the imagination.

As Hodgman recalls in his introduction to Campbell’s sequel, “Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor,” when a book editor finally bit, he was taking a gamble based on what Campbell had shown everybody: “You can cultivate a good and profitable artistic career by knowing your audience and keeping them close,” Hodgman writes. “Soon we would all have to do that, because mass monoculture was largely not going to exist anymore.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/books/review/bruce-campbell-autobiography-if-chins-could-kill.html

They responded, saying that I should not speak with him “until investigations are complete.” That was a year ago. Now, I cannot ask the super for services, while other shareholders can.

This was the kind of book I aspired to write.” Atlas went on to become a publisher, editor and the author of biographies of Saul Bellow and the poet Delmore Schwartz. His new book is about the art of biography: how Atlas came to love it; how it’s been practiced through the ages; the magic it can work and its shortcomings.

As an adventure photographer, he has since accompanied the climber Ed Viesturs and the filmmaker David Breashears to the top of Mount Everest, trekked unsupported across 300 miles of the Chang Tang Plateau in Tibet and was a member of the first American team to ski down from the top of Everest. His work has been published in National Geographic and The New York Times Magazine, and his film “Meru,” documenting his pioneering ascent up Meru Peak in the Himalayas with two other climbers, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015. He counts landscape paintings from the Song dynasty in China and Chinese calligraphy, which he says is “about balance and use of space,” among his artistic influences in capturing vast landscapes, often with a person in them for context.

His secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, had become convinced that the war was unwinnable and urged the president to announce a bombing halt to coax North Vietnam into negotiations. But the generals on the Joint Chiefs of Staff pushed back — the war was winnable, they insisted, if only the president would double down on bombing, mine the North’s main port of Haiphong harbor and add 200,000 men to the ranks, most of them destined for Vietnam.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/opinion/lyndon-johnson-vietnam-senate.html

The move was unexpected, as Cernovich had carved out a comfortable niche for himself — railing against coastal elites and feminism, peddling conspiracy theories and self-help books. But Cernovich appeared to have decided that it was ‘‘bad for business’’ to, for example, keep pushing rumors of pedophilia in the Democratic leadership.

2017-08-29,Why Are Some New Statistics Embraced and Not Others?,"For the casual, uninitiated baseball fan who tunes in every once in a while, this season’s home-run calls must sound as baffling as a Pentecostal sermon to an unbeliever. A baseball broadcast is, as much as anything, a string of synonyms in a familiar, comforting cadence. Words like ‘‘dinger,’’ ‘‘laser’’ and ‘‘punchado’’ take years to embed themselves into the game’s collective vocabulary, and there’s a graveyard full of home-run and strikeout calls that failed to do so or have fallen out of fashion. (My favorite among the dead: the understated yet effective ‘‘tater’’ for a home run.) Statistics have an even harder time gaining mainstream acceptance, so it must be strange for a newbie to tune in to a Yankees game this year and see Aaron Judge, baseball’s largest son, hit a towering shot into the bleachers and hear the commentator say something like, ‘‘Wow, that ball traveled out of here with an exit velocity of 115.3 miles per hour!’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/why-are-some-new-statistics-embraced-and-not-others.html

First elected in 1982, Schultz placed himself within the progressive tradition that made Wisconsin, a century ago, the birthplace of the state income tax and laws that guarantee compensation for injured workers. In the months before his visit to Michael Best, Schultz cast the lone Republican vote against a bill that stripped collective-­bargaining rights from most public employees. But if Schultz had doubts about some of his party’s priorities, he welcomed its ascendance to power. For the first time in his career, Republicans controlled the State Senate and the State Assembly as well as the governor’s office, giving them total sway over the redistricting process that follows the census taken at the beginning of each decade. ‘‘The way I saw it, reapportionment is a moment of opportunity for the ruling party,’’ Schultz told me this summer.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html

The space is filled with computers: Against one wall, an assistant writes code while another researches data used to train artificial intelligence. Opposite is a long credenza filled with art monographs and topped by a slightly sinister collection of objets: a Dungeons & Dragons-style dragon trophy with a shield and saber; a toy model of the stealth submarine U.S.S.

Famous for its fly-fishing, it was once home to a number of 19th-century outdoors clubs (some of which still exist today) on the Beaverkill, a trout-stocked tributary of the Delaware. Later, an absence of trains linking Sullivan County to Manhattan, along with a lack of sophisticated hotels and restaurants, preserved the area’s untrammeled remoteness, leaving it largely underdeveloped and undervisited.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/t-magazine/travel/sullivan-county-narrowsburg-livingston-manor-callicoon-guide.html

We didn’t talk much because we were focused on our food, but when we did, it was about the mysteries of the delicious. A chicken-fried steak is nothing to champion, after all, at least on its face. It’s just cheap beef pounded thin, dressed in seasoned flour and fried, an Americanized taste of the schnitzel brought to Texas by German immigrants in the 19th century. Peppery cream gravy generally accompanies the steak. That gravy can be gummy when it’s not prepared well. And the steak beneath it can be dry, or soggy, or both. Ours was neither. Walsh and I marveled at the way the texture of the meat’s crisp exterior was heightened by the silkiness of the gravy, at the way sweet and salty combined in the dish and at the manner in which the whole experience was so much greater than the parts. Soon enough I went home to recreate the meal.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/magazine/for-chicken-fried-steak-too-much-is-just-enough.html

Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack.
