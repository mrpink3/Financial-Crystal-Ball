Depending on the game, they exhort players to hop, wriggle, serve and volley, left-hook a virtual boxing opponent or, in some other fashion, move.

2010-12-01,Seeing the Light,"For those of you who have considered hoarding incandescent light bulbs before they’re phased out for good in 2014, you might want to hold off on renting that storage space. General Electric’s Energy Smart LED bulb goes on sale on Wednesday on the company’s Web site. The nine-watt bulb is not only energy-efficient — it produces the same amount of light as a 40-watt incandescent bulb (higher-wattage models are in the works) with 77 percent less power — but is also omnidirectional, unlike earlier generations of LED bulbs, which shed light in one direction only. Its 22,500-hour life span is twice that of a compact fluorescent bulb, and it contains no mercury. GE claims that one bulb will last 22.8 years, and GE’s  Energy Smart microsite, designed by the New York firm Doyle Partners, makes the point by following a girl from infancy to her wedding day, with the same light illuminating each scene. The bulb’s $50 price tag may give sticker shock to all but early adopters. But considering its long life and its incandescent-quality white light — not to mention GE’s assertion that if every American household bought just one, we’d save almost $400 million in energy costs and prevent five billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions in one year — the bulb could turn out to be a good investment in more ways than one.

And sure enough, he was different.Instead of reviewing brief summaries of the bank’s operations, as his predecessor had, Dimon demanded to see the raw data — hundreds of pages detailing J. P. Morgan’s businesses every month. Instead of simply trusting his traders, Dimon put himself through a tutorial, so that he would understand the complex trades the bank was exposed to. And rather than run its mortgage machine at full throttle for as long as possible, Dimon reined in lending earlier than did others and warned his shareholders of looming trouble.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/magazine/05Dimon-t.html

It was an hour before Guo Pei and her husband, Cao Bao Jie, reached the headquarters of Rose Studio, their fashion company, on the city’s north side. The October sun was blazing pale when their Mercedes pulled up to a low-rise office complex, its white brick rendered shabby by newer developments. Cao, a stocky, good-looking Taiwanese man who goes by the name Jack, had been kneeling the whole time next to the driver; facing his wife, who sat in the back; and translating from Chinese into English. Now he sort of backed out of the car. Guo Pei, whose career as a fashion designer began when there was no fashion in her country, remained a study in Asian poise and etiquette. In addition to large eyes and delicate features, enhanced by careful makeup, she has a gentleness unmarred by circumstance. These circumstances include wealth and a list of clients in Beijing’s highest political, media and social circles. But as Jack said proudly, ‘‘Guo Pei is a very traditional lady — a wonderful wife and daughter and mother who always cares more about her family than the attention she receives.’’",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/year-of-the-couturiere/

Despite the name, the concept behind their latest venture is anything but primitive, including references to the revolutionary 17th-century mathematician Johannes Kepler and a special app the duo devised to generate different formations. But the end results are beautiful sculptural pieces that fulfill both a function (in this case, mostly seating) and offer the possibility of being developed into a full-fledged architectural system.

I wondered: What do these people want, sprinters imported from Jamaica to move the chains? Next, a Washington defensive player limped to the sideline with an apparent knee injury, and the boos came cascading down again inside Oregon’s concrete bowl of a stadium. “They think he’s faking it so the defense can get rest,” my friend from the bands explained. “That’s been happening to us a lot.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/magazine/05Football-t.html

2010-12-03,Scanners Gone Wild," Over the past three and a half years, the advancing army of Google Street View cars has pressed forward, its units opening fire on city after city from roof-mounted, omnidirectional cameras that seize, in an unyielding digital grip, panoramic images — of Rome! of Peoria! of Antarctica! — that Google’s commanders stockpile and post online. Protests have followed dependably, and often literally, in their path. In spring of 2009, residents of Broughton, a hamlet in southeast England, took to the streets and surrounded a lone, unmarked Google car with its conspicuous periscope camera, the crowd swiftly herding the intruder out of their neighborhood. Later that year, in Bergen, Norway, two people dressed in full-body scuba suits — in goggles, snorkels and flippers — ran up a road after a Google car, each of the anonymous amphibians brandishing a pitchfork. And this past May, shortly after Google admitted that its cars weren’t just taking pictures — they had “inadvertently” gathered information, including e-mail passwords, from unprotected WiFi networks (“We screwed up,” Sergey Brin, one of Google’s founders, said) — 30 European countries banded together to combat Google’s infringements on the privacy of citizens. The nations demanded improvements in Google’s blurring techniques (designed to obscure faces, license plates, naked people) and sought a reduction, from 12 to 6, in the number of months Google could hold onto the millions of unblurred original images backed up on its servers. Individual European countries began investigations as well, securing exemptions to protect their citizens, with more than 240,000 Germans opting out of Street View in advance of it going live last month — an option that Google agreed to only in Germany (where, among other things, Stasi surveillance isn’t yet a hazy memory). And last year Greece went so far as to ban Google’s Street View vehicles from operating within their borders, pending further investigation.

How can you resolve this with the person who, for example, was unable in an interview to name a single newspaper or magazine she read, either because she doesn’t read them or simply couldn’t think of the right answer when the camera was on? Draper also suggests that the prevailing narrative of Palin is of a “social-media visionary.” Using Facebook and Twitter doesn’t set her apart — what does is that the media follow her with rapt attention and present it as the other side of a never-ending argument between right and left, regardless of her importance to the political process.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/magazine/05letters-t-THEROGUEROOM_LETTERS.html

2010-12-03,Holiday Books: Movies,"No Marx Brothers movie exemplifies the divine anarchy of Julius, Leonard, Arthur and Herbert Marx as purely as the 1933 Paramount comedy “Duck Soup.” It was the last film in which all four brothers — stage-named Groucho, Chico, Harpo and Zeppo — appeared together on-screen. Unlike their earlier Paramount films (or those that would come after their move to MGM the following year), “Duck Soup” is devoid of romantic subplots or, for that matter, of any real plotline at all, save for the foundering of the bankrupt kingdom of Freedonia in a senseless, and quite conceivably endless, Groucho-led war. Yet “Duck Soup” is the film Harold Bloom, in an essay on “the 20th-century American sublime,” called one of the great works of art of the past century. It’s one of the movies T. S. Eliot wanted to discuss when he met with Groucho in 1964 (Groucho had hoped to chat about “Murder in the Cathedral”), and the one that inspired Woody Allen’s character in “Hannah and Her Sisters” not to go home and shoot himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Stevens-t.html

From his youthful days as a surveyor through his long military career to his defense of America’s post-­Revolutionary territorial claims, Washington relied on maps.

Apparently, the tyranny of standardized testing has stoked anxiety among some parents, who feel they must press chapter books on their offspring at increasingly younger ages, thus diminishing the market for picture books and causing publishers to prune their lists accordingly. Educators, parents, publishers: what are you thinking? Words are nice, but pictures are sublime. Picture books provide a portal not only to the love of literature, but to limber, limbic terrain — rich with ­sensory-emotional connections and lying, crucially, beyond the reach of language (not to mention beyond the reach of quantitative assessment).

In its shallow drawer I kept a prism that made rainbows, . . . the face of my father’s old Timex and a sample vial of Patou’s Joy.” Her grown-up version is a cabinet of curiosities — in book form — inspired in part by the encyclopedias of the Renaissance, which brimmed with exotic artifacts.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Koppel-t.html

Roaming across the dec­ades in A BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE TO THE GREAT JAZZ AND POP SINGERS (Pantheon, $45) — he started out with David Thomson’s “Biographical Dictionary of Film” as his model — he spins off intelligent portraits that begin alphabetically with Ernestine Anderson (“who is never less than subtle, whether belting the blues or tearing up a torch tune”) and conclude on Page 539 as the curtain falls on Nancy Wilson. At that point, Friedwald shifts to a series of search-and-inform essays on assorted themes that crisscross generations, idioms, performing styles, rec­ord labels, the entertainment industry’s evolution and a galaxy of careers, from Marlene Dietrich to Bob Dylan and Harry Connick Jr. Mahalia Jackson appears in a coda, as the author, wisely, genuflects to gospel music as a popular form.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Berry-t.html

Don’t writers ever consider the possibility that lists stop the action, that they get in the way of the story? Of course not, writers don’t care about our comfort level, they just like to show off how much they know and their ability to communicate it. If I were to draw up a list of all the poets and novelists who have resorted to lists, you’d be astonished.

She’s a Barbary macaque who goes by the name Pompeii, and she’s just set off a bomb at a California university. “Duncan the Wonder Dog” tweaks the old song into a provocative new question: What if we could walk with the animals, talk with the animals — and the animals fought back?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Kois-t.html

Served to a dozen celebrity guests — one course every 20 minutes, requiring more than 40 recipes — the feast would be filmed as a public television special. The result, chronicled in FANNIE’S LAST SUPPER: Re-Creating One Amazing Meal From Fannie Farmer’s 1896 Cookbook (Hyperion, $25.99), makes Julie Powell’s feat of cooking one recipe a day from “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” in “Julie & Julia” look like Child’s play.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Drzal-t.html

On the one hand, the skies over the City of Light too often provide anything but. (It’s not for nothing that Baudelaire, the self-described “king of a rainy land,” dwelled obsessively on his hometown’s “great gray sky,” “foggy seasons,” “drenched landscape” and “mists and rains.”) On the other hand, the city’s mists and rains can clear at the drop of a chapeau.

The local language sprouted from the literal and cultural landscape that informed it — its racial history and disappearing farms, the coexistence of deer festivals and meth busts, the households where people wore Carhartts without irony and put “Queer Eye” on TiVo.

A centenary on Friday  that of the world premiere of Puccini’s “Fanciulla del West” at the Metropolitan Opera, to be commemorated there with the second performance of a revival of Giancarlo del Monaco’s 1992 production starring Deborah Voigt and Marcello Giordani  is a milestone well worth contemplating, as it recalls not just the birth of a great opera but a sort of coming of age of opera in America.

The prize was awarded to a Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, in early October. China is also preventing Mr. Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, from leaving the country to collect the prize. On Thursday, Mr. Ai was catching a flight to Seoul, South Korea, and Mr. Mao was going to Singapore. Both were stopped in the Beijing airport and told by the authorities that they could not travel because they might “endanger state security.” Mr. Ai said in a Twitter message that he had not intended to go to the Nobel ceremony but that he was instead traveling on a matter related to his art.

Well, on Saturday, none of that will matter. The equation will be much simpler for most teams: win a game and win a title. Oregon is an exception. If the Ducks beat Oregon State in the rivalry known as the Civil War, then they will merely secure a chance to win a title. Of course, it will be the B.C.S. championship. Auburn is hoping to join Oregon in that game, but first the Tigers will have to beat South Carolina and win the Southeastern Conference. Florida State and Virginia Tech, two teams that have improved as the season has gone on, will fight it out for the A.C.C. title, while the old foes Oklahoma and Nebraska will meet for one last time as members of the same conference, a fitting end to the Cornhuskers’ time in the Big 12. Connecticut will be looking to wrap up the most improbable B.C.S. berth in the country. If the Huskies beat South Florida, they will be Big East champions.

2010-12-06,Full House,"Down by the Hudson in an old Manhattan pickle factory lives a widow surrounded by a tyrant’s ransom in broken violins. Armand Fernandez, known as Arman since the day a printer left the “D” off his name in a catalog, was a founding member of the midcentury French New Realists and one of the giants of 20th-century art. His medium was objects and his process a focused attack that he called “the pinnacle of a catharsis.” His friend, the painter Yves Klein, told him when they were young, “I’ll take what’s organic, you take what’s manufactured.” Klein invented his iconic International Klein Blue and died young; Arman squared off in violent yet precise acts against violins and guitars, shower hoses, sofas, paint tubes, bicycles, motorcycles, cars and statues, which he smashed, flattened, burned, sawed in half, cast in bronze and sliced, or sank into Perspex or concrete. His 1961 manifesto was titled “The Realism of Accumulations,” and when he wasn’t destroying to create, he made harmonic sequences, set on wooden panels, of musical instruments (whole or chopped), watch faces, trumpets, ladles, gas masks, typewriters, saws and paintbrushes. An Arman retrospective, at the Pompidou Center in Paris through Jan. 10, gives some idea of his range, output and influence on artists as diverse as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, but it cannot, for practical reasons, include his 106-foot-high “Hope for Peace,” a concrete tower in Beirut, Lebanon, in which he buried 78 tanks, jeeps and various pieces of artillery.

2010-12-06,The Gift of Reconciliation,"As the ocean liner steamed in from the open sea and approached the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the boy worried that the ship’s superstructure would not clear. ‘‘It was a cold, sunny winter day, Wednesday, the 22nd of December, 1965,’’ he said. ‘‘There are certain dates etched in your memory.’’ His journey to America had begun in Egypt, where his father was a leading religious figure. ‘‘The image of the Statue of Liberty came into view slowly . . . such majesty and beauty. It was a life-changing moment in my life. I was 17 years old.’’ That Feisal Abdul Rauf’s American story began off the southern tip of Manhattan can seem foreordained, in light of the controversy that consumed him 45 years later. At his first glimpse of his new world, he told me, ‘‘I had an intuition that my work would involve introducing Islam to America.’’ Yet at that point, young Rauf was himself in the throes of typical adolescent questioning. ‘‘In such a free society — it was the ’60s! — religion had become a matter of choice.’’ Not so in Kuwait, where he was born, and where religion was inherited. In America, ‘‘religion was passé. I was bewildered by all that. I was asking, ‘Does God exist? What is the meaning of life?’ And I found the answers to my religious questions as a matter of choice. I could choose to embrace my Muslim faith — and I did.’’ That simply, Feisal Abdul Rauf glimpsed the meaning of the nation’s defining freedom. ‘‘America made it possible for me to freely and deliberately choose to be religious and Muslim.’’ Rauf would become an American citizen in 1979.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/the-gift-of-reconciliation/

2010-12-06,The New Wave,"Naomi Campbell’s been accused of many things, but crimes against hair? The beehive she sported on the stand at the United Nations war-crimes trial of Charles Taylor at The Hague last summer garnered a lot of buzz, but the buzz was tinged with ridicule — a clear indication that while the style possessed a lot of pins, it didn’t have real legs. The staid, sculptured bumps of hair looked painfully anachronistic, and just like that, a trend that seemed fresh on Prada’s fall runway came tumbling down. ‘‘For all the talk of the beehive this fall, no one’s really wearing it,’’ says Orlando Pita, who created the edgy style on the previous page. ‘‘The big editorial up-do doesn’t translate into real life.’’ Accordingly, at the spring shows, hair started to come undone. There were long, partial plaits at Givenchy, sex-kitten tousles at Isabel Marant and half-up-half-down dos at Miu Miu and Christopher Kane, while the rocker chicks at Balmain looked like they had just rolled out of bed. For Pita, the new down-do is all about texture. ‘‘We’ve seen perfectly blown out, silicone-sleek hair for so long,’’ he says. ‘‘The new texture doesn’t look so worked on. It’s all in the brushing and the products you use.’’ Pita sprays Elevate, a texturizer from his own line, into wet hair and dries it using his fingers to encourage the natural wave. (Everyone has one.) Next, he sprays dry shampoo (his version is called Refresh) onto the roots (avoiding the top of the head) in one-inch sections. Finally, he gently brushes it out with a Mason Pearson brush, fluffing the hair so ‘‘it feels soft, not tacky with product. I call it the anti-blow dry.’’",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/the-new-wave/

The Berbers’ endowment covers all of Glimmer’s operating costs, which has allowed the foundation to spend $40 million and counting to help alleviate poverty in Ethiopia. “One hundred percent of the money, not 50 or 80 percent, needed to get to the people,” says Philip, comparing Glimmer’s business model with that of other charities. “We had to start with a clean piece of paper.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/capitalist-crusaders/

The only sizable new release, “The Warrior’s Way,” a Relativity Media western designed as a vehicle for the South Korean superstar Jang Dong-gun, flopped badly with just $3 million in ticket sales. Most notable for the weekend was a film that opened in only 18 theaters: Darren Aronofsky’s “Black Swan,” a dark portrait of a ballet dancer (Natalie Portman), grossed $1.4 million for a per-theater average of $77,459  one of the best art-house results for the year and a record for the studio behind the film, Fox Searchlight. Over all “Tangled” (Walt Disney Studios), above, was No. 1 in its second weekend in theaters, selling $21.5 million for a new total of $96.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” (Warner Brothers) was second with $16.7 million for a three-week total of more than $244 million. The runaway-train thriller “Unstoppable” (20th Century Fox) lived up to its title, tying for third in its fourth week with about $6.1 million for a new total of $69 million. The musical “Burlesque” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) shared third-place ranking with $6.1 million of its own for a two-week total of $29 million. “Love and Other Drugs” (Fox) rounded out the top five with $5.7 million for a two-week total of $22.6 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/movies/06arts-ASLOWWEEKEND_BRF.html

Proceeds from the performance will go toward renovating the school’s original building at 111 Second Avenue, near Seventh Street in the East Village, also known as Central Plaza. It was there that Mr. Crystal’s father, Jack, produced “The Sessions” jazz concerts on Friday and Saturday nights from the late 1940s through the early ’60s. In a telephone interview on Sunday, Mr. Crystal, right, emphasized the legacy of jazz, particularly Dixieland, that his father helped preserve there at a time when rock ’n’ roll was beginning to permeate the music scene. He also talked about his own ties to the building, referring to a “world of these amazing musicians, their spirit, their sense of humor” that, he said, first inspired him as a child to take the stage to tap-dance. But it was watching his father as the master of ceremonies that had the most profound effect on him. “He was up onstage with a microphone, and I guess I wanted to do what he did,” he said.  Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams will be among those paying tribute to Mr. Crystal at the gala, at Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Frederick P. Rose Hall.

The list of finalists, from the International Animated Film Society, is sure to have some overlap with the little gold man race, especially this year, when the Academy can nominate only three films (out of 15 submitted for eligibility). “Toy Story 3″ is a lock, of course, but may also wind up in the best picture category, as “Up” did last year. “Tangled” performed well at the box office against stiff competition, which could help its chances. “How to Train Your Dragon” might be a good bet for the final spot, but don’t double-down yet. Last year, Annie voters gave a nomination to the little-seen Irish film “The Secret of Kells,” and it went on to secure an Oscar slot.

A victim of female genital mutilation, the 13-year-old Dirie escaped an arranged marriage in Somalia and made it to London in the 1980s, where she worked at McDonald’s before being discovered by Terence Donovan. Kebede, 32, grew up in Ethiopia and was discovered by a filmmaker at the French lycée in Addis Ababa. In a recent interview, she was quick to draw a distinction between her own life story and Dirie’s. “On the surface we have parallels,” she said, before explaining how different life seemed in Djibouti, a neighboring country to Somalia, where parts of the film were shot. “This is where she came from. There’s nothing there, there’s no water, there’s nothing. And being in that environment was a new thing for me, and then trying to understand how you go from that to become this incredible woman — [Dirie] was never really a victim of her circumstances.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/flower-power-liya-kebede-as-waris-dirie/

2010-12-07,Scottish Artist Wins Turner Prize for a Recording,"Susan Philipsz, a 45-year-old Scottish artist, has won this year’s Turner Prize, The Guardian reported. She is the first artist to win for a sound work: she recorded herself singing a 16th-century Scottish lament under three bridges in Glasgow. The prize, established in 1984 by the Tate in London, goes to a British artist under age 50 and comes with about $39,000. Ms. Philipsz beat out Dexter Dalwood, known for his contemporary take on traditional history paintings; Angela de la Cruz, a painter and sculptor nominated for her installation “After,” at the Camden Arts Center in London; and the Otolith Group, consisting of the London artists Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, who make documentary films for a series of exhibitions called “A Long Time Between Suns.” (Finalists each receive about $7,800.) Ms. Philipsz is only the fourth woman to win the award, after Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Wearing and Tomma Abts. In a statement the judges said they “admired the way in which her work provokes both intellectual and instinctive responses and reflects a series of decisions about the relationship between sound and sight” and that she “draws on the immersive properties of sound and uses her own voice to create powerful sculptural experiences.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/scottish-artist-wins-turner-prize-for-a-recording/

The “Retreat from Marriage” report suggests that this frame held up more strongly in the 1970s than it does today. On some questions (the morality of premarital sex, whether a divorce should become harder to obtain) well-educated and less-educated Americans seem to have converged over the last few decades, or else the less-educated have become more permissive than college graduates. At the same time, rates of churchgoing have fallen much faster among less-educated Americans than they have among college graduates, to the point where there’s now a strongly positive correlation between education and church attendance — one that didn’t exist in the ’70s. (The recent trend toward secularization, it turns out, may have been driven more by community college dropouts than by Richard Dawkins-reading Ph.Ds.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/class-and-the-culture-war/

2010-12-08,Now Sparkling | Alexis Bittar Heads West,"West Coast fans of the jewelry designer Alexis Bittar now have three stores where they can view his creations. Last week, the Brooklyn-based jeweler opened a shop on Abbot Kinney in Venice, Calif., another on West Third Street in Los Angeles, and next week he’ll open on Filmore Street in Pacific Heights in San Francisco. Expanding at a time when many other designers are just staying above water may be a bold move. But Bittar believes “it’s a great time to come into new cities with a force.” He chose Los Angeles, in particular, because he feels the city, along with New York, “shapes the country in terms of trends.” San Francisco, on the other hand, is a revenue leader for the company; the new shop will cater to a woman Bittar describes as being more “artistic, with a personality more like New York City women.” The boutiques’ décor incorporates 1930s wallpaper that’s been sprayed with graffiti, along with a smattering of the taxidermy groupings that have become a Bittar design statement. “We’re creating animal hybrids with these, like putting swan wings on a gazelle,” he says. “On a theatric level, having a store is great. And I think it makes shopping fun.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/now-sparkling-alexis-bittar-heads-west/

2010-12-08,Shoe In | Pierre Hardy’s New Digs,"The artist Dan Graham has not gone into retail design as far as we know, but you could easily mistake Pierre Hardy’s first United States boutique, in the West Village, for one of Graham’s installations. His glass and mirror pavilions, which are often plunked down into incongruous environments (say, a forest or the roof of the former DIA building in Chelsea), play tricks on the eye, integrating the spectator into the structure’s reflected surfaces. “He’s my dream artist,” Hardy said earlier this week, acknowledging the homage. His shop, at 30 Jane Street, which was designed by David Mann of MR. Architecture + Decor is a little jewel box — all smokey brown glass and mirrors; its situation, ensconced within the rough and crudely patched walls of a historic carriage house, feels both serene and strangely precarious. “It’s exactly the opposite of Paris,” Hardy explained. “There you have historical places you can’t touch and you have to work with it. Here we had to destroy and rebuild everything because what was here was unusable. We tried to do something more precious in the middle of something more raw.” A particularly Grahamesque touch comes in the form of two large plates of interlocking glass that section off the 1,400-square-foot space into semi-private cubbies so you can catch furtive glimpses of the woman trying on Hardy’s special New York “Skyline” shoes next to you (Um, excuse me, do those come in my size?), and still maintain the illusion that you have the place all to yourself.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/shoe-in-pierre-hardys-new-digs/

2010-12-09,Class and the Culture War (II),"One final point on the National Marriage Project report. I’ve been emphasizing the bad news, but I do think it’s genuinely good news that well-educated opinion — as opposed to just well-educated behavior — has been moving in a more conservative direction on divorce. (48 percent of college-educated Americans now agree that “divorce should be more difficult to obtain,” up from just 36 percent in the 1970s.) When social conservatives try to envision public policy responses to the crisis of the American family, they’re almost inevitably stymied by the fact that our upper class (which is, by extension, our policymaking class), while increasingly conservative in the way its members arrange their own private lives, remains intensely allergic to the kind of legal and cultural paternalism that certain earlier elites practiced as a matter of course. I’ve suggested before that America would benefit if its upper class showed “a willingness to translate some of the more conservative habits they’ve embraced (or partially embraced) in their personal lives into law and public policy,” but I’ve never seen much reason for optimism that our elite might actually move in this direction. So the fact that there’s been an uptick in college-educated support for reforming divorce laws is better news than I expected — and a sign, perhaps, that the educated class’s present mix of private conservatism and public permissiveness isn’t set in stone.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/class-and-the-culture-war-ii/

I’ve seen two of the shows (in Paris and Tokyo); the latest one I had to catch online. It was held in the house, on the Rue Cambon. Called Paris-Byzance, the collection didn’t quite soar off to Byzantium — too somber in color and shape, I suppose — but I liked the use of square shapes (jeweled buttons especially), the straight-line long dresses, many of the murky carpet-colored tweeds, the flat sandals and Freja’s slouchy pants.

What made him exceptional in any case was the unquantifiable combination of power and speed, only hinted at in yardage totals or points. Florid descriptions by the sportswriters of the day and recollections by those who played with him and against him make up a majority of the record. One reporter described his broken-field running as demonstrating “amazing intelligence,” as he evaded tacklers “by an easy lope that carries him over the ground at remarkable speed without betraying any undue haste.” His famed coach at Carlisle, Pop Warner, taught his player the technique of “unexpected contact,” which Thorpe mastered, where you sometimes fake the defensive player to make him stop moving, “then, wham, you hit him with the hip or stiff arm,” in the words of a teammate.

Run a hand over the sequins and they flip over, revealing a paler underside; if the path of the caress is retraced, they return to their original position. The idea of making a garment that recorded touch was, says Broach, “seductive as soon we came across the fabric.

2010-12-10,American Girl,"Many readers of “Little Women” have fantasized about being Jo; a few about being Meg, Beth or Amy. After reading Susan Cheever’s biography of Louisa May Alcott, even fewer would want to change places with the novel’s author. Like her heroine, Alcott was a bookish tomboy with three sisters, a writer who churned out pseudonymous melodramas before finding fame as a domestic novelist. Unlike Jo, Alcott never married, concluding that “liberty is a better husband than love.” Where Jo romps with her own children as well as a houseful of her husband’s students, Alcott declared that she “never liked girls” and stayed clear of children until adopting a niece at 48. A third difference is that “Little Women” portrays a matriarchal household made up of a mother, her daughters and their cook. Adding a servant spared her characters some of the domestic work that ate up Alcott’s own time. An even greater wish-fulfillment, however, lay in subtracting the man of the house. The March girls spend much of the novel waiting for their father to return from the Civil War, but in real life Alcott was the one who left Concord, Mass., in 1861 to nurse wounded soldiers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Price-t.html

The idea is that yearning makes us human, and our idiosyncratic desires often get us into interesting forms of trouble. At the start of his new novel, “Sunset Park,” Paul Auster merrily disregards Vonnegut’s rule, introducing Miles Heller as a man with no longings or hopes who has trained himself to want “as little as humanly possible.” On the surface, “Sunset Park” is fairly straightforward, without Auster’s trademark postmodern flourishes.

If that is incorrect, repeating it here is no more or less unfair than the way he himself massaged the facts of his life for public consumption. Carroll was a product of his imagination, like many of the best poets (Col. Tom Parker, Guillaume Apollinaire, Josef von Sternberg), and he was one of the best ­poets. There’s a parallel time and world inhabited by those who understand that all information is legend, that experience is show business. That’s why Hollywood is the dream factory and Carroll’s first commercial poetry collection was “Living at the Movies” (and perhaps why his “Selected Poems” is called “Fear of Dreaming”).

2010-12-10,European Exotic,"Hedy Lamarr, born Hedwig Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, enjoyed an early if not particularly auspicious start in Max Reinhardt’s theater, and a few bit parts in movies before the Czech director Gustav Machaty cast her as the centerpiece of “Ecstasy.” The idyll of a young bride, married to a frigid older man, who finds liberation in the arms of a virile engineer was genuinely audacious in its concentration on a woman’s thwarted desire. But what made it the scandal of its time — 1933 — and onward were bucolic nude scenes of the star swimming and chasing a runaway horse, and rapturous close-ups of her sexual awakening. Seeing it now, one imagines generations of adolescents approaching it expecting soft-core titillation and being disappointed by the wholesomeness of a girl who is less sex goddess than pudgy teenager with small breasts (about which more to come). In an all-but-silent movie that has more in common with Leni Riefenstahl’s mountain-girl films (not to mention Soviet paeans to the Noble Worker), Hedwig is radiantly and un-self-consciously “au naturel,” lovely but as yet unformed, ­undefined.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Haskell-t.html

This ought not be limited to classes like Schamus’s; it should be an essential part of every education. The next generation will be the first in our nation’s history to be less educated while spending more time in school because of the obsessive focus on education as only a means to a future paycheck. I hope Schamus’s students wander far and wide and continue the essential pollination of all our “professional” endeavors with his particular brand of “weird.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/magazine/12Letters-t-THEPROFESSOR_LETTERS.html

Like the keto diet, enteral nutrition — an all-liquid diet — has been recognized for decades as an effective treatment for Crohn’s. But in spite of randomized, controlled trials confirming its efficacy, few doctors prescribe it, and patients who try it face the same “curiosity bordering on alarm” that Vogelstein describes. Unfortunately, the proliferation of quack dietary treatments has made gaining acceptance of nutritional therapies that actually have solid science behind them an uphill battle.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/magazine/12Letters-t-ABIGFATMIRAC_LETTERS.html

At 70 Mr. Brooks could easily rest on his laurels: a roster of credits that includes “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and “Taxi,” “Broadcast News” and “Terms of Endearment,” not to mention his current day job as an executive producer of “The Simpsons”; he was also a writer and producer on “The Simpsons Movie” in 2007. Instead he’s getting back into the game with “How Do You Know,” a romantic comedy (which Columbia Pictures will release on Friday) about the intertwined lives of a professional softball player (Reese Witherspoon), her self-assured boyfriend (Owen Wilson), an executive (Paul Rudd) in legal trouble, and his father (Mr. Nicholson).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/movies/12brooks.html

S. Lewis, could end here. The weekend was much worse for two stars considered among Hollywood’s most bankable: Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie saw their new film, “The Tourist,” fizzle in second place with about $17 million. That result may not sound terrible, but “The Tourist” cost GK Films about $100 million to make and Sony Pictures Entertainment tens of millions to market. Sony acknowledged that sales were “soft” but said the studio expected the overseas reception to be “substantially stronger.” “Tangled” (Walt Disney Studios) was third with about $14.6 million for a three-week total of $115.6 million. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” (Warner Brothers) was fourth with $8.5 million in its fourth weekend for a total of $257.7 million, while “Unstoppable” (Fox) was fifth with $3.8 million for a five-week total of $74.3 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/movies/13arts-SLOWSTARTFOR_BRF.html

The mural, on a wall of the museum’s Geffen Contemporary wing, was planned as a kind of advertisement for an ambitious exhibition focusing on street art that the museum will open in April. But as Blu neared completion of the mural – which conveyed a strident antiwar message, showing rows of caskets draped with one-dollar bills instead of flags – the museum changed its mind and began painting it over on Thursday.

2010-12-16,Composing a Church-Going Western,"At the party following the New York premiere of “True Grit” on Tuesday night, the 14-year-old star, Hailee Steinfeld, held court with her 15-year-old best friend, Katee Cassidy, prancing around the Pool Room at the Four Seasons restaurant holding hands. The prancing was greatly helped by the fact that Ms. Steinfeld had changed out of the purple stilettos she wore on the red carpet and into silver glitter hi-tops. Toward the end of the night, another of the movie’s stars, Jeff Bridges, dressed down too, getting all Dude-like in his wrinkled white shirt and posing for photos with a glass — of what appeared to be water — in his hand. As usual, Joel and Ethan Coen, who wrote and directed the film, declined to talk. But the Bagger was glad to find Carter Burwell, the film’s composer. Mr. Burwell has always written music for the Coens, as well as for Spike Jonze’s films, like “Where the Wild Things Are.” This awards season he is also represented by “The Kids Are All Right.” He lives and records in New York; the score for “True Grit” was composed at the Manhattan Center with a 70-piece orchestra. And it was being fine-tuned until the very last moment – the last recording session was held Nov. 8. Mr. Burwell is a member of the Academy, but, he revealed to us, that didn’t make him an expert on who would win the Oscar for best score. (Readers, you’re on your own.) But Mr. Burwell did clue us into the process of composing that memorably grand music.

Wednesday’s episode, the last before the “Survivor: Nicaragua” finale on Sunday, easily outperformed its 8 p.m. time-slot competitors, including the first half of NBC’s reality competition “The Sing-Off,” which averaged 8.4 million from 8 to 10. NBC ranked second for the night, garnering 6.9 million viewers at 10 for a rerun of “Law & Order: SVU,” although that too lagged behind CBS’s drama “The Defenders” in the hour (10.2 million). Fox was third with a new episode of “Human Target” at 8 (5.8 million) and the season finale of “Hell’s Kitchen” at 9 (5.9 million).

2010-12-17,A Closer Look at the G.D.P.,"As the end of the year approaches, it seems appropriate to look at the economy from a macro-perspective – that is, at the level of gross domestic product or G.D.P. – to determine if the economy is growing, and if so, what G.D.P. components are contributing to growth. While this is not a definitive analysis of the economy, it does show if things are moving in the right direction. All of the statistical information that follows is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or B.E.A., and is inflation-adjusted.According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession ended in June 2009, or the end of the second quarter of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has grown for 5 consecutive quarters at the following quarter to quarter rates: 1.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 3.7 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent. This is a median growth rate of 2.5 percent. The median growth rate for the first five quarters of the early 1990s and early 2000s expansions were 2.7 percent and 2 percent respectively, placing the growth rate of the current recovery right in the middle of the pack. This also indicates that slower growth at the beginning of a recovery is not atypical.",U.S.,https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/a-closer-look-at-the-g-d-p/

They understatethe scale of the interventions neededto effect change, even as they exaggerate the potential of American clout, and they understate the complexity of the problems facing these countries, which can lead him to champion potentially disastrous ideas. Underlying these simplifications is a deeply American faith in our own capacity — for doing good, for getting things done — a faith that Hollywood has always been happy to indulge. I wish that Prendergast would focus more on the capacity of local people, many of whom are working at extraordinary personal risk to bring peace to their lands.

Without fail, he would respond by thanking me or letting me know that he had passed it on to the appropriate leadership. But what about the future of JPMorgan Chase? Jamie won’t be there forever. Sooner or later a successor will arise. And since our nation must be even more risk-conscious thanJamie, we must remember that no matter how much thought and time is put into the succession decision,it may place us in the position of facing a far-too-big-to-fail bank that is headed by a successor not nearlyso astute, sure-footed or thoughtful as Jamie Dimon.

2010-12-17,Running in Place,"For Damon, the white South African protagonist of “In a Strange Room,” travel is a mostly pleasureless compulsion. In each of the three linked stories that make up this novel, he moves from place to place and country to country “in acute anxiety,” like a fever running its course. He is fleeing something — a romantic disappointment is mentioned in the first story, and hints of post-­apartheid moral exhaustion pervade all three. Yet what he experiences over the course of his travels is not the fool’s paradise of distraction from himself but just the opposite: the steady revelation of a central aspect of his character. By the third story, in which he travels to India with a mentally ill friend who comes apart disastrously, some immense, sad reality of life seems to be asserting itself through Damon’s quest to keep himself moving, long past any hope that his travels will heal him. Written in spare, controlled prose, these stories have a powerful cumulative effect that is on one level hard and comfortless, yet somehow also tender and humane.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/books/review/Russo-t.html

You’re supposed to prefer the father, all graciousness and handwritten little notes, over the son, who — even in memoirs written at age 64 after two terms as president — seems callow. But I would take George W. Bush’s schoolboy petulance and solipsism, which at least seem authentic and human, over George H. W.’s grandee-with-a-switchblade any day. There is something very modern, almost New Agey, and endearingly insecure, about the tone and posture the son adopts in “Decision Points.” Even as he’s bombing Baghdad back to the Stone Age, he’s very much in touch with his feelings.

Theirs was the era of “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings” and “the holiness of the heart’s affections.” Coming from Leopardi, however, that credo can seem a little peculiar. Stunted by scoliosis, wearied from melancholy and badgered throughout his 38 years by his mother, a reactionary marchesa who stormed around the family palazzo in her riding boots, Leopardi was never an adventurer of felt experience.

Despite insisting that he had no political ambition, he spent much of his life in politics. The third president of the United States, he saw himself foremost as a farmer, gardener and philosopher. Jefferson’s character was so multilayered and contradictory that successive generations have identified with and celebrated utterly different aspects of the same man. In a similar fashion, historians and biographers have studied various facets of his life — from the obvious, like his political thought, to the more obscure, like his love of wine. Now Virginia Scharff, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico, has sought to understand Jefferson through his relationships with the women he loved: his mother, Jane Randolph; his wife, Martha; his daughters and granddaughters; and his slave mistress, Sally Hemings.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/books/review/Wulf-t.html

On ESPN’s 3-D broadcast, the 7-foot-3 Ilgauskas towered over the players for the Heat and the Knicks in a manner that has no true equivalent in a standard broadcast.

Imax sales contributed 24 percent of that gross, indicating strong interest from core science-fiction fans; the question now is whether Disney can keep the momentum going over the Christmas holiday period and reach a wider audience. “Yogi Bear” (Warner Brothers) was second with $16.7 million, an underwhelming total considering this picture had the benefit of higher-priced 3-D screenings. “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” (20th Century Fox) was third with about $12.4 million for a two-week total of $42.8 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. In its first weekend in wide release “The Fighter” (Paramount Pictures and Relativity Media) was fourth with $12.4 million, a strong result for a gritty adult drama that cost $25 million to make. “The Tourist” (Sony Pictures Entertainment and GK Films) was fifth with $8.7 million for a two-week total of $30.8 million. Sony’s romantic comedy “How Do You Know,” directed by James L. Brooks for over $100 million as a vehicle for Ms. Witherspoon, sold $7.6 million in tickets. Fox Searchlight’s “Black Swan,” starring Natalie Portman, performed better despite playing in 959 theaters compared with 2,483 for “How Do You Know.” The weekend total for “Black Swan” was about $8.3 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/movies/20arts-LEGACY_BRF.html
2010-12-20,Ozawa’s Children Accept Award for Him,"The confluence was almost perfect. The Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa was to receive the Shigemitsu Award for distinction in international cultural affairs after his Carnegie Hall concert with the Saito Kinen Orchestra on Saturday evening. The award, established a decade ago to honor Mamoru Shigemitsu, the Japanese foreign minister who engineered his country’s entry into the United Nations in 1956, is presented annually on Dec. 18, the anniversary of that event. Peter Grilli, the president of the Japan Society of Boston, won the award last year, and when the society subsequently took over administration of the award, he determined that Mr. Ozawa would become the first Japanese winner. What he didn’t realize at the time was that on the very evening of the award presentation, Mr. Ozawa would be conducting Benjamin Britten’s great internationalist creation, the “War Requiem.” In the words of the society’s news release, the work “echoes the antiwar sentiments of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu’s General Assembly speech as Japan was inducted into the United Nations.” But as it happened, the performance of this imposing work left Mr. Ozawa  suffering from sciatica and still depleted after surgery for esophageal cancer early this year  exhausted and unable to attend the presentation at a postconcert party for the performers at a restaurant near Carnegie. Instead Mr. Grilli  in the presence of Yutaka Shigemitsu, a 92-year-old nephew of the foreign minister, who founded the award  presented the award to Mr. Ozawa’s daughter, Seira, and son, Yuki.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/arts/music/20arts-OZAWASCHILDR_BRF.html

2010-12-20,A Pop-Up Larder in Echo Park,"For 10 days this month, a group of enterprising young women converted a carriage house in Los Angeles’s Echo Park neighborhood into a larder that they called the Cantry. They christened themselves the Pantlers — after the name given to the servant in charge of the bread and the pantry of a great house — built shelves and lined them with an assortment of canned and pickled goods, tinctures and creams, and drawings and zines. Small jars containing tea lights and flowers were tied to bicycle wheels suspended from the ceiling, becoming clever D.I.Y. chandeliers to light the long refectory-style table made by a woodworker friend. Through word of mouth and Facebook posts, people came to trade and barter their own wares for ginger beer, pomegranate jelly, bacon-infused bourbon, pie fillings and sundry items. A neighbor even offered to trade music for goods. Every night a guest chef cooked a family-style dinner while D.J. friends spun tunes and recipes were shared. The Pantlers are all makers, “obsessed with food, gardening and doing things for themselves,” and had talked about sharing their kitchen, home lab and garden experiments for over a year before opening the Cantry.

That was the proximate cause, at least; there was more to it. Beyond the election, South Carolina was no longer happy in a union with the free states, where northern opponents of slavery were allowed to openly denounce the “peculiar institution” in Congress and in their home states.

2010-12-21,A Plan to Make Homelessness History,"This is a story about a plan to end chronic homelessness in the United States. It’s not an indeterminate “war on homelessness,” but a methodical approach to do away with a major social problem. Each day, roughly 700,000 people in the country are homeless. About 120,000 are chronically homeless. They often live on the streets for years and have mental disabilities, addiction problems and life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. They are also five times more likely than ordinary Americans to have suffered a traumatic brain injury, which may have precipitated their homelessness. Without direct assistance, many will remain homeless for the rest of their lives — at enormous cost to society and themselves.Against this backdrop, the 100,000 Homes Campaign has set the goal of placing 100,000 chronically homeless people — pinpointing those who face the greatest risk of dying on the streets —  into permanent supportive housing by July 2013. It’s the human welfare equivalent of NASA’s race to put a man on the moon. Whether the goal is achieved or not, the campaign is shifting the way cities address a problem that has often been seen as more of a nuisance than a public health emergency.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/a-plan-to-make-homelessness-history/

Pee-wee historians – and you know who you are – may recall that HBO previously broadcast a “Pee-wee Herman Show” special in 1981, taped at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles. That show, which Mr. Reubens and his colleagues at the Groundlings comedy theater began performing in 1980, would go on to form the basis of the “Pee-wee Herman Show” currently being presented at the Stephen Sondheim Theater on Broadway. HBO said it would tape its new “Pee-wee” special immediately after the show’s Broadway run ends on Jan. 2; a broadcast date wasn’t announced.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/scream-real-loud-pee-wee-herman-show-coming-back-to-hbo/

Experts long thought that hefting weight of almost any kind would contribute to lymphedema in breast-cancer survivors and advised them to avoid picking up or carrying heavy purses, grocery bags, suitcases or their own children and to steer away, by all means, from formal weight training. But in last year’s study, breast-cancer survivors with a history of lymphedema who completed a slow, progressive program of weight training suffered fewer subsequent flare-ups of the condition than women who didn’t train, suggesting that weight lifting might actually combat lymphedema, not cause it.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/phys-ed-lifting-weights-after-breast-cancer/

2010-12-22,Andrew Johnson Dead," Andrew Johnson, expanded-President of the United States and member of the Senate from Tennessee, died at the house of his daughter, Mrs. W.R. Brown, near Elizabethtown, Carter County, Tenn., at 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The history this man leaves is a rare one. His career was remarkable, even in this country; it would have been quite impossible in any other. It presents the spectacle of a man who never went to school cession of posts of civil responsibility to the highest office in the land, and evincing his continued hold upon the popular heart by a subsequent election to the Senate in the teeth of a bitter personal and political opposition. Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, N.C., Dec. 29, 1808. His father, Jacob Johnson, who was in the humblest circumstances, was drowned while attempting to save the life of Editor Henderson, of the Raleigh Gazette, in 1812, and six years later young Andrew, at the age of ten, was apprenticed to a tailor named Selby. School was then out of the question, of course, and the outlook was that the young man would grow up to an illiterate life. But the intelle and the outlook was that the young man would grow up to an illiterate life. But the intellect that was in him was aroused through the instrumentality of a Raleigh gentleman, whose practice it was to read aloud to the tailor's employees from books of published speeches. The speeches of some of the British statesmen particularly attracted his attention, and he set about learning to read with the same determination which characterized his later life. By resolute application after work hours and in moments taken from sleep, he soon succeeded and was able to read the speeches and other books for himself. He left Raleigh in 1824, before his apprenticeship had expired, and went to Laurens Court House, S.C., where he worked two years at his trade, and then, after a return to Raleigh and a brief stay there, he removed with his mother to Greenville, Tenn. He soon married, and was fortunate enough to get a wife who was a helpmeet to him in every sense of the word. She set herself at once to supply his greatest lack, became his teacher, giving him such oral instruction as was possible while he was at work, and teaching him writing, arithmetic, and other branches at night. Under her faithful tuition he acquired a fair education. The native forces of his mind supplied the remaining elements of his success.

","Lucretia Mott died last evening at her residence, near Philadelphia, in her eighty-eighth year. Mrs. Mott, whose name was probably as widely known as that of any other public woman in this or the preceding generation, was born in the old whaling town of Nantucket on the 3d of January, 1793. Her maiden name was Coffin. When 11 years old, her parents removed to Boston, where she went to school, finishing her education at a young ladies' boarding school in Dutchess County, N.Y., in which, when only 15 years old, she became a teacher. In 1809 she rejoined her parents, who had removed to Philadelphia, and in 1811, two years later, was married to James Mott. She was then in her nineteenth year. Her husband went into partnership with her father, Mr. Coffin, and Mrs. Mott again turned her attention to educational matters. In 1817 she took charge of a school in Philadelphia, and in 1818 began to preach. She made extended pilgrimages through New-England, Pennsylvania, Maryland and parts of Virginia advocating Quaker principles and waging at the same time a vigorous warfare against the evils of intemperance and slavery. In the division of the Society of Friends in 1827 she adhered to the Hicksites. Mrs. Mott took a prominent part in organizing the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia in 1833, and was a delegate to the famous World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840, where, in company with other female delegates, she was refused admission on account of her sex. She was also prominent in the original Woman's Rights Convention held at Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848, over which her husband, James Mott, presided. During the last 30 years she has been conspicuous in such gatherings and in annual meetings of the Society of Friends.

2010-12-23,Alaska: Court Ruling Favors Murkowski,"Joe Miller, the Republican Senate candidate, lost another legal battle when the State Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that voters do not have to spell a write-in candidate’s name perfectly for their vote to be counted. Citing decades of legal precedent, the court ruled that votes should count as long as election officials can determine a voter’s intent. The court also ruled that there was no evidence of fraud or other irregularities in the election. Unofficial state election results show Mr. Miller losing by more than 10,000 votes to Senator Lisa Murkowski, whom he defeated in the Republican primary in August. Ms. Murkowski later returned to the race as a write-in candidate. She declared victory on Nov. 17, after a hand count of write-in votes showed her well ahead. Mr. Miller has not conceded, and he has prevented certification of the race through repeated legal challenges in state and federal court.

Mr. Videla, 85, is considered to have been the main force behind the violence known as the dirty war that included the forced disappearances of up to an estimated 30,000 people through 1983. In April, Argentina’s Supreme Court overturned a 1990 pardon for Mr. Videla and other military men involved in the dictatorship, paving the way for him to be tried for murder, kidnapping and torture, in the case that led to Wednesday’s sentence. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 after another trial, in which he was convicted of murder, torture and other crimes. On Tuesday Mr. Videla told the court that “yesterday’s enemies are in power and from there, they are trying to establish a Marxist regime.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/world/americas/23briefs-EXDICTATORSE_BRF.html

In the southern city of Basra, home to about 2,000 Christians, church leaders said they had canceled a New Year’s Eve celebration. Since the assault on the Baghdad church, a new wave of Christians has been fleeing to northern Iraq or abroad.

The project is an extension of Cappello’s 2009 graduation work at the Royal College of Art, and will recycle spruces, pines and firs into unique, handcrafted three-legged stools designed by Cappello. The stools, which cost about $621 each, can be ordered from the United States too. Obviously, a buyer from the States won’t be able to send in a tree to be recycled, but there will be plenty of “orphans” available in London, where it’s estimated that most of this year’s 976,000 Christmas trees will simply be thrown away.

In its upper reaches, the Blanco runs in a whitewater cascade, where native cutthroat trout thrive. In the valley, on the meadowland of El Rancho Pinoso, a privately owned ranch that rents out cabins and provides fly-fishing access, the water slows and deepens, providing an excellent habitat for introduced rainbows that frequently exceed 20 inches.

2010-12-24,Santa Safari,"I went on safari this season to track down the true Santa Claus. I found whole herds of them. But which was real? At my first stop, the annual parade of Sidewalk Santas sponsored by the Volunteers of America, I saw several dozen walking up Fifth Avenue as tourists gawked. The next stop was SantaCon, an event that defines itself as a chance for “guys and girls of legal age” to “dress up like Santa and go cavorting around town.” I was startled by the sight of hundreds of Santas crowding streets and bars before gathering at Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. Among them was at least one Jack Skellington Santa, channeling the spirit of “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” alongside a Santa whose suit was adorned with a much-repeated line from “A Christmas Story”: “You’ll shoot your eye out, kid.” I found a rickshaw wallah who dresses like Santa. I asked him why. “It seems to make people happy,” he said. I tracked down the Santa of the “Radio City Christmas Spectacular” — a Kentucky native, it turns out — in his dressing room at the music hall, where he’s been reporting to work for 24 years. Of course, I went to the prime preserve, at Macy’s Santaland. There, I found a 4-year-old girl curled up on Santa’s lap and thought of Edmund Gwenn’s portrayal of Kris Kringle in “Miracle on 34th Street.” It dawned on me that everyone I’d seen was the real Santa, because Santa is whomever we want him to be.",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/santa-safari/

2010-12-24,Lawsuit Filed Over ‘Black Swan’ Production Credit,"A New York film production company has sued its former president, claiming that “gross lapses in judgment” cost the company millions of dollars in lost revenue and a producer credit on the movie “Black Swan,” Reuters reported on Thursday. The defendant, Aaron Kaufman, called the claims baseless. “Black Swan,” starring Natalie Portman, is considered an Oscar favorite and has been nominated for four Golden Globe awards. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, the production company, Overnight L.L.C., led by Rick Schwartz, accuses Mr. Kaufman of misrepresenting his skill and experience and pretending “to be knowledgeable about the financing of motion pictures when he was not.” Mr. Schwartz, who was credited as executive producer on “Black Swan,” has helped produce the movies “Machete,” “Gangs of New York,” “The Aviator” and “The Others.” Mr. Kaufman said it was only after he joined the company and helped secure a role in the production of “Machete” and “Black Swan” that Mr. Schwartz was able to produce any films.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/lawsuit-filed-over-black-swan/

Put aside the near certainty that Bernhard would have disparaged anything you might say about his work — not just disparaged it, but attacked it with an acid-tongued rant that eviscerated your words, your intellect and your pathetic petit-bourgeois existence. You still have to deal with the almost overwhelming ambition, common to Bernhard fans, to correct his woeful stature in the English-speaking world, as well as the equally oppressive realization that opportunities for doing so are fast running out.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Peck-t.html

The scouting newsletter The Hoop Scoop had recently proclaimed Walker the best eighth grader in the country; now the pre-eminent sports magazine was going to take that hype to a new level. While the article about Walker carried the requisite caveats — about whether he would fulfill his potential and whether it was even fair to be placing such expectations on a kid — it described him as “14 going on LeBron.” The reason was not just Walker’s physical gifts, but also his Amateur Athletic Union coach, Joe Keller, who, according to Keller himself, was keeping Walker on a righteous path — arranging for him to be home-schooled by a tutor, checking to make sure he did his academic work and paying as much attention to the boy’s well-being as to his jump shot. “I’m not going to get a thing out of this,” Keller told S.I. “My only hope is that maybe, one day, when Demetrius is in the N.B.A., he can come back and sponsor my team.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Zengerle-t.html

But the gambit works. His exuberant ramblings gain a propulsion that would be lost if the comma splices were curbed, the phrases divided into sentences.

The violin, made in 1696, is one of about 400 made by Stradivarius that are still known to exist. The police arrested and charged John Maughan, 26, and two teenagers on Wednesday. The names of the youths, 16 and 14 years old, were not included in news reports because of British law. Mr. Maughan is in custody and the two teenagers are free on bail.

Paramount’s “True Grit,” starring Jeff Bridges as a cranky bounty hunter and made for $38 million, was second with $25.6 million  doubling pre-release projections  for a new total of $36.8 million. “Tron: Legacy” (Disney) fell to third place with about $20 million for a two-week total of $88.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. “Tron: Legacy,” which carried a $170 million budget and marketing costs of well over $100 million, is struggling to cross over to a broad audience, at least in North America, and must now rely on strong overseas sales for profitability. “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” (Fox) was fourth with $10.8 million for a new total of about $64 million. “Yogi Bear” (Warner Brothers) was fifth with $8.8 million for a new total of $36.8 million.

Ms. Murkowski ran as a write-in candidate after losing to Joe Miller in the Republican primary. Unofficial results have showed her winning by more than 10,000 votes, but Mr. Miller has delayed certification through legal challenges, arguing that write-in votes must be spelled perfectly. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled against him last week. On Tuesday, Judge Ralph R. Beistline of United States District Court dismissed his federal case. Shortly after the ruling, the state announced it had certified the results. It later corrected the announcement to say it would certify the race on Thursday.

Husk offers hearty, somewhat masculine fare with a common theme: “If it ain’t Southern, it ain’t walkin’ in the door,” Brock says. This manifesto carries over to the bar, which is adjacent to the restaurant in a restored antebellum structure and boasts a killer bourbon list. Exquisite small-batch varieties are served in glasses made from recycled wine bottles, each with a “punt” in the bottom, which creates a kind of “moat” for the amber liquid. When a hand-molded sphere of clear ice is set on top (for cooling without dilution), the only real contact between one’s 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle and its icy companion is while sipping.

Of course, I had considered my life ruined many times before — other medical and romantic crises — but I was always wrong. This issue, though — childlessness — really did seem different. My two closest girlfriends chose not to have children and didn’t regret it, and I envied them, but I didn’t know how to feel as they did. No one gets everything they want in life, but to be childless felt like being deprived of something essential: the primal human experience. When I was 39 and single, I was in northern Uganda, and a woman there asked about my children. I said I didn’t have any, and she solemnly told me that she would pray to God to remove my curse.

The Japanese company had asked the British designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, of the firm BarberOsgerby, to create an exhibition to showcase its Monolithic Design concept, in which its home entertainment products are seamlessly integrated into interior design. The exhibition itself was indeed interesting — BarberOsgerby designed an anechoic chamber, lined with foam blocks in the shape of triangular solids, in which to demonstrate projects like Sony’s pairing of a big-screen TV and near-field speakers to create a personal entertainment “space,” and a TV cabinet, made with a 3-D printer, that was porous enough to transmit sound from the speakers inside it.

The big shock here, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Eugene Robinson, is not that a Harvard professor misused the subjective case (“who” for “whom”) and inelegantly ended a sentence with a preposition; it is, rather, that Gates belongs to an elite enclave beyond the sergeant’s experience or imagination.

One — the Anglo-Irish travel writer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor, now 95 — infiltrated Crete during World War II, disguised as a shepherd, and captured a German general (an exploit that won him a Distinguished Service Order and inspired a film starring Dirk Bogarde). Fermor’s great friend Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford Cavendish, known as Debo, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, now 90, is the youngest (and last surviving) of the endlessly fascinating Mitford sisters, the six daughters of the eccentric Lord and Lady Redesdale. In 1956, in a letter Fermor wrote to friends after spending a holiday at Lismore, the Devonshires’ castle in Ireland, he tried to describe his hostess. She was “funny, touching, ravishing and enslaving,” he wrote, which made up for her “engagingly unashamed philistinism.” The duchess told Fermor she hated books — with the exception of Beatrix Potter’s “Ginger and Pickles,” the tale of a dog and cat who run a country grocery.

But within the art world, she remains a beloved and influential figure. The pre-eminent painter-chronicler of New York bohemia, Neel specialized in frank, nervy portraits of artists and intellectuals and various other marginalized types, like black children, pregnant women and old men. More often that not, her subjects are shown in minimally decorated apartments, sitting by themselves or with a friend. They make you feel as if you have wandered into a room where they will continue sitting long after you have left. They are not classically attractive, with their shaggy hair and spindly, crooked German Expressionist fingers, but everyone — babies included — has a look of wide-eyed intelligence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Solomon-t.html

Yet this season brings two new biographies that deal with the very same period: the 19 years she spent in publishing as an editor for Viking Press and then Doubleday. “Reading Jackie” by William Kuhn and “Jackie as Editor” by Greg Lawrence represent a rebranding of the legend, a strenuous effort to burnish her literary legacy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Gordon-t.html

The toe shoes that are among the principal tools of this torment also seem to be surrogates and scapegoats; they are scraped, mutilated and disfigured by the dancers in a symbolic re-enactment of the violence they perform upon themselves in their ruthless pursuit of perfection.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/movies/awardsseason/02scot.html

2010-12-31,Eric Wilson’s Key Fashion Moments of 2010,"1. Looking back at what truly resonated with audiences outside of the fashion elite, it is tough to think of anything more substantial than the hullabaloo that took place this summer over a single dress  one that hardly anyone had a chance to get a good look at. That, of course, was the white strapless beaded wedding gown worn by Chelsea Clinton at a top-secret ceremony in Rhinebeck, N.Y., on July 31. As it happened, it was a dress by Vera Wang, seen by the public in only a handful of official portraits released by the Clinton family. The dress had some silvery belt thing at the waist and a very tight fitted bodice, and what looked like a rushing waterfall of tulle below the waist. To no small degree of dissatisfaction among the fashion press, Ms. Clinton’s gown was not destined to be hugely influential in the tradition of bridal gowns worn by glamorous members of prominent political or royal families (i.e., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, Princess Diana, Ivanka Trump). But frankly, she could have worn burlap and remained at the top of this list, since half the fun was in all the anticipation and speculation.

Dior held the show in the house, so everything was creamy with intimacy — just what editors love as they plop down next to friends — but it soon registered that Tavi Gevinson, the 13-year-old blogger, was in the front row. Some of the editors really hit her with looks. At the Armani show that night, the stares were openly hostile. It was obvious the older Italian ladies didn’t care to see a child in their midst. And Tavi wore a big bow-shaped hat that pointedly emphasized her juvenile stature. The fact is half the people were still in the dark about what was happening. Blogs?

Indeed, this excellent novelist and excellent critic concluded, “Superior criticism not only unifies and interprets a literary culture but has the power to imagine it into being.” To see what we are missing, all we have to do is contrast our own moment with the postwar decades “when Lionel Trilling prevailed at Columbia,” and “Edmund Wilson, Irving Howe and Alfred Kazin enlivened the magazines.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Kirsch-t-web.html
2010-12-31,Beyond the Critic as Cultural Arbiter,"Fifty years is a long time in any national literature, but in the extreme environment of American culture, fiction seems to find an incubator for unusually rapid growth. A half-century takes us from the era of formulaic romances and Gothic novels to the metaphysical theater of “Moby-Dick”; from Mark Twain working on his autobiography to John Barth’s first novel. Yet across the 50 years since Alfred Kazin lectured about the function of the critic, academic literary criticism in America has arguably changed more than the modern novel, while the kind of critic that preoccupied Kazin — one who writes for the public, “lives in literature” and tries to create standards — now finds her function revised by technological changes that have reconfigured an audience that was once atomized by America’s urban sprawl.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Burn-t-web.html
2010-12-31,Inside the List,"GUTENBERG MEN: The cover of the Jan. 9 Book Review contains a rare convergence of best sellers. The New York Times reporter David Carr (who spent three weeks on the nonfiction list with his 2008 memoir, “The Night of the Gun”) reviews a biography by Douglas Coupland (whose novel “Microserfs” was a business best seller in 1995) about the media-studies pioneer Marshall McLuhan (who had simultaneous paperback best sellers in 1967 with “The Medium Is the Massage” and “Understanding Media”).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/InsideList-t.html
2010-12-31,Masters of the Form,"The inspiration for the six essays anchoring the Book Review this week was Alfred Kazin’s polemic “The Function of Criticism Today,” written in 1960 (and published in Commentary). But Kazin belongs to a long tradition of critics who have cast a keen eye over their vocation. In fact, Kazin’s essay echoes T. S. Eliot’s “Function of Criticism,” published in 1923, which itself echoed Matthew Arnold’s celebrated “Function of Criticism at the Present Time,” written in 1864.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/LitCritBackPage-t.html
2010-12-31,"From the Critical Impulse, the Growth of Literature","“Your judgment . . . is true, but not all of it,” Tolstoy once wrote to the critic N. N. Strakhov, who had shared with the writer some comments on “Anna Karenina.”  “That is, it is all true, but what you have expressed does not express all that I meant. . . . It is one of the true things that can be said. If I wanted to express in words all that I meant to express by the novel, then I should have to write the same novel as I have written all over again.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Batuman-t-web.html
2010-12-31,The Intellectual at Play in the Wider World,"I don’t think of myself as a literary critic. I write about novels and short stories. But I am reluctant to describe what I do as “literary criticism,” as I like to move quickly beyond the literariness of a text — whether narrative techniques or quality of prose — and its aesthetic pleasures, to engage with the author’s worldview, implied or otherwise, and his or her location in history (of nation-states and empires, as well as of literary forms).

Has the critic become a quaint and touching figure engaged in an irrelevant, positively medieval pursuit, like monks illuminating manuscripts?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Roiphe-t-web.html
2010-12-31,Translating the Code Into Everyday Language,"I tend to shy away from big, sweeping, era-defining statements. It’s the fastest possible way to be wrong about the world, and usually just an excuse for various forms of sloppy thinking: cherry-picking, scapegoating, doomsaying, fear-mongering, sandbagging, arm-twisting, wool-gathering, leg-pulling. And yet it would be hard to dispute that over the last 5 or 10 years, the culture’s relationship to time has changed pretty drastically. The shift is so obvious that it’s boring, by now, even to name the culprits: Google, blogs, texting, tweets, iPhones, Facebook — a little army of tools that have given rise to (and grown out of) radically new habits of attention. Many of us are now addicted, on the dopamine-receptor level, to a moment-by-moment experience of life that’s defined by a behavior sometimes referred to as “time slicing”: jumping every few seconds between devices or windows or tabs, constantly swiveling the periscope of our attention around and around the horizon to see where the latest relevant data-burst might come from.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/books/review/Anderson-t-web.html
