The court sentenced Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum of the Kirt Monastery in the Tibetan area of Sichuan Province to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively. On Monday, the same court found a 46-year-old monk, Drongdru, guilty of “intentional homicide” in the death of the monk, a 16-year-old who was his nephew and disciple. Prosecutors said that after the teenager immolated himself, the three monks hid him and delayed emergency treatment. Human rights groups said the teenage monk was protesting government policies in Tibet. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/world/asia/01briefs-China.html

Signed a deficit-reduction act that balances the budget on the backs of the poor and working people of this country? I think not. The difference between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is that Clinton knows that the Republicans don’t play fair.

What exactly is a romantic dinner like between a gay man and a straight woman?  Ask each woman that ever met Tom, and they will tell you that they were under the charm of Tom. O.K., Tom, unfortunately for the woman, is gay. But he is very not so gay. Even the way he touches a woman, the way he puts his hand on your back or the way he opens the car for you, he’s a gentleman.

(John Lennon took his own holiday in Barcelona with the band’s manager, Brian Epstein.) For the upstart combo, it would be their first taste of the jet-set life and, in the saga of their ascent, a momentary breather about halfway up Mount Olympus. The first No. 1 record was in the bag, the next one was heading up the charts and full-blown Beatlemania was just a few months off. The island’s black sand, towering volcano and opportunities for sunstroke were as exotic to the Beatles as their newfound celebrity. But none of that notoriety followed them to Tenerife, where they stayed at the Voormann family cottage. The bandmates ran around asking the locals: “You know us? The Beatles?” — only to be met with bewilderment.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/magazine/lives-the-beatles-on-the-beach.html

2011-09-02,"The Too Black, Too White Presidency","The next time you see Barack Obama gliding into a White House press conference, take note of that jazzy walk. It is a dead ringer for the strut that was the bearing of choice among ­inner-city cool guys in the 1960s, when Barry Obama was still a tyke growing up in the exotic precincts of Hawaii and Indonesia. The Obama glide represents his embrace of a black aesthetic that was not his by circumstance of birth. It speaks on an intimate frequency to African-­American men, who have been smiling in recognition and rating it for style ever since he stepped into the national spotlight. President Obama is acutely aware of how to deploy the physical self to excellent effect. If we looked back closely at 2008, we would no doubt notice him amping up the glide for black audiences and dialing it back elsewhere.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/the-persistence-of-the-color-line-by-randall-kennedy-book-review.html

Room for millions of species — and quintillions of individuals — to coexist, and room for biologists to make significant discoveries about them by peering closely at their behaviors and their brains. In “Sex on Six Legs,” the biologist Marlene Zuk argues that insects — because they are both unlike us and, in surprising ways, like us — provide excellent fodder for studying the relative value of inheritance versus environment, the evolution of personality, the definition of language and the downside of growing bigger brains.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/sex-on-six-legs-by-marlene-zuk-book-review.html

It is poetic and affecting, and it features revealing descriptions of Bond, a transgender singer-songwriter and performance artist with a fervent following among New York City’s avant-garde. “Justin Vivian has learned to dance with V’s self,” Als writes, “to wear the heels and the suit that fit V’s being, all cut and formed to suit V’s soul, having earned it as so many of us earn it, through being brutalized and suppressed and sometimes through love, too.” (“V” is Bond’s preferred, gender-free pronoun.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/tango-my-childhood-backwards-and-in-high-heels-by-justin-vivian-bond-book-review.html

In today’s world this virtue is all the more vital, because now that we have largely tamed the scourges of nature, most of our troubles are self-inflicted.

2011-09-02,Living the Varieties of Virtual Experience,"In the first lecture from “The Varieties of Religious Experience,” entitled “Religion and Neurology,” William James criticizes as “simple-minded” what he calls “medical materialism,” the system of thought that “finishes up St. Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a discharging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic” or that “snuffs out St. Teresa as an hysteric, St. Francis of Assisi as an hereditary degenerate.” Such thinking, James said, isn’t strictly wrong, but extremely wrongheaded, since all thoughts and feelings, including those of the medical materialists themselves, are “organically conditioned” and thus equally prey to being dismissed. James concluded that St. Paul very likely did have a seizure, but that this had no bearing on the spiritual significance of his visions, which needed to be judged pragmatically, by the extent to which they offered “delight” or “good consequential fruits for life.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/luminarium-by-alex-shakar-book-review.html

In 1999 he put together a bunch of those strips as a photocopied comic book he called “Big Questions.” A few more issues followed, in which he started imagining more about the birds’ personalities and establishing who was responsible for the crumbs that fed them: an old, bent-over woman, living in a shack with her idiot grandson.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/big-questions-written-and-illustrated-by-anders-brekhus-nilsen-book-review.html

At 29, Spero Lucas, an unlicensed investigator for a criminal defense attorney (and anyone else who’ll give him a cut of the action), is considerably younger and friskier than the heavy-lidded private eyes who have imprinted their world-weary stamp on this genre. His values are also different, shaped by the street culture of his tough neighborhood and by his experiences as a Marine in Iraq. Even his musical tastes are more contemporary. (No moody blues for this guy, who prefers reggae, ska and dub.) “There are certain bars I don’t hang in,” Lucas explains. “I’m not gonna sit around and have drinks with people who are, you know, ironic.” He’s also man enough to put flowers on his father’s grave and pay regular visits to his mother.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/crime-mystery-novels-by-george-pelecanos-laura-lippman-martin-walker-and-sebastian-rotella.html

It may not also have been the end of inanity on the best-­seller list, but it was the beginning of a new interest in the Muslim world among Americans previously more preoccupied with Anne Heche’s “Call Me Crazy” and the television psychic John Edward’s “Crossing Over,” to name two top sellers for the week that ended Sept. 8. At first, Americans seemed too stunned to go to the bookstore, but by Sept. 22, “Germs,” an account of biological weaponry and America’s readiness against it by the New York Times reporters Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg and William Broad, had hit the hardcover list (no doubt thanks in part to the anthrax scare that killed five Americans and landed a threatening letter laced with white powder in Miller’s own mailbox), while titles like Ahmed Rashid’s ""Taliban"" and Yossef Bodansky’s “Bin Laden” started climbing the paperback list.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

It struck me that the press and the public generally reserve the ‘mixed race’ label for the offspring of racially mixed marriages. But there is a paradox here. Obama, half black and half white, is, genetically speaking, not much whiter than I am, even though my nearest white forebears were Virginia slave owners who lived and died in the 19th century.

But Hanratty says that Vibskov’s “wildy inventive talents” extend far beyond just clothing. “I have always had such a love for his work, but even more because of his varied interests and artistic nature,” says Hanratty of the established artist whose autumn-winter 2009 show featured models donning oversize Amish hats while powering black and white striped, human-size hamster wheels in an echoing warehouse outside of Copenhagen. His collection was called Human Laundry. “He is an interdisciplinarian and renaissance man in the truest sense,” Hanratty says. Vibskov also drums for the Danish electro outfit Trentemoller. His new unisex fragrance line, which will be introduced during New York Fashion Week, is called Type. “It reflects geographical locale rather than specific mood,” says Hanratty of the three scents, each called Type A, B and C. “I knew, given his varied interests, that I would get a very atypical selection.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/the-jam-henrik-vibskov/

Matthew Vaughn directed; with Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne and Oliver Platt. “Like ‘Mad Men,’ this new ‘X-Men’ indulges in period nostalgia as it gazes into the future, using the backdrop of the cold war (and its turtlenecks) to explore how the past informs the present (while also blowing stuff up),” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in June.

2011-09-05,Reaching the Heights,"To get pictures like the ones in this week’s cover story — a photo portfolio of ironworkers 70-plus stories off the ground at One World Trade Center — you have to do more than ride a couple hoists, climb a couple flights of temporary stairs and then open the camera shutter. You have to decide a year earlier that you want to get to the top, and then spend months persuading the Port Authority to let you do so. Then your photographer has to take two five-hour Occupational Safety and Health Administration classes devoted to construction-site safety, and a four-hour fall safety-awareness class. (Otherwise, how would you know that you really don’t want to be tethered to anything that can’t hold at least 10 times your weight? Because falling has the effect of making you heavier.) Finally, you have to go back-and-forth with the Port Authority for days to make sure you’re on the building at the very beginning of a new two-floors-per-fortnight cycle, before the safety “cocoon” goes up, so your photographer can get the best possible views of the ironworkers against the skyline.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/reaching-the-heights/

2011-09-05,Variety: Split Ends,"SECOND SUNDAY PUZZLE —There’s an old story that goes something like this: When Carl Gauss, a German mathematician, was still a child prodigy blazing his way through school, his teacher assigned the class the tedious task of counting up all the numbers from 1 to 100. While his classmates began the timely process of adding up the numbers sequentially, the young wunderkind thought of a shortcut and arrived at the answer in a snap. What the young Gauss did was work from the outside in: he knew there were 50 pairs of numbers that added up to 100 (0+100, 1+99 etc. through 49+51), and that 50 times 100 is 5,000. Then he simply tacked on the middle 50 and announced to the class that the grand total was 5,050 — astounding his teacher and probably making him the target of more than a few wet-Wilhelms.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/variety-split-ends/

But Lindsay Degen, the Brooklyn-based 23-year-old behind the new hand-knit sock and lingerie line Degen, is a different sort of designer. Growing up in the suburban Midwest, she dabbled in cheerleading and Girl Scouting before going on to study fine art at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she joined a performance group called Knitting Nation that practiced endurance-building marathon stitch training. Soon, Degen says, “a hobby turned into a job,” and she started collaborating with brands like VPL, Cooperative Designs and Mischa Lampert. “Knitting for people who see fashion and art as equals bent my previous view that they had to be separate worlds,” she says. Indeed, Degen the line, which makes its debut during Fashion Week, is a clever blend of the two; the stripy, woven lingerie and cheerful one-off socks featured are just conceptual enough. “I’ve never wanted to buy a matching pair of anything,” Degen says about offering singles instead of matching socks. “Plus, when I spend eight hours knitting one, it’s dreadful to think that I’d have to spend another eight hours making the exact same thing.” Restless and inspired, she confesses she’s already in need of a new hobby.

A pleasant dissonance arises when he opens his mouth, and from his slight body emerges a deep, rich sound. His barked out lyrics are first person and loop through cryptic, emotionally raw experiences. A dubstep influence is there, but mostly in his modern sensibility as his music is guitar-anchored. For the last year or two, Marshall has played around Britain under the name Zoo Kid, heading to gigs after school, on weekends and over holidays. This past July he played under his new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in Hyères, France. With his second release due out in October, his seriousness is a welcome counterweight to the YouTube-driven fame of his contemporaries like Justin Bieber and Cody Simpson. “Teenager” need not be pejorative when it comes to lyricism.

Bush tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our “values,” and the “war against terror” was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administration’s epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That America’s actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld).

Last week, the show’s creator and executive producer, Kurt Sutter, announced on his blog that if the Season 4 premiere was up more than 10 percent in both major ratings categories over last season’s premiere, he would award one of his more than 54,000  Twitter followers and one reader of his blog with a trip to Los Angeles, where the two lucky scion anarchists will be invited to a viewing party at Mr. Sutter’s home. With a gain of 19 percent in total viewers and 17 percent in the 18-to-49 category compared to the Season 3 debut episode, Mr. Sutter will have to make good on his offer.

For now, though, you could argue that the events of 9/11 still seem so unfathomable that they have actually impoverished the language a little, leaving us with a vacuous phrase like war on terror, which manages to empty both “war” and “terror” of much their meaning, or the creepy, Nazi-sounding homeland, which seems a far less pleasant place to live than just plain America.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/us/sept-11-reckoning/lexicon.html

2011-09-08,His Highnesses,"“I love brands that have a niche, something that they do incredibly well time and time again,” says the designer Wes Gordon. For Gordon, few fit this description better than Manolo Blahnik. “What I love about Manolo is that they’ve been making the same consistently beautiful shoes for as long as they’ve been in business,” says Gordon. “No one nails the timeless, forever-feminine aesthetic quite like them. This praise explains his excitement about collaborating with the Italian shoe company for his spring presentation, taking place on Thursday at the Hosfelt Gallery in Chelsea. Using elements of Manolo’s existing vocabulary  — a heel here, a strap there — Gordon designed two different shoes for the show, an updated Mary Jane for day and a streamlined, stacked-heel sandal for night. “It was something of Manolo Legos,” the designer says of the process. “The look is very Gwyneth from ‘Great Expectations.’ Clean ’90s minimalism done in a very luxe way.” Expect timeless silhouettes done in surprising fabrications, like Lurex and stretch tulle. “So many shoes out there are very aggressive or very cool, and make a statement. But I think at the end of the day what a woman wants is something really sexy, beautiful and clean.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/his-highnesses/

2011-09-08,Hello! Matt Stone and Trey Parker Crash a Class at N.Y.U.,"It turns out a Tony Award really can get you in anywhere. Having run the table at the Tonys in June with their hit musical, “The Book of Mormon,” the “South Park” co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker were back in New York on Tuesday, where they showed up as instructors at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. Approximately 25 freshmen who perhaps expected to doze their way through the first day of a “Storytelling Strategies” course were instead treated to a surprise visit by Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker, who discussed the creation of projects including “South Park,” “Team America: World Police” and “The Book of Mormon.” (Among the nuggets of wisdom offered by Mr. Parker, a self-confessed addict of the Food Network, was to not use too many ingredients in your writing: “Get one piece of salmon and cook it just right,” he said. “Boil it down to one thing.”)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/hello-matt-stone-and-trey-parker-crash-a-class-at-n-y-u/

2011-09-08,The Rick Perry Experiment,"Under the traditional rules of American politics, last night was a very bad night for Texas Governor Rick Perry. In his debut debate, his first introduction to a national audience, he found himself first explaining and then doubling down on his description of  Social Security as a “Ponzi scheme,” with a few references to the “monstrous lie” of its long-term promises thrown in for good measure. It was precisely the kind of moment that the Romney campaign must have been hoping for, and thanks to the moderators’ questions and Perry’s answers, it fell into Romney’s lap without him having to even raise the issue. As soon as the exchange happened, a Romney adviser e-mailed Politico’s Ben Smith: “[Perry] has lost. No federal candidate has ever won on the Perry program to kill Social Security. Never has. never will.” That’s spin, yes, but I’m sure the Romney people believe the basic premise. As well they should. Everything we know about American voters — and yes, Republican primary voters very much included — suggests that Perry’s comments will eventually be deadly to his electoral prospects.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/the-rick-perry-experiment/

When she went back to look for it some 20 minutes later, it was still there. “That’s scary!” Liden exclaimed the other morning, sitting at a table at Karma, Brendan Dugan’s bookshop and design studio on Downing Street in the West Village. The New York Liden lays bare in her new book, “Out of My Mind … Back in 5 Minutes,” is not the sort of place you’d want to leave your personal belongings unattended. Trash bags pile up in the streets like body bags, a slick of dark liquid might be oil or it might be blood, even a rock in central park has the menacing look of a giant, gaunt-eyed skull. This is, of course, all a lot funnier than it sounds. The book is compiled from images swiped from the Internet, photos taken with a BlackBerry and installation shots from Liden’s recent shows at Maccarone and Salon 94 including a series of self-portraits in which she wore various plastic deli shopping bags. A recurring chorus of slogans appropriated from souvenir T-shirts delivers the punchline. “Of all the things I’ve lost, I miss my mind the most.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/lost-found-hanna-liden-at-karma/

After losing the finals of the U.S. Championships in 1919 to Johnston, Tilden realized that he would never beat him until he found an answer to Johnston’s forehand drive to his own slice backhand. Tilden took the entire winter off to develop a backhand that he could hit flat, with top spin or with slice. Many consider it the finest stroke in tennis history. In 1920 he defeated Johnston in five sets in the U.S. Championships and never lost another important match to him. I often wonder why today’s pros don’t do the same thing. It’s pretty clear that Djokovic has come up with a stylistic advantage over Nadal (similar to what Nadal has over Federer). It is a cliché to say that the mental part of the game determines rivalries when style of play is significantly more important. Looking back over the past 10 years of men’s tennis, you have to wonder: if Andy Roddick had been willing to make the changes to his game to beat Federer, would we be talking about the great Roddick-Federer rivalry?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/magazine/reply-all-strung-together.html
2011-09-09,Manufacturing,"Reading Jon Gertner’s article reminded me of industrial-policy talks I participated in as a State Department official in the mid-’80s between U.S. and Japanese officials. We aired our complaints about their aid to business; the Japanese responded that we also backed industry with R&D tax credits and Darpa subsidies, among many programs. At the conclusion of our meetings, the head of the Japanese delegation aptly summed up as follows: “We in Japan have an industrial policy and won’t admit it; you have an industrial policy and don’t know it.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/magazine/reply-all-manufacturing.html
2011-09-09,The Losing Ticket,"Many state lotteries (some of which have hired me as a consultant) continue to sell scratch-off lottery tickets regardless of whether the winning tickets have already been claimed.

2011-09-09,Asking Candidates About Their Faith,"I agree with Bill Keller that we must overcome our squeamishness about asking candidates how spiritual beliefs would inform their governance. I too remember the controversy surrounding John Kennedy, then a candidate, and his Catholicism. Today this attitude seems antiquated, ridiculous. But had he sought the pope’s endorsement or sponsored a prayer rally hosted by Catholic bishops, it would have been a different matter. Who knows whether Rick Perry believes the radical ideas of the leaders featured in the Response rally. The fact that he chose representatives from movements that are antigay, anti-Muslim, anti-Buddhist, antichoice, who believe that foreign policy toward Israel and the Middle East should be determined by religious beliefs, is troubling. Would these ideas affect his political decisions? Would he appoint people with such beliefs to his administration?

2011-09-09,"In New Sitcoms, Parents Need the Growing Up","When I was 33 and single, I moved in next door to a family who threw big parties throughout the summer. There seemed to be an inflatable jumpy castle in their front yard almost every weekend: an enormous, unsightly purple or red or orange blob that would quiver and wobble as little kids and big kids shrieked and giggled and barely missed injuring one another inside. I tried to ignore it, but the thing was just a few feet from my bedroom window, and the racket would go on way past a reasonable hour. Screaming, laughter, sobbing; the jumpy castle boiled life down to its essential elements. And every now and then, one of the smaller kids would roll right out onto the grass, like a baby tumbling out of a gigantic, shaking womb.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/magazine/in-new-sitcoms-parents-need-the-growing-up.html

The profane poetry of abuse — “I can kill you from a sitting position!”; “You always giggle falsely” — was shared with friends on cassettes, heralded by fanzines, sampled on a radio show, adapted by comic-book artists and distributed on CD under the title “Shut Up, Little Man!,” a reference to Mr. Haskett’s favorite put-down. Artists like Kurt Cobain expressed their appreciation; movie producers plotted deals; and a play about the bickering roommates was produced. But, while their private conflicts were played and replayed, first Mr. Huffman and then Mr. Haskett died, with only Mr. Haskett learning about the fuss near the end.

The areas hardest hit are Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, the Guangxi Autonomous Region and the dense municipality of Chongqing. About 14 million acres of farmland across China have been affected, Xinhua reported.

He is our intellectual omnivore, exhilarating and infuriating, if not in equal parts at least with equal wit. He has been rather famously an aggressive critic of God and his followers, after cutting his sacrilegious teeth on Mother Teresa. He wrote a deadpan argument for trying Henry Kissinger as a war criminal, then was branded an apostate by former friends on the left for vigorously supporting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. (He memorably — a lot of what Hitchens has written merits the adverb — shot back that his antiwar critics were “the sort who, discovering a viper in the bed of their child, would place the first call to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.”) And he is dying of esophageal cancer, a fact he has faced with exceptional aplomb.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/arguably-essays-by-christopher-hitchens-book-review.html

Soon, he was on his way back to the area to report on the revolts in Egypt, Libya and Yemen for The Times Magazine, where he is now a staff writer. “Covering the Arab uprisings,” he told us, “has been a transforming experience. By the end of last year, after more than seven years in the region, I had become a dour cynic about the potential for change in the Arab world. I had covered far too many bombings and fraudulent elections, and heard Arabs themselves complain too often about their own inability to transcend the morass of corruption and thuggery.

But a darker corollary soon arose. Why did it take so long? Why did the earlier rebellions fail? And how much damage has been done to the fabric of the societies that are now struggling, at the cost of so much blood, to reinvent themselves? For Western readers, what often seemed lacking — as in Iraq in years past — was an authentic interpreter and witness, someone who could speak across cultures and make us feel the abundant miseries that fueled the revolt.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/anatomy-of-a-disappearance-by-hisham-matar-book-review.html

2011-09-09,The Waning Appeal of Radical Sheik,"In “The Missing Martyrs,” Charles Kurzman suggests that even before Osama bin Laden was killed, his movement had failed utterly. Al Qaeda’s ideological trademark is to exhort ordinary Muslims to engage in individual acts of violence against those deemed enemies of Islam, specifically Americans, Jews and the infidel rulers of Muslim-­majority states. And yet very few such attacks have occurred in the United States since Sept. 11, and certainly none comparable to the devastating events of that day. To emphasize just how surprising this is, Kurzman cites a 2006 online manual for aspiring jihadists that lists 14 “simple tools” that “are easy to use and available for anyone who wants to fight the occupying enemy” — they include “running over someone with a car” and “setting fire to homes or rooms at sleep time.” Kurzman, a sociologist who has written widely about Islamic reform movements, asks: “If terrorist methods are as widely available as automobiles, why are there so few Islamist terrorists? In light of the death and devastation that terrorists have wrought, the question may seem absurd. But if there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why don’t we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/the-missing-martyrs-by-charles-kurzman-book-review.html
2011-09-09,What Do Egypt’s Writers Do Now?,"The Egyptian revolution is over, the army wields power and the new government is in disarray. Tensions between Christians and Muslims are ascendant and members of the elite are leaving the country in droves while those who remain bemoan the masses as ignorant ideologues. This is the Egypt of Waguih Ghali’s “Beer in the Snooker Club,” a coming-of-age novel set in 1952 that, much like “The Catcher in the Rye” in America, articulated the identity crisis of a generation. Ghali’s characters — young, precocious, cosmopolitan — are lost in the bewildering aftermath of the military coup that overthrew the pliant boy-king Farouk. They pine for the easeful gambling, womanizing and drinking of the past even as they scorn both the ancien régime’s sordid pretensions and the new regime’s inability to deliver on its vaulted promises; “We have the worst of both systems,” one of them declares, exasperated. Ghali, who published his novel in 1964 and committed suicide five years later in the bathtub of his British editor’s Primrose Hill apartment, took the fall of the monarchy as his subject. Still, his tale presents uncanny parallels to today’s Egypt, where artists, intellectuals and youth at large are beginning to fashion a new cultural republic of sorts even as they also struggle to find their bearings.

2011-09-09,Brooklyn by the Book,"Late in “Literary Brooklyn,” Evan Hughes quotes the opening words of a Paul Auster novel: “The address is unimportant. But let’s say Brooklyn Heights, for the sake of argument.” For Hughes, the address is terrifically important, as he charts New York’s most-­populated but (his description) “less exceptional” borough. We learn which writers lived where, which were neighbors or enemies; which houses no longer stand and which are now worth $18 million. Meanwhile, the argument that emerges, recedes, rallies and falters throughout is that Brooklyn, because more human in scale, is more American than Manhattan and has particular stories to tell about the rest of the land.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/literary-brooklyn-by-evan-hughes-book-review.html

For Patricia Bosworth, a biographer of Montgomery Clift, this moment came in 2003, when she was invited to a weeklong respite at the 2,500-acre ranch in New Mexico that Ted Turner had bestowed on Jane Fonda as “a divorce present.” Fonda, with her breast implants newly removed and her shapely legs encased in terrific bluejeans (“I have 50 pairs,” she explained), plied Bosworth, a friend from the Actors Studio in the 1960s who had profiled her for magazines over the years, with red wine in enormous goblets, showed off her man-made lake stocked with fish, and introduced her to her six horses, including a white stallion purchased from Mike Nichols, and a golden retriever, a gift from Larry David.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/jane-fonda-the-private-life-of-a-public-woman-by-patricia-bosworth-book-review.html

2011-09-09,Beryl Bainbridge’s Bobby Kennedy Novel,"On May 30, 1888, Anton Chekhov wrote exasperatedly to a friend, the newspaper editor A. S. Suvorin, complaining about the state of contemporary Russian literature, filled with its moral injunctions and its pious prescriptions for human behavior. The writer, he insisted “should not be a judge of his characters or what they say, but an impartial witness. . . . It’s time for writers, especially writers of real artistic worth, to realize . . . that in fact nothing can be understood in this world.” In a real sense, these phrases encapsulate the Chekhovian credo: nothing makes sense, mediocrity is the true demonic force, life is weird and vulgar, judgment is irrelevant. And to many writers, post-Chekhov, this point of view has appeared very attractive. In English literature since World War II, two writers in particular have made this take on life and the human predicament their personal forte — Muriel Spark and Beryl Bainbridge. Bainbridge, who died last year, of cancer, at the age of 77, pushed this attitude of amused, quietistic indifference to its ultimate level. Her succession of short novels (17 in all) demonstrates a beguiling relish in people’s fundamental opacity, eccentricity and inability to conform, however hard they may happen to be trying.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/the-girl-in-the-polka-dot-dress-by-beryl-bainbridge-book-review.html

(Marilyn Stasio reviews it in the Sept. 18 issue of the Book Review.) Penny, a former CBC radio host who turned to writing as a second career, said she gets most of her ideas as she drives around in her 2006 powder blue Volkswagen Beetle convertible. The best thing about the car, she said, is the color. “The salesman was going on and on — it has this feature, it has that feature, and all I’m trying to say is, ‘What color is it?

2011-09-12,Backstage Beauty Report | Rag & Bone,"“It was really embarrassing,” said Revlon’s Global Artistic Director, Gucci Westman, dressed in a tweed aqua blazer, baggy white pants and leopard slippers backstage at Rag & Bone. “My husband (Rag & Bone designer David Neville) called and said, ‘Where are you? We need the turquoise trousers for the show.'” By accident, Westman had selected a look that made it into the final collection, instead of an edit, to wear today, a mistake that was quickly corrected. “It’s the strongest Spring, yet,” she said explaining her excitement at the ’70s surf vacation and 90s rave culture-inspired pieces. She chose a minimal makeup look, so as not to compete with the bright colors of the clothes. Eyes were simply taupe Revlon 16H shadow in Addictive with a touch of Sueded Brow liner. Cheeks were tinted with a light bronzer and blush in Tawny Peach while lips were pale pink, coated with shine and patted with powder. “Personally, I don’t think lip gloss is cool.” What is cool– and consistently Rag & Bone– appears to be grey nails. Jin Soon Choi took last season’s slate to a lighter shade of concrete- Revlon’s Smoky Canvas or Hazy. As for hair, Guido Palau admitted the idea was “effortless,” though the process was anything but. “Eighty percent of the New York designers want ease. It always looks glamorous,” he said. To achieve this, Palau tightly braided the underside of the models’ hair and then added extensions for length to create the illusion of fineness. He then used Redken Satinwear all over damp hair which he dried with a Mason Pearson brush and Sultra tools. The hair was then clamped at the neck with a Velcro strap to create a bob-like effect. Ah, this explains the rave reference.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/backstage-beauty-report-rag-bone/

2011-09-12,Backstage Beauty Report | Mandy Coon,"“We usually have a strong beauty concept,” said the stylist Natasha Royt backstage at Mandy Coon. “This time it’s modern, approachable, realistic, low maintenance– cool. We want to let the graphic, modern clothes speak for themselves.” Last season’s wig-wrapped hair and black, fringed, pastel falls turned into “effortless glamour” this season, according to Rolando Beauchamp. Loose waves came by way of Bumble + Bumble Gel, a blow dry, and then a one-inch curling iron wrapped at the shaft of the hair, all set with Bumble + Bumble Grooming Creme and roughed up with BB Texture for a messy, matte finish. The last step ensured that nothing was “too pretty or too shiny.” Coon’s color-blocked looks were translated into Mark Rothko-inspired, multi-step eyes at the hands of the makeup artist Francelle Daly for NARS. Lavender-grey Lhasa was the primary shadow. “I’m obsessed with this shade,” Daly said. “It’s rarely used for spring/summer collections.” She also added a trio of pinks with an icy tone at both corners of the eye. The Rue Bonaparte Larger Than Life Eyeliner pencil, a natural beige, was used to neutralize under the eye while white Santa Monica Boulevard lined inside. Madison Avenue grey was drawn as triangles on the outer edge of the lid. Without mascara on the bottom lashes, this all contributed to a “special effect” accompanied by a raspberry lip. An effect that caused one model to comment, “I look like I’ve been crying.” Her friend countered, “No, you look beautiful.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/backstage-beauty-report-mandy-coon/

2011-09-12,Runway Grooming Report | Antonio Azzuolo,"Unlike some creatives who choke under pressure, the menswear designer Antonio Azzuolo, a finalist for this year’s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, gracefully eased the reins and took a more relaxed approach to his Spring/Summer collection. Mr. Azzuolo explained backstage, “My first collection was very formal, all about suits. This season I designed more liberally, drawing inspiration from Les Minets, a French/British hybrid movement of mod culture. These young men shunned bourgeois culture, but still dressed up. They were rough and rebellious, but chic and sophisticated as well.” Noting the designer’s departure from his norm of neat, the hairstylist Andre Rodman casually styled models’ hair with his hands and a healthy dollop of Shu Uemura Shape Paste, to enhance each guy’s individual hair texture. Mr. Rodman completed looks with a brisk shake of the dryer, along with “lots of Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray, for a subtly messy, matte look.” The makeup artist Gregory Arlt paired hair and clothes with M.A.C. products that conveyed, “Healthy tired. It might sound strange, but we imagined the guys looking warm and attractive, despite their penchant for partying.” Using just moisturizer (as opposed to foundation) for a base, Arlt slathered onto the models’ faces a yet to be released product from M.A.C.- Mineralize Charged Water Moisture Gel (hitting shelves this December). Brows were then defined and filled in with Kid eyeshadow, while lips were smoothed with lip conditioner. Lastly, he dotted on Select Moisturecover Concealer as necessary, so models looked “handsome, even after that long night out.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/runway-grooming-report-antonio-azzuolo/

2011-09-12,Backstage Beauty Report | Alexander Wang,"Backstage at Alexander Wang, 3:30 pm: Liya Kebede, in black jeans and Doc Martens, is having her hair examined by Guido Palau’s team. Nearby, Frankie Rayder is pulling on a black and red plaid lumberjack shirt over the plastic-bag poncho she’s wearing around her neck. It’s a makeshift protective cover for hair damp with product and oil. Like the look at Helmut Lang earlier today, the mandate is “wet,” but Alexander Wang-style, which translates into Palau using Redken’s Full Frame 07 All Over Volume Mousse to coat the head and then finishing off with Argan-6 oil right before the girls go out. “To get a glint in the hair,” is how Mr. Palau explained the addition of the multipurpose product. He is also adding extensions where needed and uses his Sultra curling iron for a little movement. With prints hitting the collection this season, Mr. Palau wanted to be sure the hair was edgy. “Pulled back can look too pretty,” he said, explaining the switch from last season’s low ponytail. “Today she’s let her hair down.” Both Mr. Palau and Diane Kendal agree that Mr. Wang has a very specific vision for his woman. She’s cool, downtown, beautiful and raw, as Ms. Kendal sees it. For makeup, this means M.A.C.’s black kohl pencil blended out around the eye and then removed with M.A.C. studio moisturizer and a cotton swab, only to be reapplied thereafter. There’s nothing on the face or lip. Nails are painted with Sally Hansen’s natural Parchment. Ms. Kendal has done this look before circa 1990. “Calvin went there,” she said before also calling out Helmut Lang. No doubt Mr. Wang remembers this girl and is now making her his own.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/backstage-beauty-report-alexander-wang/

Snyder was very eager to talk about the initiative he’d embarked upon to install solar panels atop FedEx field. He sent assistants scurrying about to bring in renderings of what the field will look like after NRG, the energy company, installs them. (NRG gets some very prominent signage at FedEx  for its efforts.) He seemed less eager to discuss the general antipathy that has greeted his ownership from the media, fans and even a beloved Redskins Hall of Fame Running back. Throughout the interview, he kept glancing uncomfortably at Tony Wyllie, the Redskins’ head of communications, who was sitting in.

Organized by David van der Leer, the museum’s associate curator in architecture and urban studies, and Sarah Malaika, a project associate, “To a Great City” is a collaboration between the Estonian composer Arvo Part and the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta. It creates urban soundscapes in five downtown locations that, according to the museum’s press release, “quietly celebrate the city, 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks.” The locations include a green labyrinth created by the Battery Conservancy, an underground chamber at the Governors Island National Monument, and spaces in landmark skyscrapers that are normally inaccessible to the public. For a $10 admission fee, visitors will be given a map, directions and a one-day pass to each of the “stillspots” for a self-guided tour, which takes about three hours; reservations are recommended. In conjunction with the project, visitors can identify and map their own favorite quiet spots as part of “Create Your Own Stillspot” at stillspotting.guggenheim.org.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/now-listening-stillspotting/

Surprisingly, it wasn’t the ’60s that inspired the up-do that Pita referred to as “Kim Novak-y,” rather Von Furstenberg’s starting point for the collection: “New Beginnings.” For makeup, this meant James Kaliardos used M.A.C. products for a face inspired by the land where it all began: Africa. The idea was to highlight the planes and tones of the face using an earthy (literally) palette of eight Crème Color Base shades, including Ochre, Pale Peach and Dark Brown. The inner and outer corner of the eye was highlighted with a khaki variation, while the middle of the lid was done in white or yellow. There was no lip, just as nails were kept clean, coated with only Sally Hansen’s Hard as Nails. Kaliardos described the ingenuity of the woman who inspired him, “No matter her economic situation, she finds a way to look beautiful— regal even.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/backstage-beauty-report-diane-von-furstenberg/

On Monday, production began on “Quartet,” Mr. Hoffman’s feature-directing debut, its press representatives announced. The film, which is expected to shoot for nine weeks in Buckinghamshire, England, stars Tom Courtenay (whose previous films include “Doctor Zhivago” in 1965), Billy Connolly (“Mrs. Brown”) and Pauline Collins (“Shirley Valentine”) as residents of a home for retired opera singers. Their annual plans for a fund-raising concert, held on Verdi’s birthday, are disrupted by the arrival of a down-on-her-luck grande dame (played by Maggie Smith, the “Downton Abbey,” “Gosford Park” and “Harry Potter” star). The screenplay for “Quartet” is by Ronald Harwood, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of “The Pianist” and “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” and adapted from his play of the same title. Mr. Hoffman is also a producer on the film, which is financed by BBC Films, DCM Productions and Decca.

2011-09-12,Backstage Beauty Report | Derek Lam,"It was the architect Richard Neutra’s rigorous West Coast houses that inspired the beauty look at Derek Lam — that and the color yellow. Both may be odd inspirations for hair and makeup, but that’s what makes them so welcome. Better yellow and geometry than another repeat reference, though the look wasn’t totally different from last time around. “This collection’s an evolution from last season, not a complete change,” Orlando Pita said. “The hair has that feeling too.” This meant a low side-parted ponytail instead of hair pulled back at the crown without a visible barrette. “Clean, simple lines,” is how Pita described the look he created using Phyto Volume Active Mousse, blow drying with a T3 featherweight Luxe, then sealing the ends with Phyto 7 and a T3 Single Pass iron. The hair was then scraped back into a ponytail with a part over the right eye. Pita used Phyto Finishing Spray and a little Shine Defining Wax to ”make it perfectly done.” Nails were painted Estée Lauder’s Nude Attitude, but it was the eyes that went a little wild. Tom Pecheux (Estée Lauder’s creative makeup director) explained the Neutra connection by making references to large windows that “let the outdoor weather into the house,” which became a ray of yellow from Estée Lauder Rain Boots shadow on the lid highlighted with Cyber Copper brown shimmer all the way to the brow bone. Citron Kiss lip gloss was the final step. Canary colored in the vial, it’s the perfect way to warm up another lip color or let the light in for spring.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/backstage-beauty-report-derek-lam/

Because Tommy does that healthy, American girl with bouncy hair, and I’m doing something very clean, very sharp, and very chic.” This shift from previous seasons (it was Souleiman who was behind those healthy, bouncy heads of hair at the fall 2011 show) was implemented through flat ironing strands with the help of Wella’s Shine Finish, which he called “liquid gold,” then tucking hair back behind the ears before pulling it into a low ponytail tied with a thin black elastic. To achieve a graphic but not hard, product-y look, Souleiman squirted a bit of Wella Professionals Stay Essential Finishing Spray on a brush blush before running it over the surface of the hair to smooth down flyaways. As it turns out, it takes almost as much work to not reinvent the wheel as it does to invent it; as he noted, “It’s so easy to do something really wacky — I could do that with my eyes shut.

The golden ratio or phi (1.61803…) is a fascinating number that we have explored before in the puzzles, Moonlighting Triangles and The Golden Ratio Treasure. The ratio, which is approached to greater and greater precision by two adjacent numbers of the related Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…), has become part of popular culture, attaining almost mystical status. Images and video clips like the one above abound on the Internet, connecting the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence with art, architecture, cosmology, biology, aesthetics, poetry, music and many other fields. But how much of all this is true and how much is myth? Professor Devlin, who recently published a scholarly book titled The Man of Numbers: Fibonacci’s Arithmetic Revolution, examined the evidence with a scientific eye and separated the wheat from the chaff.

But there’s something more systematic to the macro story – something that very much informs my work. Namely, “old Keynesian” and “new Keynesian” models represent two intelligent but imperfect responses to the problem of thinking about an economy in which people must make future-oriented decisions. Neither is fully convincing, but there are no better alternatives at this point. So what I do, and I hope others do as well, is to think about policy issues both ways, and try to “bracket” things in a way that leads to reasonably secure conclusions.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/how-much-hoc-to-add-wonkish-and-methodological/

Together they emote this heat,” Zilberman said of the lineup of 16 bronzed models wearing lingerie, red socks and sandals. Kaneko used minimal makeup on the face, simply M.A.C.’s tawny brown Photo lipstick with a touch of gloss, and focused instead on creating glowing skin with Studio Sculpt in a variety of shades.

Bush, Barack Obama and Hu Jintao of China. That’s just a guess, but we can tell you for certain that the original “Point Break” was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the future Academy Award-winning director of “The Hurt Locker,” and starred Keanu Reeves as a young F.B.I. agent on the trail of the “Ex-Presidents” gang, whose philosophical leader is played by Patrick Swayze. The new version was announced late Monday by Alcon Entertainment, a production and finance company based at Warner Brothers, which has been on a rebooting binge; last month the company announced that it was producing a new “Blade Runner” film that could serve as a sequel or prequel to Ridley Scott’s original movie.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/see-you-in-the-next-life-point-break-is-hollywoods-latest-planned-remake/

In the end, Palau came up with a half pulled-through ponytail created by first blow-drying the hair with Redken Satinwear, then pulling it back with an elastic. The next step was attaching the tail to the back of the head with a silver Goody clip and coating the hair with Shine Enrich and Forceful 23 Spray. “A little bit spiky — aerodynamic,” is how Palau described the finished look. Nails were painted Zoya’s Olivia with a custom matte top coat to make a nude velvet effect. For makeup, Dick Page conceived what he referred to as the appropriately collegiate “Pretty 101, just a healthy face.” This was done using Shiseido gold blush dusted just above the cheek bones with a rosy tone below. Eyelids were spread with Shiseido Maquillage Lip Gloss and brows were colored with Shimmering Cream eyeshadow in one of four shades: Sable, Gold Meadow, Caviar or Leather, a reddish brown for those with auburn hair. Roseate was dabbed onto the bare mouth with the finger.

2011-09-13,Backstage Beauty Report | Rodarte,"Backstage at Rodarte, James Kaliardos was touching up Kate Mulleavy’s makeup while one of his assistants prepped the model Samantha Gradoville (wearing her own webby, iridescent knit) nearby. Odile Gilbert was on the other side of the space getting girls ready for what she calls the “Sweet 16,” an off-center part with a natural wave and one side twisted up and tucked in with a comb. “Soft, innocent — not pretentious,” she said of the style created with Kérastase Volume Active Mousse and Double Force hairspray. “It looks easy, but it’s not easy.” Deborah Lippman painted toes Fashion, her opaque beige, and fingers a custom variation of Lady Sings the Blues. The Mulleavy sisters asked her to up the amount of large graphite glitter in the polish rather than the standard mix of paillettes. Like Lippman, Kaliardos channeled Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” with dark navy, shimmering eyes. Using Nars products, he drew all over lids with the shadow pencil in Dark Night and then added Night Flight and Tropic, a turquoise glitter. “Looks a bit like Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream,'” Kaliardos said laughing as he moved on from Van Gogh. Penny Lane cream blush was used high on the cheeks and to cover the lips, which were then coated with Pearl Beach eyeshadow and Na Na gloss. “Dreamy and aggressive at the same time,” he said. “A cool, ethereal girl.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/backstage-beauty-report-rodarte/

A young man in a tank top and a baseball cap strolls into the melee. In the time it takes for the excited voices behind the cellphone camera to realize that this movie starlike good Samaritan is in fact “the guy from the movie — ‘The Notebook’ ” he has somehow orchestrated a cease-fire.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/movies/ryan-gosling-and-ides-of-march.html

On the discussion boards of UrbanBaby.com, worked-up moms from the Upper East Side argue over whether Riverdale sends enough seniors to Harvard, Yale and Princeton to be considered truly “TT” (top-tier, in UrbanBabyese), or whether it is more accurately labeled “2T” (second-tier), but it is, certainly, part of the city’s private-school elite, a place members of the establishment send their kids to learn to be members of the establishment.

Since the opening of Adnan Kazmaoglu’s austerely geometric Yesil Vadi Mosque in Istanbul last year, a design and architecture movement is sweeping through the city. Salt’s Beyoglu building, a columned space by the local architect Han Tumertekin on the boulevard Istiklal, features the work of a different Turkish designer in each room — there’s a cinema by Hakan Demirel, a bookstore by Omer Unal and a cafe by Ali Selcuk and the chef Murat Bozok.

2011-09-14,Backstage Beauty Report | Michael Kors,"“Michael loves a bronze girl or boy,” said Dick Page backstage at Michael Kors. “This is a sort of rough glamor.” Page used Shiseido Creme Shadow in Caviar, Leather and Sable to create strong eyebrows with Meadow gold spread on the lid and Caramel Perfect Rouge on the lips. Luminize Satin Face Color in BE 206 was mixed with Bronzer 1 and 2 all over the face to make sure the models “didn’t look like they had to get up at 6 a.m. to do a show.” No one did. “It’s pretty,” Hanne Gaby said of her tousled hair braided with black leather. “I don’t think I’d be able to do it, though.” Luckily, Orlando Pita was there to help create the look that came about based on one of Kors’s fantasy stories. (“He embellished it more than I do,” said Pita of the designer’s storytelling prowess.) The tales goes: These girls are on a trip in Africa with only shoelaces to tie back their hair. “They groom themselves,” said Pita. “The front is all they can see.” This explains why the hair around the face was more tidy, parted in the middle, while the back was wild and messy. Orlando’s own Dry Shampoo was used with Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray to coat the hair before braiding. The tail was then teased up between the lacing and Pita’s Elevate Texture Spray added.

Mr. Mayer wanted to rewrite the book and to transform its muddled romantic subplot into a love triangle full of dramatic and comic tension. His boldest idea: turning one of the central characters, a flighty woman named Daisy, into a gay florist named David. The gender switch was meant to throw impediments into the main narrative, about a male psychiatrist who hypnotizes Daisy/David and then falls in love with her/his past self, a woman named Melinda Wells.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/theater/new-layers-for-broadway-bound-musical-revivals.html

Mr. Polanski spent several months under house arrest in Gstaad before Swiss prosecutors said they would not extradite him.

2011-09-15,My Three Favorite Journeyman-Athlete Memoirs,"The barrier for entry into the jock memoir genre is, unsurprisingly, pretty low. For every “Open” — Andre Agassi’s much-acclaimed, lovely autobiography — there are a dozen or so books like “Outrageous!,” the decidedly less literary reminiscences of Charles Barkley, in which the author famously claimed he was misquoted. Sure, ghostwriters have something to do with this, but at least “Outrageous!” was about Charles Barkley — a controversial N.B.A. Hall of Famer who played with and against some of the league’s all-time greats. What has always confounded me is the sheer number of ordinary, even journeyman athletes who cash in by documenting their rise to midlevel greatness between hard covers. But since so many of them do it, here are my favorites. (Intentionally missing is Jim Bouton’s totally awesome, gossip-laden “Ball Four.” Though Bouton was the definition of a mediocre player, he remains the Homer of the genre he created.

These were then knotted at the neck and four little strands were pinned to the head as if blown back by a gust of wind. Perhaps in an allusion to the raincoats in the collection, nails were painted a custom blend of CND Raspberry Parfait, Guava and Speedy top coat. Francelle Daly for Nars created what she described as “dewy, fresh, skin” with Radiant Tinted Moisturizer intended to contrast “a edgy, heavy metallic eye.” Night Life shadow was applied in the crease to make a demi lune; underneath it, a hollow of bare skin. The silver Paris Duo was used along the eyebrow and Rue Bonaparte neutral liner in the duct. Not one but six coats of mascara were applied to lashes. “Romantic and rebel,” is how Daly explained this juxtaposition. Lips were covered in concealer and topped with Gaiete blush to create color in a fresh way.

I liked the aquarium lighting, the sawtooth alps forested with black ﬁrs, the compact cities encrusted in dirty Roman esque stucco. Most of all, I liked the place’s wateriness. At forty-seven I felt cracked and dry. My new home territory was as rainy as Ireland, puddled with lakes and veined with big rivers.

The sides were then pressed down with fingers. Campbell finished styles by showering hair with Redken Shine Flash 02 Glistening Mist and Cutler Shine Tattoo for an extreme, wet-looking finish. The makeup artist Yadim kept things aglow by moisturizing with Sisleÿum Global Revitalizer for Men, then tapping Sisley Radiant Immediate Lift on the high planes of the face to highlight.

Six complex but fundamentally decent characters hurt one another and are hurt by forces greater than themselves, whether those forces be the impersonal cruelty of nature’s accidents or the very personal torments of marriage and middle school. The overarching question is whether the members of the Ryrie family will piece themselves together and re-find who they all were during a halcyon vacation eight years past, or whether they will let sorrow, secrets and shame drive them irreparably apart.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/books/review/the-grief-of-others-by-leah-hager-cohen-book-review.html

He is an effete coastal liberal, the kind of person who orders light beer at the local bar and grill, disdains its celebrated fried pickles and tries to pay with a credit card.

The scheme pays homage to Randall Cunningham’s glory days. The Eagles do not really drive down the field; they just string together amazing highlights, interspersing the occasional punt or baffling mistake. A typical play begins with two defenders knifing untouched through Philadelphia’s porous, inexperienced offensive line. Vick either gets flattened or performs some Matrix-style escape, scrambling for a big gain or tossing to a receiver who used the confusion to get wide open. Andy Reid calls for a timeout four or five times per half to impose order (teams only get three timeouts per half, but a 5-yard penalty is a small price to pay for the chance to install a precisely designed sequence of plays for Vick to scrap).",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/week-2-n-f-l-matchups/
2011-09-16,Russian Drama,"After closing its doors in 2005 for a rafters-to-orchestra-pit renovation, Moscow’s Bolshoi Theater still kicked up controversy — embezzlement, corruption, sex scandal. Now, three years past due and way over budget, the hall, which dates to 1825, will reopen next month with a gala performance of the ballet and opera companies’ greatest hits. In attendance will be President Dmitri Medvedev and other heads of state, who will finally see what $760 million restores. It took more than 3,500 workers to restore the Apollo and the Muses ceiling piece, replicate the missing Villeroy & Boch tiles and hang 617 pounds of crystal from the main chandelier. Much of the work was supervised by the president’s office itself, which stepped in when construction faltered in 2009, after a contractor was paid three times for the same work. Now the acoustics are fixed, subterranean hydraulic stages are built, and, for the finishing touch, the Romanov coat of arms has been reinstated above the lintels, in place of the hammer and sickle.

He coated hair with Meta Lush Volumizer and Meta Revive Dry Shampoo before blow-drying and using a small barrel curling iron to create the base for finger waves. Then, the back was swept to the side and tucked into a twist secured with pins. “Sophistication becomes disheveled,” Normant said, using his fingers to pull apart the up do. Nails went the way of the lady, as well. “She wanted something sexy, nothing dark or overpowering of the clothes,” Yuna Park said of Blush, the custom mauve polish she created for Scott to replace last season’s black varnish. “It’s less Gothic, more feminine — not so harsh.” For makeup, Aaron De May translated Scott’s directive with a dense shiny eye, bronzed skin and a subtle lip. “Normally, L’Wren always likes strong, smoky, colorful, this was also about decadence, the duchesses, princesses arriving on boat in the ’40s and ’50s,” he said. De May used Lancôme Star Bronzer  in Solaire to make each girl’s skin color “two tones darker.” He then applied Le Crayon Kohl in Black Coffee all around the eye and in the crease. This was blended with Mochaccino shadow on the top and Vintage Brown on the bottom. He painted the inner corners of the eye gold from the 5 Pan Palette in Gold Frenzy and spread Juicy Tubes Pure clear lip gloss on the lid. “It can look dull or muddy with all that brown,” De May said. “This brings life to the face in need of a little bit of sparkle.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/backstage-beauty-report-lwren-scott/

His desire to create comity is admirable in theory, but compromise for its own sake is neither effective nor politically desirable. Perhaps we on the left misjudged Candidate Obama, but his campaign rhetoric was far more progressive than his presidency has been. We know he’s constrained by the Republican House, though there are areas in which he could achieve change, like closing Guantánamo, protecting whistle-blowers or, most important, withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. He could use ye olde Bully Pulpit to advocate progressive ideals vocally.

It is worth debating whether a visit to this corner ought to be mandated for tourists; few spots so profoundly render the truths of New York’s economic extremism. Liberal parents hoping to foster their own political values in their children might consider pilgrimages.

2011-09-16,"An Essayist in Love with Seattle, Sailing and the Open Road","For the essayist the past is less a foreign country than a home address, a lodestar or touchstone, in Phillip Lopate's words the “Aladdin’s lamp which he or she never tires of rubbing.” It is more markedly so in a collection assembled over time, or in the case of Jonathan Raban, over the two decades this eloquent Englishman has spent in America. Raban presents his selections humbly, mindful of the gap that separates American from British English. “The longer I stay here,” he writes, “the more conscious I am of nuances to which I must still remain deaf.” It is impossible not to take to the author of a book called “Driving Home” who reveals that on his arrival he made the greatest of idiomatic American mistakes: he bought the wrong car. Less than gently, the woman for whom he had crossed the ocean translates. What message does his black Dodge Daytona communicate? “Midlife crisis,” she answers. “Who drives them?” he asks. “Kids. Black teenagers. Gang members,” she replies, crisply. She sounds very much aware that she is interpreting for a man who previously assumed Oregon to be an invention of Bernard Malamud.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/books/review/driving-home-an-american-journey-by-jonathan-raban-book-review.html

The explanations offered for this phenomenon tend to be of two sorts: prurient accounts of black male promiscuity and irresponsibility, or caricatures of aggressive and unreasonable black women.

Perhaps this is why the moment seems to call for nonfiction about India that must match its subject for ambition.

In Wisconsin, labor unions lost their greatest public battle since Ronald Reagan’s showdown with air traffic controllers.

These Titans, written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by George Pérez, become one of DC’s most popular books. The stories reprinted in this omnibus edition chronicle the formation of the team, faceoffs with the assassin Deathstroke and the Fearsome Five, a misguided confrontation with the Justice League and a battle royal against Trigon, a demon who is also Raven’s father. About midway in there is a “day in the life” story that focused on the civilian lives of the heroes.

But now the director of public prosecutions will have to consent before such arrest warrants can be issued.

Turns out the style was to be 40s waves à la Veronica Lake, Ingrid Bergman or Rita Hayworth. This was achieved using Clairol ColorSeal Gloss to prep the hair and then Frédéric Fekkai mousse before blow-drying and creating a low side part. A large-barrel curling iron set the front wave, clamped very tight until the end (“really cooking the hair”), when it was brushed out. For makeup, Val Garland created what she called a “film noir Fellini-flick look”: liquid liner on the top of the lid, a sooty matte on the bottom and M.A.C.’s Carbon shadow in between. M.A.C. Creme Colour Base contoured the face at the corners of the cheeks, the temples, even the cupid’s bow of the lips.

2011-09-19,Asked & Answered | Bruce Jay Friedman,"If there is an advantage to being an underappreciated novelist, it might be that when you get around to writing a memoir, the anecdotes of your life have not already been trotted out ad infinitum by book reviewers the world over. Such is the case with Bruce Jay Friedman, whose memoir, “Lucky Bruce,” will be published next month. On the strength of his early novels — “Stern” (1962), “A Mother’s Kisses” (1964) and “About Harry Towns” (1974) — Friedman was a literary star, frequently mentioned alongside Bernard Malamud and Philip Roth. He hung out at Elaine’s; edited for legendary Magazine Management pulp journals, where he hired Mario Puzo onto the staff of True Action; and, later, moonlighted as a screenwriter (“Stir Crazy,” “Splash”), rubbing shoulders with Warren Beatty and Richard Pryor. Yet Friedman has always remained somewhat under the radar. In “Lucky Bruce,” readers get fresh, amusing stories from Friedman’s life in letters — the time he provoked Norman Mailer into a fistfight by mussing his hair at a party, say, or was hired to write a script and introduced to his new secretary, a between-marriages Natalie Wood. The Moment caught up with Friedman, now 81, at one of his favorite Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, Chin Chin, to talk about his latest book.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/asked-answered-bruce-jay-friedman/

2011-09-19,Vain Glorious | Antonia Burrell,"Though we’d like to believe that there was a magic time between the youthful distress of pimples and the more mature worry of wrinkles, when skin simply behaved, the evidence points increasingly to the contrary. “Just because you’re 35 doesn’t mean you’re not going to have breakouts,” says Antonia Burrell, a straight-talking facialist-turned skin-care guru, whose namesake, all-natural year-old line has a rabid following in her native Britain. The problem, according to Burrell, is our higher levels of exposure to a host of complexion-wrecking factors like stress, pollution and the chemicals and hormones in food. “I’ve been doing this for 18 years and the phenomenon of older women breaking out is not something I would see 10 years ago,” Burrell says. “After having so many clients moan to me about their skin, I decided to do something about it — but I wanted products that were holistic and a pleasure to use, not harsh chemicals that would dry out your skin. And I wanted to make them anti-aging, too.” At Shen Beauty in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the only store in the United States that sells Burrell’s products, her multitasking, plant-extract-packed Cream Supreme moisturizer and deep cleaning Natural Glow Cleansing Oil are perennial best sellers. The co-owner Jessica Richards first tried the line just before the store opened late last year. “My skin was completely broken out from the stress of launching a business, and this cleared it up in, like, three days,” she says. “It’s like a natural version of Proactiv. People cannot get enough of this line.” Burrell’s products are so popular at Shen that hers is among the 12 lines that will be available to order online when the boutique’s retail Web site goes live later this week. Also in the works are plans to get Burrell to Shen sometime this fall so she can work her facial magic on the Brooklyn faithful. For those unwilling to wait, Burrell has a standing gig as a guest facialist at Harrods and also sees clients at the Urban Bliss spa in Notting Hill; appointments can be made through her Web site. But be aware — she’s usually booked three months in advance.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/vain-glorious-antonia-burrell/

2011-09-20,T Exclusive Video | ‘Honey Bunny’ by Girls,"San Franciscans sometimes get a bad rep. On behalf of all of the Bay Area (or so it seems), watch the Girls’ frontman Christopher Owens play about town singing lyrics like, “They don’t like my bony body, they don’t like my dirty hair,” in their new video for the track “Honey Bunny,” off their recently released sophomore album, “Father, Son, Holy Ghost” (True Panther Sounds). Surprisingly, the title of this record, which was released last Tuesday to rave reviews, does not directly refer to Owens’s childhood in the infamous Children of God cult, he said. Instead, the moody album — filled with heavy metal riffs that channel Fleetwood Mac, and light ’60s strumming that brings you back to the Beach Boys, supported by hallowing gospels — reaches down deeper than that: to Owens’s relationship with women, primarily his mother. This record is no doubt less lo-fi than their first, but the straightforward and honest sentiment Owens and the bassist and producer J.R. White bring feels evermore present. Currently on a United States tour, Girls talked to The Moment about their new song “Honey Bunny,” which Owens initially wrote using his cellphone, and the video, imagined by White.

He created loose, tousled strands by prepping with Bumble & Bumble Styling Lotion and then using a large-barrel curling iron. This easy approach was in contrast to the polished 1960s girl of last season — especially when topped off with cheery pompom hats. As for makeup, Wendy Rowe used Burberry Beauty’s new Fresh Glow foundation all over the skin with Russet Blush and Tulip Pink lip color.

2011-09-20,Backstage Beauty Report | Mary Katrantzou,"It took five people to carry the finale dress for Mary Katrantzou backstage before the show, where it was to be sewn onto a model after she was finished with hair and makeup. When it arrived, the full beauty look remained undecided as Val Garland was still mixing M.A.C. pigments to sort out the perfect 10 holographic shades to be painted on lips. “If you look at the clothes, they are all really colorful and energetic,” she said. “Sam [McKnight] did great, sexy hair. It felt right to do a statement, but not makeup makeup.” This meant choosing to do simply a striking mouth to complement the collection. Garland’s been known to go on instinct when it comes to Katrantzou. It was during her first season that Garland decided to change up the makeup hours before the presentation. Twelve girls were sent out with 12 different versions of eyeliner, a look that ended up creating quite a stir. For spring, the bold lip needed little else save for a sheer, sparkling nail (Nailgirls Pink 19) and simple ponytail. “Incredibly naïve, childlike — and clean” is how McKnight described the hair, which was pulled back with pieces pulled out as “a veil all around the hairline, so that it wafts when she moves.” To start, he wanted models to have perfectly washed hair, which was achieved by shampooing and conditioning with Pantene Color Protection products in the bathroom sink. “The loo’s three floors over,” McKnight said. “They were not very happy about that.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/backstage-beauty-report-mary-katrantzou/

Nails, like the hair, were intended to be polished, but discreetly so as not to compete with the bright colors of the clothes. This meant Essie’s Jazz on fingers and toes. Makeup, on the other end, was all about shine. M.A.C. Lustre drops were mixed with Strobe Liquid Lotion and applied all over the body by Adrien Pinault and team.

2011-09-21,And Now a Word From the Director,"IN 1938, a month after the Nazi assault on German Jews known as Kristallnacht made headlines across the world, Walt Disney gave Hitler’s pet filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl, a tour of his studio. He showed her some Mickey Mouse sketches, and she offered to show him “Olympia,” her cinematic slog through the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He turned her down because he was worried it would get out that he was playing host to a woman most of Hollywood shunned. In his biography “Leni” Steven Bach writes that when she returned to Germany, she praised Disney for receiving her, saying, it “was gratifying to learn how thoroughly proper Americans distance themselves from the smear campaigns of the Jews.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/movies/conflicting-voices-in-lars-von-triers-words-and-works.html
2011-09-21,Billy Beane of ‘Moneyball’ Has Given Up on His Own Hollywood Ending,"Billy Beane has a wonderful story. At 18 he was a strapping young baseball prospect, raised in San Diego by a Naval-officer dad and drafted fresh out of high school in the first round by the New York Mets. He was a sure star — until he suddenly wasn’t, his playing career faltering for reasons few could understand, least of all him. Then, at 27, a journeyman outfielder with a lifetime average of .219 who’d bounced from the Mets to the Twins to the Tigers to the A’s, he walked out of the dugout and into the team’s front office, looking for a job. He became a scout, and eight years later, he was promoted to general manager of a losing team. Under his watch, the A’s, a small-market underdog with a minuscule payroll, made the playoffs five times in the next eight seasons.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/magazine/for-billy-beane-winning-isnt-everything.html
2011-09-21,The Surreal Ruins of Qaddafi’s Never-Never Land,"On the evening of Aug. 23, during the final hours of the battle for Tripoli, a 26-year-old lawyer named Mustafa Abdullah Atiri was lying, exhausted, against the back wall of a filthy tin-roofed warehouse crammed with 150 prisoners. He had been beaten and tortured every day since Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s soldiers arrested him four days earlier. It was just after the muezzin’s first call to evening prayer — about 10 minutes before 8 — when a pair of guards walked to the door, raised their AK-47 rifles and began spraying the men with bullets. Another guard threw a grenade into the densely packed crowd. Bodies fell on top of Atiri with the first fusillade, protecting him from the blast. Then the guards opened fire again. Blood began seeping down from the bodies above, soaking his jeans. As the officers walked back across the yard to reload, a guard named Abdel Razaq, who had shown the men some small mercies over the previous days, went to the door and shouted at the survivors: “Run! Run!”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/magazine/the-surreal-ruins-of-qaddafis-never-never-land.html

The deal signed by Turkey’s Prime Minister, Tayyip Erdoðan, and Dervis Eroglu, the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, “takes into account the legitimate, equal and inherent rights of the Turkish Cypriots like those of the Greek Cypriots over the whole continental shelf of the Island,” it said. Turkey has called the search for gas reserves in Eastern Mediterranean by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot state a provocation, when Ankara supports sharing the region’s natural resources equally between the Turkish and Greek communities. The energy reserves in the area have also been explored recently by Israel, which is likely to increase diplomatic and military tensions in the region.

Transplant centers already test both living and dead donors for those diseases, but many centers use an older type of blood test that cannot detect an infection that was acquired very recently. A newer technique, nucleic acid testing, can find infections earlier. For hepatitis C, for instance, the older test cannot detect the disease during the first 70 days after infection. But nucleic acid testing can find it after seven days. The newer test is already used to detect H.I.V. Infections in organ recipients prompted the new recommendations. From 2007 to 2010, the C.D.C. confirmed dozens of cases of hepatitis B and C and H.I.V. caused by transplants; some patients died.

His lawyers, however, say Rajaratnam is a lesser-order felon — “not . . . as culpable as a defendant who affirmatively steals,” as they put it in a pre-sentencing memorandum. The lawyers raise a problem of culture and law: Is insider trading merely an illicit version of a common American cleverness, trading on gossip from a colleague or friend that helps the trader and hurts no one? Or is it the quintessential Wall Street crime, one that has undermined Americans’ faith in the markets?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/magazine/in-the-insider-trading-war-market-beaters-beware.html

As a one-night stand turns into something more, the film explores the notion that to meet someone new, not least a potential partner, is also to rethink who you are, an invitation to shape and refine the self you wish to project. A story about falling in love that is also a tale of identity and self-definition, it is perhaps all the more resonant for taking place between two gay men.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/movies/andrew-haighs-weekend-looks-at-a-gay-couple.html

Milan, on the other hand, has been conspicuously lacking in luxury department stores. But that all changed earlier this month, with the opening earlier of Excelsior, a multilevel shopping destination with a fashion sense that runs the gamut from Dries Van Noten to Balmain (the renowned local boutique owner Antonia Giacinti is a consultant), a trio of restaurants from the local celebrity chef Davide Oldani and departments stocked with everything from retro-fabulous meat slicers to flower arrangements by the edgy florist Numero 9. The former cinema has been reimagined by the architect Jean Nouvel as an ode to the history of film: floors are laid out as parapet balconies, and wraparound L.E.D. screens show a continuous stream of film stills. Even the sales clerks dress the part. The women who work in the cosmetics and fragrance hall on the first floor wear stripy Breton tops, cropped black trousers and ankle-strap heels and the guys who sell men’s clothes on the second floor sport tartan shirts, chinos and solid ties.

2011-09-22,Showing His Mastery Just by Standing Still,"The flamenco dancer Israel Galván combines complete command of his medium with a phenomenally fertile range of off-beat stylistic ideas. He gives you — deliberately — the impression that traditional flamenco is too small to contain all he needs to do in terms of rhythm and drama. You see him suddenly balance on one leg and turn the sole of his raised shoe upward so that he can slap out a beat with his hands; he even taps one percussive phrase on his front teeth. These are gimmicks. As with many of the greatest flamenco dancers, the intensity with which he presents himself is always on the cusp of absurdity. But he makes his effects feel both enjoyable and necessary. They work because they’re part of the witty, odd flamboyance that characterizes his dance theater, but even more because they’re part of the rhythmic outpouring that turns his dance into music. Though he shows that he can do quite an assortment of the foot trillings that abound in flamenco, he refuses to indulge himself in that kind of bravura: he steers clear of flamenco cliché. It’s extremely rare in any genre to see a dancer of this singular imagination and authority. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/arts/dance/flamenco-by-israel-galvan-review.html

Equidistant from Florence and Rome in the bucolic, central Italian region of Umbria, Perugia is an enchanting hilltop city with a compact historic center that is a rambling maze of medieval streets. Although many associate Perugia with the controversial murder trial of the American Amanda Knox, this forward-thinking city maintains a friendly appeal. In 2008, an eco-friendly high-tech light rail line called the MiniMetrò made its debut, zipping visitors into the city center from outer areas and keeping its historic streets mostly car-free. Instead, the streets jam with visitors during two popular annual events: a summer jazz festival that attracts the music world’s biggest acts, and Eurochocolate, a huge autumnal chocolate festival that this year runs Oct. 14 to 23.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/travel/36-hours-in-perugia-italy.html

So the city’s cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, was understandably relieved when the museum’s board voted Wednesday evening to continue as an independent operation. “This is a wonderful outcome,” Ms. Levin said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “It’s great for the institution to be able to keep its mission intact and keep its collection under its own stewardship.” Having been driven by financial straits to default on its construction bonds and sell its building on West 53rd Street, the museum had been considering a transfer of its collections to the Smithsonian along with a possible long-term loan to the Brooklyn Museum. Now, the museum said, it will attempt to move forward in its smaller building in Lincoln Square. The museum was rescued by pledges of donations from its trustees and from the Ford Foundation. The museum would not specify the terms or amounts of these gifts.

He can attract scorn from hundreds of miles away. Everything about Cutler’s career is polarizing: the gaudy statistics that contrast his 35-35 win-loss record; his penchant for turnovers; his snippy, irritable public demeanor; and his career-long association with mercurial offensive masterminds like Mike Shanahan, Josh McDaniels and Mike Martz, who only magnify his peculiar attraction-repulsion effect.Last season’s N.F.C. championship game became Ferris Cutler’s Day Off, with the (somewhat) injured quarterback looking less willing than able on the sideline as his backups got battered by the Packers. It was the type of nonperformance that defines a career, fairly or not, and a win Sunday could deflect a tiny bit of criticism. Unfortunately, Cutler’s Bears are 1-4 against the Packers in the past two seasons, and their offensive line is still bad enough to make even the toughest quarterback consider using a sick day.

2011-09-23,The Iron Lady as Anti-Muse,"In the endlessly popular musical “Billy Elliot,” the villain is played not by an actor but by a larger-than-life puppet with a gigantic head, an effigy of the kind that sometimes still appears at European protest rallies. This one has a beaked nose, a pronounced overbite and upswept blond hair, a visage immediately familiar to anyone who remembers the 1980s, and one that theatergoers — paying $100 a ticket for a dose of solidarity with the beleaguered British proletariat in the age of late capitalism — are eager to boo. “Who was that lady?” one of my children asked as we departed a recent matinee performance, not having recognized the Iron Lady.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/magazine/riff-the-iron-lady-as-anti-muse.html

The tour covered 26 years, including Washington’s installation as the first president. The big theme was that a relatively small number of people in this intensely important area made a crucial difference, not just to the city but to the world. The current architecture is designed to be tall.

2011-09-23,Bill Keller on Religion,"In a recent article, The New York Times Magazine implied that Pastor John Hagee has a favorite candidate in the 2012 presidential election. Like most Americans, Hagee has not yet decided whom he will support. Contrary towhat is written, Hagee has never referred to Catholicism as a ‘‘godless theology of hate.’’ When he used those words, Hagee was referring to general Christian anti- Semitism, not to any particular denomination.Further, the coverage asserts that Hagee has a poor relationship with the Catholic community. This is also untrue. Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, very recently put out a press release entitled ‘‘Pastor John Hagee Deserves Better Than False Accusations,’’ in which he directly refutes such assertions.The article also grossly oversimpli!es a sermon Hagee gave concerning the Holocaust and the rise of modern Israel. While some took offense to the sermon, the coverage fails to mention that in Hagee’s subsequent reconciliation with the Anti-Defamation League, its national director, Abe Foxman, thanked Hagee, the founder of the largest pro-Israel group in America, for having ‘‘devoted [his] life to combating anti-Semitism and supporting the State of Israel.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/reply-all-bill-keller-on-religion.html

2011-09-23,Neal Stephenson’s Novel of Computer Viruses and Welsh Terrorists,"Let us say that novelists are like unannounced visitors. While Norman Mailer and Saul Bellow pound manfully on the door, Jonathan Franzen and Zadie Smith knock politely, little preparing you for the emotional ferociousness with which they plan on making themselves at home. Neal Stephenson, on the other hand, shows up smelling vaguely of weed, with a bunch of suitcases. Maybe he can crash for a couple of days? Two weeks later he is still there. And you cannot get rid of him. Not because he is unpleasant but because he is so interesting. Then one morning you wake up and find him gone. You are relieved, a little, but you also miss him. And you wish he’d left behind whatever it was he was smoking, because anything that allows a human being to write six 1,000-page novels in 12 years is worth the health and imprisonment risk.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/reamde-by-neal-stephenson-book-review.html

He explained that he’d rather have this wish than a new vaccine or medicine or even choose the next several American presidents.

2011-09-23,The Less Than Heroic Christopher Columbus,"In 5,000 years of recorded history, scarcely another figure has ignited as much controversy. Each second Monday in October, the familiar arguments flare up. Christopher Columbus, rediscoverer of America, was a visionary explorer. He was a harbinger of genocide. He was a Christianizing messiah. He was a pitiless slave master. He was a lionhearted seaman, a rapacious plunderer, a masterly navigator, a Janus-faced schemer, a liberator of oppressed tribes, a delusional megalomaniac. In “Columbus,” Laurence Bergreen, the author of several biographies, allows scope for all these judgments. But Christopher Columbus was in the first place a terribly interesting man — brilliant, audacious, volatile, paranoid, narcissistic, ruthless and (in the end) deeply unhappy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/columbus-the-four-voyages-by-laurence-bergreen-book-review.html

2011-09-23,A Novel of Stormy Children and Angry Parents in Upstate New York.,"A good three-­quarters of the way through Justin Torres’s first novel, “We the Animals,” readers might find themselves wondering how the narrator — 7 years old at the start and unnamed throughout — keeps his sanity in check. He has seen his mother, delirious and half-deranged from working the overnight shift at the local brewery, scream at him and his two older brothers at 8 on a Sunday evening: “Why aren’t you in school?” He’s seen her make a meatloaf one morning and then call them to dinner as they come down to breakfast, half asleep. He’s seen her carried into the house by his father, her cheeks swollen purple, and been told that “the dentist had been punching on her after she went under.” He’s seen her dragged and forced, by that same father, into a bedroom, behind the door of which the word “stop” has no meaning. And when his father disappears for a time, he’s seen his mother take to the couch for days, miss work, stop eating, stop cooking for them, and drop her head and fall asleep at the kitchen table, surrounded by full ashtrays and empty bottles.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/we-the-animals-by-justin-torres-book-review.html

The cover shows the pie-faced provocateur as a sweetly smiling toddler on a tricycle, but inside, Moore is as pugnacious as ever, inveighing against familiar targets like George W. Bush and corporate stooges, along with the crazed New Yorker who tried to stab him with a No. 2 pencil after a news conference for “Fahrenheit 9/11,” not to mention the more heavily armed crazies who forced him to seek protection from ex-Navy Seal members after he denounced Bush at the 2003 Academy Awards. Moore also briefly wanders into the Mommy Wars, denouncing the pushers of baby formula. “An entire generation of us were introduced in our very first week to the concept that phony was better than real, that something manufactured was better than something that was right there in the room,” Moore writes. “Later in life, this explained the popularity of the fast food burrito, neocons, Kardashians and why we think reading this book on a tiny screen with three minutes of battery life left is enjoyable.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Four immense decorative columns faced us, with ornate bas-relief plasterwork and a mysterious inscription reading “Has tibi, blanda soror Phoebi, sacravimus aedes.

But it delivers another of Mr. Banks’s wrenching, panoramic visions of American moral life, and this one very particular to the early 21st century.

In a telephone interview Mr. Mullin said that Paula Herold — a family friend who is a producer of “Lysistrata Jones” — reached out to him about helping improve the skills of the fictitious Athens University squad members, who show off basketball moves throughout the musical. “I thought it’d be fun to get involved and see what I could do to polish up the playing, make it look more authentic and sharpen the choreography for Broadway,” said Mr. Mullin, who was born in Brooklyn. Only so much basketball polish can be achieved in five days, he said, so he plans to focus on fundamentals like dribbling, passing and body movement, as well as off-court swagger and attitude. The “Lysistrata” actors’ current skills range from good to minimal, people involved with the show said. The men in the cast, below left, will attend the camp for its entire run, while most of the women will attend the first two days. Several of the women play cheerleaders who also handle the ball here and there, a spokesman for the show said. With a book by the Tony Award nominee Douglas Carter Beane (“Sister Act,” “The Little Dog Laughed”) and music and lyrics by Lewis Flinn, “Lysistrata Jones” is scheduled to begin preview performances at the Walter Kerr Theater on Nov. 12 and open on Dec. 14.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/theater/lysistrata-jones-cast-faces-basketball-practice.html

Cain used abandoned buildings to develop her style, and some of her earliest efforts, along the dirt roads of her native upstate New York, went entirely unseen. A 2004 installation in a squat in San Francisco’s North Beach, however, brought her the attention of the art world. She is now represented by Honor Fraser in L.A. and Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco and was recently commissioned by LAND (Los Angeles Nomadic Division) to do an installation in a former Masonic lodge in Marfa, Tex. On view through Dec. 4 as part of a suite of public projects, “Forget Me Not” takes its name from the flower pin once worn by the Masons and later adopted by the Nazis. “Supreme Being” (above), a three-dimensional canvas bordered in gold leaf, is the only component Cain created off-site for the piece; its diagonal stripes were traced from the floorboards in her studio.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/space-invader/

In New York, the Museum of Arts and Design offers a counterpoint with “Crafting Modernism” (Oct. 12 to Jan. 15, 2012), a look at the American Studio Craft Movement, which embraced traditional techniques like woodworking, weaving and silversmithing to produce radical results, like Vladimir Kagan’s trippy mosaic tile table or Jan de Swart’s 1965 blanket chest (top right).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/back-to-the-future-2/

Ms. Williams-Bolar, who works as a teacher’s aide in an Akron public school, is pursuing a degree in family child development. A criminal felony would have hindered her chance of getting a teacher’s license.

He offered me one salient tip before making his exit: “The two most interesting things about Los Angeles,” he said, “are the domestic architecture and the ephemeral population.” He was right: the stream of characters is constant, and the number of exceptional houses is astonishing. And as the critic Reyner Banham had so famously done before me, I got my driver’s license, began reading Esther McCoy and learned to love Los Angeles.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/mother-modern/

2011-09-29,On Ducking Challenges to Naturalism,"In response to the question posed in my previous essay in The Stone — “What is naturalism?”  — Alex Rosenberg defines it as “the philosophical theory that treats science as our most reliable source of knowledge and scientific method as the most effective route to knowledge.” His post, “Why I Am a Naturalist,” nicely exemplifies one of my main complaints, by leaving it unclear what he means by “science” or “scientific method,” even though it is crucial for what he is committing himself to as a “naturalist.” Still, there are clues. He describes “the test of knowledge that scientific findings attain” as “experimental/observational methods,” which suggests that theorems of mathematics would not count as scientific findings. The impression is confirmed by Professor Rosenberg’s phrase “mathematicians and scientists,” as though he doesn’t see mathematicians as scientists. That’s bad news for his naturalism, for mathematical proof is just as effective a route to knowledge as experimental/observational methods. Of course, since the natural sciences depend on mathematics, Rosenberg desires to find a place for it — but admits that he doesn’t know how.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/on-ducking-challenges-to-naturalism/

2011-09-29,Yemen: Succession Plan May Be Near," An agreement between Yemen’s government and its opponents on how to carry out a transfer of power has overcome setbacks caused by the outbreak of violence in the capital last week and is near completion, Yemeni officials said. One of the high-ranking officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing, said some details were pending, but he expected a final version to be agreed upon by the two sides in the coming week. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, thus far, has cooperated with the plan, the official said. The agreement, if finalized, would be an important breakthrough in the standoff between the governing party and the opposition. However, the actual transfer of power document, known as the gulf initiative, would still have to be signed by the Yemeni vice president in order for a full transfer of power from Mr. Saleh. Mr. Saleh made a surprise return to Sana on Friday after nearly four months in Saudi Arabia. He had been receiving treatment there for wounds suffered in a June bomb attack on the presidential palace.

Mr. Shafiei said the officers took his passport and a computer and documents from his office before returning them. Much of his interrogation, he added, concerned the two Americans, Joshua F.

The present government has wanted Agathe Habyarimana to return home to Kigali to face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. Although living in France, she was refused political asylum in 2004 and lost her appeal as well, because French judges had found she was a central figure and exercised real power in the Hutu government that orchestrated the genocide. Yet she was allowed to remain in France and her extradition was not expected this time because French courts have previously refused to hand over suspects to Rwanda for fear that they would not receive a fair trial. The reasoning of the Paris court was not immediately available. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/world/africa/rwanda-france-refuses-to-extradite-presidents-widow.html

2011-09-29,Into Africa,"In centuries past, Africa was known as the “Dark Continent,” which originated less as a slur than as a testament to the deficiency of mapmakers: clueless about the continent’s interior, they would often just blot it out, as if the place didn’t fully exist. Opacity still marks the popular conception of Africa, especially when it comes to its cities, which take a back seat to safari-ready grasslands and oceans of desert. To change this, the celebrated London architect David Adjaye began a decade-long quest to photograph Africa’s urban spaces — practically all of them, save the war-torn Somali capital, Mogadishu. “The project is really fueled by the widespread misconception of Africa as an impoverished or unpeopled expanse,” said Adjaye, who was born to Ghanaian parents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. “I was born in a metropolitan city; I was born in a cosmopolitan condition among different groups of Africans, Indians and Chinese.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/into-africa/

This is something I would like to be a part of.” Neuwirth’s shop (57 Walker Street), which features a starry metal installation by the architect Marc Fornes of “The Very Many” and a living wall of lush green plants, is open until Oct. 12 and stocks Neuwirth’s one-of-a-kind rainbow moonstone pendant necklaces and pieces from her new diamond collection. “I love the contrast between my very modern and feminine gems and Marc’s really modern and conceptual work,” Neuwirth says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/sparkle-spot/

Musicians and singers like Barbara Cook and the National will perform and take part in interviews. Although events may be listed as sold out on the Web site, some tickets are still available to each. Those can be bought on Friday from noon to 4 p.m. at the SVA Theater, 333 West 23rd Street, Chelsea.

Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterback’s nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too.Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. “This is a family game, but it’s also a heated rivalry,” said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries. “You’ve got to go beat up on the ones you love.” In other words, this time it’s personal. Just like all the other times. Pick: Jets.",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/week-4-n-f-l-matchups-2/

Shock was the conventional response to this painting (eventually destroyed by earthquake, along with the church where it hung).

2011-09-30,The Weapons That Were Not There,"Every attentive reader of “Intelligence and U.S. Foreign Policy,” Paul R. Pillar’s long-needed examination of just what the Central Intelligence Agency got right or wrong before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq in 2003, will find one observation or another that seems more disquieting than the rest. I haven’t quite decided which of two deserves pride of place on my own list: The fact that the Bush administration never formally debated whether it was “a good idea” to invade Iraq? Or that Pillar, who ran the National Intelligence Council’s shop for the Middle East during both events, cannot tell us “the true reasons the Bush administration invaded”?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/books/review/intelligence-and-us-foreign-policy-by-paul-r-pillar-book-review.html

Palin filed her own review in the form of a letter to McGinniss’s publisher threatening to sue.

This meant a twist of a bun with a side part and slight wave in the front created by using Pita’s Plump for volume, control hairspray and dry shampoo. The trick was that there was no ponytail beneath to hold the hair; it was deceptively simple. For makeup, McGrath went with a contoured eye and “classic, beautiful red lip.” One of the 28 members of McGrath’s team brought a face by for her approval. “Don’t forget, kids: not a hard lip with pencil, I prefer the finger, it’s softer.” This is what made the lady modern. Three of Dior’s reds were used, chosen based on the clothes: red orange, blue orange and pinky red. Nails were also a mix of five shades: Incognito, a nude; Riviera, an orange; Waterlily, a green; Forget me not, a lavender; and Lucky, a red.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/backstage-beauty-report-christian-dior/

Let’s not be entirely deceived about this. I’m not sure that the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate at large were really ready to deal with gender discrimination no matter who was alleging it. I don’t know that they understood how important the issue was to the integrity of the Supreme Court and to the fitness of the individual who was going on the court. Think about how it might have been different if I had been white and Thomas were, as he is, an African-American male. And just think about one particular senator, Strom Thurmond.

Go find a kid who has been exploited or abandoned, and you will find a soul with grit to spare. Provide that kid with resources for his goals, and you’ll manufacture a success story. But don’t imagine that a caring parent will ever be willing to employ a strategy in advance that allows a child to undergo the searing experiences required for the formation of real grit.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/magazine/reply-all-the-character-test.html

She likes lipstick; she doesn’t like lipstick,” he said. “It’s a fine balance.” This effect was created using foundation mixed with moisturizer and a flush of L’Oréal Glam Bronze in Golden and Universal Sun all over the face and close to the nose “like sun marks.” There was no mascara, but brown kohl was penciled between upper and lower lashes and blended with the finger.

2011-10-03,"Substance, Captured With Style","Much of the time, a documentary is a movie with something to say and a lot of people talking. The current boom in nonfiction filmmaking has been fed, to a large extent, by the impulses of advocacy journalism, according to which the job of the filmmaker is to bring attention to a problem in the world and to assemble experts and eyewitnesses qualified to explain it. While there is nothing wrong with this model — and much to admire about films that seek to instruct and inspire their audiences — it can be wearying and limited. There is so much social concern, so many talking-head interviews wrapped around snippets of archival footage, and, too often, not enough art.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/movies/documentaries-at-the-new-york-film-festival.html
