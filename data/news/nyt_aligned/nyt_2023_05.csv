2023-05-02,This Robot Can Paint. But Is It Art?,"One day recently, on a table in Jean Oh’s lab in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, a robot arm was busy at a canvas.

2023-05-02,How Gwyneth Paltrow Put Concussions On Trial,"In March, on Day 7 of the Gwyneth Paltrow ski trial, after the court spectacle had already been branded everything from a “meme machine” to “the whitest trial of all time,” the retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sat in the witness box, somewhat deflated already. By that point, he probably knew that his pursuit of Paltrow for damages connected to a ski collision he said was her fault was a pretty bad idea. Sanderson claimed that injuries he sustained during the 2016 ski crash (including, notably, a concussion) changed his life, turning him into “a different person,” and “a crippled vet.” Paltrow’s lawyer, the languid, unflappably stone-eyed Stephen Owens, stood before him, presenting Facebook posts — a lot of Facebook posts, some taken months after the collision — as evidence of robust health.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/magazine/gwyneth-paltrow-trial-concussions.html

It’s hard to know how to process it all. But if there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s this: The future — shaped by technologies like artificial intelligence — is going to be profoundly weird.

Fashion girls are “Midwest Christian-types born-again in fuzzy pink cardigans and Dries boots.” A girlfriend’s painstaking domestic labors are described with equal parts unease and grateful relief. The impatient lunch-break Slack ping from a peevish white boss perfectly sets up the doom of the meeting that follows. It is this eye for the rhythms and textures of life — of millennial digital media, of the death by a thousand cuts offered by workplace racism, of Maryland suburbia — that makes this novel vivid and inviting. “Homebodies” is the story of a young Black woman’s quarter-life crisis as she wonders what her place in the world will be.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/books/review/homebodies-tembe-denton-hurst.html

When they are successful, such reports grant us rare access to the psychic antipodes — a chaotic realm of hyper-signification and cosmic paranoia far beyond the boundaries of healthy consciousness.

I’d start with a 39-year-old hayseed — thin as a fence post and prickly as barbed wire — assaulting her typewriter on the ninth floor of the Nebraska State Capitol as a local bank teller plunges 135 feet to his death on the stone transept below. Perhaps I’d cut to the fingernail marks he left on the observation deck five floors above, or the note he left behind. I’d then creep slowly back up to Sandoz, red hair in a French bun, hands on her hips, standing quietly — even knowingly — at the window while her co-workers at the historical society buzz around her.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/travel/lincoln-nebraska-mari-sandoz.html

Scott Fitzgerald’s observation that “France has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older — intelligence and good manners,” we packed up our possessions during the last dark days of one December and decided to move to Paris. It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that — in Paris at least — these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations. Bookstores still held their ground here among the shopfronts, and the deification of French writers living and dead was evinced everywhere in street names and statues and advertising hoardings for new novels. I listened on the radio to an astronaut reading passages aloud from Marguerite Duras from his space station to his earthbound audience below.

2023-05-02,A New Survey Erases Male Artists From the Western Canon,"“Men put me down as the best woman painter,” Georgia O’Keeffe once said. “I think I’m one of the best painters.” That famous quote by the American modernist serves as an epigraph in Part 2 of the Guardian columnist Katy Hessel’s sweeping first book, “The Story of Art Without Men.” “Women artists are not a trend,” Hessel maintains; and yet the contested category persists, not as a meaningful distinction but rather as a repercussion of patriarchy, a category that the male-dominated art world consistently, in O’Keeffe’s terms, diminishes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/books/the-story-of-art-without-men-katy-hessel.html

The hodgepodge style gives children a crash course in how animation has evolved over the years — but they probably won’t realize that. They’ll just be entertained by the visuals. The plot revolves around Chip (John Mulaney) and Dale (Samberg), who, after being estranged, reunite in Los Angeles because their old friend Monterey Jack (Eric Bana) has been kidnapped. They team up with a detective (Kiki Layne) to solve the crime. Chip sells insurance and still looks like old-school 2D animation, while Dale has had “C.G.I. surgery” and pines for their glory days. The movie, directed by Schaffer, doesn’t take itself too seriously, so there’s a silliness mixed with some more elevated (as elevated as a Lonely Island collaboration can be) humor meant to appeal to parents. It’s a fun, fast-paced action comedy, with Will Arnett voicing the villain Sweet Pete, a scruffy, potbellied Peter Pan who looks like he’s seen better days.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/movies/kids-movies-streaming.html
2023-05-05,"For Bispo do Rosario, Art Could Only Be a Divine Calling","Arthur Bispo do Rosario, a former Marine Corps signalman, boxer, tram cleaner and domestic worker in Rio de Janeiro, had no interest in defining his extensive activities as art. His unusual embroidered garments and textiles, ingenious assemblages and use of language had a higher purpose: Bispo was Jesus Christ, according to angels who visited him the night of Dec. 22, 1938, and instructed him to record, or possibly replicate reality. Thus, the title of his first retrospective in the United States, at the Americas Society in Manhattan: “Bispo do Rosario: All Existing Materials on Earth.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/arts/design/bispo-do-rosario-brazilian-artist.html

2023-05-05,A São Paulo Apartment Designed With Calculated Flaws,"GROWING UP BETWEEN Rio de Janeiro and the rural interior of Minas Gerais, a rugged, sprawling state in southeastern Brazil, the architect Mariana Schmidt moved often with her father, an engineer working on the state highway system. Brazil’s second most populous state, Minas Gerais grew during an early 18th-century gold rush that brought in speculators and enslaved people, a forced migration that continued into the next century as agriculture supplanted mining. Though raised in the shadows of Modernism — her grandfather, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, worked in the 1950s on the construction of the exactingly planned Brasília, which would become the national capital in 1960 — Schmidt, 40, was more interested in Minas Gerais’s farmsteads and quilombos, settlements founded by those who escaped slavery before it was abolished in 1888. She loved the warmth of the lime-slaked village houses and the efficiency of the rough-hewn wooden furniture. Life in rural Minas Gerais moved slower than it did in São Paulo, the metropolis where she’s resided since 2005. “The days feel longer. People wake up early, they sleep early, they live according to the light,” she says. “All my references are about that simplicity.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/t-magazine/mariana-schmidt-sao-paulo.html

What makes it coveted as a dish in some cultures is the texture, which is nothing like jelly at all.

2023-05-08,El Bulli’s Explores Gastronomy in an Expansive Series of Books,"In 2011 the chef Ferran Adrià stepped back and closed his avant-garde restaurant, El Bulli, to pursue a foundation dedicated to food ideas. The El Bulli Foundation, which replaced his restaurant, is now publishing more than 20 books about many aspects of gastronomy. It’s part of the Bullipedia project, encyclopedic surveys and analyses written by teams of experts. There are eight volumes of intensely‌ detailed books on wine, Bullipedia Wine Sapiens; the first two, “Contextualizaton and Viticulture” and “Vinification and Classifications,” have been translated from Spanish into English — subsidized by Juvé & Camps, a venerable cava producer — and are now available in the United States. “We examined many books on wine, even wine atlases, but found none that took our encyclopedic approach,” Mr. Adrià said. The books are designed for professionals and gastronomes, especially for those who are engaged in and appreciate fine-dining, which Mr. Adrià contends is thriving. With Hubbell precision, the books examine the history, evolution, production, categorization, serving and appreciation of good wine, illustrating the material with close-ups of ripening berries, pruning methods, climate maps, bottling and more in the first two books’ nearly 1,200 pages. Mr. Adrià and Ferran Centelles, the sommelier who covers the beverage side of the project, say they have made discoveries, like the first printed wine list from 1804. It is all, however, seen through a Western lens; the foundation’s definition of fine dining ‌is limited — it does not invite Asian cuisines to the table, for example. “We can only be experts in Western culture,” Mr. Adrià said.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/08/dining/el-bulli-books-bullipedia.html

Some of the first books to examine that year have set a high bar. “His Name Is George Floyd,” by the journalists Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa, captured the crushing force of American racism through a meticulous biography of the man whose killing at the hands of a police officer led to nationwide racial protests.

Kim) — who must return to their family home to help care for their father (Dana Lee), disconsolate and bedridden after being laid off from his lifelong job. Though concerned for him, the kids are conflicted, having suffered at their father’s somewhat tyrannical hands growing up. The film is at its most compelling when tackling this tension between care and resentment head-on — it has a ring of truth that’s sadly squandered whenever Huang reaches for easy laughs.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/movies/dealing-with-dad-review.html

But at a town hall hosted by the network on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential campaign, resumed the lies and name-calling that marked his presidency. Answering questions from the anchor Kaitlan Collins, he repeated misinformation about the 2020 election, called the writer E. Jean Carroll, who won a suit accusing him of sexual abuse and defamation, a “wack job” and derided Ms. Collins as a “nasty person.” When Ms. Collins tried to correct Mr. Trump’s lies, he often talked over her. The largely sympathetic audience cheered him on throughout the evening. Critics of CNN’s forum said it was reckless to give Mr. Trump such a large platform for his message, especially because it proved difficult to fact check his statements in real time. The chairman of CNN, Chris Licht, defended the broadcast on Thursday, saying it underscored that covering Mr. Trump would “continue to be messy and tricky.”",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/14/business/the-week-in-business-trump-cnn.html

There is real, deliberate damage being done to words: A war becomes a “special military operation,” for example. The emergence of chat-based A.I. models such as ChatGPT, meanwhile, divorces us from the process of communication as a thoughtful series of decisions about how to best make ourselves understood by others. There are always, of course, scales more modest than these. Sometimes the simplest sentiments get twisted and freighted in ways we never intended: That I could not make time for someone does not mean I do not love them; but I can’t add a footnote to clarify my intentions. The possibility of truly conveying meaning to someone else — which is, after all, the whole point — begins to seem remote.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/magazine/bilingual-editions.html

2023-05-16,The Artists Depicting the Power and Strangeness of Breasts,"Women’s breasts have been a fixation of Western artists since Western art began. The prehistoric sculptor who carved a hunk of mammoth ivory into the “Venus of Hohle Fels” — the earliest known depiction of a human being, unearthed in Germany in 2008 — gave her proportions fit for the pages of Juggs magazine. Since then, male artists have portrayed breasts as erotic objects, fonts of nourishment and sometimes both at once, as in the case of racy Baroque depictions of the Roman virtue Caritas as a young woman nursing her father. Bare-chested women have represented our brightest political ideals (as in the French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 allegorical work “Liberty Leading the People”) but also our worst transgressions: In medieval European art, lust often appeared as a woman with snakes biting her breasts, an allusion to their supposedly ruinous seductive power. Indeed, these humble mounds of tissue, as the feminist scholar Marilyn Yalom writes in her 1998 book, “A History of the Breast,” have long been the focal points for various desires: “Babies see food. Men see sex. Doctors see disease. Businessmen see dollar signs.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/t-magazine/art-nudity-women-breasts.html

2023-05-18,I Had to Quit Therapy to Finally Be Ready for It,"I came to therapy as most people do: in desperation. After a sexual assault triggered my latent depression, I dropped out of college a semester before graduating. Over the next year, I grappled my way to the diploma. I knew I wasn’t well, but I still wanted to exercise some agency in my choice of treatment: Psychoanalysis sounded smart, flattering my vanity, and the institutes had lower fees for patients willing to undergo what they called a “full analysis.” The phrase shares a certain boastful intensity with “full throttle” and “full frontal,” and the program — four sessions per week laid up on the couch — was indeed demanding. If I was going to admit I needed therapy, the most rigorous version was probably the best. So I signed up. Dr. S was beautiful, warm and almost confrontational in her candor.

2023-05-18,Poem: wild and blue,"In “wild and blue,” the country musician and poet Julian Talamantez Brolaski has written a 21st-century troubadour’s lament. The poem begins with light and wind — fixtures of poetry. There’s the lyric sweetness of herons and mountains. Even Chaucer’s zephyr shows up. At its midpoint, however, the poem turns. The sorry state of the poet is revealed. The wind won’t blow, or at least not yet. The poem ceases to fly: Instead it’s grounded in the dusty corner. The diction turns, too, from the poetical to the everyday, nearly antipoetical idioms of “crying my eyes out” and “it’s no picnic.” Sadness has done this, extracted the wildness from both the poet and the poet’s vocabulary. Then the kink in the light returns. (This poem was originally commissioned by United States Artists and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and appeared recently in a slightly different form in Shift Space.) Selected by Anne Boyer",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/magazine/poem-wild-and-blue.html

2023-05-18,‘Come Out Fighting’ Review: The Battle of the Budget,"The microbudget war movie “Come Out Fighting” is so conspicuously cheap-looking that it could be initially mistaken for one of the direct-to-video mockbusters made by the somewhat infamous indie studio The Asylum — those thrifty, semi-plagiaristic exploitation flicks like “Ardennes Fury” or “Operation Dunkirk,” which have little to recommend them besides their zany, so-bad-it’s-almost-good zeal. But while it has a blatant shoestring sheen, “Come Out Fighting” isn’t arch or irony-laden; in fact, the tone is quite serious, albeit also seriously clichéd. Between the dogfights, ambushes, minefield maneuvers and flamethrower attacks — all of them realized with cut-rate visual effects — the film is contemplative and somber, pensively reflecting on such steadfast wartime themes as determination, valor and courage among men.

2023-05-23,"Restaurant Yuu, an Omakase With a French Approach, Opens in Brooklyn","Multicourse, high-priced omakase counters with limited seating continue to proliferate. Is it because New York’s intimate sushi counters can’t meet the demand? Whatever the reason, the latest example in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with 18 seats at a black marble counter facing an impressive open kitchen, follows a playbook that’s as French as it is Japanese. The chef and owner, Yuu Shimano, graduated from the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, Japan, and Lyon, France. He then worked at Guy Savoy in Paris and moved to New York to become the executive chef at Mifune. Mr. Shimano; his chef de cuisine, Shuji Furukawa; and the pastry chef Masaki Takahashi serve an 18-course tasting menu ($250) starting with a smoked trout tartlet with fennel cream, an octopus fritter, and caviar with sour cream on brioche garnished with a shiso flower. After dishes like smoked mackerel confit, a mushroom flan with surf clam and English peas, and fluke and scallop mousse in cabbage with a vin blanc sauce, the finale is his signature duck pie, like a well-burnished duck Wellington with foie gras. Wine and sake or nonalcoholic pairings are options. The restaurant has a couple of plush lounge areas for after-dinner mignardises and digestifs suggested by Akio Matsumoto, the sommelier. There are seatings at 6 and 8:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/dining/restaurant-yuu-omakase-brooklyn-restaurant-opening.html

Some readers will already know this life. For them — for us — the poem is a recognition, one I don’t often see in contemporary poetry. Poets, however, were once experts on the ecstasy of the gutter. As Francois Villon or Charles Baudelaire did before her, Wang writes poetry that reminds us that life is more than the grim fatalism of to-do lists and bank accounts. The poem rushes forward, headed toward the edge. Then the lover-thieves get caught. The bill comes due. The poem slows. The heart breaks. This was, after all, an elegy. Despite the living thrill of its cadence, “those days,” those lovers, are gone now. What’s left is poetry.

The idea crystallized when they returned in 2016 and discovered a pair of 16th-century buildings in the city’s Largo de São Domingos neighborhood — they’d soon be available but needed work. Now, they’re an integral part of the Largo, the pair’s inaugural hospitality project (opening this week) that combines an 18-room hotel spread across five heritage buildings with the first Porto-based restaurant, Cozinha das Flores, and bar, Flôr, from the Lisbon-born, London-based chef Nuno Mendes. Designed by Space Copenhagen with a focus on local materials and the work of regional artisans — including the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Álvaro Siza, who created a tiled mural for the restaurant — each space reinterprets the look and feel of a Portuguese home. Mendes, who will be cooking dishes such as a sweet prawn and steamed egg cake with presunto balchão (ham in a spicy, vinegary sauce), had long fantasized about pursuing a project in his mother’s homeland. “That, combined with the opportunity to create a street-facing restaurant with rooms above, was particularly exciting,” he says. “Hosting people for a night is great, but if you have 24 hours with them, things get a lot more fun.” The Largo opens May 25, thelargo.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/t-magazine/fabric-east-london-cloth.html

The connection between them is the recently widowed Hollis Shaw, who invited four women from different eras of her life (high school, college, minivan life and midlife) to her fabulous Nantucket summer home to celebrate friendship and, ultimately, to help Hollis, the food influencer, move into the next phase of life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/books/review/beach-reads.html
2023-05-26,"From Subatomic Particles to the Cosmos, and Every Bird in Between","If you’d asked me a month ago what quantum theory was, I would have tried to answer only to stop myself once I realized that I didn’t actually know. It’s one of those concepts, like space-time or artificial intelligence, that many of us recognize (from science fiction, from the news) without ever really understanding them. That’s where QUANTUM SUPREMACY: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything (Random House Audio, 10 hours, 41 minutes), by the renowned translator of theoretical physics Michio Kaku, comes in. Named for the theoretical stage at which “a radically new type of computer, called a quantum computer, could decisively outperform an ordinary digital supercomputer on specific tasks,” the audiobook, read with deliberate — if at times robotic — clarity by Feodor Chin, begins with claims, by a handful of companies, that we are already there.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/books/new-audiobooks.html

Unconventional arrangements are the order of the day in a dynamic revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Aspects of Love,” which opened on Thursday at the Lyric Theater in London. This two-act musical, inspired by a 1955 novel by David Garnett, pits a young man against his uncle in a tussle for the affections of a mercurial actress; it is a camp, unapologetically amoral romp featuring blithe betrayals, intrafamilial partner-swapping and questionable intergenerational flirtations. (It is a lot raunchier than Lloyd Webber’s most recent work, which invited the audience to “sing unto the Lord with the harp” during the coronation of King Charles III.)",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/theater/aspects-of-love-lyric-theater-london.html

She’s heard the jokes about the closed-minded Indian parents forcing their children to go to medical school. Now she fires back forcefully, with enough panache to subvert stereotypes even as she’s fully embracing them. Her ethnic and religious humor (she makes a convincing case for Hindu being the most chill religion) is unapologetically old-fashioned: quick setups, rapid-fire punchlines, her name in giant letters on the set behind her. There’s a genuine warmth behind the slickness. You believe her extreme pride in her daughter going to Stanford just as much as her operatic horror at the fact that she’s studying ceramics. Garg has the kind of presence that powers network sitcoms. Of the recent spate of specials produced by Amazon Prime, tentatively tiptoeing into competition with Netflix, hers is the best.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/arts/television/stand-up-specials-memorial-day-weekend.html
