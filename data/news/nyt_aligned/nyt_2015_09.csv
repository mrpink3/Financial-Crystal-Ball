By improving the utility’s creditworthiness, Prepa’s borrowing costs would also go down. The total face value of Prepa’s outstanding debt is about $8.1 billion; of that, about $2.4 billion has been insured. The negotiations cover only the remaining $5.7 billion. Prepa and its bondholders have been in restructuring talks for more than a year, and during that time its creditors agreed not to take any legal action to enforce their claims. The agreement was scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, but people with knowledge of the talks said they expected that a deal would be announced early Wednesday.

2015-09-02,What’s On TV Wednesday,"10 P.M. (TCM) BARRY LYNDON (1975) An Irish rogue (Ryan O’Neal, above right, with James Magee) gambles, fights and seduces his way to the apex of 18th-century British society in Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s first novel. His undoing comes at the hand of a widowed beauty (Marisa Berenson), whose high station gives her license to be boring. This comedy of manners “is so long and leisurely, so panoramic in its narrative scope, that it’s as much an environment as it is a conventional film,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “Its austerity of purpose defines it as a costume movie unlike any other you’ve seen.” The film is part of a tribute to the Oscar-winning composer Leonard Rosenman, starting at 8 with “A Man Called Horse.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Critics of welfare repeatedly argued that the increase of unwed mothers was mainly due to rising rates of welfare payments through Aid to Families With Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.). Even though the ­scientific ­evidence offered little support for this claim, the public’s outrage against the program, fueled by the “welfare queen” stereotype that Ronald Reagan peddled in stump speeches during his 1976 run for the presidency, led to calls for a major revamping of the welfare system.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/books/review/2-00-a-day-by-kathryn-j-edin-and-h-luke-shaefer.html

In her latest work, “To Being,” she shifts her focus from the voice to the body to explore the precariousness of a dancer moving ceaselessly in performance. Her underlying question: “How can we give more when all we feel is that we’ve met our limit?” The work, which also includes the dancers Julian Barnett and Molly Poerstel and sound by Tian Rotteveel, delves even more deeply into her research practice known as “nonstopping,” which means moving but never arriving.

The new Rio is taking shape in fits and starts: The downtown port area is in the midst of an impressive overhaul of public works, exhumed historic sites and new museums. And with it, energy has been flowing toward more central, bustling neighborhoods, away from the traditional South Zone destinations of Copacabana and Ipanema — though their beaches still give a party on the sand like no other.

By turns heartwarming, scary, playful and groovy, this recording reveals worlds inside a single instrument.

2015-09-03,Gaza: U.N. Issues Warning About Living Conditions," A United Nations agency has warned that Gaza may become uninhabitable by 2020 if current political and economic trends continue. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said in a statement released late Tuesday that eight years of effective bans on most exports, three major conflicts and tight restrictions on materials entering Gaza had “shattered its ability to export and produce for the domestic market, ravaged its already debilitated infrastructure, left no time for reconstruction and economic recovery, and accelerated the de-development” of the Gaza Strip. According to the agency, “Gaza’s 1.8 million inhabitants rely on coastal aquifers as their main source of freshwater, yet 95 percent of this water is not safe to drink.” Moreover, the unemployment rate exceeds 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Gazans do not have reliable access to adequate supplies of food. A United Nations report in 2012 contained similar warnings, but it appears that widespread destruction caused by last summer’s conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants may have accelerated those trends. Israel and Egypt heavily restricted the movement of people and goods into Gaza after the militant Hamas group seized power of the territory in 2007.

More than 10,000 of the kits have undergone testing for DNA and other evidence, an effort that has cost the state millions of dollars. So far, 21 convictions have resulted from the evidence. But officials warned that the work of investigating and prosecuting cases still had years to go and would cost millions more. At a news conference with Gov. Rick Snyder, state and local officials said the tests had produced 2,616 matches with DNA samples in the F.B.I.’s national database, with evidence of 477 serial rapists and links to crimes in 39 states and the District of Columbia. An investigation by Michigan State University researchers, funded by the Justice Department, pointed to a chronic lack of resources, rapid turnover in the department and a sense of triage in a high-crime city as contributing to sexual assault cases’ not being treated seriously enough.

Frances McDormand plays William’s protective mother, a college professor; Zooey Deschanel, his rebellious older sister; Philip Seymour Hoffman, the critic Lester Bangs; and Billy Crudup, Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater, to whom William is drawn. And Kate Hudson (above right with Mr. Fugit) is Penny Lane, the ringleader of a troupe of groupies who call themselves the Band-Aids. “We don’t have intercourse,” she says. “We inspire the music.” Mr. Crowe “may be the least cynical director working in Hollywood today,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Of course, rock ’n’ roll is not always about being nice.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Instead, over the past few decades, historians have been extending their inquiries. Investigators who once understood the wartime massacres as a unique historical episode that mainly concerned Germans and Jews and was driven principally by ideology have increasingly produced comparative studies of regions and states, turning their attention to other victims and to what Eastern European archives are able to tell us about the dynamics of persecution and mass murder; economic issues; and the motivations of perpetrators, bystanders, women, religious and political leaders, neutrals, rescuers and others. So voluminous is this scholarly outpouring that few are able to keep up with it, although some historians continue to grapple with the subject as a whole. Notwithstanding all this effort, Timothy Snyder, a Yale University specialist in Eastern Europe, contends in “Black Earth” that our understanding of the Holocaust has failed us.

Accordingly, it is designed with buttonholes on its double pockets, stitched with an emphasis on strength and constructed from a sturdy material like khaki or covert or, most classically, a cotton called chambray. You can have a chambray shirt in any color you want, and if that color is blue, you also have a social construct and a rhetorical device: The shirt’s blue collar is a mass-­produced idea as durable and versatile as the garment itself. With blue-­collar identity now more a matter of cultural style than of occupational history, the term is perfectly slippery, such that the assertions that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has ‘‘blue-­collar appeal’’ and an ‘‘anti-­union agenda’’ are not fundamentally incompatible. The phrase ‘‘blue collar’’ has flourished precisely because it is concrete in its imagery and vague in its connotations, vividly conjuring a labor-­class scene while sidestepping such a nasty word as ‘‘class.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/magazine/is-the-blue-collar-shirt-still-blue-collar.html

It also reverses our customary perspective on the world, with an immense expanse of midnight-blue ocean occupying almost the entirety of the frame while familiar land masses — Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, the coast of West Africa, the Caribbean islands — are relegated to a fringe around the edges. A similar desire to change our outlook animates the photography show this image introduces, as well as the space that’s hosting it.

2015-09-03,Inside the Mind of a Japanese Master Plant Stylist,"You could say it’s growing season for Satoshi Kawamoto, the Japanese plant artist and creative director behind lush installations for brands like Filson, Gant Rugger and Mr Porter. In March, he relocated the New York outpost of his Green Fingers empire (five locations in Tokyo, two in Yokohama) from the East Village to a larger — but still modest — location on the Lower East Side. At a glance, the storefront reads like a plant nursery; but it’s also a boutique, and not just of botanicals. Unruly houseplants and tiny, prim succulents grow among clothes, accessories, lighting (some flea-market-sourced and some designed by Kawamoto himself) and Japanese-made housewares – all for sale. “People who are not interested in plants but who are interested in looking for plates, handbags or clothes — may end up buying plants,” he explains of the renewed interest in foliage as a home accent, among people who subscribe to a certain (Brooklynized) aesthetic. And on the flip side, “people who are looking for plants may end up buying some beautiful vintage clothes.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/t-magazine/satoshi-kawamoto-plant-stylist.html

As the nearly 200 images here attest, the gap between one and the other is smaller than you’d think.

Mr. Ntaganda was allowed to address the court briefly after teams of prosecution and defense lawyers had each delivered their opening presentations on the charges he faces related to attacks in 2002 and 2003 in which villagers in Ituri, a Congolese mining area, were killed or raped. Mr. Ntaganda, 41, who was born in Rwanda, said he had joined the Tutsi forces in Rwanda that put an end to that country’s genocide in 1994, then later moved across the border to Ituri. “The word had gone out to kill all the Tutsis in Ituri, or those who looked like them,” he said. His role was to protect civilians, he said in court. “I ask you to make a distinction between a revolutionary rebel and a criminal.” Earlier, the prosecutor had called him a “notorious and powerful” fighter who enriched himself and used children as his foot soldiers and henchmen and as sexual slaves for his troops.

But the Ministry of Health called for 90 days of “heightened surveillance” around the country to watch for any new cases. Dr. Gasasira applauded the government and Liberian communities for their quick response to the May outbreak, which left two people dead. The government has urged all Liberians to continue observing preventive measures like washing hands and is strengthening its monitoring efforts across the country, said Dr. Francis Ketteh, Liberia’s chief medical officer. More than 4,800 people have died in Liberia because of the Ebola crisis, according to the World Health Organization.

The initial review, conducted by the Office of Congressional Ethics, found that his staff appeared to have “researched a potential campaign opponent, prepared materials for the campaign, used information from the congressional office for campaign purposes and discussed campaign matters during official meetings,” in the lawmaker’s district office and at a staff retreat.

2015-09-04,Colorado: Pro-Marijuana Activists Pull Back on Ballot Measure,"Pro-marijuana activists campaigning to allow the drug to be used legally in adults-only businesses like nightclubs or bars said on Thursday they were withdrawing a ballot measure that would have put the issue before voters in Denver in November. Activists said they were pulling the initiative because they believed they could reach a compromise with city  officials and business groups that would result in local legislation to allow some limited social use of marijuana in Denver. When Colorado voters in 2012 became the first in the nation, along with Washington State, to legalize marijuana for recreational use, they did so with a caveat: No public use. But advocates said the restrictions on public use were too strict and had prohibited marijuana everywhere except private homes and a handful of marijuana-friendly bed-and-breakfasts scattered around the state. The ballot proposal would have allowed people to eat edible marijuana or inhale vaporized forms of marijuana indoors, but would have relegated smoking to outdoor areas blocked from public view. Organizers said that it was still too early to know what might be included in a compromise ordinance, and that if the effort stalled, they might reintroduce the ballot measure next year.

Since the portrayals of world-destroying deluges in early writings (“Gilgamesh,” the Matsya Purana, Genesis, the “Timaeus”), narratives of apocalypse have structured our understanding of time and history. Religious eschatology looks to the end of days as a prelude to the absolute finality of the kingdom of God. Secularized as “the Singularity,” a similar idea drives the imagination of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and cybernetic doomsayers, who believe we are approaching a technological punctum beyond which humanity as we know it will no longer exist. In the face of economic crisis and anxiety about climate change, postapocalyptic science fiction, long a genre staple, is undergoing one of its cyclical peaks of popularity. Our screens and pages are crowded with survivors, grimly coping with the aftermath of plagues, wars, natural disasters, zombie attacks and alien invasions.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/books/review/the-wake-by-paul-kingsnorth.html

We were a “despised ­minority” when Asian immigrants threatened 19th- and early-20th-century white labor, yet since the Cold War we’ve been described as a “model minority,” valorizing the promise of American meritocracy. The capricious ease with which those labels get swapped highlights how our precarious social position rests on our perceived utility: as cheap labor, as anti-­Communist soldiers, as overachievers meant to ­success-shame other communities of ­color. In doing all of this “work,” Lee argues, Asian-­Americans have redefined not only immigration politics and racial categories but also “the very essence of what it means to be ­American.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/books/review/the-making-of-asian-america-by-erika-lee.html

At nightfall, amid the multitude, he spots a man who absorbs his attention. He decides to pursue him, until at last the sun begins to rise again and the narrator realizes that he has been following nothing but a man of the crowd — a man, the reader suspects, who mirrors the narrator in his banal pursuit of others and in his incapacity for being alone.

2015-09-04,Inside the List,"The 11th Coming: “The Nature of the Beast,” Louise Penny’s 11th novel about the Québécois detective Armand Gamache, hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 3. Penny started the series in 2005 after two decades as a CBC radio host, and its popularity caught her by surprise. “It’s difficult to learn from success. I’ve learned more from my mistakes,” she told the author and critic Joel Yanofsky in 2013. “Fortunately, I’m capable of manufacturing my own problems.” In her 20s and early 30s those included a battle with alcoholism, and later a five-year bout of writer’s block that was, according to Yanofsky, “mainly spent watching Oprah, eating gummy bears and lying to everyone, including her husband, about how well her writing was going.” Things have improved since then. “Now I know that if I’m not in the top five on the Times best-seller list, I’m going to feel like a failure,” she said in the same interview. No worries here! But that doesn’t mean Penny’s life is challenge-free: In the past few years she’s had to care for her husband as he slides into dementia. “I find now that the writing is a safe harbor,” she told The Vancouver Sun last month. “It’s a place I go to that is mine.” You have to wonder if Penny had her husband’s condition in mind when she quoted Yeats’s “The Second Coming” in the new book — that’s the poem about things falling apart and the center not holding, which concludes, “And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” Maybe. But mostly, Penny told The Sun, “the beast is ourselves.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-09-07,What’s on TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) WILD (2014) Reese Witherspoon, in an Oscar-nominated performance, portrays Cheryl Strayed, who copes with the aftermath of her heroin use, her marital infidelity and the death of her mother by hiking the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, spanning more than 1,000 miles, from the Southern California desert to the forests of Oregon. Her routine — walking, thinking, pitching her tent at night and packing it up in the morning — is punctuated by montages of memories and encounters in the wilderness, mostly with men. Some are scary; others are kind; but almost all are intrigued by the presence of a solitary woman so far from civilization. “ ‘Wild’ may be full of natural beauty — Yves Bélanger’s cinematography unostentatiously captures the infinite colors and vistas of the West — but it is also a celebration of the power of art,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Jean-Marc Vallée’s adaptation of Ms. Strayed’s memoir, from a script by Nick Hornby. And the film has its shortcomings, he added, with too much montage in the middle and too much voice-over at the end, and maybe not quite enough detail about some of Cheryl’s relationships. “But you wouldn’t want a movie that celebrates imperfection, improvisation and the importance of mistakes to be slick or seamless. What makes its heroine worth caring about — what makes her a rare and exciting presence in contemporary American film — is not that she’s tidy or sensible or even especially nice. It’s that she’s free.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-09-07,What’s On TV Sunday,"8 P.M. (13) ARTHUR & GEORGE In the time it took to puff on his pipe, Sherlock Holmes would have discerned everything: the eavesdropper at the private club, as well as his name, political persuasion and birthplace — all from the dust on his shoes. But Arthur Conan Doyle? Shockingly oblivious, a detractor declares in this three-part “Masterpiece Mystery!” presentation. “If you pursue your interest in the Edalji case, you’ll be judged by his high standards, and judged harshly,” the man chides Holmes’s creator. “But if you fall short, as you are bound to do, you’ll taint not only yourself but the world’s favorite consulting detective.” Edalji is the titular George, an Anglo-Indian solicitor imprisoned for mutilating livestock — and threatening schoolgirls with worse — in 1903 Staffordshire. He longs to be exonerated for crimes he maintains he did not commit, and Conan Doyle wagers his reputation that Edalji’s conviction was racially motivated. Martin Clunes, above, and Arsher Ali star in this adaptation of Julian Barnes’s fact-based novel, which unveils Conan Doyle’s personal life as he contemplates a future with his true love after his wife’s death. Charles Edwards plays Conan Doyle’s secretary, Alfred Wood — in other words, his Dr. Watson. “There’s just enough Sherlockian fun — Conan Doyle’s deductive abilities’ being compared unfavorably with those of his creation, Wood’s alarm when Conan Doyle considers a false beard as a disguise — to make the case for ‘Arthur & George,’ ” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times.

The so-called separated family members have never been allowed to exchange letters or meet each other, unless both governments arranged occasional reunions limited to a few hundred people. The last such reunions took place in February last year. After an overnight negotiation at the border village of Panmunjom, the two Koreas signed an agreement on Tuesday to hold a new round of family reunions at the Diamond Mountain resort in the southeast of North Korea on Oct. 20-26.

He wants Bertram to befriend his widow, Gwen (Téa Leoni), and prevent her from remarrying. She hates Bertram, and then she doesn’t. “A latter-day hybrid of ‘Topper’ and ‘Blithe Spirit’ and a visual ode to autumn in New York, ‘Ghost Town’ is a screwball comedy with no big surprises or hidden metaphors,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this romantic froth, directed by David Koepp. But instead of becoming “mired in sentimentality like flies in molasses,” the film “tiptoes to the edge of that sticky mess, but it doesn’t get caught there.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/arts/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

At the time he died in September 2011, Awlaki was probably the most prominent jihadi terrorist in the world apart from Osama bin Laden. The president who announced that death, Barack Obama, has become identified with drone strikes since they are the principal tool his administration has used to fight international terrorists.

Attending a four-year private college cost around $2,000 a year: affordable, with some scrimping, to even median earners. As for public university, it was a bargain at $510 a year. To put these figures in current dollars, we’re talking about median family income of $62,000, a house for $174,000 and a sticker price of $21,300 for the car, $10,300 for the private university and $2,500 for the public one.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/is-college-tuition-too-high.html

Judge Dennis M. Wiley of Berrien County District Court said in a ruling dated Thursday that a different judge would resentence Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson said he believed the girl was 17 and above the age of consent in Michigan when they met online and subsequently had a single sexual encounter in December. Mr. Anderson, a resident of Indiana, pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and probation, but he was told that he would spend the rest of his life on the state’s sex offender registry. He was also ordered not to use the Internet or smartphones for five years, forcing him to abandon computer science studies at a community college. Mr. Anderson’s lawyer said he hoped that a new judge would grant his client a special status under Michigan law for youthful offenders, which would mean he would not be required to be on the state’s sex offender registry.

The duchess’s first child and the king’s first granddaughter was born at 2:40 a.m. at 17 Bruton Street, London, house of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore, the Duchess of York’s parents. She became the third heir in the line of succession to the throne, ranking after the Prince of Wales and her father. She is expected to be christened Mary Victoria Elizabeth, respectively after Queen Mary, who will be the child’s principal godmother; after Queen Victoria, whose name it has become the custom to keep in each royal generation, and after her mother, the Duchess of York. The last name will probably be that by which the child will be known, and thus a famous name in British history will be revived in the Royal family. — The New York Herald, European Edition, April 22, 1926",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/1926-second-queen-elizabeth-in-prospect-with-birth-of-british-royal-child/

And the group’s second record, “Gomory: The Book of Angels, Vol. 25” (Tzadik), released in May, is astonishingly beautiful, a high point in the series: The singers’ individually rigorous tones and dispositions and arranging impulses surround the music and give it another dimension of originality; it sounds medieval and new at the same time.

As reported in The New York Times, Anthony Hopkins, who starred, asked him to explain the play’s ending. Pinter’s response: “I don’t know. Just do it.” Pinter has since died, but his masterly and enigmatic dramas, as spare as his advice to actors, endure, although New York is perhaps due for a revival of “Old Times” (an acclaimed English production in 2013 starred Rufus Sewell). The 1971 play is about a couple who are visited by an old friend of the wife’s whose stories from the past startle and confuse, setting up a classic Pinter power struggle that manages to be both brutal and elusive at once. In this new production, the Oscar nominee Clive Owen makes his Broadway debut opposite Eve Best (who starred in the Broadway revival of Pinter’s “The Homecoming”) and Kelly Reilly (“True Detective,” the Donmar Warehouse’s “After Miss Julie”).

2015-09-09,A New Kind of Uniform,"DESIGNERS HAVE always had a soft spot for the hard men who protect us during wartime. The word ‘‘panache,’’ after all, is borrowed from the French term for a plume on a helmet. This season, they seem taken with the romantic side of the historical soldier, with clothing that evokes sepia-toned photographs and the verse of Rupert Brooke. Inspired by military ‘‘drabs’’ with a dose of sober black, designers have created an aura more poetic than macho. Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen celebrated a hero returned, his coat emblazoned with eight-point stars resembling the Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. Gucci accessorized a military-style jacket with a bag whose strap was reminiscent of the Sam Browne belt, named after the British officer who created it at the dawn of the Raj era. Craig Green reinterpreted the billowing straps of the daring parachutist. ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/t-magazine/military-style-design-fashion.html

That matter, which was not part of the case against Mr. Jurek, remains a question. Walter McKee, Mr. Jurek’s lawyer, said that while Baxter was hoping the charges might limit the number of hikers, “as a result of the attention, there will probably be more people on the trail and in the park.” R. Christopher Almy, who prosecuted the case, said the $500 fine — up from the normal $200 — reflected the seriousness of the charge.

Hall). “As it detects increasingly vital signs of life behind the absurd surfaces that Mr. Mendes presents so beautifully, the film takes on a gravity to match its evil zest.

He never posed for a photograph in a wrestling singlet, in Zen robes or atop a granite outcrop whose austere majesty was echoed by his windswept quiff. By September 1985, when I became his student and his friend, there was no hair at all to invite the wind’s attention. The luster of his pate gave his head the appearance of the polished ball end of some precision-­engineered chrome socket, or an observatory dome. You might have supposed that the mind inside that dome was busy working up new techniques of heat dissipation in airplane engines, but not new plots, new characters. He wore button-down shirts, tucked into jeans that were belted and pressed. His preferred footwear was the kind of tan hybrid of sneaker and Oxford shoe favored by Elderhostelers. Sometimes, it is true, he would wear a floppy-brimmed bucket hat and a funny kind of jacket, vaguely suggestive of an interest in trout fishing or photo safaris.

2015-09-10,The Pink and the Black,"In these boom times for biographies written for children, the 20th-century fashion designers Elsa Schiaparelli and Coco Chanel make good subjects: Their lives were filled with drama and intrigue, not to mention stunning visuals. Both worked hard and succeeded against long odds, defying convention on the way to making a real impact on the world. Each honed her craft and rose to prominence in 1920s Paris, but they had little in common, background-wise or personality-wise: The down-to-earth yet flamboyant Schiaparelli came from a cultured, well-off Italian family, the theatrical but restrained Chanel from a dirt-poor French one. The two women developed a tense rivalry, capped off by their choices during World War II, when Schiaparelli did relief work for the French and trained as a Red Cross nurse’s aide, while Chanel became a Nazi agent. So it’s fitting that two new books intended to plant their life stories in the imaginations of a new generation, “Hot Pink: The Life and Fashions of Elsa Schiaparelli” and “Coco and the Little Black Dress,” take completely different approaches.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/books/review/books-about-coco-chanel-and-elsa-schiaparelli-review.html

There were longtime friends (and some rivals) in the group, but overall, the mood was one of celebration. And why not?

Ushering in the fall season at New York Live Arts on Wednesday, this Canadian dancer — best known as a leading member of Édouard Lock’s La La La Human Steps (from 1981 to 1999) — comes out, arms and legs swinging, in loose track pants and a skin-hugging top. Often during this moody, 60-minute work, it seems that Ms. Lecavalier is engaged in battle, but with what is hard to say.

2015-09-11,A New Concept Store in SoHo Boasts Basquiat — and Foosball,"Perched on a second-floor loft on Wooster Street, an ambitious new concept jewelry store brings high-end pieces — the kind you find around 50th Street, where Madison and Park Avenue giants like Tiffany’s reign — to SoHo. And it’s buying into the downtown, stay-awhile vibes of its neighboring shops. A custom-made Douglas Little light fixture hangs above a long dining table, not far from a shearling daybed, a dining room table, a custom foosball table and a kitchen. But the walls are lined with gold, silver and diamonds. “It’s unforced luxury,” says Rob Ronen, a co-owner, about the homey loft. “I want people to be able to come in, and, you know, enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of Champagne, not necessarily just to buy something. Just to hang out.” But if they are in the market, there’s no shortage of items to choose from: In addition to high-end jewelry and watches (Ronen, alongside the store’s other co-owner, Michael Herman, are authorized dealers for Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille), there are vintage watches, bought at auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s; custom-made furniture by designers such as Prouvé or Charlotte Perriand; and contemporary art, including works by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/t-magazine/material-good-jewelry-store-soho.html

2015-09-11,The First Day of College,"It is a late-summer rite: A convoy of shambling family vehicles descends on clean-scrubbed, iron-gated villages whose sole recent inhabitants, it would seem, have been lawn mowers and paintbrushes. The cars have license plates from distant places, clattering bike racks and the occasional cumbersome item (lacrosse stick? longboard?) secured to the roof with straps. Their interior contents are more disorderly still: typically a pair of adults well past the age of footloose road trips and a veteran teenager on the slippery cusp of a new world. The previous few years of test-taking, application-filing and hand-wringing have been aimed at learning the name and address of the site where this rift would occur. In short order the travelers will part ways; it’s a long-awaited, inescapable and horrible fact — and if all goes well, it will be more or less permanent. But fortunately, with so many families going through this drama at once, the ensuing chaos has a way of tempering emotions — at least initially.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/the-first-day-of-college.html

They talked with Air-Raid Precaution workers, demolition squads working on the debris of the latest raid and homeless people trying to salvage their belongings. Wherever they went, they were cheered by their people as their car, preceded only by a police guide car, made its way through shattered streets.

2015-09-11,Inside the List,"The Plague: Is there any way, at this point, to separate Jonathan Franzen’s work from his polarizing public image? Most readers will recall that Franzen’s fame problem began in 2001, when he openly squirmed after Oprah Winfrey picked his novel “The Corrections” for her book club, then escalated through no real fault of his own when media outlets (including The Times) hailed his 2010 follow-up, “Freedom,” as a masterpiece. Both were best sellers, but they also fostered an enthusiastic backlash among people who objected less to Franzen’s writing than to Franzen himself, as an emblem of literary ambition and elitism. (Laura Miller put her finger on this in a recent essay for The New Yorker’s website: “Franzen’s persona,” she wrote, “has its own audience, one that seems to derive great pleasure from hating it. Although his fiction is the occasion of his fame, it is now no longer necessary to have read any of it to have an opinion about Franzen.”)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Republican-controlled Legislature, in filing a lawsuit and seeking a temporary restraining order, said Mr. Walker had violated the State Constitution’s separation of powers provisions. The expansion will, among other changes, increase federal reimbursement to 100 percent from 50 percent for medically necessary travel for Medicaid-eligible Alaska Natives and American Indians receiving care in Indian Health Service facilities, which is a major medical expense and care concern in rural Alaska. The Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision, issued last week, not to halt the plan while the Legislature’s lawsuit proceeds.

It was the first day — ever — for the International Charter School of New York. And Mr. Levey, who had spent the last 36 months planning, developing and hiring for his new elementary school, was in high spirits. The kindergartners would be joined a few days later by 70 first graders. Ultimately, plans call for the school to run through fifth grade, educating students in topics that Mr. Levey cares about: how Francis Bacon developed the scientific method, why Aristotle matters and what led to the decline of the Roman Empire.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/nyregion/matthew-leveys-charter-school-quest.html

For a time beaming brighter even than Swifty Lazar, with his bald head, black-rimmed glasses and parties at Spago, Mengers inspired characters in “The Last of Sheila,” the shadowy cult movie with a screenplay by Anthony Perkins and Stephen Sondheim; and very likely also in the novels “Myra Breckinridge,” by her pal Gore Vidal, and “The Love Machine,” by Jacqueline Susann.

It’s the most intimate of subjects, involving privacy, comfort, childhood memories, somewhere clean and protected from the street and modern times, a woman’s own place.

In the next sentence, however, Didion tells the story of her 7-year-old daughter, who, on seeing one of O’Keeffe’s sublime “Sky Above Clouds” paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, runs toward it and whispers: “Who drew it? . . . I need to talk to her.” The longing to corroborate one’s own feelings with the facts of an artist’s life — the assumption “that the glory she saw in the work reflected a glory in its maker” — is a primal one, Didion suggests. But there is a paradox inherent in the encounter with art: Even as it may touch us acutely, it is essentially mysterious. It carries only a trace of its maker, and this is style. “Style is character,” Didion declares, throwing down the gauntlet: Find me if you can.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/books/review/the-last-love-song-a-biography-of-joan-didion.html

Eventually Highway runs into a man named Voragine (an abyss?) who helps him, and who later appears to be the person telling this story.

Same goes for blush (none) and mascara (transparent), which played to Wu’s particular kind of “polished” girl this season. Moments before curtain call, Yadim applied a ruby red powder pigment over a layer of Maybelline’s Vivid Matte Liquid in Rebel Red, for a deep, velvety appearance and texture — and a timeless, low-maintenance look for any season.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/t-magazine/jason-wu-backstage-beauty-report-fashion-week-spring-2016.html

That rejection at 19 led him to London to try his luck auditioning for the Drama Centre there. He had prepared an Iago monologue, had gone over it hundreds of times, but he was still nervous. He had been replaying the words of a director from one of the other drama schools, who had told him that he could recognize an actor from the way he enters a room. ‘‘I still hate that,’’ said Fassbender. Before the audition, he was trying to get the director’s words out of his mind. ‘‘I went to the urinal, and as I was pissing, I saw that someone had written ‘Hi, Cookie!’ on the wall. Those words were staring at me, as I stood there. I had just finished playing the Cook in a production of ‘Mother Courage,’ and I had done it with a Scottish accent. Cook; cookie. ‘I’ll do the Iago monologue in a Scottish accent,’ I decided, even though that wasn’t how I had prepared it.’’ After the audition, Fassbender was asked why he’d chosen that accent, to which he answered something about it being a way to bring mischief into the piece, which seemed true enough. ‘‘It’s funny. I haven’t thought about that for years and years. I’m not saying what I saw was a sign or anything. But maybe I did sort of take it that way, and that helped me.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/t-magazine/michael-fassbender-nobodys-fool.html

And while the Apple watch, which launched in April and sold an estimated 2.5 million units in its first quarter, is likely to affect those numbers, most traditional producers are taking their smart competition in stride. After all, they survived the ravages of the 1970s, when quartz technology made 60,000 watchmakers obsolete. Indeed, the Swiss are in the midst of a horological renaissance in which dedicated collectors wait years — and pay millions — for timepieces that make up for their lack of digital functionality with analog elegance and a promise: Given regular servicing, they’ll run in perpetuity.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/t-magazine/luxury-watches-by-the-numbers.html

The security firm Kroll reported that video shot by Officer Raymond Tensing’s body camera contradicts his central claim, that his arm was caught in Samuel DuBose’s car, and he was being dragged. It said Officer Tensing, who has been charged with murder, appeared to have his arm free, and the car had not moved, or had barely moved, when he fired at Mr. DuBose. Calling the shooting “entirely preventable,” the report faulted both men for needlessly escalating the situation before that point — Mr. DuBose by disobeying the officer’s instructions and restarting his car, as if to drive off. Kroll also said the university police were unsuited to street-level policing, especially off campus, and should consider narrowing their mission.

Presented by FringeArts in Philadelphia as part of the 2015 Fringe Festival, the work took over the Drexel University Armory, a space vast enough to accommodate its grand if minimalist proportions. Ms. Childs was among the revolutionaries of Judson Dance Theater in the 1960s, and like some of her fellow postmodernists she has found a more ardent audience — and more funding, presumably — in Europe than in the United States.

2015-09-14,What’s on TV Tuesday,"10:55 A.M. (Encore) SAVING MR. BANKS (2013) Tom Hanks stars as Walt Disney in this Disney movie directed by John Lee Hancock about the making of “Mary Poppins,” which at the time of its creation in the early 1960s was the most expensive live-action film the studio had produced. It eventually became one of the most beloved, too, and one of the biggest moneymakers. Emma Thompson is the author P. L. Travers, who conjured the magical nanny and is something of a crank. “I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons,” she says of her creation, lips pursed. There’s a back story, too, in which Travers is a little girl (Annie Rose Buckley) in a dusty Australian town, where her hopelessly alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) can barely hold on to his bank job. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this movie “part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious.” (Image: From left, Lily Bigham, Ms. Buckley, Ruth Wilson and Mr. Farrell.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Not in terms of politics — definitely not in terms of politics — but in terms of positioning? Mr. Scott, after all, is an oft-dismissed polarizing outsider who built his brand beyond the system by mocking fashion’s orthodoxies.

The Hebrew Bible speaks of six cities of refuge where someone who caused a death unwittingly would be protected from being killed in revenge. The Greeks allowed slaves who ran away from abusive masters and even some criminals to seek sanctuary in certain temples; ‘‘asylum’’ comes from their word for inviolable. According to legend, Romulus, the founder of Rome, extended asylum to people we would call migrants, choosing a spot between two groves on Capitoline Hill for his city’s temple of asylum. ‘‘A crowd of commoners, both free and enslaved, poured in from the neighboring territories, eager for new conditions,’’ the historian Livy wrote. ‘‘This was the first step towards the strength Romulus envisioned for Rome.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/magazine/who-qualifies-for-asylum.html

2015-09-16,What’s on TV Wednesday,"8 P.M. (TCM) BREATHLESS (1961) Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to the director Jean-Luc Godard, starting with this New Wave classic about two erratic days in the lives of star-crossed young lovers — Jean-Paul Belmondo, as a French hoodlum on the lam after killing a cop, and Jean Seberg, as an American expatriate newspaper vendor — living in Paris. As sordid as the film is, “and sordid is really a mild word for its pile-up of gross indecencies,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, it is no cliché — rather “more a chunk of raw drama, graphically and artfully torn with appropriately ragged edges out of the tough underbelly of modern metropolitan life.” The evening continues with “Pierrot le Fou” (1968), featuring Mr. Belmondo as an unhappily married man who abandons his bourgeois life for a crime spree with an ex-girlfriend (Anna Karina), at 10:15; “Masculin Féminin” (1966), about an aspiring writer (Jean-Pierre Léaud) who becomes involved with a rising pop star (Chantal Goya) and her roommates, at 12:15 a.m.; “Alphaville” (1965), in which a private investigator (Eddie Constantine) is sent to rescue a scientist from a future world ruled by computers, at 2:15; and “A Woman Is a Woman” (1964), about an exotic dancer (Ms. Karina) intent on finding a man to father a child, at 4.

She decided not to take the incident to any authority, and she eventually worked through the experience. The thought of working with the man who brought so much pain to a good friend is hard to swallow, but I do not know what the ethical thing to do is. It is not my story to share, and I do not want to bring the question to my friend for fear of opening old wounds. Am I allowed to share this information with the head of human resources?

The woman, a Mattel child-testing specialist named Lindsey Lawson, had sleek dark hair and the singsong voice of a kindergarten teacher.

Dance, the voice of the body, is in a distinctive position to contribute to this conversation, and that is especially true this week. Beginning on Tuesday, Sept. 22, at the Joyce Theater, Camille A. Brown presents “Black Girl: Linguistic Play,” which explores the broad spectrum of black female identity. Ms. Brown is a sharp storyteller, and here she illuminates her theme with infectious spirit by borrowing from the ritual of childhood games (through Sunday, Sept. 27). Starting on Wednesday, Sept. 23, Jaamil Olawale Kosoko, a Detroit-born Nigerian-American artist based in Brooklyn, brings “#negrophobia” to Gibney Dance, in which he considers the “erotic fear associated with the black male body” through a personal and a social lens (through Saturday, Sept. 26).

2015-09-17,What’s on TV Thursday,"9:40 A.M. (Starz Cinema) THE PATIENCE STONE (2013) In this film directed by Atiq Rahimi and adapted from his 2008 novel, a beautiful young Afghan woman (Golshifteh Farahani) confesses her fears, resentments and dreams to her comatose older husband (Hamidrez Javdan), a guerrilla fighter with a bullet in his neck. The film mirrors an Afghan myth that “had been told by women ‘as a healthy expression of their stifled feelings in a male-dominated world,’ ” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, quoting the folklorist Richard M. Dorson. Mr. Rahimi uses “universals (Man and Woman) as proxies in a battle that, as the story progresses, takes on an abstract quality,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “Yet while there may be truths in some universals, it’s hard to forget that this tale has its roots in a bitterly real world.” (Image: Ms. Farahani and Mr. Javdan.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Or to make a movie, for that matter. Technically, of course, a film isn’t really “there” until someone makes it, and “Everest,” a breathless, large-scale 3-D action spectacle (directed by Baltasar Kormakur) about an ill-starred attempt to scale the planet’s highest peak, was called into being with impressive star power and technical bravura. It definitely exists.

This question has been popping around my mind since I read Patrick deWitt’s new novel, “Undermajordomo Minor,” which is, let’s just say this straight out, quick and funny and thoughtful and moving and super. But what else is it? The book feels like a take on a certain genre — and let’s figure out what the genre is in a minute — but I’m suspicious of that phrasing, a take, which is often used to draw a divisive line. It is said, for instance, that Margaret Atwood does a take on science fiction and therefore is a literary writer instead of a science fiction writer, and then we wonder why there are so few science fiction writers who write as well as Margaret Atwood, while the science fiction writers glare at us and order another round. This is bad. “The Handmaid’s Tale” is science fiction and should not be disqualified as such on the grounds that it has good sentences and makes you think, as does the work of Patrick deWitt. Therefore, “Undermajordomo Minor” is a terrific piece of genre writing, and that’s that.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/patrick-dewitts-undermajordomo-minor.html

And if the show flopped, would we have to wait another two decades for a show about Asian-Americans? Eddie Huang, on whose memoir the show is based, had his own concerns about the story being repackaged as “pasteurized network television.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/magazine/constance-wu-is-making-her-way-in-hollywood.html

Culling from among over 50 projects Adjaye has built around the world, from libraries to private residences, museums, retail spaces and master city plans, “Making Place” highlights the threads and ideas that lead from one project to the next. “David is a fearless architect, an unconventional thinker, and he is committed to rethinking the possibilities of architecture,” says Zoe Ryan of the Art Institute, who co-curated the show alongside Okwui Enwezor, the Haus der Kunst’s director. It was a fruitful collaboration: “Okwui shows us the work through the lens of contemporary art and I am looking at things through the lens of design and architecture,” she explains.

2015-09-18,What’s On TV Friday,"9 P.M. (Starz) FURY (2014) An American tank crew — its leader, Sgt. Don Collier (Brad Pitt), a.k.a. Wardaddy, and his motley crew (Michael Peña, Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman) — fights its way across Germany in the spring of 1945 as the Nazis retreat toward Berlin in Hitler’s suicidal last stand. Children are conscripted and uncooperative parents murdered. And while the Allies may have momentum, the Germans still have plenty of tanks, many superior to the Americans’. David Ayer, whose drama is less an epic than a series of tense episodes, “has a way of filming violence that is both intense and matter-of-fact,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Like many other post-‘Saving Private Ryan’ combat movies, this one emphasizes the chaotic immediacy of battle, staking its claim to authenticity on the unflinching depiction of bloodshed: Heads are vaporized by mortar rounds. Limbs are severed by bursts of automatic-rifle fire. Human flesh is charred by flames and shredded by shrapnel. But within this gore-spattered, superficially nihilistic carapace is an old-fashioned platoon picture, a sensitive and superbly acted tale of male bonding under duress.” (Image: Mr. Lerman, left, and Mr. Pitt.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2015-09-18,Inside the List,"Female Acts: Chrissie Hynde’s rock ’n’ roll memoir, “Reckless,” about life as the lead singer of the Pretenders, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 7, taking its place in a wave of recent titles from the women of rock: Patti Smith’s “Just Kids,” which won the 2010 National Book Award, spent 46 weeks on the hardcover and paperback lists; Kim Gordon’s “Girl in a Band” logged a month this year; and Jewel’s “Never Broken” has just been released. Books are also on the way from Carrie Brownstein, Sinead O’Connor and others. “This is the era of the female act,” the former Rolling Stone editor (and current president of Blue Rider Press) David Rosenthal told The Washington Post this month. “Maybe that has caused overall a hunger for reading about female artists.” Maybe it has. But Hynde told The Post that gender isn’t a big part of the equation for her. “A good book is a good book. A good song is a good song,” she said. “Let me hear it, let me read it. I’m not very gender-driven.” Hynde grew up in a fairly conservative family in Akron, Ohio, and managed, apparently, to hide the more lurid elements of her rock ’n’ roll lifestyle from her mother and father. “I couldn’t have told this when my parents were alive,” she writes in a brief prologue to the memoir. “I would have had to leave out the bad language and tell a lot of lies about what I’d been doing all that time I was gone.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But she gets much of her inspiration and source material from far outside jazz. Not from pop or classical music or avant-garde traditions. But from music that she has to travel great distances to learn about, like Southern Taiwanese folk songs; or pansori, the South Korean musical storytelling tradition; or sindhenan, the improvisational singing of Javanese gamelan music. (A lot of the music she’s looking for has something to do with her own background: raised in Illinois, her parents are from Taiwan and East Timor.)

In “The Lost Landscape: A Writer’s Coming of Age,” she repeatedly ex­presses her doubts about first-person autobio­graphical writing. For one thing, she’s deeply wary of the confessional voice. For another, she has little faith in the reliability of memory. While she can vouch for the accuracy of “A Widow’s Story,” her 2011 account of the aftermath of her first husband’s death, which she based on contemporaneous journals, she can hardly back up this latest memoir with documentation. No small child, not even a Joyce Carol Oates, could be expected to take notes all day. Yet another problem: The memoirist is obliged to leave things out. “To charges of distortion,” she writes, “I can only say — mea culpa.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/the-lost-landscape-by-joyce-carol-oates.html

The United States could be heading for a dynastic collision, Clinton versus Bush.

(AMC) THE GREAT GATSBY (2013) Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the enigmatic millionaire Jay Gatsby, and Carey Mulligan portrays Daisy Buchanan, the object of his obsession, in Baz Luhrmann’s stylized musical take on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway, the Yale graduate — and, conveniently, Daisy’s cousin — renting the cottage next to Gatsby’s colossal Long Island mansion. “Despite what you may have heard, it is an eminently enjoyable movie,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film, which won Oscars for best costume and production design. Still, is the tale “a credible love story?” he asked. “Fitzgerald himself was not sure, but Mr. Luhrmann, Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Mulligan make it an effective one.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-09-21,1915: German Armies Occupy Vilna,"Vilna, capital of the Government of that name and the biggest city of Lithuania, has been occupied by the Germans. Details of the city’s fall have not yet been made known, but there is every reason to suppose that the Russian army of occupation has withdrawn intact. For the last few days, as the HERALD indicated yesterday, the fate of Vilna had been in the balance. The enemy occupying Molodetchno and Vidsy, Vilna was practically cut off from all railway communication, and its evacuation, generally regarded as imminent, had doubtless been fully prepared for by the Russian high command. The fall of Vilna, says the “Times” Petrograd correspondent, will facilitate a further German advance along the northern routes and will increase Russia’s difficulties in the matter of transport, both of men and munitions. No official Russian statement has yet been issued, but even the German newspapers do not suggest that the army defending Vilna has been captured. Its escape may therefore be taken for granted, but its position is still a somewhat dangerous one, for an important enemy force threatens its flank from the east. — The New York Herald, European Edition, September 21, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/1915-german-armies-occupy-vilna/

2015-09-21,What’s On TV Monday,"9 P.M. (Fox) MINORITY REPORT This new series, based on the 2002 Steven Spielberg film starring Tom Cruise, travels ahead to 2065, by which time Pre-Crime — the ability to know in advance that a crime will be committed through foreknowledge gathered by psychics — has long been abolished and a young “precog” named Dash (Stark Sands) is trying to lead a civilian life despite continuing visions of bloodshed. Meanwhile in Washington, a police detective (Meagan Good) and a mayoral candidate (Peter Van Eyck) are struggling with the return of murder. “ ‘Minority Report,’ the TV series, appears to come from an alternative universe: one in which ‘Minority Report,’ the movie, was never made,” James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times. “Taken on its own terms, then, ‘Minority Report’ is ... still not good,” he added. Though the future promises holographic phone calls, subway advertisements for marijuana goodies and the 75th season of “The Simpsons,” he wrote, “psychic powers make for dull detective work.” Season 2 of “Gotham,” which finds Detective Gordon (Ben McKenzie) seeking help from the Penguin after a shift in power at the Gotham City Police Department, leads in at 8.

2015-09-22,Philippines: Gunmen Abduct Foreigners," Four people — two Canadian men, a Norwegian man and a Filipino woman — were abducted on Monday night from a resort on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, the police said Tuesday. The victims were identified as John Ridsdel and Robert Hall, both of Canada, and Kjartan Sekkingstad of Norway. The identity of the Filipino woman has not yet been confirmed. The four were taken from the Oceanview Resort on Samal island, off the southern coast of Mindanao, about 11:40 p.m. Mindanao has been a frequent site of kidnappings and violence between government troops and several rebel groups, including Muslim extremists that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. But Monday’s kidnapping is the first abduction of foreign tourists in Mindanao in more than two years. In 2012, a Swiss national, Lorenzo Vinciguerra, and Ewold Horn, from the Netherlands, were abducted while bird watching off the coast of Mindanao. Mr. Vinciguerra escaped last December. Mr. Horn is still being held.  ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/world/asia/philippines-gunmen-abduct-foreigners.html

He was too timid in the first debate. He was too gimmicky in the second debate.

Slaughter’s criticisms of workplace policies and attitudes were not new, but her article had the force of her own belated awakening to the problem. A law professor, author and ­Princeton University dean (now president of the nonpartisan think tank New America), Slaughter had just spent two years as director of policy planning in the State Department under Hillary Clinton — a “dream job” that she initially hoped would lead to further advancement within the agency. But after two years of punishing work hours and a weekly commute between Washington and Princeton, where her husband was taking care of their two sons, Slaughter was surprised to find herself declining more State Department stints. Sometimes a job just couldn’t be squared with family responsibilities, she concluded. She returned to her full-time academic post at Princeton, which offered flexible hours more conducive to family life, and was more or less satisfied with her decision.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/anne-marie-slaughters-unfinished-business-women-men-work-family.html

As the story expands, we see the novel’s reality is even more disturbing: This is not a different universe, just a slightly exaggerated version of our own. A world where the working class has been pushed off the edge of the economic cliff, and the middle-class dream is alive only as a living nightmare. One of the last sustainable industries is the prison system. “Prisons used to be about punishment, and then reform and penitence, and then keeping dangerous offenders inside. Then, for quite a few decades, they were about crowd control — penning up the young, aggressive, marginalized guys to keep them off the streets. And then, when they started to be run as private businesses, they were about the profit margins for the prepackaged jail-meal suppliers and the hired guards and so forth.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/margaret-atwoods-the-heart-goes-last.html

There was an upstairs cafe and a butcher shop that displayed its wares in traditional fashion: Rows of carcasses hung above the entrance and across the front, so that in season it was almost comically festooned with dead game birds. Trays of trotters, liver and other kinds of offal completed the carnivorous tableau, usually arranged artfully around an obscenely grinning pig’s head.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/david-cameron-the-prime-minister-did-what-with-a-pigs-head.html

2015-09-23,"The Art, Drinks, Roads and Poems that Inspire Julia Holter","On paper, one could be forgiven for mistaking the music of the experimental pop singer Julia Holter for a particularly eclectic college syllabus. Over the course of Holter’s four albums, she’s taken inspiration from Euripides’s “Hippolytus” (her album “Tragedy”) and Frank O’Hara’s “Having a Coke With You” (her song “Moni Mon Ami”). On her last album, “Loud City Song,” Holter filtered contemporary celebrity through the lens of “Gigi,” a 1958 musical set in turn-of-the-century Paris, based on a novella by Colette. On her new record, “Have You in My Wilderness” (out Sept. 25 on Domino), however, Holter’s inspirations are less thematically unified — more free form — than in the past. “This record is less identifiable with influences,” she says. “It’s not that I don’t use a bit from books or legends or whatever, but each song is different; it’s not like I had loosely based the album on some kind of narrative.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/t-magazine/julia-holter-inspirations.html

Chiheb Esseghaier, 33, and Raed Jaser, 37, were convicted this year largely on the strength of secret recordings made by an F.B.I. agent who posed as an Egyptian-American real estate developer with radical Islamist views. Mr. Esseghaier, who is from Montreal, had repeatedly said he would not participate in the trial because he recognized only the laws of the Quran. Two psychiatrists concluded that Mr. Esseghaier probably has schizophrenia but differed on whether he was fit to stand trial. But Justice Michael Code of the Ontario Superior Court found that the man was not delusional at the time of the plotting. The judge also rejected Mr. Jaser’s defense that he had been entrapped and played along with the agent only to get money to feed his drug addiction.

This Friday, the retailer will launch the Stüssy Très Bien collection, a special collaboration that offers, in the words of Hannes, a more “minimalistic take on street- and sportswear.” There are boxy T-shirts, oversize shorts and a coach jacket with the towns “Laguna” and “Malmö” written on the back (the hometowns of Shawn Stüssy and the Hogeman brothers in California and Sweden, respectively). The collection feels like Stüssy at heart — it features skater-inspired styles with a tinge of Scandinavian refinement thrown in. “The designs came effortlessly, to be honest,” Hannes says. “It was more about removing details, changing the cuts and adding some fabrics that you may not usually get from Stüssy.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/t-magazine/stussy-mens-fashion-collaboration.html

Luis Moreno Ocampo, the court’s former chief prosecutor, served as the group’s “legal and strategic adviser,” Mr. Ismael said. Fatou Bensouda, the court’s current chief prosecutor, has condemned crimes by Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, but she has said that because those countries have not joined the court, it has no jurisdiction over matters that take place in Syria or Iraq. But Mr. Ismael said the involvement of Islamic State militants from countries that are court members, including Tunisia, Georgia and Australia, in such critical roles as training, fund-raising or organizing crimes against Yazidi women and girls might allow the court to proceed with an investigation.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/world/middleeast/iraq-yazidis-turn-to-international-court.html

(FXX) FLIGHT (2012) It’s hard to take your eyes off Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker, a crack airline pilot who manages to land a plane — at one point flying it upside down — after catastrophe strikes during a storm in this thriller from Robert Zemeckis. But Whip’s life takes a nose dive when an inquiry reveals his lust for drinking and drugs, and suggests that he may not have been sober during his heroic feat. “He’s high as a kite, and you may be, too, lifted by the contact high that great filmmaking gives you,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: “It’s no surprise that ‘Flight’ has salvation in mind. The shock is how deep Mr. Zemeckis and Mr. Washington journey into the abyss and how long they stay there. It can be tough for stars to play such unrepentantly compromised characters, as Mr. Washington does brilliantly here.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/arts/television/whats-on-television-friday.html

2015-09-25,Inside the List,"His and Hers, Part I: You could think of Lauren Groff’s third novel, “Fates and ­Furies” — new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 — as a sort of “Gone Girl” minus the murderous psychopathology. Both tell the story of a marriage first from the husband’s somewhat complacent perspective, then change course midway to reveal a wife far more active and vengeful than expected. But “Fates and Furies” is also, as the title suggests, a meditation on classical ideas of destiny and human agency, with the golden boy Lotto (short for Lancelot) representing submission to the Fates while his wife, Mathilde, rides with the Furies and shapes reality to her liking. I asked Groff which view she endorses, if either. “I wobble between action and somewhat optimistic fatalism,” she replied by email. “In the middle of the night, I side more with Ma­thilde’s pragmatic anxiety; during the slow, hot Florida daylight hours, I’m a little sunnier, a little more like Lotto. I thought, going into the book, that I was 89 percent Lotto, and this book is in some ways an elaborate apologia to my husband for often being wrapped up in my writing to the exclusion of actual life. But Mathilde is a terrifying sister of my heart, and I find myself in her in equal measure. It’s not exactly Flaubert’s ‘Madame Bovary, c’est moi.’ In truth both Lotto and Mathilde, c’est moi. I am both of them and neither of them in equal measure, and their lives and ambivalence and desires have elements of mine, all snarled up in this one big wild knot.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

There is a Humboldt glacier, a Humboldt asteroid, a Humboldt hog-nosed skunk.

My dad graduated from high school in the city that spring, and my mom would begin her senior year that fall.

Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson condensed Laura Hillenbrand’s 2010 best seller, “Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,” which covers the first 25 years or so of Mr. Zamperini’s life, into a 2-hour-17-minute screenplay. That’s still hardly enough time to cover each chapter in his life, and though Ms. Jolie does fine work throughout, the strain shows. Her “tendency to go David Lean in this material works against her,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “What the movie ends up in desperate need of is a sense of life made real and palpable through dreadful, transporting details, not a life embalmed in hagiographic awe.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Smith), a complex Muslim (Yasmine Al Massri) and a conservative gay recruit (Tate Ellington).

TV like ‘Quantico’ takes even more — it doesn’t do much to hide its borrowings,” James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times. “What remains to be seen is if ‘Quantico’ is no more than what it appears to be or if there’s a distinctive terror story underneath, like a mole with an exceptionally pretty disguise.” (Image: Ms. Chopra.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

2015-09-28,What’s on TV Monday,"6 P.M. (LMN) WINTER’S BONE (2010) Jennifer Lawrence, in the breakthrough role that earned her an Oscar nomination, portrays Ree Dolly, a teenager in the Ozarks of Missouri who goes in search of her meth-cooking father after he puts up the family home to cover his bail and disappears. But her efforts to find him place her in a terrible dilemma: either betray the code of silence that keeps her clan proudly on the wrong side of the law or face destitution. The harshness in Debra Granik’s “regional-realist morality tale,” based on Daniel Woodrell’s novel, “is not there to illuminate a sociological condition,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Something more primal, almost Greek in its archaic power, is at stake in ‘Winter’s Bone,’ and its visual and emotional starkness do not feel like simple badges of authenticity.” (Image: Ms. Lawrence.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-09-28,"‘Changing the Subject,’ by Sven Birkerts"," Sven Birkerts is an anxious man. By turns he is frightened, terrified, alarmed, filled with dread. On one occasion he shudders in his core; mostly he is just plain worried. What concerns him, a concern he is eager to transmit to us, is the rapid spread of computer, Internet and telephone technologies and more specifically what those technologies are doing to our minds. Forever glued to screens of one kind or another, clicking compulsively on the links others provide for us, we are losing the ability to concentrate, growing more itchy and agitated by the day, allowing our consciousness to be fragmented and dispersed. Our very selfhood is under threat as we are invited to think of achievement as a collective, rather than individual goal, a contribution to Wikipedia rather than a distinctive personal statement. At every step the Internet or GPS navigator puts us at a remove from the world and from our fellow human beings, deprives us of the agency we enjoyed when we had to go out and find things for ourselves rather than have them suggested to us. “Rewired,” as neuroscientists have now demonstrated, to adapt to the fitful back and forth of the web, our brains are no longer fit for the sustained attention that literature requires. Fewer young people are choosing to study the humanities. Fewer great works of art are being produced. There is a real risk of individuality being submerged in system. To make matters worse, a vast majority of people seem entirely happy with this state of affairs, to the point that anyone questioning the value of the new technologies is immediately deemed a Luddite if not a dinosaur.

She holds an endowed chair at M.I.T. and is on close collegial terms with the roboticists and affective-computing engineers who work there.

The online tools, which will be unveiled next year, would give students a place to store schoolwork, get advice, and collect information on colleges and financial aid and link it to the new application. If it is adopted by high schools and community groups, coalition members say, it could partly make up for the fact that many low-income students receive little guidance on getting into college. The simplified application would be an alternative to others now in use, like the Common Application, but would not replace them.

2015-09-29,What’s On TV Tuesday,"8 P.M. (Flix) VENUS (2006) The elderly actor Maurice (Peter O’Toole, in an Oscar-nominated performance) takes an interest in Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), the great-niece of his friend Ian (Leslie Phillips), who has arrived in London to care for her great-uncle — and perhaps break into modeling. Ian is horrified by Jessie’s working-class habits. Maurice, on the other hand, sees in her a target for his charm. “Their unlikely, uneven friendship provides the movie with a thin, wobbly dramatic peg, but it turns out to be just enough for Mr. O’Toole to show the younger guys out there — the Leos and the Brads and, for that matter, the Daniel Craigs — how the thing is done properly,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this meditation on age and beauty, directed by Roger Michell and based on a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi. In “Dirty Pretty Things” (2002), at 9:35, Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays a Nigerian doctor on the run who discovers an organ-smuggling ring while working illegally as a hotel porter in London. Audrey Tautou is his Turkish roommate, who pines for him. “ ‘Dirty Pretty Things’ plays it straight and cool,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times about this Stephen Frears drama. He added, “After watching Mr. Frears ply his refined skills in mainstream studio fare, it’s enthralling to see him employ that jazziness to spark his ticking impatience with injustice.” (Image: Mr. O’Toole and Ms. Whittaker.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Trump told me aboard his 757 as we were flying to the recent Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.

The commentator, Dylan Byers, was saying that Trump now ran the risk of ‘‘jumping the shark’’ because voters were becoming so familiar with his act. ‘‘Nah,’’ Trump said, smirking at the screen. As the real estate and reality-­show tycoon sees things, this is all win-win for him. Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal wrote something to this effect recently, Trump told me, explaining that even if he loses, ‘‘he goes back to being Donald Trump, but even bigger.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/donald-trump-is-not-going-anywhere.html

2015-09-29,How Will Cotton Gets His Friends Naked,"Upon walking through the double-wide metal doors of Highline Studio D in Chelsea last night, T heard something unexpected drifting through the industrial space: Seals & Croft’s laid-back yacht-rock anthem “Summer Breeze.” Once inside, the hazy soundscape made more sense, contextualized by the surreal sight of a live drawing session — complete with a D.J. and snacks. Reminiscent of a Hollywood set, three concentric rings of artists stood, sat and lounged with canvases, absorbed in the nude vignettes posed before them. In the center of it all, the artist Will Cotton, the evening’s magnanimous host and inspiration, stood before his own easel sketching the lithe forms. An annual, not to say ritualistic event for Cotton, his Drawing Parties have evolved into one of the New York Academy of Art’s most beloved regular fundraisers. A natural precursor to NYAA’s splashy “Take Home a Nude” fundraising gala, the invite-only session challenges a group of artists to revisit their art-school roots. “To me, this is so much better than calling up my friends and saying ‘Hey, this is a great school,’” Cotton explained. “This way we give them something — and then, if they want to donate, they can.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/t-magazine/new-york-academy-of-art-will-cotton-drawing-party.html

With the first one, a bunk-bed-appointed surf shack in Montauk, Christiansen realized that when the team came together (with breaks for surfing), the quality of work changed dramatically. “The work got very good during the summer when people were fishing, growing vegetables, cooking,” he says.

The detentions, which occurred in May, were reported as diplomats from Japan, China and South Korea were working to arrange a summit meeting for their leaders, and days after China arrested an American businesswoman, Phan Phan-Gillis, also accused of spying. Ties between Japan and China have been frayed over their wartime history and disputes over maritime territory. The Japanese foreign ministry declined to identify the detainees, both men, whose detention was first reported by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Asked if Japan had sent spies to China, a government spokesman said: “As a nation, we absolutely do not do that. I want to say the same thing to all countries.” Reuters quoted Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, as saying that the two were being held “in accordance with the law for engaging in espionage activities in China.” According to the newspaper, one man was taken into custody near a military facility south of Shanghai, and the other near the North Korean border. The Japanese broadcaster NHK said it was investigating reports that a third national may have been detained around the same time.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/world/asia/japan-china-detains-2-japanese-on-suspicion-of-espionage.html

MacArthur. In 1975 he stirred up controversy with “Sociobiology,” which revolutionized thought about animal societies, including that of humans.

As Eby tells it in “South Toward Home,” she arrived with a whimsical gift, a chocolate Easter bunny from the Dollar General. She knew what she wanted to tell the author, now 89 years old. “That I, too, had gone to New York City as a wide-eyed Alabama girl, hoping to write something true about the South, . . . its fiery strangeness and treasures and tangled past.” Alas, Lee was reported to be asleep.

2015-09-30,Recent History,"Middle-grade readers today are part of what’s becoming known as Generation Z, born between 1996 and 2011 (give or take a year or so on either end). As this newspaper has noted, they have by now their own generational sensibility: more Lorde than Lady Gaga, more Snapchat than Facebook. Growing up entirely in a digital era, they are more private, sensible and cautious than their Millennial elders. Perhaps that’s because they are being raised not by high-flying boomers but by Generation X, which one Times article calls “a relatively small, jaded generation that came of age in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam funk of the 1970s, when horizons seemed limited.” Much of the current helicopter-parenting phenomenon, it has been speculated, is a result of these Gen-Xers overcorrecting with their offspring for the strange and often jarring empty spaces that characterized their own 1970s childhoods. Back then, I think it is safe to say, “parenting” as a verb — a life-defining, life-consuming activity — had not been invented, even as the world had become more treacherous for children to navigate. It seems appropriate, then, that one of the best books I have yet read about growing up in the 1970s is a graphic novel for middle-grade readers: “Sunny Side Up,” by Jennifer L.

But modern Bologna is not just about the past. Dozens of cool new attractions have changed the face of the city, from new ways of eating to new museums and new bars.

Strictly speaking, “Rothschild & Sons,” which begins performances on Tuesday, Oct. 6, at the York Theater Company, is not a thoroughly new show. It’s being described as an “intimate one-act reimagining” of “The Rothschilds,” the 1970 musical, with a book by Sherman Yellen, about the Jewish dynasty that rose from obscurity and oppression in late 18th-century Germany and became a banking powerhouse. Mr. Yellen is also, happily, still with us. He has restructured his book to focus on the relationships among the patriarch, Mayer Rothschild, played by Robert Cuccioli, his wife and their five sons. The score will include some previously unheard Bock-Harnick songs and others revised by Mr. Harnick. For musical theater lovers, this makes for a must-have ticket.

Here, finally, is a recording of this epically proportioned forgotten treasure, written in 1927 in Philadelphia by Ornstein, a Ukrainian-born piano virtuoso and composer who died in 2002 at the age of 108. Ornstein goes for the jugular in the febrile outer movements, shot through with Russian folk material and rhythmic fire, but offers respite in the achingly tender Andante Lamentoso. His nervous, simmering String Quartet No. 2, written around 1929, is another interesting document of Ornstein’s late Romantic style, but it’s the Quintet that now ought to be picked up by intrepid performers and presenters and given its due in the chamber music canon.
