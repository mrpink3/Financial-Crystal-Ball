I cried, hard enough that the sobbing impaired my vision, hard enough that my poor mother leaned over and asked if we should leave. She thought I was unhappy, but I wasn’t. Not at all. Once E.T. is finally rescued and Elliott, his brother and their friends go sailing through the sky, I kept crying. As high up as they were, I was higher.

Now,  this restaurant in the Hotel Chelsea on West 23rd Street, one of the city’s oldies — it first opened in 1930 — will open its doors again this week. (It closed in 2018 when the hotel’s renovations began.) The hotel will also reopen this month, but the restaurant is ready now, its size reduced from the original 220 seats to around 65. Sunday Hospitality, the owners of Sunday in Brooklyn, is running it with Charles Seich, a new partner here, and the company’s culinary director and partner, Jaime Young, is in charge of the food. At his side is the chef de cuisine Byron Hogan, who cooked in Spain for the past 12 years, mostly in Madrid, and moved to the United States to work here. “We want to make it authentic, looking more to the north of Spain with the Basque Country and Galicia,” Mr. Young said. Without straying far from the traditional, the chefs have come up with a dish that combines boquerones and oil-cured anchovies, a combination of preserved tuna with leeks and tomato, and squid with morcilla sausage. The paella for which the restaurant has long been known is now made mostly with seafood and also rabbit. The portions are not as massive as in the old days, but that era is evoked by pitchers with red and white sangrias. Spain dominates the wine list, and there are sherries, gins, vermouths and ciders. Burgundy leather, wrought iron, dark wood and a recently uncovered tile floor define the space, with a bar, a few tables and intimate booths. Later this year, Sunday Hospitality will open a French American bistro in the hotel. (Opens Wednesday) ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Bialystok at once “grows silent and speaks” and is “stocked with soldiers in the amount of one.” Even the poem’s title describes the morning as “Sunny” while the first line foretells the killing: “My half-baked flesh.” In this poem, Bialystok is filled with ghosts who are still trying to speak, warning us about the perils of war and inhumanity. We just need to hear and listen to the past. Selected by Victoria Chang",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/magazine/poem-a-sunny-morning-in-the-square.html

2022-02-10,The Radical Experimentation of Black Psychedelia,"IN DECEMBER OF 1968, the TV show host Ed Sullivan introduced the group Sly and the Family Stone onto his stage. An ensemble of seven Black and white men and women in sequined blazers, platinum wigs and vinyl vests, they played a rapid-fire medley of their most affirming hits: “Everyday People,” “Dance to the Music,” “Sing a Simple Song,” “I Want to Take You Higher.” They had just released their third studio album, “Life” (1968), and everyone looks excited, although Sly Stone alone appears confident that the whole thing will come off. We see why when he leaves the organ and heads out into the studio audience with his sister Rose: After her solo, he performs a dance routine drawn from Africa, patting juba. “We look like we just landed in a spaceship from Venus,” the group’s original drummer, Greg Errico, tells me of the clip. Men in the audience are wearing suits that “weren’t even cool suits — they look like accountants.” Before heading back to the stage, Stone finds what may have been the one Black man in the crowd and slaps him five. If the group couldn’t make any more time for themselves (hence their pack-it-all-in medley), they could make a little more space and, for a moment, paint it Black.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/t-magazine/black-psychedelia.html

The most recent hotel addition, Hoshino Resorts’ KAI Poroto, which opened last month, is located on Hokkaido’s southwestern coast near the new Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park. Guests of the ryokan hotel — which consists of 42 rooms that each look out onto Lake Poroto (poroto ko means “big lake” in the Ainu language) — can spend the day immersing themselves in Hokkaido’s Indigenous history through the museum’s various exhibitions, before returning to the resort for a dip at either of the two bathhouses — one of which features a ketunni (or “tripod-frame”) design — with their alkaline waters rich in humic and fulvic acids. For travelers hoping for a sportier trip, head northwest a couple of hours to Niseko and book a stay at Raku Suisan, an intimate ryokan at the foot of four of the town’s famed ski resorts. With views of Mount Yotei and Mount Annupuri, each of the hotel’s 18 rooms offers a private open-air hot-spring bath.

In September, the Sackler family, which was behind the OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma and helped create this overdose epidemic, finally agreed to disband the company and to pay a settlement of $4.5 billion. That may sound like a whopping amount of money, but as the journalist Patrick Radden Keefe points out, it’s arguably not. He profiled the Sacklers’ rise in his book “Empire of Pain” and points out: “They’re paying it out over nine years; they have an $11 billion fortune. They can just pay it with the returns.” Plus, as part of the settlement, the Sacklers were granted sweeping immunity from opioid-related lawsuits. (In December, a federal judge overturned this decision, saying the family could not be released from civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. Purdue Pharma is appealing.)",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-patrick-radden-keefe.html

Lycopene is the pigment that makes tomatoes red and watermelons pink, so it is commonly and safely consumed.” The pineapples are sold without leaves because the crowns are used to propagate the fruit.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/dining/del-monte-pinkglow-pineapples.html

Across 32 years and more than 1,200 episodes, the original series and its six American spinoffs have offered a gentle critique of law enforcement, presenting a parade of flawed individuals navigating a byzantine justice system. Detectives are stymied by bureaucrats and squabble with lunkhead patrol officers, who reliably contaminate crime scenes. Idealistic prosecutors grow disillusioned and leave for nonprofit work. And yet the franchise still hinges on a lesser-of-two-evils logic: The institutions may be imperfect, and the cops imperfect, but their vocation is, by definition, good. There are always more victims to avenge, and none better equipped to do it than the New York Police Department.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/magazine/law-order-svu-organized-crime.html

2022-02-16,See (the Worst People in) the World!,"It was the German shepherd in Row 4 that finally pushed Veronica, a flight attendant, over the edge. He was Veronica’s third ‘unruly passenger,’ as the Federal Aviation Administration calls them, in one month. A week or two before the dog, a middle-aged man reacted belligerently when, just before he boarded the plane, Veronica asked him to pull up his mask. ‘Who do you think you are, you liberals?!’ he screamed at her. ‘These masks don’t work.’ Then he threatened to punch her in the face. About a week before, it was a group of young female athletes. The girls kept removing their masks when they talked to one another, and Veronica, who was working the back of the plane near the girls, repeatedly reminded them: “Please put your mask on.” (She and most other attendants asked me not to use their full names, either because an airline’s media policy does not allow them to speak without permission or for fear that doing so might hinder their employment.) “Please put your mask on,” a girl mocked Veronica each time she said it. When the girl got up to go to the bathroom, without a mask, Veronica asked again. The girl, who was about 5-foot-10 and towered over Veronica’s 5-foot-2 frame, said: “I’m so sick and tired of you, bitch. You don’t have authority over me.” They were almost body to body in the cramped area near the lavatory, and Veronica feared the girl was about to hit her, before one of the coaches intervened.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/magazine/flight-attendants-covid.html

This week the dish that isn’t quite like the others — thriller, mystery, memoir or biography, and so forth — is Jennifer Raff’s “Origin,” which our reviewer described as a “masterly retelling of the story of how, and when, people reached the Americas.” Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, writes in her introduction, “Looking at the genetic evidence, we will examine the ways in which DNA has challenged and changed our understanding of Native American history, with a special focus on the events that are only indirectly understandable with the archaeological record.” Her approach will be accessible to the pickiest readers, layering personal anecdotes with a visit to a gene-sequencing lab, heavy on compassion and light on jargon. A Goodreads reviewer put it like this about Raff: “As a young mother she can’t help but impart some poignancy in her accounts of those burial sites where toddlers are interred. In doing so she highlights — as she does throughout the book — the humanity of the person whose remains are the subject of research.” “Origin” is Raff’s first book, and it lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/books/review/origin-jennifer-raff.html

Initially, the style is stifling, giving the sense that the wallpaper might matter more than the plot. One room is painted solid pink, with matching pink house plants and a pink broom.

The golden color of Chanel No. 5, which could be seen through the simple square-corner glass bottle — designed to contrast with the ornate cut crystal vessels made by Lalique and Baccarat at the time — was almost as important as its bouquet. That warm yellow hue and the dizzying waft of sillage in its wake were among the things that inspired Patrice Leguéreau, who directs the house’s fine jewelry studio, to render the radically modern scent in gem form. Resembling a flower exploding into bloom with a five-carat emerald-cut diamond as its luminous pistil and stamen, surrounded by a cascade of yellow sapphires and orange spessartite garnets, this captivating ring manages the impossible: turning the fleeting frisson of fragrance into an eternal object of desire.

2022-02-18,A Pair of Diamond-Encrusted Leopards From David Webb’s Menagerie,"Born in 1925 in North Carolina, the jewelry designer David Webb grew up idolizing his grandfather, an engraver, and at 14 began apprenticing under his uncle, who was a jewelry maker. Three years later, Webb left the South to make a name for himself in Manhattan, where the brand was officially established in 1948 with a shop on West 46th Street. By the late ’50s, Webb, who collected children’s books on wild beasts and made weekly pilgrimages to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to study Scythian and ancient Egyptian gold artifacts, had become best known for his enameled animal pieces. Banishing barnyard and household creatures from his jewels, the designer, who died in 1975 at the age of 50, favored a far more exotic and mythical menagerie of big cats, zebras, frogs and more. His creations — from compacts shaped like tortoises to carved coral bracelets inspired by the Hindu makara sea dragon — were coveted by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Vreeland and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and were, as one society reporter wrote, “as essential as the food and drink at La Grenouille to the fashion society clan.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/t-magazine/david-webb-leopard-earrings.html

The City Press states that owing to the fact that the Queen does not desire to undergo the fatigue of leaving her carriage and ascending the steps of the cathedral, the service will be held on the western steps, The Royal carriage being drawn up in the open space before the West front. The Westminster Gazette says such a service would be unique in the annals of the City Cathedral. “Meanwhile,” writes a representative of that paper who has been making inquiries, “it would be injudicious to assume the accuracy of the foregoing statement, seeing that nothing has, as yet, been decided on the subject whatever, and so far as the Cathedral authorities are concerned, at all events, it is very doubtful whether they would lend their approval to any such scheme as that foreshadowed, the objections to which, it is urged, are many and serious.

With that shift—and the massive and ever-swelling bureaucracy that came with it—the presidency had changed too; what for much of America’s first two centuries had been the office tasked with executing policy and spending money decided and set by Congress had seen that power dynamic reverse and instead now piloted the national agenda itself. It was a job now far too big for one man, even as the White House absorbed, stole, and agglomerated still more power and personnel. To Nixon, figuring out how to staff the oversized presidency—whom to trust, how to inspire them and manage them—consumed far too much energy. “It would be god damn easy to run this office if you didn’t have to deal with people,” he lamented.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/books/review/watergate-a-new-history-by-garrett-m-graff-an-excerpt.html

2022-02-22,Fasano Opens in the Former Four Seasons Space,"For this new restaurant, the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld has not radically disrupted his design for the Four Seasons 2.0, which briefly occupied the space until 2019. He repeated the tawny tones of the wood-paneled main dining room, but now the floor is carpeted, the lighting is softer and wood dividers separate some tables. It is the first New York restaurant for the Fasano Group, a restaurant and hotel powerhouse based in São Paulo, Brazil. (Mr. Weinfeld has designed a number of the group’s many properties.) Gero Fasano, who runs the company in partnership with the developers JHSF, said the new restaurant had to be warmer, more appealing and better for sound. The food is expense-account Northern Italian, mostly traditional and often elaborate, including bollito misto dispensed from a silver cart. The former bar in the front room is now a more informal osteria with linen place mats instead of tablecloths, a huge bar along the windows and a somewhat simpler menu written on smoky mirrors (think spaghetti with tomato sauce and no risotti). The wine selection is global. There is no art on the walls in the dining areas. In late March, outdoor seating will be added, and, upstairs in a few months, there will be a spacious cabaret. Mr. Fasano’s company was founded in 1902 when his Milanese great-grandfather emigrated to Brazil. The family was in and out of the restaurant business over the decades until Mr. Fasano, against the advice of his father who made his fortune in distilleries, plunged in and has applied his exacting standards ever since. The executive chef, Nicola Fedeli, a Florentine who has worked with the company for several years, adheres to Mr. Fasano’s strict demands as to preparation and presentation. There’s no New York-style salad on top of the oversize, impossibly thin $70 veal Milanese; it’s served on the side lest the veal get soggy.

Containers are supplied to the restaurants at no charge; customers, who pay a 99-cent fee added to their bills, can return them to any restaurant in the company’s network. The polypropylene plastic containers, which can be microwaved and withstand a commercial dishwasher, are cleaned and reused by the restaurants. Late last year, DoorDash and Caviar signed on for what Mr. Farbiarz said was a pilot program, and began offering the containers as an option when an order is placed at participating restaurants on their platforms. Now there are nearly 150 restaurants in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens on the list.

They’re calling it an Irish old-fashioned; garnish with a slice of fresh ginger. It sold out quickly when it was introduced in 2019 on a limited basis on Flaviar, an online spirits club, and it’s now being sold in liquor stores in New York. It was inspired by a Revolutionary War-era recipe and named for an 18th century Irishman, a tailor, who emigrated to New York and also spied on the English.

The group is often credited with anticipating both performance and conceptual art and is perhaps best known for Saburo Murakami’s “Laceration of Paper” (1955), for which he ran through a series of paper screens at speed, his body punctuating each surface like a torpedo. Matsutani was accepted into Gutai in 1963, when he was only 26 years old, on account of his vinyl-glue works — canvases with protrusions of dried glue that resembled, as the text accompanying his first solo show put it, “nipples, blisters or swelling from a burn.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/t-magazine/takesada-matsutani-hauser-wirth.html

But they remain a rarity in team sports. So the play’s conversations around excellence, sexuality and the boundaries between public and private lives, should still make it around the bases.

Pulling back support for the economy may help reduce inflation, but it also could weigh on economic growth if consumers reduce their spending.

At Noma they’ve turned to koji and mushrooms instead of fermented fish to create their umami-rich smoked mushroom garum. It’s not as intensely salty as some other garum-adjacent products, and the aroma and flavor reveal subtle smoke and mushrooms. There are recipes on the website. I tried the smoked mushroom cream sauce, dividing the recipe in half to complete it with and without the smoked mushroom garum.

2022-02-28,Need an Irish Whiskey Primer? Trust the Dead Rabbit.,"After nearly a century in the shadows, Irish whiskey is rebounding toward its former dominance. It’s all explained by David Wondrich, a drinks scholar and writer, who details the trajectory and the evolution of Irish bars in the United States since the 17th century in his foreword to “Paddy Drinks: The World of Modern Irish Whiskey Cocktails.” The book, by most of the partners in the Dead Rabbit, an esteemed bar in Lower Manhattan, is an up-to-date treatise on the whiskey, defining its four styles: pot still, malt, grain and blended. There are details for about 50 labels, and the book serves as a technical primer on Irish whiskey cocktails and how to build them. Following recipes for six classics, there are scores of Dead Rabbit creations, most of which call for esoteric ingredients like tonka bean syrup, za’atar tincture and toasted fennel salt (recipes are provided). There are a few more pantry-friendly options, like the head bartender Jillian Vose’s deliciously bitter Broadway Junction and the Precision Pilot, which she said was one of the first drinks she created at the bar.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/dining/the-dead-rabbit-book.html

The company was founded by Jumana Jacir, a designer who employs local people to obtain components from nearby farms and create their products. The za’atar is a brighter green with a somewhat mintier flavor than most; the tahini (tahiniyeh) has a more fluid consistency, making it easier to drizzle and to use for dressings; and the shatta chile paste comes in both a forcefully spicy and red version, like harissa, and in a somewhat milder and denser green version seasoned with za’atar that can be nicely mellowed by mixing it with olive oil.

The shorter blade is slightly more curved at the tip and the shape borrows aspects of a Japanese santoku, so it’s wider than a Western chef knife, a useful feature. Eytan Zias and Ron Khormaei, who founded the company in 2020, said they “do not make any shapes which are classically French, Japanese or German, but rather design the knives in a practical way that makes sense to us and are most effective for the user.” They also point out that the United States does not have the defined traditions of other countries known for cutlery, so it’s easier to innovate. The knife sharpens easily, has a dark patina, a deep bolster and a beautiful if somewhat heavy handle of Oregon big leaf maple burl.
