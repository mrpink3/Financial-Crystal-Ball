In Hirst’s experience, four-leaf clovers are more prevalent in the spring before the first mowing. Beginners should scan the edge of a patch, where the plants are less dense. Don’t get up close and start counting individual leaves. Instead, visually skim for what Hirst calls “ruptures in the pattern” — a four-leaf clover makes the shape of a square, while the typical three-leaf version appears as a triangle.

The French director Claire Denis is known for making independent movies that tell intimate, personal stories. But on paper, her first English-language film, “High Life,” doesn’t necessarily shout “intimate.” It’s a sci-fi movie, for one thing, and it accordingly takes place in about the most vast setting possible: space. Robert Pattinson stars as Monte, a young man who has agreed to participate in an extraterrestrial mission in order to avoid the death penalty. He’s traveling on a spaceship as part of a small criminal crew, bound for a black hole in deep space. Also on the ship is a troubled doctor played by Juliette Binoche; other crew members are played by Lars Eidinger and the musician André Benjamin. Their mission is derailed, in part, by an unexpected birth. “As is often the case in Denis’s movies, ‘High Life’ vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “But,” she added, “too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard — outer and inner space, Pattinson’s head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then — more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/arts/whats-on-tv-thursday-high-life-and-the-iheartradio-music-festival.html

2019-10-04,9 New Books We Recommend This Week,"School is back in session, which for some people means packing lunchboxes and anguishing over outfits in the morning dark, and for other people means muttering about the bus traffic snarling Main Street on the way to the gym. For us, though, back-to-school time is just one more reason to celebrate good books. This week, that includes books about school: Robert Pondiscio’s “How the Other Half Learns,” about a year in the life of the impressive but polarizing charter school network Success Academy, and Paul Tough’s “The Years That Matter Most,” looking at college through the lens of a class system that reinforces its own rigid hierarchy. There’s also Samantha Power’s memoir, “The Education of an Idealist,” which is less about school than about Power’s on-the-job evolution as President Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations. Two books this week tackle prejudice head-on — Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist” and Bari Weiss’s “How to Fight Anti-Semitism” — while Corey Robin’s “The Enigma of Clarence Thomas” upends some conventional wisdom about the Supreme Court justice. Finally, in fiction, we recommend new novels from some old favorites: Ann Patchett, Jacqueline Woodson and the British master Andrew Miller. Don’t think of them as required reading — nobody likes a syllabus — but maybe sneak one of them inside your calculus textbook and enjoy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/books/review/9-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2019-10-04,An Artist Who Pushes the Borders of His Studio Into the Streets,"In 2013, the South African-born artist Robin Rhode, whose interdisciplinary practice blends drawing, performance and photography, converted a 19th-century alcohol distillery in Berlin into a vast 16,000-square-foot work space, split across two floors. Still, he continues to make much of his work outside its bounds. While he produces most of his preparatory drawings in Berlin, his primary site of creation has remained in Westbury, a suburb of Johannesburg. There, using the plastered concrete wall of a vacant building as his canvas, he makes fleeting paintings (a shoal of small geometric shapes for the 2012 series “School of Fish,” a spiral staircase for the 2017 work “Principle of Hope”), and invites a performer wearing a mask — oftentimes the dancer Kevin Narain, a collaborator of eight years — to interact with the work, contorting his body to echo its shapes. He captures the dancer’s actions in a sequence of photographs and then scrubs the wall clean in less than 24 hours (although he leaves the vacant building as he found it, he also gives its owner a bottle of whiskey whenever he’s in town). For Rhode, the ephemerality of the movements and the reactionary nature of graffiti art underline the overlooked poverty and injustice permeating urban slums in cities; often he will work with more than a dozen local collaborators on a single piece. “My community are my studio assistants,” he says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/t-magazine/robin-rhode-artist.html

Season 6 concluded with a former K.G.B. agent (played by Laila Robins) plunging a syringe into Reddington, watching as her associates put him into the back of a van and made off with one of Reddington’s characteristic fedoras for good measure. The seventh season kicks off Friday, and picks up from there. “There will be an episode of ‘The Blacklist’ that is just fun and another that is very intense and then another that is rather ruthless and brutal,” Spader told The New York Times last year. “I still love the element of surprise, even for myself.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-the-blacklist-and-raising-dion.html

In addition to starring alongside Natalie Portman in the new film “Lucy in the Sky,” which follows an astronaut’s struggle to readjust to life on Earth after traveling into space, Domingo recently appeared on HBO’s “Euphoria” and is a co-writer of the acclaimed “Summer: Donna Summer the Musical,” which is currently on tour across the U.S. When he’s crafting narratives for any of his projects, whether he’s in front of the camera or behind the scenes, he often returns to the words of his favorite writers. “Poems influenced my love of craftsmanship in telling a story,” he says, “whether in short prose or long form.” The works he revisits again and again have in common “rich language, impeccable phrasing, soul stirring images, and wit,” he says, and so it makes sense that for T’s video series “Read T a Poem,” he chose to recite a work by the South Korean-born American writer Ed Bok Lee, whose insightful, exacting poems reflect the intimate ways globalization is transforming our culture and our lives. Domingo’s selection, “Summer Open Window,” is from Lee’s latest collection, “Mitochondrial Night,” which uses DNA as a central theme in its lyrical exploration of genealogy, geography and time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/t-magazine/colman-domingo-poem.html

In the midst of this activity, American and British operatives planned to dig a tunnel underneath the city, to intercept communications headed to and from Moscow. In “Betrayal in Berlin,” Steve Vogel, a former longtime reporter for The Washington Post, tells the story of the tunnel’s creation. He also delves into the life of George Blake, a British spy who became a double agent for the Soviets, reporting to them about, among other things, the progress of the tunnel project. Born in the Netherlands, Blake lived an outsize life of both great bravery and great deception. Below, Vogel talks about being inspired by his father’s work for the C.I.A., the similarities between spies and journalists, and tracking down Blake for an interview.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/books/betrayal-berlin-steve-vogel-interview.html

It was both a daunting and heady opportunity for Berlin to reinvent itself and start over. Artists and musicians moved into abandoned breweries, warehouses and basements and slowly brought new life to neighborhoods like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, which in turn attracted people from around the world. But now, thanks to rising rents, Berlin’s gentrified areas have become too expensive for many of its creative residents, and people have begun to move to farther-flung corners of the city. Three such neighborhoods are the historically industrial areas of Treptow-Köpenick, Rummelsburg and Oberschöneweide, 10 or so miles southeast of the city center, where some of Berlin’s most pioneering artists now occupy a string of former industrial buildings along the Spree River. It is in Oberschöneweide, too, that the Berlin gallerist Johann König, who represents several artists who have moved their studios to the area, is currently negotiating to take over and revive an old cable factory that will host artist studios and residencies. Although the area’s landscape may look post-apocalyptic, with its giant weeds and empty power plants, strangely, the future here can seem positively Arcadian: Real estate is still cheap enough that artists are able to buy, rather than rent, their spaces. Here, four artists discuss how their work is shaped by the Spree.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/t-magazine/berlin-artists-spree-river.html

How, and Why, Artists Exchange Work","IN 1966, BOB DYLAN visited Andy Warhol’s Factory studio in Midtown Manhattan and sat — saturnine, gnostic, impossibly young — for a Screen Test, one of the short film portraits Warhol started making in 1964 of a number of celebrities, including Dennis Hopper and Edie Sedgwick. Star-struck by his subject, Warhol offered Dylan a painting: a 1963 silk-screened portrait of Elvis Presley, of whom Dylan once said, “Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.” (The portrait, ironically, is taken from a publicity still of Elvis from the Western film “Flaming Star,” in which he looks very sheriff-like.) Dylan accepted the painting — but was then faced with the problem of maneuvering the nearly seven-foot-long canvas into his station wagon. Finally, he tied it to the roof with the help of his friend, the filmmaker Barbara Rubin. Later, when the artist asked Dylan about the painting, the musician admitted that he’d given it to his manager. “But if you gave me another one, Andy, I wouldn’t make that mistake again,” Dylan reportedly said. Only later did Warhol find out that Dylan had traded the canvas for a sofa. The painting now hangs in New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The last so-called “Ferus Type” Elvis to appear at auction — Warhol made 23 of them in total — was sold at Christie’s for $53 million in May.

There are a few pastas, and main dishes include Berkshire pork tenderloin, king salmon with corn pudding, sea scallops with whipped celery root and asparagus, and a burger.

When the 14th season of this long-running fantasy series ended, three of its main characters — Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Castiel (Misha Collins) — were left standing in a graveyard, surrounded by zombies. So the fact that the new 15th season is also the show’s final one may not bode particularly well for them. That undead death trap was one element of an apocalypse set into motion; can the heroes fight it off, or will the end of “Supernatural” also mean the end of its world?",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-supernatural-and-annabelle-creation.html

2019-10-10,36 Hours in Milwaukee,"Milwaukee has gone by many nicknames over the years: Cream City, Brew Town, the German Athens. But a lesser-known, more local handle — Smallwaukee — may best capture the personality of this Wisconsin city of 600,000, which can feel like a small town in big-city clothing, embodying the advantages of both. The fortunes of the Bucks and Brewers are followed in unpretentious taverns that wouldn’t feel out of place on a rural crossroads, and traditional meat-and-potato eateries are as patronized as the latest farm-to-table restaurant. The sleek new Hop streetcar line can take you to the Milwaukee Public Market, with its array of local foodstuffs, or within walking distance of the Santiago Calatrava-designed Milwaukee Art Museum, one of the most beautiful repositories of art in the world. Smallwaukee will grow very large indeed next July when the Democratic National Convention descends upon the city, with downtown’s new Fiserv Forum as its epicenter. The convention’s choice is sneakily apt. Terms like progressivism and democratic socialism, which add crackle and spark to today’s national political conversation, are not academic concepts here. The city elected Socialist mayors for 38 of the last century’s 100 years, and sent the first Socialist, Victor Berger, to the House of Representatives in 1910.

Less common, though, is the layout of the couple’s building; to reach the home of Gohar, a Cairo-born artist, and Sosa, a Barcelona-born graphic designer and publisher who co-founded the interiors magazine Apartamento, you must first enter a former tenement built in the mid-19th century on a now-bustling stretch of Spring Street, just west of the Bowery, then walk down a narrow, dimly lit hallway that opens into a 400-square-foot courtyard densely planted with laurel and vivid green birch trees. At the opposite end, down a leaf-strewn brick path, you’ll find a four-story red brick structure. Dating to that same period, it is one of New York’s so-called backhouses, the smaller residences that landlords erected in the 19th century behind the cover of larger buildings to increase rent revenue. Despite its origins, the building, which now has five units, is calm and oasis-like. At once hemmed in and bucolic, it evokes the dwelling in Virginia Lee Burton’s 1942 children’s book, “The Little House,” the looming metropolis pressed up against it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/t-magazine/laila-gohar-omar-sosa-apartment.html

2019-10-11,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Our recommended books this week take readers far away from New York City and its environs, with settings from Uruguay to Israel to the American Midwest and the small-town South. Ben Lerner’s new novel, “The Topeka School,” finds the seeds of our current social dysfunction in 1990s Kansas. Carolina De Robertis’s new novel, “Cantoras,” follows a group of lesbian friends living under a repressive Uruguayan regime. And Tom Segev’s biography “A State at Any Cost” explores the ways that Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, set that country on its path, for better and worse. We also offer some crime books, both fiction and non, along with a political history, a collection of poetry and a modern master’s horror stories. (That would be Paul Tremblay’s “Growing Things” and not Mike Isaac’s “Super Pumped” — a study of Uber’s business model that amounts to a horror story of its own.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/books/review/10-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2019-10-11,An Artist Who Works to Lana Del Rey and the Hum of Cable News,"Jacolby Satterwhite has spent the past decade making highly wrought digitally animated science-fiction worlds and irreverent modern dance pieces that draw on vogueing and martial arts. But he considers his two current shows, in New York and Philadelphia, to be “the final draft, conceptually, of what I was trying to say for years.” While Satterwhite has long been known as an art-world generalist, his fall exhibitions show him at his most direct. At Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, the exhibition “You’re at Home” brings together his digitally animated video series “Birds in Paradise” (2017-19), in which folkloric motifs and symbols of American consumerism tumble into a video-game world, and his 3D-printed objects, such as coin purses and jewelry boxes, based on drawings made by his mother, Patricia Satterwhite, before her death in 2016. Meanwhile, at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, the show “Room for Living” features a group of works Satterwhite developed during his recently completed two-year residency at the museum. They include figurative sculptures inspired by virtual objects from his video series “Reifying Desire” (2011-14), in which Satterwhite’s own digitally animated avatar navigates a world where his mother’s renderings of household items are realized. The residency has been a homecoming of sorts for the artist, who obtained his M.F.A. in the city in 2010 before moving to New York, where he broke through with his virtual and live-action performances at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the 2014 Whitney Biennial.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/t-magazine/jacolby-satterwhite.html

2019-10-11,What’s on TV Friday: ‘El Camino’ and ‘Little Monsters’,"EL CAMINO: A BREAKING BAD MOVIE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Over the course of its five seasons, “Breaking Bad” transformed the character Jesse Pinkman from a dewy-eyed, small-time drug dealer into a hardened (if also penitent) desperado. The series began with Jesse (played by Aaron Paul) joining forces with Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a New Mexico high school chemistry teacher who starts cooking and distributing crystal meth to pay for cancer treatment. The last time we saw Jesse — after the drug empire the pair built together had collapsed — he was a scarred man speeding into the night behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet El Camino. This sequel, an epilogue of sorts from the series’s creator, Vince Gilligan, picks up the story from there. “It’s a chapter of ‘Breaking Bad’ that I didn’t realize that I wanted,” Paul said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “And now that I have it, I’m so happy that it’s there.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-el-camino-and-little-monsters.html

Spring is a pageant, winter a graveyard. What a shock, then, this past spring at the venerable Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show in London, to see — amid the ravishment of color and swollen blooms — an array of seed heads, pale and close to pure sculpture, without a petal in sight. It was at once austere and flagrant, a rebuttal of cherished notions of what a garden should be.

The day I arrived, I was struck by how many American accents I heard and how many selfie sticks jutted out onto the narrow sidewalks near the canals in the Nine Streets. Nothing made tourists more visible than their fervent Instagramming and ever-present iPhones. Jogging in the Vondelpark, I saw a tourist crash a bike while videoblogging. From a hotel lobby on Keizersgracht, I watched someone climb onto a locked bike near the canal, take a photo on it and then go about her afternoon. Ask a local about the tourism in Amsterdam, and you’re likely to receive an eye roll and a comment about how it’s “out of control,” as one cafe owner told me during my first week there. Last year, the city attracted almost 20 million visitors, but there are fewer than one million residents. In December, locals became so frustrated by tourist congestion that the city removed the “I amsterdam” sign near the Rijksmuseum, which reportedly generated upward of 6,000 photographs per day. Many of these photos very likely ended up on Instagram, where the hashtag #iamsterdam has been used 1.54 million times and counting.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-souvenir-photo-viewers.html

When her novel “Paradise” was banned in Texas prisons in the 1990s because of the perception that the book had been written to disrupt prison life and could potentially cause strikes or riots,  Toni Morrison had a response that the authorities likely didn’t anticipate. Morrison recalls in this documentary: “I thought, ‘How powerful is that?’” A lengthy interview with Morrison is the ballast of this movie about her, which steers away from telling a typical, straight-ahead story of Morrison’s life and instead offers a kind of meditation on the significance of her work. That is achieved through interviews with, in addition to Morrison, figures like Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Fran Lebowitz, Sonia Sanchez and Robert Gottlieb. “If you want a thorough documentation of everything Morrison has done and everyone she knows, there’s always Wikipedia,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if you’d prefer an argument for her importance and a sense of her presence, then you won’t be disappointed.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-a-toni-morrison-doc-and-fractured.html

These are some of the many accouterments of wealth seen in this latest feature from Steven Soderbergh.

At its center are Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman, who play seedy partners in a Panama City-based law firm that helps the very rich stay wealthy through many flavors of trickery. The pair’s most prominent victim here is Ellen Martin, a Midwestern widow played by Meryl Streep who catches on to the firm’s dishonesty when she tries to settle an insurance claim after her husband’s death. Also in the cast: Sharon Stone, Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts. “The film’s subject matter could hardly be more urgent,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.

Best known for his disaster-relief shelters made from recycled paper tubes, Ban is similarly rigorous about conserving time. He has no pets and no children, and his only downtime comes in the evening, when he breaks for dinner. In 1995, he built himself a weekend house near Mt. Fuji that, he tells Nikil Saval, “gets no use at all.” It’s fitting then, that when T sent Ban an instant camera and asked him to document scenes from his life, the pictures he sent back were mainly of his projects or his inspirations. His images — which show his latest project in Biel, Switzerland, and his office in Paris, where paper-tube shelving houses miniature models of his buildings — offer an intimate look at the Pritzker Prize-winning architect’s work life. But he also shares rare moments of quiet: the Stravinsky Fountain, passed on a walk through the Marais; a set of stairs; and a bottle of Jacques Selosse, opened with family on a trip to the Champagne region of northeast France.

The neighborhood is no longer predominantly Polish, but the four-floor red brick walk-up, constructed in the late 19th century, still has an old-fashioned feel and is an endless source of inspiration for McNanney, who is drawn to the timeworn and eccentric. One neighbor keeps a coop of racing pigeons — homing birds trained to fly in timed competitions (a bygone pastime of old Brooklyn) — on the roof, and when one of the building’s older tenants died about 15 years ago, it was revealed that she had painted every surface of her small apartment to resemble a traditional Polish dacha, complete with trompe l’oeil wooden shutters and a mural of dancing deer.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/t-magazine/sean-mcnanney.html

2019-10-21,"T Suggests: Animal-Shaped Jewels, a Hotel With a View and More","Cape Town, in the shadow of Table Mountain on the South African coast, has become one of the most buzzed about travel destinations in Africa in recent years. But while the city’s food and wine scenes continue to flourish, its hotel options have remained limited. The opening of Dorp, a new hotel in the historic Bo-Kaap neighborhood in the city center, known for its colorful Cape Dutch and Georgian style houses, is set to change that. Conceived by the hotelier and clothing designer Gail Behr, who opened the plush old-world Grand Hotel in the South African seaside town of Plettenberg Bay in 2004, the intimate 30-room property is more of a club than a traditional hotel. “It’s old-fashioned without being cloyingly personal and intrusive,” Behr says. Constructed from scratch with the help of the local designer Gregory Mellor, the building was devised to fit antique wooden doors, windows and slatted shutters that the team sourced from as far as India and Egypt. The interior — filled with oversize printed couches, antique cabinets, old books, wood-burning fireplaces and claw-foot bathtubs — was decorated by Behr herself. “I was determined not to take the design too seriously,” she says. “The surrounding mountains cannot be competed with!” Indeed, located on the gently sloping base of Signal Hill, Dorp has astonishing views of Table Mountain and the city’s twinkling lights. One of the best places to enjoy the vista is the hotel’s rambling garden, created by the Cape Town-based landscape designer Leon Kluge and planted with ancient mission olive trees, gnarled guava trees and purple poppies. “The garden is the prettiest place on earth, with millions of butterflies, dwarf Cape chameleons, birds and bees,” Behr says. A light-filled cafe on the ground floor serves unfussy dishes like homemade scones, grilled cheese sandwiches and slow-roasted local lamb. But perhaps Behr’s favorite space is the salon, a great homey living room brimming with couches covered in pink velvet and a playful dinosaur-printed toile by the British interiors brand House of Hackney, where she encourages guests to mingle. Already, she says, it is “filled with interesting people collaborating — and playing a poker game at the same time.” dorp.co.za — MARY HOLLAND",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/t-magazine/dorp-hotel-south-africa-sartorialist-book-style-news.html

At the hospital, he realizes he can’t remember who he is, how to walk or anything about his past — but he recognizes his identical twin brother, Marcus. This documentary follows the story of Alex’s recovery with Marcus as his guide, filling him in on the details of his childhood. But roughly a decade later, after the twins’ mother dies, Alex starts to question whether the childhood Marcus reconstructed for him was truthful, going on to uncover childhood trauma that he and his brother experienced before the accident. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that although the brothers recounted their story in a 2013 memoir, the film “functions as a continuation of the book, and ends in a staggering sequence in which Marcus is finally able to relay the whole truth to his brother.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-tell-me-who-i-am-and-patsy-loretta.html

When the 12-part comic book series “Watchmen” came out in 1986 and 1987, it upended the traditional idea of what a superhero could be. In looking back at that comic for The New York Times, Adam Sternbergh wrote that “Watchmen” “felt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world.” Now, with superhero stories dominating the box office, this new series from the “Lost” and “The Leftovers” creator Damon Lindelof offers a new take on that comic, trading the original’s Cold War themes for those of white supremacy. Regina King stars as Angela Abar, who works with the police as her masked alter ego, Sister Night, while Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart play older versions of original “Watchmen” characters Adrian Veidt and Laurie Juspeczyk.

It could be said that the primary place where Natives continue to exist for most Americans is in childhood imagination. It is no accident that Peter Pan’s tribe of Lost Boys who refuse to grow up, refuse to grow up with Indians as allies and enemies. Michael Chabon, writing in 2009, amplified the relationship among childhood, Indians, the past and the imagination. “When I was growing up,” he writes, “our house backed onto woods, a thin two-acre remnant of a once-mighty wilderness. … There were no Indians in those woods, but there had been once. We learned about them in school. Patuxent Indians, they’d been called. Swift, straight-shooting, silent as deer.

A trailer for this new Tyler Perry show promises money, power, sex, greed, lies, murder, betrayal, revenge and secrets — words that might bring to mind “The Sopranos” or maybe “Boardwalk Empire.” But the setting here is the White House, and the family at the center of the series is a fictional first family of the United States. That crew is headed by Hunter Franklin (Ed Quinn) and Victoria Franklin (Kron Moore), a fresh president and first lady whose sordid personal affairs (romantic and otherwise), infighting and disreputable dealings threaten to spill over into their public lives. (The line “See if I won’t put your head through that wall” has a different ring to it when it’s said in the Oval Office.) “The Oval” is one of a slew of new shows that a post-Madea Perry has written and directed as part of a major content deal with Viacom. Another one, TYLER PERRY’S SISTAS, about a group of women navigating modern dating, will debut on BET at 10 p.m.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-tyler-perry-shows-and-living-with-yourself.html

The sitcom, built on the friendship between its title characters, who are a lawyer and an interior designer, pushed boundaries and helped normalize gay characters in prime time TV during its original run in the late 1990s and 2000s. It was revived for a season that debuted in 2017 and aged up the characters, but left the show’s formula largely untouched: Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) were once again roommates. The 2006 original finale that saw the pair married (separately) with children was explained away as, in part, a dream that never happened. NBC has said that the latest season, the 11th, which debuts Thursday night, is going to be the show’s last. But whatever happens in the new finale may not carry the same stakes as that first one: In theory, it could all be a dream, too.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-will-grace-and-a-new-david-chang-series.html

In art as in life, abuse has been a constant; what changed in the 1970s, Princenthal says, is who depicted the experience, and how it was consequently understood.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/books/review-unspeakable-acts-nancy-princenthal.html

2019-10-24,How Mary-Kay Wilmers Became Britain’s Most Influential Editor,"On an unusually sunny, cool summer day in London, Mary-Kay Wilmers, 81, was at work in a large, light-filled loft in Bloomsbury, home to the offices of what she calls “the paper” and its readers call the L.R.B.: The London Review of Books. Petite, silver hair cut distinctively in a short bob, Wilmers had brought a copy of the latest issue — Volume 41, Number 13 — to a bright back room and a desk laden with current British newspapers and magazines. On the cover of The Sun, a photo of Taylor Swift adjoined the headline “Migrant’s 3,500-ft Plunge: Falling Jet Stowaway Lands 3ft From Sunbather.” On the cover of The Times, next to a close-up of a young woman delighting in a rainbow ice pop, ran the headline “Oxfam Staff Still Offering Aid for Sex, Report Claims.” Wilmers’s copy of the L.R.B. featured no photos of women on its cover. Instead, a painting, unblemished by text, depicting an early summer evening in London: dirty pink twilight dissolving behind a stand of trees, deep, unnatural blue overtaking the sky, two silhouetted birds coursing above overground wires. Pretty, striking and, when read with the hot pink headline incised above it — “The Sun Sets on Britain” — a different picture altogether.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/magazine/london-review-of-books-mary-kay-wilmers.html

For some, it inspires a total rejection of the artist, whose work becomes suddenly intolerable. Others reassess their taste, wondering how they were ever able to enjoy a novel with pedophilia at its center, or the stand-up routine filled with misogyny. Still others try to quarantine the art from the artist, as if one might be spared the contagion of the other.

Most of the rounds fired at our forward operating base were so poorly placed that they had to have a dash of luck to even hit a guard post. They were the untrained shots of amateurs, taken by fathers and brothers who were thrust into war by either circumstance or their ideas about the sacred duty of jihad, neither of which involved the training of a professional soldier. It was our brief age of innocence during Second Battalion, Third Marines’ deployment to Iraq in 2006. We had been largely unscathed by the true essence of war. Roadside bombs had left marks on a few of us. Concussions caused by grenades were joked about. Shrapnel left in the fleshy tissue of camouflaged buttocks were a source of hilarity. A Marine named Gabriel Odum had been shot on his first patrol, the bullet passing through his right hand and one lung, but a few lucky centimeters away from fatal. We believed we were invincible. The casualties were serious, but everyone would walk away, bearing the kinds of scars that would make them celebrities at their respective V.F.W. cantinas.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/magazine/marine-sniper-iraq.html

Eddie Murphy wears vivid suits and tilted hats and carries a weighty cane in this new biopic. The film casts Murphy as the comedian Rudy Ray Moore, who at the crest of the blaxploitation era self-financed “Dolemite,” a 1975 crime action movie in which he starred as a pimp out for revenge. The original movie became a cult hit. (A typical scene involves an F.B.I. agent being kicked into the trunk of a Cadillac.) The biopic charts the lead-up to and the making of that movie, with the help of an all-star cast: Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and Wesley Snipes play some of Moore’s associates, and Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock each make cameos. The movie has a “loose, friendly, house-party vibe,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, and is intended as a comeback vehicle for Murphy. “I didn’t want to just pop back up,” he said in a recent interview with The Times. “I wanted a funny movie to remind them that they liked me. This movie turned out so strong that I figured this is a great way to come back.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-dolemite-is-my-name-and-maleficent.html

2019-10-28,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Mrs. Fletcher’ and ‘The Witch’,"MRS. FLETCHER 10:30 p.m. on HBO. This series is based on Tom Perrotta’s novel “Mrs. Fletcher,” which was published in 2017 and tackles themes of misogyny, sexuality and female empowerment. Like the book, the limited series follows Eve Fletcher, a divorced mom (Kathryn Hahn) in her mid-40s, and her son Brendan (Jackson White), an entitled jock starting his freshman year at college, as they embark on respective journeys of sexual enlightenment. While Brendan struggles to connect with his political-minded peers and confronts conversations about consent, Eve indulges in her newfound freedom by going down an internet pornography rabbit hole. “‘Mrs. Fletcher’ is a very right-now show,” Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The New York Times. “It’s one of many short-run half-hour dramedies about a woman entering a new phase of her life who discovers new vectors of sexuality and self-actualization while also being treated shabbily.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-mrs-fletcher-and-the-witch.html

David Simon’s breakout show “The Wire” articulated how the lives of ordinary people are shaped by the institutions they find themselves caught up in. “The Deuce,” which Simon created with George Pelecanos, has a similar theme. For three seasons the series has shown how changes in the pornography industry in the United States affected the people involved in it. The show’s final season, which concludes Monday, jumped  to the mid-1980s, when VHS technology made it possible for people to watch erotic films easily at home. Some of the show’s characters, like Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who went from prostitute to pornographic film director, seem to have prospered amid these changes, while others, like Frankie (James Franco),  have clearly suffered. But for the most part the message is clear: Everyone is trying to get by in a world controlled by forces stronger than any individual.

2019-10-29,What’s on TV Tuesday: Rob Zombie’s ‘Halloween’ and ‘Haxan’,"HALLOWEEN (2007) 9 p.m. on AMC. In his New York Times review of John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher film “Halloween,” Jason Zinoman wrote that Michael Myers isn’t like other movie monsters: “He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life.” But this take on that film, directed by the heavy metal singer Rob Zombie, upends that idea by exploring Myers’s back story and unmasking his motive to kill. It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. He’s then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, who’s now a teenager. In his review for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that “the case study part of the film re-establishes Mr. Zombie’s status as modern American horror’s most eccentric and surprising filmmaker.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-rob-zombie-halloween-and-haxan.html

Several decades ago I had an affair with a woman I met in a writing class at a prestigious university’s continuing-education program. I was at a very fragile and vulnerable point in my life. My husband and I and our young children had recently moved to a new town where I knew no one. My children were both in school — I’d quit my job to raise a family — and I was lost, insecure, unhappy in my marriage and deeply depressed. (I was later put on antidepressants, which I continue to take to this day.) Not only did this woman think I was special and build my ego up as no one had ever done, but she also thought my writing was amazing. She had impressive credentials (she was published; she was enrolled as a graduate student in another program at the university and so on) so her support and encouragement made me feel as though I could accomplish anything.

And then it faded — overshadowed by the onslaught of American and European Neo-Expressionist painting. But P&D, as it was called, a reaction to the austerities of Minimalism and the limits of high art, never really went away. Most of the artists kept working, and the questions they raised about decoration, craft, function and (even) beauty — and the frequently pejorative connotations of those words — hung around. These issues also mutated in the work of artists as various as Jean Lowe (who is married to Mr. MacConnel), Philip Taaffe, Rudolf Stingel and Laurel Sparks.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/arts/design/art-galleries-new-york-city.html

Prepare to spend time and money. By the 1970s, the fort was mostly ruined and the moat dry, when the local government began excavating the canals and rebuilding; the project took 25 years and went way over budget. “The canals must be deep and wide,” Meendering says: Try eight feet deep and 20 to 40 feet wide. Consider geology and its potential effects on sedimentation. Plan a route across; Bourtange has five wooden drawbridges, but they’re too heavy and dangerous to pull up. Don’t expect your moat to stop swimmers not wearing armor. “A person can easily swim across within a minute if they want,” Meendering says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/magazine/how-to-build-a-moat.html

2019-11-01,One Photographer’s Exploration of the Paranormal,"On a blustery October evening inside a chapel at Green-Wood Cemetery in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the photographer Shannon Taggart guided an audience through a series of images: a circle of hands placed atop a dimly lit table; a woman holding what appeared to be a transistor radio, listening with eyes closed; orbs flashing across a starry night sky. The photographs were from her new book, “Séance,” the result of her 18-year exploration of Spiritualism, the religious movement based on a belief in the possibility of communication between the living and the dead that emerged from New York in the 1840s. The project, which she calls “part documentary and part ghost story,” comprises her own images of Lily Dale — the world’s largest Spiritualist community, founded in the mid-19th century on the shore of Cassadaga Lake in New York — along with historical photographs, narratives about her subjects and illustrated essays by the artists Tony Oursler and Andreas Fischer about the movement’s influence on art and culture.
