2023-01-02,"In the ‘Cozy Catastrophe’ Novel, the End of the World Is Not So Bad","In “Billion Year Spree,” his influential 1973 study of science fiction, the writer Brian Aldiss identified a kind of post-apocalyptic novel that he called “the cozy catastrophe.” These were stories about the end of the world in which a resourceful survivor — usually a British man from the middle class — puts together a relatively comfortable life for himself in the ruins. Although the genre is often associated with the work of John Wyndham, especially “The Day of the Triffids” (1951), Aldiss traced it back to THE HOPKINS MANUSCRIPT (Scribner, 385 pp., paperback, $18), by R.C. Sherriff, which first appeared in 1939. Reissued this month, this wonderful novel should powerfully resonate with readers whose consciences are troubled by inequality and climate change. As Aldiss wrote, “The essence of cozy catastrophe is that the hero should have a pretty good time … while everyone else is dying off.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/books/review/r-c-sherriff-the-hopkins-manuscript.html

Originally based in Arcata, in Northern California, 10 years ago he moved his operation and established his own hives further south, in Point Reyes Station, Calif., near San Francisco. His varietal sparkling meads use honeys close to home and farther afield (Marin County Wildflower and Hawaiian Lehua Blossom, for example), each resulting in distinct aromas and flavors, just the way Champagnes are distinguished by terroir and cuvée. Now, to encourage small beekeepers worldwide, he and Michael Zilber, his managing director, have introduced the World Honey Initiative Collection, three new international sparkling meads in partnership with the World Honey Exchange, an organization that helps honey cooperatives. The Ethiopian Geteme Blossom sparkling mead is pale and floral, slightly bitter, with a honeyed aftertaste. Chilean Ulmo Blosson is a deeper gold, with hints of spice and mellow richness. Tanzanian Miombo Wildflower is amber, full-bodied with an alluring smokiness, making it a fine partner for cheese.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/dining/sparkling-mead-heidrun.html
2023-01-03,"White Olive, With a Focus on Greek and Turkish Food, Opens in Midtown","The brothers Michael Karim Sopariwalla and Amin Himani, busy restaurateurs in Staten Island and beyond, have joined forces for the first time to open this Mediterranean restaurant, offering tastes of Greece and Turkey in Midtown Manhattan. The two came up with the idea while traveling in the region. The result is a fairly compact dining room, mostly with high-top tables and creamy leather upholstered chairs that share the space with the bar. (More tables are set in an L-shaped extension for a total of 80 seats.) Walls are sheathed in pale wood and light, deeply textured Turkish volcanic stone; woven Turkish runners are placed over the tablecloths. The chef, Hasan Karci from Turkey, worked at Ritz-Carltons in Istanbul and Palm Beach. The Greek repertoire is represented by tzatziki, keftedes (meatballs), baked shrimp saganaki, lemon potatoes and lavraki (branzino).

One day, it stayed into the evening, so we kept it overnight. We were worried about foxes. The next day, the cat appeared wearing a tracking collar, and its owner soon followed. He told us he had another cat and a dog, but he didn’t leave any contact information. Now it’s winter — and extremely cold — and the cat comes every day (without its tracker). We shoo it away at night, but it clearly wants to stay here, napping under the radiator. What should we do? We love the cat, but we don’t want to steal someone else’s expensive pet.

The writer bangs ardently at the keyboard when the muse strikes and stares moodily into a landscape when she fails to show.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/opinion/robert-caro-robert-gottlieb-and-the-art-of-the-edit.html

2023-01-05,"In the Mountains of Lebanon, a Centuries-Old Guesthouse Welcomes New Visitors","The morning is very simple: I shower and wash my face with the Deep Cleanse exfoliating cleanser from Tatcha and, once a week, I’ll use this Sisley-Paris Exfoliating Enzyme Mask. That has been great for the discoloration on my skin. On my body I’ll use the Grown Alchemist Intensive Body Exfoliant followed by the Tatcha Hinoki Body Milk while my skin is still wet. Unlike a lot of creams that just sit on the skin, this really hydrates and sinks in. I wear the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair serum during the day, because I have eczema and it’s really protective, and EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46. I just got back from Japan and discovered this really great gender-neutral complexion line called Iroiku. It helps neutralize the undertones of the skin and gives you this really beautiful, balanced complexion, so I’ve been wearing that when I’m on camera. And I have a few things I always carry: Honest Beauty Magic Beauty Balm, I use it as a highlighter, elbow cream, everything. On my lips I use the Sisley-Paris Nutritive Lip Balm, which is heavier for winter. Lastly, no one seems to understand Tatcha’s Serum Stick — you can slather it all over your skin or on top of makeup if it’s starting to dry out, but I use it any time I’m feeling a bit dry or am getting flaky skin around my nose. A few times a week I’ll use 111Skin Celestial Black Diamond mask or Jaxon Lane’s Bro Mask, which has a lot of caffeine and niacinamide in it. I tried the Theraface Pro after giving one to a client who loved it, and I’ve noticed it really de-puffs and the LED lights help with breakouts. I also see Joanna Vargas for Triple Crown facials. The first time I saw her it changed my skin. I’ve been bald for so long and I’m very particular about my head-shaving ritual. I always use this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Shave Gel, but the trick is that you need to exfoliate the skin before and after. I’ve been using Tatcha’s Texture Tonic as an after-shave and I don’t get any bumps or razor burn — and it doesn’t sting. I even tell my clients to use it on legs or underarms where they might get bumps. The first fragrance I bought in college at the Nordstrom in Seattle was L’Eau d’Issey and it’s still the one I go back to.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/t-magazine/lebanon-travel-hotel-indira.html

France was divided over whether he was guilty or innocent, one side being largely monarchist and Catholic, the other liberal and Republican (in the French sense). The dramatic climax came when France’s great novelist Émile Zola — 125 years ago, on Jan. 13, 1898 — published an article headlined “J’Accuse,” in the form of an open letter to the president, claiming that not only was Alfred Dreyfus innocent but the reason he had been found guilty was that he was a Jew and there had been a high-level conspiracy to frame him. Zola was accused of libel, but rather than let him face probable imprisonment his friends put him on a train to England, where he sat glumly eating boiled potatoes while lamenting the hostility he had faced personally and the state of France’s democracy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/books/review/dreyfus-affair-the-prisoner-and-the-writer-heather-camlot-sophie-casson.html

Borders, he writes, are “wellsprings of memory.” A border can be “a story of identity” or a “place at once to be feared and honored.” Sometimes Crawford depicts a border in terms that are both geographical and moral, as “a wound … in the landscape.” Often, borders exist in the realm of metaphor, demarcating “the journey from boy to man,” “the margin … between sanity and madness,” “the very shape of contempt.” In any case, a border “is never simply a line, a marker, a wall, an edge. First, it is an idea.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/books/review/the-edge-of-the-plain-james-crawford.html

With the Fed, the nation’s central bank, rapidly raising interest rates to combat the highest inflation that the United States had experienced in four decades, Wall Street was especially skittish. But there was little chance of Kashkari’s committing a gaffe: He was a skilled public speaker, an ability that he honed during a failed campaign for governor in California in 2014. He also had a politician’s knack for using easy-to-understand anecdotes to illustrate complicated ideas. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/magazine/inflation-federal-reserve.html

It finally happened on Dec. 31. “I think it turned out for the best,” said the chief executive Shelley Armistead. She was taking a brief break from waiting tables in the restaurant’s upstairs dining room; she pitches in from time to time. The restaurant serves only breakfast and lunch, no reservations. Ms. Armistead cited the pandemic, construction and permits for the delays; dinner was not planned right out of the gate, and will not be served until more staff is trained. “But when you serve breakfast, you attract the neighborhood, not Instagram followers,” she said. The two-story, 120-seat space has a cafe area in front and a bright, rustic bare-table dining room with an open kitchen, bar and counter beyond. Upstairs, you’ll find two polished dining rooms and a bar with plush mohair banquettes and a sunny front area. In Los Angeles, the Gjelina Group has a bakery, a takeout shop and other retail venues, some of which Ms. Armistead is hoping to transport to New York. Ms. Armistead described the Gjelina Group as a “collective of 550 people,” taking the approach that they give as much financial support as possible directly to suppliers, like farmers, anglers, weavers, ceramists and flower cultivators. A collaborative menu helmed by Juan Hernandez consists of largely produce-driven specialties like lemon buckwheat ricotta pancakes, a frittata with leeks and herbs, and Moroccan baked eggs with merguez for breakfast; oysters, lamb tartare, smoked mackerel with arugula, roasted arrowhead cabbage in bagna cauda, einkorn pappardelle with brisket, duck confit with red cabbage, and 10 inventive pizzas, including one with mixed mushrooms and garlic confit.

She clicked on the link to her Facebook page and began her post: “I’ve been struggling mightily for the past few weeks with sciatica, which is excruciating leg pain caused by a pinched or irritated nerve.” It hurt to stand; it hurt even more to sit — the weight of her body was torture on her thighs. The only times she was mostly pain free were when she was lying down and when she was walking. She was a journalist, and for the past several weeks she had to do all her reporting and writing from her couch. She’d seen her doctor, who gave her a muscle relaxer, and her chiropractor, who adjusted her back. Neither provided any relief.

But for years, Big Tech’s business model has created barriers to consumers who want to repair those broken devices, incentivizing them to just buy new ones instead. Since 2003, Kyle Wiens has been fighting against that eternal treadmill as the founder and C.E.O. of iFixit, a site that allows people to write and share user manuals for gadgets, toys, appliances and more. Kyle’s work has made him a leader of the Right to Repair movement — a political cause that’s recently seen its first victory in New York State with the passage of a new bill, the Digital Fair Repair Act. It will require companies to make repairing electronics easier for consumers and independent repair shops, without needing to rely on manufacturers.

2023-01-12,A Japanese Retreat That Brings New Meaning to Forest Bathing,"Experimental and theatrical are among the words commonly used to describe the chef Paul Pairet’s culinary vision at Ultraviolet, his triple Michelin-star restaurant in Shanghai. But for his first project in France since the early 2000s, which opens Jan. 25 at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, the ambitions are more modest: perfectly executed, unpretentious French classics. Replacing the hotel’s former Brasserie d’Aumont and men’s grooming space, Nonos by Paul Pairet, with its moody interior by Tristan Auer, is the chef’s take on a modern French steakhouse (the name means little bone in children’s French). “I wanted to revive a retro-chic format of steakhouse dining from the ’60s and ’70s where the grill was front and center, servers came to the table with trolleys to slice meat and cheese, and dishes had broad appeal but were enhanced with the best products available,” explains the Perpignan-born Pairet. The menu is focused on familiar favorites ranging from onion soup and cheese soufflés to traditional dishes like seafood vol-au-vent. Comestibles, the deli area, will serve up snacks such as deviled eggs, pâté en croûte and Gascon cured ham. “Traditional French food is back in a big way across Paris,” Pairet says. “To do it right in an iconic setting like this — it’s a chef’s dream.” rosewoodhotels.com",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/t-magazine/hokkaido-japan-travel-hotel.html

She struggled to define her own identity even as she embraced her birthright (and various equally headline-grabbing men, including Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage), landing on the cover of Vogue in 1996 with a story entitled “Daddy’s Girl.” Inside, Steven Meisel captured her trying on different selves, literally, to see how they might fit — including one shot of her grinning in a khaki Prada camp shirt and tie, cropped black hair in a rockabilly bouffant, channeling her father during his army days when he was still a fresh-faced twentysomething riding the crest of his talent.

2023-01-16,The Week in Business: More Air Travel Chaos,"On the heels of Southwest Airlines’ holiday travel meltdown, a much wider systemic breakdown grounded planes last week. The source of the problem lay with the Federal Aviation Administration, whose system alerting pilots to safety issues went down on Wednesday. In total, the disruption caused more than 9,000 delays and 1,300 cancellations, leaving many passengers stranded with no airline to blame. The cause was a damaged database file, according to the agency, and the White House said there was no evidence of a cyberattack. But the system failure is nonetheless unsettling, revealing the fragility of the infrastructure that the country relies on to manage commercial air traffic. Critics say the F.A.A. has struggled to keep up with technological advances as well as the rise in the number of flights and passengers. The air travel chaos again put Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the agency, in the hot seat.

2023-01-17,"A Naples Institution, L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele, Opens in the West Village","Growing up in Naples, Italy, Francesco Zimone‌ often had pizza with his father at L’‌Antica Pizzeria da Michele, founded in 1870‌. Four years ago, ‌following a career in finance and residential renovation, he obtained the rights to open a branch ‌in Hollywood, Calif., and‌ another in Santa Barbara. ‌Now, he’s opening one in New York. ‌With a big, glassed-in open kitchen in ‌a spacious rear dining room, the place is more restaurant than pizzeria. “A pizzeria doesn’t have to be a joint,” Mr. Zimone said. His is clearly not. It has a barroom in front, with a separate counter for salumi and cheeses, and a brick-walled main dining room beyond. Tables are roomy to accommodate the 16-inch‌ ‌Neapolitan-style pies with their typically flavorful thin crusts‌ and puffy, char-tattooed edge‌. Here, they’re also made with imported Italian ingredients like flour, San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella. (Mr. Zimone’s partner and head pizzaolo, Michele Rubini, is a fifth-generation member of the original pizzeria family.) In addition to pizza, there are antipasti, including gnocco fritto and montanarine made with fried pizza dough; salads; sandwiches (with a burger to come); a few pastas; and main courses. He said everything is made in house. In a few weeks, he plans to open a more-intimate Taverna downstairs for dining and private parties. After looking at many possible locations, he selected this one in the West Village, even though it required extensive renovation. “The streets reminded me of parts of Napoli and Trastevere,” he said. “It felt like home.”",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

In a society rife with corruption, where bribes routinely ensure advancement in both the public and private sectors, attending an elite college is one of the most reliable merit-based routes to success.

2023-01-19,"In Philadelphia, a Cocktail Bar With Bold Colors and Swedish Meatballs","When the hospitality company Dovetail + Co. first envisioned a Hawaii outpost for Wayfinder, the boutique hotel brand whose original Rhode Island location is beloved for its Newport-specific charm, the group’s owner, Phil Hospod, knew he wanted to design a place that drew from “the B-side” of Waikiki, a reference to the lesser-known songs often found on a record’s flip side. The Wayfinder Waikiki is accordingly situated not on the oceanfront but on the (relatively) quiet Ala Wai Boulevard, with sweeping views of Diamond Head and the Koʻolau mountain range. (Still, it’s just a short three-block walk to the white sands and surf breaks.) The hotel’s rough-hewn ’60s Brutalist structure — a rarity among the neighborhood’s muted high-rises and tiki kitsch — now features eclectic, tropical interiors courtesy of the local design studio the Vanguard Theory. Drawing inspiration from the islands’ rich heritage, custom furnishings and textiles blend multicultural motifs for the 228 rooms. (Think: checkered palaka prints on pillows with aloha shirt designs and Japanese obi belt-inspired patterns decorating headboards.) A three-story Spanish terra-cotta building, housing rooms with kitchenettes, overlooks a 70-foot saltwater lagoon pool. Determined to give visitors a more insider experience of the island, Hospod and his team have partnered with a number of local businesses and organizations such as the record label Aloha Got Soul, which supplies the lobby with rare Hawaii vinyl reissues. The Bishop Museum, a century-old institution dedicated to Hawaii’s culture, is involved in creating a volunteer program for guests. In April, the hotel plans to open two on-site dining venues that will join its B-Side coffee bar: the first Waikiki location of Redfish (the popular Honolulu spot known for its inventive poke bowls) and the poolside bar Lost + Found, which will focus on local microbrews and tropical cocktails.

Eventually, after a wrong turn, they came upon a field, a few miles south of Tangier’s Moorish medinas, teeming with wild irises.

Located behind the original Roberta’s in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Blanca has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic, but there are plans for its reopening.

Marble, stone, Murano glass elements and a colorful palette are hallmarks of Mr. Hoy’s design for a setting worthy of some of Mr. Mirarchi’s high-end ingredients. The menu is brief, featuring no more than five each of starters, pastas and main courses. Currently there’s no pizza, but a wood-fired oven is used. Sam Pollheimer, who was at Roberta’s in Los Angeles, is the chef de cuisine in charge, working with Mr. Mirarchi.
