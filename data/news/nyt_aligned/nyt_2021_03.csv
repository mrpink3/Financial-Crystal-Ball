They documented the resurgence of cider mills across the country, a 100-fold increase since 1991. Their thumbnail history of cider traces it from the Old World, around the time of Christ. This serious but easygoing book points out that ciders tend to be a local quaff unlike wine, which always had an international market. The authors discuss the many different apples (in the 19th century there were 1,000 varieties growing in the United States), which ones are suited for cider, how cider is made and even the geology of the land, as they survey ciders in eight regions across the country.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/dining/american-cider-book.html

2021-03-02,Venison All the Way From Hawaii,"Areas across the country, even some suburbs, have to deal with growing herds of often unwelcome deer. Count Maui, in Hawaii, among them. Axis deer, an Asian breed, were introduced for hunting in the mid-1900s, and they still attract the sharp-shooting crowd. But as their numbers have grown to the tens of thousands, the deer are also considered to be an invasive menace, not just on the roads, but for the way they denude the landscape of vegetation, causing erosion and water runoffs that can damage coral reefs. Maui Nui, a new company, is now turning them into dinner. Across the island, it harvests wild deer at night so the animals are supposedly less stressed and uses a mobile slaughtering facility. Now various cuts of venison, frozen, in preset combinations that include succulent racks, medallions, strip loins, stew meat for a nice braise and ground venison can be shipped to customers across the United States. The meat is mild-tasting, slightly beefy and tender. It’s also very lean, so add some slab bacon to your stew and plenty of olive oil to the ragù. A four-chop rack serving two will take about 20 minutes at 425 degrees for medium-rare. The company’s bone broth is delicious.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/dining/maui-nui-venison.html

Now, with the restaurant project postponed, they have opened an inviting retail shop named Twiggy — after Mr. Mikolasko’s mother’s nickname — in the front of that space. The store has a bright display of quiches, thick rustic pizzas, bright green beans, roasted endives, crisp chiplike potatoes, several iterations of chicken (including fried), meat loaf and some salads, all offered on a rotating basis.

Ingredients are premeasured — often including items that are hard to find — and some of the instructions and labeling could be more precise. Ramp up the price point and you have another set of options from Taste, offering complete meal boxes from restaurants with Michelin stars on a weekly rotating basis.

As paper became more common in the 7th century, though, the art of paper cutting, or jianzhi, flourished. “While calligraphy reflects the intellectual culture, paternal tradition and written history,” wrote Crystal Hui-Shu Yang, a scholar of Chinese folk art, in a 2007 essay on the cross-cultural exchange between jianzhi artisans and Swiss practitioners of scherenschnitte, the form’s central European iteration, which emerged in the 16th century, “paper cutting represents illiterate culture, maternal tradition and oral history.” From the beginning, then, there has been an appealingly intimate, democratic quality to the craft.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/t-magazine/paper-houses-craft-architecture-design.html

Indeed, the pieces were among the most sought-after designs, along with delicate floral-patterned bone-china tea sets and intricate neo-Classical jasperware vases produced by the Potteries, the group of pioneering factories, eventually numbering in the hundreds, established in the 17th century in the coal-mining towns that form the present-day city of Stoke-on-Trent.

Their son, Evan, now 39, began collecting unique precious stones in his 20s. Already working for the family firm by then (he’d designed his first piece for the brand, a pair of cuff links, at age 11), Evan was obsessed with his rare gems — a 50-carat Kazakhstani spinel and a giant museum-quality opal from Lightning Ridge, Australia, among them. “My parents thought I was insane, paying that much for single stones,” he says. He never made them into jewelry, but a few years ago, when the family moved into high jewelry to complement its more accessible designs, Evan, now the chief creative officer, realized it was at last time to part with some of his treasures. So far, he has designed nearly 20 pieces using his private stash, including this white-gold diamond chain necklace with a 31-carat Colombian emerald pendant. He had the gem reconfigured into an antique cushion cut, which contrasts with the modern setting. “It’s vulnerable for me to let these stones go because they’re so personal,” he says. “When they’re gone, they’re gone.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/t-magazine/david-yurman-emerald-necklace-jewelry.html

2021-03-18,The Rome Apartment a Hotelier Calls Home,"LIKE THE WILD Tuscan orchids that burst forth in shades of lemon and violet along the craggy coast of Italy’s Argentario promontory, Marie-Louise Sciò’s life comes into full bloom in spring. It’s then that she prepares for the busy summer season at her family’s three hotels, the Mezzatorre on the island of Ischia, La Posta Vecchia in Ladispoli and Il Pellicano, the legendary resort cradled in the volcanic rocks above the seaside town of Porto Ercole. Since 2011, Sciò has been not only the embodiment of these properties’ glamorously Italian spirit but their creative director and C.E.O. Her father, Robert Sciò, bought Hotel Il Pellicano in 1979 from Patricia Graham, an American heiress, and her British husband, Michael, an ex-R.A.F. fighter pilot, who had built it in the mid-60s as a private villa and club. Its languid, sun-bleached charm was immortalized by the photographer Slim Aarons. These days, it is the 44-year-old Sciò who oversees its 47 rooms and two terrace restaurants. With an offhand manner that belies a great deal of preparation, she seamlessly coordinates each aspect of Il Pellicano. “It’s all-consuming,” she says, “but in an amazing way.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/t-magazine/marie-louise-scio-design-rome.html

We needed something new.” They found it a little more than an hour away in Nykoping, a harbor city on the pristine southeastern Baltic coast with settlements that date back to the Bronze Age. Here, in a quiet corner of town, surrounded on three sides by communal gardens inhabited by deer and the occasional white owl, and bordered to the east by a forest of Swedish oak and silver birch, was the place that would inspire — and lend its name to — the home textiles and furniture company that the pair went on to establish in 2016.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/t-magazine/magniberg-design-apartment.html

Her disparagement is catnip to those many critics who like to view “Mrs. Dalloway” — that other uber-famous, if more lapidary, modernist novel that spans the course of a single day — as Woolf’s rejoinder to Joyce. More than that, though, it tells us something important about our literary history. Nineteen twenty-two, the year of “Ulysses,” may well be ground zero for the explosion of modernism in literature. But the resultant shock wave is better captured by another year: 1925, that of “Mrs. Dalloway” and several other works, all now in the spotlight in 2021, as they emerge from under copyright.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/books/review/woolf-dos-passos-hemingway-fitzgerald-1925-manhattan-transfer-great-gatsby-mrs-dalloway.html

2021-03-22,A Psychedelic Reinterpretation of Medieval Wall Tapestries,"Wall tapestries were commissioned by the Catholic Church in the 13th and 14th centuries to communicate Bible stories to the illiterate masses, but by the Renaissance, they had become aristocratic status symbols. When kings and nobles were defeated in battle, the victor often seized the huge, intricately woven textiles, with their scenes of conflict, village life and mythical beasts, and resized them to fit the walls of their own castles, where they served as both insulation and trophies. Now, Maharam, the textile maker that began at the turn of the 20th century as a fabric pushcart on the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, has reinterpreted the traditional craft. The company collaborated with the New York-based design firm 2x4, which took hundreds of public-domain images of tapestries from the 14th to the 16th centuries to create a 10-by-20-foot digital collage titled Tableau Vivant. Maharam then digitally printed the panorama onto a cellulose and latex substrate that can be applied directly to a wall (smaller sections can be customized to fit any space). From a distance, the work appears to be a museum piece, but up close — where you can see peasants pasted next to unicorns and trees growing at strange angles — it collapses time and space with a psychedelic verve.

2021-03-23,An Elusive Artist’s Trove of Never-Before-Seen Images,"RAY JOHNSON ARRIVED in New York City in 1949, still in his early 20s, and lived there for a two-decade span in which the dominant artists in town — abstract painters like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still — came to be regarded, especially by themselves, as seers. Johnson, however, was a prankster. Like the bunny head he adopted as his trademark — a cartoonish line drawing that appeared in much of his work, often bearing the name of a key figure in 20th-century art — he hopped lightly, merrily across this playing field. Reveling in puns and irreverence (an untitled 1973 collage known as “Jackson Pollock Fillets” includes cut-out recipes for Pollock Fillets Amandine and Barbecued Pollock Burgers), conducting his life as a nonstop performance, he revived the Dada tradition embodied by his hero Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to the grandiosity of Minimal art, land art, Pop Art and other macho midcentury movements, he offered something much humbler: collages or drawings of portable size and wry wit. As a response to Happenings, a term coined by Allan Kaprow to describe the participatory performances that flourished in New York in the early ’60s, Johnson staged Nothings, in which a befuddled audience was sometimes greeted with an empty room. He decamped to Long Island in 1968 — residing eventually in a sanctuary in Locust Valley he called the Pink House, though it wasn’t pink — and over the years his ties to his New York friends weakened.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/t-magazine/ray-johnson-photographs.html

She’s serving as creative adviser. Her friend Maneesh K. Goyal, an entrepreneur whose father owned a restaurant but who is new to the business, is doing the heavy lifting. He has brought on David Rabin, a partner in the Lambs Club, and the chef Hari Nayak, who has worked in kitchens in Bangalore, India; Bangkok; Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and elsewhere, after graduating from the Culinary Institute of America. Melissa Bowers designed Sona to evoke the Art Deco period that flourished in Mumbai in the 1930s. Mirrors from that era share the space with earlier design statements like Thonet-style chairs and Josef Hoffmann sconces. Stately gilded columns brighten the front lounge and the rear main dining room in a space that’s elegant down to the tablecloths. Mr. Nayak’s menu, not the typical Indian culinary encyclopedia, covers the subcontinent and beyond with dishes like tandoor roasted beets, Malvani prawn curry, Malabar chicken biryani, and coal-roasted oysters spiked with chile, garlic and lime. There’s a black-spiced roast chicken feast for two, and a Goan fish curry in a tribute to the late Floyd Cardoz, who was a friend to both Mr. Nayak and Mr. Goyal. He also gives a nod to Mr. Goyal’s family’s Texas restaurant, India House, with their butter chicken. (Opens Friday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Takei Moore, who was born in Yokohama and grew up in Tokyo, remembers the communal-style donabe at the center of her family’s dining table year round, and how it drew everyone toward it for the simmering dish known as a nabe, or hot pot. “The most common style when I was growing up was yosenabe, which means anything goes,” she said. Some nights, that meant a pot of fish and vegetables in a miso broth, or a clean-out-the-fridge pot of scraps simmered in dashi. Some nights it was tiny handmade meatballs seasoned with white miso and ginger, or big wobbly cuts of soft tofu with whatever vegetables looked good. “I loved it, but didn’t think it was anything special,” she said.

Sitting before an array of glowing LED screens and pop-culture paraphernalia (a star from the Super Mario games, Thor’s hammer from the Marvel movies), Paffrath, a wiry white man in his late 20s with a close-cropped beard, leaned into the lights and greeted his viewers.

2021-03-25,American Sign Language Finds Its Spotlight,"LAST AUGUST, several months into lockdown, Raven Sutton posted a short clip on TikTok. In it, Sutton, a 25-year-old Black Deaf dancer living in Washington D.C., covers Cardi B’s song “WAP” in American Sign Language, or A.S.L., which she’s used, alongside English, her entire life. Wearing a tan crop top and hoop earrings, Sutton signs Megan Thee Stallion’s verse, maintaining coy eye contact with her camera as she reimagines lines like “Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me” for a Deaf audience. Sutton, of course, can’t “hear” the music in a conventional sense. But having danced since childhood, she’s found ways to channel her intuitive feel for rhythm through the vast, lexically complex language of sign, paying close attention to the vibrations of the bass pounding through her speakers or holding an eight-count so she knows when the words begin. Sutton posted the 35-second video and then closed the app for a few hours to get on with her day. She returned to thousands of likes, comments and, eventually, a retweet from Cardi B herself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/t-magazine/american-sign-language-asl-deaf-culture.html

Eagles come together to mate and nest, but most of the time they are solitary and self-sufficient. Unlike humans, eagles aren’t social animals attuned to hierarchies, or to the push and pull of cooperative living. “They have no desire to please you,” McGough says. You are evolutionarily primed to need love and acceptance. An eagle longs for very different things: She needs to soar thousands of feet above the ground on a rising column of warm air, and when she comes down she wants to rip open the bloody innards of a jack rabbit with her talons.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/magazine/how-to-befriend-an-eagle.html
