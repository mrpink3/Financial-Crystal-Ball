The agency, which assists 80 million people in 80 countries, has been vexed by recurring financial travails as humanitarian crises have expanded in the Middle East and Africa.

Then a pompous theater actor (Edward Norton) comes along and threatens to steal the show. Riggan’s fresh-from-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) has taken on the role of his assistant. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this best-picture winner “a funny, frenetic, buoyant and rambunctiously showboating entertainment” in which the director Alejandro G. Iñárritu “himself rises high and then higher still.” Riggan, Mr. Scott added, “isn’t the only man on the move: So is Mr. Iñárritu, who has staged and shot the movie so that it looks like everything that happens, from airborne beginning to end, occurs during one transporting continuous take. The camera doesn’t just move with the story and characters, it also ebbs and flows like water, soars and swoops like a bird, its movement as fluid as a natural element, as animated as a living organism.” Mr. Iñárritu won the Oscar for best director, and Emmanuel Lubezki for cinematography.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Maria Callas had defined the role for late 20th-century audiences as a supreme test for a fiercely intense, formidable soprano. Some powerhouse mezzo-sopranos, like Shirley Verrett and Grace Bumbry, had made the leap. But a perky Cinderella singing Norma?

Simmons, in an Oscar-winning portrayal), a charismatic and terrifying instructor whose teaching methods include browbeating, humiliation and cymbal throwing in this second feature from Damien Chazelle. And a blood bath, literal and figurative, ensues. “For all its dexterity and assurance, the movie has its share of false notes and rhythmic stumbles,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “A few plot twists test the limits of credibility. And there is something a little dispiriting — if sadly unsurprising — about the way Mr. Chazelle turns a historically African-American art form into the existential arena for a couple of white guys.” Still, he added, “the battle of master and disciple is exciting and terrifying to witness, and, at its best, the film can feel as wild and spontaneous, as risky and precise, as a live jam session.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

But if you go too fast, you work up a sweat and then catch a chill inside the church.” Meursault’s response conveys his overwhelming, and baffling, sense of imprisonment: “She was right. There was no way out.” It’s an illustrative moment of the paralysis — damned if I do, damned if I don’t — that characterizes so much of existential literature: Vladimir and Estragon, waiting for a God who never shows; the man from the country in the parable told by the priest in Kafka’s “The Trial,” inert, cursing his fate and praying to fleas, waiting for the doorkeeper to admit him into the Law; Gregor Samsa, trapped between identities, unable to leave his house or return to his human condition. This existential paralysis emerges, in part, from spiritual crisis: If God is dead, what is the individual’s role in an essentially meaningless universe? Are we pawns in the thrall of bureaucratic (Kafka) or totalitarian (Orwell) systems? Or are we, in fact, the ones with ultimate power; the arbiters — even unknowingly — of life and death?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/books/review/the-beautiful-bureaucrat-by-helen-phillips.html

The aid agencies, including the W.H.O., need $60.9 million to operate their health care centers in Iraq but have received only $5.1 million from donors. More than 184 centers serving refugees and other people displaced by violence in Iraq have suspended their operations, the W.H.O. said. The centers were the only health care providers in many parts of Iraq. “This is a country ravaged by conflict,” said Dr. Syed Jaffar Hussain, the W.H.O. representative in Iraq. “Not only do we have innocent civilians being caught in the violence, with so many people fleeing the fighting and living in temporary housing, people are at much higher risk from communicable diseases. Unless additional funding is received, millions more will be deprived of health services they urgently need.” The W.H.O. said it was appealing to international donors and seeking alternative sources of funding.

She recently held a stoop sale, and I recognized a very large number of the items that were formerly ours on display for sale. Am I wrong to see this as somehow inappropriate? I recognize that a gift means I’m not free to question what the receiver does with it, but this has changed the way I feel about her and the prospect of putting out other items in the future.

2015-08-06,What’s on TV Thursday,"6:25 P.M. (Flix) FLIRTING WITH DISASTER (1996) Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller), a worker at the American Museum of Natural History and a new father, goes in search of his biological parents with the help of Tina (Téa Leoni), an adoption agency employee, and encounters a succession of oddballs in this comedy from David O. Russell. Patricia Arquette (above right, with, from left, Josh Brolin, Ms. Leoni, Mr. Stiller and Richard Jenkins) plays Mel’s wife, who is just getting her sexual footing back after the birth of their son and doesn’t like Tina’s flirty ways. Mary Tyler Moore plays the mother who raised Mel. She nags a lot and likes to show off her body. “I want you to consider my age and ask yourself how I maintain this,” she declares, lifting her sweater. Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin called the film a “wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie,” adding that “thanks to this filmmaker’s fine comic acumen, the payoff is always there.” In “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” (2013), at 8 on Cinemax, Mr. Stiller, who also directed this adaptation of the James Thurber short story, stars as Walter, a dutiful drone in the photography department of Life magazine, who finds himself in a caper beyond his wildest imagination when the negative for the publication’s final print edition goes missing. Kristen Wiig plays the crinkly-nosed co-worker on whom Walter has a crush; Adam Scott is the leader of the new tech-jerk bosses who have Walter’s job on the line; and Sean Penn is the mysterious photographer behind Walter’s travels to Iceland, Afghanistan and other stunning far-off places. “Though it is a celebration of modesty, there is also quite a lot of vanity in ‘The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,’ ” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. There is also a contradiction: “An ordinary fellow should not have to be quite so special to win our admiration.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Too often, though, that escape comes through a fictional world that erases rather than solves the more complex problems of our own, reducing difficulty to the level of personal struggle and heroism, turning all obstacles to monsters we can see and touch and kill with a sword. But N.K. ­Jemisin’s intricate and extraordinary world-­building starts with oppression: Her universes begin by asking who is oppressing whom, what they are gaining, what they fear. Systems of power stalk her protagonists, often embodied as gods and primeval forces, so vast that resistance seems impossible even to contemplate. When escape comes in her novels, it is not a merely personal victory, or the restoration of a sketchy and soft-lit status quo. Her heroes achieve escape velocity, smashing through oppressive systems and leaving them behind like shed skins.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/books/review/the-fifth-season-by-nk-jemisin.html

Alfred Prufrock’’ are fixed in a precise location: the cluttered space of my teenage bedroom floor. It’s 1982. The light is low. The parquet tiles are coming unglued. Album covers — Talking Heads, David Bowie, the Clash — fan out around me, and an array of paperbacks sprawl among a week’s discarded clothes. I begin to read: ‘‘Let us go then, you and I,/When the evening is spread out against the sky/Like a patient etherized upon a table’’ — and, with a 17-year-old’s sense of imminent upheaval, feel the stirrings of a new language in me, connected to my own language but having passed through fire. I can’t say whether the voice the poem puts in my head as it extends its opening invitation is stiffly formal, smarmy or seductive. ‘‘Spread yourself out on the floor,’’ it seems to whisper, ‘‘and prepare to be turned inside-out.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock.html
2015-08-06,Out of the Woods,"Several years ago, David Withers, a zoologist with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, was digging for crayfish in some creek beds on the edge of DeKalb County, in an area that can plausibly be described as nowhere at all, when he spotted an unmarked road. He had never noticed it and decided to see where it led; after a short drive, he found himself amid a strange encampment. Withers stepped out of his truck and looked around. Cheerful, rickety houses sprouted from the ground like unclassified fungi, or something dreamed up by Lewis Carroll, but what appealed to him most was the barn; on the side, in large yellow letters, someone had written ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ Withers walked up to a shack that appeared to be inhabited and — overtaken by curiosity — he knocked. The woman who came out looked surprised. She told him that he was on a commune for gay, lesbian and transgender people and suggested politely that he leave. Later, Withers called his friend Neal Appelbaum, the openly gay director of the arts center in neighboring Cannon County, and told him about what he saw. Appelbaum explained that Withers had stumbled into Ida, a commune for queer vegetarians; the entire region was home to maybe a dozen rural planned communities for L.G.B.T.Q. people, a kind of sexually nonconforming Amish country. He also pointed out that the fading sign on the barn didn’t say ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ The last letter was not an ‘‘e’’ but an ‘‘o.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/magazine/out-of-the-woods.html

This year, Bergman’s legacy will be honored in a centennial celebration opening at the Museum of Modern Art on her bittersweet birthday, Aug. 29, which is also the day she died at age 67 in 1982. The 14-film retrospective spans Bergman’s 50-year career, including her starring roles in “Casablanca” and Hitchcock’s “Notorious.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/isabella-rossellini-on-ingrid-bergman/

It would be a spoiler to say too much about the number that ends the movie, a Bruce Springsteen cover, but the opener, sung to a sparse, appreciative audience at a scruffy club in Tarzana, Calif., is a competent version of an old hit by Tom Petty. (If that name doesn’t ring a bell, go ask your dad.) Ricki, the lead singer, sporting a blue Telecaster, heavy eyeliner and half of Bo Derek’s haircut from “10” (ask your dad about that too), belts out the lyrics with perfect credibility, landing somewhere between Chrissie Hynde and Bonnie Raitt on the spectrum of available reference points.

2015-08-07,What’s On TV Friday,"10 P.M. (Starz Edge) FROZEN (2013) Warm up your vocal cords: This Disney movie musical produced “Let It Go,” the Oscar-winning power anthem written by the married songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa, above (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. “Allegorically, ‘Frozen’ lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

Some research shows that people posed in expansive postures feel more powerful, exhibit higher testosterone levels and have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol — all characteristics of high-ranking social status.

Bared by shorts, they point us toward a few truths about social standards. Women’s legs are tangled in their own sex-­segregated history of social control and gender politics; shorts are, first off, short pants, and it was not so very long ago that women were told wearing pants of any length was prima facie evidence of moral turpitude. The man in shorts, meanwhile, occupies a space that is more subtly strange. Year after year, as surely as tender spring yields to scalding summer, a season of dress-­code controversies gives way to a running conversation about the unwritten rules of urban spaces, with arbiters of taste cringing at men’s legs in shorts as if wincing at a comedy of embarrassment.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/magazine/hes-got-legs.html

Box (whose initials stand for Charles James, dashing your hopes that his full name was Cracker Jack Box) is best known for his series of gritty mysteries about the Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett. But in “Badlands,” a stand-alone suspense thriller new at No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list, Box shifts his attention to North Dakota and the fracking boom; the book, set in the fictional oil town of Grimstad, N.D., is about a 12-year-old boy who witnesses a car accident on his paper route and makes off with the bundle of drugs and money he finds at the scene. As a child, Box had relatives who worked blue-collar jobs in the energy industry — “The house I grew up in didn’t have a single bookcase except mine,” he once told a website devoted to crime fiction — and in this novel he pokes some fun at journalists who reflexively condemn big oil. “They fly all the way here from the East Coast burning up jet fuel,” the town sheriff grouses at one point, “then rent cars and fill ’em with gasoline to drive all the way to Grimstad just so they can trot me out to say, ‘Oil is bad.’ I won’t play their game anymore.” Box has observed reporters up close: He used to be one. “My first job was working for a small Wyoming weekly newspaper,” he told the same website, The Rap Sheet, in 2010. “In retrospect, it was spectacular training in ‘the real world’ for what was to come. I learned so much, and met so many people in all walks of life.

Maybe that’s why so many of the novels we love most, from Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” to Rowling’s Harry Potter series, feature some version of this small person. We are gutted not by Scout or Jem in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” but by Dill, the fatherless fantabulist; we may admire Sara Crewe when she’s a kind little heiress, but she’s truly a princess when she loses both her money and her dad. I’ll read anything that features an invisible, unloved child, an orphan either in reality or spirit, more resourceful than any wee one should have to be. Bonus points if the child finds ways to skirt the law. (I’m looking at you, Addie Pray.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/books/review/crooked-heart-by-lissa-evans.html

Joy Davidman married Lewis, author of the beloved “Chronicles of Narnia,” at 41, and her late entrance into his bachelor existence is a cherished part of his legend. She soon died of bone cancer, but she had made him a husband and stepfather, adding an intimate touch to the genial but distant self-portrait that emerges from his grown-up books, tracts like “Mere Christianity.” Her death was also the subject of “A Grief Observed,” his classic book on mourning and how faith can survive it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/books/review/joy-poet-seeker-and-the-woman-who-captivated-cs-lewis.html

2015-08-07,Robin Williams’s Underrated Roles Help Illustrate His Major Talents,"This summer brings in close proximity two sad milestones for fans of Robin Williams: July 21 would have been the 64th birthday of this inventive comedian and Academy Award-winning actor, and Aug. 11 is the one-year anniversary of his death. It is a bittersweet occasion to reflect on the range of work that Williams created, as he bounded from classically trained stage actor to stand-up comedian, and from a star of sitcoms to a leading man in movies. While a full consideration of Williams’s career would naturally gravitate toward his sympathetic serio-comic roles in films like “Good Morning Vietnam,” “Dead Poets Society” and “Good Will Hunting,” these performances overshadow other, more idiosyncratic but equally vivid efforts — some from a time when his on-screen persona hadn’t completely coalesced, and others he was able to sneak in once his fame was assured.

The novel’s action and humor play to Mr. Lester’s gifts for the same, and working from George Macdonald Fraser’s script, the director attracted an unsurpassable cast, including Faye Dunaway as the lethal Milady de Winter; Christopher Lee as an eyepatched Rochefort; Raquel Welch as Constance; Michael York as D’Artagnan; Oliver Reed as Athos; and a peerless Charlton Heston as Cardinal Richelieu.

2015-08-10,What’s On TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES (2014) In Peter Jackson’s conclusion to the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, above), the hobbit and his companions become mired in a war that threatens to destroy Middle-earth. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, who finds himself at the heart of the story after his imprisonment; Richard Armitage is Thorin Oakenshield, the headstrong leader with a lust for treasure; Evangeline Lilly is the elf Tauriel, who pursues a forbidden love; and Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the dragon Smaug. “What this adaptation of ‘The Hobbit’ can’t avoid by its final installment is its predictability and hollow foundations,” Nicolas Rapold wrote in The New York Times. “It’s been said before, but Mr. Jackson himself is still haunted by the past.” He added: “It’s especially a shame since Mr. Jackson’s original knack for world building (not to mention the sense of humor in his early films) is often missing in the ever-proliferating superhero-franchise worlds that his own vastly successful endeavors no doubt helped encourage. Bilbo may fully learn a sense of friendship and duty, and have quite a story to tell, but somewhere along the way, Mr. Jackson loses much of the magic.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Rather than the usual chocolate gateau, she got ambitious, precision-carving blocks of marzipan-covered sponge cake before painting them with edible watercolors to create what looked exactly like a roast chicken complete with carrots, potatoes and peas. “It’s a weird cross between food and sculpture,” she says. “The main thing for me is that they look like still-life paintings.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/t-magazine/georgia-rose-fairman-cake.html

Trauma, displacement and fanatical hope have marked all new Americans from the occupants of the Mayflower through every subsequent group who came to these shores (or who were brought here by force). This is the unspoken and sometimes unacknowledged fear and fact of being American: These unkind ghosts of our pasts, these specters of previous selves and previous nations that will not be dismissed so easily, always attend our daily negotiations around identity. They cause a torment that can turn us violent, hateful and self-destructive, and the uneasy grace we win is in itself a remarkable thing. The longer our stay in the United States, the fainter the ghosts get, until they are not much more than a vague unsettled feeling that itself causes even more confusion. Novels by recently arrived Americans have tried to negotiate the struggle to fit into a new home that doesn’t always want them, and the nostalgia for all that has been lost. In this way new immigrant literature mimics its antecedents.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/books/review/vu-trans-dragonfish.html

Raised by Montana ranchers in the 1940s and ’50s, Doig lived most of his adult years in Seattle but never really left Big Sky Country. From his early memoir, “This House of Sky,” to this final novel, “Last Bus to Wisdom,” Doig often gave Montana a leading role. Partly because of this emphasis, his work has been hit or miss for me.

2015-08-11,What’s On TV Tuesday,"6:05 P.M. (Encore) BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969) Does it get any prettier than this? Robert Redford and Paul Newman (above right, with Mr. Redford) star as the famous Wild West outlaws on the lam (destination: Bolivia), with Katharine Ross as the woman who sets their hearts aflutter. The soundtrack to their lives: Burt Bacharach’s Oscar-winning score, featuring “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,” which won for best original song, written with Hal David. Much of the movie “is very funny in a strictly contemporary way — the last exuberant word on movies about the men of the mythic American West who have outlived their day,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. And while there are “some bothersome technical things about the movie (the camera is all zoom, zoom, zoom),” he added, “the overall production is very handsome, and the performances fine, especially Newman, Redford and Miss Ross, who must be broadly funny and straight, almost simultaneously. They succeed even if the movie does not.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

This past Easter, our next-door neighbor invited the kids to swim in their pool afterward. In July, a full three months later, we received an email from our neighbor stating: ‘‘Would you mind reminding your housekeeper that they have a large portion of my swimming towels, I was terribly short this weekend. Hope you had a great Fourth of July.’’ This was the first we heard of missing towels. We did not want our housekeeper to think that we or our neighbor thought the children had taken towels that did not belong to them, so we made the decision to purchase 12 towels and give them to our neighbor. We wrapped them up and left them with a note — ‘‘A little surprise for your generosity.’’ A week later, we found the box of towels with a note back at our door — ‘‘I cannot accept these towels and cannot keep them because it is morally as wrong for me to take your towels as it was for your housekeeper’s children to keep my towels.’’ We do not think the children were morally wrong in intent; they simply did what kids do when getting out of the pool — dry off and then wrap in a towel before piling into cars to go home. Had we known about the towels, we would have collected them at the time, but three months after the fact changes how we think the towels should be regarded. The cost of the towels is not really an issue for us or our neighbors. Should we have tried to retrieve the towels from several families before buying new ones? We are almost certain that our housekeeper was not even aware the children were given towels, as she was at our house the entire swim time cleaning up from the meal. Our effort to replace the towels was meant to defuse the situation, not continue into a towel saga.

The law, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed on Tuesday, comes a year after the death of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., sparked nationwide protests. A grand jury in Missouri did not indict the officer, Darren Wilson. Experts said that the use of grand juries in criminal cases already was relatively rare in California. But now prosecutors will no longer have the option of sending difficult cases to grand juries: they will have to decide whether to indict police officers. Because grand jury testimony is often held in secret, Holly Mitchell, the author of the law, said that the change would increase trust in police officers and transparency in government.

Like Baltimore in “The Wire” and New Orleans in “Treme,” Yonkers symbolizes the tortured metamorphosis of the post-industrial American city. And in Wasicsko, elected mayor at 28 and caught in a vortex of racism and fear, it would seem to have a classic tragic hero: an impetuous young man who grows into leadership, is cast out and doesn’t live to see the full fruit of the seeds he planted.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/arts/television/review-show-me-a-hero-focuses-on-a-mayor-in-the-maelstrom-of-desegregation.html

It works for him (he keeps getting hired), and sometimes also for us. Pleasure is, after all, rarely overrated, including in the often mind-bludgeoning arena of franchise cinema, and there’s a lot to be said for watching beautiful people doing very silly stuff on screen.

LeCrone pauses. “Now you have the conversation.” It’s the intensity of this movement — a silent yet intimate exchange between the dancers — that is emblematic of LeCrone’s choreographic style. While working within the classical vocabulary, LeCrone incorporates pedestrian movements — touching hands, hugging — that are strikingly tender. The steps look like ballet, but they’re less formal, more rugged and athletic — and her dancers are certainly not afraid of the floor. “When you go to a big theater and watch 20 dancers on a huge stage, it can feel very distant,” says LeCrone. “But ballet doesn’t have to be that way. It can be more approachable and emotional, less stark and refined.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/emery-lecrone-dance-joyce-theater/

2015-08-14,Colorado: Water Near Mine at Pre-Spill Toxicity ,"The water just below a Colorado mine that poured three million gallons of toxic waste into nearby waterways has returned to pre-spill levels of toxicity, officials said Thursday. The Environmental Protection Agency is still analyzing water farther along the spill’s path — in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation and Utah. Officials in Utah said waste from the mine had probably reached Lake Powell, a major water storage facility for the region. E.P.A. officials have said they will have to monitor the spill’s path for years to understand its full effect. The Gold King Mine, near Silverton, burst on Aug. 5 while workers contracted by the E.P.A. were conducting a field investigation of the mine, which had leaked for years. The agency has said it was responsible for the spill. Levels of metals including arsenic and lead jumped in local waterways as the contamination flowed down the Animas River and into the San Juan, angering many who use these rivers for drinking, irrigation and recreational activities. Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and the Navajo Nation declared states of emergency. The rivers remained closed Thursday.

(Cinemax) SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (2007) Johnny Depp, his skin pale and his eyes odd, stars as the vengeful barber (and earned a best actor Oscar nomination) in Tim Burton’s film of the Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler musical. Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett, the pie maker who disposes of Sweeney’s victims. And Alan Rickman is the malevolent judge who had Sweeney transported to Australia, stole his wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) and now has guardianship of his teenage daughter. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film “as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the ‘Saw’ franchise,” adding, “It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme — I am tempted to say evil — genius.” In “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (2005), Mr. Burton’s sugar-rush adaptation of the Roald Dahl book, at 8 p.m. on ABC Family, Mr. Depp portrays an oddly sinister candy maker, and Freddie Highmore is a boy who wants nothing more than to swim in chocolate. Well, who wouldn’t? Despite burdening Willy Wonka with a psychological back story, “there is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka’s world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “The real lesson of ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ is — or should be — that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

At first, place the toothbrush at a safe distance, somewhere out of reach but visible. Every day, inch it closer until you can hold the brush in your hand while you teach the gorilla to open its mouth. To do this, reward it with grapes, slices of apple, popcorn or juice (Crystal Light is an ape favorite). The first time an animal completes the desired behavior, ‘‘jackpot’’ it, offering 10 grapes instead of one. ‘‘Then they’re like, ‘Oh, whatever I just did I should do it again,’ ’’ Carrigan says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/magazine/how-to-brush-a-gorillas-teeth.html

So uncommonly is it taught, in fact, that without federal largess it would hardly be taught at all.

2015-08-14,Ramiro Gomez’s Domestic Disturbances,"I first noticed the work of the young Los Angeles artist Ramiro Gomez across a series of recent art fairs, on account of those Hockneys of his: that is, paintings that were dead ringers for Hockneys — same scale, same colors, same composition — except that something was always just slightly off. Take Gomez’s large-scale version of Hockney’s iconic ‘‘American Collectors’’ double portrait, for example, which Gomez’s Los Angeles dealer, Charlie James, exhibited at the most recent Expo Chicago. It looks almost exactly like the original portrait of the couple in question, clenched in a grim rictus amid the sculptures in their backyard garden, except that Gomez replaced the two collector protagonists with a pair of dark-skinned gardeners of the sort who regularly do the actual tending of such gardens. Into another Hockney, of one of those nondescript West Los Angeles apartment buildings with its wide front lawn, Gomez slotted a groundskeeper, rake extended. That was the genius of the whole series: how in much the same way that, back in the ’60s, the English transplant Hockney first opened our eyes to so much that we had previously overlooked in Los Angeles, rendering all sorts of things visible to us as if for the first time (those boxy apartment buildings, the distinctive street signs, the moderne furniture, that light), so Gomez seemed to be allowing us, indeed forcing us, to notice the very groundskeepers and housemaids and pool cleaners who make that look, the look of Los Angeles, possible, rendering visible a whole world of people, our fellow humans, who often go unseen (and who, for that matter, because they are sometimes ‘‘illegal,’’ often strive not to be seen).",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/magazine/ramiro-gomezs-domestic-disturbances.html

Fifteen years after the predawn raid by American agents that led to his return to his father in Cuba, he has announced that he would like to visit the United States again. With the thaw in relations between the two countries, the times are vastly different. But as we are expansively reminded in “Make Your Home Among Strangers,” Jennine Capó Crucet’s heartfelt first novel about a Cuban-American family entangled in a fictionalized account of the González affair, no amount of change erases the past.

2015-08-14,"‘The Pope’s Daughter,’ by Dario Fo","Last year, at the venerable age of 88, the Italian comic Dario Fo took on a new creative challenge. The veteran of more than 60 years as an actor, painter, director, stage designer and playwright (as well as the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature), he had in recent years begun to deliver delightful public lectures on artists — Giotto, Leonardo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Picasso — and architecture, including the Romanesque cathedral of Modena. But up to 2014, he had never written a novel. That changed with “The Pope’s Daughter,” now translated into English, although needless to say for this wild man of the theater, the word “novel” is not quite enough to encompass his lightly fictional labor of love for, of all people, Lucrezia Borgia. “The Pope’s Daughter” is also a picture book, illustrated with some of Fo’s own colorful paintings, most based on Renaissance originals. It has since become a full-blown theatrical script. (Meanwhile, Fo has finished a second illustrated novel, inspired by an 18th-century Danish prince, Christian VII.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/books/review/the-popes-daughter-by-dario-fo.html

The harsh realities of daily life under Communism being what they are, disillusionment sets in quickly. Even so, the novel’s dreamy and impressionistic linked episodes, which take the narrator from his boyhood under Brezhnev to his adulthood, offer up this essential truth: Fleeting moments of beauty and love are to be treasured above all else. Carved out of even the most dreary and oppressive circumstances, they’re the sum of a life, a means of triumphing over brutality, a more powerful form of resistance than “dissident whisperings.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/books/review/brief-loves-that-live-forever-and-a-woman-loved-by-andrei-makine.html

Her previous books had captured a zeitgeist. They received rave reviews, sold enviably well and were even quoted in debates in Parliament.

From the moment the book opens, with a long shot of “wheat-yellow plains” around the “dark blot” of a hill in the small country town of Dungatar, we sense that we’re on our way to quirky-indie-movie land; and once the camera closes in on the “tumbling brown house” of Mad ­Molly, “leaning provocatively on the grassy curve,” it’s clear we’re visiting a small 1950s town not of history but as imagined by Tim Burton: the gothic, polarized world of “Edward Scissorhands.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/books/review/the-dressmaker-by-rosalie-ham.html
2015-08-14,Inside the List,"The Dolphin Whisperer: One of the more entertaining figures in “Voices in the Ocean,” Susan Casey’s look at dolphin intelligence — new at No. 13 on the hardcover nonfiction list — is the neurophysiologist John C. Lilly, who before his death in 2001 did as much as anyone to promote the image of dolphins as a nearly alien superspecies that might speak English someday. In the 1960s, Lilly’s unfettered enthusiasm caught on big with a certain segment of the public, but his fellow scientists were less enthralled: As Casey notes, the trade reviews of his 1961 book, “Man and Dolphin,” were scathing. “Scientifically unsound and naïve,” Natural History fumed, judging the book a perfect example of “how not to do scientific research.” The biologist E.O. Wilson called it “borderline irresponsible,” and a Navy researcher snarked: “I find Dr. Lilly’s work very interesting. I like Dr. Seuss, too.” Not that the reviews hurt the book’s prospects: “Man and Dolphin” hit the New York Times best-seller list at No. 15. But Lilly’s reputation as a scientist never quite recovered. “Lilly is so fascinating because he’s so polarizing,” Casey told “Fresh Air” this month. “He was pretty freewheeling about the things he did and the things he said.” Or, as she clarifies in “Voices in the Ocean,”  “The real damage occurred when Lilly began a run of experiments that involved LSD and interspecies sex.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/inside-the-list.html

My father, too, came from an Orthodox background. Both my parents were very conscious of the Fourth Commandment (“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy”), and the Sabbath (Shabbos, as we called it in our Litvak way) was entirely different from the rest of the week. No work was allowed, no driving, no use of the telephone; it was forbidden to switch on a light or a stove. Being physicians, my parents made exceptions. They could not take the phone off the hook or completely avoid driving; they had to be available, if necessary, to see patients, or operate, or deliver babies.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/oliver-sacks-sabbath.html

His dormant killer instincts are activated in the middle of a government operation, letting Mike transform whatever items he has at hand into weapons. An early scene, from which this frame is taken, shows Mike’s skills when, in a 10-second burst of action, he takes down two men sent to kill him by using a cup of noodles, a spoon and the gun they pull on him. It’s a quick but energetic scene that will probably shock the viewer as much as it does the character.

He said investigators were examining whether the killings were reprisals for the recent shooting deaths of two police officers. The killings added to concern among human rights groups over a spate of similar episodes in Brazil that have left dozens dead in other cities, including Manaus and Belém. Police officers killed at least 2,212 people in Brazil in 2013, though the actual number of such killings around the country is thought to be much higher because some states do not report them.

2015-08-17,What’s on TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014) Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his portrayal of the British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who, as a graduate student at Cambridge intent on fathoming the origins of the universe and locating the beginning of time, learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Felicity Jones, who earned a nomination, plays his first wife, Jane Hawking, whose memoir, “Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen,” is the main source for James Marsh’s portrait of a marriage. “Mr. Redmayne, hunched into a wheelchair, the muscles of his face spread into what looks like a permanent smile, must communicate his character’s feelings almost entirely with his eyes, which are remarkably expressive, conveying Stephen’s mischievous wit as well as his intelligence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this best picture nominee. “But it is in showing the application of that intelligence that ‘The Theory of Everything’ tumbles into a black hole of biopic banality.” The film’s historical and scientific lapses have been enumerated, but “taking liberties with facts is a prerogative of storytelling,” he said. The greater failing is that Mr. Marsh seems “unable to capture the spirit and energy of scientific inquiry.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

(HBO) SHOW ME A HERO Nick Wasicsko (Oscar Isaac, above, with Carla Quevedo), a young Yonkers mayor, tries to get the city to abide by a federal judge’s desegregation order, despite savage opposition — and destroys his future in the process — in David Simon’s mini-series, based on a nonfiction book by Lisa Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times. The cast includes Alfred Molina as a machine politician, Bob Balaban as the judge, and Terry Kinney, Clarke Peters and Catherine Keener. “What Mr. Simon and his ‘Wire’ collaborator William F. Zorzi have written, and Paul Haggis (‘Crash’) has directed, is many things: meticulously and cleverly assembled, wonderfully coherent, often moving and funny, painstaking in its evocation of a midsize, tired city in the late 1980s and early ’90s,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “In its later episodes, as the first black and Latino residents move into their new homes in formerly all-white neighborhoods of east Yonkers, it has a real (if modest) emotional punch.

Born in Alaska in 1936 to a father who was a mining engineer, Ms. Berlin lived all over the American West and in Chile, New York City and Mexico. She survived childhood abuse and adult alcoholism, an addiction that sent her, in her words, to “jails, hospitals, psych wards.” She hung out with poets and musicians (marrying two jazz players). By her early 30s, she had been divorced three times and had four sons. She worked as a house cleaner, a substitute teacher and a hospital clerk. She put much of her roving, rowdy life onto the page in vivid stories that garnered the respect of a modest audience and now could be on the verge of making her posthumously famous.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/books/lucia-berlins-roving-rowdy-life-is-reflected-in-a-book-of-her-stories.html

2015-08-17,Mario Vargas Llosa’s ‘Notes on the Death of Culture’,"I call it the newspaper problem: About a decade ago I wrote an essay on contemporary poetry for a newspaper that will remain nameless, and had the occasion to quote a line by “Eliot.” The editor sent back many changes, the most telling of which was that the quotation was now attributed to “the English poet T.S. Eliot.” Vaguely piqued, I asked what the editor was trying to clarify: Was he afraid readers wouldn’t realize the quotation came from a poem? Or was he afraid readers might confuse the Eliot who wrote it with, say, George Eliot, the pseudonymous author of “Middlemarch”? Anyway, I noted that the English qualifier was misleading: Though T.S. Eliot had taken British citizenship, he had been born in America. The editor, then, sent on another suggestion: “the American-born English poet T.S. Eliot.” I, having lost all the patience I had as a 24-year-old, replied by modifying that tag to: “the American-born, British-­citizen English-language poet, essayist, dramatist, teacher, publisher and bank teller Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888-1965),” after which the editor finally got the point and canceled the assignment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/mario-vargas-llosas-notes-on-the-death-of-culture.html

A statement by the group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in The Hague, came a few days after United States officials said Islamic State militants appeared to have used such munitions, possibly mustard gas, on Kurdish fighters in Iraq. If confirmed, it would be the first known use of the weapons by the Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq. The monitoring group called such reports “a matter of serious concern,” and its director, Ahmet Uzumcu, said it would “examine any substantive reports it receives including pertinent information that might be shared” by other signers of the chemical weapons ban, which appeared to be a reference to both Iraq and Syria. Iraq, where hundreds of old, corroded mustard artillery shells remained after the 2003 American invasion, signed the chemical weapons ban in 2009. Syria joined in 2013 after having promised to destroy its chemical stockpile, although the monitoring organization said this year that chlorine bombs had been used in the Syrian conflict. On Aug. 7, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing an inquiry into who was responsible for the chlorine attacks.

Destitute, in a manner of speaking, Jasmine flies first-class to San Francisco to begin life anew with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), whose scrappy existence and brutish men Jasmine can barely stomach without self-medicating with vodka and Xanax. Then she meets a diplomatic type (Peter Sarsgaard) with an appreciation for her decorating talents and designer threads and starts to see light at the end of her dark tunnel.

The Army had begun developing the program as an experiment in 2006; it expanded quickly as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan foundered and American policy makers cast about for novel approaches. The idea was to send teams of social scientists, including anthropologists, to gather ethnographic, sociocultural and economic information and advise front-line soldiers on a range of delicate topics, from the mechanics of forging tribal alliances to how to respond to local offers of hospitality.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/magazine/the-quiet-demise-of-the-armys-plan-to-understand-afghanistan-and-iraq.html

Now, for a restaurant project in a new hotel, Mr. Waxman is reviving Jams in spirit, though not in detail. It is an airy space done in stone and wood, and more rustic than the original, with simpler table settings and dishtowel napkins. Some of the 100 seats are at a long bar, and an open kitchen anchors the rear of the space. Along with grilled chicken with tarragon butter; and red pepper latkes with smoked salmon, corn and California caviar — which are holdovers from the 1980s — Jams will serve brightly accented dishes like rigatoni with crab meat and chile as well as swordfish with grilled pineapple salsa. “It’s my food, less Italian than Barbuto, but still what I like to cook,” Mr. Waxman said. Barbuto is his West Village restaurant, and its pastry chef Heather Miller is making the desserts at Jams, too. Melvyn Master, the wine expert who was Mr. Waxman’s partner and the “m’ in the name (Jams stands for Jonathan and Melvyn) is providing some of his wines to the new restaurant: 1 Hotel Central Park, 1414 Avenue of the Americas (58th Street), 212-703-2007.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/dining/a-jams-revival-in-spirit.html

2015-08-19,Rebecca Stead’s ‘Goodbye Stranger’,"It’s really no wonder 12-year-olds appear frequently not only in novels written for children but also in those written for adults. Taken together, the characters of some classic literature might give the appearance of a middle-school class trip — with the likes of Carson McCullers, William Golding and Vladimir Nabokov in charge, making use of the power of being 12, which is essentially the power of the threshold. If you write a book about characters of this age, you get to document that fleeting moment of change from childhood to not-childhood, when the only person looking out for you might well be you. McCullers’s brilliant 1946 novel “The Member of the Wedding” used a spiky, soulful 12-year-old girl, Frankie Addams, as a vessel for ideas about, among other things, aloneness — both the day-to-day kind and the mortality kind. Frankie’s yearning to be part of something bigger consumes her.

So, over the past decade, there has been a vigorous effort to fortify and rebuild our schools, and in this there is a recognition that we have failed our children, especially those living in poverty, those for whom education could — and should — be transformational. From Chicago to New Orleans, school reform has been engineered by the well heeled and well connected — from hedge fund managers to corporate heads to directors of foundations — who believe that with the right kind of teachers and pedagogy, and with a ­business-like administration, schooling can trump the daily burdens and indignities of growing up poor. “No excuses” has become the rallying cry of the reformers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/the-prize-by-dale-russakoff.html

Myo Moe, a photographer who grew up in Yangon, when its name was Rangoon, when the country was still Burma, invited me to the Moegyo Burmese Food Fair, a fund-raiser for Burmese orphans. ‘‘Here, our community is very tight,’’ she said. ‘‘We come from different backgrounds, but the food connects us — it’s how we’re related to each other. We can’t get it in any store, so when we have our food, we don’t even care about our backgrounds anymore.’’ It was a lovely, hopeful thing to hear about people who come from a place in the midst of a 60-year ethnic conflict.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/myanmars-many-funks-and-flavors.html

The person with whom she was speaking, a department manager, responded that it was a great book and that it must be legitimate because it was endorsed by Henry Ford. I’m uncomfortable that this type of conversation might reflect a negative aspect of our tenant’s company culture. I’m tempted to raise this with the general counsel of the company, with whom I negotiated the lease — but for what purpose? I can’t betray the confidence, so what am I trying to accomplish? I can’t get over that employees working in a respected chain could really accept any premise in that anti-Semitic rant. I thought the reach of the book was limited to uneducated neo-Nazis, but these are educated people in positions of authority.

2015-08-20,What’s On TV Thursday,"10:50 A.M. (Starz) MR. TURNER (2014) A growling, sputtering Timothy Spall, above, stars as J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851), the man the Victorian critic John Ruskin called “the greatest painter of all time.” Mike Leigh’s biographical masterpiece juxtaposes the vexing genius of Turner’s later years and his ramshackle personal life. Turner the painter divined luminously stormy seascapes and placid river scenes that inspired the praise of critics and the envy of colleagues — until his work fell out of fashion. Turner the man lived with his father (Paul Jesson), copulated with his longtime housekeeper (Dorothy Atkinson) and ignored his daughters by his semi-estranged wife (Ruth Sheen) while keeping company with a kindhearted widow (Marion Bailey) whose last name he adopts. “ ‘Mr. Turner’ is a mighty work of critical imagination, a loving, unsentimental portrait of a rare creative soul,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this Oscar nominee in cinematography, costume and production design, and original score. “But even as it celebrates a glorious painter and illuminates the sources of his pictures with startling clarity and insight, the movie patiently and thoroughly demolishes more than a century’s worth of mythology about what art is and how artists work.” He added, “It might be risking Ruskinesque folly to take ‘Mr. Turner’ as a self-portrait of its director, but Turner shares with Mr. Leigh an ability to travel the circuit between the sublime and the ordinary, to bring into view aspects of reality that had been somehow invisible in plain sight.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Fairey’s latest offering, a series of new mixed-media paintings titled “On Our Hands,” will serve as his inaugural exhibition at Jacob Lewis Gallery, effectively consummating a 10-year friendship between the artist and Mr. Lewis, the gallery’s owner and the first director of the influential Pace Prints in Chelsea. “Jacob looks at every aspect of what the artist is doing, not just the genre, the price or how in fashion you are,” notes Fairey from his studio in Los Angeles, where he continues to finalize the collection. “If you look at the other artists he’s worked with, whether it’s Ryan McGinness or How and Nosm, they’re the only people doing what they do.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/t-magazine/shepard-fairey-on-our-hands-jacob-lewis.html

The idea of doing a book about her came from his agent. And even allowing for any prejudices an agent might have about how interesting agents are, it was still a stretch. Ms. Mengers may have been the most glam, powerful, status-conscious, star-snuggling Hollywood power broker of the 1970s, but both she and her way of doing business had gone the way of the dinosaurs by the end of that decade.

Or at least you can start to see it once you’ve come to grips with other, more obvious features of Mr. Kelly’s art: its radical simplicity, its merger of painting and sculpture, its romance with architecture, its contribution to the history of modernism. But all of this absorbing takes time, the way bird watching does. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/arts/design/natures-lesson-on-understanding-ellsworth-kelly.html

2015-08-21,Frederick Wiseman’s Documentaries Defy Straightforward Plot,"The closer it hews to the conventions of journalism, the more documentary filmmaking becomes an art of compression and acceleration. You know the drill. A social problem is explored, a famous or obscure person’s life story is told, a historical episode is illuminated, in a familiar rhythm and pace. Talking-head interviews alternate with archival clips or re-enactments, all in the service of an argument or a plot. Usually it’s all over in about 90 minutes, and you take away a neat little package of outrage, empathy or enlightenment. Even long-form documentaries, like “The Jinx,” Andrew Jarecki’s mini-series on the alleged crimes of Robert Durst, follow this formula, in that they depend on the quickening of the viewer’s attention.

Dickinson’s famous line — “I’m nobody! Who are you?” — is not what you want to hear when you are younger than 30, or, in my delayed maturity, closer to 40. It should have helped, but did not, when one of my favorite high school English teachers, Donald Glancy, explained that you could sing nearly all of Dickinson’s verse to the tune of “The Yellow Rose of Texas.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/books/holding-off-emily-dickinsons-complete-poems.html

They unfold with unusual deliberation in a semblance of symmetry and order that is actually precarious, even volatile. This is especially true of his mature works from the late 1920s to the early 1940s, with their tensile fusions of glowing white backgrounds, black scaffoldings and blocks of bright primaries.

The film belongs to a school of grown-up, low-drama two-handers, of which the most famous example is “Driving Miss Daisy,” but “Learning to Drive” isn’t half as sentimental. As this movie, directed by Isabel Coixet, tracks the deepening friendship between people from different cultures and backgrounds, it acquires an unforced metaphorical resonance.

2015-08-21,Brazil: House Speaker Is Charged," Prosecutors on Thursday filed corruption charges against Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house of Congress and one of Brazil’s most powerful political figures. Investigators said that Mr. Cunha, 56, a conservative evangelical Christian radio commentator who broke from President Dilma Rousseff’s governing coalition, was involved in a money-laundering operation that was part of a graft scheme at Petrobras, the national oil company. His problems intensified in July when a consultant for a Petrobras contractor testified that Mr. Cunha had solicited and accepted a $5 million bribe. Mr. Cunha says that he is innocent and that he will remain in his post. The Supreme Court will decide whether he will stand trial.

In a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials cited concerns over cardiovascular risks of testosterone treatment and suggested that the benefits claimed in ads are unsupported by substantial evidence. The supplements are approved by the F.D.A. for treating classic hypogonadism, which includes well-recognized medical conditions like testicular damage. But most men prescribed testosterone do not appear to have this condition, agency officials wrote, calling the trend troubling. To date, no randomized, controlled trials have been designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes in men taking supplemental testosterone.

Since 2009, when the Obama administration first began trying to close the Guantánamo prison, the executive branch has studied the logistical capacity of several bases to handle such prisoners. President Obama wants to close Guantánamo Bay before he leaves office in January 2017.

Docents decode the work of Leonardo, Rembrandt and Turner; restorers use magnifying glasses, eyedroppers, scalpels and cotton swabs to repair a tiny chip in a painting; senior executives politely battle younger ones, who believe the museum is too stodgy; and connoisseurs discuss the underpinnings of masterpieces by Vermeer, Caravaggio, Titian, Velázquez, Pissarro and Rubens. Mr. Wiseman also makes the point that art is the story of human relationships — in labor, commerce, patronage and even the exploitation of bodies. “Mr. Wiseman’s touch is deft but light here, and the experience of watching ‘National Gallery’ is pleasurable and immersive because he’s a wonderful storyteller,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this three-hour movie. “It is also unexpectedly moving. Because his other great theme is how art speaks to us, one he brilliantly expresses in the relay of gazes that finds us looking at museumgoers looking at portraits that look right back — at artists, art lovers and moviegoers — even as Mr. Wiseman, that sly old master, looks at all of us in turn.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

We lugged the book home (all 160 oversize pages of it) to commune in private with its thick, creamy paperstock full of wisdom about lip shapes, brow bleaching and false eyelashes. We propped it against the bathroom sink as we mashed our fingers into our cheekbones, feeling for deep bone structure. We pored over close-ups of celebrity pores, eager to claim affinity with the actress or supermodel whose skin most matched our own. The girls who learned from Aucoin that they had heart-­shaped faces let everyone at school know about it in the nasal braggadocio common to a certain breed of adolescent queen bee.

Matthew Battles evokes the flexibility of human consciousness and the ability of the written word to absorb and deploy new technologies even though, as he explains, writing has always had its supposed shallows, from “penny dreadfuls” to propaganda and pornography. However, “Palimpsest” puts up a dull defense of its subject. It’s elliptically organized and full of workmanlike, hackneyed prose. It’s a history of the written word, but it’s also a repository of literary missteps.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/palimpsest-a-history-of-the-written-word-by-matthew-battles.html

Whether out of genuine concern about foul play or to salve a worried mother, the doctor filed a suspected child abuse report.

But since the dawn of the 21st century, with the number of immigrants in the United States continuing to increase markedly, children’s authors and publishers have begun to take on a far more challenging task — helping immigrant children settle into a new cultural environment, one that even their parents may find inexplicable. Since the principal obstacle to understanding a culture is, of course, the language that expresses it, language can loom large in these books; and a language divide is a concept difficult to express pictorially. Given all this, a child’s experience of immigration is a subject matter that requires some inventive tactics, as four new books ably demonstrate.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/mamas-nightingale-by-edwidge-danticat-and-more.html

These make more occasional literary appearances — in, for instance, classics such as “Corduroy,” about a stuffed bear alone in a department store, or even “The Little Engine That Could,” with its dolls and small clown — but they really deserve to be more frequent stars.

The stringency in the money market reached such a degree that it precipitated a panic among borrowers and carried the rate of call loans to nearly 190 per cent, the highest rate on record since the chaos resulting from the tragedy of ’81. The demand for funds at this anomalous rate of per cent per day, in addition to the regular rate of interest, cannot honestly be attributed to mere bear manipulation. The eagerness with which long stock was thrown on the market fully attested to the general need for money that prevails in Wall Street. While Wall Street was howling, stocks were tumbling out of sight. The threatened state of affairs on the Vanderbilt railroad system did not improve matters.

Both Mr. Carrey and Mr. Daniels “have slowed down without cleaning up their act,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this comedy from Peter and Bobby Farrelly, which was a critical flop but a box-office success. “To that end, as it were, this sequel is just, uh, packed, or perhaps smeared, with a whole lot of poop jokes. There are diaper gags, lots of them, mostly pretty funny, and a couple of peekaboo looks at a feline rear end.” But, she added, “the Farrellys are still not much interested in film as a visual medium, and when Lloyd and Harry aren’t smacking each other or dropping their pants, you might as well be listening to a radio play.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-08-24,What’s On TV Monday,"9 P.M. (Cinemax) MAPS TO THE STARS (2015) Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore, above), an actress on the verge of unraveling at any moment, has seen the apparition of her mother — a more famous actress, who died in a fire when she was young — and seeks therapy from a self-help guru (John Cusack). He happens to be the father of Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird), an obnoxious young star, and his older sister, Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), who was banished from the family after setting a fire that may have been intended to kill her brother, and which badly burned her. Eventually Agatha befriends a limo driver (Robert Pattinson) and turns an Internet acquaintanceship with Carrie Fisher into a job as Havana’s personal assistant. “Suavely directed by David Cronenberg from an elegantly waspish script by Bruce Wagner, it belongs to the venerable tradition of movieland self-loathing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It takes a perverse effort of will to love ‘Maps to the Stars.’ It’s a little too chilly, and in some places too easy. But you may find yourself drawn back to it, and retracing its route from the familiar to the uncanny, from entertainment to revulsion, from dream to nightmare.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

Yet upon entering Commodore Barry Park for the Afropunk Festival’s inaugural Fancy Ball on Friday night — a fundraiser which opened the 11th annual music spectacle in Fort Greene, Brooklyn — attendees were greeted by eight commandments: no sexism, no racism, no ableism, no ageism, no homophobia, no fatphobia, no transphobia, no hatefulness. “It’s like the most polite people I’ve ever met,” said Manzell Glover, a male bartender in a sleeveless vintage dress who identified as a QPOC (Queer Person of Color). “There was a crowd, but when people have their tapestries down or their blankets down, nobody stepped on anyone’s anything. I’ve never heard ‘excuse me’ so many times,” he said. A retail fashion stylist seated on one of those blankets, Ramie Mitchell, said, “It feels like a no-judgment zone.” Amy Van Doran, a professional matchmaker in a Tang-colored wig, was more blunt in her assessment: “Everyone here is super kind because there is less white privilege,” she said. Headliner Grace Jones took the stage a very civilized 10 minutes early, though she did tell the crowd, drolly and with an expletive appended, “Put down your phones and clap your hands. Put it between your legs if you have to.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/t-magazine/afropunk-festival-fancy-ball-photos.html

(Cinemax) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V.-positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication that is not then legal in the United States. He eventually begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicine for a monthly fee. Jared Leto, in another Oscar-winning performance, plays Rayon, a transgender woman who becomes Ron’s business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and inspired by real events, “is the sense that Ron’s efforts are part of a larger movement,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Ron’s bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaughey’s disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers’ interest in the complexity of the character.

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965, he felt, his daughter Luci said, “a great sense of victory on one side and a great sense of fear on the other.” According to Ari Berman, a political correspondent for The Nation, he knew the law would transform American politics and democracy more than any other civil rights bill in the 20th century, but he also feared that it would deliver the South to the Republican Party for years to come. Both predictions proved to be accurate. “The revolution of 1965 spawned an equally committed group of counterrevolutionaries,” Berman writes in “Give Us the Ballot.” “Since the V.R.A.’s passage, they have waged a decades-long campaign to restrict voting rights.” Berman argues that these counterrevolutionaries have “in recent years, controlled a majority on the Supreme Court” and “have set their sights on undoing the accomplishments of the 1960s civil rights movement.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/books/review/give-us-the-ballot-by-ari-berman.html

With well-mannered neutral-toned surroundings and white tablecloths, they have turned to France for inspiration instead of their usual Italy. Mr. Fakahany pointed out that several French restaurants, including Voisin and Le Périgord Park, have anchored the space, and Mr. White has cooked in France with Roger Vergé and Jacques Chibois. “I can now use lavender, thyme and bay, ingredients that I don’t get to use often,” Mr. White said. Though the name refers to a region of Provence, the food is not Provençal. The menu is broad brasserie-style, offering sections devoted to chilled seafood, vegetables, starters, fresh pastas, main courses and a list of daily specials like blanquette de veau (Tuesdays). The executive chef is Jared Gadbaw. The bar area on the mezzanine has been widened, and a stunning vaulted ceiling has been uncovered; the light fixtures suggest Art Deco. The dining room on the upper level is somewhat less formal-looking than the main room and is accented with cushy dark-sea-green leather chairs.

His Accordion Wallet streamlines motorcyclists’ money-holders and the Key Lanyard resembles the hooded fobs once commonly affixed to car keys. The currant, ochre, white and cobalt blue (or “mineral”) of 1970s auto upholstery hold together the line that’s rounded out by AANDD staples, like the Pyramid Pouch, inspired by a knotted bodega bag. “It’s not a noble inspiration, but it has a good attitude that I can reinterpret in my own aesthetic,” Davidson says. “I’m always watching the way people carry things, wherever I am.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/t-magazine/leather-goods-adam-davidson-shop.html

The husband-wife team of Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley, along with bassist James McNew, who joined the band in 1992, are known equally well for their heart-rending melodies as they are for ear-splitting guitars. For Yo La Tengo’s new record, “Stuff Like That There,” which falls firmly in the former category, the band looks backward to “Fakebook,” an LP that came that out 25 years ago and remains a fan favorite today. Like its predecessor, “Stuff Like That There” is made up predominantly of covers — both of classic acts (Hank Williams, The Cure) and of Yo La Tengo themselves (“Deeper Into Movies,” “The Ballad of Red Buckets”). “We kind of took some of the things from ‘Fakebook’ and said, ‘It’s 25 years later, let’s see what happens if we do it again.’ It’s definitely a companion, in our mind,” Kaplan says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/t-magazine/yo-la-tengo-ira-kaplan-inspirations.html

Its geography is weird, consisting as it does of some 130 assorted islands and atolls, scattered across 1,500 miles of ocean. Its history is spectacularly unexpected, beginning with mass immigrations of Pacific canoeists and culminating in the virtual extinction of an American fleet by several hundred Japanese airplanes.

That these two modes of storytelling — the compact and the commodious; the modern and the historical; the distilling of life into metaphor and its picaresque, riotous expansion — are so obviously the obverse of each other constitutes yet another narrative, the story of how an individual (more specifically, a woman) arrives, after the ­vicissitudes of living, at a definition of self. “Do you want the long answer or the short?” is the customary divide between explanations versus outcomes in the retelling of events.

Across the street was a record shop that sold house music and a drive-through liquor store that peddled home brew in gallon jugs with the promise ‘‘Won’t go flat!’’ In a hot-dog stand on the block, two teenagers once pummeled me with their fists while three of my tennis buddies could only watch, as we were useless at hitting anything other than yellow balls. The original owners of the club soon bailed. The many racquetball courts they had built went mostly unused. The sauna wasn’t properly ventilated and rotted the locker room. A fitness chain eventually rented the space, filling half the tennis courts with weight benches and treadmills; the other five courts remained playable but were invariably coated in tennis ball fuzz, many of their overhead lights askew and glaring or altogether dark.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/magazine/who-gets-to-play-tennis.html

The latest report is the exhibition “Transmissions: Art in Eastern Europe and Latin America, 1960-1980,” which opens on September 5 and will present some 300 artworks in numerous mediums, many on view for the first time. Nearly all date from around 1968, a period when art radically diversified, sometimes dematerializing altogether. These works represent artists from distant regions whose efforts ran parallel in terms of strategies (largely Conceptual, frequently performance-oriented), political contexts (often oppressive) and interests (protest, mass media, popular art). Some names — Valie Export, Ana Mendieta, Edward Krasinski, Juan Downey, Fernando Botero — will be familiar; others will be much less so. The show will surely reflect the MoMA’s desire for a broad global reach, but perhaps also the aesthetic narrowness of its relentless elevation of Conceptual-oriented work.

2015-08-27,Classical Playlist: Mahler and Killer Tuba Songs,"Mahler: Symphony No. 1 Thierry Fischer, conductor; Utah Symphony(Reference Recordings)A cycle of Mahler symphonies was a nice way for the Swiss conductor Thierry Fischer, 57, who took over the Utah Symphony in 2009, to celebrate both its 75th anniversary (in 2015) and the memory of Maurice Abravanel, the orchestra’s great music director from 1947 to 1979. Abravanel, after all, recorded the first Mahler cycle by an American orchestra with the Utah Symphony Orchestra, as it called itself then, from 1963 to 1974 for the Vanguard label. (Leonard Bernstein’s groundbreaking 1960s survey for Columbia, mostly with the New York Philharmonic, disqualified itself with an Eighth Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra.) You would hope that the new performances and recordings would automatically supersede the old ones, but this first disc does not necessarily bear that out. Abravanel’s 1974 First Symphony, as remembered, relies perhaps a bit too much on sheer nervous energy, but it is also more respectful of the subtleties of Mahler’s score.

King Salman, who became king in January, pulled out of a summit meeting with Persian Gulf leaders at Camp David in May. The Saudis have been concerned about the Iran accord but endorsed it three weeks ago, along with other Gulf states, after receiving assurances from American officials. Prem G.

2015-08-27,Palestinians Want to Raise Flag at U.N.," Palestinians want to raise their flag at the United Nations next month, a matter that could set off a diplomatic dispute in the General Assembly. Nearly 20 Arab countries, as well as Senegal and Venezuela, submitted a one-page draft resolution to the General Assembly this week calling for the organization’s two “nonmember observer states” to be granted the right to raise their flags at the gates of United Nations headquarters. The Palestinians gained nonmember observer status in 2012. The only other entity to hold that status is the Holy See. The Vatican did not add its name as a co-sponsor of the resolution. The effort has already met with a rebuke from Jewish groups like B’nai B’rith, which said in a statement that raising a flag was a “privilege” accorded to a member state and that part of the Palestinian territories is under the control of Hamas, “which is openly committed to the destruction of an existing U.N. member state, Israel.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/world/middleeast/palestinians-want-to-raise-flag-at-un.html

2015-08-27,Haunting Images That Make New York Landmarks Feel New Again,"When he landed in New York City as a first-time tourist in 1990, the Finnish photographer Kari Soinio — like so many visitors before and after him — was struck by the breathtaking sweep of the Manhattan skyline. When he returned to live downtown for an artist residency in 2006, his gaze was again drawn upward. “I was amazed by the canyon of high-rises,” he says, “and the whole idea of the newcomer looking up.” It was with this view in mind that he embarked on an ongoing series, “City of Ghosts,” which combines street and architectural photography. Soinio captures the beauty of the city’s renowned landmarks — the Washington Square Arch, the Flatiron and Woolworth buildings — and pulls them into the foreground, while unwitting passersby become shadowy, anonymous characters in a duet between pedestrian and monument. Shooting with a 4x5-inch camera with no viewfinder, the defocused scene is “both familiar and utterly foreign,” as Soinio puts it, thanks to his manipulation of the images’ depths of field. “In the happy accident of photography, if you really know your camera, you can do so much,” he says. As “City of Ghosts” has continued, Soinio has shifted his attention to the changing urban landscape and the new glass towers that now reach skyward. In an age during which it’s never been more tempting to keep your eyes glued to a screen while traversing the urban landscape, his photos are a welcome reminder: Look up!",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/t-magazine/kari-soinio-new-york-photographs.html

In a study published in the journal Science, scientists at the University of Texas, Austin, and at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute suggest that when a social situation becomes too complex, obvious decisions become too burdensome for the frogs. A similar effect has been observed in humans, suggesting that irrationality in mate selection may have deep biological roots.",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/science/a-twist-to-how-a-tungara-frog-finds-her-prince.html

Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs a cafe, where, one evening, his ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman, above with Bogart) turns up with her husband, Victor (Paul Henreid), and Rick becomes tormented by the memory of his life with Ilsa in Paris. Eventually, the cafe is occupied by Nazis as well, and Rick becomes tangled up with them, Ilsa and Victor. The film won three Academy Awards. “Mr. Bogart is, as usual, the cool, cynical, efficient and super-wise guy who operates his business strictly for profit but has a core of sentiment and idealism inside,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times in 1942. “In short, we will say that ‘Casablanca’ is one of the year’s most exciting and trenchant films.

2015-08-31,Arizona: Lawyer Paid to End Suit Against Homeland Security,"The Department of Homeland Security has reached a settlement with the top lawyer in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in Arizona, who sued the department in 2014 claiming discrimination. The lawyer, Patricia M. Vroom, said she was bullied and harassed by officials in Washington because she raised concerns about an Obama administration policy applying prosecutorial discretion to spare some immigrants from deportation. Ms. Vroom will be paid $399,999 to end the suit, and a recent annual performance rating will be revised upward to “achieved excellence.” She had said top legal officials lowered her rating after she moved cautiously to allow the release of some undocumented immigrants with criminal records, a rebuke she said amounted to age and sex discrimination. Her lawyer said that as part of the agreement, Ms. Vroom would retire on Oct. 1 after 30 years working for the federal government. Homeland Security officials did not admit wrongdoing.

They must protect the last real human city, Zion, while battling the machines and the evil Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). “With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of surprise (even when the film’s most important Oracle turns out to be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her refrigerator), ‘The Matrix’ makes particular virtues out of eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. “As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

2015-08-31,What’s on TV Monday,"1:35 P.M. (MAX) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) In this Wes Anderson film, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) tells an author (Jude Law) the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film flashes back to 1932, detailing the friendship between the young Zero (Tony Revolori, center, with Tom Wilkinson, left, and and Owen Wilson) and the hotel concierge, Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is framed for the murder of an aristocrat (Tilda Swinton) and flees with Zero. They are pursued by her family and henchmen (Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe) while trying to protect a prized painting. Zero, meanwhile, deals with romance. “There is no doubt that Mr. Anderson possesses a distinctive sensibility and a consistent visual style, and that instead of striking out in new directions, he tends to embroider and elaborate on familiar themes and pictorial habits,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “You will see many of them here: static, densely packed, fussily composed frames; traveling shots in which the camera glides alongside the characters like a low-flying bird; action sequences that refuse the usual digital hocus-pocus in favor of the older, artisanal magic of stop-motion animation, matte paintings and rear projection. You will also meet eccentric characters possessed by a kind of madcap melancholy, soulful and silly in equal measure.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html
