A spokesman for the group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said the group's executive director, Howard A. Kohr, was surprised and disappointed that he was one of four Jewish leaders who are quoted praising Mr. Bush in a flier last week. Josh Block, a spokesman for the group, said the committee is bipartisan and does not endorse candidates, so Mr. Kohr considered it ""totally inappropriate"" for the Republicans to use his words. Last week, the leaders of two other nonpartisan groups listed in the pamphlet -- the Anti-Defamation League and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism -- also complained about being in the campaign literature. The State Committee said it would not use the names or quotations in future mailings.

2004-11-03,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HENDLER, HYMAN B., M.D.","HENDLER--Hyman B., M.D. 95, passed peacefully on November 1. Hy Hendler lived by these words excerpted from his favorite poem: ""When you get what you want in your struggle for self And the world makes you king for a day, Just go to a mirror and look at yourself And see what that man has to say."" A general surgeon for fifty years, practicing on the South Shore of Long Island, Dr. Hendler started a surgical group in Amityville as well as Hempstead, helped found Freeport and Brunswick General Hospitals and skillfully attended to countless patients. His arduous path to becoming a physician cultivated a profound empathy for patients and his family. Orphaned at 15, he graduated from Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland Medical School despite many hardships. A determined self made man, he applied himself wholeheartedly to all aspects of life. His accomplishments and reputation as a physician were equally matched by his business acumen. Throughout his life many sought his council and few were disappointed by his honest, compassionate and forthright advice. Never one to boast about his own hard earned success, he was a modest man who loved making others laugh. He golfed and played gin as a member of Cold Spring Country Club, and Broken Sound. Hy put his family above all else and we are forever grateful for his profound contemplative generosity. He will be missed and fondly remembered by Ethel, his loving wife of sixty four years. His sons Fred and and Donald, daughters-in-law Nancy and Adrienne, five grandchildren, Ian and wife Debra, Noah and wife Nancy, Sarah, Kimberly and Clinton and three great grandchildren Natasha, Isaac and Julian will all carry on his legacy. Services will be held Friday, November 5th at Gutterman Warheit Memorial Chapel in Boca Raton, Florida at 3pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Boca Raton Hospital in honor of his caring physician Dr. Evan Goldstein.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/classified/paid-notice-deaths-hendler-hyman-b-md.html

The witness, Zakira Shiekh, was scheduled to testify today in the second trial stemming from her case. The Supreme Court ordered a retrial and moved it to Maharashtra State after Ms. Sheikh had earlier recanted her accusations, saying then that she was threatened by Hindu nationalists to do so. It is not clear how her apparent change of heart will affect the trial, because three other witnesses have identified some of the accused.

2004-11-05,MONICA SALMASO,"In Brazil, as in the rest of the world, current pop is coming to terms with the jolts, the swagger and the aggressive present tense of hip-hop. Monica Salmaso, however, has other ideas. Her luminous voice, tinged with melancholy and calm sensuality, is made for quieter moments. On her albums, including her new one, ""Iaiá"" (World Village), Ms. Salmaso reaches into the boundless resources of Brazil's musical past. She rediscovers old songs and finds new ones in old styles: bossa novas, old sambas, ballads. Yet she treats them not as purist remakes, but as modern close-ups. Her voice hovers amid a handful of instruments, with flickers of percussion to hint at regional rhythms from across Brazil or woodwinds to recall old dance bands. She sings about a Brazil full of lovers and history, ancient deities and modern rascals, and the songs become intimate and indelible, turning cultural memories into private reveries. (Tonight at 9:30, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; tickets are $20.)

2004-11-05,CYNTHIA DARLOW,"John Cullum expertly plays the title role in ""Sin (A Cardinal Deposed),"" but the burden of providing this disquieting play with a persistent human heartbeat falls to his co-stars. Mr. Cullum plays Cardinal Bernard F. Law, and the centerpiece of Michael Murphy's play is a re-enactment of a deposition given by the cardinal in the course of a lawsuit brought against the archdiocese of Boston by victims of sexual abuse by its priests. Mr. Cullum's cardinal never lets slip his tight grip on his emotions, measuring out carefully considered responses to a lawyer's aggressive questions. Providing telling -- and touching -- contrast to the cardinal's cool are Cynthia Darlow and Dan Daily, the actors who portray numerous witnesses and relatives of victims. Ms. Darlow, in particular, brings admirable depth of feeling, as well as terrific variety, to her performance. The texts she is given are letters sent to the cardinal and his associates by relatives of victims. But the performance could never be mistaken for a dry reading. It is infused with palpable emotion, from feisty outrage to anguish to bitter disillusionment. It is Ms. Darlow's job to embody the devastating emotional cost borne by the victims and their families, a chilling contrast to the obliviousness of the cardinal. She rises to the challenge superbly.

2004-11-05,PAUL CHAN,"For his debut solo show, ""My Birds . . . Trash . . . The Future,"" Paul Chan has pulled out the stops, offering up a double-channel 17-minute digital cartoon, projected on both sides of a hanging screen, along with charcoal drawings of owls, ravens, hawks and bats, prints and a toy gun with a radio inside that you hear by pointing the barrel at your head. The theme is the apocalypse. Mr. Chan, who's in the current Carnegie International in Pittsburgh and who first generated buzz in a group show here last year with a video riff on the darkling outsider artist Henry Darger, is clearly anxious to impress. Anxiety and war are his main motifs. His cartoon animation (a detail from above) is a bleak, seven-scene saga owing much to Goya, with nods to the Chapman brothers and Leviticus. Lynchings, vultures, orgies and a barren landscape slowly dissolve into a cataclysm of torpid color (from Goya to Rothko), with a soundtrack of hip-hop cellphone rings. The work has the jerky, low-tech quality of an early Nintendo game. It's hypnotic at first, then dull. Slow, it has a roughness that nonetheless sticks strangely in the mind, dovetailing with the subject matter. The accompanying drawings and prints, derived from the animation, are in different modes, as if demonstrating versatility for its own sake. All in all, a mixed bag, disappointing high expectations but worth checking out. (Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, through Nov. 13; free.)

2004-11-05,California to the Rescue,"When California voters enacted a lavishly financed stem cell program on Tuesday, they performed a valuable service that should help keep this nation in the forefront of one of the most promising areas of biomedical research. It was especially important given the big role that religious conservatives, who are strongly opposed to embryonic stem cell research, played in re-electing President Bush. There seems to be little chance that Mr. Bush will retreat from his limits on federal support for such research, and a Congress that has shifted rightward may try, once again, to ban therapeutic cloning, the most promising area of embryonic stem cell research. Now that California has enshrined stem cell research and therapeutic cloning in its Constitution and state law, it may be the engine that keeps the nation moving.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/opinion/california-to-the-rescue.html

2004-11-05,"Arts, Briefly; Masked Meaning","Kemo Sabe, the name given to the Lone Ranger by his American Indian sidekick, Tonto, below, in the popular westerns that ran on radio from 1933 through 1955 and on television from 1949 through 1957, is not a racist term, a Canadian court has ruled. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld a human rights board decision that said a Mikmaq Indian woman, Dorothy Kateri Moore, was not demeaned or offended when her boss at a sports store in Sydney, Nova Scotia, referred to her and others as ""kemo sabe."" The board came to its decision after dissecting a full day's worth of ""Lone Ranger"" television episodes and concluding that although Indians were treated in a demeaning way on the programs, Tonto and the Lone Ranger were in fact partners and friends. Ms. Moore's boss, Trevor Muller, said he believed that the word meant trusted friend. But the exact meaning varies greatly depending on context and the language being spoken. A Mikmaq witness at the hearing said the word meant sneaky. COLIN CAMPBELL",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/arts/movies/arts-briefly-masked-meaning.html

2004-11-05,TRULS MORK,"Growing up in Norway, the cellist Truls Mork got mixed messages from his parents. His mother, a pianist, had great ambitions for him as a pianist. His father, a cellist, decided to teach him the cello, and cello won out. But his father cautioned him not to practice too much, lest he become a musician! Still, his father's challenging ways proved highly influential. Every time young Mr. Mork grew fixed in an interpretive idea about a piece, his father would make him think about it differently. This searching quality still characterizes Mr. Mork's adventurous artistry. He has championed contemporary music, but also founded (in 1991) and directed (until last year) an intensive chamber music festival in Stavanger, on the southwest coast of Norway. His playing can surprise you: one moment cool, articulate and classical, the next rhapsodic, throbbing and Romantic. On Sunday afternoon Mr. Mork performs as part of Lincoln Center's ""Virtuoso Recitals"" series, with the pianist Kathryn Stott, and his program is typically intriguing. He will place Prokofiev's Sonata for Cello and Piano in C in context by preceding it with the Sonata in D minor by Nikolai Miaskovsky, a friend and fellow student of Prokofiev's at St. Petersburg Conservatory. Next comes Janacek's ""Pohadka"" and finally Chopin's Cello Sonata in G minor, a teeming, restless work that would be played all the time if the piano part weren't so difficult. More power to Ms. Stott! (Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; tickets are $40.)

Most cooks are known for, say, their perfect roast chicken or their famous chocolate soufflé cake. But there's no marquee sensation that you can count on from my mother's kitchen, no big event specialties that are part of family lore or concocted only for the holidays. She does not view cooking, as so many self-conscious home cooks do, as a statement of personality. She never fetishizes food, never revels in its currency or the way it can confer coolness on its partakers. She is not, and never has been, interested in anything trendy. To her, cooking is about using everything at hand -- from leftover Halloween jellybeans to the leafy tops of beets that she bought at the farmer's market that morning to a bunch of marrowbones that the butcher was selling cheap. Unlike the home cooks who seem to be mostly concerned about the image their food projects, Stella is only really interested in pleasing herself.

2004-11-08,Borges on the Couch,"There's an unhappy paradox about literary biographies. The majority of readers who will be interested in a writer's bio, especially one as long and exhaustive as Edwin Williamson's ''Borges: A Life,'' will be admirers of the writer's work. They will therefore usually be idealizers of that writer and perpetrators (consciously or not) of the intentional fallacy. Part of the appeal of the writer's work for these fans will be the distinctive stamp of that writer's personality, predilections, style, particular tics and obsessions -- the sense that these stories were written by this author and could have been done by no other.* And yet it often seems that the person we encounter in the literary biography could not possibly have written the works we admire. And the more intimate and thorough the bio, the stronger this feeling usually is. In the present case, the Jorge Luis Borges who emerges in Williamson's book -- a vain, timid, pompous mama's boy, given for much of his life to dithery romantic obsessions -- is about as different as one can get from the limpid, witty, pansophical, profoundly adult writer we know from his stories. Rightly or no, anyone who reveres Borges as one of the best and most important fiction writers of the last century will resist this dissonance, and will look, as a way to explain and mitigate it, for obvious defects in Williamson's life study. The book won't disappoint them. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/books/review/07WALLACE.html

The plot is all about character, and the sterling cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, Mary Steenburgen, Lili Taylor, Daryl Hannah, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Susan Lynch and Rita Moreno.

2004-11-08,The Confessions of John Patrick Shanley,"How can you pass up a chance to attend a family reunion with an Oscar winner who got up and thanked ''everybody who ever punched or kissed me in my life and everybody who I ever punched or kissed?'' Think of the drama, the intrigue, the ice packs. But in a park in Rockland County, N.Y., on a September Saturday, there was nary an Irish temper in sight. The men in John Patrick Shanley's family toted bags of charcoal, raw meat and tongs. The women, like the Italian characters in Shanley's original screenplay for ''Moonstruck,'' unwrapped enormous bowls of pasta salad and oversize platters of deli sandwiches, more than enough for 40. Everyone shared, hugged, talked, showed pictures and yelled at their kids to stay out of the brook. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/magazine/07SHANLEY.html

At this early stage in the harvest, even the slightest nick can become an un-pie-friendly bruise by Thanksgiving. Short and square, in crisp jeans and a denim shirt, the 60-year-old Smith has been farming this Southern root crop for almost half his life. Back in the 1940's, his four uncles began planting sweet potatoes in the sandy loam of Van Zandt county in Texas, about 50 miles east of Dallas; today it's the state's top-producing county. As a boy, Smith helped them harvest, scrambling on the ground to collect the potatoes in the wake of a horse-drawn sled.

In this 1969 satire of the 60's self-enlightenment craze (and the self-righteous proselytizing that often came with it), Bob (Robert Culp), a documentary filmmaker, and his wife, Carol (Natalie Wood), trek to an Esalen-like retreat as research for one of Bob's projects. Although they're skeptical at first -- how could they not be, when one encounter-group denizen announces, ""I'm Myrna -- I came because I want a better orgasm"" -- they end up deeply affected, and return home to share their newfound enlightenment with their best friends, Ted (Elliott Gould) and Alice (Dyan Cannon).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/arts/movies/dvds-to-put-under-trees-remember-when-they-were-tall-tan-young.html

2004-11-08,"DVD's to Put Under Trees; Frankly, It's Better","GONE WITH THE WIND (Warner Brothers, Nov. 9) -- DVD consumers are bombarded with so many special editions that it's easy for them to believe it's all a scheme to pick their pockets. This four-disc set marking the 65th anniversary of ""Gone With the Wind"" is the real deal, a stunning restoration that corrects decades of abuses made in the name of modernization. One of the extras, ""Restoring a Legend,"" has its share of horror stories and heroes, like the music editor who ignored an order to throw out the old soundtrack. He deliberately mislabeled it, stuck it in a can at the back of a vault and kept track of it for decades. What he saved provides this DVD with the original monaural soundtrack (it can also be played in Dolby digital). But the real hero is the chief technology officer of Warner Brothers, Chris Cookson, who found a way to realign the three strips of film used in the Technicolor process. The result: a more crisply defined image, and a richer one, with luxurious colors and textures. And for once, the extras aren't just filler. They include mini biographies of notable cast members, newsreels of the 1939 Atlanta premiere and film of the 1961 Atlanta revival marking the centennial of the Civil War. And what of the movie itself? For all the weight of its classic status and its epic length, it remains a great feat of movie storytelling, and a hugely satisfying entertainment. And next to ""Cold Mountain,"" with its genteel grotesqueries (Nicole Kidman offering to bring lemonade to the ""Negroes""), the romanticism of ""Gone With the Wind"" seems much more honest.

Ostensibly naturalistic, Mr. Brisseau's movies also contain elements of the fantastic: in ""Secret Things,"" a veiled angel of death, complete with raven, hovers in the corners of some scenes.

2004-11-08,Behind the Writer Behind Peter Pan,"LONDON - BECAUSE it is impossible to gain access to the closed set of a writer's imagination, filmmakers love to try. That there is perhaps nothing less cinematic than a writer practicing his craft means that movies about writers have developed their own set of clichés -- the gnawing of pencils, the throwing of endless balled-up drafts into overflowing wastebaskets, the feverish pacing in low-lighted rooms. In the movies, the solitary act of communing with the muse is often portrayed with the forced passion of an obligatory love scene. And the very idea that we want our literary idols humanized is challenged by the reality that it is almost always as disappointing to see a beloved author incarnated on screen as it is to meet him or her in real life.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/movies/moviesspecial/behind-the-writer-behind-peter-pan.html

Using portable hot plates, they've prepared crab cakes with aioli for a gathering of city planners, shopkeepers and artists atop the abandoned elevated railroad tracks in the meatpacking district. They've dished out osso buco for Italian villagers. Most recently, they've served six courses to engineers perched on the Goethals Bridge.

My enthusiasm for the movie kept me tap-dancing to exhaustion, acting my head off (which I learned later in my career was not the best approach) and enthralled with the heady stream of visitors -- which included Cary Grant -- who would come by to see the nostalgically staged musical numbers. The director of the film, Herbert Ross, along with his wife, the former prima ballerina Nora Kaye, were highly regarded in the loftier circles of the New York dance scene, and it was they who took me to my first ballet.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/arts/design/the-masterpiece-in-the-hallway.html

""It took 50 years for Wonder Bread to come in and out and artisanal bread to come back into style,"" says Amy Scherber, of Amy's Bread. An advocate of healthful whole wheat when she began baking in 1992, she soon saw white's virtues; baguettes and rustic loaves are her best sellers. ""The blank canvas for a bread baker is to make a perfect white loaf,"" she says. At a recent exhibition in Paris, it was the muse for Jean Paul Gaultier, who had bakers and pattern makers design everything from bâtards to Birkin bags. White bread also inspired the photographer Kevin Van Aelst. For his series ""The Golden Spiral,"" he sliced a piece of Wonder Bread (""iconic of everything American,"" he says) into fractals to explore the philosophical question When does a fish cease to be a fish? Or a loaf cease to be a loaf? When it stops making us hungry . . . that will be the day. CHRISTINE MUHLKE",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/style/tmagazine/wonder-bread.html

Some Americans admit to asking specific favors from the deity they address, whether healing (45 percent) or something else (43 percent).

The reason is simple: most lack the home phone number needed for random sampling. To get a sense of what the cellphone generation is thinking, Education Life conducted face-to-face interviews in October at 10 campuses: Princeton, Harvard, Ohio State University, Baylor University (Waco, Tex.), University of Texas at Austin, University of Florida, University of Georgia, University of California at Santa Barbara, University of Illinois at Chicago and City University of New York-City College. Interviewers questioned 112 women and 121 men, freshmen to seniors. The students were asked what personal and political issues mattered most to them, about the war in Iraq and about long-term job prospects. In general, they were a hopeful bunch; more than 80 percent were optimistic about their futures. The looming exception was jobs, which more than 40 percent thought would be hard to find after graduation.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/education/edlife/dear-mr-president.html

2004-11-08,"Edie Falco, Unmarried to the Mob","THE cheery applause celebrities get as they make an entrance in a Broadway show has rarely been less appropriate than when it greeted Edie Falco at a recent preview of ""'night, Mother,"" a play in which her character's first bit of business is to find towels so she won't ruin the carpet when she shoots herself 90 minutes later. The ovation was awkward and also late; she had been onstage for a full minute before anyone seemed to realize who she was. Maybe that was because of the way Ms. Falco moved, with none of the Carmela Soprano get-out-of-my-way hauteur that people expect. Maybe it was the relentlessly plain outfit -- a droopy cardigan, jeans, sneakers -- or the unsettling combination of downcast eyes and immobile smile with which she faced her mother, played by Brenda Blethyn, with the news of her impending suicide. Or maybe it was the sparrowy wig. Marsha Norman, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ""'night, Mother"" 21 years ago and has closely monitored this revival, said Ms. Falco became a different person -- the person in the script -- as soon as she put the wig on. ""Edie has hair awareness,"" Ms. Norman said.

2004-11-08,Our National Eating Disorder,"Michael Pollan might have mentioned the socioeconomic origins of fad diets and packaged food consumption. I grew up in a suburban Cleveland family with two working parents in the 1980's. Instead of the beef Wellington and boeuf bourguignon that Pollan's mother prepared, we were raised on such classics as Stouffer's frozen pizza. Our dad took weekly business trips; our mom worked days and went to law school nights. There was little alternative but to outsource dinner. We were alarmed when, following Oprah's lead, our mother stopped eating and went on the Optifast diet, drinking only formula until she crashed to a size 6. Of course she gained all the weight back. This imbalanced attitude toward nutrition, in retrospect, strikes me as a desperate attempt to gain control over a life of incompatible demands.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/opinion/magazine/our-national-eating-disorder-507130.html

2004-11-08,Inside the List,"COMFORT FOOD: Diane Mott Davidson, whose novel ""Double Shot"" enters the fiction list this week at No. 12, writes the kind of mysteries that are called ""cozies."" In the decaffeinated world of the cozies, there's no gore, no steamy sex scenes -- nothing, really, that would feel too out of place in a rerun of ""Murder, She Wrote."" Blandness is a virtue here; so is feline companionship. (""Is the cozy mystery taking over,"" an exasperated Marilyn Stasio has asked in these pages, ""or am I just imagining all these cats?"") Davidson's novels, which are about a small-town Colorado caterer and amateur sleuth named Goldy, straddle another genre, too. Like Fannie Flagg in ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"" and Laura Esquivel in ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" Davidson smuggles recipes into her novels. (In ""Double Shot,"" you can learn to make things like ""Got-a-Hunch Brunch Rolls"" and ""Handcuff Croissants."") This novel is the author's 12th about Goldy and her Goldilocks' Catering company, and the fifth in this tepid, microwaveable series to make the Times hardcover list. Davidson's Web site has a short biographical sketch that notes that at Wellesley College ""she lived across the hall from Hillary Rodham (now Clinton), who drafted her into the Young Republicans!"" The site also includes news about her culinary hits and misfires. ""There was Roquefort Pizza,"" she writes, ""which I pawned off on our next-door neighbors.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html

An experimental vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline to prevent malaria has shown that it can save many children from infection or death, offering the first real hope for containing a disease that kills more than a million people every year. Another experimental vaccine, developed by Merck, has shown that it can provide long-term protection against cervical cancer, which kills some 225,000 women every year, mostly in poor countries where women do not have regular Pap tests.

2004-11-09,As the Arctic Warms,"OPENING WATER -- The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, a study commissioned four years ago by the United States and the seven other countries with Arctic territory, projects that rising global concentrations of heat-trapping emissions will drive up temperatures particularly quickly at high latitudes. Some benefits are predicted. For instance, expanding areas of open water in summer could be a boon to whales and cod stocks. The ice retreat could also create summertime shipping shortcuts between the Atlantic and Pacific and allow oil and gas exploration in previously ice-cloaked waters. But a host of troubles lie ahead as well. The loss of sea ice, for example, could hurt both polar bears and Inuit seal hunters. Details are available on the Web at www.amap.no/acia. ANDREW C.

The word along Broadway yesterday, as well as on its Web sites, was that one of the industry's best known and bankable stars -- Harvey Fierstein, right -- might well be in line for the role. Producers weren't saying, but one member of the production team confirmed that Mr. Fierstein was ""a name on the list"" to play Tevye, the family-beleaguered, tradition-bound patriarch in that 1964 musical by Jerry Bock, Sheldon Harnick and Joseph Stein. And indeed, yesterday the crocodile-voiced Mr. Fierstein was seen eating with the director of ""Fiddler,"" David Leveaux, at the popular Broadway bistro Angus McIndoe, on West 44th Street. While some ""Fiddler"" purists might be bewildered by the idea that the world-weary Tevye could be played by Mr. Fierstein -- most recently a Tony Award winner for his colorful turns as Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" -- the show could use the buzz. At the 1,710-seat Minskoff Theater, where several shows are said to be interested in being the next tenant, ""Fiddler"" played last week to just 52 percent of its capacity.

2004-11-10,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Report Says City Shortchanged On Heat,"New York City receives a disproportionately small share of federal money to help poor families pay their heating bills, says a study released yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office. The city accounts for 42 percent of the state's population but receives only 13 percent -- or $32 million out of $244 million -- of the state's share of the Home Energy Assistance Program. This is because the program, developed by the state, favors homeowners over renters in apartment buildings, as well as renters paying their own heating bills. State officials have defended the program, saying that it has helped many people, particularly in upstate New York, who lived in bigger homes in colder areas. David W.

On NBC, ""The Biggest Loser,"" the weight-loss reality show, improved from its previous episode in both total viewers and in the 18-to-49 demographic. The actual biggest loser of the night was Fox's two-hour series premiere of the heavily promoted ""Rebel Billionaire,"" which beat only UPN's struggling Tuesday lineup. ""Gilmore Girls,"" which is having a renaissance in its fifth year, and ""One Tree Hill,"" continued their winning seasons for WB. At 10 p.m., ABC's hyping of the ghostly appearance of Jimmy Smits, right, on ""NYPD Blue"" yielded the cop show its best ratings of the season but didn't manage to bring it out of its usual third-place position. The third hour of the C.M.A. Awards show won the time slot, and ""Law & Order: SVU"" drew 14.29 million viewers versus 10.73 million for ""NYPD Blue.""

2004-11-11,Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Study Says Defibrillators Are A Bargain,"Implanted electrical shock devices called cardioverter-defibrillators are a relative bargain compared with many other life-saving technologies used in medicine, according to data presented yesterday at an American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans. Dr. Daniel B. Mark of the Duke Clinical Research Institute reached that conclusion based on a review of the costs of implanting the devices in patients who were part of a previously reported clinical study. That study established that use of the devices in patients with moderately weakened hearts cut death rates by 23 percent in the year after the implant. Defibrillators detect disruptions in the rhythm of the heart and jolt it back to a normal pattern before a full-scale heart attack occurs. Dr. Mark said the devices in the clinical study cost an average of just over $33,000, well below the $50,000 level widely used as a benchmark for cost-effective life-saving therapies. Although Dr. Mark's study has not yet been reviewed by independent researchers or published, doctors who attended the presentation said the study could encourage cardiologists to embrace the implants more rapidly. The implants are made by companies like Medtronic, Guidant and St. Jude Medical. Barnaby J.

BTX, originally created by Intel and made into an industry standard, works to remove a PC's heat more effectively. It arranges the PC's three hottest components -- its processor, chip set and graphics card -- in a row to place them inside an airstream flowing from the machine's front to its back. Other components, like memory, are also repositioned to aid air flow. The airstream -- which Gateway calls the wind tunnel and creates in its 6300 desktop by locating a fan on either end of the chassis -- cools the processor and other components more effectively than that of an ATX motherboard, today's standard board design. The company says that reducing the temperature inside a PC's chassis can increase the lifespan of its components, which can fail if they overheat.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/11/business/technology/technology-briefing-hardware-gateway-to-introduce-new.html

2004-11-12,"Arts, Briefly; 'Hot 97' Aims to Be No. 1 in New York Radio","There will be a change at the top of one of New York's most popular radio stations, WQHT-FM (97.1), the hip-hop and R&B station that calls itself Hot 97. The trade paper Radio & Records reported yesterday that John Dimick, a 25-year radio veteran currently working in San Diego, would take over as WQHT's program director in mid-December, succeeding Tracy Cloherty, who has been at the station for 15 years and will now become its programming consultant. In New York's fiercely contested radio wars, WQHT, owned by Emmis Communications, was tied for second place with two other stations in the October Arbitron ratings. Clear Channel's adult contemporary WLTW-FM (106.7) holds the city's No. 1 spot. Mr. Dimick has a history of success in pitting smaller companies like Emmis and his current employer, Jefferson-Pilot, against giants like Clear Channel and Infinity. Emmis, which is based in Indianapolis and owns fewer than 25 stations nationwide compared with Clear Channel's 1,200-plus, has 3 of New York's top 15 stations. Arbitron says the New York radio market has more than 15.3 million listeners 12 and older, far and away the most in the country.

2004-11-12,The Listings; STEVE REICH AND MUSICIANS,"The textures and rhythms that drive Steve Reich's music have changed considerably (if gradually) since the 1960's, but his style has always been immediately recognizable, and distinct from that of others in the increasingly misnamed Minimalist school. Presiding over his ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians (above Mr. Reich, left, and Russ Hartenberger), he is presenting a three-concert series at the Metropolitan Museum that should allow listeners to take stock of his career. One could also, of course, do that by way of ""Steve Reich: Works 1965-1995,"" an extraordinary 10-CD set from Nonesuch, but the Met series includes works composed since that set appeared -- including the fantastic ""Three Tales"" (2002), a music and video work with which the series ends in April. Plus, there is a visceral quality in live performances of Mr. Reich's work that recordings never entirely capture. A centerpiece of the first installment of the series, tomorrow evening, includes the opening section of one of his true classics, the hypnotic and rhythmically involved ""Drumming"" (1971). Somewhat less celebrated, but just as important in Mr. Reich's canon, is the ""Sextet"" (1984), a work for percussion, piano and synthesizer, and one of several works in which Mr. Reich began to take a fresh look at harmonic movement (in addition to his earlier rhythmic layering). Also on the program are ""New York Counterpoint"" (1985), for clarinet and 10 more taped clarinets; ""Nagoya Marimbas"" (1994), a short work for marimba duet; and the American premiere of ""Dance Patterns,"" a 2002 work for two xylophones, two vibraphones and piano. (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $35.)

2004-11-12,The Listings; LARS ARRHENIUS,"What if the blocky universal symbols for man and woman, like those designating public restrooms, had lives of their own? In his New York debut at Feigen Contemporary, the Swedish artist Lars Arrhenius provides the answer: They would do the same stuff we do, only in two dimensions and without words. Working with cartoonlike storyboards, on maps or in digital animation, Mr. Arrhenius explores the narrative possibilities of international sign language, pushing it into new, often subversive territory. He gets an amazing amount said about life in general and in particular. His animation ""The Street"" (stills, above) chronicles a day and a night in the life of a crisp black-and-white universe where people live, die, give birth, watch television, go to work, make love and walk the dog, all with machinelike regularity. Much messier narratives unfold side by side in ""A-Z,"" which makes brilliant use of the street map of London; in ""Habitat,"" which depicts the standard daily occurrences in an apartment building, from personal crises to neighbor problems; and in ""The Man Without One Way,"" which spells out the possible risks of walking home in vivid detail. (You don't always get there.) ""WWW"" uses a map of the world to comment on the state of the planet and confirms its title's double meaning: World Wide Web can also mean World Wide War.

Wednesday's 8 p.m. hour is an interesting study in demographics, as UPN's ""America's Next Top Model"" and WB's ""Smallville"" come in fifth and sixth place in total viewers but place third and fourth in the coveted 18-to-49 grouping, beating CBS's ""60 Minutes 2"" and NBC's ""LAX,"" which appeal to older audiences. At 9 p.m., ""The West Wing"" continues to win the hour for NBC, seeming to defy predictions that this season would be its last. Some 15.18 million viewers tuned in to watch the introduction of Jimmy Smits' new character, and next week will bring Alan Alda (left) to the cast. ""Law & Order,"" on NBC, and ""CSI: NY"" on CBS continue to run neck and neck at 10 p.m. ""Law & Order"" drew more viewers over all, but ""CSI: NY"" decisively won among the 18-to-49 audience.

His first Nonesuch album will appear early next year, and his concert tomorrow night at Zankel Hall is part of ""In Your Ear,"" a weekend full of programming by John Adams, a fellow Nonesuch artist. One hopes Mr. Redman isn't planning a genre-crosser, yet another argument that jazz can coexist with pop music. He's done that a few times already -- and so have many others, without much to show for it. Perhaps this concert indicates what's to come. It features a new trio, including the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Ali Jackson -- guarantors of good, lean swing. Anyway, Mr. Redman, at his best, has a naturally sunny improvisational flow; he's got the spirit of a pop musician even in his deepest, most serious jazz mode.

He held the position of Attending Surgeon in Otolaryngology at both Manhattan Eye and Ear and New York Hospitals and was a Clinical Professor at Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York City. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Otolaryngology and a Fellow of the American Triological Society and past Vice President of the American Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine.

Dr. Coleman created and produced ""Here's to your Health"" an early television series for the Medical Society of New York County and the National Broadcasting Company. He authored several books including ""Freedom from Fear"" which was translated in 12 languages and another widely used children's book ""A Visit to the Hospital"" intended to allay the fears of children facing surgery. Shortly before his retirement in 1999, Dr. Coleman spoke of how gratifying his life in medicine had been made by his patients and how grateful he was to them for their devotion to him. Dr. Coleman is survived by his wife Elizabeth, daughters Lynn Dale and Lisa and his beloved grand-daughter Sarah Elizabeth.

2004-11-15,Transporting Beauty,"""There was always a relentless effort in American cinema to clean up American women on-screen as opposed to their European sisters, who could remain more dissolute. There's been a line of Hollywood stars back to Greer Garson, Grace Kelly and Doris Day. A lot of the younger actresses have inherited that mantle of being decent, not being Frances Farmer, which is sort of what these pictures of Julia court. She's not dressed for going out; she's not dressed for anyone seeing her. These are really haunting pictures. It moves her image in a direction that can speak to me as a connoisseur of New Wave cinema or of the more outsize beauties of the 50's or 60's. They gave me a little déjà vu in a way that was more personal almost than historical. When I saw that first one, I said, 'Oh, I know her.' Not as Julia Roberts, not as Sophia Loren or Jeanne Moreau, but there was a kind of uncanny familiarity.""

And from the moment Halo 2 finally went on sale, gamers have burned countless hours mastering Halo 2's fancy new weapons and exploring its expanded humans-repel-alien-invaders narrative. But for filmmakers like Burnie Burns, who work in the emerging medium of machinima, these features are a mere starting point. Instead of playing Halo as intended, Mr. Burns and a crew of machinima peers exploit the game's software quirks to create their online comedy series, Red vs. Blue, within Halo's virtual world. Since its debut in the spring of 2003, Red vs. Blue has rivaled Halo itself in popularity; fans download new episodes (www.redvsblue.com) at a rate of over 900,000 a week.

They plead, they weep, they bow their heads and then, more often than not, they die. It has been like this since Daniel Pearl was made to repeat ""My father is Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I am Jewish"" before being decapitated. Thanks to the news editors, we rarely if ever see the footage to its gruesome conclusion, but the full versions of these films, reproduced on CD's, sell by the thousands in the marketplace in Baghdad.

Osteen, who is 41, runs the Lakewood Church in Houston, which in the last five years has become America's largest church -- some 25,000 people attend services there each weekend. His television show, seen in 150 countries, reaches millions more. Osteen definitely thinks increase: he plans to move his church into the Compaq Center, formerly home to the Houston Rockets, sometime next year -- after he has fitted it out with twin waterfalls. Osteen describes Lakewood as ""a nondenominational charismatic church."" There's no fire-and-brimstone here, or in his book. Osteen has become known as ""the Smiling Preacher,"" and among the themes he hits regularly is the need to shed your ""poverty mentality."" Having trouble at work?

2004-11-15,"June 16, 2005","In more than four decades of steady stage work, Vanessa Redgrave has played 'em all, more or less. Her Chekhov roles have ranged from Nina in ""The Seagull"" to Ranevskaya in ""The Cherry Orchard."" She's portrayed Shakespeare's Rosalind and Cleopatra and even Prospero. Last year she tackled one of the American theater's most formidable challenges, Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" winning her first Tony Award. But her stage résumé, intriguingly, doesn't feature much Greek tragedy. (She was Katharine Hepburn's co-star in Michael Cacoyannis's 1971 movie of Euripides' ""Trojan Women."") It's fitting, then, that for her return to the Royal Shakespeare Company after a four-decade absence -- itself a somewhat historic occasion -- Ms. Redgrave has decided to add a tragic heroine to her repertory. Now 67, she is perhaps beyond the proper age for Euripides' most famously enraged females, Medea and Electra. Instead she'll play the title role in his ""Hecuba,"" a lesser-known but no less bloody tale of a woman exacting vengeance for the loss of her throne and the murder of her children. The production arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 16 for a 10-day run. Subscriptions to the academy's spring season go on sale tomorrow, and single tickets for ""Hecuba"" will go on sale Jan. 3; ticket services, (718)636-4100.

The tax rate paid by affluent, productive people is so high that they have little incentive to take on extra work. More middle class families each year are stuck with paying the steep alternative minimum tax.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/weekinreview/if-a-tax-overhaul-has-winners-it-will-also-have-losers.html

2004-11-15,Fringe Beneficiaries,"ADRIANO SHAPLIN has a long history of precocity. At 15, he was writing and performing solo shows and acting with community theater groups in Burlington, Vt. At 17, when he was at Sarah Lawrence, he founded the Riot Group with two other students, Stephanie Viola and Drew Friedman. They put on their first shows in dorm rooms, basements and cafes. In the summer after sophomore year, the Riot Group scored a stage at last, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where it performed ""Why I Want to Shoot Ronald Reagan."" The group returned in 1999 with ""Wreck the Airline Barrier,"" which won a Fringe First. The group has since won twice more. So it is not surprising that at 25, Mr. Shaplin has two plays running off Broadway, ""Hell Meets Henry Halfway,"" an adaptation of Witold Gombrowicz's ""Possessed,"" and ""Pugilist Specialist,"" a taut psychological drama about American marines involved in a ""black op"" in the Middle East.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/theater/fringe-beneficiaries.html

The camera has ineptly caught just one dimple and, on the other side of Wills's face, what is either a long sideburn or one half of a straplike beard unaccompanied by a matching mustache. The picture is charming, though its subject might just as well be an early software engineer or a polymath cabdriver.

There is, however, another set of Hollywood statistics of enormous significance, and Tuesday is their day. How important are these numbers? Every Tuesday at lunchtime, Mike Dunn and Peter Staddon, the president and executive vice president, respectively, of 20th Century Fox's home-entertainment division, take the elevator from ther 25th-floor offices at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles down to their cars in the underground parking garage and from there drive out into the noontime traffic on their way to Best Buy, Target, Costco and Wal-Mart. Tuesday is the day new DVD's are released, the day Dunn gets a sense of whether the discs that his team has worked on for months -- or sometimes years -- will sell as well as planned. So the Fox executives wander the aisles of the big retailers. They eavesdrop. They size up the clientele. They take note of what's moving through the cash registers.

A mix of audacity, talent and, of course, beauty characterizes each of the women photographed here, but it is the complexity of their performances that ultimately sets them apart. Take the English actress Emily Mortimer, who first garnered attention for a scene in ""Lovely and Amazing"" in which she asks her lover to critique her naked body. It is a riveting moment that illustrates Mortimer's ability to balance comedy and pathos -- traits that also define her character as a single mother in the forthcoming ""Dear Frankie."" The Argentine actress Mia Maestro, who stars in ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" will play a deeply religious teacher who seems haunted in ""The Holy Girl""; it's as if devotion had taken possession of her entire being. Similarly, when Marilou Berry, the ignored daughter of a self-absorbed author, breaks into song in the French film ""Look at Me,"" her character is transformed. Aishwarya Rai, the highest-paid actress in Bollywood, dazzles as Lalita, the Elizabeth Bennett character in the U.S.-distributed film ""Bride and Prejudice."" The Beijing-born actress Zhang Ziyi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") can next be seen as a blind, knife-throwing courtesan in the sumptuous ""House of Flying Daggers.""

For ""Tree: A New Vision of the American Forest"" (Barnes & Noble Books), James Balog photographed 92 superlative specimens in novel ways: swathing Texas live oaks in white nylon to make their ropy torsos stand out in stark relief, and turning a saguaro cactus into a bleary dream of ridges and spines by shooting it with a $16 plastic Holga camera. But it was his full-length images of the big guys -- Stagg, a 242-foot giant sequoia, and Stratosphere Giant, a 369-foot coast redwood that is officially the world's tallest tree -- that required every bit of Mr. Balog's ingenuity.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/a-photograph-as-lovely-as-a-tree.html

Marley, who was born in Jamaica and died of cancer in 1981, was named an honorary member of Britain's Music Hall of Fame this month and has long been one of the music industry's biggest posthumous earners.

The service, costing about $5 a month, allows callers to dial a number by speaking into the phone. Verizon says that because a manufacturer no longer makes parts for equipment related to the service, it will discontinue voice-dialing in February. At a City Hall news conference, Ms. Gotbaum, above, said Verizon should provide customers with an alternative, and she faulted the company for announcing the change using a letter to customers that she said was printed in small type that was difficult to read. Jim Smith, a spokesman for Verizon, said that for about $200, customers could purchase a voice-dialing device that attaches to a phone and does not require a monthly fee.

Revenue rose 30 percent, to 312 billion yen, helped by an increase in orders for machines used to etch circuits on silicon wafers. Profit in Nikon's core camera division fell compared with last year, as a sharp decline in sales of traditional film cameras more than offset a rise in sales of digital cameras. Sales of film cameras are expected to continue falling, and Nikon also warned that it expects the pace of growth in digital cameras to slow later this year. Still, the company kept its profit forecast for the year ending next March unchanged at 28.6 billion yen, compared with 2.4 billion yen last year.

Justice Laura D. Blackburne of State Supreme Court in Queens ruled in December 2002 that Queens prosecutors had taken more than their allotted six months to bring Mr. Hodges's case to trial and dismissed the attempted murder charges against him. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, who appealed her decision, said yesterday's ruling ""corrects what would have otherwise been a gross miscarriage of justice"" and declared that his office would begin prosecuting Mr. Hodges. The also judge came under criticism in June, after she let a robbery suspect in her courtroom elude detectives by letting him out a back exit.

2004-11-18,"Arts, Briefly; Runnicles Flip-Flops","It seems that the well-regarded conductor Donald Runnicles, below, can live with President Bush, after all. After being quoted by an Austrian newspaper in August to the effect that he might have to leave the United States if the president won re-election, Mr. Runnicles has agreed to a three-year extension of his contract as music director of the San Francisco Opera. The contract was to have ended in 2006. Mr. Runnicles told the newspaper, Der Standard: ""I would really have to think about whether I could stay there if Bush wins a second time. The American public can be wrong once, but if they re-elect him, that means they really want him."" The remarks caused a ruckus in Georgia, where Mr. Runnicles is principal guest conductor of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra distanced itself from his words, and the Scottish-born Mr. Runnicles, who lives in San Francisco, apologized. Through a spokesman at the opera, Mr. Runnicles said he had no further comment. The remarks have apparently had little effect on his reputation in California, where the San Francisco Opera presented a 50th-birthday concert and gala for him on Tuesday night. He was presented with the insignia of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, granted by Queen Elizabeth II in June. Mr. Runnicles is also principal conductor of the Orchestra of St. Luke's.

With 128 megabytes of storage, the camcorder, available online for about $215, can hold up to 25 minutes of MPEG-4 video, 200 two-megapixel pictures, about 32 MP3 songs, documents, or a combination of the four. Images are framed on a tiny liquid-crystal display and transferred through a U.S.B. connection (PC's only). CNET Review: Key019 Check PricesEASY BURNCamcorder owners in a hurry to share their video on DVD can eliminate the connect-the-camera-to-the-computer step with the Sony DVDirect, a portable DVD recorder that plugs into the camera or VCR. The 1.2-pound unit ($300; www.sonystyle.com) also serves as a double-layer DVD recorder when connected to a Windows PC. PICTURE THISThe Nikon D70, a six-megapixel digital single-lens-reflex camera, has turned advanced amateurs and professionals into swooning devotees. Highlights of its feature list: zero start-up time, near-zero shutter lag, three-shots-a-second burst mode and a long-life battery. It isn't cheap ($1,000, not including a lens; nikonusa.com), but cameras of this caliber cost $25,000 only four years ago. CNET Review: Nikon D70 Check PricesREADY, STEADY, GOImprovements in zoom lenses mean many photographers can use a single lens in nearly any situation. But at telephoto settings, zooms can produce blurry photos. The Canon EF 28-to-135-millimeter I.S. zoom lens ($480; canonusa.com) uses electronics to overcome the problem. Sensors in the lens trigger motors that counteract shake. The lens, available online, is compatible with Canon single-lens-reflex cameras. All Canon ProductsVIDEO VERSATILITYNo larger than an iPod and weighing only 4.2 ounces, the Panasonic D-snap (more specifically, the SV-AV50) retains many of the features of bigger camcorders. The D-snap records in television-quality MPEG-4 at 30 frames a second. The camcorder ($400; www.panasonic.com/d-snap) is also a two-megapixel still camera, an MP3 music player and a voice recorder. All Home Video ProductsSHOWOFFThe Epson P-2000 gives photographers an easily portable 40-gigabyte hard drive for offloading images from a camera or card. But its small, bright liquid-crystal display also displays photos with the quality of a good computer monitor. The $500 unit (www.epson.com) has built-in readers for Compact Flash and Secure Digital cards. It can also be used as an MP3 song player for times when the photos don't tell the whole story. All Digital Camera ReviewsSPOT ONHere's a midrange camcorder (about $520; www.sonystyle.com) with a lot to like. When focusing manually, for example, you turn a ring on the lens, rather than fussing with a menu or a button. The flip-out screen, at 3.5 inches, is the largest available, which makes reviewing video more pleasant. It's also a touch screen, which you use for some advanced controls (a design that can be a blessing and a curse). As long as the light is good, the captured video is bright, colorful and sharp. All Camcorder ReviewsQUICK DRAWIf your digital camera's shutter lag has condemned you to missing photos of pet tricks and soccer goals, you need one built for speed, like this un-aerodynamic but rewarding camera, the EX-P600 Exilim ($550; www.casio.com). It's ready to shoot in three seconds, which includes the time it takes to extend its 4x zoom lens. And the autofocus and shutter-lag times are as close to zero as you'll find in a digital camera under $1,000. All Casio Exilim ProductsSNAPSHOTS NOWA ritual after some family gatherings is the printing and mailing of digital snapshots. The Hewlett-Packard Photosmart 375 printer (www.hp.com), however, can go along to the party. When closed for travel, the $200 inkjet printer looks like a small toaster.

The iPac H4155 has 56 megabytes of free memory, a 400-megahertz processor, Bluetooth for connecting to laptops and cellphones, Wi-Fi for hopping onto Internet hot spots, and a bright screen. There aren't as many programs available for the PocketPC operating system as there are for the Palm OS, but this $450 beauty () is a sweet option if you're in a Microsoft state of mind.FORM AND FUNCTION Logitech's V500 Cordless Notebook Mouse not only makes an artful statement, but speaks volumes about clever engineering. The $70 optical mouse (www.logitech.com) links to a laptop through a small receiver that plugs into a U.S.B. port. When not in use, the receiver stows neatly inside the mouse.The V500 runs on two AAA batteries and features a four-way scroll panel rather than a typical scroll wheel.MEMORABLE PalmOne's latest palmtop lacks a voice recorder, vibrating alarm and Wi-Fi for wireless Internet, but it does something no other palmtop can do: when connected to a Mac or PC by a U.S.B. cable, the T5 ($400) becomes a 160-megabyte flash drive to transfer any kind of file. The bright, crisp screen has the highest resolution of any palmtop, and you can rotate it 90 degrees to read spreadsheets and Web pages.SHARP STORAGE The SwissMemory U.S.B. has the familiar blade, nail file, screwdriver and tiny scissors you would expect in a Swiss Army knife, but it also has a 128-megabyte U.S.B. flash storage drive. More information on the SwissMemory, which has a list price of $82, is at www.victorinox.com. For air travel, the flash drive is detachable so the knife itself can be stowed in a checked bag.CELL CINEMA Why settle for plain old pictures on your wireless phone when you can get them up and moving? With LG's VX7000 phone, you can take 15-second videos and send them to your friends. The phone ($200 at www.verizonwireless.com) has four megabytes of storage space for games, ringtones and other goodies.COOL RUNNING Turning the 12-volt DC power from a car's auxiliary outlet into 120-volt AC for a laptop or cellphone charger usually involves a bulky metal box. Most of that bulk is there to draw off heat from the electronic components. The $45 Xantrex XPower Micro Inverter 175 (www.xantrex.com) uses a tiny cooling fan, making it small enough to plug directly into most car outlets.THUMB CANDY The BlackBerry is a hit with white-collar types. But why should corporate America have all the fun? This new model, offered by T-Mobile, is designed and priced for consumers ($200; www.t-mobile.com). It offers the same real-time e-mail features but looks more like a conventional phone. A complete alphabet is on just 20 roomy keys. You can watch the bright screen as the smart software deduces the word you're trying to type and finishes it for you.NO STRINGS The thumb-size Air Station 54 Mbps wireless adapter from Buffalo Technology brings Wi-Fi connectivity to PC's and laptops, but with an extra measure of portability: plug it into a U.S.B. port and it installs the necessary drivers and software. No installation CD is needed. Available at buy.com for $61, it is compatible with Windows-based PC's and the 802.11g and 802.11b Wi-Fi standards.WHAT AND WHERE Most electronic maps and travel guides online and on CD's are designed with motorists in mind, not tourists making their way on foot. Fodors has bundled electronic versions of nine of its city guide books with maps designed for walkers. Guidebook listings like restaurants are linked to the maps. The packages, which cost $20 and are available for download from www.fodors.com, can be viewed on most PocketPC and Palm OS hand-held computers.STREET SMARTS Computerphobes need not fear the Garmin 2620 StreetPilot - a Global Positioning System navigator that comes with maps of the United States and parts of Canada loaded on its 2.2-gigabyte microdrive. The device can tell you where you are, map a route to your destination, and issue audible directions as you go. Garmin now offers a $100 rebate on the 2620, which can be found online at prices ranging from $950 to $1,500.

Mr. Wilkinson, who is now designing headquarters for Google in the Silicon Valley and for J. Walter Thompson in New York, chose water, a scarce resource that dominates this city's imagination, as a primary theme for the project. He transformed ground-floor spaces with 18-foot ceilings in a 1926 building into varied study and meeting spaces. His design includes the aqueous blue pod, top, for design meetings, and a sort of abstracted waterless ""swimming pool,"" above left, with a giant lampshade adorned with palm trees. The walls are lined with a cactus design fabric by Marimekko. Taking suggestions from the young architects in his office, Mr. Wilkinson designed seating that he thought would appeal to the school's students, including the swimming pool itself, for relaxing; the lounge chairs around it, with computers on movable trays; and the flat Japanese-restaurant-style cushions and low tables, above right. His aim, he said, was to project himself ""into the world of the students"" and design from there.",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/style/home and garden/currents-los-angeles-architecture-california-dreamin.html

In most binocams, the camera uses its lens rather than the binoculars' for zeroing in on subjects. That can lead to framing errors. In Bushnell's $600 Instant Replay, the camera is integrated into the binoculars. The camera can also record short low-resolution videos.MULTITASKERThe TotalFit from Bell, the maker of protective helmets and other safety gear and accessories, has a double identity. Mounted on a bicycle, it is a speedometer, but clip it to your belt and it becomes a pedometer. It keeps track of the calories you've burned during your walk, run or ride. The $20 device, available at sports and toy retailers and at sites like fogdog.com, has an easy-to-read display and can be set to English or metric units.TIME CHECKThe Casio Atomic Solar G-Shock (GW700A-1V) wristwatch gets its power from the sun and its accuracy from the government.

WATCH THIS SPACEIf you have a high-definition TV, you have spent a lot of money for something that is probably turned on for a few hours a day at most. With the slim $300 Roku HD1000 media player attached, however, your screen can also be a breathtakingly high-resolution picture frame that (if you buy the optional Art Paks, at rokulabs.com) displays works of art, animated nature scenes or an animated tropical aquarium.

A panel of four independent directors rejected the demand, and Mr. Molaris subsequently resigned, the company said.

The drums plug into the controller port of a GameCube and transmit your drumming and hand claps back to the game, aptly titled Donkey Konga. The point is to correctly respond to symbols on a television screen that cue the appropriate taps and claps to music.

2004-11-18,"Paid Notice: Deaths   YOUNG, ADAM","YOUNG--Adam, 91, died on November 15, 2004 of a stroke, at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, FL. He was a native of New York City. Adam Young, a page for the National Broadcasting Company while in his teens who then went on to co-found Young Broadcasting, Inc., one of the country's 25 largest television station groups. A broadcast pioneer who worked in both radio and television during their formative years, Mr. Young spent his entire professional life in the industry, having begun his career at NBC radio at the age of 17. The oldest of eight children, his income was needed to help support the family. During this time he also served as a page for the grand opening of Radio City Music Hall and was involved in NBC's move to its new Rockefeller Center headquarters. He eventually moved from the position of Head Page, through the Programming Department, and on to the Research and Promotion Department, where he developed a flair for mathematics which he successfully applied throughout his career. At night, Mr. Young managed the New Amsterdam Theater for NBC where many of the popular Big Bands of the era performed for live radio broadcasts. In 1936 he left NBC Radio and went into the advertising industry. Within eight years, he started his own business, Adam Young, Inc., representing radio stations in the United States, Canada and around the world. Eventually, with the development of a new broadcast technology, the focus of the Company shifted from representing radio stations to representing television stations. In 1986, Mr. Young co-founded Young Broadcasting Inc. with his son, Vincent, which began with the purchase of two television stations. Today the NASDAQ - traded company owns and operates 10 television stations across the United States. The Young Broadcasting station group includes ABC, CBS and NBC affiliates, as well as the nation's largest independent station--KRONTV in San Francisco. Mr. Young continued to be fully active in the business, and at the time of his death, he was the Treasurer of Young Broadcasting Inc., and President Emeritus of Adam Young Inc. In recognition of his achievement of starting with nothing and building successful radio and television businesses, Mr. Young received the Horatio Alger Association award in 1957. He was a founder of the Station Representative Association and went on to serve as President of the Association from 1955-1957. He served on the Board of Directors of the Television Bureau of Advertising from 1977-1980, and for many years he headed up its Research Committee. He was a board member of the Radio Advertising Bureau and also served as ViceChairman of the Standards Committee of the International Advertising Association. Mr. Young served as president of the Westhampton Country Club; and until recently, he was president of BioMotion Foundation, a medical research organization based in West Palm Beach, FL, dedicated to improving the technology of artificial joints. He was constantly selfeducating and he was also an avid painter. Mr. Young is survived by his wife of 68 years, Margaret Kelly Young, a daughter Sharon Conroy of Palm Beach, FL, a son Richard of Greenwich, CT and a son Vincent of Bedford, NY. A daughter, Susan Quinn, predeceased him. He also leaves nine grandchildren and two great grandchildren. There will be a viewing at Quattlebaum Funeral Home in West Palm Beach, FL on Thursday from 6:30 to 8:30 PM; and a service at the Royal Poinciana Chapel in Palm Beach on Friday at 11 AM.

2004-11-19,The Listings; ANIMAL COLLECTIVE,"Over the last few years, the musicians known as Avey Tare, above, and Panda Bear have emerged at the center of a scene that prides itself on not having one. The two are the most prominent members of Animal Collective, a loose-knit group made up of singers and noisemakers who are exploring a joyful -- and joyfully light-headed -- mutant strain of folk music. Earlier this year, Animal Collective released ""Sung Tongs"" (Fat Cat), a marvelous CD full of sing-along songs that sound instantly familiar but tantalizingly unrecognizable. Stray voices float by in the distance, guitarists strum energetic but asymmetrical rhythms, small choruses cohere around repeated phrases you can't quite translate. Every once in a while there's a buried joke: ""College"" is a 53-second song in which wordless harmonies give way to a bit of advice, as the singers intone, ""You don't have to go to college."" The Animal Collective empire is expanding. Panda Bear recently released his second solo album, a hushed elegy for his father called ""Young Prayer"" (Paw Tracks). And last month, the group's Paw Tracks record label released its first non-Animal CD, ""The Doldrums,"" by an oblique California singer-songwriter who calls himself Ariel Pink; he dumps dirt on his bruised and warped 70's-style rock ballads, then dares them to shine anyway. You won't be shocked to learn that Animal Collective's live shows can be enthralling or exasperating, depending upon your mood and theirs. But if everything goes pear-shaped, you can always stop by the merchandise table, grab a handful of CD's, go home and get lost. (Animal Collective: Sunday night at 8, with Gang Gang Dance and Oakley Hall; Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; tickets are $12. Ariel Pink: tomorrow night at 8, with Signer and Greg Davis, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; tickets are $10.)

In other encounters, in Rye and in nearby Greenwich, Conn., the man did not try to force children into the van, but the police called this latest incident an attempted abduction. The boy, who got away, told the police that the van approached him as he walked along Rye Road in the afternoon, and that a white woman with blond hair was driving. A white man with dark curly hair and yellowed teeth occupied the passenger seat, the boy said. The descriptions matched those of earlier incidents, including ones in Rye on Monday and Tuesday.

Ms. Rice, 50, plans to return home tomorrow and expects to be back at work on Monday, officials said. Uterine fibroids, which are most common among women 35 and older, usually require no treatment.

Benjamin Edwards, a painter having his second solo exhibition in New York, envisions the exciting and bewildering complexity of our brave new artificial paradise. Working like an unusually ambitious and ingenious architectural illustrator, Mr. Edwards creates expansive, kaleidoscopic fusions of Renaissance perspective, Cubism and Pop that measure as much as 11 1/2 feet across. As in ""Immersion,"" above, layered and intersecting architectural structures, streets and corporate logos spread out across the surface and recede into deep perspectival space. On one level the paintings convey feelings of utopian euphoria: the well-designed world is a supremely efficient machine for living; commodities, information, energy and money flow smoothly from place to place; peace and harmony reign. Behind that luminous scrim of beneficently rationalized order, however, lie shadows of anxiety and terror. Such perfection is a fascist's dream. The messy inefficiency of ordinary humanity is overcome. Corporate sterility extends as far as the eye can see. And we are left to wonder where, when and how the bottled- up energies of real life will next erupt. (Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through Dec. 30; free.)

2004-11-19,"In Savannah, Ga.","IN 1733, a Yamacraw Indian leader named Tomochichi agreed to the plans of James Oglethorpe, founder of the colony of Georgia, to create an agricultural settlement on the Savannah River. Oglethorpe set to work, laying out an unusual town based on an elaborate system of 24 public squares. Today the squares, shaded by live oaks and surrounded by stately houses, churches and the columned houses of government, define old Savannah, where shops and cafes occupy mansions and town houses, and tourists and locals stroll at a leisurely pace. Nearby is Bonaventure cemetery, where John Berendt, author of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" sipped martinis as his friend Mary Harty told tales of the departed. While Savannah's builders carelessly flattened a burial mound holding Tomochichi's ancestors, they set aside ample acreage for the city's own dead, and in those graveyards, beneath long gray beards of Spanish moss, restless spirits are said to walk. Most of Oglethorpe's city has passed on to the ghostly realm, too, but his urban-planning legacy remains: a walkable, bikable, town, one of the loveliest haunts in the South.

2004-11-19,The Listings; JENNIFER HOPE WILLS,"This is the woman who has been assigned the forbidding chore of making Brooke Shields look like the dog's dinner. In the triumphantly recast revival of ""Wonderful Town"" at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, Ms. Shields -- she of the high-fashion cheek bones and statuesque frame -- is playing the awkward, romantically unalluring Ruth Sherwood, who believes she would always be the loser in any beauty contest with her beloved younger sister, Eileen. Which is where a largely unknown actress named Jennifer Hope Wills steps in. Ms. Wills's previous Broadway experience has been limited to appearing in the ensemble of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" while understudying one of the title roles. (Guess which.) But without being obnoxious about it, she here exudes the natural confidence of a girl whose dance card was filled before she learned to walk. Her optimistic easiness turns out to be the ideal foil for the charmingly arch mannerisms of Ms. Shields's would-be sophisticate, just as Ms. Wills's lithe soprano melds in sweet sororal harmony with the older actress's straightforward alto. When this Eileen sings, ""mmmm . . . I'm a little bit in love,"" with the relaxed contentment of a cat in mid-stretch, it's unlikely that anyone in the audience doesn't feel the same about Ms. Wills. (This weekend's schedule: tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $51 to $101.)

2004-11-19,The Listings; MEREDITH MONK,"Meredith Monk has been sidling through New York dance for four decades now. An elusive creature, she has managed not to be categorized as the performer, choreographer, composer or filmmaker that she has been over her rich career. But her roots are in dance, or at least in performance art before it was known as such. No one has ever quite matched the intensity of the hyper-real dreamscapes she created from the mid-1960's on, using film, her own vocal music, movement and plain but shimmeringly evocative props to create pieces that existed on several levels of the everyday. A believer in total theater, Ms. Monk combined her dance group, The House, with a new Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble in 1978. And that seemed to open the floodgates of her prodigious imagination to pour out into film, opera and theatrical productions. Eventually she identified herself as a composer first and foremost. But dance is a persistent lover. If it couldn't have Ms. Monk, it could have her music, which has been a cool, eerie and bizarrely evocative staple of avant-gardish choreography ever since. This weekend, in ""Dance to Monk: Choreographers Celebrate the Music of Meredith Monk,"" six dance artists will pay tribute to Ms. Monk in her 40th anniversary season with new and repertory pieces set to scores that include her ""Dolmen Music,"" ""Volcano Songs"" and ""St. Petersburg Waltz."" They are Ann Carlson, Sean Curran, Molissa Fenley, the now rarely seen Dana Reitz, Doug Varone and Bill T. Jones (on film), all as fiercely individualistic as Ms. Monk. (Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., the Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $20 or TDF voucher.)

Half of those with such infections die within 18 months; most of the rest are severely brain-damaged.

2004-11-19,World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Native Groups Win Land Ruling,"In a decision that may complicate logging, mining and other natural resource projects, the Supreme Court of Canada said that governments must consult native groups before allowing major changes on land involved in ownership disputes. The decision came out of a case started by the Haida Indians after the province of British Columbia transferred a logging license covering about 25 percent of the Queen Charlotte Islands to the Weyerhaeuser Company of Federal Way, Wash. Those islands and the water surrounding them have been the focus of a century-old ownership claim by the Haida. Much of Canada's resource activity, like Weyerhaeuser's logging, takes place on land owned by provinces. In its unanimous decision, the court said that only governments, not users like Weyerhaeuser, must consult aboriginal groups. While it did not spell out the nature of those consultations, the court turned down a similar appeal yesterday by another native group in British Columbia opposed to the reopening of a mining road. In that case the court found that making the native group part of an environmental review was enough.

""Healthy debate and diverse opinion are being eliminated from the State Department and C.I.A., and the cabinet is being remade to rubber stamp policies that will undermine Social Security, balloon the deficit, avoid real reforms in health care and education, weaken homeland security and walk away from critical allies."" On the first day of the new Congress, he said, he will introduce a bill to provide health insurance to ""every child in America."" Suzy DeFrancis, a White House spokeswoman, declined to respond to the e-mail message's specifics.

And so it was, according to Nielsen's overnight ratings, that CBS's ""Survivor,"" ""CSI"" and ""Without a Trace"" each won in its time slot on Thursday, as each typically does. On ABC, ""Primetime Live"" got a bump from its usual number because of Diane Sawyer's interview with Prince Harry. Fox's trendsetting ""O.C."" dropped nearly a million viewers from its previous two episodes. After more than two weeks of sweeps, CBS is far ahead, which is no surprise. But no one could have predicted that the season-to-date ratings would have NBC, Fox and even the formerly underestimated ABC in such a close race for second place. Through last week's numbers, the three networks are separated by only three-tenths of a ratings point, and Fox is in the running only because of its successful weeks of postseason baseball. January cannot come quickly enough for Fox, as that will bring the return of last season's No. 1 show: ""American Idol.""

Kinsey, the sex researcher of the 1940's and 50's. According to a spokesman for Fox Searchlight, the station rejected the spot because of the content of the film and fear of viewer backlash. But Stella Giammasi, a spokeswoman for WNET, Channel 13, said: ""We turned down the spot because it was too commercial and too provocative."" She declined to elaborate on what ""too provocative"" meant. ""It was not because the movie is controversial,"" she said. ""We deal with controversial material every day."" The ad is the same one being shown on network and cable stations. KCET, the Los Angeles member station of PBS, will begin broadcasting the ad on Monday. Though public stations do not carry traditional ads, they broadcast ""enhanced underwriting spots,"" which do not explicitly sell products. WNET has broadcast such spots for movies in the past, including two dozen 30-second spots last summer for Fox Searchlight's ""Clearing,"" for which the station received $45,000, according to the studio spokesman.

The case had raised concern among provincial governments, which argued that paying for such treatment could cost hundreds of millions of dollars each year, overwhelming the public health care system and opening the door to lawsuits by people with a variety of disabilities. In its decision, the court said the treatment was not a core service guaranteed under Canadian law.

Mr. Seinfeld went to Washington on Thursday to deliver a piece of television history, the foppishly ruffled shirt he wore in episode 66 of ""Seinfeld."" In the show, Jerry unwittingly agrees to wear the shirt on the ""Today"" show and is told by Bryant Gumbel during their interview, ""You could be the first pirate comedian."" Mr. Seinfeld, 50, also gave the museum the script of the episode, called, fittingly, ""The Puffy Shirt,"" written by the show's co-creator, Larry David. The shirt will go on display on Wednesday in the exhibition ""Icons of Popular Culture,"" alongside Kermit the Frog and Dorothy's ruby slippers from ""The Wizard of Oz.""

As of yesterday morning, Mr. Murphy, a Republican, held a 2,749-vote margin over Ms. Frye, a Democrat, out of more than 310,000 certified ballots. But Ms. Frye and her supporters argue that several thousand votes clearly intended for her were discarded because the ballots were not properly filled out. A lawsuit filed by Frye supporters challenging the method county elections officials used to tally the votes will be heard on Monday.

2004-11-22,Inside the List,"VERSE, NO CHORUS: Thanks to Brad Pitt and the movie ""Troy,"" Reuters has reported, the best-selling poet in England this fall is Homer. In this country, that honor arguably goes to Billy Corgan, whose first book of poems, ""Blinking With Fists,"" has been bouncing happily around the Times extended list (available on the Web) for several weeks, rising as high as No. 24. People are not buying Billy Corgan's book because they are mistaking him for Billy Collins, the winsome former poet laureate. They are buying ""Blinking With Fists"" because Corgan, who led the influential band Smashing Pumpkins during the 1990's, still has a following -- he can seem like a geeky, gothy, brainiac version of Kurt Cobain. Corgan's free verse is the kind of stuff that, if you're skimming through looking for a line or two to ridicule, won't let you down (""I miss you already / Starting for home / The zombies keeping / All of it for themselves""). But at its best, ""Blinking With Fists"" is vivid and angular and not much worse than many first books of poems that arrive with heady praise from the poetry world's burghers. In ""Lost Gray,"" Corgan writes: ""Stir, the crow cackle / Collar high / The angles black against the sides / Splitting in 2's we swing clubs / Old fog rolls and hugs / Back slappin' / Paying dues for crackjaws."" I'm not sure I know what that means, but it beats the oracular utterances in Jim Morrison's poems.

The new three-year contract calls for a reduction in the number of full-time jobs, something the players had strenuously opposed in public, and a salary freeze for the first year. According to a statement by the orchestra, the number of permanent players and librarians will drop from 109 to 103 during the term of the contract, and then bounce back to 106 at the end of it. The orchestra stressed that there would be no reduction of forces on stage for concerts.Minimum weekly salaries will rise to $2,200 by the contract's end, compared with the current level of $2,000, which the orchestra said kept it competitive. The musicians will also be contributing more toward their health benefits and agreed to add more Sunday concerts. The contract is in line with those at other major American orchestras that have settled with musicians in recent weeks; a number have had some sort of wage freeze and higher health care costs for the members. The Chicago Symphony also had a temporary reduction in permanent positions. The Philadelphia contract is retroactive to Sept. 20, when the old pact expired. Negotiations were tense, and Mayor John F. Street stepped in to mediate. A tentative agreement was announced on Nov. 16, and the musicians and management worked out the details before the contract was ratified by the musicians this weekend.

Mr. Coleman was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for most of his life. An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ""Witchcraft"", ""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""Big Spender"", ""I've Got Your Number"", and ""Hey, Look Me Over"" to his credit. His Broadway scores included ""Sweet Charity"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Will Rogers Follies"", ""On the Twentieth Century"", ""I Love My Wife"" and ""The Life"", to name but a few. Cy Coleman was always at home at the Steinway, and to hear him play was a real joy and, for us, inspiring. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his generous and jaunty persona will be sorely missed by us all. To Shelby and Lilly Cye, we extend our love and our heartfeld condolences.

The Fellows of the Biotechnology Study Center, NYU School of Medicine, mourn the death on Friday, November 19th of Sir John Vane, D.Phil., FRS in Farnborough, Kent, UK. Sir John, a founding Fellow of our Center, was most recently founding director of the prestigious William Harvey Research Institute in London. He was perhaps the most distinguished pharmacologist of his day (1927-2004), receiving the Nobel Prize in 1982 for his work on prostaglandins. He discovered prostacyclin, a protective factor for blood vessels, and went on to show that aspirin-like drugs inhibit the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that form prostaglandins. By explaining how low doses of aspirin prevent clots, strokes and heart attacks, he made aspirin one of the most common drugs used to treat and prevent heart disease. Sir John's work also led to captopril, the first of a widely used family of medicines called ACE inhibitors. His discoveries may have saved more lives than any since the polio vaccine; they have revolutionized the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Sir John was a bubble in the lab, a scholar at heart, and a gentleman in the world of science. Colleagues and competitors will miss his wit as much as his wisdom.

We sadly mourn the death of our beloved husband, father and friend, who died on November 21, 2004, at the age of 73 after a long and valiant struggle with cancer. Paul will be remembered as warmhearted, generous and outgoing. He made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed in his presence. Until the latter stages of his illness, he enjoyed life to the fullest. Paul was co-owner of Paul Stuart, The Clothing Company, started by his father, Ralph Ostrove. The original store, which opened in 1938, was named after Paul when he was still a boy. Although Paul was formerly in charge of buying and clothing operations, he was best known as the heart and soul of the store. He had a friendly and unpretentious manner that endeared him to everyone. His customers, a great many of whom became personal friends, will sadly miss being greeted and hugged by ""the sweet guy at the top of the stairs."" He never forgot anyone's name or suit size, a remarkable talent given the multitude of people he knew. He began working at the store while he was in high school and always knew that he would go into the family business. After graduating from Colby College in 1953, Paul was in the Army for two years and then began his lifetime work at Paul Stuart. He was an overseer for Colby College from 1994 to 2003, an active member of the Lymphoma Research Foundation, and a member of the North Shore Country Club in Glen Cove, N.Y. Paul was an avid sportsman who especially loved golf, squash and skiing. He is survived by his beloved and devoted wife Estelle. They were about to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 3 weeks. He is also survived by his loving children and their spouses, Gail and Robert Kantor, who live in New York, Michael, who represents the third generation at Paul Stuart, and Lisa Ostrove, David and Lily Ostrove, who live in California, his eight wonderful grandchildren, Danielle, Jason, Zachary, Drew, Ryan, Daniel, Emma and Sophie, his sister Barbara Grodd, his brotherin-law and business partner of many years, Clifford Grodd, and several nieces and nephews. He will be terribly missed by everone who knew and loved him. He will be in our hearts and memories forever. A funeral service will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 81 St at Madison Ave on Wednesday, November 24th at 9:30AM. In lieu of flowers, donations in Paul's memory may be made to the Lymphoma Reserch Foundation, 111 Broadway, 19th floor, New York, N.Y. 10006.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/classified/paid-notice-deaths-ostrove-paul-stuart.html

2004-11-23,"Arts, Briefly; More Berlin Building Blues","The ambitious $2 billion renovation of Berlin's historic Museum Island hit a stumbling block last week when an official panel recommended to Parliament that the government abandon plans for a new entrance building to the complex. A new building with restaurants, restrooms and a check room was designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, below, to lead visitors into the complex, on an island in the Spree River in the former Communist east side of the city. Dropping the project would save the cash-strapped federal government $170 million. The recommendation was rejected by the federal culture minister, Christina Weiss, who said the new entrance building was needed to accommodate visitors. ""Those who question the arrangement of visitor flows on Museum Island prevent the museums from entering the 21st century,"" she said in an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Museum Island, which was built in the 19th century and is famous for its Pergamon Altar from Turkey and the Ishtar Gate from Babylon, was badly damaged during World War II, and restoration began only after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Parliament is to vote on the fate of the entrance building in the next few months. KIRSTEN GRIESHABER",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/23/arts/arts-briefly-more-berlin-building-blues.html

But round-the-clock spraying has protected large agricultural lands in the south with no serious crop damage, according to the Agriculture Ministry.

Also troubling for Fox is the slide of ""Arrested Development"" since its premiere two weeks ago.

Its sitcoms ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" right, and ""Two and a Half Men"" were particularly dominant, with ""Two and a Half Men"" building on the audience of ""Raymond"" in both total viewers and the coveted 18-to-49 age group. On ABC, ""Monday Night Football"" did not benefit from news coverage of last week's ""Desperate Housewives"" publicity stunt -- its viewership was on the low end of average for the New England Patriots' victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. At 10 p.m., CBS's ""CSI: Miami"" reached 21.93 million viewers, making it, as usual, the most-watched program on Monday. During the same time period, the third and final installment of NBC's ""25 Million Dollar Hoax,"" in which a young woman fooled her family into thinking that she had won the lottery, attracted a much larger audience than its two previous episodes. Last Wednesday's episide of NBC's ""LAX,"" the airport drama starring Heather Locklear and Blair Underwood, was probably its last. The network chose not to order any more episodes of the hourlong show, which had been moved from its initial time slot on Monday at 10 p.m. to Wednesday at 8 p.m. Last week's show was the 10th of a 13-episode order.

Mr. Keller is the chef at the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., and at Per Se in New York. The stock is clear and delicate, tasting lightly of chicken and vegetables, so that it can perform as the base for a soup or pilaf, to be seasoned as the cook wishes. Simmer it with chicken legs or just reduce it slowly, and the flavor will intensify. It has none of the harsh, oversalted taste of some popular brands of canned stock and is more balanced than the fresh stock I bought at a fancy-food store.

2004-11-24,Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Boston Scientific Buys Exclusive Rights To Stent Drug,"Boston Scientific, which makes coronary stents coated with a drug called paclitaxel, said yesterday that it had acquired exclusive worldwide rights for such use of the drug from Angiotech Pharmaceuticals. Stents are metal cylinders, often coated with drugs, that are inserted into blood vessels to keep them from reclosing after doctors clean out obstructions. Angiotech, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, had licensed both Boston Scientific and privately held Cook Inc. to use paclitaxel in a variety of stents. After Cook dropped plans to develop a coronary stent to compete with Boston Scientific's best-selling Taxus, Angiotech paid it $25 million to clear the way for an exclusive license to Boston Scientific. Under the agreement announced yesterday, Boston Scientific will pay Angiotech $14 million for the right to sublicense paclitaxel in the coronary market and increase its Taxus royalty rate by one percentage point.

He was widely admired for his ethics and wise counseling. Although Dr. Gray did not work for HIP Health Plan, he kept a close working relationship with HIP and HIP benefited from his experience. He was an exceptional orthopedist associated with the Queens/Long Island Medical Group, where he was also a member of the Board of Directors, and the North Shore University Hospital at Forest Hills, where he was Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs and Chief of Staff. Perhaps the essential factor in celebrating the life of a physician, especially this physician, Dr. Arthur Gray, is to observe that his patients knew that he cared about them, and that so many of them thrived under his care. We extend our profound sympathy to his beloved wife, Sigrid, and to his daughters, Nichole and Heather, and other members of Dr. Gray's family. Anthony L. Watson, Chairman & CEO Daniel T.

2004-11-24,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Campaign Against Drunken Driving,"Most mayoral news conferences feature scores of reporters and several television cameras crammed into a room with the mayor, his staff and numerous V.I.P.'s. But yesterday, with little fanfare, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood with four women, unknown to most New Yorkers, in the parking lot at City Hall and quietly affixed a red ribbon to the antenna of the S.U.V. that ferries him about town. Children of three of the women were killed by drunken drivers, and the fourth woman's brother-in-law was killed by one. The ribbon is part of the Tie One On for Safety campaign of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, to get motorists to affix a red MADD ribbon to their cars as a visible pledge to drive safely. Mr. Bloomberg said, ""We are not going to tolerate drunk driving,"" and told the half dozen onlookers who stood in the windy lot that there was really little more he could say.

Devoted husband of Ramie Silbert, who is honorary president of the ATS Women's Division and a member of the national Board of Directors, Mr. Silbert was a brilliant attorney with the firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn, and shared his wife's decades-long devotion to the ATS, the Technion and Israel.

They are responsible for the Ramie and Gerald Silbert Molecular Bacteriology Research Facility, the Women's Division Ramie and Gerald Silbert VIP Lounge, and the Silbert Scholarship Fund. Through Mr. Silbert's efforts, the Rashi Foundation, of which he was a trustee and legal counsel, became a major Technion supporter, also at the Guardian level. In recognition of the couple's long-term, vital support, the Silberts were both awarded honorary Technion fellowships.

The Schindler who emerges in this latest account -- based on interviews with Holocaust survivors and newly discovered papers, including letters stored in a suitcase by a mistress -- is far more flawed than the one depicted in the movie and novel.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the untimely passing of its beloved friend, the renowned American composer and pianist Cy Coleman, on November 18, 2004 in New York City at the age of 75. Mr. Coleman was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for most of his life. An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ""Witchcraft"", ""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""Big Spender"", ""I've Got Your Number"", and ""Hey, Look Me Over"" to his credit. His Broadway scores included ""Sweet Charity"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Will Rogers Follies"", ""On the Twentieth Century"", ""I Love My Wife"" and ""The Life"", to name but a few. Cy Coleman was always at home at the Steinway, and to hear him play was a real joy and, for us, inspiring. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his generous and jaunty persona will be sorely missed by us all. To Shelby and Lily Cye, we extend our love and our heartfeld condolences.

Next month, United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, will have been under bankruptcy protection for two years. In the court filing, United attributed the move in part to the rise in jet fuel prices, saying it would spend $1 billion more than it expected for fuel in 2004 and $7 billion more than it planned through 2010. United also said it wanted to impose a temporary 4 percent pay cut on its workers, beginning in January.

The market encompasses a half-dozen major game developer companies and four service providers offering games to their subscribers. C.D.M.A. and G.S.M. networks register an average of 220,000 downloads a month, the researchers said. ""The growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models,"" Clint Wheelock, director of In-Stat/MDR's wireless research group, said yesterday.

""Crooked Rain Crooked Rain"" was acutely self-conscious, looking over its shoulder at a more polished album by a far more popular California band, the Eagles' ""Hotel California,"" but it also sounds unguarded in all its mixed emotions. The reissue is a double album that adds B-sides from singles, stray album tracks and a second CD of unreleased material that's surprisingly strong: rough demo versions and stray songs from 1993 and a live 1994 BBC performance that proclaimed, ""Gettin' cooler but I'm out of of the loop.""

2004-11-26,The Listings; VEGA STRING QUARTET,"Chamber music craves intimate spaces, its magic too often dissipating when the distances are large. That's not a problem at Bargemusic, where the concerts take place on a real converted barge moored in the East River. With seats for just 125, it is one of the smallest and most inviting places in New York to hear a string quartet outside of your own living room -- and the only concert hall that offers gently bobbing views of Lower Manhattan. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, the Vega String Quartet (above) performs two of the loveliest works of the chamber music literature: Beethoven's Quartet Opus 132, with its famously breathtaking slow movement, and Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, a sublime conversation among strings and solo clarinet (played by Ethan Sloane). The locally based Vega Quartet has roots in China, where three of the four players attended the Shanghai Conservatory. Advanced reports suggest a promising young ensemble prepared to give vigorous performances. The group's two concerts are prefaced with a recital tonight by a switch-hitting string player (violin and viola) and college freshman named David Aaron Carpenter. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35 to $40; students, $25.)

2004-11-26,World Briefing | Europe: Russia: Military Desertion Attempt Turns Deadly,"A soldier committed suicide after he and his twin brother tried to desert the military. The twin brothers, armed with automatic rifles, fled their garrison in Solnechnogorsk, north of Moscow, and settled in a cafe. The pair were discovered by two police officers whom they shot dead. They then intercepted a vehicle, fled to a house and took hostages. After a siege that lasted for several hours, one of the brothers shot himself. The other was captured by the police. The brothers came from the Chelyabinsk region in the Ural Mountains and had served one-and-a-half years of a two-year conscription. Erin E.

2004-11-26,"Holiday Albums; In a Wide Holiday Groove, From Sinatra to a Remixed 'Messiah'","""A LITTLE DARLIN' CHRISTMAS"" -- (Koch). Little Darlin' was the small Nashville label that gave the world Johnny Paycheck, through a series of phenomenally good singles and albums in the 1960's; there are still some surprises in its vaults. Most of this Christmas CD features the singer Bobby Helms (famous for his late-50's hit ""Fraulein""), working tepidly through standards like ""Silver Bells"" with good hard-country arrangements. But Paycheck's four tracks at the end, recorded in the 60's for a Christmas album that never panned out, are the pearls. In his songs about women and alcohol, Paycheck traded on a passive-aggressive mixture of contempt and shame; incredibly, he extends the same emotions to Christmas. ""If it's not too much trouble/please hurry home on the double/we prayed the same prayer the last 24 days,"" he sings in one song, while the steel guitars weep. ""The Santy Claus down at Sears/said those kids need that mom of theirs/and told them you'd be home by Christmas Day.""

The Polyphonic Spree contributes a typically light-headed (and mildly irritating) choral version of ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)""; this must be one of the only bands capable of making a Christmas chestnut sound more Christmasy. Ivy does an effective, faux-vintage ""Christmas Time Is Here,"" but the easy winner is Death Cab for Cutie's version of ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),"" with Ben Gibbard sighing lyrics that capture one of the most popular holiday spirits: self-pity.

What's louder than a lump of coal, and much, much shinier? Ms. Spears's new greatest-hits collection, featuring three unreleased songs and (if you buy the limited-edition version) a bonus disc of remixes, all housed in a gleaming silver cardboard case -- it's, um, her most reflective release so far. Listening to her hits all at once, you may be struck by the seductive severity of Ms. Spears's music: the beats are sharp as tines, the lyrics are filled with evocations of fear and control, the voice projects nothing you might mistake for warmth. Her current single is ""My Prerogative,"" produced by Bloodshy & Avant (who also produced ""Toxic""): while tabla drums flutter around her, Ms. Spears reduces the two-note chorus to a flat -- and very effective -- snarl. The same duo produced the two other entertaining new songs, ""I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)"" and ""Do Somethin'."" Most of the remixes cheerfully clatter along, but Jacques Lu Cont's eight-mint version of ""Breathe on Me"" slowly reveals a different, more hypnotic charm.

""Atizame el Fogón"" is hardcore salsa from 1982, rhythmically hard-punching, with three vocalists, including Gilberto Santa Rosa, who has since become the standard of quality in salsa singing; the other five reissues, including ""From the Depth of My Brain"" and ""El Rey del Ritmo,"" are recommended, too.

2004-11-26,The Listings; 'RAGHUBIR SINGH: RETROSPECTIVE',"The photographer Raghubir Singh (1942-1999) spent as much time in London, Paris and New York as he did in his native India. But India kept pulling him back: it was the primary subject of his extraordinary photographs, 45 of which from the 1960's through the 1990's make up this mini-retrospective. Although his early model was another great photographer of India, Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom he met in 1966, Singh struck out in his own direction by using color photography, disparaged at the time, rather than black and white. More than a dozen books followed, each focused on different parts of urban and rural India; the images in this show are drawn from them. The documentary-style vision that emerges is neither sugarcoated, nor abject, nor controllingly omniscient. As in ""Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu,"" above, India is seen from behind heads in a crowd, through reflections in car windows or pools of monsoon rain. People notice the camera and move on; they are in the middle of life, in a vast country that is, like every country, constantly changing and resisting change. If images of ultramodern corporate India are missing they would surely have found their way eventually into Singh's panoramic India picture: a cultural portrait in which unsentimental realism is a form of love.

This enthralling collection brings together 22 years worth of hits by Mr. Strait, along with a new song, ""I Hate Everything,"" which hit No. 1 on Billboard's country charts this fall. Over the years, Mr. Strait's producers made small changes to reflect the times (lots of reverb on the drums in the 1980's, for example), but Mr. Strait's own warm, slightly melancholy style barely changed, whether he was cracking gentle jokes about former lovers (""All My Ex's Live in Texas,"" 1987) or telling a mournful love story (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne,"" 1996). Mr. Strait often adds a subtle quaver or pause, echoing the emotions in the lyrics without quite acting them out -- this restraint, this disinclination to become a character, helps explain why he has lasted so long. Only one complaint: it seems the record company edited some of these songs to make them fit; that's no way treat a 51-hit wonder.

2004-11-26,In Phoenix,"PHOENIX is finally rising. For years, the city sulked in the shadow of sexier 'burbs like Scottsdale, but now it's enjoying a culture boom -- with a young, raw arts scene, well-cooked food and world-class spas. Despite the rumor that ""it's a dry heat,"" the weather is generally pleasant from October to April, and yes, it does rain. If so, ditch the outdoor activities and head to the Heard Museum where, for $7 admission, you can see an expansive collection of Indian art. (The museum shop is also the best place in town to buy gifts.) With a citywide light-rail system still years away, you'll need to rent a car to get around, but Phoenix is built on a grid, so even a first-time visitor won't have trouble navigating.

The Notekillers were a squally, no-vocals band from Philadelphia whose discography consisted solely of a single from 1980. Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, an early fan, arranged this CD retrospective, and it's astonishing. Full of unreleased recordings (otherwise it would be very short indeed), the disc captures the trio making a racket that's ferocious yet surprisingly sprightly. While the rhythm section churns furiously, David First peels off a series of scrambled guitar lines, precise even when he's improvising. His diagonal riffs are marvelously untraceable (Surf-rock? New-wave? Heavy metal? Free jazz? Serialism?), and somehow these dense compositions inevitably come out sounding like party music. It's clear this band ranked with any of New York's much-celebrated no-wave acts.

2004-11-26,The Listings; 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN',"White guys are all over the place on Broadway this fall. What's that? Nothing new? Perhaps true, but this fall they seem to be dominating the stages in unusually large numbers, whether it's the sweet middle-aged lovers at the center of the revival of ""La Cage aux Folles"" or the cadre of German bureaucrats surrounding Willy Brandt in Michael Frayn's ""Democracy."" And speaking of democracy, it's probably not necessary to look to the theater these days for angry white guys, but if you didn't get enough of them over the past, oh, 18 months or so, there are a dozen tearing up the stage at the American Airlines Theater these days. Indeed, the carefully contained ire parceled out in neat portions in ""Twelve Angry Men"" is oddly comforting after all the free-floating white-guy angst of recent months. It's actually soothing to watch the waves of aggression build and subside in Jury Room 2A (above from left, Kevin Geer, Tom Aldredge, Mark Blum, Peter Friedman and Boyd Gaines). Reginald Rose's schematic dramaturgy may be hopelessly square, but Scott Ellis's collectively superb cast softens its blunter edges. And how often do you get the chance to witness justice being done in a little over 90 minutes?

But he put more of himself into the music, which eventually became an obscure LP called ""World of Echo."" Like João Gilberto, he wanted to create a music that was so quiet and intimate it constructed its own highly sensitized fantasy world. Using bits of written melody and long rhythmic improvisations for his soft crooning, accompanied by his own percussively played, fuzzed-up and echoed-out cello, he made something deeply mysterious, original and beautiful. The reissue of the album comes with extra unreleased tracks, as well as a DVD containing films of Russell performing a few of its pieces.

2004-11-26,The Listings; MOE,"Even before Phish played its final concerts in August, Moe was eagerly positioning itself as a successor for the position of America's top jam band. That means an endless tour, though Moe is taking a month off the road after its two shows this weekend at Roseland. Formed in 1990 in Buffalo, Moe has been performing nationwide since the mid-1990's, playing long, freewheeling jams on songs that look back to the Band and the Allman Brothers and over their shoulders at the Dave Matthews Band. Moe had its moment on a major label, Sony, announcing itself with a 1996 single, ""Meat,"" that ran more than 46 minutes. But jam bands tend to focus on performing rather than making radio hits and selling huge numbers of albums, and Moe has since returned to an independent label, its own Fatboy. Moe has the typical strengths and weaknesses of jam bands. It's long on vamps and short on songs, with adequate vocals that are quickly overshadowed by nimble, exuberant instrumentals. Moe's gift is spinning plentiful music from a minimum of material. The pleasure of its songs has far less to do with their two-chord foundations than with the constant flux of the jams they lead to, with two-guitar dialogues and a beat that can evolve from a countryish bounce to driving Southern rock to gospel to funk. ""Just do the things that come to you/ And you""ll always be true,"" the band sings in ""Blue Eyed Son,"" and that's just what happens with Moe onstage. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224; tickets are $27.50.)

Before Robert Randolph became a regular on the jam-band circuit, the folklorists of Arhoolie Records went to churches to find performers in the tradition called sacred steel, which makes steel guitar the lead instrument in gospel songs. The sliding notes of lap steel and pedal steel guitars can sound like trombones, singers, bells or birdcalls as they make notes wriggle and chords hover in the air. As church music, sacred steel performances often include singers praising the Lord. But ""Sacred Steel Instrumentals,"" which sifts through Arhoolie's catalog, leaves the proselytizing to the strings. It's rangy and eloquent music, and players like Sonny Treadway, the Campbell Brothers, Aubrey Ghent and Mr. Randolph turn familiar songs -- ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee,"" ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" -- and lesser-known ones into jaunty performances that go skidding and whooping toward an affirmation of faith.

The album weaves minisuites of carols, jigs and reels. Piano often makes the arrangements sound like a parlor gathering, and the women add plenty of Celtic touches to familiar songs. It's a cozy album that becomes luminous whenever Heidi Talbot sings, in a voice that's both awestruck and tender.

On its first album, Santana showed more of its beginnings as a blues band than it would in later years, but the album set the template for a long career to follow: conga-driven instrumentals that surged behind the jabs and wails of Carlos Santana's guitar solos, like ""Jingo"" and ""Soul Sacrifice,"" and radio-ready songs about the perfidy of women like ""Evil Ways.""

That's the approach the New York City Opera is taking when it travels to Tokyo and Nagoya in May as part of the American cultural program at the 2005 World Exposition. On the bill is something Japanese, or close to it: ""Madama Butterfly,"" Puccini's tragic love story about an American naval officer and a former geisha. Although popular in Japan, ""Butterfly,"" whose Asianisms were largely a figment of Puccini's imagination, is an opera that American companies often shy away from performing there, said Matthew Price, an executive assistant to the company's artistic director, Paul Kellogg. The conductor will be Atsushi Yamada, a businessman turned musician who is the first Japanese conductor to perform with the company. Audiences looking for a traditionally Western grand operatic spectacle won't find it in Mark Lamos's pared-down production, which has aqua-toned stairs and translucent shoji screens framing the stage and a fleet of naval ships suspended in the air. ""Ours is a contemporary interpretation, more attuned to a spare and internal Japanese sensibility,"" Mr. Price said. ""At least we hope it will come across that way.""

2004-11-29,World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Unemployment Falls To 23-Month Low,"The unemployment rate fell in October to its lowest level since December 2002 as the country's recovery continued to trickle down to the labor market, the government said. The jobless rate dropped in October to a lower-than-expected 10.5 percent from 10.9 percent the previous month. The number of unemployed people searching for jobs in the six metropolitan areas surveyed fell 4.1 percent, to 2.3 million, in part because of steep drops in the jobless rate in cities like Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. But real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, also fell in October from the previous month, slipping 1.2 percent to an average of 900.20 reais, or about $328.50 a month.

2004-11-29,Lunch Box Outside the Box,"From the moment a child is born -- and sometimes for months before -- the things start to accumulate. Shortly thereafter the things begin to break, or to wear down, or to grate on the nerves, or to require new batteries of nonstandard size. So much of the gear children require seems designed to frustrate. Why can't a car seat be installed without a 45-minute consultation with an instruction booklet? Why do the seams of a lunch box resist cleaning? Why can't a school notebook be both durable and light? When well-designed items come to market, they are swept off the shelves; such is the hunger for something that works. The BabyBjorn carrier, for example, an elegant, simply-stitched, cotton contrivance, revolutionized the way parents travel with their children, combining mobility with cuddling. A smaller version of JanSport's hugely popular backpack gave children a sense of independence and parents a free hand. It ought to be simple, so we asked a number of award-winning industrial, architectural and product designers to fix some of childhood's design flaws. While some of their creations incorporate fantasy, the designers have conformed to one fundamental maxim when designing for children: mixing fun with functionality.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/magazine/the-thoroughly-designed-american-childhood-lunch-box-outside-the.html

Benasillo, the president of Studio D, a company in New York that designs and manufactures logos and signs for retail stores, had just attended a talk by McKee, a partner at the Geppetto Group, a New York marketing firm. McKee had discussed the appeal of fictional characters like Harry Potter and, more broadly, how kid culture had saturated consumer society to the extent that it was becoming the central creative marketing force of our era. This is indeed what McKee usually talks about. He says things like ""The lifestyle of kids for the first time in history is something we study."" Or ""Kid culture has become the most intriguing kind of culture around."" In conversation, he tends to pile up the ideas before you, drawing on children's music or comics or (most often) the films of Pixar -- ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles"" -- as examples of the intermingling of kid and adult cultures, a phenomenon that to him suggests children are becoming far more sophisticated about products and entertainment at the same time as adults (he calls them kidults) are increasingly reveling in youth-based content. ""Is it just that the kids want to be older,"" McKee asks, ""or is it that adults want to stay younger longer?"" When Benasillo heard McKee talk like this, he sought him out in Orlando and introduced himself. Then he told him what he had been working on.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/magazine/hey-mom-is-it-ok-if-these-guys-market-stuff-to-us.html

2004-11-29,Inside the List,"WOLFE HUNT: Tom Wolfe's new novel, ""I Am Charlotte Simmons,"" enters the fiction list this week at No. 3. It had to run a gantlet to get there; critics have blasted away as if the book were a varmint on literature's manicured front lawn. Wolfe, who is 74, says he is taking his reviews in stride. ""When you're my age, there's two ways to find out if you're still alive,"" he told The Boston Globe. ""One is to feel your pulse. The other is to see if you're having a fight with somebody."" Nearly all of Wolfe's 13 books have made the Times list, beginning with ""The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,"" which had a two-week ride in 1965. (Of his two previous novels, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities,"" published in 1987, made the list for 56 weeks, and ""A Man in Full,"" published in 1998, hung on for 19.) Wolfe may be taking some consolation in the fact that his occasional antagonist, John Updike, did not make the fiction list this fall with ""Villages,"" his elegiac 21st novel. Updike's fiction was once a regular presence on the Times list. Of his first 14 novels, only one -- ""Of the Farm"" (1965) -- did not land on this page. Since 1992, however, Updike has published seven novels and only one of them, ""In the Beauty of the Lilies"" (1996), made an appearance here.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2004-11-29,"Paid Notice: Deaths   CLARK, GEORGE JOHN ''JACK''","CLARK--George John ""Jack"" and LaJean Avery--Died on Wednesday, November 17, in an automobile accident a mile away from their home of 40 years in New Canaan, Connecticut. LaJean Avery was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, on July 23, 1923, and raised in Huron, South Dakota. After attending Carleton College, she worked for the State Department in Athens, Greece, as part of the postWorld War II Marshall Plan reconstruction of Europe. Jack Clark was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on January 18, 1925. After undergraduate work at Yale University and graduate work at Harvard, he went to work for the Greek government in Athens, where he met and married LaJean. Upon returning to the United States, the Clarks lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, Bethesda, Maryland and La Paz, Bolivia, while Jack worked for the International Monetary Fund. In 1964 he joined First National City Bank (now Citigroup) and the family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut. Jack spent 26 years at Citigroup, working in international finance and retiring as an Executive Vice President. LaJean earned her Masters in Special Education from Fairfield University and returned to work teaching special education and directing the special education department at the New Canaan High School for over a decade. Jack retired in 1990 and LaJean in 1991. During the last 14 years of their lives they spent a great deal of time with their children and grandchildren, traveling extensively around the country and the world, and enjoying gardening, swimming, birdwatching, fine dining, and other activities at their house in New Canaan. They are survived by their three children: Constance of Coral Springs, Florida; Catherine of Great Barrington, Massachusetts; and Christopher of Wayland, Massachusetts; and eight adoring grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the St. Michael's Lutheran Church in New Canaan on December 10.

2004-11-29,'All in the Dances',"IN 1987 I WENT TO LINCOLN CENTER TO WATCH New York City Ballet dance Concerto Barocco, a ballet by George Balanchine set to Bach's Two-Violin Concerto. I knew the music well, having played one of the solo parts in high school, but except for an isolated Nutcracker seen on a college trip to New York, Barocco (as dancers and regular balletgoers call it) was my first Balanchine ballet. Indeed, I hadn't seen very many ballets of any kind, nor was I much impressed with the ones I had seen. So far as I could tell, they consisted for the most part of thin women in white skirts pretending to be birds, fluttering through elaborately costumed pantomime shows whose quaint plots were too silly to take seriously. I didn't know a lot about Balanchine, but I'd just seen a TV documentary about him that led me to believe that his dances were different, so I decided to give Concerto Barocco a try, in much the same spirit of adventure that might have led another person to go to the Museum of Modern Art, or to a jazz club.

But no one would say that he looks, at first glance, like the next Ken Griffey Jr. or Roger Clemens. At 14, Tommy is 5-foot-6 and about 145 pounds. He is still a little soft-looking in the way that many mid-teenage boys are, but his hard work in the weight room has started to build muscle definition, and his mother has changed her way of cooking -- more lean meats and chicken, less starch and fat -- to complement his physical training. He is just an average runner at present, but a more supple body might help make him faster. One thing Tommy has no control over, of course, is his eventual height, but everyone with an interest in his baseball career is eagerly anticipating a pretty good growth spurt, and with some good reason, since his father is 6-foot-2. ""You can't put your finger on how big a kid's going to get,"" said Tommy's coach, Ken Bolek, ""but if he gets as big as his father, I think we'll all be very happy.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/magazine/constructing-a-teen-phenom.html

But what about the 45 million or so other people, on average, who were watching television? Here's another way of looking at the ratings for that week: instead of ranking the broadcast networks, we've ranked the media conglomerates that own them -- and nearly every other outlet on your TiVo grid. The easy winner, predictably, was Viacom, owner of CBS and UPN as well as the MTV cable networks.

2004-11-29,Bollywood Confidential,"While I appreciated Suketu Mehta's love letter to Bollywood and share his passion, I felt he was too rosy in his assessment of the relationship between Hindi film and Indian politics. In 2001, ""Gadar"" (""Revolt"") became a massive hit, far surpassing other films like ""Lagaan,"" with its secular viewpoint making it more palatable to Western viewers. ""Gadar"" tells the story of an Indian Sikh who, to save his kidnapped wife, rampages through Pakistan, leaving the dead bodies of more than a hundred Muslim bad guys in his wake. Since then, a wave of hyperviolent films, often with anti-Pakistani and anti-Muslim themes, have hit Indian cinemas. Seeing ""Gadar"" in a packed moviehouse in India, with hundreds of young men yelling with delight as the body count rose, was the most disturbing filmgoing experience of my life.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/opinion/bollywood-confidential-699284.html

But unlike those purely malevolent spirits, the Skeleton Man (or Death Kachina, as he is also known) performed a mixed blessing for the earliest humans by guiding them out of the underworld, where they were immortal, into the light of the ""glittering world"" and taught them not to be afraid of death. In his masterly reworking of this powerful myth, Hillerman creates a kachina for contemporary times -- a hermit who lives in a cave at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and dispenses diamonds (""the symbol of greed,"" according to one wary recipient) that can corrupt anyone who mistakes their cold glitter for true light.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/books/review/the-jewel-case.html

She was dumbfounded when Sheraton, a pioneer of the critics-in-disguise movement, donned a wig. They do things differently in Britain, where few newspapers have budgets large enough to enable a critic to eat twice in a restaurant, let alone scarf down the half-dozen test meals Sheraton might digest before praising or damning a single mouthful. In London, there's no need for disguises -- some papers even run photographs of their restaurant critics -- because a restaurant will rarely see those critics more than once.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/books/review/food-writing-restaurant-rows.html

But of all people, Watson perhaps should have seen it coming. The renowned behaviorist was also vice president of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and a spokesman for the idea, then novel, that marketing is not just about peddling products that people need; it's also about creating a society of consumers ever eager for more.

To boost its stock, the Met has assembled a starry cast -- the soprano Renée Fleming, the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, the countertenors David Daniels and Bejun Mehta, the tenor Kobie van Rensburg and the bass John Relyea -- most of them singing their roles for the first time. It has also brought in an exciting director, Stephen Wadsworth, and conductor, Harry Bicket, who worked together on ""La Clemenza di Tito"" at the New York City Opera in 2000, both in their Met debuts.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/arts/music/four-ways-of-looking-at-rodelinda.html

2004-11-29,'Gilead': Acts of Devotion," TO bloom only every 20 years would make, you would think, for anxious or vainglorious flowerings. But Marilynne Robinson, whose last (and first) novel, ''Housekeeping,'' appeared in 1981, seems to have the kind of sensibility that is sanguine about intermittence. It is a mind as religious as it is literary -- perhaps more religious than literary -- in which silence is itself a quality, and in which the space around words may be full of noises. A remarkable, deeply unfashionable book of essays, ''The Death of Adam'' (1998), in which Robinson passionately defended John Calvin and American Puritanism, among other topics, suggested that, far from suffering writer's block, Robinson was exploring thinker's flow: she was moving at her own speed, returning repeatedly to theological questions and using the essay to hold certain goods that, for one reason or another, had not yet found domicile in fictional form.

The prize, to be awarded on Wednesday, recognizes work in anthropology, philosophy, history and the study of religion, for which there are no Nobel prizes. Mr. Pelikan, 80, was the Sterling Professor of History at Yale, the highest academic honor there. His most acclaimed work, ""The Christian Tradition: A History and Development of Doctrine,"" helped to integrate the story of the Eastern Christian tradition into the overall history of Christianity.

His works, including ""Finitude and Culpability,"" ""Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation"" and ""Time and Narrative,"" contributed to the development of hermeneutics, the study of the interpretation of texts. The winners were selected by a five-member panel of scholars and will share the money. The award was conceived by James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, and financed by the philanthropist John W. Kluge, who gave the library $73 million in 2000 for library projects, including the prizes and a new scholar center.
