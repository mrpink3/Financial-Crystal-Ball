2013-03-01,China: German Journalists Say They Were Assaulted for Filming," A German television crew filming in a village near Beijing was assaulted on Wednesday by a group of men in four vehicles who tried to run the crew’s minivan off the road and then smashed its windshield with baseball bats, said one of the correspondents. No injuries were reported. One witness later told the journalists that at least one of the vehicles belonged to the local Communist Party chief. The German crew, working for the broadcaster ARD, said the episode took place in Sanhe, a city in Hebei Province, roughly 30 miles east of Beijing. The attackers rammed the minivan, forcing it to stop. Two men then smashed it with bats as two police officers stood by. After more officers arrived they led the journalists to a police station. The five journalists were questioned for 16 hours, said Christine Adelhardt, an ARD correspondent. A police officer later suggested that the attackers had been “offended” because the crew had filmed without permission.

The agreement was approved over the protests of Jewish leaders and some of the victims’ relatives. Nearly 19 years ago, a suicide bomber drove a van full of explosives into the headquarters of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association headquarters, killing 85 people and wounding about 300. An Argentine prosecutor has accused Hezbollah, the Lebanese group with ties to Iran and Syria, of carrying out the bombing and senior Iranian officials of planning and financing it. Iran has refused extradition requests for nine suspects. The agreement will allow Argentine prosecutors to interrogate suspects in Tehran. Iran’s Parliament is said to be examining the proposal.

2013-03-01,Ireland: Suspect in Terrorism Case Faces Extradition to U.S.," The United States government has petitioned the Irish High Court to extradite an Algerian man living in Ireland on terrorism charges relating to a plot to assassinate a Swedish artist, officials said Thursday. The United States alleges that the man, Ali Charaf Damache, planned to set up terrorist training camps and kill several Europeans, including a Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, whose sketch of the Prophet Muhammad’s head on a dog, published in 2007, had enraged the Islamic world. On Wednesday, Mr. Damache pleaded guilty in the Waterford Circuit Court to making a menacing phone call to an American peace activist, a charge for which he was arrested and detained in 2010. The judge sentenced him to time served and released him, but Mr. Damache was immediately rearrested on the American extradition warrant. Mr. Damache arrived in Ireland in 2000 and married an Irish woman in 2002. The relationship ended in 2008 and he then married an American citizen, Jamie Paulin Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez has pleaded guilty in the United States to charges of conspiring with Colleen LaRose, also known as Jihad Jane, to support and train terrorists.

This chaperon “was ineffectual,” Solomon recalled. “While I consistently found adults sympathetic, I didn’t see how they could fix the problem — and neither did they. It felt to me like the weather.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/books/review/up-front.html

2013-03-01,Invasions of Space,"Well into the 1990s, tens of thousands of Palestinians worked in Israel and thousands of Israelis headed to West Bank towns to shop and get their cars fixed. It was the era before proliferating barriers and checkpoints and Arab satellite stations. Palestinians watched Israeli television and understood Hebrew. If a Palestinian worker’s son was getting married, he might well invite an Israeli colleague or boss — and that Israeli might well attend. The relationships were in some sense colonial, hardly between equals. But they were real. Each side was forced to face the fact that on the other were human beings with legitimate concerns, not merely enemies to be feared and despised. There was a surprising, even poignant, intimacy to the conflict, something unimaginable today.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/books/review/the-wanting-by-michael-lavigne.html
2013-03-01,The Iran Syndrome,"There is much to be said for understanding how the Islamic Republic of Iran sees itself on the international stage. We make little sense of history, and less progress toward resolving our conflicts, when we demonize our adversary and ascribe to him dark motives and irrational thoughts. Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett, veterans of the State Department and the National Security Council, might have written a book that made a powerful case for empathy in foreign policy. They would have devoted much of it to illuminating Iran’s strategic interests and its view of history. They might have done so while observing, as they have elsewhere, that American policy must not be blinded by sentimentality about Iranian human rights and democratic aspirations — concerns, they could suggest, that have no place in the cold calculus of global strategy. Whatever we think of the Islamic Republic, the Leveretts might argue, it is the policy maker’s job to understand it as it is, not as he would like it to be.

2013-03-01,Custody Flight,"Fiction is all about experimental selves, so it’s not hard to see what drew Amity Gaige to the title character of her third novel, “Schroder.” In his grim urban youth, Erik Schroder picks up a summer camp brochure in his pediatrician’s office and is so smitten by the photographs of fearless, handsome boys leading an outdoorsy life that he concocts a fallen-aristocrat persona in order to apply for a scholarship. Rebranding himself as Eric Kennedy, he invents a personal history (in which he was born and raised in a small town “not far from Hyannis Port”) that does much more than get him into Camp Ossipee. It opens so many other social doors that he never really drops the pretense: he goes on to college, gets a job, marries and fathers a child, all as Eric Kennedy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/books/review/schroder-by-amity-gaige.html
2013-03-01,The Daily Round,"The personal essay has always been a stepchild of serious literature, seemingly formless, hard to classify. Lacking the tight construction of a short story or the narrative arc of a novel or memoir, such essays have given readers pleasure without winning cultural respect. Written in a minor key, they could be slight and superficial, but their drawbacks could also be strengths. The style of the first-person essay tends to be conversational, tentative — in tune with our postmodern skepticism about absolutes, the trust we place in multiple perspectives. Few writers have pursued this more resourcefully than Phillip Lopate, who started out as a novelist and poet but gained traction when he began writing lively first-person essays in the late 1970s, later editing a landmark anthology, “The Art of the Personal Essay” (1994).

He delivered this radio address in the belief that the actions of his government, thus far described only in the jargon of banking and law, “ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen.” He had three more chats that year, and two the following year. They played a crucial role in bringing the public with him as his government helped lead the economy out of the Great Depression.

2013-03-01,A Good Look at Herself,"“An Enlarged Heart” is a collection of personal essays written mostly over the past decade by the poet Cynthia Zarin. I assume the book is labeled a “personal history” for the same reason that collections of short stories are sometimes called “linked stories” or even “novels in stories,” which is that the reading public apparently prefers unified, book-length narratives to such hodgepodge. This is a superficial point, and the packaging decision was almost certainly out of Zarin’s hands, but I mention it up front for a couple of reasons.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/books/review/an-enlarged-heart-by-cynthia-zarin.html

The colossal effort Carr has exerted to produce his latest book, “The Legend of Broken,” weighs distressingly on each of the novel’s 734 pages, including nearly 80 pages of endnotes. This is a fantasy epic — the tale of a fabled Germanic kingdom that rose and fell during the Dark Ages — but with its convoluted prose, its trudging plot and its onslaught of unsurprising period detail, it’s a perverted one.

The women she usually writes about have a snide streak that Rosenfeld’s own sardonic tone amplifies, and the situations they face are less affirming than the books’ chick lit packaging would suggest. “What She Saw . . . ” (2000) reminds us that suburban girls from loving families can grow up to be lost and self-hating, and that being desirable to men isn’t a very satisfying end in itself. “Why She Went Home” (2004) explains that it isn’t easy to make it in New York City. “I’m So Happy for You” (2009) — didactically labeled “a novel about best friends” — points out that female friendship can be undermining and hateful.

Green, which contains notes of fig leaves and wet oakmoss, aims to capture their childhood memories of growing up on a southern Minnesota farm; Incense, a blend of peppery-sweet bergamot and burnt firewood, evokes the spicy-smoky aroma of the Romanesque cathedrals they would frequently pass while living in Lake Como, Italy; and Gardenia celebrates the exotic flora of Hawaii, where Annie resides. “I actually sent several gardenia flowers, tuberoses and pikake leis to our perfumers, and we ended up with an authentic gardenia scent that smells like my backyard,” she says.

The death of the boy, Max Alan Shatto, prompted outrage in Russia, which late last year banned adoptions by American citizens. Russian leaders had accused the boy’s adoptive mother of fatally beating him. Two Ector County officials — Sheriff Mark Donaldson and District Attorney Bobby Bland — said that after an autopsy, the medical examiner had ruled that Max’s death was accidental. They said that he had been treated for a behavioral disorder that caused him to injure himself and that the bruising that had been found on his body was consistent with the kind of self-injury associated with the disorder. The boy’s adoptive mother, Laura Shatto, told investigators that she had left Max and his brother playing outside unattended and returned to find Max lying on the ground, unresponsive. He died later that day at a hospital. The United States Embassy in Moscow called the boy’s death a tragedy, but added that Texas officials “worked diligently and professionally to examine the evidence concerning Max’s death.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/world/americas/death-of-russian-adoptee-was-accidental-texas-says.html

N.M.L. Capital, a subsidiary of the New York-based hedge fund Elliott Management, is leading a lawsuit among bondholders who refused Argentina’s 2005 and 2010 debt swaps. Ninety-three percent of creditors agreed to the restructuring in which debt stemming from Argentina’s $100 billion default was exchanged for new issues at 35 cents on the dollar. A judge ruled last fall in favor of creditors, saying that Argentina could not service only some of its debt, and that it had the “financial wherewithal” to pay in full. Speaking to Congress on Friday, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said Argentina would pay “these vulture funds” but only according to the same terms and conditions agreed upon for the other creditors.

Critics say the Chinese government is not doing enough to stem the illicit ivory trade, which has exploded in the five years since conservationists and governments agreed to a program of limited ivory sales intended to stifle poaching and revive a centuries-old handicraft. In the past year, more than 32,000 elephants have been illegally killed, according to the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife organization, and conservationists say the vast majority of ivory sold in China is of questionable origin.

And along comes a spider. “The latest post-atomic-age Spider-Man has been updated with a skateboard and a hoodie, but it’s unclear whom he speaks to (beyond Sony’s shareholders), and for what reason,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Garfield and Ms. Stone are by far the movie’s greatest assets and when they’re together on screen, they add warmth and a believable closeness to the industrial mix.” Still, “this ‘Spider-Man’ feels like one of those unnecessary software versions, more Spider-Man 1.5 than Spider-Man reborn,” she said. “Spider-Man’s ethos remains — with great power comes great responsibility — but these days you can’t see his superhero heart and soul for his branding.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-03-04,What’s on Sunday,"8 P.M. (History) THE BIBLE Mark Burnett, the reality television impresario, and his wife, the actress Roma Downey, tackle great biblical moments in this 10-hour mini-series, which Neil Genzlinger, writing in The New York Times, called “a rickety, often cheesy spectacle that is calculated to play well to a certain segment of the already enlisted choir but risks being ignored or scorned in other quarters.” Ms. Downey leads the cast, which also includes Diogo Morgaldo as Jesus, above center, being baptized by John (Daniel Percival). Alas, “Abraham, Moses, David, Daniel and the other great biblical figures aren’t really developed in a way that illuminates them or makes them linger in our minds,” Mr. Genzlinger said. “And those thinking that the ancient miracles might be better served by the special effects available in 2013 than they have been in previous versions should prepare for disappointment. The Red Sea parts no more convincingly here than it did for Charlton Heston in 1956.” (“All-Star Celebrity Apprentice,” of which Mr. Burnett is an executive producer, has its season premiere on NBC at 9.) “Vikings,” making its premiere at 10, fares somewhat better in Mr. Genzlinger’s opinion. It is “a mini-series about a band of professional pillagers with a disregard for human life and a relentless focus on gratifying material desires,” he wrote. “So it is somewhat surprising that it is also a refreshing study in restraint.” Created by Michael Hirst, whose previous projects include “Camelot,” on Starz, and “The Tudors,” on Showtime, “it has the same relatively high production values,” and “sometimes the cinematography is downright arresting,” he said. “But what really drives the series are the performances”; he cited in particular Travis Fimmel, Gabriel Byrne and Gustaf Skarsgard.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

The lyrics are in idiomatic American English, cradled by melodies with a comfortable lilt and by Ms. Steiner’s sweet, unfailingly precise lead vocals.

Worse still, as the Times’s Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported recently, banks in the state are profiting from the loans by allowing the Internet lenders to automatically withdraw payments from the borrower’s account, in some cases without his or her permission. When the borrowers — or their lenders — overdraw on the accounts, the banks get to collect fat overdraft fees. ",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/opinion/bleeding-the-borrower-dry.html

A Mauritanian news Web site, Sahara Media, which has close contacts with Abu Zeid’s group, cited an Islamist source as confirming that he had been killed in a French airstrike. But the same unnamed Islamist source denied reports of the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, another militant leader, who Chad’s military said had been killed by its soldiers in Mali last week. The source claimed that Mr. Belmokhtar was alive and operating to the southwest, close to the Malian town of Gao. France’s chief of the defense staff, Adm. Édouard Guillaud, told Europe 1 radio Monday morning that it was probable that Abu Zeid had been killed. “It is likely, but only likely,” he said. “We don’t have any certainty for the moment. It would be good news.” Abu Zeid is said to have abducted more than 20 Western hostages since 2008 for ransom, some of which went to Al Qaeda.

2013-03-05,What’s On Tuesday,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2010) Michael Nyqvist stars as a crusading Swedish journalist hired by a wealthy industrialist (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate the disappearance of his niece 40 years earlier. Noomi Rapace, above with Mr. Nyqvist, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery in this original Swedish film adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel, directed by Niels Arden Oplev. “Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that’s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don’t let her fully play.” Ms. Dargis added: “ ‘The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo’ was originally published as ‘Men Who Hate Women,’ which apparently wasn’t sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up, no matter how commonplace body art is, at least outside of Stockholm, and it plays down its overarching theme, which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of ‘girl’ for ‘women,’ a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salander’s slender back. It’s an attractive back in the movie, as is the tattoo adorning it, even if, like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes, the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

Mr. Sarkozy, 58, who narrowly lost his attempt at re-election in May, said that politics “bores him to death,” but that “sadly, there may come a moment when the question is no longer, ‘Do you want to?’ but, ‘Do you have a choice?’ ” He predicted a “social crisis” and a “financial crisis of an uncommon violence.” Mr. Sarkozy’s comments were greeted with pleasure by his supporters and derision by his critics.

Her latest venture with FEED Projects — her six-year-old company that sells utilitarian-chic, grain-sack-inspired bags and donates school meals to the world’s hungry children with each sale — is the FEED function bag, available now on the company’s Web site. It’s a messenger-like iteration of FEED’s familiar burlap theme, with a detachable shoulder strap, a faux suede bottom and an interior outfitted with pockets for today’s many gadgets. To promote it, Bush Lauren, who minored in photography in college, has shot portraits of a smattering of her many creative (and busy) friends, among them the photographer Henry Hargreaves (above), the Town and Country editor Amanda Hearst and Lehmann Maupin’s Carla Camacho, all pictured carrying the bag. “We wanted to show real people that I am inspired by, and how they function,” Bush Lauren says of the project, which can be viewed on FEED’s Web site. “Instead of hiring a photographer, I thought: I would love to do this.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/the-multi-tasker/

The deal did not work out in part because of Time Inc.’s concern about flagship titles Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, which Meredith had decided not to pursue. Time Warner found it made more economic sense to spin off all its titles rather than retain a few of them, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said.

2013-03-07,The Terror Loophole,"The law that requires background checks on gun buyers is full of loopholes, some big and some small, but the most egregious loophole of all may be the fact that people on the F.B.I.’s terrorist watch list are legally entitled to buy firearms and explosives. And they have been doing so at an alarming rate. Between February 2004 and December 2010, individuals whose names turned up on the list were cleared to purchase firearms or explosives a total of 1,321 times, according to the General Accounting Office. Felons, illegal immigrants and mentally ill applicants are barred on the obvious grounds that they could present a heightened risk of violence. Not so, terrorist suspects — an anomaly that congress has occasionally tsk-tsked over since the 9/11 atrocities, but done nothing substantial to repair.Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has reintroduced a worthy measure to close this “terror gap”— eight years after his initial attempt failed. It would give the Attorney General authority to stop a firearm or explosive sale when a background check reveals the buyer is a known or suspected terrorist who the Attorney General reasonably believes may be planning mayhem. The National Rifle Association opposed the measure in the past because the terrorist watch list has been shown to contain errors. That’s hardly a justification for extending carte blanche to terrorist suspects. Besides, the Lautenberg bill includes written guidelines and due process safeguards that would permit individuals to challenge denials. There’s really no good reason for inaction, unless of course fear of the gun lobby counts as an excuse.",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/the-terror-loophole/

2013-03-07,The Artist as Curator,"Born in Vietnam and raised in Denmark, the conceptualist Danh Vo’s rapid rise in the art world can be attributed to his incisive and enigmatic style. His most famous work to date involved “building” a to-scale model of the Statue of Liberty: the hundreds of discrete chunks were never actually assembled into a whole; instead they were scattered around the globe to represent the reach of democracy and American imperialism. Last year, Vo won the Guggenheim’s prestigious Hugo Boss Prize, a biennial award that comes with a solo show at the museum. Continuing his exploration of identity and heritage, Vo has filled his show, which opens on March 15, with artwork, kitschy Americana (above right) and Oriental knickknacks that belonged to the late painter Martin Wong. “I consider it a kind of collaboration,” he says. “And I don’t have any problems collaborating with dead people.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/the-artist-as-curator/

While lead singer Donald Cumming isn’t shying away from whatever halo effect that may cast on the Virgins‘ “Strike Gently,” which will be released March 12, mostly he’s excited to have the blessing of a fellow musician who understands both sides of the mixing board. “We all played the songs in the studio together,” Cumming said of the band. “You can really hear our instruments bleeding over each other.” The organic quality here lies in considerable contrast to the Virgins’ self-titled 2008 debut, whose rock ‘n’ roll was produced to within inches of bubble-gum pop on tracks like “Rich Girls” and “One Week of Danger.” Their new material is stripped down, a harmonic rumble of moonlight swagger and blue-rose tattoos. “I never aspired to hear someone sing my lyrics on ‘American Idol,'” Cumming explained. “I just wanted to make music that felt authentic to me.” Indeed, a lot has changed in the intervening five years: Cumming is the only original member left in the group; he’s married now, to the artist Aurel Schmidt; and he even taught himself to play the piano (think Schroeder from Peanuts, but with a Brechtian twist). “I don’t like to practice too much,” he admitted. “I like the discoveries I make to sound fresh.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/born-again-virgins/

When the Book Review returned on April 7 of that year, its front cover featured a cartoon of a despondent bearded man slumped in an armchair, his concerned wife soothing him: “Cheer up, Harry. You’re not the only author who came out during the strike.” And he wasn’t: the first quarter of 1963 saw the arrival of big books from Günter Grass (“The Tin Drum”), Betty Friedan (“The Feminine Mystique”), Anthony Burgess (“A Clockwork Orange”) and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (“One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich”), among many others. The Book Review did what it could to catch up — all four of those books received respectful reviews in the April 7 issue, and both “The Tin Drum” and “The Feminine Mystique” went on to become hardcover best sellers. But Burgess and Solzhenitsyn had to defer their gratification. “A Clockwork Orange” finally turned up on the paperback fiction list in 1972, after Stanley Kubrick had turned it into a hit movie. And Solzhenitsyn (like Grass) eventually won the Nobel Prize in Literature.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Before the novel even begins, Balliett offers dictionary definitions of the words “home,” “lost” and “time,” as well as a brief, sobering statement about the thousands of homeless children in Chicago. She also describes a 2003 diamond heist, at the time the biggest in history, in which the thieves were caught but the gems never found.

2013-03-08,Love Knots,"We don’t, in America, have any writers quite like the Scottish novelist A. L. Kennedy. Her nearest local relative, perhaps, is Richard Ford in his Bascombe novels, with that funny, dark, vituperative voice that serves equally well for tragic and comic moments. Ford, though, possesses an underlying conviction about continuity — of character, of place, of history — while in Kennedy’s world everything is up for grabs, all the time. One might view her work as surreal, if that didn’t imply a divorce from our own felt reality; one might call her sensibility ironic, except she’s profoundly attached to what she describes. Kennedy’s novels repeatedly take on dark subjects (alcoholism, familial despair, sexual betrayal, loneliness), but they do so in a chatty, engaging manner that can sometimes make you laugh out loud. I wasn’t surprised to learn that she has a sideline as a stand-up comic — though, again, this isn’t something a serious American novelist would do. And A. L. Kennedy is as serious as they get.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/books/review/the-blue-book-by-a-l-kennedy.html

Over the last several years, the event has catapulted small beer brewers like 32 Via dei Birrai into stardom. Buyers and foodies alike descend to see where the culinary barometer is tilting. The fair includes on-site chats and presentations, like this year’s colloquium about grandiose cake design led by the expert pastry chef Roberto Rinaldini of the famed Pasticceria Rinaldini di Rimini, and discussions about how to encourage your child’s inner foodie presented by Vogue Bambini. The event is held in Florence’s impressive Leopolda train station, but there are more than 100 supplementary food events all over the city at hotels, restaurants and cultural sites like the Gucci museum, where the house chef will be teaching the secrets of cookie-making.

Among the reasons: The pioneering use of ensemble star power (Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery and Joan Crawford), promoted by the MGM studio as “the greatest cast ever assembled.” And the words “I want to be alone,” the signature line of the fading, suicidal ballerina played by Garbo, which became synonymous with the mysterious image of the actress throughout her life. “Week-End at the Waldorf,” the 1945 “Grand Hotel” remake starring Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon, above, follows at 10.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

In preliminary materials furnished to The New York Times last month, Oliver Rathkolb, the lead historian, said he had learned, from a “highly trustworthy and well-informed witness,” the identity of a shadowy presence and promised to reveal it with the entire study. That has now been posted on the orchestra’s Web site, in German, with a promise of an English translation to follow. The person served as an emissary, official or not, of the orchestra in delivering a replacement of the orchestra’s ring of honor that had been bestowed on Baldur von Schirach in 1942. Schirach, the Nazi governor of Vienna who lost the ring after World War II, spent 20 years in prison for his part in deporting tens of thousands of Viennese Jews to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland. In late 1966 or early 1967, after he was freed, the replacement ring was tendered by — it is now revealed — Helmut Wobisch, a trumpeter in the orchestra. Wobisch joined the Nazi party and the SS early on, spied on and denounced fellow musicians, was fired by the orchestra after the war, rejoined it in 1947, became its executive director in 1953 and played in it until 1968.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/arts/music/historians-issue-report-on-vienna-philharmonic.html

The ruling Friday, by Judge A. Wallace Tashima of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, came in a lawsuit brought by teachers and students at the Tucson Unified School District against Arizona’s school superintendent, John Huppenthal, and other state officials. The plaintiffs say the law is too broad to be constitutional. The law, signed in 2010, prohibits public schools from offering courses that promote the overthrow of the United States government, advocate ethnic solidarity and foster resentment toward a race or class of people. In Tucson, students studied history and literature from a Mexican-American perspective. Opponents said the curriculum encouraged students to resent white people. Judge Tashima ruled, however, that banning classes tailored specifically to students of a particular ethnicity is unconstitutional.

(MoreMax) LOLA VERSUS (2012) After Lola (Greta Gerwig, above), a graduate student in New York, is dumped by her fiancé, Luke (Joel Kinnaman), as her 30th birthday approaches, she tries to pull her life together with the help of her best friends, the wacky Alice (Zoe Lister-Jones) and the sensitive Henry (Hamish Linklater). But somehow Luke can’t let go of Lola entirely, and she can’t help longing to get back together with him. Debra Winger and Bill Pullman play Lola’s mostly supportive parents. The film, directed by Daryl Wein from a script he wrote with Ms. Lister-Jones, who are a couple in real life, “very much wants to be a funny, affectionate portrait of a young woman in crisis,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Lola Versus,’ unfortunately, is a dismayingly conventional exploration of the vicissitudes of romance. In spite of its scruffy look and slack pacing, it often rings as false as any of the big, shiny and soft studio rom-coms (starring Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl, say) of the last decade.” Lola, he added, “deserves better.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

No doubt experiences correlate with objective physical facts, but, as subjective phenomena, how could they be such facts?

2013-03-13,Venezuela: Panel Will Investigate Roots of Cancer That Killed Chávez,"Venezuela will create a scientific panel to investigate the illness of Hugo Chávez, after an accusation by the interim president last week that the former president’s cancer was mysteriously caused by his enemies. “We have this intuition that our Commander Chávez was poisoned by dark forces that wanted to get rid of him to destroy the Bolivarian revolution and strike at Latin America and the Caribbean,” Nicolás Maduro, the interim president, said Monday night. Mr. Chávez, a charismatic leftist, died last week after 14 years in office. The government has refused to say what type of cancer Mr. Chávez had, but Mr. Maduro said that it had behaved in a very unusual way. Mr. Maduro said that the United States and other countries had developed programs in the 1940s and 1950s to experiment with intentionally causing cancer, but he added, “I’m not accusing the United States at this moment.” He did not say when the scientific panel would be created or who would be on it.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/world/americas/venezuela-panel-will-investigate-roots-of-cancer-that-killed-chavez.html
2013-03-13,Mali: France Will Seek U.N. Force to Replace French-Led Coalition," France has told fellow United Nations Security Council members it intends to introduce a resolution this month that would authorize a peacekeeping force in Mali to replace the current contingents of African and French soldiers deployed in that country, diplomats said Tuesday. France, which has said publicly it wants to scale down its forces in Mali, plans to schedule a vote on such a resolution in April, with the goal of transferring peacekeeping responsibilities by July, the diplomats said. French forces intervened two months ago in Mali, a former French colony, to stop Islamist militants occupying the northern part of the country from expanding into the south. Since then, a combination of soldiers from France, Mali and neighboring African countries has helped drive the militants out of northern Malian cities deep into the hinterlands, but they remain a threat. The exact size of a United Nations peacekeeping force for Mali has yet to be determined, but France’s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, was quoted by Agence France-Presse as telling lawmakers in Paris it could be as many as 10,000 soldiers.

It is very rarely a festival where the polished pop star bestows a slick, remote performance on distant fans and then disappears back behind the veil of celebrity. The clubs where most gigs take place are too small and the stages are too low for that; audience members are close enough to see musicians eye to eye. They can probably run into them backstage, too, loading their own equipment into the van. Even at larger places, the stars don’t get to bring their custom-built stages, lights and sound systems; they play in the existing setups, like the big, bumpy backyard of a barbecue place or a generic temporary stage in a warehouse or a vacant lot. Performers also experience the same Texas weather — summery even in March — that audiences do.

2013-03-14,Out of Time: The Sins of Immediacy,"“Present Shock” is one of those invaluable books that make sense of what we already half-know. Playing on the title of Alvin Toffler’s influential 1970 “Future Shock,” which sounded an alarm about what Mr. Toffler called “a personal perception of too much change in too short a period of time,” Douglas Rushkoff analyzes a very different phenomenon. The future arrived a little while ago, he posits — maybe with Y2K, maybe with Sept. 11. Now it’s here. And we are stuck with “a diminishment of everything that isn’t happening right now — and the onslaught of everything that supposedly is.” Mr. Toffler warned that we would be unready for this onslaught. Mr. Rushkoff is more analytical than alarmist. He divides his thoughts into five sections addressing five kinds of profound change, and his biggest illustration of present shock has to do with the actual book itself. Because the present is more full of interruptions than the past was, it took him extra time to write. Because its ideas aren’t glib, he says, “here I am writing opera when the people are listening to singles.” And he realizes that data-swamped readers may take longer to finish books now. Coming from him the phrase “thanks for your time” has new meaning.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/books/present-shock-by-douglas-rushkoff.html

2013-03-14,A Creative Turn for Watering,"Paul Loebach, a Brooklyn-based industrial designer, has produced furniture, accessories, lighting and even wallpaper, but says that his latest creation, the X3 watering can for Kontextür, beats them all. Like much of Mr. Loebach’s work, the can, which won the award for product-design excellence at the Accent on Design show in January, celebrates a vintage industrial aesthetic while looking new. It gets its name from a trick in its construction: a single metal tube is bent three times to create the handle and spout, then soldered onto the body. The X3 will be available in late April in solid copper ($99.95) and in white-, green-, blue- or red-painted steel ($49.95).

Tourism — which has accounted for 11 percent of Egypt’s gross domestic product, economists say — has suffered more than any other industry from the street protests and political turmoil that have prevailed since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak two years ago. The report, released by the nonprofit World Economic Forum and publicized around the world, is unlikely to help. A Tourism Ministry official said the results were not a surprise, given the turmoil and the survey’s methodology, which relied heavily on a survey of executives as well as statistics like traffic accidents. Both government and industry officials say, however, that there are signs of recovery, although mainly because of bargain-hunting Red Sea beachgoers, rather than the more profitable Sphinx-and-Pyramids circuit.

The monthly report, by the International Energy Agency, a 28-nation group of oil-importing nations, said Iran’s exports rose to 1.28 million barrels a day, from 1.13 million barrels a day in January, suggesting that the impact of the new sanctions was either negligible or had not yet begun to be felt. Under an American sanctions law provision that took effect on Feb. 6, any country that buys Iranian oil must put the purchase money into a local bank account. Iran cannot repatriate the money and can only use it to buy goods within that country. Violators of the provision risk severe penalties in doing business with the United States.

Carson is a private person. She prefers to be alone. (When her husband is traveling, Carson will call and tell him, “I miss you, but I’m having a great time.”) Her book jackets have no author photo. Her back-flap biography — “Anne Carson was born in Canada and teaches ancient Greek for a living” — is so minimalist that it sounds like a parody of a back-flap biography. Carson told me that, years ago, she had a bad experience with the private-detective model of journalism and would prefer never to do it again. It took her publisher a couple of weeks to wear her down to the point that she would agree, even in a limited way, to participate in a profile.

2013-03-14,36 Hours in Bangkok,"Bangkok has hit the sweet spot. It’s modern but far from antiseptic, filled with luxuries, pampering and great food — but still affordable. In the glare of the tropical sun it can be an ugly sprawl of tangled wires and broken pavement. Yet amid the chaos, visitors find charm and, above all, character. Somehow extremes coexist: skyscrapers and moldy tenements; high-end, cloth-napkin dining and tasty street food stalls; five-star hotels and fleabag guesthouses overflowing with backpackers; libidinous hedonism and Buddhist meditation. To travel across Bangkok is to see several worlds at once. Increasingly it is also convenient. The city of paralyzing traffic now has ample public transportation options ranging from boats to an expanding subway system. But if there is one reason visitors return again and again to Bangkok, it is the people. The anonymity and daily grind of urban life is slowly wearing away at the legendary Thai smile. Yet Bangkok remains one of the friendliest cities on the planet, still infused with the Thai village traditions of hospitality and graciousness.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/travel/36-hours-in-bangkok.html

Robert Bentley signed a law on Thursday granting tax credits to families who want to send their children to private schools or better-performing public schools. The act was passed amid heated controversy, not only about its substance, but about the way it was passed: A conference committee that was to reconcile versions of a school-related bill already passed by the House and Senate added the tax credit, and more than tripled the original bill’s length. The new version was then voted on quickly by both houses. Republican leaders said the maneuver was necessary for passage, but Democrats were left fuming. A circuit court initially blocked the bill from going forward out of the House, but the State Supreme Court lifted that hold on Wednesday. The legal fight is far from over, however, and even now at least one Republican legislator has raised questions about the bill’s passage.

Nowadays, major surf brands like Quiksilver and O’Neill have offices, shops and competitions in the area. But lately, a more indie surf-meets-art-meets-fashion scene has sprung up, as cool young Parisians settle into this grand old town overlooking the Atlantic. Their presence — not just in summer but increasingly year-round — has transformed Biarritz and its surrounding beach towns from what was once a resort for bourgeois retirees into a breezy bohemian outpost that has come to be called “the French California.” It’s sunnier, friendlier and more rough-hewn than much of France, tied by its hardy Basque roots to its Spanish neighbors just over the border.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/the-californication-of-biarritz/

The proliferation of letter volumes published over the past few years (Beckett, Bellow, Wodehouse, Gaddis, with Calvino and Wallace on the way) might be considered post-mortem in more ways than one, putting to bed a form that is already effectively dead, along with its authors. For while the ­e-­revolution means changes in how we read any sort of book, the move from epistles to ­e-­pistles is, for better or worse, a fundamental redefinition of the genre itself. And while there are probably plenty of contemporary writers saving up their best e-mails on external hard drives for later publication, it’s difficult to imagine those looking or acting like a volume of letters. Since you will read these collected e-mails on your electronic device, there’s a fairly good chance they will look like, well, your in-box.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/books/review/here-and-now-by-paul-auster-and-j-m-coetzee.html

In their complaint, the litigants claimed they would not have purchased Armstrong’s autobiographies “It’s Not About the Bike” (2000) and “Every Second Counts” (2003) had they known that the books were built on a foundation of lies. Any inspirational messages contained within, they alleged, were communicated with a flagrant disregard for truth. Armstrong’s stories of training vigilantly and succeeding as a result grossly misrepresented actual circumstance. Moreover, the lawsuit suggested, the two books were categorically dishonest: they were marketed as nonfiction when they were, it turns out, fictitious.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/books/review/true-lies.html

So it makes a poetic kind of sense that her memoir — the wincingly titled “Sum It Up,” written with Sally Jenkins — would shoot straight to the top in its first week on the hardcover nonfiction list.

You’ll always take yourself along.” The young man, convinced that his family’s summer home on the coast of Massachusetts is the only place he has ever been happy, instantly bristles. “Ashaunt,” Charlie insists, isn’t “somewhere else.” By now, having occupied this windswept spit of land along with the Porters from World War II through Vietnam, Graver’s readers will be inclined to agree. It is indeed special, sometimes almost magical. But we also realize, having come to know the other lives entangled with Charlie’s, that Ashaunt’s spell can involve something much more complex than a dearly held childhood attachment, that a house like this, where “everyone could be together and so tight,” can also feel “vise tight, tight enough to blow a fuse.” The therapist may be right. Wherever they go, Graver’s characters will carry Ashaunt along, but its look and feel will be different for each of them, colored by the emotions they inhabit just as intimately as they do its drafty rooms and sandy footpaths.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/books/review/the-end-of-the-point-by-elizabeth-graver.html
2013-03-15,Jump-Cuts,"There was a time when her name would provoke admiration, anger and, not infrequently, fear. Renata Adler was a purveyor of definitive judgments, of arguments that seemed to march inexorably from a firmly held point of view. In the late ’60s, during a 14-month stint as a film critic for The New York Times, she eviscerated a good deal of what Hollywood had to offer. (Her loathing for John Wayne’s hyper-­patriotic “Green Berets” — “so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail” — was entered into the Congressional Record by Strom Thurmond, who cited it as definitive proof “that this must be one of the most admirable movies of our generation.”) In 1980, she wrote an 8,000-word essay in The New York Review of Books that denounced the work of Pauline Kael as “piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless.” Throughout it all, she was a writer for The New Yorker, and her memoir of nearly 30 years there was similarly unsparing, showing that her category of “old friend” wasn’t necessarily distinct from that of “fair game.” She seemed dissatisfied with merely cutting something down to size; whatever offended her had to be put out of its miserable existence, and she wielded her hatchet with methodical and merciless strokes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/books/review/speedboat-and-pitch-dark-by-renata-adler.html

Bemoaning the decline of the written hand smacks of fogyism, but the British novelist Philip Hensher, who is also a columnist for The Independent and an arts critic for The Spectator, enlivens his musings about penmanship’s demise with sharp insights and wry wit. In “The Missing Ink,” he argues that handwriting fills a human need: “It involves us in a relationship with the written word which is sensuous, immediate and individual.

Brenda Fricker, who also won an Oscar, and Ray McAnally play Christy’s parents; Ruth McCabe (above, with Mr. Day-Lewis) is the young woman he falls in love with and eventually marries; and Fiona Shaw is the doctor who largely facilitates his education in what Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, called “an intelligent, beautifully acted adaptation” of Mr. Brown’s first book, directed by Jim Sheridan. But “though ‘My Left Foot’ is blunt and tough in its presentation of Christy’s handicaps, it avoids any direct criticism of the handicapped world into which he is born, one in which his mother spends most of her time being pregnant, in which poverty is as likely to make the spirit ugly as beautiful, and in which the church always has the last word.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

Rendell, a former Democratic governor, who joined with a fellow Democrat, George Leader, and two Republicans, Tom Ridge and Dick Thornburgh, in the unusual bipartisan appeal. Last month, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice, Joan Orie Melvin, was convicted on campaign corruption charges. Only six states select all judges in partisan elections, according to Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, which wants the governor to fill the state’s three appellate benches.

Anna McDonald, a representative of Oxfam, which is pushing for strong treaty, said her group wanted strict and specific language that would regulate ammunition. Thomas Mason, a representative of the World Forum on Shooting Activities, a group that represents firearms makers and users, said the sheer volume of ammunition produced made such monitoring impractical.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/world/negotiators-for-arms-trade-treaty-discuss-regulation-of-ammunition.html

He has run across entire landmasses­ (Corsica) and mountain ranges (the Pyrenees), nearly without pause. He regularly runs all day eating only wild berries and drinking only from streams. On summer mornings he will set off from his apartment door at the foot of Mont Blanc and run nearly two and a half vertical miles up to Europe’s roof — over cracked glaciers, past Gore-Tex’d climbers, into the thin air at 15,781 feet — and back home again in less than seven hours, a trip that mountaineers can spend days to complete. A few years ago Jornet ran the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail and stopped just twice to sleep on the ground for a total of about 90 minutes. In the middle of the night he took a wrong turn, which added perhaps six miles to his run.

To deter the act, Chinese officials are trying to prosecute people associated with those who commit self-immolation. Tibetans opposed to Chinese rule say those who self-immolated did it out of frustration with Chinese policies.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/world/asia/3-tibetans-sentenced-in-immolation-cases.html

For those who considered the shop a trove of ready-made inspiration, the news that it will close at the end of the month comes as a huge shock. “The Charing Cross Road area of London has changed from a haven for small shops to an area for mainstream brands and fashion,” the store’s manager Tim Matthews wrote in an e-mail. “Beyond that, though, image resources are increasingly found online and Dover Publications are moving steadily into that world.” Among the brilliant, obscure volumes that made up the shop’s stock in trade were Gustave Doré’s illustrations of London; Jan Vredeman De Vries’s book of 16th-century architectural engravings, “Studies in Perspective”; and Jim Harner’s collection of 1,000 black-and-white animal drawings.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/endnotes-the-dover-bookshop/

There is the Warholian logic to the iTunes chart: the artist who appropriates a particular time period with the most cunning and skill feels the freshest. The Los Angeles-based musical duo Rhye have received critical acclaim recently for evoking the early-‘80s-era “quiet storm” of Sade. Azealia Banks channels the 1990s with her best Crystal Waters imitation with about the same success as Lady Gaga’s echoing of Blond Ambition-era Madonna. (Remember that?) The moody atmosphere of Drake’s oeuvre picks up the pieces that Aaliyah left behind in 2001. And the dance-pop white noise that inhabits the radio today is, of course, a rehash of the Euro-pop and rave culture of yesteryear that Daft Punk helped foster. The French D.J. duo, who recently signed to Columbia and have a new album coming out in time for summer, are said to be working with the funk legend Niles Rodgers for their anticipated new release, situating themselves comfortably in the 1970s disco revival moment that has become a staple of underground night-life culture in Paris, London and New York.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/justin-timberlake-keeps-it-retro/

She called it “Mountains and Sea,” and it became her best-known, most influential work. Its bounding scale, skirmish of pastel colors and charcoal lines, and mixture of landscape, still life and abstraction were distinctive. But most important was the way it fused color and canvas into a new, streamlined unity. Frankenthaler’s stain painting method, as it was sometimes called, was considered a breakthrough in many circles, the gateway to what would become Color Field abstraction.

2013-03-22,Late Marriage and Its Consequences,"On Wednesday I had the privilege of joining a Brookings Institution event organized around the new report “Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage,” which tries to tease out the social implications of the steadily rising age of first marriage — now at 27 for women and 29 for men, both historic highs. Not surprisingly, a lot of the discussion focused on the impact of this trend on children, because the story of late marriage is entangled with the story of rising out-of-wedlock births, thanks to what the authors call “the great crossover” — the fact that the age of first marriage, which was once about a year earlier than the average age at which the first child was born, now lags the average age of first birth by about a year. Hence the report’s most attention-grabbing statistic: That 48 percent of overall first births, and 58 percent of first births to what the report calls “Middle Americans” — women with a high school diploma and maybe some college, but no 4-year degree — now take place outside of marriage, a trend whose negative consequences for children probably don’t need to be rehearsed here.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/late-marriage-and-its-consequences/

Apart from the unfamiliarity of the names on the title pages, not much united these works. There were novels, story collections, memoirs of food and art and unimaginable suffering. Their authors represented a range of backgrounds and sensibilities. And “new” didn’t necessarily mean “young” — youth (or age, for that matter) being no indicator of talent. But all the voices were fresh, and all made us sit up a bit straighter before settling in for the journey.

Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook, and her book has renewed longstanding debates about the paucity of female executives and the best way to remedy it. (Sandberg’s answer, boiled down, is: “Work harder, girls!”) One sign that the book has touched a nerve is that, along with a steady stream of praise, it is also fielding criticism from across the ideological spectrum. On the one hand, in the “biology is destiny” camp, Christina Hoff Sommers recently charged in The Atlantic that Sandberg was “mired in 1970s-style feminism” with her earnest calls for “consciousness-raising groups” and her desire to “liberate her fellow Americans from the stereotypes of gender.” What if those stereotypes are innate, Sommers wondered, and women just aren’t interested in high-powered careers? “In the pursuit of happiness,” she wrote, “men and women often take different paths.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/books/review/inside-the-list.html

It’s one of the strongest (and funniest) in the collection, no small feat in our zombie-saturated cultural landscape. It also, in its way, sums up the central struggle of many of Gonzales’s characters: When does one just sit by, and when do darker impulses bubble up and take over? When do we stand aside, and when do we act? These stories vary widely — an elegiac description of a plane circling Dallas for decades, a futuristic wake mourning the loss of Africa into the ocean, social science “reportage” about false anthropological claims — but they work best when the characters, for whatever reasons, succumb to a buried darkness.

Gavin’s characters, most of whom live in down-at-the-heels neighborhoods of Los Angeles or in modest industrial towns south of the city, are sons of journeymen, low-paid assistants and traveling salesmen. These men know, or are beginning to suspect, that the mark they will make on the world is small. But “Middle Men” doesn’t wallow in pessimism; with deft portraiture, nimble prose and an intimacy with the lives of his amiable characters, Gavin shows us that the real work of a life takes place not when the sale is made but when the salesman goes back home, looks in a half-empty refrigerator and considers his options.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/books/review/middle-men-stories-by-jim-gavin.html

Swarthout decided to tag along so that he could observe the rituals (pool-hopping, pith helmets, beatnik jazz) and capture the lingo (“beaucoup beers,” “schizoid,” “babyroo”). Upon his return, he dashed off a novel about coeds who cruise the beach and “play house” with boys from other colleges — a 1950s version of “Girls Gone Wild.” In a nod to the Easter season, he called his book “Unholy Spring,” but Hollywood executives persuaded him to change the title to “Where the Boys Are.” The result was a blockbuster book that was spun off into a movie — marketed with the phrase “spring vacation” — as well as a Connie Francis song.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/who-made-spring-break.html

(Starz) SPARKLE (2012) Whitney Houston, above, who died before this film was released, portrays Emma, a performer turned prim church lady in late-1960s Detroit in this remake of the 1976 movie starring Irene Cara and Lonette McKee, with a score by Curtis Mayfield. The “American Idol” winner Jordin Sparks plays Sparkle, Emma’s youngest daughter, who breaks free from the ranks of the girl group she has formed with her sisters (Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter) and ascends to stardom against her mother’s wishes. “Houston dominates the new ‘Sparkle’ and gives its most compelling vocal performance in her rendition of ‘His Eye Is on the Sparrow,’ ” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “Her vocal stamina was considerably diminished by the time she filmed the movie, but her disciplined, slightly hoarse rendition of that gospel standard gives ‘Sparkle’ much of its heart.” He added: “If the new songs on the soundtrack are effective Motown pastiches, most of them pale beside their prototypes.

Seddon. Normally, men fighting for the Confederacy wouldn’t have had to make such a trip, or had the temerity to do so. But Quantrill was no ordinary soldier. He made his request under the provisions of the Partisan Ranger Act, passed by the Confederate Congress in 1862 to organize and promote unconventional warfare along the western border. When Seddon asked Quantrill’s opinions about the war, Quantrill replied, in the florid rendering of the Confederate sympathizer John N. Edwards, one of his biographers, “I would wage such a war … as to make surrender forever impossible. I would cover the armies of the Confederacy all over with blood. … I would exterminate.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/another-name-for-death/

(HBO) PHIL SPECTOR (2013) A wigged-out Al Pacino reunites with the writer and director David Mamet (“Glengarry Glen Ross”) to portray the music producer and songwriter charged with the 2003 shooting death of Lana Clarkson inside his home in Alhambra, Calif. Helen Mirren, right with Mr. Pacino, plays the lawyer Linda Kenney Baden, who represented Mr. Spector alongside Bruce Cutler (Jeffrey Tambor) at his first trial, in 2007, which resulted in a hung jury. (He was convicted in 2009 and is serving 19 years to life.) The movie has already set off controversy: Mr. Spector’s wife, Rachelle, has complained about the film’s depiction of her husband as “a foul-mouthed megalomaniac.” Edward Lozzi, a former publicist for Ms. Clarkson, has taken exception to the film’s focus on the defense’s argument that she killed herself. The film is a work of fiction, Mr. Mamet said in an HBO interview, spun from his fascination with Mr. Spector’s character “and the mythological possibilities.” “The focus on the tender and respectful bond between lawyer and client looks a lot like a revisionist re-enactment and maybe even absolution,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “Everyone has a right to the best available defense, but not everyone deserves to be played by the best available actor.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

Mr. Murdoch has increased his lobbying efforts to revise a media ownership rule that prevents companies from owning both television stations and newspapers in the same local market (News Corporation owns KTTV and KCOP in the Los Angeles area). Mr. Murdoch has given mixed signals about his interest in The Los Angeles Times, which the Tribune Company plans to sell. The resignation last week of the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Julius Genachowski, could further slow the process.

2013-03-25,Now Showing | The Abraham Archives,"Though Paris was undisputedly the world capital of fashion in the immediate postwar period, one of its more important, if lesser-known, suburbs was Zurich, the home of the exclusive textile firm Abraham, which kept the couture houses of Christian Dior, Hubert de Givenchy, Cristóbal Balenciaga et al supplied with intricately printed, ultraluxurious Lyon silk. Abraham and its creative director, Gustave Zemsteg, who called on artist friends like Joan Miro and Marc Chagall to design prints, are the subjects of a new exhibition at Antwerp’s Mode Museum. Zemsteg’s most fruitful partnership was with his close friend Yves Saint Laurent, whom he met at the funeral of another client, Christian Dior. “I wouldn’t call their correspondence love letters, but they are certainly affectionate,” says the show’s curator, Karen Van Godtsenhoven. “It was a friendship as well as a business relationship.” Saint Laurent, then the newly appointed Dior heir, went on to use Abraham silk throughout his career; his last couture collection, in 2002, was the firm’s death knell. Faced with a dwindling market for its ultra-upscale fabrics, it closed its doors and donated its meticulous archive to the Swiss National Museum. “The bold flower prints, the fabrics with gold — what they did was incredibly opulent,” Van Godtsenhoven says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/now-showing-the-abraham-archives/

What made her fritters unusual was that she didn’t deep-fry them; rather, she used much less oil to sizzle them like pancakes.

The new judge, Denise J. Casper of Federal District Court, was assigned the case this month after an appeals court removed Judge Richard G. Stearns because his previous career as a federal prosecutor was found by a federal appeals court to feed the perception of bias in his handling of the case. Mr. Bulger faces a sweeping racketeering indictment that charges him with involvement in 19 murders.

Since the state legislature enacted the voucher program, about 9,000 families have taken advantage, and the vast majority are sending their children to parochial schools. Glenda Ritz, Indiana superintendent of public instruction, said she was disappointed in the court’s decision. “I personally believe that public dollars should go to public schools,” she said in a statement.

The fever is caused by inhaling a fungus that thrives in desert soil. The disease resembles flu or pneumonia. Though the illness is rarely fatal, more than 40 percent of known patients are hospitalized. From 1998 to 2011, cases went from 5 per 100,000 population in the region — Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah — to 43 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increase may be due to changing weather patterns or to excavation for new housing. Those who are often outside appear slightly more likely to get it, said Dr. Benjamin J. Park, the C.D.C.’s chief epidemiologist for fungal diseases, “but people who work in office buildings have gotten it, and there’s one case of someone who just passed through the Phoenix airport.” ",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/health/cases-of-fever-caused-by-fungus-rise.html

A portion is owned outright by my mother, who has entered into a contract with a natural-gas company to allow drilling on the property. Royalties from the gas extraction allow her to live comfortably in retirement. My mother made the arrangements for the gas drilling without my support. I’m not in favor of increasing fossil-fuel dependence. In light of the anticipated royalties, my mother was advised by her lawyer to establish a corporate partnership with my brother and me, for liability protection. This would mean a portion of the royalties will be mine. If I intend to work on any future climate-change projects professionally, should I decline the partnership with my mother? If I do not support natural-gas drilling, is that another reason to decline the partnership? And is this decision different from eventually inheriting money related to drilling?

The radio in my car was tuned to an NPR show, on which callers were debating the decision by the C.E.O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, to ban employees from working from home. I’d been thinking about Mayer since early that morning, having fallen down an Internet rabbit hole that plunged me deep into her art collection, her exclusive wardrobe and her estimated $300 million net worth. Specifically, I was thinking about the rather highhanded, Marie Antoinette-ish way in which she dismissed the need for extended maternity leave, as if it hadn’t occurred to her that building an en suite nursery for her newborn next to her office basically elided the need for it, since the baby could remain within a few feet of her all day long.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/a-modest-proposal-for-more-back-stabbing-in-preschool.html

On the radio it was all boy bands and Britney Spears, and there hadn’t been a vital rock scene since punk in the 1970s. But on a Sunday night at a tiny club in Lower Manhattan, something was happening. There were four acts on the bill at the Mercury Lounge; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the openers, and it was still light out when they took the stage. The band was elemental: guitar and drums, no bass. But the singer, who called herself Karen O, was otherworldly. She was dressed in a kind of “Clockwork Orange” burlesque, with cutout hearts as pasties. Before the show, she doused herself in olive oil. Onstage, she danced around like a lunatic, manically grinning and flinging droplets of oil from her hair into the crowd. The guitar player, Nick Zinner, had seen this side of her. But the drummer, Brian Chase, had practiced with the band only once, and this was their first gig. “The only thing to do,” Chase remembers thinking, “is just be like, ‘Whoa.’ ”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/get-yer-yeah-yeah-yeahs-out.html

But in a moment that speaks to this punk-icon-turned-accomplished-writer’s commitment to an objective distance from himself, he rhetorically asks, “How many kids were going to get excited about calling themselves ‘blank’?

2013-03-29,By Night in Chile,"In a summary, most literary careers nowadays — in New York or Zagreb — can look eerily similar. Take, for instance, the case of Alejandro Zambra. Zambra is a Chilean who has so far written three novels. He was born in 1975, and teaches literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago. He has figured on Granta’s list of best young Spanish-­language novelists, and the Bogotá39 project. His career, in other words, has the usual global vibe.
