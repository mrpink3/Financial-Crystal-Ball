One of her standbys was nilaga, a simple yet flavorful soup of slow-braised beef shanks, bone marrow and earthy vegetables. “Nilaga was something we had on regular rotation because it’s nourishing and could feed a lot of us,” says Dimayuga, 36, who, until recently, was the creative director of food and culture for the Standard hotels. “It’s an easy dish to make, since it’s all passive cooking: You throw the meat in with some water.” Come dinnertime, the family would gather around the huge pots, ladling steaming broth, marrow bones and fragrant rice into their bowls before crowding together to eat.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/t-magazine/nilaga-soup-recipe.html

The book’s narrator, who receives 8.5 million British pounds in damages after losing his memory in an accident, is a thumb in the eye of psychological coherence. He has no inwardness, only an obsession: the costly and elaborate re-enactment of half-remembered scenes from his past. These re-enactments, which resemble Situationist pranks, don’t chart a path back to wholeness and authenticity, as the damaged narrator seems to hope (and as the reader weaned on the realist tradition of Austen, Balzac and Henry James might expect).

2021-11-02,"Four, the Latest From Jesse Schenker, Opens on Long Island","After the chef Jesse Schenker made his name at Recette and The Gander in Manhattan, he decamped for the Long Island village of Oyster Bay, where he opened 2 Spring with Claudia Taglich, his business partner, in early 2018. Now, he has another restaurant ready to make its debut next door. Called Four, it’s in a historic Victorian cottage. (The two restaurants connect by a glass-covered pavilion that functions as an expanded dining room for 2 Spring.) Four has just 10 upholstered seats at a marble counter surrounding a demonstration kitchen done in simple Scandinavian style with blond wood set within the cottage’s white brick and siding. A painting of Anthony Bourdain is a centerpiece on one wall, and a huge Bonnet range equipped with a Japanese charcoal grill helms the kitchen. There, Mr. Schenker will be onstage so to speak, preparing and serving a 10- to 12-course tasting menu, $245, for one of the more elevated dining experiences available on Long Island. Mr. Schenker said he missed the ad hoc menus he used to prepare on Mondays at Recette. “I am thrilled for the opportunity to cook in a similar intimate style for my guests,” he said. Among the dishes he’s planning are an oyster tartlet, langoustine with Champagne essence, rigatoni with giant clam and chiles, foie gras with a duck fat croissant, Mishima Wagyu with wasabi and onion, and chocolate pot de crème. Mr. Schenker’s attention to detail will extend beyond the food and the list for 500 wines (from an underground cellar) to the tableware, with no pieces repeated throughout the dinner. Soon, he will open Provisions, a retail food shop, in a building around the corner. (Opens Thursday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/dining/new-york-restaurant-openings.html

Presumably, a lot of dramatic events occurred during that period. We have no way of knowing what most of them were. This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely think about the broad sweep of human history anyway. They don’t have much reason to.

The issue is that one mom whom I know through my community activities has pushed for friendships between her children — one of her girls in particular — and my 9-year-old daughter. But from what I’ve seen on social media she is a Trump supporter, has anti-immigrant views and has an “all lives matter” approach to police violence.

The murse, or the equally deplorable man bag, entered the pop-cultural conversation as a gender-normative joke: In 1998, Jerry Seinfeld’s TV alter ego, needing an alternative to his ballooning wallet, acquires a handbag (“It’s not a purse, it’s European!”); a year later, in a “Friends” episode titled “The One With Joey’s Bag,” the dopey soap opera actor struggles to give up his new accessory, even after it costs him an acting job. When he looks to his friend Rachel for advice, she stammers, “I’m not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just … it’s just there are other bags, you know, that are maybe a little less, um ... controversial.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/t-magazine/men-bags-purses-gender.html

2021-11-08,The Latest Trend in Baking? Making a Mess,"Billie Belo will never write “Happy Birthday” on her cakes. As the baker behind Cakes for No Occasion, she sees her offerings more as sculptures than comestible commodities: The tiered monstrosities ooze and drip. Her neon or pastel buttercream is often pocked with bulbous orbs that Belo, 38, doesn’t define as, say, truffles or cream puffs; in her decorating language, they’re simply balls, in flavors like lychee or raspberry, and they make her desserts seem not just alive but unwell. After studying painting at New York’s Grand Central Atelier, she began baking for her friends’ restaurant, Lil’ Deb’s Oasis, in Hudson, N.Y., a few years ago, then started her online business — each one-of-a-kind cake is sold by email from her Manhattan apartment — in 2018 after refining an impasto style that betrays what she calls the “tight” Victorian look of traditional cakes, where lines are clean and excess frosting is swept away. “There’s just so much caution in [that] realist style, and I felt imprisoned by it,” she says. “With cake, I want it to explode.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/t-magazine/messy-cakes-baking-instagram.html

Then you have the accomplished chef’s restaurant recipes, often inspired by Alsace, like foie gras terrine with separate steps for sauce, crust and finishing; lamb cooked in hay, requiring six recipes; cabbage stuffed with langoustines and scallops; and the marathon of Black Forest Craquelin that calls for nine preparations. But even at their most complex, the recipes hold promise for the home cook. A button mushroom soup stands deliciously on its own without the chorizo-potato raviolis alongside, and can easily be made to serve four or six instead of 12. And no matter the recipe, Mr. Kreuther fine-tunes the necessary details, even down to explaining the best way to line a terrine with plastic wrap.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/dining/gabriel-kreuther-the-spirit-of-alsace-cookbook.html

The greenish-gold oil — mostly from Kypriaki olives, an indigenous variety, with some koroneiki and arbequina — has a grassy aroma and warm richness finishing with a touch of bitterness.

2021-11-09,Jacqueline de Jong Paints It All,"The Dutch artist Jacqueline de Jong, 82, lives alone with her cat, Shosha, in a vertiginous central Amsterdam townhouse that she bought with her late husband, Tom Weyland, in 1992. Just before the pandemic, de Jong installed an elevator to ease her climb to the attic, where she keeps a painting studio tucked under the eaves. Going up and down in that lift — a “little prison,” she says — got her thinking about the tension between movement and confinement, a theme already on her mind as she watched the news, horrified by the unfolding refugee crises in Idlib, Syria, and the Mediterranean. It’s a testament to de Jong’s eclectic sensibility that she braided those thoughts together in a new body of work: “Border-Line,” a series of oil-stick paintings that mash up news imagery of the global migrant crisis — the rescue boat Sea Watch 4, huddled masses on rafts, fire at the Mória refugee camp on the island of Lesbos — with the kind of monstrous, cartoonish figures that frequently appear on her canvases. Here, they are ghostly lugs, hovering at the edge of the action, sometimes encased in little elevatorlike boxes (that de Jong made these paintings during Covid lockdown — “very much in confinement” — adds another layer). The series reflects her “personal desire to do something” about the migrant situation, but these ungainly interlopers seem to sound a note of self-critique: Like the artist and her presumed viewer, they empathize and gawk in equal measure.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/t-magazine/jacqueline-de-jong-art-border-line.html

2021-11-09,The 1619 Project and the Long Battle Over U.S. History,"On Jan. 28, 2019, Nikole Hannah-Jones, who has been a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine since 2015, came to one of our weekly ideas meetings with a very big idea. My notes from the meeting simply say, “NIKOLE: special issue on the 400th anniversary of African slaves coming to U.S.,” a milestone that was approaching that August. This wasn’t the first time Nikole had brought up 1619. As an investigative journalist who often focuses on racial inequalities in education, Nikole has frequently turned to history to explain the present. Sometimes, reading a draft of one of her articles, I’d ask if she might include even more history, to which she would remark that if I gave her more space, she would be happy to take it all the way back to 1619. This was a running joke, but it was also a reflection of how Nikole had been cultivating the idea for what became the 1619 Project for many years. Following that January meeting, she led an editorial process that over the next six months developed the idea into a special issue of the magazine, a special section of the newspaper and a multiepisode podcast series. Next week we are publishing a book that expands on the magazine issue and represents the fullest expression of her idea to date.

The architect James Biber, who designed the original restaurant with its signature parachute light fixtures, was on the job again, this time introducing a somewhat more subdued palette with splashes of color from the art on the walls (all for sale). There is new lighting, by David Weeks, the owner of David Weeks Studio in Brooklyn, that soars across the room in a series of stretched pale fabric wings. There’s a bright little lounge area up front. Bret Csencsitz, Gotham Bar & Grill’s former manager, and his business partner, Kevin Conrad, an environmentalist, bought the restaurant after it closed during the pandemic, and took on the reboot. Sensitive to Gotham Bar & Grill’s long tradition — it first opened in 1984 — Mr. Csencsitz named Ron Paprocki, its pastry chef of 10 years, to be the executive chef.

Growing up in Hawaii, Texas and Maryland, I ate rice three times a day: with fish for breakfast; with Spam and nori for lunch; with hamburger or more fish or tofu for dinner. In my childhood, Thanksgiving turkey was served not with mashed potatoes but rice; steak not with frites but rice; scrambled eggs not with toast but rice. (It wasn’t until I went to college on the East Coast that I finally experienced classic American dishes accompanied by their traditional starches.) And it was always the same kind: white, short-grain Japanese rice, polished and glossy, pleasantly clumpy and quick to yield between the teeth, clinging to the chopstick, sticking to the spoon. In adulthood, when rice became a kind of decadence, sacrificed in adherence to a supposedly healthier, definitely less satisfying low-carb diet, the mere scent of it made me wistful — how much easier life seemed before rice became so complicated.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/travel-rice.html

You can’t see what’s happening. All that’s visible if you lift the lid is the soft, yielding rice on top, fluffy and preening. But don’t lift the lid, and don’t stir. Maybe you tuck a towel around the rim for a tighter seal to catch drips of condensation; maybe you flick the flame up high, lean in to hear the last rustle of water boiling off, then shut down the burner and let the pot be, sitting there ticking in the fading heat. You have to rely on your sense of smell to recognize when the gorgeous scent of roasting is near its peak — when it hits that note of popcorn just bursting to life, kernels turning themselves inside out, or of hot chestnuts from street carts in winter, tossed in woks with tiny black stones and shucked of their sleeves — to save it before it ends in bitterness.

Thiof, a white grouper, is such common Senegalese restaurant fare that the Wolof word itself is slang — a handsome man is also a thiof, a “good catch.” I’d eaten beachside thiof south of Dakar in the vacation area of Saly, and cliffside thiof at breezy restaurants in Les Almadies, the Dakar neighborhood known for its nightlife. This thiof, though rubbed with spices like the others — I tasted ginger, garlic, cardamom, maybe turmeric — was served with a tiny cup of warm tamarind glaze. If there were vegetables on the plate, I have banished them from my memory; only the sauce, fish and rice were in conversation. The skin of the thiof was crisp and juicy, the sauce tangy and rich. The rice was not as long as basmati, nor as short as sticky rice, but a size in between, round through the middle with little adhesion and a firm but pliant texture. If food encapsulates pleasure, innovation and community all at once, then tasting the Platonic ideal of a simple dish can bring a place and its people into focus, even if you encounter that ideal in an unlikely setting — a lighthouse restaurant known for its brunch.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/senegal-homegrown-rice.html

The shadow of the plane, like a fighter escort, followed us as we descended, then was subsumed by the rain-drenched tarmac. The sky was full of light. Leaving the small white airport, we passed a palisade of organ pipe cactuses. There was blue-leaved agave in the traffic islands and, lining the streets, the trees of my childhood in Delhi — flamboyant, laburnum, jacaranda — were in flower. A nondescript modern town of brightly shuttered shops, auto repair and signs that read “aluminio y vidrio” gave way to a fully intact Spanish colonial town from the 16th century. “Downtown: local people,” my driver said, observing the change, “centro histórico for foreign people.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/mexico-rice-conquest.html

The doll reached forward, porcelain lips parted, as if to touch the artist on the other side of the glass. Equipped with a miniature phonograph in place of a heart, the antique toy once emitted nursery rhymes. “Back then, to see and experience a talking doll must have been just completely uncanny and frightening,” says Kurant. It’s impossible, she says, for us to grasp how shocking the spectacle would have been for 19th-century consumers, now that the breakneck pace of technological discovery has numbed us to even the most startling innovations. But that is what Kurant seeks to conjure in her work: the eerie, uneasy wonder we used to feel toward progress that augured new ways of life.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/t-magazine/agnieszka-kurant-art.html

A few years later, they hired the cartoonist Raymond Peynet — famous in France for his illustration of two young lovers, known as “Les Amoureux” — to draw the atelier’s distinctive red elephant logo, which helped drive the brand’s early success. By the ’60s, the house had expanded into leather accessories, and in 1967 it presented its first women’s ready-to-wear collection, featuring effortless but elegant pieces that it referred to as “couture sportswear.” Then, one day in 1972, as Vipiana was driving around the city, her car broke down in front of the Arc de Triomphe. Stranded along the Place Charles de Gaulle, she noticed the intricate motifs on the wrought-iron chains encircling the perimeter of the monument. The ornamental links inspired her to create a new coat of arms, this one with two nested C’s facing in opposite directions. The crestlike decoration went on to become Celine’s now-iconic Triomphe emblem — and has appeared on everything from button-down foulards and rhombus-patterned cardigans to handbags and chunky gold chains.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/t-magazine/celine-triomphe-jewelry-paris.html

Champions of competition — whether in music or poetry, sport or combat — were crowned with wreaths fashioned from fragrant bay laurel and olive leaves, emblems of victory and power. Winners of the Pythian Games — an athletic and artistic contest held in the sixth century B.C. in honor of the god Apollo, who is often depicted wearing a wreath of broadleaf evergreen himself — bowed their heads for bestowal of their chaplets, as did Roman soldiers returning from battle. In Greek, the word “wreath” is diadema, or “diadem”; in Latin, it became known as a corona, or “crown.” But these first wreaths weren’t just for ceremonial coronations. Some were cut from gold to resemble myrtle and were worn as headdresses by royals and the elite to mark their social rank and stature. Others were said to have been hung by despairing Grecian suitors on the doors of their unrequited loves, these gestures of devotion and longing echoing Apollo’s own relentless pursuit of the river nymph Daphne, who was transformed into a laurel tree after pleading with her father, the river god Peneus, to rescue her.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/22/t-magazine/contemporary-wreaths-female-florists.html

2021-11-23,How to Stand Correctly,"“We have to fight gravity to stand upright,” says James Murphy, the director of the Iyengar Yoga Institute of New York, whose discipline focuses on correct alignment in order to hold poses for longer. Standing properly — and improving posture in general — can help prevent back pain, which persistently afflicts some 16 million American adults, according to data published by Georgetown University. “You might see people, as they grow older, they start to bend over, with the spine collapsing, and they’re staring at the ground while they’re walking — they can’t stand upright anymore,” Murphy says. Plant your feet about hip distance apart; the weight on each foot should feel the same. Establish equilibrium by spreading the pinkie toe as far away from the big toe as possible. “You can feel how weight might shift a little bit from the inside of your foot, to the outside, the front to the back,” says Murphy, who considers standing pose to be central in most of the classes he teaches. Next, bring your feet together so your big toes and heels touch. This action forces your muscles to engage in balancing you.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/magazine/standing-yoga.html

Nearby family assembled into a small, masked audience. When my sisters and I arrived, a few people were departing. In the clamor of hellos and farewells, I missed being introduced to the man — not much taller than me, gray-haired — I assumed was a family friend.

Resembling panicles of wisteria, the fixture features both down and up spotlights for traditional illumination, as well as a constellation of LEDs embedded in the limbs, allowing the blossoms, which can be custom tinted, to cast rainbow shadows everywhere. “People step into the room when it’s on,” says Wood, “and suddenly they discover that they’re part of the disco.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/t-magazine/bethan-laura-wood-chandelier.html

When the chemistry was miniaturized and put on a silicon chip, reading DNA became fast, cheap and widespread.

This might sound like a trivial anachronism. But it’s typical of the movie’s attitude toward nostalgia, which relishes references at the expense of inconsistencies. In one moment the adolescent heroes are brandishing a 1989 Billy Ripken Fleer card; in the next they’re navigating the Cabbage Patch Kids craze, which happened in 1983.

Eventually, she joined Martin uptown, after which they moved first to a condo in Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights neighborhood, and then to a rowhouse in Crown Heights. In 2018, the couple, who by this point had two young daughters in tow, purchased and embarked on a gut renovation of a detached two-story home in Windsor Terrace.

Reportedly produced by the Coca-Cola Company circa the 1970s or 1980s, the six-foot-tall sculpture was one that Pessin, a collector and dealer of strange objects and furniture, says he had been “thinking about seriously” for quite some time, a kind of white whale in his yearslong pursuit of tracking down various quotidian items rendered in Claes Oldenburg-like proportions. He’d recently lost out on a plastic rotary phone fit for a giant (“It still haunts me,” he says), though who knows where it might have gone in a 1,500-square-foot space already overstuffed with a to-scale sculpture of the Modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; a massive leather chair modeled on the glove of the legendary Yankees center fielder Joe DiMaggio; a human eye-shaped bowling ball that lolls on Pessin’s couch in place of a throw pillow; and a papier-mâché Ticonderoga pencil, nearly as long and yellow as a school bus, that lines the balcony railing of the bedroom upstairs.

A few months later, on a cold February morning, the designer presented his first haute couture collection in the townhouse’s Trianon gray Louis XVI-style salons to an audience of buyers and fashion editors. “In 1947, after so many years of wandering,” Dior writes in his 1956 autobiography, “couture was weary of only catering [to] painters and poets, and wanted to revert to its true function, of clothing women and enhancing their beauty.” The clothes he designed, as he puts it, were “for flowerlike women, with rounded shoulders, full feminine busts and hand-span waists.” Among the silhouettes in his debut Corolle line (named after the botanical term for flower petals), one in particular stood out: the Bar Jacket. Constructed in cream silk shantung, the veste was sculpted to fit snugly above a narrow waist, then flare into a scalloped basque, which was meticulously padded, stiffened and weighted to accentuate the hipline. Paired with a very full skirt, it was dubbed the New Look by the press — and set off a sartorial revolution.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/t-magazine/dior-bar-jacket.html

2021-11-30,How to Make a Personal Logo,"“Start in the subconscious,” says Steve Powers, an artist who gives free workshops on logo making. You might need what Powers calls a personal moniker for a letterhead, thank-you notes, to sign artwork or legal documents. Powers says the emblem should represent an aspect of yourself that goes back to a childlike state, something that is a simple visual extension of who you are. “Let your 3-year-old inner self take the wheel and draw something,” Powers says. “You can get into this mind-set by drawing right when you’re out of a nap.” He recommends a midday nap for which you take off your socks, get under the covers and fall into a good deep sleep — “then when you’re out, you’re ready.” A nap helps you free associate without questioning the designing you do.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/magazine/make-a-logo.html

On my wedding day, in September 2013, it was no different.

2021-11-30,Discovering a Secret Wonderland of Architecture in Dallas,"Growing up in Dallas, I saw the city as an architectural wasteland. It had some beautiful art museums, sure, and a gleaming forest of downtown skyscrapers, but its fundamental identity seemed to be suburban sprawl, McMansions and strip malls. The idea of public space felt foreign, something I could access only through movies where people loafed around Central Park and sipped espressos in packed Italian piazzas. My experience of public life was weekend soccer games and deserted granite plazas glimpsed from the back seat of my parents’ car. Sometimes I’d take school field trips downtown, and the bus driver would make a pit stop at Pioneer Plaza, one of the city’s biggest parks, which contained 39 bronze cattle sculptures but not a single bench.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/magazine/dallas-architecture.html

This person was supposedly “considering” vaccination but also claimed to have religious reasons for refusing it. However, those she chose to work with are especially vulnerable: They cannot wear masks, cannot currently be vaccinated and are still forming their immune systems. When we pressed the owner of the school, she said she could not find qualified vaccinated individuals to take the job. We see vaccination as a public duty, not a personal choice, especially when working with vulnerable populations. I don’t consider even a religious exemption to be ethical. Is there another way to look at it? Kalie Z.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/magazine/religious-exemption-covid-vaccine-ethics.html
2021-11-30,In a World of Pure Imagination,"When I was hired for this job in early 2017, one of the first things I did was make a wish list of who I wanted to feature in the magazine. At the top of that list was Hayao Miyazaki, the greatest animator in history and the creator of films so singular, so strange, so visually arresting, that to watch them is to be in some way imprinted by them: Years later, one remembers scenes and images from them with an uncanny clarity, the way one might recall scenes and images from one’s own life. In Miyazaki’s world, people and creatures are often transformed: wizard into bird, human into pig, river spirit into dragon. And this seems not just a narrative motif but a reflection of what the viewer herself experiences — one emerges from his films a different person. He is, simply, a sorcerer.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/t-magazine/hayao-miyazaki-tony-kushner-visionary.html
