Styles range from duffels and messengers to clutches and pouchettes — just the right complement to their edgy-yet-polished motorcycle-jacket-and-skinny-leather-pants aesthetic. The Syn, a spiraling half-clutch/half-shoulder bag made from Perch skin, blends Michael’s past as a commercial fisherman (straps have fisherman knots and braids) and Nicole’s penchant for utilitarian dressing. “We wanted to create something sculptural, in an interesting fabrication, yet keep it functional,” Nicole says.

Ms. Gibbs called the New York idea “especially promising” but would not comment further. The group is seeking $1 million in donations to save portions of the ship’s engine rooms, which are largely intact, and for other preservation work. A $5.8 million gift from H. F.

The film, the 41st feature-length work that Mr. Allen has directed, is a romantic comedy whose cast includes Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, though one cast member, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has received a bit more attention than the others. In a statement, Thierry Frémaux, the director of the Cannes festival, described “Midnight in Paris” as “a wonderful love letter to Paris,” adding: “It’s a film in which Woody Allen takes a deeper look at the issues raised in his last films: our relationship with history, art, pleasure and life.” The film will be released in France on the same day it makes its debut at Cannes, though an American release date has not yet been announced.

Kate Atherton, Molly Merkler, Veronica Carnero, Casey Loomis and Adam Scher performed separate vignettes, each specifically programmed by the technical director, Christopher Langer, to sync with the piece’s emotional core. As an opener, Merkler performed in almost complete darkness; a sensor strapped to her stomach detected her breathing and illuminated a light bulb overhead with every inhale. Later in the lineup, Atherton began her more up-tempo piece against the backdrop of a blank projection. As the piece went on, time-lapsed footage of her movements appeared in repetition every 30 seconds, creating an army of her own image that seemingly danced along with the real performer.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/notes-from-the-underground-adam-scher-dance-company/

He’s on deck again this year, for the Coen brothers’ “True Grit.” Many of his honors came from his collaboration with the Coens; he has been their go-to cinematographer since “Barton Fink.” They first met more than two decades ago, at a coffee shop in Notting Hill, in London. “By then they were great cult filmmakers,” Mr. Deakins said, in a phone interview from his home in Santa Monica. “I don’t know why they had chosen to meet with me, but they did and we got on.” Does he understand them any better now? “I guess,” he said, laughing. But Mr. Deakins professed as much surprise as the Coens have about “True Grit” being such a box office hit. “It’s maybe more accessible than most of their films,” he said. “I think it’s a great movie, but I think most of their films are great movies.” He is currently working on “Now,” a futuristic thriller from the director Andrew Niccol (“Gattaca”), his first experience shooting in digital. What does he make of the divide between film and digital? “I don’t really see the point of the argument,” Mr. Deakins said. “You use images and light and texture and camera movement to tell a story. I think it’s a technical argument, and films aren’t really made by technique.”  ",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/a-q-and-a-with-roger-deakins-the-susan-lucci-of-cinematography/

But take a close look at the recent history of the interconnected lands that make up the Arctic and you’ll also find a dumping ground, ravaged and exploited cultures and a poorly regulated zone in which humanity’s worst instincts have been indulged. This distressing reality, and the enduring glimpses of beauty within it, is what Sara Wheeler’s new book, “The Magnetic North: Notes From the Arctic Circle,” is all about.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Morris-t.html
2011-02-04,Here’s Looking at Him,"Has any leading man ever made women work so hard to get his attention? There he is, just minding his own business when along comes some dame who gets it in her head that they should fall in love. She flirts with him, ­kisses him first, talks back when he tells her off, stays when he buys her a ticket to go. He puts up a fight with all the grim resolve of a guy closing the shutters on a storm that’s about to raze his house. Sooner or later, the dame, who happens to be beautiful, wears him down and he comes around, against his better judgment. Humphrey Bogart’s shell was “a carapace,” as Stefan Kanfer writes about one of his roles, “meant to cover the psychic injuries of a decent man trying to forget the past.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Brubach-t.html

2011-02-04,Primal Urges,"Vladimir Nabokov claimed that the “initial shiver of inspiration” for “Lolita” came from a newspaper account of an ape in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris that produced the first drawing ever made by an animal. “This sketch,” he reported, “showed the bars of the poor creature’s cage.” The story neatly encapsulates the tragedy and comedy of Humbert Humbert: for all his preternatural brilliance — no one of his kind has ever set such things down on a page — he knows less than nothing because he doesn’t know that a world exists outside himself. The narrator of Benjamin Hale’s first novel, “The Evolution of Bruno Littlemore,” has some of Humbert’s erudition and much of his arrogance. Like Humbert, he is imprisoned for a murder he can’t bring himself to regret, and like Humbert’s, his confession is far less concerned with that act than with the scandalous love affair that precipitated it. The difference is that Bruno knows he is trapped, for he has “seen this cage from both within and without.” Also, Bruno is an actual ape.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Beha-t.html

To many, Eduardo Porter writes in “The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do,” the memo demonstrated that the World Bank “believed poor countries were dumps.” While Summers back­pedaled, calling the argument an exercise in “sardonic counterpoint,” it nevertheless cost him a lot of political capital in ­Washington.

Being tempted briefly to pilfer a ham “was like one of those moments when you realize you are dreaming in a foreign language: I realized that I was thinking like a ­laobaixing,” Fallows writes, using the rough Chinese equivalent of Joe Six-Pack. “But finally, I crept away, with the words ‘possibly dirty, very likely gone-bad prosciutto’ nagging me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Erard-t.html

2011-02-04,Graphic Books Best Sellers: ‘The Last Unicorn’," The novelist Peter S. Beagle is the latest author to have his work adapted into the graphic novel format. “The Last Unicorn,” from IDW, lands at No. 2 on our hardcover list this week. The novel, originally published in 1968, was also turned into an animated film in 1982. In her review of the film version, Janet Maslin wrote: “ ‘The Last Unicorn’ is an unusual children’s film in many respects, the chief one being that it is unusually good. This animated fable also features a cast that would do any live-action film proud, a visual style noticeably different from that of other children’s fare, and a story filled with genuine sweetness and mystery. Children, except perhaps for very small ones, ought to be intrigued by it; adults won’t be bored. And no one of any age will be immune to the sentiment of the film’s final moments, which really are unexpectedly touching and memorable.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/graphic-books-best-sellers-the-last-unicorn/

And in the telling of her strange tale she also, sadly, talks too much. She is a woman who is visited with unwanted visions, whether of the past or the future or some alternative present she often can’t tell. The novel begins with her account of the very first of what she calls her “forevisions”: when she was 7, she warned her older brother not to go out one summer night, and he was killed in a car crash. In the story’s present tense, she is in her mid-30s, living with her 11-year-old twin sons in the upstate New York town where she was raised, and occasionally turning her paranormal gifts to modest advantage by hiring herself out as a diviner; when asked, she’ll dowse for water in her neighbors’ fields. In the course of one of these expeditions, she sees something terrible — a young girl hanged from a tree.

The Waterbury Arts Magnet School in Waterbury, Conn., had planned to perform that August Wilson play this week, but postponed the performances after the recent heavy snowfalls in the Northeast. Dana Manning, the school’s fine arts coordinator, told The Republican-American newspaper of Waterbury that the bad weather had prevented rehearsals. Additional performances planned for next week were also likely to be rescheduled and new dates were not immediately announced. The Waterbury Board of Education said in January that the school’s production of the play, set in 1911 at a Pittsburgh boardinghouse where several freed slaves reside, could proceed, overruling an earlier decision by the superintendent, David L. Snead. Mr. Snead, who is black, had sought to cancel the play because the word “nigger” appears multiple times in its dialogue. During the board meeting at which the decision was announced, the production was defended by the high school students in its cast, as well as by James Bundy, artistic director of Yale Repertory Theater, where “Joe Turner” and other Wilson plays were developed.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/theater/05arts-SCHOOLPRODUC_BRF.html

Permits for “Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution” to film at local high schools were revoked last week after Mr. Oliver, left, failed to provide the Los Angeles Unified School District with a proposal of his plans for the show, according to Robert Alaniz, a spokesman for the school district, The Los Angeles Times reported. Mr. Alaniz said the district had had a bad experience with another reality show in the past. He also talked of the “conflict and drama” associated with Mr. Oliver’s show in Huntington, W.Va., saying, “We’re not interested in that.” Speaking at U.C.L.A.’s School of Public Health on Wednesday, Mr. Oliver said his filming permit was terminated because he could not promise the school district it would “look good.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/arts/television/07arts-LOSANGELESSC_BRF.html

Her children, Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright, and McGarrigle’s sister and longtime musical partner, Anna McGarrigle, are scheduled to perform on May 12 and 13 at Town Hall in Manhattan. They will be joined by their third sister, Jane McGarrigle, as well as by Jimmy Fallon, Emmylou Harris, Antony Hegarty, Justin Bond and several other performers, including Michel Pepin on guitar, Chaim Tannenbaum on mandolin and banjo, and Joel Zifkin on violin, all of whom were regular members of the McGarrigle band. “Everyone who met my mother, no matter how briefly, was struck by her worldly character matched with an otherworldly artistic aura,” Mr. Wainwright said of the tribute in an e-mail. “It’s all in the songs now. I can’t wait to hear them performed by all of these incredible artists.” Ms. McGarrigle learned she had a rare form of cancer in 2006 and died at her home in Montreal in January 2010. She was 63.

2011-02-07,A Sleepy Winter Continues at the Box Office,"Movie audiences in North America spent about $75.4 million on tickets over the weekend, a 24 percent decline from a year earlier. The soft result extends Hollywood’s losing streak to 13 “down” weekends in a row. “Avatar,” which was still raking in box office cash at this time last year, is only part of the explanation. A ho-hum batch of releases in recent weeks has also contributed to lackluster sales. For the weekend, a traditionally slow one because of the Super Bowl, “The Roommate” (above, with Minka Kelly, left, and Leighton Meester), a horror entry from Sony Pictures Entertainment, was No. 1 with an estimated $15.6 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. “Sanctum,” a 3-D horror film set in underwater caves, was second, selling about $9.2 million for Universal Pictures and Relativity Media. The romantic comedy “No Strings Attached” (Paramount Pictures) was third with about $8.4 million for a new total of $51.8 million. “The King’s Speech” (the Weinstein Company) was a close fourth with roughly $8.3 million ($84.1 million total). “The Green Hornet” (Sony) chugged away in fifth place with $6.1 million, lifting its total to $87.2 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/movies/07arts-ASLEEPYWINTE_BRF.html

To more bipartisan audiences, though, he cast himself as a cold-eyed realist  the rightful heir to George H. W.

The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, charged the Weinsteins with “accounting tricks and financial deception” in connection with “Fahenheit 9/11,” which took in about $222 million at the worldwide box office, and millions more on home video. Bert Fields, a lawyer for the Weinsteins, said Mr. Moore had been paid everything he was due, and was trying to make a public spectacle out of what he called “a routine kind of auditing” dispute. “Mr. Moore has put in a number of very inflammatory claims designed for the press,” Mr. Fields added. “He should be ashamed of himself.” Larry Stein, a lawyer for Mr. Moore, said in a statement that Mr. Moore had never sued anyone in his filmmaking career and that “it’s very sad that it had to come to this.”Mr. Moore and the Weinsteins have worked together on several films, including “Sicko” and “The Big One.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/michael-moore-sues-weinsteins/

According to Nielsen’s estimates, Fox’s “Glee” attracted 26.8 million viewers, a record for this hit musical comedy and more than any other scripted series on television in three years. In comparison, however, ratings for the episode fell short of those for last year’s occupant of that highly desirable time slot, CBS’s reality show “Undercover Boss,” which garnered 38.7 million viewers. Final audience figures for “Glee” and Fox’s Super Bowl coverage were not immediately available on Monday; however, Nielsen’s preliminary overnight estimates from the major media markets were up about 3 percent from a year ago, when CBS’s Super Bowl broadcast set a ratings record with 106.5 million viewers, the largest television audience in United States history. Opposite the ratings juggernaut on Fox, CBS fared the best with 3.9 million viewers for a rerun edition of “60 Minutes” at 7, followed by reruns the rest of the night.

He was among the first people in Ireland to go public about being sexually abused by Catholic clergy — one of those who set off the intense bout of soul-searching that has racked the country lately. When I met Madden last fall in Dublin, the early rumbles of the collapse of Ireland’s economy were shaking the country, and throughout much of a pub lunch he talked about the failures of the government and the banks. It was only later, once we were driving around his old neighborhood, past the pebbledash house where he grew up and where his parents still live, that he began to talk about his childhood. As we sat in his car in front of Christ the King Church, where he spent much of his youth as an altar boy and a choir member, he outlined the four years of torment he suffered in the late 1970s at the hands of the Rev. Ivan Payne, one of the infamous serial sex offenders among the Irish Catholic clergy whose stories have transfixed the country over the past year and a half.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/magazine/13Irish-t.html

My favorite involves having a sip every time a character on a reality-TV show says the word “journey.” (It’s become such a cliche that unless you have Burton’s constitution, I recommend a sip instead of a shot.) As far as games go, it’s as elastic as a pair of Spanx and works equally well while watching the crimes against fabric on “Project Runway” or the unbeweavable hair don’ts on “Hair Battle Spectacular.” But real-life fashion people care more about instant gratification than the process.

The camera was to take a photograph every minute as the professor, Wafaa Bilal, went about his day. The project, which raised privacy concerns at the university, was called ”The 3rd I,” and was organized by a new Qatari museum called Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art. According to the Chronicle, the device, which was installed by a body modification artist in a tattoo shop in Los Angeles, was originally mounted on three posts that were attached to a titanium plate implanted between Mr. Bilal’s skin and his skull. But Mr. Bilal’s body rejected one of the posts, despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, and he was in constant pain. So on Friday he had the post removed. While the wound heals, he is tying the camera to the back of his neck. Why didn’t he do that in the first place? “It’s a performance,” he told the Chronicle. “With the performance comes endurance. But also it’s a commitment. And I didn’t feel that strapping something around my neck would be the same.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/no-more-looking-backward-professor-has-camera-removed-from-his-head/

Tahrir’s troubadour collective has specialized in the invention of slogans that are witty, abusive and aimed directly at the president, e.g., “Mubarak, you rhinoceros (kharteet), / get out, get out, you pest (ghateet).” Sometimes, perhaps to signal a certain gravitas, they dispense with rhyme and say it straight: “The people want the fall of the regime.” Along with the chanting, there has been much baladi music — a catchy, popular style, heavy on hooks and reverb — as well as poetry recitations and effigy hanging. This is Egypt’s folk culture: profane, bawdy, politically sophisticated. It stands as a direct challenge to the version of culture propagated by the Mubarak regime and its predecessors.

These photographs were also the result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, the former art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York.

The bureaucracy had not gone along; indecisive leaders who didn’t know the man they were trying to snag, who didn’t read his writings, had thwarted and betrayed the hunt. And still, after the calamities, after all the disasters inflicted upon us by this elusive and cunning adversary, we haven’t yet understood what we are up against.

The opening pages, Genesis-like, call the child’s world into being, his early life created via a series of severe directives: “Birth him with his father away” and “Move the family to a tobacco county in Southside Virginia” and “Make the ­mother cry and miss her mother.” The special child in question, we come to understand, is Richard himself. It’s an uncommon way to introduce the protagonist of a memoir, but an apt way to frame this absorbing account of growing up in the 1960s South, living with a disability, becoming a writer and finding faith. Richard’s book attests to the power of words (and the Word) in shaping a life, while at the same time challenging some dearly held beliefs about memoir as a genre.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/books/review/Bynum-t.html

(It’s also No. 8 on the e-book list, on Page 23.) Call Drummond the Prairie Dog Mother: she mixes the chipper can-do spirit of Laura Ingalls Wilder, the slick production values of Martha Stewart and steely domestic ambition that Amy Chua might approve. At her Web site, vicarious homesteaders can read instructions on topics ranging from how to load hay onto your feed truck and knock down fences to how to make Pasta ai Quattro Formaggi and spiff up digital photographs. (Photoshop’s “define and sharpen” feature is apparently “really good for animal hair.”) Drummond has said she started her blog mainly as a way of sharing photos with her mother. Now, she offers lavish down-home food porn like a 39-shot pictorial on “Perfect Potatoes au Gratin,” a perfect accompaniment to the copious beefcake shots of her Wrangler-rocking husband, a k a Marlboro Man, cuddling a baby or wearing chaps or “nourishing” cows, his face usually shadowed under the brim of a cowboy hat. “When my husband and I got married, we became one flesh,” Drummond wrote in a recent post. “So when he spends eight hours tearing down and building fence, it’s like I do, too.

Phil Hunt, thoughtfully described as “a good man, made up of all the bad things in the world,” did a 10-year stretch in prison for killing a shopkeeper during a dumb robbery. But this flawed man was rescued by a strong woman who became his wife, and in the 20 years that Hunt has been out, they’ve made a quiet, decent life together on a small farm south of Seattle where they raise and board horses.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/books/review/Crime-t.html

2011-02-11,Backstage Beauty | Peter Som,"“Peter’s inspiration was a very fabulous American artist called Cindy Sherman,” said the (very fabulous French) makeup artist Tom Pecheux backstage at Peter Som. “She does self-portraits where she takes herself on a crazy journey. She always brings a twist into her face, so in terms of makeup we wanted to do that.” This translated into nearly nude skin (with a bit of rosy blush and a touch of shimmery powder topping cheeks), bare brows, lashes and eyelids, punctuated with a statement lip. “We started with a red lipstick, the definition of a grown-up woman,” said Pecheux, noting that the designer’s fall 2011 collection seemed more adult to him than previous seasons. “To twist it, we are adding a layer of metallic color.” Lips were lined with M.A.C. Cherry Lip Pencil, filled in with a lipstick color being tested for fall tentatively called Runaway Red (according to M.A.C., Dare You is the closest shade currently available), dusted with M.A.C. Invisible Powder, and then dabbed with M.A.C. pigments in silver, rose gold and melon. “I’m not a fan of a lip with shimmer, a frosted lip — I think it’s cheesy,” said Pecheux of his matte metallic creation. The look was paired with a hairstyle inspired by Tippi Hedren’s character in “The Birds,” using Wella Ocean Spritz for texture and extensions with roots dyed into them. “It gives the hairstyle depth, it makes hair look thicker, the minute you have a root it makes hair look thicker and a bit denser,” the hairstylist Eugene Souleiman, who crafted the look, explained of the extensions. “It’s a little like when I used to do Prada and Miu Miu. It has that ’90s take on the ’50s — it’s slightly minimal, but now it’s a bit more raw.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/backstage-beauty-peter-som/

Now the producers of the Broadway musical “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” are offering $60 goodie bags to people who serve in focus groups that will respond to several performances. Two focus groups attended Thursday night’s performance, and four more are scheduled to be at Friday night’s show and the Saturday matinee. It’s not unheard of for Broadway producers to use focus groups, and the musical has used them before since preview performances began on Nov. 28. But these are the first since largely negative reviews of the show by theater critics across the country were published on Tuesday. OnTrack Research, a marketing and consulting firm, is coordinating the focus groups, and here’s the rub: participants only get to see Act I or Act II, not both. They are then asked to fill out surveys and join in discussions in a “V.I.P. room.” The details of the focus groups were outlined in an e-mail to participants from OnTrack Research. Here is the full e-mail, which a focus group participant passed along and which was authenticated by the production on Friday.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/more-focus-groups-for-spider-man-turn-off-the-dark/

When it comes to analytical data in sports, however, coaches in particular face a unique challenge in passing along the statistical information they deem important. It’s not enough to know that a player is most effective running one type of play or shooting from one area of the floor. Coaches today must also understand how to convey that information in a way that makes it digestible and useful.",Sports,https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/chris-bosh-and-the-self-fulling-prophecy/

2011-02-14,Kitsch of the Day | Takarazuka,"For the modern YouTube hunter the world of Japanese television and pop culture can be a seemingly bottomless treasure trove. Among some of the finest gems are clips like the one above of Takarazuka, a 98-year-old Japanese song and dance troupe that specializes in performing adaptations of Western pop songs, classic musicals, operas, plays, novels or films as well as Japanese folk tales. (The clip above shows the musical number “The Great Century,” which incorporates the ’80s soft rock anthem “Final Countdown.”) But in a bizarre twist on the idea of an all-male Shakespearean cast, the members of the ensemble are all women — making Takarazuka perhaps the only Vegas-style musical theater group in the world with professional drag kings on permanent payroll. But despite appearances, Takarazuka was never meant as an early-20th-century chorus line for Japanese women’s liberation. To this day, cast members are put through a rigorous and patriarchally organized training program for several years before they are even allowed to set one foot on stage, with “female” (musumeyaku) and “male” (otokoyaku) actresses strictly separated in classrooms and dormitories. The inevitable lesbian overtones were largely ignored until the mid- to late 1930s, when Japanese officials were alarmed to a point that a ban on contact between the “male” cast members and their passionate female fans was imposed. To this day, most of Takarazuka’s over-2.5 million-strong annual audience consists of women, and so do the performers: an attempt in the 1940s to introduce male actors was successfully boycotted by Takarazuka’s own disgruntled cast.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/kitsch-of-the-day-takarazuka/

Knight, reported on Friday that Mr. Muti had fainted because of “a common heart rhythm disturbance.” Although their tests reveal that he retains excellent heart function, they added, he has had a pacemaker installed to monitor his heart rhythm and deliver a small electrical charge if the heart rate should fall too low. “Patients with pacemakers live full and active lives with excellent prognosis,” the doctors concluded. Mr. Muti remains in Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is recovering from surgery for facial injuries incurred in the fall. He has canceled his remaining performances this winter, which were to run through Feb. 19.

Yet somehow, Jackson never made it back to his N.B.A. roots, back to his favorite city, back to the corner of 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue. Jackson interviewed with the Knicks three times over the last three decades but the timing was never right. In 1987, the Knicks passed up Jackson, then coaching the Patroons, to hire Rick Pitino. Jackson joined the Chicago Bulls’ staff. Twelve years and six championships later, Jackson — a free agent after leaving the Bulls — spoke with the Garden president Dave Checketts. The exploratory talks went nowhere and Jackson instead joined the Los Angeles Lakers. Jackson was a free agent again in 2005 when Isiah Thomas asked him to coach the Knicks. Jackson declined because he got a better offer: a return to the Lakers. Now 65, Jackson intends to retire from the N.B.A. after this season, and this time for good. The opportunity for a prodigal return has seemingly passed. But at least one authority on Jackson can still envision him joining the Knicks some day. “Phil is definitely a full-circle kind of a guy, and that would bring him full circle,” said Jeanie Buss, Jackson’s girlfriend and a Lakers executive.",Sports,https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/phil-jacksons-soft-spot-for-new-york/

Like you’d use eyeliner because you heard it would keep bugs away.” Unfortunately, at least for John Galliano during a damp summer, this last part is not true — but nonetheless, Westman’s handiwork, all done using the products she’s created with Revlon, is very pretty. “I’m using a purple lipstick on the bottom [lid] and then brown shadow over it, and then I’m using black liner to rim the eyes. I’m bringing the shadow down further than normal. The cheeks are just windswept; I’m using that same purple color all over the cheeks and the lips.” The hairstylist Guido Palau crafted very loose braids of varying thickness and number to go with the reference. “It’s very clean and natural,” he said. “I want it to feel hardly in there, so there’s a point of reference but it’s not overly anything–like when a girl starts braiding her hair by herself. It’s kind of an easy one.” Exactly what you’d want when hiking through the Himalayas or, you know, Brooklyn. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/backstage-beauty-rag-bone/

And since the overall goal was to “make hair look rough and not too groomed,” styles were finished with spritzes of TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Conditioner. For mysterious, sultry eyes, the makeup artist James Kaliardos used M.A.C. Satin Taupe and Charcoal Brown eye shadows and M.A.C. Brush #213, which “created a smoky eye without looking like sharp eyeliner.” Kaliardos then pressed M.A.C.’s Brit Wit Creme Blush into models’ lips and cheeks, and patted M.A.C. Line Filler all over the face to minimize pores and even out complexion. Forgoing foundation altogether, Kaliardos used concealer minimally, to “veil the skin” and not disguise individual imperfections.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/backstage-grooming-richard-chai/

She was filling in on sound byte duty for Paul Hanlon, the show’s key hairstylist, who was busy presiding over the swarm of stylists — three per girl — busy scraping hair back from the face, dousing it in product (chief among them Frederic Fekkai Coiff Bouffant Lifting & Texturizing Spray Gel), clipping it into twists and coils, and setting with a blow-dryer. “When the clips come out, they’re going to start to destroy [the shapes] by pulling out pieces to make it more 3-D,” said Outen. “When [the models] are in the line, Paul’s going to do his magic.” In between, the makeup artist Tom Pecheux painted on a glamorous take on the ’90s Kate Moss cat-eye. “I was like, what is a young designer like? Who does he want to dress? And which kind of woman wants to wear a cool young designer? A rock chick,” said Pecheux. His take replaced that “rock chick” staple, black liquid liner, with M.A.C. Rich Purple Chromagraphic Pencil on the eye’s waterline and M.A.C. Keep It Cool Eye Shadow (available fall 2011), used to a soft liner effect, brushed out to the brows. “I went for silver on the inner corner of the eye, almost like a futuristic tear.” And the crimson lip? “It’s a huge controversy! Because that lip color is so ladylike, so bourgeois,” said Pecheux with a laugh. “But I was like, why not break the rules?

But Lam hasn’t shied away from making beauty statements: most recently, the electric coral eyeliner and ’60s waves for spring 2011 created by the hairstylist Orlando Pita and the makeup artist Tom Pecheux, both of whom were on hand early on this Sunday morning to work that magic again. “The collection today is inspired by uniforms, so I did this school-girl uniform hairstyle, where the girl scrapes her hair back and puts a barrette in her hair,” explained Pita. “But we’re not doing the barrette, to keep it a bit more streamlined.” The hair was straightened with a T3 iron, pulled into a clean half-ponytail and set with T3 Control Hairspray. Pecheux created a slate gray smoky eye using silver and black Estee Lauder shadows (available this fall), which he paired with a nude matte lipstick, brow pencil, and Estée Lauder Bronze Goddess Soft Duo Bronzer. “Derek Lam’s clothes are very feminine and very luxurious, but very graphic and minimal at the same time,” said Pecheux, a sentiment that was echoed by the manicure Jin Soon Choi paired it with. “It’s a wintery white from Estée Lauder called Porcelain — very clean, minimalistic, bright white,” she said. “White nail polish works on short to medium length nails, and I did a round shape — I’ve done it at a lot of shows, it’s more feminine.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/backstage-beauty-derek-lam/

Stanton was soon calling Abraham Lincoln “the original gorilla” and joking that Du Chaillu was a fool to have gone to Africa for what he could as easily have found in Springfield, Ill.But the more common way to deal with our resemblance to monkeys and apes then was to fob it off onto other ethnic groups — typically black people, or sometimes the Irish.  A few white scientists even purported to find physiological evidence, in the configuration of the skull, for classifying other races as separate species, not quite as far removed as Caucasians from our primate cousins.  This undercurrent of scientific racism would play out to devastating effect in Du Chaillu’s own life.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/race-sex-and-the-trials-a-young-explorer/

2011-02-14,Those Crazy Swans,"With its unhinged ballerinas, lurid hallucinations, surfeits of blood and makeup, and one mad mother, the film “Black Swan” is hard to match as catnip for satirists of camp. The downtown theater artist Jack Ferver and his QWAN (Quality Without a Name) Company will take a stab with “Swan!!!,” a parody of the 2010 movie that will be staged as a dramatic reading from March 10 to 12 at Performance Space 122 in the East Village. The show is a follow-up to Mr. Ferver’s “Notes!!!,” a like-minded treatment of the Judi Dench-Cate Blanchett film “Notes on a Scandal“ that developed a cult following during performances downtown last spring and fall. According to production notes “Swan!!!” focuses on the ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman’s role in the film, played here by Jenn Harris), who is “freaking out because she is crazy.” Also crazy is her mother, played by Randy Harrison of Showtime’s “Queer as Folk” (and Barbara Hershey in the movie); her “Swan Lake” choreographer; and a former prima ballerina. Mr. Ferver will play the “hot new bad ballet girl in town,” Lily (Mila Kunis in the film), who becomes Nina’s frenemy. Mr. Ferver said in an interview that he had not gone through legal hoops with the creators of “Black Swan” because he and his collaborators were “appropriating the work into a camp spectacle,” meaning that parody is protected under fair-use exceptions to copyright law. “It is going to be insane,” Mr. Ferver promised. “Black Swan” has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including best picture and best actress for Ms. Portman; the Oscars ceremony is Feb. 27.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/theater/14arts-THOSECRAZYSW_BRF.html

Justin Bieber‘s 3-D concert movie, “Never Say Never,” was a close second for Paramount Pictures with an estimated $30.2 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. “Gnomeo and Juliet“ (Walt Disney Studios), with Elton John songs, was third with about $25.5 million, benefiting from a lack of animated competition in the marketplace and a hefty marketing campaign. “The Eagle,” a Focus Features release starring Channing Tatum as a Roman soldier, was a distant fourth with a projected $8.6 million. “The Roommate” (Sony) was fifth in its second week of release with $8.4 million, bringing the total for that low-budget thriller to $26 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/movies/14arts-SANDLERGOESW_BRF.html

2011-02-14,‘Big Love’ Watch: A Family in Crisis,"“I’m the sunny face of polygamy.” Let’s just acknowledge that this line, delivered by Margene, was surely the best of Sunday’s episode of “Big Love.” Margene, who is getting deeper into the crazy pyramid scheme that is Goji juice, has also become the spokeswoman for a family increasingly in crisis. But before we get to that and the impending divorce proceedings, I have a bone to pick with the haphazard unfolding of the episode. The matter of Alby hiring Verland to attack Don during his ice fishing trip felt random and pointless. This is the best way the writers could think of for Alby’s getting back at Bill for getting Lura away from him? Even as the scene was transpiring it seemed as if the writers were doing it on a lark and were fully conscious that the plotting was arbitrary and almost jokey. (The jaunty music accompanying the attack made this especially clear.)Also: Bill’s mother’s dementia isn’t feeling fully integrated either. Her dementia may be relevant to the season’s theme of the Henricksons’ general deterioration, but beyond that symbolic value, it’s hard to see how Lois’s condition will matter much to the final outcome of the show. Another plot development that felt half-baked was the sudden turnaround of Bill’s fate at the legislature.

The makeup artist Diane Kendal used Nars Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl on eyelids and on top of it, and applied three blushes — Desire, Taj Mahal and Exhibit A, in that order from inner lid to outer lid to an ombre effect — which she blended out past the bleached eyebrows. “We wanted to have that feeling of sun and hotness but then also exotic,” Kendal explained. The hairstyle created by Odile Gilbert using Kerastase products echoed that sentiment, with pieces provided by the designer weaved into a complicated-looking updo. Panichgual explained, “The hair is superslick — almost posh, really — in the front, and then it’s pulled back and it’s got this weird chignon whipped up with yarn and hats that we’ve cut up and put into the bun. There’s a reality base there, but it’s a bit hyper.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/backstage-beauty-thakoon/

To inspire us, last night was one of the music world’s biggest nights: the Grammy Awards. All you have to do now is to pick the right songs – today’s digital musical players and smartphones make it a snap to select them from your playlist to suit every mood. But what if you were stuck with a player that (thanks to Apple’s marketing genius) makes a virtue of randomness, like the iPod shuffle? This is the conundrum that gives rise to a fascinating puzzle contributed by Dion Wong of Australia. Previously, in When Randomness Produces Certainty, we saw how randomness acting over and over can create order. The question that arises in Dion’s puzzle is: How can we optimally combine randomness and order? It’s a fitting question for today because, no matter how orderly a plan you might have made for a perfect Valentine’s Day, randomness might just intervene. And the connection of randomness to the Grammy Awards ceremony is clear too – what random pattern of clothes (or what passes for them) did Lady Gaga wear?

2011-02-14,Backstage Beauty | Carolina Herrera,"Few designers create pieces as timeless as Carolina Herrera, and backstage at her fall show, the beauty team was hard at work creating a look to match. The makeup artist Diane Kendal painted on what she called “a classic Carolina face”: black cream eyeliner on the top lash line only with a bit of a wing, M.A.C. Haute and Naughty Mascara only on outer lashes, M.A.C. Eye Gloss on lids and M.A.C. Blush in Angel on the cheeks. “On the lips we’re using a new [M.A.C.] color called Prince Noir, and we’re applying it with a lip brush and then blotting it with tissue so it gives a really beautiful stained burgundy look,” Kendal said. Nails were kept relatively short and painted with two coats of a shade from Creative Nail Design called Dark Ruby followed by a generous coat of Super Shiney Top Coat, “to contrast the matte textures such as fur, velvet, suede,” said CND’s Wanda Ruiz. The hairstylist Orlando Pita, who took the “big, beautiful necklines” into account when creating his polished, rolled bun-chignon hybrid using Moroccanoil products, clearly also had the Carolina Herrera client in mind. “I’ve seen messy updos for a long, long time, and I’m moving away from them,” he said. “This collection is too polished for that.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/backstage-beauty-carolina-herrera/

2011-02-15,Backstage Grooming | Billy Reid,"Unlike designers who approach collections with a particular theme or era in mind, Billy Reid, the recipient of this year’s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, designs his piece by piece, which explains his infectious passion for the unique. For his fall collection, Reid said backstage, “My focus was on construction, a lot of tailoring. I spent an inordinate amount of time perfecting each piece. My men’s looks are cleaner, with more subtle details than before.” In line with Reid’s penchant for individuality, the hairstylist Marcos Diaz created looks that were “groomed but not Don Draper.” Using just the newly launched Mat Forming Ground from Davines (a supermatte clay) and his fingers, Diaz formed a natural-looking side part and left the rest of the hair “dry-looking and clean.” Emphasizing approachability, Diaz said, “I’m interested in keeping hair more realistic, something you could easily create at home.” The makeup artist Nadine Luke relied on a few key players from M.A.C. and her belief of “a little goes a long way” for men’s makeup. Luke hydrated skin with Studio Moisture Fix, concealed as necessary, moisturized lips with Lip Conditioner, and tamed unruly brows with Brow Set (which she considers a guy’s “secret weapon,” as it instantly grooms both brows and mustaches). Luke finished the look with Mineralize Skinfinish, a shimmer-free bronzer that contours and provides a matte finish in a pinch, noting that “Billy Reid’s guy is someone you wouldn’t imagine grooming because he’s slightly rugged. But really, he’s a polished gentleman.”Runway slide show",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/backstage-grooming-billy-reid/

But being the male face for Chanel, Fendi and Karl Lagerfeld (as well as starring in a Coca-Cola Light campaign) is apparently not enough for the slightly cross-eyed little Corsican that could; in late 2010 Giabiconi also embarked on a singing career and released his first single, “Showtime.” Even though the song has been out for a few months and enjoyed considerable chart success in France, it’s gone largely unnoticed by the American public. Granted, under normal circumstances the epic video (above) accompanying the release of the heavily auto-tuned single would not be considered kitsch; its Wild West theme, with Giabiconi saving a bodacious brunette from her abusive boyfriend, complete with explosive super powers in the Californian desert, is pop video cliché at its best. And Giabiconi’s English (“Woz wrong wiz you, man?”) is certainly better than Lady Gaga’s French. But the fact that it has Karl Lagerfeld’s blessing and the remote possibility of him doing a special cameo as a Bond-style villain makes it all the more enjoyable. That sadly doesn’t happen, but then again, Giabiconi knows how to keep us on our toes: the video ends with a promising “To be Continued.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/kitsch-of-the-day-baptiste-giabiconi-showtime/

The award, which is to be given annually, provides $50,000 to the writer and $100,000 toward the production costs for mounting the recipient’s play. Mr. Talbott’s winning play, “The Submission,” described as an exploration of the importance of cultural authenticity in authorship, will be produced next season at MCC Theater, which is led by Robert LuPone, Bernard Telsey, and William Cantler. The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award is among the most generous in playwriting, and it is intended for emerging writers. Mr. Talbott, 46, has written only a few plays and, as a playwright, still lacks an agent. Mr. Laurents, the book writer for “Gypsy” and “West Side Story” and the Tony Award-winning director of the original “La Cage aux Folles,” created the award last year. At 93, he is still writing plays himself; Mr. Hatcher, his partner of 52 years, died in 2006. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/laurents-hatcher-award-announced/

2011-02-16,Gore Vidal Political Play Returns,"Are the Iowa presidential caucuses really less than a year away? How time flies. But an election year looms, as does the return of “Gore Vidal’s The Best Man,” the deliciously tart (when done well) play about politics, campaigns and the presidency. Jeffrey Richards and his fellow producers announced on Tuesday that they would revive that 1960 play in the spring of 2012 with hopes of catching election fever. Originally titled “The Best Man,” Mr. Vidal’s play involves a showdown at a presidential convention between two candidates, in essence an Adlai Stevenson character and a Richard Nixon type, brokered by an ill ex-president and complicated by secrets, machinations, and troubled marriages. Broadway had a revival of “The Best Man” not so long ago, during the campaign between George W. Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle in the fall of 2000. With political resonance and a cast led by Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, and Charles Durning, that production started off strong at the box office but had mixed reviews and declining ticket sales before closing in late December. (Mr. Gore had conceded two and a half weeks earlier.) That 2000 revival was the first Broadway producing credit for Mr. Richards, who has been a press agent since the 1970s and is now one of Broadway’s busiest producers. He is reuniting his producing team from 2000 — Jerry Frankel, Michael B. Rothfeld, and Darren Bagert — to mount this production. The director will be Michael Wilson (“The Orphans’ Home Cycle,” “Dividing the Estate”).

Having spent nearly seven months of my four years at West Point in Egypt and Tunisia, I hold a special place in my heart for the people of both countries. After all, they helped me learn their language, and thus gave me a conduit to understanding the depths of one of the world’s most misunderstood regions.

(The gray she created will be named by Rodriguez and produced later this year.) The makeup artist Dick Page lined eyes with Shiseido cream shadows in Purple Dawn and Caviar, a black (available this fall). “I’m trying to leave the skin alone as much as possible. Since we’re at the beginning of the season, there are no big skin disasters yet,” Page said, joking that his own disaster — a black eye he acquired last week — inspired the look. One skin care product even made it onto models’ faces: Shiseido Benefiance Full Correction Lip Treatment, which was smudged onto the lids just before the show to create a melty effect. “It’s a ridiculously expensive lip balm,” Page said (it’s $36).

As the trains slammed and screeched overhead, he offered his hand to the mostly young and professional commuters heading downtown. Emanuel’s manner seemed more studied than spontaneous. He employed standard lines — “nice hat,” “good book” — and relied on the logos on riders’ head wear and jackets for conversation starters. He addressed both sexes as “man,” and when a woman asked about his plans for the Chicago Transit Authority, he was characteristically a trifle abrupt — “Here’s the deal,” he said to start — and egocentric. As he did with me, he told her the elevated line right above us was something “I built,” before saying “we,” apparently realizing he was discounting the work and leadership of many others. He hardly seemed like an irresistible force.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20Emanuel-t.html

In an interview, Mr. Hawass also defended himself against charges that he did not report the missing objects promptly. In the days after the museum was broken into on Jan. 28, Mr. Hawass claimed that, while 70 artifacts had been damaged, none had been stolen. Last Sunday he said that, in fact, 18 objects were missing from the museum. Two of the other objects, a heart scarab and a funerary statuette, as well as the goddess from a statue of a goddess carrying Tutankhamen, were found earlier this week. The Akhenaten statue was found in the garbage near Tahrir Square, Mr. Hawass said, by a boy whose uncle was a professor at the University of Cairo. “His uncle called me today, and I sent some of the police and archaeologists, and they found it is the statue of Akhenaten,” Mr. Hawass said. “We are going to look inside all the garbage that they collected from Tahrir Square to find the rest of the objects.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/arts/design/17arts-STOLENEGYPTI_BRF.html

A fashion lover who’s usually clad in cutting-edge ensembles by Azzedine Alaïa, Haider Ackermann and Rick Owens, she often gets stopped in shops and restaurants by women who want to know where she got her jewelry. “I’ve been tempted to sell things right off my body,” she jokes. Pagani (left, in a Versace dress and her own jewelry) describes her Queen Bee collection as a cross between Joan Crawford and Anita Pallenberg. “I don’t like classic stones by themselves,” she says. Instead, she mixes diamonds, sapphires and amethysts with moodier materials like jasper “zebra” agate, purple turquoise, Nubian opals and moonstones. “My pieces are a bit dark, but dark in a sophisticated way.” The earrings above are $16,105 at Ikram, in Chicago.

2011-02-17,Backstage Beauty | Proenza Schouler,"Fashion’s latest hairstylist darling, the charming Paul Hanlon, knows the Proenza Schouler girl quite well. Last season, he imagined she’d fallen asleep on a bus, and created what was meant to look like a French twist that had been battered by a long day (and a long commute, one assumes). This season, she’s grown her hair nearly to her elbows (Hanlon used 22-inch extensions) and pulled it into a low ponytail with some knotty nubs at the end. “When [designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez] called me in London, the first thing they said to me was that they loved the idea of the girls having really long hair. The first test we did, the girls had this really long straight hair, very blunt, but it didn’t feel like their woman — it was a bit army,” said Hanlon, adding that the boys were inspired by a cross-country road trip they’d just been on. As an alternative, Hanlon referenced photographer Edward S. Curtis’ portraits of American Indian women, their hair parted in the middle, heavy behind their shoulders. He began a very low braid, which he then tied with a black elastic, leaving the last loop halfway pulled through. After the tips of the hair were razor cut, the entire head was sprayed with Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray (through a net, a favorite Hanlon technique) for some “crunch.” “It’s like when girls go out and they leave their ponytail tucked into their jackets, and when they take it off it looks kind of wrong. I’m looking around at Diane’s assistants,” Hanlon said, referring to the makeup artist Diane Kendal, “and some of them walked in with their hair like that. It’s nice to have a wearable look. Hairstylists get a bit carried away sometimes.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/backstage-beauty-proenza-schouler/

One of its highlights is “Steel and Shade: The Architecture of Donald Wexler,” an exhibition at the Palm Springs Art Museum. Wexler, 85, has practiced in Palm Springs for almost six decades, developing an architecture that is acutely sensitive to the extremes of the desert climate. Wexler’s all-steel Alexander houses, designed in 1962 with the structural engineer Bernard Perlin for the developers George and Robert Alexander, were sustainable before sustainability was trendy. Affordable, elegant and quick to assemble on site, thanks to a prefabricated structural system, Wexler’s houses (their framing, roofs and exterior siding are steel, with drywall interior siding) were the perfect answer to the postwar housing boom. “Steel, concrete and glass are ideal materials for the desert,” Wexler says. “They are inorganic and don’t deteriorate in the extreme temperatures of the desert.” And since these structures are relatively maintenance-free, the seven Alexander houses in a north Palm Springs enclave are as pristine today as they were almost 50 years ago.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/seeing-things-donald-wexler-desert-modernist/

2011-02-18,Backstage Beauty | L’Wren Scott,"“A dangerous eye — that’s what L’Wren said to me,” said the makeup artist Aaron de Mey backstage at L’Wren Scott. “It conjured up images of smokiness. I also love this kid Taylor Momsen very much — it’s interesting to see how a teenager would apply her makeup.” To wit, de Mey created an exaggerated version of the kind of black eye makeup he said Scott herself always wears, which included heaps of Lancome Hypnose Mascara (in black, of course) and black eye shadow layered over pencil for a gothic look. “There’s no highlight, no skin showing through,” he said. The hairstylist Serge Normant also was inspired by the designer: “The way L’Wren wears things, it doesn’t look overly done. The girls aren’t supposed to look like her, but I wanted that easiness.” Hair was brushed into a deep side part with volume added through the crown of the head for a “just woke up” look, which Normant set with products from his new namesake product line. The manicurist Yuna Park filled out the look with one coat of a gold-flecked black nail polish from Lancome called Noir 29, available this fall. You know you love it.

A closer friend was sure that words were tumbling forth, too. “Knowing how you write,” the friend said in a condolence note, “you may already be completing the first of many novels that will help you explore what you’ve been experiencing.” Oates felt herself “shaking with cold, with a kind of choked fury.” The Wonder Woman of American Letters, as she learned an exhibitor of her vast array of books had christened her, could not compose even a thank-you note. “Yes it’s true that I used to be a writer — a writer with a very mixed reputation — ‘controversial’ is the kindest term,” she imagined trying to explain at a somewhat calmer moment. “But now — I am not a writer now. I am not anything now. Legally I am a ‘widow’ — that is the box I must check. But beyond that — I am not sure that I ­exist.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/books/review/Hulbert-t.html

He didn’t complete his bachelor’s degree until he was 39, working in politics — mayor of Pittsfield, Mass., aide to President Carter, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee — then running first one, then another community college. But Trinity was a troubled institution, and the trustees weren’t looking for another tweedy scholar. Enrollment was down even as the liberal-arts school was accepting 65 percent of all applicants — a striking contrast to its rivals Amherst and Williams, which typically admit fewer than 20 percent of their applicant pools. The biggest problem was Trinity’s immediate surroundings, the crime-­ridden, blighted neighborhood of Frog Hollow in Hartford. So Dobelle started an ambitious $225 million public-private urban-renewal project to improve the area — including the construction of three schools and a performing-arts center — without pushing its residents out. Then he turned to the college’s sports programs, wondering if there might not be a quicker way to improve Trinity’s brand.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20Squash-t.html

She looked down at her hands and arms. Her fair skin was nearly hidden by vicious-looking streaks of red. “And it’s everywhere.” She lowered the office gown to reveal scarlet lines crisscrossing up her arms, across her neck, down her back, chest and abdomen.

There were exceptions, of course, like the cerebral, political Tom Lehrer — but let’s just say that, in general, Lenny Bruce and George Carlin did not sing. The novelty song was an outlet for nerds, morning-show shock jocks and the kind of guys who put the word “weird” in front of their names. This might help explain why the era of the novelty song seemed to end right around the time that hip-hop came of age: the greatness of Weird Al’s “Straight Outta Lynwood” notwithstanding, the average funny-song singer was not cut out to spoof N.W.A.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20Lonely-t.html

Their mortgages are subject to scholarly study, their medical records sold in shadowy alleys, their childhood friends dunned to offer up nuggets of gossip.

But sadly, I have finally come to recognize that after all that turning, smelling and caressing, what remains are piles of old magazines collecting dust. The new digital version may seem less substantial, but it doesn’t have those annoying loose subscription cards or peel-and-sniff perfume ads that induce headaches (and depressing sensory memories). What’s more, I don’t have to tie up digital magazines for disposal on recycling day. So I canceled all but one print subscription, and now I get my periodical enjoyment from an iPad.

2011-02-18,Wise Guy,"The problem with writing a biography of Socrates, as Bettany Hughes merrily admits, is that he’s a “doughnut subject”: a rich and tasty topic with a big hole right in the middle where the main character should be. Despite his fame and his insistence on an examined life, Socrates never wrote anything, and our knowledge of him comes mainly from three contemporaries — his devoted pupils Plato and Xenophon, and the parodist Aristophanes — each of whom had his own agenda. He produced no great answers, only great questions, and the most enduring image we have of his life is his leaving of it, as the title of this book suggests.

2011-02-18,Misery Loves Company,"In a survey of unhappy families, you’d be hard pressed to find one quite so spectacularly savage as the Goodyews of Kent. In Louise Dean’s darkly comic new novel, “The Old Romantic,” Nick Goodyew, an English solicitor specializing in divorce, hasn’t seen his father, Ken, in 15 years, his mother, Pearl, in over 20 — since Nick more or less broke up the family by revealing his father’s infidelities, then escaped to the loftier world of Cambridge. When Ken gets back in touch after years of silence, it’s largely to heap abuse on his son — “Oy! Big’ead! . . . You’re nothing! You’re a stuck-up, jumped-up . . . embarrassment” — before admitting that he’ll be requiring Nick’s services in divorcing his second wife, a squat, tittering woman whose banal chatter Ken likens to a “dripping tap.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/books/review/Brownrigg-t.html

SoHo Think Tank, the company that ran the Ohio, an Off Off Broadway theater at 66 Wooster Street, for almost 20 years, will have a new home at the Archive Building at 154 Christopher Street in the West Village beginning this fall.

It will produce its annual Ice Factory festival there this summer before moving in September to the new 73-seat theater, where it will reopen under a subsidized 10-year lease and a new name, Ohio West. “To be back in our own space within a year of leaving Wooster Street, and to be in the West Village, no less, is just unbelievable,” said the company’s artistic director, Robert Lyons, above.

Not so, according to Pat McGrath, who created the look and also employed silver at Valentino and Galliano. “Metallics are unique, modern and chic,” she says. “But most of all, they are completely wearable on every skin tone.” For an evening out, she suggests using Laura Mercier’s intense Foiled Eye Color in V.I.P. Silver on the lid, keeping the color centered, rather than extending up to the brow, and following with black liquid liner and mascara. For day, try Covergirl Smoky ShadowBlast in Silver Sky from the lash line to the browbone, and finish with two coats of mascara. Romy Soleimani, who created the liquid mercury look for this story, recommends a sheer wash of Make Up For Ever Aqua Cream No. 3 all over the lid and in the crease, followed by mascara. “Fill in your brow, do a beautiful pale pink lip, and you have a delicate version of the look,” she says.

He is well known for his portraits of actors and musicians and his fashion work for magazines, among them Vanity Fair and Italian Vogue. “Listen” displays a natural feeling for things that hover between ordinary and monumental, sad and self-renewing.

Aimed at men who want to purchase clothes, accessories and other dapper goods online, Mr. Porter is a stand-alone destination, not an add-on to its sister site. “We started from scratch,” said Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net-a-Porter. “We didn’t want to simply include a men’s tab on Net-a-Porter.” Massenet hired the former British Esquire editor Jeremy Langmead and a team of experienced men’s-wear editors to tailor the editorial content (style advice, guides and portfolios of non-models like the poet Nick Laird, above) for an audience that is generally held to be more interested in connoisseurship than in passing fads. Not surprisingly, the site will carry classic establishment brands like Ralph Lauren and Dunhill as well as harder-to-find heritage labels like Lock & Co. and Swayne Adeney Brigg. Its handsome black and white packaging will ship to 170 countries, proving that for stylish men, even e-commerce is all about the details.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/the-site-makes-the-man/

2011-02-24,Bieber Dominates Billboard Chart,"Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum all got big “Grammy lifts” — the typical boost in record sales after the awards show. But who had the biggest lift depends on how you look at the numbers. Mr. Bieber, who did not win any awards but who had a prominent performing slot at the ceremony, dominates this week’s Billboard album chart. “Never Say Never: The Remixes” (Island), the soundtrack to his new 3-D concert film, opened at No. 1 with 161,000 copies sold. But just as impressive, he has three other albums in the Top 40: “My World 2.0” is No. 8, “My Worlds Acoustic” is No. 18, and “My World,” the mini-album that was his debut, is No. 31. Billboard said Mr. Bieber was the first artist to pull off that feat since Garth Brooks in 1993. The British alt-folk band Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum, the country-pop trio that went home with the most Grammy awards (five, including record and song of the year), also had good runs on the album chart. Mumford & Sons’ “Sigh No More” (Glassnote) holds at No. 2 this week. Its rise to No. 2 from No. 11 last week was largely based on impulse buys made during the Grammys telecast, on which the group performed with Bob Dylan, with 133,000 sales, a 169 percent increase from the week before. Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” (Capitol Nashville) is No. 4, with 85,000 sales, a 205 percent gain. (No. 3 this week goes to Vol. 37 of the series “Now That’s What I Call Music!,” which sold 95,000.) In terms of digital downloads, however, Lady Gaga and Cee Lo Green came out way ahead. “Born This Way,” which Lady Gaga performed at the awards, sold 509,000 copies in its first full week on sale, bringing its total sales in the United States — in just 10 days — to 957,000. And sales of Cee Lo’s “____ You” jumped 178 percent, to 412,000.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/bieber-dominates-billboard-chart/
2011-02-24,Enigmatic Choreographer Tells an Enigmatic Tale,"The choreographer Paul Taylor  one of the few living artists who have made classics by which our age should be remembered  is a puzzle, and means to be. He makes works whose rhythms answer that of their music, except sometimes they carry on regardless. He makes dances that are primarily about dancing, except that in many of them he seems preoccupied by more specific subject matter. His pieces are addressed to the audience in a way that speaks of entertainment (bright, harsh or both) and yet frequently they do things that will make audiences think, “We should be entertained by that?” His company’s repertory has become so large  his latest is listed as Opus No. 133  that each year brings a major revival of at least one important work that hasn’t been seen in decades. It contains many other pieces that get revived only fleetingly before being returned to cold storage for several more seasons. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/arts/dance/24gala.html

2011-02-24,"Moviegoing Leaps, Except in North America","International moviegoing soared in 2010, but the North American market started to show more signs of trouble, according to an annual survey released on Wednesday by the Motion Picture Association of America. Total box office receipts for all films released around the world climbed to $31.8 billion, an 8 percent increase over 2009. But overseas ticket sales contributed all of the increase, as sales in North America were flat for a second year, at $10.6 billion, despite a boom in sales of higher-priced 3-D tickets. “The Chinese box office market is just going gangbusters,” said Bob Pisano, president and interim chief executive of the movie association. The association does not report overseas attendance figures; admissions in North America fell 5 percent, to 1.34 billion. In a development that Mr. Pisano called “not so encouraging” the number of North American admissions per capita fell to 4.1, the lowest level since 1993, from 4.3 in 2009. Mr. Pisano said he was unsure of the reason, but added, “We’ve got to get more Americans and Canadians back to the movie theaters.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/movies/24arts-MOVIEGOINGLE_BRF.html

Press representatives for the revival said on Thursday that Mr. Jones will play Arthur Hockstader, a Truman-esque chief executive deciding between endorsing the potential presidential nominees William Russell and Joe Cantwell. When “The Best Man” was first presented on Broadway in 1960 (and made into a film in 1964), Russell was perceived as an analogue for Adlai Stevenson and Cantwell as an amalgam of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon; a 2000 Broadway revival, starring Charles Durning as Hockstader, Spalding Gray as Russell and Chris Noth as Cantwell, seemed to have its eye on the real-life contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Michael Wilson (“The Orphans’ Home Cycle”) will direct the 2012 production, though its producers have not yet announced their nominees to play Russell and Cantwell.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/james-earl-jones-elected-for-broadway-revival-of-gore-vidals-the-best-man/

They were caught by guards at the site, he said, comparing the thieves to the people who looted the Egyptian Museum on Jan. 28.

Sciame. In a letter to Ms. Pelzer that he shared with The New York Times, the former president, Peter Stanford, said that the museum needed new leadership to survive. He wrote that Ms. Pelzer’s and Mr. Sciame’s credibility had been damaged by “concealment” of its financial problems, and that the “overall direction of the Seaport Museum has been neglectful of its principal physical asset,” its historic ships. Mr. Sciame, a real estate developer, has lent the museum $3 million in the last year to cover operating expenses. “Mr. Sciame and Ms. Pelzer are extremely surprised and deeply disappointed by these inaccurate comments,” said Adam Pockriss of Rubenstein Communications and a spokesman for the museum.

State Representative Scott Raecker introduced the bill this month as a way to create an endowment to pay for as many as 1,000 full student scholarships a year, but the proposal drew widespread criticism. David Miles, the president of the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, described the bill as “a profoundly bad idea,” one that was examined by the board in 2008 and “determined to be not in the best interests of the University of Iowa or the state.” Mr. Raecker told the student newspaper The Daily Iowan that he still believed the painting should be sold but said that the issue had become “so polarized that reaching consensus is unlikely.” “I’m a firm believer in the legislative process,” he added, “and further discussion of the sale of the Pollock painting will not be moved forward in the legislature this year.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/bill-requiring-the-university-of-iowa-to-relinquish-pollocks-mural-is-dropped/

As the lawyers say, “Cases are decided not on the truth but on the evidence.” With no fear of prosecution, my patients’ caregivers had no motive to lie.

So her next role is a bit of a departure, and not only because she isn’t called upon to swing her fists. In the boxing video game Fight Night Champion, which EA Sports will release for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation3 consoles on Tuesday, Ms. Dushku plays the daughter of an unscrupulous fight promoter, and finds herself drawn into an intrigue involving her father and an up-and-coming boxer (played by the actor and athlete LaMonica Garrett). The story, which is told in movie-style sequences that unfold between the game’s playable boxing matches, is written by Will Rokos, an Academy Award-nominated writer and producer of “Monster’s Ball,” and represents the latest effort to bridge the worlds of gaming and cinema. These sequences (which were created using 3-D motion-capture technology) also allowed Ms. Dushku to play a character who was very much herself and yet as unearthly as anything seen on a Joss Whedon show.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/the-lady-is-a-champ-eliza-dushku-goes-a-few-rounds-with-fight-night-champion/

2011-02-25,Rough Boys,"One Saturday night in the mid-’70s, I stood on the deck of a shabby duplex watching my teenage boyfriend — a character who could have walked out of the pages of Andre Dubus III’s powerful new memoir, “Townie” — beat another boy senseless in the parking lot below. Under the yellowish dusk-to-dawn lights, I could see my boyfriend’s blond sideburns, denim jacket and dingo boots, and I could see him punch the boy in the stomach until he crumpled to the ground, then kick him over and over until his nose and lips were split and bleeding. In “Townie,” which details Dubus’s 1970s coming-of-age in the poor mill towns of Massachusetts, there are none of the usual signifiers of today’s ’70s Nostalgia Industrial Complex, no peace-sign key chains or smiley-face T-shirts, none of the goofy stoners and ditsy girls in tube tops that American television viewers have become accustomed to on “That ’70s Show.” Instead, Dubus writes about “the apartments” where his older sister buys drugs, two rows of three-story buildings surrounded by packed dirt worn smooth, a Dumpster in back always filled with dirty diapers, used condoms and pizza boxes. He writes about an early manifestation of “Fight Club” culture at his school, where, whenever there is a fight, boys and girls rush to one spot “like they were being pulled there by the air itself. . . . Kids were yelling: ‘Kill him! Kill him!’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Steinke-t.html

Historically, African-Americans with identifiably dark skin have had only two choices when confronting racial discrimination and oppression: either they could try to ease their burden through accommodation, making the best of a bad situation, or they could engage in protest and active resistance. The situation was often quite different, however, for light-skinned African-Americans of mixed parentage.

During a drunken revel characteristic of the rough Macedonian court, an Athenian woman named Thais, the mistress of one of the high officers present, made a startling suggestion. It would be a fine thing, she said, if with her own hands and with Alexander looking on, she set fire to the palace built by King Xerxes, who a century and a half earlier had reduced her home city to ashes, “that it might be recorded to posterity that the women who followed Alexander had taken a severer revenge on the Persians for the sufferings and affronts of Greece, than all the famed commanders had been able to do by sea or land.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Coates-t.html

Emily Vidal’s father, Victor, an investment banker, is celebrating his 50th birthday. Most visible, among the hundreds of guests: Victor’s angry and acerbic wife, Gloria, and Victor’s mistress, Mrs. Res­nick, who lives next door with her reclusive husband.

2011-02-25,Stormy Weather,"Like Eddie (Rochester) Anderson in “Cabin in the Sky,” the 1943 movie-musical parable of temptation, most Americans seem constitutionally predisposed to choose Lena Horne over Ethel Waters — that is, to prefer a model of classical beauty, sex appeal, excitement and youth to a symbol of matronly stolidity, virtue and middle-age languor. Anderson comes around to Waters, of course, when a team of celestial Simon Cowells repackages her to show that the old lady still has loads of talent, vigor and carnality in reserve. Nearly 70 years later, American culture has grown so absorbed with beauty and youthfulness that the film’s vindication of ability over appearance, depth and experience over novelty and thrills, seems even more wishfully fantastical than it was in 1943. Meanwhile, the movie’s top-billed star, Ethel Waters, has been nearly forgotten by all but enthusiasts of music and movie history.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Hajdu-t.html

2011-02-25,Becoming Ottoman,"The promising opening chapters of Michael David Lukas’s first novel, “The Oracle of Stamboul,” have many of the appealing features of a fairy tale. A girl of unusual gifts is born in fulfillment of a prophecy, and after her mother dies giving birth, she is raised by a loving but weak-willed father and an oppressive stepmother, while a mysterious flock of birds follows her wherever she goes. But the girl, Eleonora Cohen, is also a Jew born into a specific historical context — the Ottoman Empire in the late-19th century — and on the day of her birth in 1877, her hometown, the Romanian port of Constanta on the Black Sea, is sacked by the Russian cavalry. This juxtaposition of fable and brute history tells us right from the start that we’re in the realm of magic realism, and the story’s tension, or lack thereof, between magic and realism is an indication of both the ambition and the shortcomings of this ultimately frustrating novel.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Hynes-t.html

He’s the sort of guy who borrows civilians’ cars with all the hesitation of a teenage shoplifter, who’ll club the skull of a useful drug dealer who’s already comfortably trussed in the back of an Econoline. When a beefy thug on a pier in Cyprus dismisses him with an ostentatious yawn, Wells quickly takes him to task, dumping him into Zygi's oily harbor.

2011-02-25,With or Without You,"One of literature’s most seductive questions was asked by the Hungarian novelist Sandor Marai in “Embers,” his exquisite novel of friendship and betrayal, published in Budapest in 1942, but not translated into English until 2001, 12 years after his death. “Do you want it to be the way it used to be?” a woman asks a man. “Yes,” he responds.“Exactly the same. The way it was last time.” This exchange occurs not between lovers but between a 91-year-old servant and the 75-year-old general she nursed as a baby, in whose household she has remained. The general wants her to set up the dining room just as it looked at his life’s most critical juncture, 41 years earlier, when the closest, most sacred friendship of his youth came to an end.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

The book was Khanna’s version of the fall of the West and the rise of the rest. Having described this grave new world, Khanna now wants to tell us how to run it.

Khemiri offers familiar if not simple emotional territory, a story about a son and his estranged father — complicated by questions of culture and language, racism and violence, metafiction and postmodernity, formal conceit and constraint.

But Jacoby is no Mr. Spock. Her rationalism is delivered in an angry barrage peppered with enthusiastically snide asides. In previous books, including “The Age of American Unreason” and “Freethinkers,” her targets have been right-leaning religionists, social Darwinists, and the paucity of reason in a generation that stares too much at glowing screens and too little at learned books. In her latest jeremiad, “Never Say Die,” she fights to slay the conspiracies of ignorance and greed that she believes conceal a single, and indeed irrefutable, truth: extreme old age can be nasty, brutish and long.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/books/review/Fishman-t.html

Several Libyan navy ships were ordered to bombard the city of Benghazi, which has been liberated by rebels. The ships’ officers don’t want to do that and don’t like Qaddafi, and they’re also fearful that if they attack Benghazi they’ll be attacked right back by shore batteries. They would like to make a run for Malta and defect, but they fear that the Libyan air force is watching them and will bomb them if they head in that direction. And the commanding officers also aren’t entirely sure who on board is trustworthy and who isn’t.

2011-02-28,Recalling a Revered Singer in Harlem,"The mezzo-soprano Betty Allen was part of a generation of pioneering black female vocal artists who emerged triumphantly in the 1950s and ’60s, a select group of greats including Leontyne Price, Shirley Verrett and Grace Bumbry. If Ms. Allen never achieved the status or the public renown of her sister singers, she was a distinguished performer who combined a rich voice with musical integrity and scrupulous diction; a devotee of American music; and a favorite of composers as varied as Virgil Thomson, Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein. As a conductor Bernstein recruited her often to sing with the New York Philharmonic. Yet she may have had her greatest influence as an educator who taught for decades at the Manhattan School of Music and directed the Harlem School of the Arts during 13 high-growth years, becoming its president emeritus in 1993.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/arts/music/28betty.html

Meanwhile, Milan’s obsession with the movies this season persists. The music for Missoni this afternoon came from “True Romance” and “Natural Born Killers,” and the chaotic, pastel clothes brought to mind Juliette Lewis, though not specifically her character in the Oliver Stone film. The mood was girlish innocence verging to girlish wreck, with long silk-print and knit dresses, impressively fat cardigans, and maxi coats in multi-hued python. The colors seem to flood from a girl’s bedroom, or the bathrooms of a 1960s subdivision: baby yellow, mint green, pink, and violet. Angela Missoni threw them together, sometimes causing one to cringe (example: a crinkly violet knit pants outfit with a sick twinkle of Lurex). It was strong and little perverse, thanks to the pastel upchuck. The accessories also pointed to bad movie girls: floppy knit caps and adorable motorcycle boots in a collage of python and colors.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/in-milan-a-movie-obsession-and-a-1960s-tilt/

He also shared the César for best adapted screenplay with Robert Harris, while the film also captured awards for best editing and best score.

2011-02-28,A Mixed Bag of a Cultural Mash-Up,"LOS ANGELES — So how did the Academy Awards do as a cultural mash-up? Not so hot. Though the hosts, James Franco and Anne Hathaway, joked about being the “hip” Oscars from the start of the show and then acted on it — Mr. Franco unleashed a torrent of backstage Twitter posts, and Ms. Hathaway mentioned drinking games — their performance drew decidedly mixed reviews, especially when compared with the riffing of the 94-year-old Kirk Douglas. The “Auto-Tune the News” segment was a bit of a head-scratcher. And the use of the fifth-grade choir from Staten Island’s P.S. 22, a YouTube sensation known for its renditions of pop and indie songs, was denuded by singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” as the credits rolled. Don’t get us wrong, it was still cute (and the shot of Melissa Leo singing along was sweet, especially after she dropped an obscenity in her remarks accepting her Supporting Actress Oscar).

Most of you have probably spent a significant chunk of time carrying out this mundane activity, maybe a few months of your entire life when it’s all added up.

Not done right, they can trip you up or deprive you of an Olympic medal, as might have happened to the notorious ice-skater Tonya Harding in 1994. Nowadays, shoemakers use newfangled ways to make shoes secure, such as velcro fasteners or new space-age materials that need no fasteners at all. To us puzzle lovers, shoelaces provide a wealth of combinatorial delights. So I thought it was worth getting this puzzle out before shoelaces disappear entirely.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/numberplay-lacing-it-up/
