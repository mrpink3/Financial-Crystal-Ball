The new headquarters for District 7 of Caltrans, the California Transportation Authority, in downtown Los Angeles, above, was designed by the Los Angeles firm Morphosis, headed by Thom Mayne.

The roof of the new south campus of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena has skylights, above right, of a tough filmlike material called Foiltec, with patterns by the graphic designer Bruce Mau. Morphosis is in the running to help turn eight acres in downtown Los Angeles -- home to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Rafael Moneo's Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Museum of Contemporary Art -- into an entertainment, retail and residential center.

The disease is caused by a protein, called a prion, that folds itself into an abnormal shape. When a misfolded prion comes into contact with a healthy prion, it can cause the healthy proteins to misfold. ''We are concerned that there is limited coordination among the crucial components of a national research program around the prevention, surveillance and study of prion disease,'' the lawmakers wrote to Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, organized the effort.

The judge, William T. Chandler of the Delaware Chancery Court, made the ruling Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana. The suit said that the dividend might force Regal into bankruptcy while enriching Regal's controlling shareholder and director, the billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, by $368 million. In his ruling the judge said that none of the fund's claims had merit. At issue in the lawsuit was whether Regal's assets were greater than its liabilities, because Delaware law requires that a company must have a surplus to declare a dividend. Stuart Grant, a lawyer for the teachers system, said the fund might sue to recover the dividend for the corporation.

2004-06-03,Report May Have Hastened Tenet's Resignation," WASHINGTON, June 3 - George J. Tenet's resignation may have been hastened by a critical, 400-page report from the Senate intelligence committee that was presented to the Central Intelligence Agency for comment last month. Government officials and people close to Mr. Tenet said the classified report is a detailed account of mistakes and miscalculations by American intelligence agencies on the question of whether Iraq possessed illicit weapons before last year's invasion by the United States. An unclassified version of the report is to be made public later this month. Some close to Mr. Tenet say the report was among the factors that led him to step down from a post he had considered leaving for several years. Officials who have read the report described it as presenting an across-the-board indictment of the C.I.A.'s performance on Iraq. They said its criticisms ranged from inadequate prewar collection of intelligence by spies and satellites to a sloppy analytical peformance, often based on uncorroborated sources, that produced the mistaken conclusion that Iraq possessed biological and chemical weapons. ""There are some things that are indefensible,"" said a recently retired intelligence official familiar with the report. ""There are some real errors, of omission and commission, and it's not going to be a pretty picture."" A congressional official declined to comment on the tone or specific content of the report, but said: ""Our intention has been to be as detailed and as thorough as possible, and we've been very specific."" The version of the report that was shared with the C.I.A. included only factual findings, not the separate conclusions that are still being worked out by Democrats and Republicans on the Republican-controlled panel, government officials said. But the findings alone were portrayed by three separate officials as likely to be particularly embarrassing to the C.I.A., whose analysts were the main proponents within the intelligence community of the view that Iraq possessed illicit weapons. To date, Mr. Tenet and his agency have insisted that it is too soon to say whether the C.I.A. made mistakes in its prewar assessment. But even before Mr. Tenet announced his resignation, the committee chairman, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, said at a breakfast meeting on Thursday that he believed the intelligence community was still ""in denial"" on the issue. Richard J. Kerr, a former deputy director of central intelligence who has been leading the C.I.A.'s own internal review of its performance, said in an interview that he had not read the Senate report. But he said he believed it had been a factor in Mr. Tenet's decision to step down. ""This has been a very rough go,"" Mr. Kerr said, citing the criticism during Mr. Tenet's tenure of the agency's performance on other issues, including the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, the subject of another forthcoming report, by an independent presidential commission, which is due to be released next month. The reports by the Senate committee and the Sept. 11 commission ""are going to be very critical"" of Mr. Tenet and his agency, Mr. Kerr said. ""I think he was at a point where he thought maybe it was better that he was no longer the person up front on this."" Until early this week, congressional officials said, Mr. Tenet had been tentatively scheduled to appear before the Senate committee in a closed session on Thursday, in what would have amounted to a final rebuttal before the report was released. The officials said that Mr. Tenet had cancelled that appearance, citing other committments but giving no hint that he was preparing to step down. A senior intelligence official said that the C.I.A., which has the power to decide how much of the classified report can be released in unclassified form, was expected to complete its review soon. One senior government official who works outside the C.I.A. and who has seen the report described it as prosecutorial in tone. ""This is not what you'd call a balanced, analytical document,"" said the official, who is not normally an ally of Mr. Tenet. ""It's very, very harsh."" Mr. Tenet and President Bush both said Thursday that Mr. Tenet's reasons for leaving were personal, and others close to Mr. Tenet endorsed that account. Some, including David Boren, the former Democratic senator from Oklahoma who was Mr. Tenet's mentor on Capitol Hill, emphatically denied that the forthcoming Senate report or the one by the Sept. 11 commission had anything to do with the resignation. But in anticipation of the report, Senator Roberts, the intelligence committee chairman, had by Thursday morning adopted a newly critical tone toward the intelligence agencies that Mr. Tenet oversees. ""Simply put, I think the community is somewhat in denial,"" Senator Roberts said at a breakfast meeting, at which he also called for ""fresh thinking"" within the intelligence community. A joint statement issued later by Senator Roberts and his Democratic counterpart, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, praised Mr. Tenet for his contributions but also called attention to to the stormy environment in which he was departing. ""While he steps down during a period of controversy over events leading up to the attacks of 9/11 and the quality of intelligence prior to the Iraq War, we should not lose sight of a simple truth: George Tenet has served his country with distinction and honor during difficult and demanding times,"" the two senators said in the statement. Among the particular criticisms that government officials said were spelled out in the classified version of the Senate report were the failure of the C.I.A. to develop human sources of intelligence within Saddam Hussein's government before the war. As late as 2002, intelligence officials have acknowledged, American intelligence agencies could count on no more than four informants within the Iraqi government. The report is also critical of what is described as the C.I.A.'s heavy reliance on foreign governments for intelligence about Iraq, including sources who were never interviewed by American intelligence agencies and whose veracity is now doubted. Among those sources were one known as ""Curveball,"" who was introduced to German intelligence by the Iraqi National Congress, a group headed by Ahmad Chalabi, and who was cited in American intelligence reports as the primary basis for what now appears to be the mistaken assertion that Iraq had mobile laboratories for the manufacture of biological weapons. The report also calls attention to what one official called ""slipshod work"" and ""factual errors"" by C.I.A. analysts and operations officials, including cases in which single sources of intelligence were identified as multiple sources, and in which at least one warning that identified a source of intelligence as a fabricator was ignored. The information provided by the fabricator - that Iraq possessed mobile biological laboratories - found its way into Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's presentation last February to the United Nations Security Council making administration's case for war. In a speech earlier this year, Mr. Tenet acknowledged in general terms the mishandling of the notification about the fabricator, who was also linked to the Iraqi National Congress. Other intelligence officials, also in general terms, have acknowledged mistakes involving a single source being listed by various names, so that the accounts were presented as corrroborating one another. But government officials who have read the Senate report said it spells out many more mistakes and does so in abundant detail.

Lautenbach died Wednesday in Bedford Hills, NY. He was 65. He died of heart failure, according to his family. He was with his nephew, Marc Lautenbach, at the time of his death. Born August 10, 1938, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Lautenbach was the second son of the late Frances Herbert and Robert Charles Lautenbach. Mr. Lautenbach graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati in 1959 and joined IBM that same year. Mr. Lautenbach and his wife, Carole, moved to Darien in 1974, where they raised their six daughters. He held a variety of senior executive positions while at IBM. When he retired in 1992, he was a senior vice president and a member of the four-person IBM Management Committee. He oversaw a large part of IBM's operations, including its U.S. sales force and its worldwide manufacturing and development. He held a number of marketing and management posts during his rise to become the youngest president of the data processing division in 1976. Afterward, he served in a series of senior positions in the United States and internationally, including chairman IBM Americas, Far East, and Group Executive Information Systems and Communication Group. Mr. Lautenbach left a strong legacy at IBM. Retired IBM Chairman and CEO, John Opel, said of Mr. Lautenbach ''Terry has an extremely bright and quick intellect matched with his sensitive good humor and energy that gave him the ability to be excellent in everything he pursued -- family, business, career and social and civic endeavors--every place he added value. We all wanted him on our team.'' Part of Mr. Lautenbach's legacy included contributions to the advancement of women and African Americans at IBM. Ted Childs, IBM vice president, said of Mr. Lautenbach, ''Terry was committed to all people and ensured that everyone has a fair chance. He hated intolerance and injustice and had a profound impact on my career and ability to do the work that I do at IBM.'' Mr. Lautenbach was also an active member of the Darien community, serving as president of the board of trustees of the Darien Library, Campaign Chairman for the Darien United Way, and on his church council. After retiring from IBM, Mr. Lautenbach moved to Sanibel, Fla., but continued to visit Darien frequently. Mr. Lautenbach remained active after his retirement, serving as a director on various corporate boards, including Varian Medical Systems, CVS, Footstar, Air Products, and Loomis Sayles. Mr. Lautenbach was also an avid golfer and a founding member and first president of the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, Fla. While known primarily as a leader in the business world, Mr. Lautenbach was most proud of his family, both immediate and extended. He was a beloved husband, father and grandfather known to his thirteen grandchildren as Poppop. He was at his happiest when surrounded by as many family members as possible. Mr. Lautenbach is survived by his wife of 44 years, Carole; his six daughters, Jennifer Streeter of Darien, Conn., Susan Bates, Julie Maxman, Martha Lautenbach, Mary Lautenbach, and Anne Stern of Atlanta, Ga.; three brothers, Ned Lautenbach, Dan Lautenbach, Jim Lautenbach and one sister, Cynthia Chappell. Mr. Lautenbach's oldest brother, Thom, is deceased. Mr. Lautenbach is also survived by his thirteen grandchildren and four godsons.

These unheralded women make rare public appearances in a new show by the comedy duo Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney. The scene below, taken from ''Afterbirth: Kathy and Mo's Greatest Hits,'' imagines a support group for Disney moms. Ms. Najimy and Ms. Gaffney -- or Kathy and Mo, as they are billed -- had their first major New York theater production in 1986 with ''The Further Adventures of Kathy and Mo'' at Second Stage Theater. Since then, they have filmed two HBO specials and also worked separately in movies and television. ''Afterbirth'' is a collection of some of their more popular sketches, plus two new scenes, including this one. The show, directed by Mark Brokaw, begins a monthlong run at Second Stage on Friday.

Caroming from one cad to another, she grows used to ''men who wear mascara in between eyelash dyes'' and tell their girlfriends how to dress to go shopping at Whole Foods. ''I was starting to think that if I had to kiss one more freak,'' she wails, ''I might not make it through.'' And yet, in the opinion of Drew Vance, who tackles a conquest in the elevator of a doorman building in THE RIGHT ADDRESS (Broadway, $21.95), a bitchy and brittle Park Avenue fable by Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman, a kiss remains ''a good way to pass the time.''

2004-06-07,PAGEANT TO BE SHORTENED,"The Miss America Organization and ABC-TV have agreed to shorten the Miss America Pageant broadcast this fall to two hours from three. The network cited shrinking ratings for the pageant in recent years as the reason for the move. The pageant has been televised for three hours since 1998 and had switched between two and a half and three hours for several years before that. Last year, the pageant made a $1.7 million profit on the broadcast, but since advertising revenue will shrink because of the truncated broadcast, it is expected to make less money this year, when it is shown on Sept. 18. The show will be the 50th broadcast of the pageant, which started in 1921 as a gimmick to extend the summer season in Atlantic City by a few weeks.

2004-06-07,Sonic Youth's Latest Summer Soundtrack,"MARIA RITA -- One peril of contemporary Brazilian pop is that though the singers may be sublime and the songwriting at a high level, there's a strange disconnection about backup bands. It's rare to find a performance going on behind a singer that sounds relaxed and organic, like a working band rather than a pile of studio musicians' excited contributions. The young singer Maria Rita happens to be the daughter of Elis Regina, one of Brazil's greatest pop stars in the 60's and 70's, and her first album, ''Maria Rita'' (Warner Music Latina), proves an exception. It's produced by Tom Capone, who recorded Ms. Rita and her acoustic band live in the studio, with nicely clanky details and open space in the sound. They switch happily from samba to Afro-Cuban rhythm to ballads to funk, using great songwriters, and Ms. Rita's lithe, small voice warms the mix without her mother's nervous edge. The album has become a hit in Brazil, and rightly so.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/arts/music-playlist-sonic-youth-s-latest-summer-soundtrack.html

As he departed, he told a reporter he wanted to sit down and relax with a glass of wine and a blank sheet of paper. This was perhaps not so true: it's hard to imagine Joy with a blank sheet of paper. Thoughts and ideas pile up furiously in his notebooks; diagrams and scribbles and equations issue forth at all hours of the day and night. When Joy, 49, finally moved out of a small Sun office in downtown Aspen, where he had worked since the late 1980's, he had to archive 900 pounds of professional papers.

As the sergeant comes across the courtroom in the morning, the defendant will know why and, barely pausing in his chitchat with his lawyer, lift his hands together in the gesture of a begging dog. When outsiders attend trials, hoping for a glimpse of something true, they peek at the defendant and are often disappointed with the picture of a man who is totally relaxed, in fact a little bored with his own defendantness.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/throwing-away-the-key.html

2004-06-07,'Rounding the Horn'," On a sparkling, warm, atypical day in March, we shouldered up our gear and headed down the hill to the harbor at Ushuaia, Argentina. It's deep enough to accommodate oceangoing freighters at wharves fronting Avenue Mupai. But the west end, where the sailboats live, is mud-bank shallow at low tide when the moon is new or full. This morning's low had left the concrete wharf high and dry except for a shallow pool at the outer end, where Pelagic and three of her colleagues were rafted beam-to-beam, barely afloat. Pelagic was the outermost boat in the raft. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/books/chapters/rounding-the-horn.html

In their recent letter to financial markets in which they lay out the ground rules for their public-share offering, the company's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, insist that Rule No.1 will be ''Don't be evil.'' This, they seem to think, will strike their audience as a radical idea. That is because the audience consists, mainly, of investors.

After his installation, scheduled for July 6, Bishop Serratelli will preside over a New Jersey diocese that includes about 388,000 Catholics in 111 parishes in Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties. Bishop Serratelli is a biblical scholar who grew up in Newark and became a seminary professor and skilled speaker. He has served for the last two years as the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Newark, the highest-ranking post under Archbishop John J. Myers, who has said that elected officials who favor abortion rights should not take communion. During a news conference, when asked if he favored denying communion to such officials, Bishop Serratelli said that a committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops was studying that matter and that it would be premature to offer his views until the committee issues a report. But he added, ''I have a sense, and it's only a personal sense, that most bishops are not thinking of making the altar a place of confrontation.''

The television series ''Alias'' notwithstanding, you can be pretty sure that gizmos of mass destruction are not always stored in the immediate vicinity of spectacularly glamorous parties.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/books/the-last-word-smiley-s-people.html

2004-06-07,What The Bagel Man Saw,"Once upon a time, Paul F. dreamed big dreams. While studying agricultural economics at Cornell, he wanted to end world hunger. Instead, after doctoral work at M.I.T., he wound up taking a job with a research institute in Washington, analyzing the weapons expenditures of the United States Navy. This was in 1962. After four years came more of the same: analyst jobs with the Bureau of the Budget, the Institute for Defense Analyses, the President's Commission on Federal Statistics. Still, he dreamed. He had ''potent research ideas,'' as he recalls them now, which the Environmental Protection Agency failed to appreciate. He developed a statistical means of predicting cancer clusters, but because he was an economist and not a doctor, he couldn't make headway with the National Cancer Institute. He still loved the art of economics -- the data-gathering, the statistical manipulation, the problem-solving -- but it had led him to a high-level dead end. He was well paid and unfulfilled. ''I'd go to the office Christmas party, and people would introduce me to their wives or husbands as the guy who brings in the bagels,'' he says. '''Oh! You're the guy who brings in the bagels!' Nobody ever said, 'This is the guy in charge of the public research group.'''",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/what-the-bagel-man-saw.html

My eye wandered to an Asian-style risotto of lobster and black truffles. Irresistible, so why resist? -- although $34 was pushing the upper limit on what was, when you got down to it, a glorified bar menu.

2004-06-07,A Long Way Down,"You could hear the corrections officer jingle his chain and turn his heavy Folger Adam key in the lock before the door swung open and Jay Jones came walking into the visiting room. It's a big space with a lot of chairs but no exterior windows, so Jones had no way of knowing the sun shone brightly outside and high-up clouds were drifting over the grassland west of Oklahoma City. Dressed in forest-green pants and shirt, with white socks and black shoes, he looked more like the guy who comes to fix your dishwasher than an inmate of a federal institution. This was the Transfer Center of the United States Bureau of Prisons, the transportation hub for thousands of state and federal convicts passing through each year on their way from one prison to another. Jones was part of the ''cadre,'' or group of inmates who dish up the meals, cut the grass and generally keep the facility running. I had last seen him six months before, on June 30, 2003, in an upscale subdivision south of Tulsa where he wished goodbye to his wife and his daughter and his son-in-law standing on the steps of their house. He had changed considerably since then. His ruddy face had acquired the proverbial jailhouse pallor; he was down about 20 pounds, owing to his distaste for prison food.

2004-06-07,The Price Of Parsimony,"My anxiety about spending money reared up one day when I was walking down the aisles of a C-Town in the Bronx. I was a few years into the fieldwork for a book I was writing on inner-city poverty, living on less than a quarter of the salary I'd earned at my last proper job. That afternoon, I was trailing my book's main subject, Lolli, as she bought the month's groceries. She was a teenager, pregnant, homeless and already the mother of two children. Her young family subsisted on food stamps and vouchers from the federal subsidy program, WIC. The shield of my judgment rose when she passed right by the C-Town weekly discount flier and made her way down the dirty aisles with her shopping cart. She just grabbed things -- packs of chicken legs and pork chops, bags of sugar and rice, bottles of vegetable oil; in went cans of beans and tins of Spam. I stood, stunned, as she reached for the individual-portion cartons of juice -- with their brightly colored miniature straws -- ignoring the larger, economy-size bottles. No calculation of unit price, no can'ts or shoulds or ought-not-to's, no keen eye to the comparative ounce. By the time her stuffed cart reached the checkout line, my unease was turning into anger.

His singular commitment to the performing arts, and especially his deep appreciation and joyous pleasure in experiencing the beauty and wonder of opera, has been an inspiration to our Company. Richard Colburn's generous leadership support as a Founding Angel, through the Colburn Foundation and as a Domingo Angel enabled Los Angeles Opera to reach higher levels of artistic achievements each season and grow into an internationally acclaimed major opera house. Richard Colburn leaves a legacy of vision in philanthropy and the arts. He will be remembered especially for his personal energy, his prodigious knowledge of music and musicians, and his passion for excellence in performance. An accomplished violist himself, Richard had a deep appreciation for musicians and their accomplishments. He was a memorable presence in the opera house where he particularly relished opening nights, premieres and other festive evenings. We will miss his quiet encouragement from the first row at each performance he attended and the unusual rapport he had with our musicians and other members of the Company. We will miss his wise counsel during challenging times and his irreverent wit in even the most difficult of circumstances. His unabated enjoyment of his involvement with Los Angeles Opera, his extraordinary philanthropy and most of all his abiding friendships within our Board and Company set an example that will inspire music lovers in future generations. He will be deeply missed by all who were privileged to know him as a friend. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Lisa Colburn and to his family. Marc I. Stern, Chairman and C.E.O. Frank E.

Tanning is a dirty and bloody business, but it's honorable and ancient: The apostle Paul was a tanner, a fact undoubtedly pointed out repeatedly by Jesse's devout and dour Methodist wife, Hannah. Hannah Simpson was a strong-willed Pennsylvania woman who believed that work could save souls and who told people (apparently with some repetition) that she wanted to live ""unspotted from the world."" People noted that she meant what she said.

''A sea mist hangs over this age-old tale,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here. ''Alexander dispels it, to the reader's fascination.''",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/books/new-noteworthy.html

The shows will be advertised as ''The Bowery Presents,'' and a new sound system will be installed, said John Moore, who books the Bowery. Webster Hall will be available for bookings seven nights a week, he said, although its late-night dancing on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays means that any other concerts will have to end by 11:30 p.m., resulting in strange meetings of rock and dance fans on their way in and out, already a common occurrence there.

Just after midnight, the inmate, Anthony Borelli, 37, fell six floors from the ward where he had been held since April 27, according to the spokesman, Thomas Antenen. Mr. Borelli had removed an air-conditioner from a wall in a room where he and several other inmates were staying. He went out the slot for the air-conditioner and was climbing down using a rope made of strips of torn bedsheets when the rope apparently broke, Mr. Antenen said. A section of the rope was still attached at the sixth floor while the rest was found on a ledge near Mr. Borelli's body, Mr. Antenen added. The other inmates in the room did not alert correction officers to the escape, but an officer discovered Mr. Borelli missing on his usual 15-minute check of the room, Mr. Antenen said. Mr. Borelli had entered the jail system in January on charges of violating parole, robbery and attempted burglary.

The move cut Madstone's locations to 7 cities from 10 across the country. Madstone said those theaters, in places like Denver, San Diego and Baltimore, would remain open. Madstone, based in New York, is an offshoot of Madstone Films, a production company founded in 1999. Its theaters aimed to attract movie buffs with documentaries, foreign films and retrospectives, as well as first-run films. They also offer BYOBaby, a weekly film series that allows parents to bring children under 2 years old at no charge. Officials said attendance at the three theaters did not meet expectations. In all three cities Madstone competed with nearby houses showing similar films, as well as big cineplexes that often pick up the most popular independent movies.

The tent camps, some housing thousands of refugees, have been an embarrassment for Russia, though officials have denied forcibly resettling Chechens. At least 170 families remained at the last camp, called Satsita, until the regional government issued its decree ordering them to leave, saying they would no longer receive aid, according to Tamerlan Akiyev of the human rights organization Memorial. ''There was no violence, no force used to make people go,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''Former refugees are leaving for Chechnya not because they want to,'' he added, ''but because there is no choice.'' According to official numbers that some believe to be understated, tens of thousands of Chechens remain in Ingushetia, living in private homes or makeshift housing.

Born in Berlin, he and his family left Germany in 1933 after his father, Kurt Heinig, a Social Democratic member of the Reichstag, refused to sign Hitler's Enabling Act at the risk of his life. After living in Paris during the 1930s he and his beloved first wife Hilde reached the U.S. in 1941. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army as an intelligence officer. After the war he worked for Roussel Uclaf in pharmaceutical sales and later for ZetaPharm. Hilde died in 1966 and in 1967 he married Jean Owen, who became a psychoanalyst. In 1973 they bought a property in Millbrook, where he spent many happy hours working in the woods. After his retirement at age 80 he enjoyed showing tourists around the city as a volunteer and tutoring non-English speakers.

He was a man of great kindness, gentleness, integrity and devotion. John is survived by his beloved wife Jean, who will miss him beyond measure.

Many royalists believe the heart belonged to Louis XVII, and a DNA test of the heart four years ago confirmed that it came from a close relative of the executed queen. But controversy still swirls over whether Louis XVII died as a child or survived to adulthood. After the ceremony, monarchists shouted ''Long live the king!'' in support of the Duke of Anjou, Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, one of several claimants to the French throne. But Charles Louis Edmond de Bourbon, the great grandson of a man who said he was the adult Louis XVII, insisted the ceremony was a sacrilege. Members of the Orléans family, who also claim rights of succession to the throne, were not invited. Craig S.

If the Beatles opt to have an online presence, other bands might follow suit, said Matt Graves, spokesman for RealNetwork's Rhapsody Service, a music subscription service. ''This has been one of the holy grails of the online music world,'' he said. EMI owns the Beatles' master recordings, and ''any decision on this kind of move would need to be made jointly,'' Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for EMI, said. EMI has been encouraging the remaining Beatles to make their songs available digitally. ''We think it would be absolutely fantastic if the Beatles elected to go for it,'' Ms. Meyer said.

2004-06-11,"36 Hours | Victoria, British Columbia","THOUGH elegant Victoria, at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, is the capital of British Columbia, it is actually closer to the United States than to the Canadian mainland. On a clear day the peaks of the Olympic Mountains in Washington seem tantalizingly close to visitors strolling along Dallas Road, a winding stretch of beachfront that curves around to meet Victoria's picturesque, boat-lined Inner Harbor. When dusk falls, the lights of Port Angeles, Wash., wink across the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Victoria's own spectacularly lighted provincial Parliament buildings and the landmark Fairmont Empress hotel. Victoria invites exploration with a lively and compact downtown, abundant parkland, miles of trails and what has been called the mildest climate in Canada. Taking a spin around the Tudor-style neighborhoods (a tribute to the city's English heritage) of suburban Oak Bay, cyclists can stop for picnic lunch near a towering totem pole (a symbol of the area's indigenous people) in Beacon Hill Park. For now, this gem of a city remains relatively uncrowded, but when the Winter Games come to the nearby mainland city of Vancouver in 2010, the secret will be out.

Breyer, left, with four other federal judges and the chief justice's administrative assistant, Sally M. Rider, as members. When the committee was announced last month, its mission was widely misunderstood to be a review of judicial ethics. Instead, Justice Breyer said, its task is the ''narrow but important'' one of evaluating the effectiveness of the 1980 law that set procedures for handling complaints about judicial misconduct. The committee will begin by examining a sample of complaints against judges during the last several years.

The strike has halted transportation and closed stores and schools, but has not yet affected the amount of oil flowing from the region, energy experts said. Nigerian oil made up 11 percent of crude imports to the United States in the first quarter of 2004, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm.

2004-06-14,The Runners-Up," Pinar Yolacan, a Turkey native and recent graduate of Cooper Union, originally envisioned this portfolio as a performance piece. The idea, she says, was to explore the interactions between several women and the bizarre, flamboyant clothing made of chicken skin that she made for them. ""I created the garments to look Victorian and feminine, with puffy sleeves, ruffles, and layers of fabric,"" she says, ""and therefore pictured them worn by older, queen-like women."" To find the perfect subjects, she placed an ad online and recruited through acting agencies, but found many by simply observing passersby on the streets of New York. (One woman was a former denizen of Andy Warhol's the Factory whom the photographer met in a Starbucks.) Yolacan began photographing her work simply to document it, but quickly realized that the documentation itself was strong enough to stand alone. Starting in September, prints from this portfolio will be exhibited in Yolacan's first solo show, at Silo, a new a gallery on the Lower East Side.

About a third of all sexually active adults in Botswana and South Africa carry H.I.V., a rate nearly 10 times higher than almost anywhere in the world outside Africa.

Two of them, very dry, were at the full; the third, in its second quarter, was melting away in a white cream.''

Tweedy's poems are uncapitalized, generally unpunctuated and adhere to the notion of poetry as a series of surprising images -- for example, ''knives and forks / perform over my bed / fiberglass insulation, / a migrating pink dream.'' Sometimes, as in ''When I Say My Heart'' and ''Prayer #4,'' this approach yields poems that are interesting, if not necessarily cohesive. On the whole, though, Tweedy's awkward and occasionally embarrassing collection proves that you can be in possession of a guitar, three chords and the truth -- and still write a lousy sestina.

Young Charlie idolizes older Charlie, until there are indications that he may be the man who murdered three wealthy widows back east.

2004-06-14,Back In Black,"''The thing I love about Johnny Cash is the sound of his voice, the physical sound of his voice,'' a punk rock singer told Nick Tosches in 1995. ''It's like buyin' a book called, like, y'know, America or something.'' It's not hard to buy a book about Johnny Cash, who died last September at 71. There have been countless biographies, and he wrote at least three books himself: two autobiographies and a novel called ''Man in White.'' This spring two lavishly illustrated large-format books about Cash have been released. The best is CASH (Crown, $29.95), by the editors of Rolling Stone, a mix of new material and terrific stuff from the magazine's archives, including a groovy and gripping chunk of new journalism by Ralph J. Gleason, published in 1969, about a Cash show in San Quentin. (''Let me tell you, baby,'' Gleason writes, ''approaching the huge concrete and steel structure of San Quentin, just approaching it defines the phrase bad vibes.'') The other book, CASH: An American Man (CMT/Pocket Books, $30), by Bill Miller, is basically an overstuffed scrapbook. On display here are things like Cash's Air Force uniform, even cancelled checks. Amid this pile of happy detritus is a photograph of a 1970's-era plastic container with Cash's grinning image on it. When Cash saw it, Miller reports, he rolled his eyes and said: ''You know you've made it when you're on a Slurpee cup.''

Although the fashions changed over time, golf required a sartorial commitment until the mid-80's, with men choosing their clothes as carefully as their clubs.

2004-06-14,New & Noteworthy,"Brick Lane, by Monica Ali. (Scribner, $14.) Set in the cloistered world of Bangladeshi immigrants in London's East End, this acclaimed first novel tells of an 18-year-old woman ''from the village'' who enters into an arranged marriage with a 40-year-old man who yearns to return home as a success. When his prospects sour, she becomes a garment worker and discovers her own desire: she falls in love with the man who delivers the clothes she works on. In her ''deeply rewarding'' tale, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2003, Ali displays a ''technical assurance and an inborn generosity that cannot be learned,'' Michael Gorra wrote in these pages.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/books/new-noteworthy.html

Up north in Hartford, the Connecticut Yankees were lamenting the recent passing of the brightest star in the American literary firmament, Mark Twain. In New York City, W. E. B. Du Bois, anguished about race riots and lynchings around the nation, was preparing the first issue of The Crisis, the magazine of the new National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In Reno, Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, was training for his July 4th title defense against former champ Jim Jeffries, ""The Great White Hope,"" a spectacle that would lead to more race riots. In Washington, D.C., Congress was debating the Mann White Slave Traffic Act, which would ban ""the interstate transportation of women for immoral purposes""-a law specifically targeted at Johnson that would soon send him to jail for traveling with his white girlfriend.

2004-06-14,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Shooting the Great and the Good,"Although he was a costume and set designer, a self-made dandy, an old-fashioned snob and a diarist, Cecil Beaton may have created his most significant legacy in his elegant and studied photographs. The handsome reproductions in BEATON PORTRAITS (Yale University, $50), by Terence Pepper, curator of photographs at the National Portrait Gallery in London, include a superbly androgynous Katharine Hepburn; Marlon Brando before his breakthrough in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' looking, improbably, like a British schoolboy with long tousled hair; Francis Bacon appearing every bit as alarming as a figure in one of his paintings. Here also is an irresistibly seductive -- and remarkably hirsute -- Yul Brynner. In an included essay, Peter Conrad, who teaches English at Oxford University, persuasively argues that although Beaton glorified his subjects, he also ''glimpsed a reality that belied the fiction he was helping to create.'' And he observes that when the social-climbing Beaton was permitted entry into the upper-crust world of Ascot -- the very place he would recreate so effectively with his splendid designs for both the stage and film versions of ''My Fair Lady'' -- ''his presence there was a symptom of the democratization he despised.''

It also commemorates the first day that James Joyce, Bloom's creator, ''walked out'' with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle. On Bloomsday, as it has been known for more than 50 years, Joyce diehards will have a chance to celebrate his great novel ''Ulysses'' in costume, recital and booze.

Mr. Hodges's new movie, ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead'' (opening on Friday), is just his ninth feature in 33 years, and even that total is a little misleading: he disowns ''A Prayer for the Dying'' (1987), which was taken away from him and recut by the studio, and ''Black Rainbow'' (1989) was never released theatrically in the United States. This sparseness of output should place him solidly in the maverick/perfectionist class of Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick, but a Mike Hodges film has never generated the frenzies of anticipation that a new Kubrick once did, or that a long-delayed Malick or Quentin Tarantino movie does now. In an age of hype and instant overexposure, it's almost easier to become a legend than to remain, as Mr. Hodges stubbornly has, a minor cult figure.

Cuomo of New York said yesterday that he had been hired by Lions Gate Films to help appeal a decision by the Motion Picture Association of America to give the new Michael Moore political documentary, ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' an R rating instead of PG-13. The ratings board said it had based its decision on the film's ''violent and disturbing images'' and strong language. The movie, which opens on June 25, gained wide attention after the Walt Disney Company refused to distribute it. A sharp critique of the Bush administration and its decision to go to war in Iraq, it later earned the top prize at the Cannes film festival. Lions Gate, an independent studio, agreed this month to distribute the movie. Mr. Cuomo, who said he supported Senator John Kerry's bid to unseat President Bush, said he had seen the film three times and was ''convinced that it should be viewed and reflected upon by as many Americans as possible.'' He said he did not believe the movie association's decision was politically motivated, but he added that ''there has been a tough political effort to keep this film from being viewed.''

''Morphine, codeine and other controlled substances have been available for years to those who are in pain and for other medical purposes,'' said Mr. Morgenthau. ''Medical marijuana should join the list of carefully monitored drugs that should be made available to those in need.'' Mr. Williams, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, was overcome with emotion as he described the severe pain for which he uses legally prescribed marijuana, saying, ''There are times I can barely put my feet on the floor.'' Mr. Morgenthau said he had been swayed in part by one of his daughters, a medical doctor at a drug treatment program in a hospital in the city, who approves of medical marijuana. Asked by a reporter if he had ever used marijuana himself, Mr. Morgenthau, 84, blushed. After howls of laughter died down, Mr. Morgenthau smiled and said, ''I missed that generation.''

James Joyce, age 22, would walk out that very night in Dublin with Nora Barnacle, whom he later wedded. ''Ulysses'' is set on that day -- Bloomsday, as it has come to be called -- in honor of Joyce's meeting Miss Barnacle. Many Joyceans have made of Bloomsday a literary Mardi Gras, an odyssey through Dublin using the points of Joyce's compass, a day to celebrate Irishness and the peculiar verbal fecundity of that nation. In a novel full of celebrated talkers, it is Bloom, Jew and Irishman, who hovers, voice and thought, over the proceedings. As one barroom patron in the novel says, show Bloom a straw on the floor and ''he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.''",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/opinion/bloomsday-1904.html

2004-06-17,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Report Details Harbor Pollution,"Ferries, tugboats, container ships and other commercial vessels that work in New York Harbor are an unregulated source of air pollution, producing as much smog-forming contamination in a year as 300,000 cars, according to a report released yesterday by Environmental Defense, an advocacy group. The big ocean-going container ships, which run their engines while docked to power lights, lifts and other equipment, produce the greatest amount of harmful emissions. The next largest sources of pollution in the harbor are tugboats and commuter ferries. The report recommends that the government impose strict emissions standards for newly built ships while also offering programs to modernize existing vessels with anti-pollution devices to lower air pollution in the harbor and in neighborhoods near the water's edge.

2004-06-17,"Paid Notice: Deaths   TYSON, MICHAEL M.","TYSON--Michael M., retired Kidder, Peabody and Company Vice-President, active volunteer and athlete, died suddenly Sunday while biking near his Santa Fe, New Mexico home. The cause was a massive heart attack. Michael was born in Bryn Mawr, PA, in May 1933. After spending most of his youth working summers on the family dairy farm in Falls Village, CT, Michael graduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1952. Following school, he served four years in the U.S. Navy, then attended Babson College where he received a BSBA (1959) and an MBA (1963). He began his professional career in 1959 at United Business Service as an investment consultant, and then moved to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. in 1963 as a securities analyst. In 1966, Michael worked as a broker for Smith Barney, and left there as Vice-President in 1980 to open and manage the first Kidder, Peabody and Co. office in Hartford, CT. Michael retired from Kidder in 1993. A lifelong traveler, Michael and his wife, Sarah, moved to France in 1994 to spend a year in Annecy. Upon their return from France, Michael and Sarah moved to Santa Fe, NM, where he immediately immersed himself in a wide range of volunteer activities with various organizations, including the St. Vincent Hospital Board, Kitchen Angels, Habitat for Humanity, AARP tax preparation, numerous Las Campanas boards, and the Kaune School. He is survived by his wife, Sarah Tyson; his sister, Rosemary Beer of Farmington, CT, and his three daughters, Jennifer Mandrack, of Denver, CO, Abigail Ciambrone of New York, NY, and Amanda Tyson of San Juan de Plan, Spain. He is also survived by his two stepchildren, James Condon of Easton, MA, and Jeanine Keay of Baltimore, MD, and his six grandchildren, Evan, Jennifer, Julia, Lino, Maya, and Micaela. Michael's friends and family will always remember him as a strong individual with a tremendous love of life whose hard work, great humor, and generosity were an inspiration and example to us all. Bat da da dat dat, da dat! A celebration of Michael's life will be held at 7:00 P.M., Sunday, June 20th, at the Las Campanas Spa in Santa Fe.

On the ferocious ''40 Bars of Terror,'' from his great new mixtape, ''The Champ Is Here'' (www.djgreenlantern.com), he explains how he updated his arsenal: ''I stepped my game up from a potato to a laser/ So you gon' need surgery even if it graze ya.'' Jadakiss also has a new album, ''Kiss of Death'' (Ruff Ryders/Interscope), which shows off his strengths as well as his greatest weakness: he's a poor songwriter, often interrupting his dazzling verses with dreary three-note choruses. Still, ''Hot Sauce to Go'' has a terrific sloppy-funky Neptunes beat, and on ''Why,'' Jadakiss answers a nagging question: ''You know why they made the new twenties?

2004-06-21,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BUTCHER, CHARLES","BUTCHER -- Charles. Busi nessman and philanthropist known for his generosity and passion for knowledge and justice, died at his home on June 12, 2004 after a long illness. At the time of his death, he lived in Boulder, CO, and maintained a family home in Maine. Charles Butcher was born in 1916 in Cambridge, MA, and attended Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Economics. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and, as a consequence, received what he called his ''postgraduate education'' in federal prison and work camps. He continued to live his values for the rest of his life. In 1951, after several years in the printing business, Charles Butcher joined the Butcher Company, a familyowned floor care products company in Massachusetts. He became CEO shortly thereafter. Over the next five decades, he developed the Butcher Company from a small regional firm into a large, successful, socially responsible company with international reach, 100 times its original size. A pioneer in thinking about socially responsible business practices, he was invited to lecture at business schools and consult with business leaders. When he sold the Butcher Company, then headquartered in Marlborough, MA, to Johnson Wax Professional in 2000, Charles Butcher and his wife, distributed $18 million of the sale proceeds to the company's 325 employees. He published a book, How to Succeed in Business by Giving Away Millions. A lifelong fascination with science led Charles Butcher, in 1965, to found the Lazy Eight, a network of scientists interested in cross - disciplinary ap proaches to technical problem-solving, education and issues of poverty. In 1973 he began working with Dr. Larry Gold in the lab of the Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology Department of the University of Colorado. In 1986, he was chairman of the board of Clonetics, a biotech start-up that gained international recognition for its genetic research; in 1991 he joined the board of NeXagen, a biomedical company. With Dr. Gold, he designed the Discovery Exchange to promote cooperation between academic scientists and business. In addition to his direction of the Butcher Company, his work with high-tech and biotech startups, and his own scientific research, Charles Butcher spent decades as an active and creative philanthropist. He dedicated his giving to encouraging and promoting civil liberties, -big-picturescientific thinking and creative cross-disciplinary research. In 2002, in recognition of his longstanding, continuous support for civil liberties and his leadership as a board member, the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado presented Charles Butcher its 50th Anniversary Champion of Liberty Award. Charles Butcher, with his wife, in 2002, contributed $1.1 million to the University of Colorado to fund the launch of the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology, which is using a multidisciplinary approach to unlock genomics secrets to improve the quality of life and health for all people. An energetic entrepreneur, a master sailor, and a generous friend and mentor, Charles Butcher was the father of eight children. His wife, the former Jane Weinberg, is a founder of the Women of the West Museum, the Co-Chair of the University of Colorado Conference on World Affairs and Co-Chair of Mother Jones magazine. Charles Butcher is survived by his wife, Jane, his children Catherine Butcher and husband Ben Pfohl, Susan Butcher and husband David Monson, Kimiko Butcher and husband Neil Grundy, Benjamin Butcher, Claudine Butcher and husband Michael Hannigan, Gina Lasky and husband David Lasky, and Andrew Butcher and grandchildren Ethan Pfohl, Naomi Pfohl, Tekla Monson, Chisana Monson, Charles Grundy and Rachel Grundy. His son, Charles Evan Butcher, predeceased him.

2004-06-21,The Harlem Project,"Back in 1990, Geoffrey Canada was just your average do-gooder. That year, he became the president of a nonprofit charitable organization based in Harlem called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, and he set out trying to improve the world, one poor child at a time. It was a bad moment to be poor in New York City. Harlem, especially, was suffering under the simultaneous plagues of crack cocaine, cheap guns and rampant homelessness, and Canada's main goal at Rheedlen, in those years, was to keep the children in his programs alive. The organization had an annual budget of $3 million, which it spent on a predictable array of services in Upper Manhattan: after-school programs, truancy prevention, anti-violence training for teenagers. The programs seemed to do a lot of good for the children who were enrolled in them, at least in part because of Canada's own level of devotion. He was obsessed with his job, personally invested in the lives of the children he was helping and devastated when they ended up in prison or on drugs or shot dead on the street.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/the-harlem-project.html

That slightly lagged the national rate of 0.96 percent for the quarter ending March 31. But it still put the annual rate of increase in the state at 10.93 percent, versus a national average of 7.71 percent. New Jersey was eighth among the states in housing-price increases.

2004-06-21,Reconstructing Henry,"What remains fascinating for a novelist about Henry James -- that isn't as fascinating, say, in someone like Whitman -- is that James is not open. Everything about him is ambiguous. Everything he was, he was also the opposite. He loved his family, he longed for them; he longed to be away from them. He loved England, he dreaded England. He loved going out at night, he hated going out at night. He loved women, he loved men. He loved working, he dreaded working. And the matter of his sexuality remains so strange and hidden, open sometimes, back enclosed again. He's constantly glittering, appearing briefly, clearly, and then going back in again in almost every way, including the fact that some of his short stories are so bad, for example, so clunky, so crude. And then the novel written in the same year is so beautifully made and so subtle. So that he's wide open for a novelist to go into the interior and tease out all that dramatically.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/books/reconstructing-henry.html

With the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the army expects more than 1,000 soldiers to graduate in fiscal 2006, a fourfold increase over 2003. But it is the content of the instruction, more than the quantity of it, that is receiving the most attention in light of the scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison ""What we have done is put a spotlight at what took place at Abu Ghraib,"" said Major General James Marks, the outgoing commander of the Army Intelligence Center here.

Fifteen years ago, Metallica drank so much that it was referred to by fans as Alcoholica, and the band members all thought that was hilarious. But now things are different.

2004-06-21,Political Landscapes,"The campaign stump, by its very nature, is a scripted and tightly managed affair. The overall effect -- the strategically selected backdrop, the fixed camera position, the obligatory pressed flesh -- is one of a highly manipulated and well-behaved space. But what if you were to pull back and reframe the campaign stump to include what lies just beyond? Not only would you see the TV trucks and flag-bearing cranes and other paraphernalia of the P.R. machinery; you would also see the uninterested passer-by, the surrounding traffic jam, the beginnings of the unruly everyday life that extends outside the campaign. The British photographer Simon Norfolk, a regular contributor to the magazine and the winner this year of the International Center of Photography's photojournalism award, embarked on this assignment, using a special large-format camera to capture, from a unique perspective and distance, the 2004 presidential race (including public appearances by the president, which are not technically campaign events). The images that he produced reward a different way of viewing the campaign, one that does not expect the photograph to deliver the candidate as the center of attention. Indeed, a viewer might linger over Norfolk's work before being able to locate the candidate. In these pictures, the unessential detail is everything, be it the sharpshooter with his binoculars perched on the rooftop; or someone lazing in the grass; or a Secret Service contingent; or the Washington press corps; or people gathering on the steps of a nearby building; or, outside a fund-raiser in Bal Harbor, Fla., a lone beachgoer fishing in the night surf.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/portfolio-political-landscapes.html

In vain I explain to him that the Cubans left Angola ten years ago and that the rare few that stayed have become dentists on the Marginal. He insists. Almost gets angry. And now this former fighter for the war of independence, this party leader, who has become, with time, this little gentle-looking man, with the cautious and conciliatory manners, with impeccably coiffed white hair, launches into a strange speech in which his glorious past is mixed up with hallucinations of the present: a jumbled confusion of insurrection against the Portuguese; the war, almost immediately afterwards, against the Marxists of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), who are victorious and oust him from power; Sartre on Capri; Fanon, who was a friend of his; and then that dark story of the Cubans, his enemies from long ago, he is sure he sees them returning, on certain nights, like ghosts, to the city.

2004-06-21,How Survivors Survive,"Self-destructive people often come equipped with intoxicating charisma; it's one reason exhausted friends and lovers stick around and clean up their messes. That's the case with Lee, the young, beautiful and angry narrator of Jardine Libaire's first novel, HERE KITTY KITTY (Little, Brown, $22.95). A Tribeca restaurant manager, Lee makes a late-morning Scotch, after snorting coke all night, seem whimsically glamorous. But Lee's charm is fading, and she knows it: ''Innocence was finite and could not be regenerated.'' Even her sugar-daddy French boyfriend, Yves, who ''secretly loved chaos,'' tells Lee to get it together. Inevitably, she bottoms out, but there are no easy epiphanies in this dark, tender book. (And it's not the typical single-girl story of guy trouble and job boredom either.) Libaire instead wisely explores her heroine's long and difficult struggle to take care of herself: to be sober, to sleep peacefully, to be alone. In the process, the author offers glittering descriptions of New York life, both its obstacles and its promise.

A month before, during the siege of Falluja by 4,500 United States marines, this same railway station was attacked by American helicopters after insurgents inside the station fired rocket-propelled grenades at Marine snipers nearby. But now things were very different. On May 1, as Falluja and the world braced for an all-out assault by the marines, the siege was suddenly called off. The marines announced they were pulling out and ceding control of the city to a new, all-Iraqi force. The man who engineered the deal was Muhammad Latif, a 66-year-old former Iraqi Army colonel from Baghdad. Latif promised the Americans that he could pacify Falluja with a corps of laid-off soldiers from Saddam Hussein's army. Some would be former members of the Republican Guard, the elite force responsible for the regime's darkest hours, and some would be drawn from the insurgents the Americans had been fighting -- a very different situation indeed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/the-re-baathification-of-falluja.html

That year, he became the president of a nonprofit charitable organization based in Harlem called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, and he set out trying to improve the world, one poor child at a time. It was a bad moment to be poor in New York City. Harlem, especially, was suffering under the simultaneous plagues of crack cocaine, cheap guns and rampant homelessness, and Canada's main goal at Rheedlen, in those years, was to keep the children in his programs alive. The organization had an annual budget of $3 million, which it spent on a predictable array of services in Upper Manhattan: after-school programs, truancy prevention, anti-violence training for teenagers. The programs seemed to do a lot of good for the children who were enrolled in them, at least in part because of Canada's own level of devotion. He was obsessed with his job, personally invested in the lives of the children he was helping and devastated when they ended up in prison or on drugs or shot dead on the street.

2004-06-21,THEATER: BYPASSING BROADWAY,"The producers of ''We Will Rock You,'' the West End musical built around the songs of the band Queen, have announced that they will bypass Broadway in favor of opening in Las Vegas, which until recently was not exactly known as a legitimate theater town. But that, of course, started to change last week when it was announced that the Tony Award-winning musical ''Avenue Q'' would forgo a national road tour in favor of opening in 2005 in a new $40 million theater in Las Vegas. The opening of ''We Will Rock You'' in Las Vegas may be less of a surprise because this rock musical features the type of large-scale spectacle that the city is famous for. When the show opened in London two years ago, it was roundly panned by critics, who mocked its futuristic plot about a group of rebels, the Bohemians, who are in search of a mythical guitar that was buried by the members of Queen themselves in the late 20th century. The show, whose producers include Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal and the Queen guitarist Brian May, above, and the drummer Roger Taylor, are to announce that it will begin its open-ended run on Aug. 16 at the Théâtre des Arts, Paris Las Vegas.

2004-06-22,'My Life'," Early on the morning of August 19, 1946, I was born under a clear sky after a violent summer storm to a widowed mother in the Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, a town of about six thousand in southwest Arkansas, thirty-three miles east of the Texas border at Texarkana. My mother named me William Jefferson Blythe III after my father, William Jefferson Blythe Jr., one of nine children of a poor farmer in Sherman, Texas, who died when my father was seventeen. According to his sisters, my father always tried to take care of them, and he grew up to be a handsome, hardworking, fun-loving man. He met my mother at Tri- State Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1943, when she was training to be a nurse. Many times when I was growing up, I asked Mother to tell me the story of their meeting, courting, and marriage. He brought a date with some kind of medical emergency into the ward where she was working, and they talked and flirted while the other woman was being treated. On his way out of the hospital, he touched the finger on which she was wearing her boyfriend's ring and asked her if she was married. She stammered ""no""-she was single. The next day he sent the other woman flowers and her heart sank. Then he called Mother for a date, explaining that he always sent flowers when he ended a relationship.

The icon, which is credited with saving the monastery from Swedish invaders in the 17th century, was brought to the United States by an émigré bishop, who said it should be returned once Communism fell and the monastery was restored. It will be displayed briefly in Moscow before returning to Tikhvin monastery 125 miles east of St. Petersburg.

Moody's said that it lowered the senior rating to Caa1 from B3 and the senior unsecured debt rating to Caa3 from Caa2. All the ratings are below investment grade. Debt backed by Delta's aircraft also was downgraded. Delta's ability to reach agreement with its pilots' union on lower pay and work rules more favorable to the company ''in a timely fashion is uncertain,'' Moody's said in the statement.

The Bloomberg administration requested that the private bus companies, which serve Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, be allowed to continue temporarily while city officials renegotiate the terms of the transfer with the M.T.A. The initial agreement called for the M.T.A. to create a regional bus authority, but the State Assembly failed to authorize it. A Bloomberg official said yesterday that the transportation authority now planned to create a division to run just the seven bus lines, a move that would not require legislative approval. But the official added that the new agreement might not include as many protections for bus workers or existing services.

Congress, which spent so many years obsessed with how to look tough on crime, is currently considering legislation that would tackle two of the big factors behind the revolving-door phenomenon: the huge number of mentally ill people in prison, and the difficulty ex-convicts have in carving out new lives in the law-abiding world.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/26/opinion/the-price-of-prisons.html

Test Is More Widely Available,"A rapid saliva test for AIDS can now be used in doctors' offices and H.I.V. counseling centers, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The test, known as the OraQuick H.I.V.-1/2 test, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March, but only for use in certified laboratories. The F.D.A. waiver granted this week means it can be used in an estimated 180,000 sites, said the test's maker, OraSure Technologies of Bethlehem, Pa. The test works with saliva or a drop of blood and, like a home pregnancy test, gives easy-to-read results in 20 minutes. An estimated 225,000 Americans are unaware that they are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and public health authorities believe that many have not been tested because they fear needles. Also, the department said, 8,000 infected people who come to public clinics to be tested each year do not return to get their results a week later. Donald G.

Despite some bursts of growth and the public's enormous support for America's national parks, Washington has chronically failed to pay the bills. The parks' operating budgets have nearly always been too skimpy, and in recent years a substantial backlog of deferred maintenance has built up. Every now and then, a politician offers to do something about it. In 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower began a successful 10-year campaign, called Mission 66, to spend a billion dollars upgrading services and facilities.

2004-06-28,Good At His Job,"''I hate to paint portraits! . . . Youth can better stand the exactions of a personal kind that are inseparable from portraiture,'' John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) confided late in life to the artist Walter Tittle. The irony is that Sargent was the most celebrated portrait painter of his time, commanding the best clientele, prices and reviews. Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent averaged 17 monumental portraits a year, primarily of British aristocrats and arrivistes eager to promote their lineage or wealth; even after officially retiring from portraiture in 1907, he turned out some 20 more as he was continually prevailed upon by friends and prominent people, including Woodrow Wilson and John D. Rockefeller. JOHN SINGER SARGENT: The Later Portraits (Yale, $65), by Richard Ormond, an art historian, and Elaine Kilmurray, research director of the John Singer Sargent catalogue raisonné project, scrupulously plumbs the artist's last 25 years and interestingly does not attempt to cast him as a great modernist innovator but rather as a technically superb commercial artist who understood -- and ultimately tired of -- the demands of pleasing his patrons. If he was criticized by the avant-garde for being formulaic -- Sargent himself praised Whistler for never doing the same thing twice -- the authors exhibit that his best work brilliantly captures his sitters' physicality and temperament. In 1900, the critic Roger Fry wrote of Sargent: ''Such works must have an enduring interest to posterity simply as perfect records of the style and manners of a particular period.'' Hilarie M.

2004-06-28,New & Noteworthy Paperbacks,"AUTO DA FAY, by Fay Weldon. (Grove, $14.) Unlike many of the female characters in her dozens of breezy novels, Weldon comes off as a no-nonsense, pragmatic, resilient heroine in her own life story. Born in England and raised in New Zealand, she was thrust into a troubled, troubling family, whose pursuits included the occult and sexual shenanigans of varying stripes; not only that, but everyone, including her father, mother, uncle and grandfather, churned out novels, stories, memoirs and film scripts. ''Her portrait of London in the 1950's and 60's is intricately evocative,'' Janet Burroway wrote here in 2003. Although she ''ends her book just at the point when her career is about to take hold, her story of a lost girl on her way to finding herself winds up having heft as well as lift.''",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/27/books/new-noteworthy-paperbacks-018104.html

Mr. Bush said the country could learn from Uganda's success using the ''ABC'' approach, which stands for abstain, be faithful and use condoms. He was careful to say abstinence was the only sure-fire method, and that condoms should be used only ''when appropriate.'' Critics of his AIDS policies say that expressions like ''when appropriate'' can be used to limit distribution to, for example, prostitutes only.

At once challenging and accessible -- full of wit, beauty and melodrama as well as novelty and provocation -- these were the kind of movies that seemed to open up a new world of possibility. Unprecedented as they may have appeared to North American viewers, they also seemed to gesture backward, toward a rich and thorny history.

The Bloomberg administration has been reluctant to put stringent limits on the alarms because they are seen as a deterrent to car theft. The number of cars stolen or broken into has indeed come down greatly in the last decade.

Grant plays Porter from his Yale days through his success as a sophisticated composer (''I Get a Kick Out of You,'' ''Let's Do It,'' ''Miss Otis Regrets,'' ''Begin the Beguine,'' ''In the Still of the Night'' and on and on) and ends shortly after the riding accident that paralyzed him.

In ''The Frogs,'' Dionysos, the God of drama, is so unhappy with the state of the theater that he descends into the underworld with his slave Xanthias to bring Euripides, the king of dramatists, back from the dead. In 1974, more than 24 centuries worth of theater complaints later, Burt Shevelove wrote the book to the musical adaptation of ''The Frogs,'' with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. In that version, pictured here -- and in the current adaptation by Mr. Lane, opening on July 22 at Lincoln Center Theater -- Dionysos heads to Hades to find George Bernard Shaw instead.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/27/theater/theater-excerpt-the-frogs.html

He was also absurdly, enviably young-certainly no older than twenty. Martin felt attracted and resentful in roughly equal measures. What was it John always said about yesterday's trade becoming tomorrow's competition? Well, there was little danger of that happening in this case. Martin knew from years of experience that boys this young and this pretty rarely performed sexual favors for anyone who couldn't match them in the beauty stakes-pout for pout, muscle for muscle.

2004-06-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   FARMER, CAROL","FARMER--Carol. World renowned futurist, consumer trend analyst, captivating keynote speaker and strategic advisor to the Fortune 50 on issues of marketing and positioning. Carol died, unexpectedly, of a massive stroke on June 19, 2004, in Delray Beach, Florida, while visiting from her home, Brenguelven, in Landudec, France. Born in Columbus, Ohio on August 14, 1944 to John Edwin Farmer and the late Ruth Cooper Farmer, she is survived by her father and stepmother, Jeannine of Columbus. She graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and spent her early business career with the strategic consulting firms, Management Horizons and The Doody Company in Columbus, and then as Executive Vice President, Marketing, for Lerner Stores and the retail divisions of American Can, both in New York. Her prominence and recognition grew in the mid - eighties when she opened her own firm, Carol Farmer Associates, first in New York City, then in Boca Raton, Florida and, in 1994 in France. Carol was actively involved in numerous management and retail-related organizations and served as a director of two NYSE listed companies ---The Sports Authority and Lowe's Corporation. She was respected for her unique angle of vision, one that translated complex social, economic, political and cultural issues into business solutions. In the early nineties, Carol launched trendtrax as an interactive video newsletter for senior management. Her latest body of work converged in the concept she termed, ''Second Wind,'' insights and analysis of how baby boomers are continuing to re-define the aging process. Carol was a voracious reader, a lifelong learner and an early adopter of the creative use of computer technology. She was loved deeply by a worldwide circle of friends who have come together this past week to express their grief and console one another via e-mail and telephone. Carol will be remembered for her infectious curiosity; her generosity to friends; her beloved Bedlington terriers; and her latest passions ---Brittany and combining her life-long skill in painting with photography, video and digitized imagery. Her remains will be cremated and her ashes scattered over the waters at Pte. du Brezelec in Brittany. Celebrations of the life of Carol Farmer will be held in both Columbus and New York City and will be announced at a later date. Contributions can be made in her memory to the Animal Rescue League, 3200 N. Military Trail, W.

2004-06-28,Mirage in The Desert,"It has been a charged and burdened time -- the D-Day commemorations, the death of a president, the daily carnage in Iraq, the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison, a July 4 just over the horizon -- the sublime and the squalid, the decent and the desperate in American life so overlaid upon one another that it is hard to reconcile the high rhetoric of one moment with the terrible reality of the other. As Americans remembered the boys of Pointe du Hoc and the president who immortalized them, they had to read reports of government lawyers telling their superiors that ''the infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture.'' The discordance between the high sentiments heard at President Reagan's funeral and the lawyers' attempts to justify the unjustifiable left you unable to determine whether the rhetoric of the funeral was a moment of spiritual reaffirmation or just an exercise in organized amnesia. The memoranda from White House counsel, and from Department of Justice and Department of Defense lawyers, gave new meaning to Robert Lowell's phrase ''savage servility.'' Their argument that ''the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign'' rendered the United States' obligations under the Torture Convention ''inapplicable'' to interrogations conducted pursuant to his command left you wondering if they had ever heard of the Nuremberg tribunal. You might have thought that after Justice Robert Jackson's great opening speech at the war crimes trials of Nazi leaders in Nuremberg, no American lawyer would ever dare to use obedience to superior authority as justification for inhuman acts of abuse. In the memos that filled the pages of our newspapers, there was more than servility.

The entire Yeshiva University community and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary express profound sorrow over the passing of a devoted leader of Yeshiva University who also dedicated a lifetime of professional service to the building of the State of Israel. Known far and wide as a passionate and imaginative fundraiser, he served as Vice President for Development of the University for almost 12 years and was the grand architect of substantial and unparalleled growth in its fundraising. A Benefactor and honorary alumnus of YU, he established David H. Zysman Scholarship Funds on behalf of RIETS and all of the affiliated schools of the University and played a major role in the founding of YU's Sy Syms School of Business. The historic Main Building on the University's Wilf Campus was named David H. Zysman Hall in his honor in recognition of his extraordinary commitment to Yeshiva University and the world Jewish community. For 35 years he served as national director and New York director of Israel Bonds, which he helped found, and helped generate more than $10 billion in sales on behalf of Israel. Condolences are extended to his sister Rosita (and Philip) Shamis, and to his nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, and to his longtime friend, Zipora Koppel. May his entire family and many friends be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

He first gained attention as a contestant on Fox-TV's ''American Idol 2.'' ''Josh is a real soldier, not someone playing a soldier in videos,'' Lyric Street's president, Randy Goodman, said in an interview. ''He has a folksy charm and charisma that, to his and our good fortune, was able to be conveyed over TV.'' It is rare, but not unprecedented, for a serviceman on active duty to have a country hit. In 1966 Army Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler's ''Ballad of the Green Berets'' reached No. 2 on the country charts and No. 1 on the pop charts.

2004-06-30,Technology Briefing | Software: Siebel Accused Again Of Selective Disclosure,"Siebel Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of customer-service software, was sued a second time by securities regulators who say two executives violated a rule barring selective disclosure of news to favored investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission says in its suit that Kenneth A. Goldman, Siebel's chief financial officer, and Mark D. Hanson, who heads investor relations, told institutional investors last year that the company was performing better than it had publicly stated. Siebel, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., as well as Mr. Goldman and Mr. Hanson, were named as defendants. It is the second time that Siebel has run afoul of the agency's Regulation Fair Disclosure, which forbids companies to release news selectively. In November 2002, Siebel paid a $250,000 penalty to the S.E.C. for violating the rule at an invitation-only conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs in 2001. The new case was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Siebel said in a statement that no violation of Regulation FD occurred, and that it was ''prepared to pursue resolution of this matter'' through litigation. The S.E.C. said in the complaint that on April 30, 2003, Goldman ''made positive comments about the company's business activity levels and transaction pipeline.'' It added, ''These statements materially contrasted with negative public statements made by the company.'' Siebel shares fell 42 cents, to $10.59.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/30/business/technology-briefing-software-siebel-accused-again-of-selective-disclosure.html

The State Supreme Judicial Court ruled in November that same-sex couples had the right to marry under the State Constitution. The Legislature approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in March. It must pass again next year and could be on the ballot as early as November 2006. The suit, which was dismissed by a federal judge last month, contends that only the governor and Legislature have the ability to change marriage law. The appeals court ruled that the high court's ruling ''does not plausibly'' threaten a republican form of government. The Liberty Counsel, which filed the suit on behalf of the former president of the Massachusetts Catholic League and 11 legislators, said it would appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
