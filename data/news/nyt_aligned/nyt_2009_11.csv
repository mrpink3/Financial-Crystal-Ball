2009-11-02,Quirky Play Leads to Lidge's Unraveling,"PHILADELPHIA - Brad Lidge has been around long enough to enjoy a perfect season and also blow some big save opportunities. But he had never been involved in a play quite like the one that preceded his unraveling in the ninth inning. So unfamiliar with it, Lidge did not even know what his responsibilities were supposed to be. With the score tied and two outs in the ninth, the Phillies were in a shift to the right side of the infield with Mark Teixeira at the plate batting left-handed, and Johnny Damon on first base after a classic nine-pitch at-bat single. Damon stole second base and third baseman Pedro Feliz had to take the throw from the catcher, leaving third base barren of defenders. (Watch the video of the play here.) So, what should Lidge have done? Cover third base? Back up the plate when the catcher covers third? Stand and watch? Run over too late? ""To be honest, that's not something you really go over a lot,"" Lidge said. ""I don't know who's supposed to cover third on that. It's kind of a weird play. No one ends up being there and it kind of ends up being a foot race, and he's faster than I am and he got there before I did."" Damon saw the empty bag beckoning and sprinted to it. Lidge reacted off the mound too late, and now he had a runner on third base with two outs. What followed were three Yankees runs and a 7-4 victory that put them on the verge of their 27th World Series championship. ""He's a heads-up player, and he was able to take an extra base there, which was obviously pretty big,"" Lidge said. Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said catcher Carlos Ruiz should have covered, and shortstop Jimmy Rollins said he was at fault for not reminding Lidge to be wary of the play. Clearly the Phillies were in a defensive formation in which not everyone knew all the contingencies. But Lidge did know one thing. He had gotten two quick outs and looked strong. He still had a chance to get out of the inning after it all happened, and he did not claim to be flustered or distracted by it afterward. Still, the results were disastrous. Lidge hit Teixeira with a fastball that rode inside, and with runners at first and third, Alex Rodriguez drilled a fastball into the left-field corner, scoring Damon to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead. Lidge was asked if he was hesitant to throw sliders to Rodriguez with Damon at third, concerned perhaps that one of them might get away and allow Damon to score on a wild pitch. He said he was not. In fact, breaking balls were impending. ""We would have gone to sliders real soon,"" he said. ""I probably should have done it sooner.""",Blogs,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/blogs/02bats-quirky-p18803.html

Though the council generally has a zero-tolerance policy on graffiti, Councilor Colin Hall told the BBC: “We believe in democracy and wanted local people to decide what should happen to the Banksy.

Though the council generally has a zero-tolerance policy on graffiti, Councilor Colin Hall told the BBC: “We believe in democracy and wanted local people to decide what should happen to the Banksy.

2009-11-03,Almost Famous | Fischerspooner,"“I went to see Madonna’s dress rehearsal at the O2 arena in London. It was so boring because she didn’t make any mistakes,” announced Casey Spooner, one part of the electroclash (remember that?) duo Fischerspooner onstage at MoMA on Sunday evening as part of Performa 2009. “Between the Worlds,” the group’s three-hour performance supporting their newest album, “Entertainment,” celebrated the imperfections and rawness of a dress rehearsal. The audience literally entered through the back stage, getting a close-up of the dancers shimmying into their different D.I.Y. showgirl outfits: leotards accessorized with colorful knee pads, ripped-up gowns and silver running suits that looked liked they were issued from NASA.But it was Spooner who stole the show with his getups — from corsets to Kabuki — and his snarky running commentary. The singer arrived onstage in a bolero jacket and slicked back platinum hair — for a band that seems stuck in the ’80s, this seemed to be a subtle homage to Adam Ant. As he serpentined through his dancers, a veritable hall of mirrors and racks of clothes, he faced the room full of arty hipsters as if he were making his debut to a crowd of 50,000 at the Meadowlands. In fact, the whole performance, snafus and all, was about superstardom. There was the de rigueur talk of the current queen of all things pop, Lady Gaga, and of course the former king of pop, Michael Jackson — at one point Spooner changed into a silver sequined suit and black hat, looking like he stepped out of the “This Is It” documentary.

Nuclear is largely out, capturing and burying carbon dioxide is somewhat in. Gains in energy efficiency are a vital stepping stone, he says, along with vastly expanded deployment of renewable energy sources and improved storage and grid components to make sure the power is available where and when it’s needed.",Science,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/al-gores-climate-choice/

Variety reported that the Halcyon Company, which owns the rights to the “Terminator” movies and related assets, plans to sell the franchise at an auction in January as it goes through bankruptcy. When Halcyon purchased the “Terminator” property for $30 million in 2007, it became the latest in a series of owners that previously included the producer Gale Anne Hurd and the now-defunct production company Carolco. Though the latest entry in the film series, “Terminator: Salvation,” grossed $369 million worldwide on budget of $200 million, Halcyon filed suit in August against a hedge fund that had provided the money to buy the series rights, saying that a backer at the fund engaged in fraudulent dealings, and filed for Chapter 11 in September. The company’s founders, Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek, told a bankruptcy court that the “Terminator” franchise was worth $70 million. In a satirical blog post, Joss Whedon, the creator of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” said he would pay $10,000 for the series, proposing such new ideas as a “Terminator of the Rings” fantasy film and a “Terminator” musical.

Malle first spotted 898 Madison while studying art at New York University 25 years ago. “I’ve always loved the swirling facade,” he says. “It’s reminiscent of Hoffmann’s Viennese pavilion.” Alongside 1930s French art, objets and furniture from Malle’s own collection (including a desk and chairs his grandfather commissioned from the atelier of Jules Leleu) are elements common to all of the perfumer’s shops, including futuristic-looking smelling columns, refrigerated display cases, photographs of his “noses” and bookshelves containing Malle’s archive of 18 fragrances. Also available: his new home collection, comprised of candles, rubber incense (sheets of recyclable rubber infused with scent) and the Fleur Mécanique, a red-cube wonder that diffuses the aroma of fresh flowers into the air.

At first, Amazon appeared to be the low-price player when it extended its $9 price tag to three hardcover books that were officially released Nov. 3. Amazon had originally offered that price in response to price-cutting by Wal-Mart on its Web site for preorders of 10 titles that included the three that were released Tuesday: “Ford County” by John Grisham, “The Lacuna” by Barbara Kingsolver and “Kindred in Death” by J. D. Robb. As of Tuesday morning, Amazon still had those titles priced at $9 while Wal-Mart, which had offered them on preorder at $8.98, and Target, which had offered preorders for $8.99, had raised their prices. At Walmart.com, for example, “Ford County” was selling for $12, while “The Lacuna” was $13.50. At Target.com, “The Lacuna” was on sale for $18.89 and “Kindred in Death” was $17. But by late morning, Amazon had raised its prices  “The Lacuna” and “Kindred in Death,” for example, were offered for $13.50  while Walmart.com had cut them again. All three novels that went on sale Tuesday were on sale at Walmart.com for $8.99, but by the afternoon, Walmart.com had raised its prices to just one penny lower than the price for the three titles on Amazon. In an e-mailed statement, a spokeswoman for Walmart.com said that it would “continue to adjust our pricing accordingly and as needed on these books.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/arts/04arts-MORECATANDMO_BRF.html

The play, directed by Michael Grandage, is the latest in a series of hits that have transferred to Broadway from the Donmar Warehouse in London, which also yielded “Frost/Nixon” and “Mary Stuart.” The success of “Hamlet” might also have something to do with its star, Jude Law, who plays the melancholy Danish prince, and who has admirably held his own in a celebrity-filled season of Broadway neighbors like Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller.

On Wednesday, the National Heritage Memorial Fund in Britain said that it would give about $900,000 toward the purchase of Sassoon’s archives, which includes notebooks he kept on the Western Front during World War I, as well as correspondence, poetry books, photographs and love letters to his wife, Hester. Sassoon, who dealt with the human toll of war in poems like “They” and “Suicide in the Trenches,” volunteered for military service just before Britain’s entrance into World War I, and was a decorated soldier before he refused to return to duty in 1917. (A manuscript of his statement of refusal is among the items contained in the archive.) In June, several authors including Sebastian Faulks and Sassoon’s official biographer, Max Egremont, started a campaign to acquire the poet’s papers following the death of Sassoon’s son George in 2006. With the grant, Cambridge is about $180,000 short of the estate’s asking price of about $2 million for the archive.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/grant-could-assist-acquisition-of-poet-sassoons-papers/

Sassoon, who dealt with the human toll of war in poems like “They” and “Suicide in the Trenches,” volunteered for military service just before Britain entered World War I, and he was a decorated soldier before he refused to return to duty in 1917. In June several authors, including Sebastian Faulks and Sassoon’s official biographer, Max Egremont, started a campaign to acquire Sassoon’s papers after the death of his son, George, in 2006. With the grant, Cambridge is about $180,000 short of the estate’s asking price of nearly $2 million for the archive.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/books/05arts-GRANTCOULDHE_BRF.html

In a news release, press representatives for “Hamlet,” which began previews at the Broadhurst Theater on Sept. 12 and opened on Oct. 6, said that it had earned back its initial Broadway capitalization of $2.5 million as of the week ending Nov. 1. The play, directed by Michael Grandage, is the latest in a series of hits that have moved to Broadway from the Donmar Warehouse in London, which also yielded “Frost/Nixon” and “Mary Stuart.” The success of “Hamlet” might also have something to do with its star, Jude Law, who plays the melancholy Danish prince (above with Geraldine James), and who has held his own in a celebrity-filled season of Broadway neighbors like Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman and Sienna Miller.

For the tech heads, the companies said that the audio files on the 16-gigabyte drives were in FLAC 44.1 Khz 24 bit and MP3 320 Kbps formats, and compatible with PC and Mac. For people holding credit cards, the drives will be sold at the Beatles’ online store for $279.99 and will be released in North America on Dec. 8.

Although Jackson has sold more than 5.6 million albums since his death in June, most of those titles have been too old to count on the Billboard 200, the standard album chart. But “This Is It” is a new title, and it becomes Jackson’s sixth No. 1. The film was the top box-office draw last week, taking in $32.5 million in its first five days in the United States. Also on this week’s album chart, Creed’s comeback, “Full Circle” (Wind-Up), opened at No. 2 with 110,000, and Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” (Big Machine), rereleased in a deluxe package, jumped four spots to No. 3 with 109,000.

Similar motivations — in other words, wishful thinking — have helped drive the growing national obsession with organic food. We want our food to taste good, but also to be safe and healthy. That's natural. Food is more than a meal, it's about history, culture, and a common set of rituals. We put food in the mouths of our children; it is the glue that unites families and communities.

It doesn’t appear to have come from an easterly wave, but rather a persistent area of convection that sat and festered for a week or so. At such a low latitude, it takes quite a while for the Coriolis effect to influence the circulation of a low pressure. Later on Wednesday, an aircraft found that it had sustained winds high enough to warrant upgrading it to Tropical Storm Ida. On Thursday morning, it was again upgraded to Hurricane Ida (3rd hurricane of the season), with sustained winds of 65kts and a central pressure of 987mb.

Yet while the last Yankees club to bring home a championship, the 87-win 2000 team, reinforced the notion that the postseason is a crapshoot, the 2009 edition offers a different lesson: sometimes, just being really, really good is indeed good enough to win it all.

After our glances grew less furtive, he waved me over. I feigned surprise, introduced myself and sat down. His name was Zia, he said, and he had been studying English for three years. He proudly pulled a Turkish-English phrase book from his pocket. His slightly awkward manner seemed situational — but I couldn’t tell whether the situation was that his English was halting, or that he was Muslim and flirting with a man, or that he was Muslim and flirting with a man in front of such a historic mosque.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/magazine/08lives-t.html

In its lawsuit against the game publisher Activision Blizzard, No Doubt said it had agreed on Ms. Stefani and her band mates appearing in the new game Band Hero. But the rock group said that the game makers went too far by allowing Ms. Stefani’s virtual counterpart to perform songs that No Doubt never recorded, including “Honky Tonk Women” by the Rolling Stones. This “results in an unauthorized performance by the Gwen Stefani avatar in a male voice boasting about having sex with prostitutes,” the lawsuit says. In a statement Activision Blizzard said it “believes it is within its legal rights with respect to the use and portrayal of the band members in the game.” Ms. Love, the widow of the Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, raised similar objections when she learned that a Cobain avatar could be used to perform other artists’ songs in the video game Guitar Hero 5.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/arts/music/06arts-NODOUBTSUESM_BRF.html

They said that the producers would update the creative team on the project’s cash-flow problems, and that Ms. Taymor would say that it would be difficult to begin rehearsals before January. Even if the musical’s financial difficulties are solved in time for rehearsals to begin this winter, the show is so technically complex  Spider-man’s acrobatics and possible mid-air flight for instance  that Ms. Taymor and the producers may not be prepared to open the show by April 29, the cutoff date for Tony Award nominations, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly about the production. If the show is not ready to be considered for the Tonys this season, the reasoning goes, the production team and cast would be better off waiting to open later  assuming the producers aren’t faced with a huge financial penalty for delaying use of the Hilton Theater, which they have already ripped up to accommodate Ms. Taymor’s vision for the musical. The show is still scheduled to begin previews on Feb. 25 and open in March, but several people involved in the production said those dates would change.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/theater/06arts-MEETINGTOWEI_BRF.html

2009-11-06,Can Modern Dance Be Preserved?," On July 27, the day after the choreographer Merce Cunningham died, there was an open house at the West Village studio in which his dance company has operated since 1971. A little before 6 p.m., some 40 current and former dancers, in warm-up clothes or street garb, drifted onto the wooden floor. As a pianist picked out strains of Bach, Robert Swinston, a longtime Cunningham dancer who was also the choreographer’s assistant, held an abbreviated class in Cunningham technique. In recent years, with the master crippled by rheumatoid arthritis, Swinston or another veteran often led students and company dancers through the steps. But Cunningham would still come to the studio every day; now the company was heading forth with lonely solemnity, like a riderless horse that misses the familiar hand on the reins.

Instead, the verdict would be that Obama’s economic policies weren’t working, so we needed to do less.

With only two games that are top-25 matchups, this Saturday may seem like a bit of a yawner. But Louisiana State presents a significant challenge for its old coach Nick Saban and his undefeated Alabama team. Will the Crimson Tide be able to get past the Tigers and remain in the middle of the Bowl Championship Series conversation, or will a win by the Tigers brighten the chances of another team, perhaps even an upstart like Cincinnati or Boise State? And then there’s Terrelle Pryor’s first trip to Penn State with Ohio State. Joe Paterno certainly wanted Pryor to join the Nittany Lions, but he chose the Buckeyes and his career has been a little rocky thus far. Would a marquee road victory help turn things around? Perhaps the most unexpected matchup comes from Tobacco Road, where the fierce basketball rivals, Duke and North Carolina, find themselves in the middle of the A.C.C. race. Might there be a last-second finish, reminiscent of so many men’s basketball games between the Blue Devils and the Tar Heels?

All the more reason that Brown, a curator and private art dealer before starting RxArt in 2000, enlisted artists like Will Cotton and Rob Pruitt to create works for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, one of the world’s largest childhood cancer centers, which — miraculously in this day and age — covers the exorbitant costs of treatment for uninsured families. Pruitt made a series of his signature pandas out of shimmering, sequinlike discs; Cotton created two of his Candy Land-style paintings, having invited a 3-year-old girl with a rare brain cancer to help him build the gingerbread house maquettes. These pieces now hang in St. Jude’s bright new cafeteria, where staff and patients all get to enjoy them.

2009-11-09,Reading List the Houses That Gehry Built,"Frank Gehry is out of the house business, having moved on to bigger things. But it was a residential project  his radical revision of his own little Dutch colonial in Santa Monica, Calif.  that put him on the map in the late 1970s and allowed him to explore the ideas that came to define his architecture. This house and others are included in “Frank Gehry: The Houses” (Rizzoli), by Mildred Friedman, who in 1986, as the design curator at the Walker Art Center, mounted the first major museum exhibition of the architect’s work. (I contributed an essay to its catalog.) The book, which has an intimate, down-to-earth tone, features not only abundant visual material but also interviews with Gehry, his clients (including his wife, Berta), and current and former members of his firm. And seeing projects like his own home, the never-built extravaganza that he designed for the insurance magnate Peter Lewis or the guesthouse (right) that he completed in 1987 for Mike and Penny Winton in Wayzata, Minn., makes you hope Gehry still has another house (or two) in him.",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/style/tmagazine/08gehry.html

But what will please the little ones is that unlike that era’s blocks, which mostly encouraged the dutiful construction of towns and landscapes, the strange contours of the 74 PlayShapes will let them build whatever animal, vegetable or psychedelic ’60s pop star they please. “We spent ages looking at old toys and seeing what had been done before, how we could make it new,” says PlayShapes’ Brighton, U.K.-based co-creator Zoe Miller, who with her partner David Goodman also designs vintage-inspired kids’ toys and books for the Tate. “For us it became about open-endedness, the fact that every child should feel that they’re an artist.” $111; go to shhhop.com.

She and her partner Claus Hojer Hansen have come up with an antidote: a 1/16-size reproduction of Arne Jacobsen’s own 1929 house, approved by Jacobsen’s family and scheduled for release early next year. There are Egg and Swan chairs courtesy of Fritz Hansen, tiny Vipp trash cans and a working lamp by the Danish studio Design by Us. New pieces commissioned just for the house so far include a childlike scribble by the artist Poul Pava and prospective inhabitants by the dollmaker Maileg. Stenberg has already noticed a change in her kids since she let them play with the prototypes: “They recognize the furniture now,” she says. “When they see a Jacobsen, they say, ‘Oh, Mommy, those are your chairs, only bigger.’ ” [?][?][?] MONICA KHEMSUROV ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/style/tmagazine/08dolls.html

2009-11-09,Funny Money,"Warren Buffett is now a cartoon character. The Oracle of Omaha has a starring role in “Secret Millionaire’s Club,” a Web series produced by AOL and A Squared Entertainment that goes live in January. This is not a move to stanch his declining fortunes  the man’s still worth $40 billion, after all  but a pro bono effort to teach kids fiscal responsibility. (Adults, Buffett must think, are now beyond his help.) The “club” is made up of a group of young Nebraskans who sell baseball memorabilia online and use the profits to bankroll an investment business; an animated (and slenderized) Buffett serves as their adviser. Searching for a youth-friendly analogue, Andy Heyward, the show’s producer, says, “It’s a little bit like Monopoly.” Heyward first collaborated with Buffett on the animated introductions to Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, in which the frugal tycoon has spoofed Batman and James Bond. “Warren is amazing,” Heyward says. “He does everything in just one take.” [?][?][?] STEPHEN HEYMAN ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/style/tmagazine/08buffett.html

Gray, who owns the less-is-more New York design shop Matter, recalls once waking up at 5:30 a.m. to find the 3-year-old Levi gazing through the window of their Brooklyn apartment. “Look at the sky, Papa,” Levi exclaimed. “It’s beautiful.” The first piece Gray ever built was a three-legged chair. His teacher told him it would never stand up. “But I made it anyway,” he said. “And it worked!” (Gray is seated above in a Victor armchair by Paul Loebach.) His company’s Web address, MatterMatters.com, speaks to the challenge of creating objects in a world that’s already glutted with them. “That’s the daily quandary: Do you create more?” he asks. “But, ultimately, if there’s a want, somebody has to take responsibility for it.

With the help of nine volunteer-driven cells from Austin, Tex., to Johannesburg, Pilloton, who started the company with a laptop and $1,000 while living at home with her parents, aims to create local design solutions and apply them globally. (The playgrounds, for example, were conceived in Uganda and have since been installed in North Carolina and the Dominican Republic.) Pilloton is also the author of the just-released book “Design Revolution: 100 Products That Empower People” (Metropolis Books), which gives well-deserved shout-outs to everything from the Hippo Water Roller (a portable vessel that can carry a week’s worth of water for a family of seven) and Braille-based Lego-style building blocks to D.I.Y. soccer balls (left) and SkySails (which are large enough to help propel cargo ships). “If it’s any consolation,” she insists, “I’ve aged a lot over the last year.” [?][?][?] ALIX BROWNE ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/style/tmagazine/08projecth.html

The peanut-shaped park is inspired by midcentury adventure playgrounds, where children used found objects and postwar debris. It features sand and water, Playground Associates to oversee the action, and more than 350 loose parts, including wheelbarrows, pool noodles and weather- and germ-resistant foam blocks (above, in Brooklyn). David Rockwell, the founder and C.E.O., has created a standard kit that can be deployed cheaply in open spaces across the country, but at Burling Slip he pays homage to its nautical past with pulleys, masts and periscope-like tubes through which children can talk from opposite ends of the park. “Each place encourages a kind of cooperative, self-directed fantasy play,” he says. “Or you can just run around like a maniac.” [?][?][?] JILL SINGER ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/style/tmagazine/08playground.html

I focus on BPA, a chemical variant of estrogen that is often used in plastics and other consumer products. Two billion pounds are manufactured in the US each year — and as a result it is found in 92 percent of us. It’s one of a number of endocrine disruptors that appear to have adverse effects on the body’s hormone system.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/07/is-that-a-plastic-bottle-youre-drinking-from/

His teacher told him it would never stand up. ‘‘But I made it anyway,’’ he said. ‘‘And it worked!’’ (Gray is seated in a Victor armchair by Paul Loebach.)

Mr. Freeman was driving Demaris Meyer to his home near Charleston, Miss., when the car, a 1997 Nissan Maxima owned by Ms. Meyer, swerved off the road and flipped several times.

Mr. Jackson, 80, said that his son helped him with living expenses for years. Mr. Jackson suggested that a stipend should cover his estimated budget of $15,000 a month. Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for the estate’s administrators, John Branca and John McClain, told The Los Angeles Times: “It was quite surprising to learn of the request. Mr. Jackson’s petition will be considered, as are all requests for money from Michael’s estate.” The judge denied Mr. Jackson’s request for an immediate hearing.

Though ticket sales had been holding steady this year, they accounted for only 30 percent of the symphony’s annual budget, and reduced donor contributions have left the company with almost $1 million in debt. In May 2008 the symphony was revived after receiving $1 million from an anonymous donor that covered back pay owed to musicians. And earlier this year $2.1 million was taken from the endowment as an advance. But on Oct. 30 the board of directors voted to file for protection under Chapter 11, and papers will be submitted to court next week. “We made payroll, even in this economy, through October,” said Peter Shaindlin, the board’s chairman. “But cash ran out and dried up.” The symphony hopes to resume operations early next year, said a spokeswoman, Kristin Jackson, though perhaps, because of salary costs, not with all 64 musicians.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/arts/music/09arts-HONOLULUSYMP_BRF.html

And the third reason for drawing attention to the story in the weekend edition of the International Herald Tribune was for the WONDERFULLY odd and serendipitous event that meant that while my season review story mentions the Max Mosley sex scandal of last year and his subsequent battle with a British newspaper – the whole idea there were Nazi role playing connotations etc. – well, on page two of the print version of the same paper in which my story appeared was also a little piece from the same newspaper 75 years ago, in which a certain Oswald Mosley, Max’s father, won a case against another British newspaper in a libel case, in the second item of the story.

2009-11-09,24 Hour Plays: The Writing Hours," The celebratory mood of the first few hours of 24 Hour Plays activity at the American Airlines Theater Sunday night gave way to a more contemplative one shortly after 11:30 p.m. when only the writers, producers and a few others were left. After the actors took off, the writers had a chance to see the stage where their shows are to be presented Monday night. There is already a set on the stage, a big, English country house designed by Allen Moyer for “After Miss Julie,” and the writers will have to work with it or around it. This is not a simple matter, given the absurdly long wooden table, the abundance of what looks like delicate china and a number of other items that are not likely to fit every play that is being cooked up. “It would be tricky to not use this set,” Warren Leight said as the group of writers gapes at the big, crowded stage.

2009-11-09,Street Smart | Auckland’s Art Bandits,"Street art in Auckland, New Zealand, is much more than just random acts of spray paint. Nearly every corner of the city is decorated with sophisticated graphic imagery, from stencil drawings (sharks, angels, aerosol-can characters) to murals (intergalactic space settings, muscle men portraiture) to “throw-ups” (elaborate, bubble-shaped letters forming the artist’s signature). The city council has even allowed electrical boxes to be used as 3-D canvases for street art. While some of the artists and collectives have achieved a certain visibility in the graffiti world — a local crew called TMD (The Most Def) has won the “Write For Gold” international competition in Germany for the past two years — many of the taggers are anonymous. And if you want to see their handiwork, you’d better be quick. Most of the art (excluding the electrical-box mainstays) is either torn down or painted over within a few days.

The Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said that in 2008 it renewed a three-year agreement with the previous producers of that show, which covered its performers through May 2011, and stipulated that it must be honored if new producers came onto the show. The union said that the producers Kim and Sonny Ricciardi of Broadway Entertainment, which recently took over “Tony N’ Tina’s Wedding,” paid the musicians for the show’s Oct. 10 performance and asked them to learn a new song for Oct. 17. On that date, however, the union said the producers locked the musicians out of the performance space and have denied them access to their instruments and other property. A representative for Local 802 said a meeting had been scheduled for Monday afternoon to address the dispute. A message left at Broadway Entertainment was not immediately returned.

In July gun charges against Mr. Williams were dropped after an incident in New York in November 2008 in which the police pulled him over for driving a car without license plates and discovered a gun in the car.

Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians said that in 2008 it renewed a three-year agreement with the previous producers of that show, covering its performers through May 2011 with the requirement that it must be honored if new producers came aboard. The union said that the producers Kim and Sonny Ricciardi of Broadway Entertainment, which recently took over “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding,” paid the musicians for the Oct. 10 performance and asked them to learn a new song for Oct. 17. On that date, however, the producers locked the musicians out of the performance space, the union said, and they have denied them access to their instruments and other property since then.

A pair of butterflies and an adorable school of fish round out the designs, which cost $3,285 or $4,725, depending on size.

The record’s October release stateside brought more praise (including this from The New York Times); and a month-long United States tour, kicking off tomorrow in New York, may be just what the band needs to bring the whispers to a roar.The four-piece band already seems wise beyond its years (each member is barely 20 years old), and for the video for their first single, “Basic Space” (above), they made a clever choice in hiring Anthony Dickenson, an up-and-coming British director and photographer. Dickenson recently picked up a UK Music Video Award for this music video from Speech Debelle and is currently at work on a photo project that will be exhibited next year.

The events I’ve managed to attend have ranged from great to less than, and run the gamut in terms of production values. It was production values to fore on Saturday in Tacita Dean’s sleek, gorgeously majestic “Craneway Event,” a 16mm color film that was unexpectedly hypnotic at St. Marks on the Bowery. Her second collaboration with the choreographer Merce Cunningham is a slow-moving documentary (100 minutes) of a rehearsal in the cavernous, many-windowed craneway of a refurbished factory in northern California. Ms. Dean’s themes center on the ineluctable movement of light — and to some extent the camera — through time and space. A great artist still at work at the end of his career, surrounded by acolytes and ever-deepening shadows, is the perfect subject for her relentless, elegiac art.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/performa-09-tacita-dean-and-merce-cunningham/

2009-11-11,The Author Artist,"The new issue of the Web journal Open Letters Monthly features a “cover” portrait of Marguerite Duras by the Swedish artist Carl Köhler, who died in 2006. It’s a pretty cool image — a sketchy double exposure showing Duras both as an old woman and in the prime of her life, with blocks of color that make it appear as if she’s emerging ghostlike from the gloom — but the main thing that caught my attention was the painter’s name. I’ve been looking at a lot of Carl Köhler’s author portraits lately. Earlier this year, the Brooklyn Central Library mounted an exhibition of them, which I missed, but after the show left Brooklyn for Washington, I heard from its curator (and the artist’s son), Henry Köhler, who forwarded a batch of his father’s work. Köhler was a neo-modernist who especially liked to paint writers and intellectuals: Kafka, Beckett, Joyce, Gide, Beauvoir, all in a rough, haunting style that captured their writerly moods as much as their physical appearances. The exhibition will travel early next year to Toronto and Vancouver, but you can peek at some of Köhler’s paintings in a slide show, here.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/the-author-artist/

The first two years of the project will involve studying the condition of the tomb and examining the spots, whose nature and origin have never been determined.

James Earl Jones played the role of Troy, a former baseball player now working as a garbage collector, in the original 1987 Broadway production of “Fences,” which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play that year. “Fences” was one of Wilson’s biggest commercial hits on Broadway, running for 525 performances. Mr. Washington, 54, above, last appeared on Broadway in 2005 as Brutus in “Julius Caesar,” which was a box-office smash despite mixed reviews. He received an Academy Award for best actor in “Training Day” in 2002, and for best supporting actor for “Glory” in 1990. The dates of the revival have not been confirmed, said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the producers, Carole Shorenstein Hays and Scott Rudin, had not authorized comment.

We think the show still has life in it.” “The 39 Steps” has been playing lately to houses that are only about two-thirds full, but the lower running costs off Broadway could yield lower-priced tickets  and potentially more customers. ...

On Wednesday, the city of Copenhagen said that Mr. Eliasson would create a bridge there, called Cirkelbroen (“circle bridge”), which would provide a winding path across the city’s Christianshavns Kanal. In a news release, Mr. Eliasson said the bridge, whose design was inspired by the sailing ships that pass through the canal, would consist of five circular platforms with their own “masts.” In a statement, he said he hoped the bridge would “reduce speed” and “turn focus.” “Rather than offering the fastest possible passage across the canal,” Mr. Eliasson said, “the bridge will create small variations in the way we see the city and open for a renegotiation of public space.” The bridge is being given as a gift to Copenhagen from the Nordea-foundation, which promotes healthy living and outdoor activities. It is expected to be completed in 2012 and cost about $6.8 million; Copenhagen is contributing about $1.5 million.

The frames come with original blue, green and brown vintage tint lenses to complete the period-perfect look; Garrett will soon complete his optician’s license exams to make sure his customers’ vision is as sharp as their look.

The Campaign section focuses on aspects like advertising, which, Rock explains, is the “mediating factor between the fashion house and the public.” The Place, Scene, Outside and Prada+ sections highlight the company’s architectural “epicenters” in New York and Los Angeles that were designed by Rem Koolhaas/OMA, its iconic building in Tokyo by Herzog & de Meuron and branding strategies that encompass sailing regattas, nightclubs, exhibitions and the art-centric Fondazione Prada.

Judge Mitchell Beckloff named the lawyer John G. Branca and the music executive John McClain executors of the estate, which is expected to take in $200 million this year in revenues from the Jackson concert documentary “This Is It” as well as the accompanying soundtrack album and other business deals. Mr. Branca and Mr. McClain were already serving as administrators of the estate.

2009-11-12,‘Sesame Street’ Responds to Dispute,"An executive for Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces “Sesame Street,” said a segment on the show that upset political conservatives was “equal-opportunity parody” that made fun of both CNN and Fox News. The skit featured Oscar the Grouch, above, as a reporter for the Grouch News Network (abbreviated as GNN). When his work upsets a female viewer and fellow Grouch, she tells Oscar: “From now on I am watching Pox News. Now there’s a trashy news show!” Some conservative bloggers called the comment a veiled shot at Fox News, and Michael Getler, the PBS ombudsman, wrote on his Web site, pbs.org/ombudsman, that “Sesame Street” producers should have avoided the joke. In a letter posted on Mr. Getler’s site, Miranda Barry, an executive vice president at Sesame Workshop, responded that “no political comment or comment about Fox News, subtle or overt, was intended.” Having the “grumpy, grouchy, contrarian Oscar” on “Sesame Street,” Ms. Barry wrote, “shows kids that you can listen to someone with a very different worldview, and even be friends with them, without losing your own perspective.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/arts/television/12arts-SESAMESTREET_BRF.html

This includes music, loud crashes, traffic noises, and voices reading fragments of the work’s inspiration: the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso of Dante’s “Divine Comedy.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/performa-09-joan-jonas-does-dante/

2009-11-12,Nabokov’s Last Puzzle,"In the late fall of 1976, the year before he died, The New York Times Book Review asked Vladimir Nabokov (along with a number of other writers, including John Dean) what he’d been reading lately. He reported that while in a Lausanne hospital that summer, he’d read Dante’s “Inferno,” William H. Howe’s “Butterflies of North America” and “The Original of Laura,” “the not quite finished manuscript of a novel which I had begun writing and reworking before my illness and which was completed in my mind.” In his delirium, he continued, he “kept reading it aloud to a small dream audience in a walled garden. My audience consisted of peacocks, pigeons, my long dead parents, two cypresses, several young nurses crouching around, and a family doctor so old as to be almost invisible. Perhaps because of my stumblings and fits of coughing the story of my poor Laura had less success with my listeners than it will have, I hope, with intelligent reviewers when properly published.” I can take a hint: who’d want to pan Nabokov and end up among the “mediocrities” on his enemies list, to which he might still be adding over on the other side?

A Roth by any other name would still suffer the affliction identified by O. Spielvogel, the fictional psychiatrist an excerpt of whose imagined article, “The Puzzled Penis,” introduced the reading world to “Portnoy’s Complaint.” A condition marked by “extreme sexual longings,” compulsive sexual behaviors and “overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration,” Portnoy’s complaint outgrew its eponymous novel and manifested itself in one Roth protagonist after another.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Harrison-t.html

Later that morning, after American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 had hit the World Trade Center and American Airlines Flight 77 the Pentagon, three F-16 fighter jets were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base to form a combat air patrol over Washington. But degraded radio transmission quality meant that the pilots were left clueless about the nature of their mission. On seeing the Pentagon in flames, the lead fighter pilot later explained, “I reverted to the Russian threat. . . . I’m thinking cruise missile threat from the sea. You know, you look down and see the Pentagon burning, and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . .

2009-11-12,More on the Ethics of Prostheses,"The case most commonly made against allowing some prosthetics into able-bodied competitions holds that I lack an imagination. It’s not hard to imagine, so this argument goes, that we could invent prostheses that would give the runner an advantage. Actually, it is. Unless we are adding energy artificially (robotics, engines, etc.), these prostheses replace what isn’t there. There are ways to test whether they enable competitors to run or to run better than they otherwise might (the unilateral test subjects were chosen precisely because their one natural leg provided a control). When I was a kid, anyone who owned a Guinness Book of World Records will remember the arresting photo of the football player who lacked part of a foot and, with a shoe shaped like a brick, kicked the longest field goal in pro football history. After he won the world record, the league adjusted the rules to say that everybody, including amputees, had to kick with the same-shaped shoes.

Jamison’s outing of her affliction involved considerable professional risk. Some of her colleagues recognized the advantage of her uniquely intimate knowledge of the illness she treated, but others believed it cast a pall over her professional judgment — a prejudice that would probably not have come to bear on a cardiologist, say, who happened to have undergone heart surgery.

And not because, as sometimes with his novels — as with the novels of Georges Perec, one of a handful of other real authors mentioned in the book — you suddenly suspect, at the very end, that you haven’t properly understood a word of what has gone before. You want to reread “Invisible” because it moves quickly, easily, somehow sinuously, and you worry that there were good parts that you read right past, insights that you missed. The prose is contemporary American writing at its best: crisp, elegant, brisk. It has the illusion of effortlessness that comes only with fierce discipline. As often happens when you are in the hands of a master, you read the next sentence almost before you are finished with the previous one. The novel could be read shallowly, because it is such a pleasure to read. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Martin-t.html

His first book, “De Niro’s Game,” won the 2008 Impac Dublin Literary Award, given for the best English-language book published anywhere in the world. “Cockroach” was a finalist for the Governor General’s Award and other Canadian prizes.

Maureen Howard has taken this advice both literally and extravagantly in her tetralogy of fictions based on the seasons: her novel “A Lover’s Almanac” (winter); a collection of three novellas, “Big as Life” (spring); another novel, “The Silver Screen” (summer); and now, finally, “The Rags of Time,” which comes described as a novel, but is more a kind of late, meandering overture, part meditation, part postscript, part appendix.

At first it was because I wanted my daughters to see that all families are fundamentally alike. Now it is because of the profound wisdom Michelle Obama has about her marriage. All couples struggle, and many couples evolve in the roles they play; in the end, though, it’s about making our own contributions to the relationship. Thanks to the Obamas for being honest enough to acknowledge this difficult but universal truth. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15Letters-t-001.html

So what is a concerned son or daughter to do? Getting your parent’s doctor to contact the D.M.V. is not the end of the story. Just as some states have instituted vision requirements for older persons to renew their licenses, a brief standardized screening for physical and cognitive fitness to drive deserves serious attention in our national-policy discussions, along with support for alternative transportation options that enable safe and convenient community mobility.

Spirit and its twin, Opportunity, have been roving the surface of Mars since landing in 2004. Opportunity is still going strong, NASA says, but as Spirit was backing over some rocks in April near a feature known as Home Plate, a wheel broke through a crust on the planet’s surface and started spinning in the soft powder below. Fearful that the rocks could be a hazard to the undercarriage of the rover, the engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory stopped trying to extricate it while they studied the situation with a model in a sandbox. The strategy on Monday will be to try to drive Spirit out of the pit the way it came in, said Ashley Stroupe, a robotics engineer and rover driver.

The agencies will pay $14 million of the $23 million cost for the test-run of the plant. The test will help determine if full-scale operation is viable and cost-efficient. The plant will use drainage water that normally feeds a wetland in Mexico. The government has averted court fights by agreeing to replenish the water for the wetland.

Gerry Fegan, the solitary drinker tossing back shots of whiskey and peering into the shadows for ghosts, is a hard man, an I.R.A. enforcer during the Troubles and still a legend in West Belfast. But unlike former colleagues who cynically retooled their skills for successful careers as politicians and crime bosses, Fegan is haunted by the people he killed — “12 of them if he counted the baby in its mother’s arms.” The ghosts who stare back at him with accusing eyes may be only manifestations of his own guilt, but they won’t let him alone until he takes vengeance by executing the men whose orders led to these deaths.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Crime-t.html

Bookstores are full of titles like Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson’s “Face on Your Plate” and Michael Pollan’s “Omnivore’s Dilemma,” which ponder the ethics of flesh-eating, while books like Scott Gold’s “Shameless Carnivore,” Bill Buford’s “Heat” and Julie Powell’s forthcoming memoir “Cleaving” — in which the author of “Julie & Julia” overcomes a marital crisis by training as a globe-trotting butcher (think “Chop, Flay, Love”) — explore what might be called its erotics.

The birthplace was verified in a letter from his half-sister, according to the cultural affairs office of Copiah County, which is seeking to raise $250,000 to restore the home as a destination for music fans and Johnson acolytes. “He was so good that he would literally turn his back when they were recording him,” said the screenwriter Jimmy White (“Ray”), who is working on a script about Mr. Johnson’s life. “He didn’t want the other musicians to see his fingering technique.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/robert-johnsons-house-to-rise-again/

For the moment, it’s unclear whether the whaling program — which Japan has long cast as important scientific research but many biologists and activists decry — is in danger, according to our Tokyo reporters. There’ll be updates here as needed. [UPDATE, 11/19: This year’s hunt got under way as the fleet headed south.

Johnson, the blues guitarist of “Sweet Home Chicago” and “Love in Vain” who influenced artists from Muddy Waters to Eric Clapton, was born in 1911 in Hazlehurst, Miss., in a home built by his stepfather. The birthplace was verified in a letter from his half-sister, according to the cultural affairs office of Copiah County, which is seeking to raise $250,000 to restore the home as a destination for music fans and Johnson acolytes. “He was so good that he would literally turn his back when they were recording him,” said the screenwriter Jimmy White (“Ray”), who is working on a script about Mr. Johnson’s life. “He didn’t want the other musicians to see his fingering technique.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/arts/music/14arts-ROBERTJOHNSO_BRF.html

(By comparison, the year’s highest-grossing movie, “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” had earned more than $200 million domestically by the end of its first weekend.) On the downside, the industry saw its overall sales decline during October, compared with the same month last year, according to a report from NPD Group. Sales of hardware, software and accessories totaled $1.07 billion for October 2009, down 19 percent from the $1.32 billion in sales in October 2008. NPD predicted that the industry’s revenues for the year would be from $20 billion to $21 billion, most likely down from last year’s tally of $21.3 billion, though coming releases like New Super Mario Bros.

A 2004 court ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to go against the wishes of Albert C. Barnes, who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court said in the ruling that he considered the move “the only viable alternative” to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But opponents  a couple dozen of whom protested on Friday morning outside the groundbreaking ceremony, above, waving signs with messages including: “Crime Scene. Do Not Enter. Destruction of National Historic Landmark in Progress”  contend that the collection’s financial troubles are surmountable and that the move is motivated primarily by the Philadelphia political establishment’s desire to generate more downtown tourism. “This is not about art  it’s about politics,” said Evelyn Yaari, a member of Friends of the Barnes Foundation, which organized the protest.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/arts/design/14arts-BARNESFOUNDA_BRF.html

Though several lithographs of the work exist, the one that was stolen had been hand-colored by Munch himself. It sold at an auction in 2001 for about $35,000, but Agence France-Presse reported the current value at more than 10 times that amount, about $355,000. Munch artwork has been targeted by thieves before: in 2004 two armed masked men burst into the Munch museum in Oslo in daylight and stole “The Scream” and “Madonna” paintings before escaping in a getaway car driven by a third man. Ten years earlier another version of “The Scream” was stolen from Oslo’s national gallery on the opening day of the Lillehammer Winter Olympics.

Mr. Touradji and his firm were accused of using confidential information about Amaranth’s trading strategy and its positions to unjustly profit. Touradji Capital denied Amaranth’s allegations, saying that its conduct in assuming the risk of Amaranth’s base metal portfolio was professional and lawful. “Amaranth has received and evaluated additional information regarding the transaction, including trading records and other information voluntarily provided by Touradji Capital, that is consistent with Touradji Capital’s position that it did not violate the agreement with Amaranth and did not misuse Amaranth’s proprietary information,” Amaranth said in a statement. “Accordingly, Amaranth has withdrawn its summons and notice and elected not to serve a complaint against Touradji Capital.” “Amaranth’s decision to withdraw its claims vindicates our position that we acted appropriately and with the utmost of professionalism,” Mr. Touradji said in a statement. “It also clearly validates our previous statement that the Amaranth suit was based on the misinformation of two disgruntled former employees involved in separate litigation with T.C.M.” The two former employees are Robert Vollero and Gentry Beach. The men sued Touradji Capital last December, contending that they were owed $50 million in unpaid bonuses. The hedge fund filed a countersuit against the men this month alleging that the two men had lied about their abilities, stole company secrets and defamed the firm. Touradji Capital is seeking more than $250 million as compensation for financial and reputational damage",Business Day,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/amaranth-withdraws-lawsuit-against-touradji/

2009-11-18,Leveraging the Obama Brand," Earlier this month, almost a year from the day when Barack Obama rode the wave of history into Grant Park, he had one of those weeks that makes his presidency seem, at times, so confounding. First Obama endured an electoral embarrassment, watching his party lose off-year gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, in part because many of the voters he had so successfully engaged in his presidential campaign, particularly younger voters, stayed home and made popcorn for “Dancing With the Stars” instead. The president had been exposed, the pundits solemnly declared, as having no “coattails,” which are something you really need, they said, if you want congressmen and senators to go along with you on hard votes. Then, just five days later, as Obama’s manifest political weakness was still being dissected on cable TV, the president stood in the Rose Garden and hailed the passage in the House of Representatives of the most comprehensive health care bill in the nation’s history — a bill he had helped pass, narrowly but solidly, by making a rare weekend visit to the Capitol to lobby for it personally. It was, as Obama acknowledged, just a first step, but it was a step no other president had managed to scale, and it seemed to confuse this issue of how powerful a president Obama really is. If Obama has no coattails, then how was he able to pressure nervous lawmakers into making such a perilous vote? And if he had enough influence to get health care reform done, then why were his coattails missing?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/magazine/22FOB-wwln-t.html

They’re the 1960s wingtips with the heavy extended leather sole worn by businessmen in an era typified by philandering, booze and cigarettes in the workplace. They served as heavy anchors to the slender suits of the day that have been resurfacing thanks to “Mad Men” and the spinoffs hitting the floors at Brooks Brothers, J. Crew and Banana Republic. Duckie Brown’s brogue collaboration with Florsheim has reinvigorated its classic Royal Imperial collection with saturated colors and artful perforations; other stateside manufacturers like Alden and Allen Edmonds have classic versions of the shoe that originated in England with brands like Trickers, Church’s and Grenson. I prefer the cordovan color for the rich tone it adds to any gray suit, but black will do just fine. Best of all, brogues are not just suited for business — they are the perfect exclamation point for jeans, whether they are faded and worn, or dark and unwashed.

Mr. Levin also said in his filing that he devised a fund-raising plan for Mr. Cage that included the sale of a dozen classic cars and a $1.6 million comic book collection.

The interview will take place at the Celeste Bartos Forum in the library’s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, and tickets are available online at nypl.org ($15 and $25).

On Thursday, Moss unveils “Remains,” an exhibition by the artist Cathy McClure, whose particular passion is taking these mass-produced, eminently disposable items and redesigning them as precious objects. McClure strips away the plush motorized creatures’ furry coats and fluffy stuffing and then casts the animals’ plastic bodies and limbs in bronze, while leaving most of their mechanisms intact but exposed. A rabbit’s ears, for instance, are reduced to their antenna-like spring supports, while a formerly cocky rooster drags his now-heavy body around, crowing as if he were still king of the barnyard. If the movie “Mad Max” had had a toyshop, these half-whimsical, half-disturbing animals would have fit right in. But they’re strictly for big kids now, with their sumptuous bronze bodies and five-figure price tags. The exhibition continues through Dec. 31 at 150 Greene Street.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/now-showing-stuffed-animals-cuddly-no-more/

The festivities began with an arty party on Thursday night for “mindthegap,” the inaugural show at Prism, a new three-story gallery on Sunset Boulevard. More stars than there are in paparazzi heaven — Carine! Dasha! Peaches! — showed up to support the owners, PC Valmorbida and Jared Najjar, and the featured artists, Barry McGee and Phil Frost. The following night Miuccia Prada held court at her Beverly Hills store for the publication of her new book, simply titled “Prada,” while the philanthropist’s philanthropist Eli Broad hosted an A-list dinner, which was in turn followed by an after-party at Benedikt and Lauren Taschen’s house. Tired yet? The bleary-eyed emerged the next day to make it to the Jeff Koons private reception and brunch at Gagosian before heading back to their hotels to get their glad rags on for MOCA’s 30th anniversary gala. Over 1,000 guests — everyone from John Baldessari to Brangelina and Gore Vidal — turned out for the black-tie-soiree-as-performance-art, which raised over $4 million for the resurgent museum. The highlight of the evening was “Ballet Russes Italian Style (The Shortest Musical You Will Never See Again),” a five-minute act created by the artist Francesco Vezzoli, starring the evening’s M.C., Michael York, dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet and Lady Gaga, who performed her new song, “Speechless,” on a rotating pink grand piano painted with blue butterflies by Damien Hirst. (Larry Gagosian later snapped up the piano at auction to the tune of $450,000.) As if that weren’t enough, what seemed like half of Los Angeles rallied for an after-party hosted by Pop magazine at Prism. By the end of the weekend, there were enough stories to fill a movie and more than one reveler looked in need of rehab.

They are people. We wanted it to be human in scale.” Mr. Stern said the building, which is scheduled to have its groundbreaking next year, was not designed to reflect on Mr. Bush personally. “It’s not a portrait or a defense of his policies,” Mr. Stern told The Morning News. “It is about the presidency, the dignity of the office.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/arts/19arts-DESIGNISREVE_BRF.html

He’s quite worried that the program is looking at cars mainly from an energy-efficiency context, instead of how they will shape and affect China’s fast-expanding cities in a larger sense. “Creating a zero-carbon car for China tomorrow won’t solve the much bigger problems of urban congestion, traffic fatalities and the paving over of once-beautiful cities to make room for more cars,” Dr. Schipper said. “The discussions should back up.

The building, to have been designed by Toyo Ito and estimated to cost from $143 million to $200 million, was to be constructed in downtown Berkeley and replace the museum’s current on-campus home, which was declared seismically unsafe a decade ago. Lawrence Rinder, the museum’s director, told the newspaper that the decision was a consequence of the economic downturn. The museum’s capital campaign, whose goal was $200 million, raised only $81 million by this month. “The gap was just too great, looking forward,” Mr. Rinder said. The museum hopes to announce another plan by early January. “While architectural plans are changing,” Robert Birgeneau, the university’s chancellor, said in a statement, “the goal of building a dynamic, welcoming and seismically safe new museum downtown is not.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/20arts-UNIVERSITYOF_BRF.html

The Volt can run on electricity alone for about 40 miles, according to the company.

2009-11-20,Disturbing the Comfortable,"What can you remember from “The Brothers Karamazov”? Perhaps you recall the rampages of the drunken, leering father; the outraged pride of Katerina Ivanovna; the reeking wake of the saintly Father Zosima; or (the grad student’s choice) the speech of the Grand Inquisitor. The mind’s retention of plotlines, even those from the pillars of the literary canon, is often selective and uncertain. But here’s a different question: What can’t you forget? One paragraph has haunted English readers ever since Constance Garnett translated the novel from the Russian in 1912. Grushenka, a passionate “fallen woman,” tells the tale of a wicked peasant who dies and is dragged by devils into a lake of fire. The peasant’s guardian angel tries to save her by telling God of the single good deed the woman performed in her lifetime: she once pulled an onion from her garden and gave it to a beggar. “Take that onion then,” God replies, “hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold.” If the onion doesn’t break, God continues, “let her come to Paradise.” But as the angel draws the peasant out, other sinners cling to her, seeking their own rescue, and she selfishly kicks them away. The onion breaks, and down she sinks. Dostoyevsky didn’t invent this anecdote; a peasant told it to him. Lessons like this sometimes seem to emerge whole from the Russian soil, but not every writer has the instincts to grab on and hold tight when they surface. Ludmilla Petrushevskaya does.

But the Tennessee-­born Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest is harder to characterize, for even to this day he is a controversial figure. Widely regarded as an intrepid military genius, albeit barely literate and without formal training, whose mantra was to “get there first with the most men,” Forrest was at the same time the millionaire slave-trader considered personally responsible for the criminal atrocities in April 1864 at Fort Pillow, where black soldiers attempting to surrender were summarily shot and others were said to be burned alive in their barracks.

We posted an announcement about it on the community bulletin board, but no one responded. The boat is damaged, and we think it was abandoned on purpose. Rather than incur the expense of disposing of it, my husband took it to the middle of the lake and cast it adrift. Should we be ashamed?

The president recalled that there had been similar panic in the ranks a year earlier, when Sarah Palin’s nomination had delivered a Republican spike and the November election seemed to be slipping out of reach. “Every­body was, you know, obsessed with it,” the president said. “ ‘Obama has lost his mojo’ — and cable TV was, 24 hours a day.

Polk,” which the group first released on an EP in 1990. The man secured the Oregon Territory, slashed tariffs, reformed the national banking system and seized “the whole Southwest from Mexico.” And yet, the song concludes, “precious few have mourned the passing of / Mr. James K.

2009-11-20,Gibson Guitars Plant Is Raided," The chief executive of the Gibson Guitar company will take a leave of absence from an environmental group after a federal raid on the company’s factory in Nashville, The Tennessean reported. On Tuesday, The Tennessean reported, agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service served a search warrant on company officials at a Gibson manufacturing plant where its acoustic and electric guitars are made. The agents did not say what they were searching for or if anything was removed from the plant. But some hardwoods used in making premium guitars, like rosewood from the rain forests of Madagascar and Brazil, have recently been banned under a federal law called the Lacey Act because of environmental concerns. In a statement to The Tennessean, Gibson said that it was “fully cooperating with agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as it pertains to an issue with harvested wood.” The Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group, said the Gibson chief executive, Henry Juszkiewicz, would not rejoin its board until the federal investigation ends.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/gibson-guitars-plant-is-raided/

They would also require certain residential building owners to add parking if they modify their buildings. These changes are “key to fostering inviting, walkable blocks,” the city planning commissioner, Amanda M. Burden, said when she announced the proposed new rules on Monday. Like the PlaNYC and other recent Bloomberg administration initiatives, the rules hold the potential for making the city more pedestrian friendly and create more green spaces. But if approved, they would inhibit homeowners who want to carve out parking spaces on their own properties.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/city-moves-to-restrict-front-yard-driveways/

That was all Paul McCartney, and there could be nothing better.” The song was written by Van Dyke Parks and Mr. Starr, who added that Mr. McCartney’s contribution “makes the song like a conversation between us, and that was Paul’s idea to do his part one beat behind me.” The two surviving Beatles previously recorded together on Mr. Starr’s 1998 album, “Vertical Man,” which also featured contributions from George Harrison and George Martin.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/noted-british-guitarist-drummer-to-collaborate/

Top-ranked Florida is taking on Florida International, No. 2 Alabama plays Chattanooga and no top 25 teams play each other. It seems like a lineup fit for the first or second week. But even in this seeming desert of decent games, there are a few matchups worth watching. Two of them — Oregon at Arizona and California at Stanford — are in the wide-open Pac-10, which has defied expectations throughout the season. Mississippi State at Arkansas may not mean much in the larger context of the SEC, but it does give two programs which seem to be improving under relatively new coaches a chance to show where they stand. Kansas State’s game against Nebraska does matter in the Big 12, though the prize for winning this game will be a date with powerful Texas in the conference title game. And to round things out and keep the A.C.C. fans interested, we’ll be keeping an eye on North Carolina and Boston College.

2009-11-23,‘Enter Laughing’ Is Bound for Broadway,"“Enter Laughing,” the semiautobiographical novel by Carl Reiner about a funny young actor juggling his girlfriends, career dreams and difficult parents, was turned into a play that was a hit on Broadway in the mid-1960s, and then a musical that flopped in 1976 with the title, “So Long, 174th Street.” That musical was renamed with the original Reiner title and revived Off Broadway by the York Theater Company last season, earning strong reviews and warm endorsements from the likes of Jerry Seinfeld. Now the producer Dan Whitten plans to transfer the York show to Broadway during the 2010-11 season, according to an e-mail message he recently sent to investors. A spokesman for Mr. Whitten said that the transfer was about a year off and that no Broadway house had been lined up. The York production was directed by Stuart Ross (“Forever Plaid”) and starred Josh Grisetti, above, who had been on deck to star as Eugene Jerome in a revival of Neil Simon’s “Broadway Bound.” That show was canceled last month because of a weak advance and poor ticket sales for its companion production, “Brighton Beach Memoirs.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/arts/21arts-ENTERLAUGHIN_BRF.html

Set in the mid-1960s as Mr. Ali, formerly Cassius Clay, began cementing his heavyweight champion status, “Fetch Clay, Make Man,” by Will Power, centers on the young boxer’s friendship with Stepin Fetchit, the stage name of the actor Lincoln Perry. The play deals with creating personas, a point of controversy for Mr. Perry, who, as Fetchit, came across as a lazy and foolish black man  an image that proved lucrative for him. Mr. Parke has been cast as Mr. Ali and Mr. Vereen as Fetchit in the production, which is scheduled to begin performances on Jan. 8, and to open on Jan. 15 and run through Feb. 14. The Tony Award-winning director Des McAnuff (“Jersey Boys,” “700 Sundays”) is to direct.

2009-11-23,"Letters: The Archbishop’s Blog, Paying for The Times and Bloomberg’s Blowout","Re “The Archbishop’s Blog” (Nov. 8):The explanation for The Times’s refusal to publish Archbishop Timothy Dolan’s letter is lame and defensive, as is the rest of your column. Your argument seems to be that because The Times gave the archbishop a lot of coverage and said some nice things about him when he first came to New York that it can with impunity publish imbalanced and biased articles about the Catholic Church.Likewise, you seem to argue that because some of the religion writers for The Times sometimes write articles that are not considered offensive, this makes the offensive ones O.K. With respect to Maureen Dowd, it’s difficult to see how The Times sponsors her vitriolic diatribes in general. Her work is short on reason and logic but long on venom and distortion, hardly a contribution to serious public discussion. It’s no secret that The Times is steadily losing readership. Remaining in denial about its skewed coverage of the Catholic Church is just the latest example of how badly out of touch with reality the editors and writers for The Times continue to be. I suspect many will find your attempt to defend The Times’s record on this matter to be thoroughly unpersuasive.MSGR. MICHAEL FITZGERALDPhiladelphia, Nov. 8, 2009 ●I write as a Catholic nun who is a daily reader of The Times, and I agree with your conclusion that The Times does not have a pattern of anti-Catholicism. Maureen Dowd’s column on nuns and the Vatican was compatible with my “anger and anguish about the moral crisis” in the church. If any group in the U.S. Catholic Church should be investigated, it is the bishops who presided over the pattern of moving “troubled” priests from parish to parish without disclosure — to parishioners or legal authorities — of actions that potentially constituted sexual abuse and required investigation. In January 2006, The Times wrote an editorial praising a Detroit auxiliary bishop, Thomas Gumbleton, for his advocacy of improved public policies to deal with sexual abuse by priests and others. Subsequent to the publication of this editorial, local church leaders remarked that the supportive editorial was proof that The Times had an anti-Catholic bias. This reactionary critique causes me to infer that the accusation of anti-Catholic bias on the part of The Times is an example of the Catholic Church’s being defensive and protective of itself, not an objective assessment of the attitude of the newspaper. SISTER SUE SATTLER, I.H.M.Detroit, Nov. 8, 2009 ●The New York Times has no sympathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and, in fact, is institutionally predisposed to find fault with the church wherever and whenever it may be found.The Times does not value churchgoing Roman Catholics as part of its constituency; as a result, we are fair game. The core audience of The Times — secularists, atheists, members of certain politically left-leaning Christian and non-Christian denominations, all enjoy it immensely when The Times uses its pages to kick the church. Archbishop Dolan is correct — other faiths (and, I might add, certain other favored segments of society) — get a “bye” from the writers and editors of The Times. Who knows? Maybe the Times and its Catholic-baiting political and cultural allies will eventually hound us into shutting down our charities, closing our hospitals, ending our school system and walking away from our colleges. But life in New York and this nation would be much poorer for it.THOMAS J. RICE Manhattan, Nov. 10, 2009 ● I see nothing in Archbishop Dolan’s screed that claims the facts of the reporting were wrong. He’s just upset that the wrongs were reported. It is asked: “What is fair to report and criticize about the leadership of a religion?” Everything is fair to be reported — the good, the bad, and the ugly, as long as the reporting is accurate. Dolan says that Dowd dug “deep into the nativist handbook to use every anti-Catholic caricature possible.” Virtually every Catholic in the country opposed the nativist anti-Catholic assault of the 19th century, but today’s Catholics, on the other hand, support and praise the secular press coverage of the crimes and cover-up of the crimes of Catholic clergy — coverage that is almost totally absent in the Catholic press. Nothing is being reported today that the clergy has not brought on itself. For centuries the Catholic clergy has impressed on the laity the image of a clergy so superior that there slowly emerged the perception of a real ontological difference between the two. Accurate reporting in the secular press about sexual abuse, larcenous pastors stealing millions from their parishes, and now a Vatican investigation of our nuns is rightly tearing down this myth. B.M. BYRNEVienna, Va., Nov. 9, 2009 ● It is not surprising to me that the Catholic archbishop would see anti-Catholicism in the article by Maureen Dowd, coverage of the pedophilia scandal and other stories that didn’t reflect well on Catholics or the Catholic Church. The church is and always has been an authoritarian hierarchy. As such, it is able to prohibit dissent or criticism from members of its hierarchy and, to a great degree, members of its congregations. It is reasonable for an archbishop to conclude that if he can’t criticize, no one else should be allowed to either.In a secular, liberal democratic state, the cherished right of freedom of speech includes the right to criticize anybody and everybody. I hope these values persist for a long time to come. I have little hope that religions that depend on blind obedience will embrace them anytime soon.STEPHEN JONESVenice, Fla., Nov. 10, 2009 ● I’m an 84-year-old Catholic who has been reading The Times since I was 17. I cannot agree with Archbishop Dolan’s outrage over Maureen Dowd’s column on the attitude of the church toward nuns. Women are just as intelligent and responsible as men. Many of them occupy the top positions in American business and serve in growing numbers in both houses of Congress as well as presidential cabinets. Indeed, one female recently almost achieved the office of president. What’s next — ordained female priests?TERRY ROEWarminster, Pa., Nov. 9, 2009 ● ● Re “Recession, Revolution and a Leaner Times” (Nov. 1):Doubtless the decision about charging online readers is an important one, but seldom are important business decisions arrived at by following a clear consensus. More often, when one finds a clear business consensus, it is often proved wrong and/or late, like American auto companies’ decision to play down smaller, fuel-efficient cars. No, this is a tough decision that will accurately be made by leadership choosing a path or paths that may appear questionable at the outset, but may be recognized as visionary later.GARY SWAYZEManchester, Mass., Nov. 1, 2009 ●Come on, throw us a bone here — give those of us who care about The New York Times an opportunity to support it. How about a “We Love the NYT” coffee mug, an “All the News That’s Fit to Print” umbrella, an “Honorary Times Cub Reporter” T-shirt, a “Members Only” spot on the Web site — you name it, we’ll probably donate to get it.Like many Times supporters, my home page is The New York Times, and I read it (for free) every day. I send articles (for free) to friends and family by e-mail probably once a week. I get the Sunday Times delivered to my Toronto home but I can’t justify getting the paper (or any newspaper) every day. But I rely on the kind of reporting that no one but The New York Times is doing, and I’d be willing, even thrilled, to support it in the same way I support Minnesota Public Radio, which I listen to (for free) online. Just give me a premium or two and a convenient way to send a hundred bucks or so to keep this kind of journalism alive while it finds a new economic basis for survival.GERSHON SILINSToronto, Nov. 2, 2009 ● I am among those who hate seeing new organizations die by a thousand self-imposed cuts. At 39, I am on the younger end of the cohort that can’t live without newspapers. But my wife and I have already dropped our subscription to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, our local daily, because it has so deconstructed itself that there’s no point in paying for it.After the last price increase by The Times, I reluctantly gave up the print edition for Times Reader. It was a difficult decision and a hard adjustment; I’d still prefer to handle an actual newspaper, but it made no sense to pay over $800 per year when I can pay $15 per month for the same content. It seems to me that there ought to be something in between. I’d obviously be willing to pay far more than $15 per month.I continue to believe that in the long run, the best model for a news organization will be that of a nonprofit, public-service organization. There will always be a readership, an increasingly small and specialized niche for newspapers, but the old business model will not last. In my opinion, The Times should essentially junk its junky free site and develop more along the polished, clean subscription service represented by Times Reader.DAVID TALLMANAtlanta, Nov. 2, 2009 ●Like other dedicated readers, I am worried. There is so much talk of newsroom cuts and elimination of bureaus and newspaper sections, I open the Sunday Times fearful that some section will be missing, or there will be some subtle change in the quality of the articles. Yesterday I was reminded that change and technological innovation will not necessarily lead to the demise of newspapers. I read The Times using the Times Reader for the first time and I was impressed by how easily I could work my way through in an efficient yet leisurely way — as a Sunday read ought to be. While nytimes.com is useful and a site I’ll continue to use, it’s very different from the experience of actually reading the (print-version) paper. I tend to jump about, depending on what grabs my attention, and I rarely get through the day’s news. And I find pop-up ads irritating. But why is there no advertising in the Times Reader version of the paper? Wouldn’t this be a perfect vehicle for print-style ads (NOT pop-ups!!)? The beauty of in-paper advertising is that it is seen, but if it is of no interest the reader can skip over and ignore it. It does not detract from the pleasure of reading the paper. Old-fashioned, perhaps, but effective. Surely there remain some advertisers out there who would see value in placing their messages here.CHERISSE BANDY Foster, R.I., Nov. 2, 2009 ●This morning, like every Sunday morning, I went out to the little coffee shop that charges $1 per cup for any size coffee, and picked up my New York Times. Five dollars for the paper is a lot of money for me at the moment — I am 69 years old, have been unemployed for almost a year, and things are very tight. However, not having the Sunday Times is like giving up a part of my history (I grew up in New York, and along with bagels and lox, The Times is Sunday morning), and giving up on the great tradition of print news. So, I pay my $5, buy cheaper food for the cat (just kidding) and enjoy the luxury of Sunday with the Times.Weekdays I mostly catch you online — and for the past few months I have been wondering why you do not charge at least a nominal fee for this service. I would be happy to pay it (I’ll tell the cat to eat cake) if that fee would guarantee that the print version of The Times would stay with us. Our country needs real journalists — those guys that hold the governments feet to the fire and protect our interests. I hope you do go ahead with charging for online service, and I hope again to see reporters playing bridge and working crossword puzzles.SHARON RESNICKPrinceton, N.J., Nov. 1, 2009 ●Why don’t you ask for voluntary contributions from online readers? I would be very glad to pay $300 per year. It is wonderful to read the paper here in Edmonton at the same time that someone in New York can. And many of your readers understand well how important investigative journalism is in keeping governments honest.BILL KELLY Edmonton, Alberta, Nov. 1, 2009 ●I am a faithful reader of The New York Times online, but if it were not free, I would not have become so faithful. I used to go to many different sites to get all the news. Now I start at your site and believe it is by far the best in the United States. My recommendation is to allow a one-year free subscription to new users. Then try to keep the yearly charge as low as possible to encourage the widest readership. Like the woman in your column, I have my credit card ready. STEVE MARTIN Seattle, Nov. 1, 2009 ●I encourage the debate on charging for The Times online, which The Wall Street Journal and The Economist are doing. But I have a problem if a subscription Web presence will still involve cookies and the related spying on my Web activity. I have debated this with people at The Times and The Economist.The Times suggests that the cookies make the Web “easier to use.” But there is nothing in the cookies I found that improves my Web experience; many of them are tracking cookies that allow someone to build a marketable profile of me.The argument in your column is that millions of online advertising dollars are at stake if charging for access reduces the number of viewers. That may be, but the advertisers should be aware that many Web users, like myself, do not allow cookies and work diligently to avoid any tracking. And a growing number of Web users are learning about tracking and how to block the intrusion into personal privacy.The decision to charge or not is, in my view, a decision on the long-term survival of The Times. I am concerned that in time the loss of print revenue will force the online version to support more and more of the paper’s operations. My larger concern is that the work of powerful newspapers — in keeping our governments and corporations in line with investigative reporting — will disappear without a decent revenue stream to pay the costs of such reporting. So I am willing to pay for access to a robust online New York Times, but I am not willing to surrender my privacy to get it.RAYMOND C. GRAYEaston, Pa., Nov. 1, 2009 ● ●Re “About That Bloomberg Runaway” (Nov. 15):  Your column suggests the correct and inescapable point that polls can serve as self-fulfilling prophecies, discouraging those who would otherwise vote if the polls were more promising for their candidates. The important point left out, however, is that pollsters should ask directly regarding the intensity of support for candidates, rather than relying on whether respondents may “change their minds.” That is a good question, but it is no substitute for also inquiring about how strongly poll respondents support specific candidates. If all polls asked about both the strength of support and the likelihood of voters’ changing their minds, fewer large disparities between poll support and election support would occur.RICHARD E.

He came onto the radar in 1969, playing state-of-the-art jazz-rock with Miles Davis; he was all of 18. From that sideman perch, among the most visible in jazz, he went on to play rugged, horizon-scanning postbop in the style of John Coltrane, notably with Coltrane’s former drummer Elvin Jones. Then came a more traditionalist stretch, followed by relative obscurity after he moved to Europe. Before his run at the Jazz Standard, which ended on Sunday, he hadn’t played a New York club in well over a decade. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/arts/music/23gross.html

That sum of money would then go to Oxfam, while the bookseller could place the books privately. “It cannot be expected that the plan will operate entirely smoothly and efficiently from the start, but it has been entered into in good faith as a way of defusing the ill feeling between the book trade and Oxfam which has been evident in recent months,” said Peter Moore, the Provincial Booksellers chairman.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/books/23arts-OXFAMANDBOOK_BRF.html

2009-11-23,Stellar Design | Astronomy Posters,"Now that water has been found on the moon, it seems even more fitting that 2009 has officially been designated the International Year of Astronomy (who knew?). But let’s be honest: space’s heyday was the summer of ’69, when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong brought a rugged, clean-cut appeal to the final frontier. It was perhaps with this in mind that Simon Page, a self-taught graphic designer, created a series of posters for the Year of Astronomy that are modeled on textbook covers of the ’60s and ’70s. The result is a beautiful exercise in conceptual minimalism, with a clear geometric bent that betrays Page’s math-nerd origins. (He has a degree in applied mathematics and took up graphic design as a hobby two years ago.) It’s hard to choose which to like best, but I’m particularly fond of the deep blue poster, below, in which Page uses diagonal lines to create interstellar objects in relief — and calls to mind the gentle descent of a meteor shower.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/stellar-design-astronomy-posters/

And by “sensible policy ideas,” I don’t mean idiosyncratic notions cooked up by a couple of twentysomething journalists working at non-conservative publications; I mean politically plausible ideas being proposed by economists and think tankers with impeccable right-wing bona fides. If the Republicans were associated with, say, Michael Boskin’s stimulus ideas, Nicole Gelinas’s proposals for handling Wall Street, and some combination of the Miller-Capretta and Troy-Anderson health care plans, they would be a party worth taking seriously on domestic policy. But they aren’t, so they aren’t. And on this front, the wonks can only do so much: In the end, you need politicians capable of picking up policy ideas and running with them.

His desk, an uncluttered Jules Leleu knockoff, was bare but for a phone, a mechanical pencil and a pad scribbled with lunch dates and unreturned calls. Also reclining there: an atypical wooden figure by Alexander Calder, circa 1928, the earliest piece in Fisher’s major collection of contemporary art.

You sense he’s building his brand — the stuff with the handkerchief, getting up in the viewer’s grill, popping his eyes at .55 — but it’s still pretty extreme, and exciting. Look at how he felt music, and moved to it. (Especially .10-.20, that davening kind of thing: James Brown did that too.) Listen to the way he chopped up rhythm, sailing his phrases over the beat. You want to say he’s imitating a trumpet when he sings, but then you want to say vice versa, so neither can be true.

From dictatorship to hyperinflation to, more recently, the currency crisis, which plunged the economy into chaos in 2001, cataclysm seems to come naturally to Argentines.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/required-reading-argentine-soul-food/

2009-11-24,‘Carnage’ Hits a Bump,"Carnage indeed. The new replacement cast of the Broadway hit play “God of Carnage” was off to a slow start at the box office last week, the first performances without the all-star lineup led by James Gandolfini and Marcia Gay Harden, who won the Tony Award for best actress for the production (which itself won best play). This new incarnation of “Carnage” grossed $497,779 last week, compared with $1,107,302 the previous week. The audience attendance last week was only 63 percent of capacity. Still, last week’s gross was among the largest for a play on Broadway (and bigger than grosses for some musicals last week). But by comparison, the play’s former cast had helped catapult “Carnage” into the million-dollar club of top-grossing Broadway shows. The new cast  Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott  has not had the benefit of major new reviews, or anything like the rush of pre-opening media publicity that greeted the original cast. A spokesman for the production, Chris Boneau, said on Monday that the producers had expected the fall-off and noted that the new cast had higher grosses last week than the original “Carnage” cast had in its first full week of previews ($396,470) in March. He added that the producers had a “very healthy advance” in ticket sales and were “more than pleased.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/theater/24arts-CARNAGEHITSA_BRF.html

Mr. Temime, who has represented Mr. Polanski in other matters, told Le Figaro newspaper last week that Mr. Polanski would not return voluntarily to the United States, which he fled in 1978 before sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. But three American lawyers who represent Mr. Polanski  Chad Hummel, Bart Dalton and Douglas Dalton  responded with a statement disavowing any statements by “lawyers in France” who purport to speak for Mr. Polanski. They said that only they and a Swiss lawyer, Lorenz Erni, represent Mr. Polanski in the case against him and in the Swiss extradition proceeding. “Any statements made in the press to the effect that Mr. Polanski will not accept lawful orders of the courts, including relating to extradition, are not true,” the lawyers said in their statement.

Beginning with its 2010-11 season, the orchestra, led by the conductor Leon Botstein, will resume playing its concerts at Carnegie Hall, a press representative for the orchestra said. At its founding in 1962 by the conductor Leopold Stokowski, the orchestra performed its concerts at Carnegie Hall. But in 1992, the orchestra moved to Lincoln Center, where it was invited by Nathan Leventhal, Lincoln Center’s president at the time, to participate in the Great Performers series. In a news release, the orchestra said that all tickets to its 2010-11 season at Carnegie Hall will cost $25. The orchestra will also remain in residence at the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, where Mr. Botstein is president. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/american-symphony-orchestra-will-return-to-carnegie-hall/

Several of the dealer “states” included in the installation are now defunct — including Holly Solomon and John Good — but Zinsser’s geographical juxtapositions remind viewers of their place in the pantheon. “There is something inherently funny about the whole undertaking,” Zinsser says about the exhibit. “The groupings, the borders and implied territories, and a sense of the larger triumph and pathos — those artists who made it, and those who didn’t.” Also in the show: a series of “Auction Lot” drawings that trace the paths of iconic artworks into the market and, for better or worse, highlight the influence of auction houses and collectors on contemporary art history.

Within days of their birth, they became an international phenomenon and were placed in a “human zoo” known as Quintland, where curious people could come and ogle them while their parents and the community grew rich. The psychological damage inflicted by their freak-show existence was chronicled in two memoirs and in several other books and films. Self-esteem issues, depression and the inability to fashion normal lives plagued the girls. Their story should have served as a lesson to the world that multiples ought not to be treated as commodities. Yet, as John Bowe suggests, we continue to exploit them with a modern human zoo — the so-called reality show. Have we learned nothing from history?

Hulu has also been in testing mode on enabling users to choose which ads they watch or to answer a market-research survey rather than view the ads. Some of the most compelling ads have been from packaged-goods companies that appear as single-sponsor units for a program.

But that reality show’s ratings could not lift the debut of ABC’s new comedy “Find My Family” (12.9 million) ahead of its 9:30 competitor, “The Big Bang Theory” on CBS (14.2 million). CBS also won the 10 p.m. hour with “CSI: Miami” (13.2 million), which easily outperformed both “Castle” (10.5 million) on ABC and “The Jay Leno Show” on NBC (4.5 million). CBS was runner-up on the night, garnering strong ratings at 9 for “Two and a Half Men” (13.9 million).

2009-11-25,Curtains Are Drawn at the Gosselin House,"For now, we’ll will see the Gosselin children only in repeats. About 4.3 million viewers watched the final installment of “Jon & Kate Plus 8” on Monday, Nielsen said; it was the end of the TLC series about the Gosselin twins and sextuplets and their parents, Jon and Kate Gosselin. Millions of new viewers flocked to TLC as the parents’ marriage unraveled earlier this year, temporarily creating a reality-TV sensation that some critics said was exploitative of the young children. The dispute between the Gosselins led to dueling lawsuits and a halt in production that all but forced TLC to pull the plug. “It’s sad it’s cut short,” Ms. Gosselin said on the episode that was shown Monday. “It’s been a great run.” TLC had planned to produce a new show, “Kate Plus Eight,” with a limited role for Mr. Gosselin, but the lawsuits have placed that idea on hold. The channel is still developing a separate project with Ms. Gosselin. It has not announced details, but the program is scheduled to have its premiere in the spring.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/arts/television/25arts-CURTAINSARED_BRF.html
2009-11-25,A Hanging Locomotive Needs a Rich Friend,"A train that is supposed to go nowhere seems to be going nowhere, at least for now. Plans by the artist Jeff Koons and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to create an eye-popping piece of public art, a 70-foot replica of a 1943 locomotive engine designed to dangle nose-down from a 161-foot crane  are in limbo because the museum cannot pay for it, Bloomberg reported. The sculpture, estimated at $25 million, shown at right in a model, was expected to be completed in 2011 or 2012 in the museum’s entrance plaza. But the museum said the project had been pushed to 2014-15 because of the damage the economic downturn had done to its finances. Figures recently released show that its investment portfolio lost nearly a quarter of its value during the 2008-9 fiscal year, shrinking to $196 million from $254 million the previous year. Barbara Pflaumer, the museum’s associate vice president for communications and marketing, speaking of Mr. Koons’s engine project, told Bloomberg: “We wouldn’t do it unless someone funds it. Someone has to write us a check.” She added: “This is a very tough economy. Everyone has revised timetables.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/arts/design/25arts-AHANGINGLOCO_BRF.html

The producers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said Mr. Cohl’s communications were in an initial phase and that Mr. McCollum and Mr. Seller did not have full financial details of the show. They have expertise in mounting large-cast shows (including Mr. McCollum’s new revival of “Ragtime”) and entertainment spectacles like “Avenue Q,” which features puppets. “Spider-Man,” which has had work stoppages this fall because of cash-flow problems that preceded Mr. Cohl, has been conceived as an extravaganza, complete with the S-Man himself swinging above the audience.

Crewe, the University of Chicago physicist who in 1970 designed an electron microscope that captured images of individual atoms, attributed a distinction to him erroneously. While he was indeed a pioneer in showing individual atoms, he was not the first physicist to do so. That feat had been accomplished at least once before, in 1955, when the Pennsylvania State University physicist Erwin Wilhelm Müller, with his graduate student Kanwar Bahadur, used a field ion microscope to view images of single atoms. Because of an editing error, the obituary also referred incorrectly to the Chicago Cyclotron, to which Dr. Crewe contributed.

The Swiss Federal Criminal Court granted Mr. Polanski’s appeal against detention in exchange for $4.5 million, along with other guarantees like the surrender of his identity papers to ensure he does not leave the country, the federal tribunal said. The three judges of the court estimated that the bail amount was a substantial portion of Mr. Polanski’s fortune and that given his “advanced age”  he is 76  the “possibility of reaccumulation of fortune in this amount would not be certain.” The court considered the bail and the supporting measures “as being sufficient to avert the risk of flight,” it said. The Justice Ministry has 10 days to submit an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.

2009-11-26,Pompidou Center Workers Extend Strike,"Staff members on strike at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, at left, decided on Tuesday to extend their protest as that modern art museum weighs job cuts, Agence France-Presse reported. On Monday museum employees and security guards walked out amid fears that more than 400 jobs will be cut at the museum’s Beaubourg building over the next 10 years. The French government could reduce the museum’s payroll by not replacing employees who retire; more than 40 percent of the staff members at the Pompidou Center are older than 50, and the legal retirement age in France is 70. On Tuesday representatives of the museum staff met with aides to Frédéric Mitterrand, the French culture minister, but a union official told Agence France-Presse that the meeting “did not go well.” After a meeting Wednesday with Alain Seban, president of the Pompidou Center, Franck Guillaumet, who heads the cultural section of France’s major union, the Confederaton Générale du Travail, said, “The strike must go on.” He added that the job cuts would also affect other big cultural institutions, including the Louvre, Versailles and the National Library.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/arts/design/26arts-POMPIDOUCENT_BRF.html

That made “Going Rogue” the top-selling book of the week on Nielsen BookScan’s chart, putting it ahead of new releases from authors like James Patterson (whose novel “I, Alex Cross” was No. 2) and Stephen King (whose novel “Under the Dome” was No. 3), as well as Dan Brown’s best-selling potboiler “The Lost Symbol.” Ms. Palin’s book also pulled the second-best first-week sales of any memoir by a current or past president, or vice presidential or presidential contender, Nielsen BookScan said. The No. 1 book on that list, “My Life,” by Bill Clinton, sold 606,000 copies in its first week in 2004. HarperCollins, which released “Going Rogue,” said the book’s overall first-week sales totaled 700,000 copies.

2009-11-26,Show Won’t Close to Let ‘Emperor’ In,"Among those in the theater industry who were surprised on Tuesday by the announcement that the Irish Repertory Theater’s production of “The Emperor Jones” would be transferring to the SoHo Playhouse were the producers of “Made in Heaven,” the show that is playing at that Off-Broadway theater. On Wednesday the producers of “Made in Heaven,” a comedy that opened at the SoHo Playhouse on Nov. 2, said that they had no intention of vacating the theater to accommodate “The Emperor Jones,” starring John Douglas Thompson, above, which is supposed to begin previews there on Dec. 15. The “Made in Heaven” producers said that their contract with the playhouse stated that they must give the theater four weeks’ notice before closing the show. In a statement, Barbara Ligeti, the show’s lead producer, said, “I am bemused at the image of the cast of ‘Emperor Jones’ sitting in the laps of the company of ‘Made in Heaven’ on that small stage. The (conjoined) twins will love it.” It was unclear whether the show’s contract with the SoHo Playhouse included an out clause that permitted the theater to close the show if its grosses dipped below a certain dollar amount. Representatives for Darren Lee Cole, the plahouse’s general manager, and Ciarán O’Reilly, the producing director of the Irish Rep, said that both men were traveling and could not be reached for comment.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/arts/26arts-SHOWWONTCLOS_BRF.html

The outspoken Ms. Ditto, a 28-year-old reared in Arkansas, has also carved out a niche as perhaps rock’s only out lesbian who is both an advocate for fat acceptance and a glam fashion darling. Before a recent show in Los Angeles  a city she admitted she didn’t much care for, except for the shopping  she spoke by phone with Melena Ryzik about style, longevity and a list of current bands, with excerpts below.

The pair ran the Hermitage, a combination bookstore, press and gallery specializing in small-press American poetry from the 1950s through the 1970s. But Beacham recently moved back to the city to reopen the Hermitage in a desolate stretch of Bushwick, Brooklyn. “It was too hard to be doing something so esoteric and to be stuck in a small town on the Hudson,” he explained.

Under the bail agreement that was accepted on Wednesday, Mr. Polanski must post $4.5 million, which he has not yet paid; the director must also surrender his identity papers and be fitted with a monitoring bracelet.Not Ready for Prime Time: If an American television presentation can be edited for showing two men kissing, what does it take for a British television broadcast to provoke the scissors of the censors? The BBC reports that BBC4 has dropped its plans to show the ballet “Eternal Damnation to Sancho and Sanchez” by the Venezuelan choreographer Javier de Frutos because it depicted, among other things, a hunchback Pope strangling a pregnant nun with rosary beads. (The ballet also features nude scenes.) “When we announced we were showing it, at the time we weren’t fully aware of the details of the ballet,” a BBC spokesman said.Snowin’ in the Wind: In an interview in a British magazine called The Big Issue, Bob Dylan explained his motivation for recording his first holiday-themed album, “Christmas in the Heart,” Reuters reports. Though Mr. Dylan was raised Jewish in Minnesota, Christmas was one of his favorite holidays — a time, he recalled, of “plenty of snow, jingle bells, Christmas carolers going from house to house, sleighs in the streets, town bells ringing, nativity plays.” Asked what faith he practices now, Mr. Dylan told the magazine, “I am a true believer.”Had Your Fill of Turkey Yet?

Though some comic-book fans say they are coming down with “event fatigue,” that eight-issue mini-series, also written by Mr. Johns, is proving popular. The first issue, which went on sale in July, sold over 175,000 copies.

Ken Auletta, the author of this absorbing, shaggy, name-droppy book, doesn’t seem to like either of them much — he says that Page has a “Kermit the Frog” voice, which isn’t nice, while Brin comes off as a swaggering, efficiency-obsessed overachiever who, at Stanford, aced tests, picked locks, “borrowed” computer equipment from the loading dock and once renumbered all the rooms in the computer science building. “Google’s leaders are not cold businessmen; they are cold engineers,” Auletta writes — but “cold” seems oddly wrong. Auletta’s own chilliness may be traceable in part to Brin’s and Page’s reluctance to be interviewed. “After months of my kicking at the door, they opened it,” he writes in the acknowledgments. “Google’s founders and many of its executives share a zeal to digitize books,” he observes, “but don’t have much interest in reading them.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Baker-t.html

2009-11-27,Please Mr. Postman,"Sometimes you write an elegy without meaning to. In the early 1990s, when Thomas Mallon began his book on people and their letters, you were marveling at your spiffy new dial-up modem, if you so much as knew what one was. His fine meditation on the art of ­letter-writing — he intended it as a companion to “A Book of One’s Own,” his study of people and their diaries — naturally reads differently today: The very physics of our universe, Mallon notes, have fundamentally altered. Time and distance are no longer what they once were. With them have gone, to varying degrees, privacy, eccentricity, suspense, your local stationer and, very nearly, the United States Postal Service.

2009-11-27,Domestic Dysfunction,"Every family is charged with small acts of brutality. One child will flail about with scissors, another must bite or shove, and there’s always the pulling of hair or the tearing of skin. Someone will decide to experiment with matches or lock the door of a dark closet and abandon the sister cowering inside. A grown-up might pretend to be a lion and roar so hard that a child wets himself in panic. Banal but terrifying things happen. Then we forget them. Somehow, though, they don’t forget us. Memories lie buried, yet remain forceful enough to shape our lives. In its infinite dimensions, this is the subject Penelope Lively, the British author of more than two dozen children’s books and numerous adult novels, has explored throughout her long and impressive career. In her haunting new novel, “Family Album,” the act of forgetting is as strange and interesting as the power of remembering. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Browning-t.html
2009-11-27,When Detroit Never Slept,"One of the challenges inherent in writing about Detroit, especially its past, is that the overwhelming nostalgia for everything — the once ­bustling downtown, shopping at Hudson’s, streetcars, corner drugstores, work — can overwhelm the narrative.

To those who know her later in life, she’s as sturdy and dependable as a raincoat, the perfect judge’s wife.

2009-11-27,She Who Must Be Obeyed,"There is a bull market these days in Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) and his wife, Soong Mei-ling (1897-2003), usually called Madame Chiang Kai-shek. When I was studying in Taiwan in the late 1950s, then-President Chiang was regarded by most of the Western students on the island — and many of the Chinese as well — as the remote, cruel man who lost China; his wife was the austere, once-glamorous Dragon Lady who had helped him lose it. Although Chiang alone, or both Chiangs, had appeared numerous times on the cover of Time magazine, those illustrious days seemed over. But now that Jay Taylor has written his comprehensive book “The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China,” we are able to see Chiang as a man of considerable cunning, brutality and patience who skillfully played a weak hand against the Japanese and Mao’s forces while extracting huge sums from the Americans. Similarly, in her latest biography, “The Last Empress,” Hannah Pakula presents Madame Chiang as far more complex, awful and brilliant than we had imagined.

Although visitors may imagine a magical age of sex slaves and tulips, Sultanahmet often feels like a modern Ottoman theme park: Turkish hustlers screaming in precise English, enormous buses disgorging tourists in red fezzes. But Sultanahmet is a center of the city’s religious life and home to many of its most observant citizens. During Ramadan, it is the site of a vast public picnic, where hundreds of Turks break the fast every night. This year I saw conservative ladies sitting cross-legged on the grass with pizza boxes, and ­nonreligious people munching cheap kebabs and humming to live Turkish bands. It felt so much like an American county fair, I half expected to see face-painting booths.

The vibe was decidedly vintage Americana, with temporary “stores” by brands like Gitman Brothers, Jack Spade, Rogues Gallery, Schott, J. Crew, Bill Amberg and Alexander Olch. The wares were cool and the shoppers even cooler: off the charts in hip per square inch. Tucked away in a corner among all the old favorites was a booth whose name I didn’t recognize. I went in for a closer look after spotting some camel toggle coats from Gloverall and heavy knit cardigans from the obscure Danish seafaring knitting company SNS Herning. The stand belonged to a brand new online-only men’s-wear shop called C’H’C’M’, which stands for Clinton Hill Classic Menswear. It was started in March 2009 by Sweetu Patel, a former furniture designer whose selection is skewed heavily toward classic brands like Borsalino, Saint James, Mackintosh and Drakes, as well as other finds like Northern Waters, a Canadian-based knitwear company, and Individualized Shirts.

At issue is a video package that was used to introduce the interview with Mr. Lambert, the “American Idol” finalist who gave a sexually charged performance at the American Music Awards on Sunday. When CBS rebroadcast a clip from that show, it blurred a scene of Mr. Lambert kissing his male keyboardist. But it did not blur a scene of Madonna and Britney Spears kissing at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. In a statement, Jarrett Barrios, the president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said, “I would have hoped CBS would provide the same treatment for images of gay and lesbian people and not create an unfair double standard that treats our community differently.” A representative for CBS told the entertainment program “Extra” that the image of Madonna kissing Ms. Spears “is very familiar and has appeared countless times including many times on morning television.” He added, “The Adam Lambert image is a subject of great current controversy, has not been nearly as widely disseminated, and for all we know, may still lead to legal consequences.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/arts/television/28arts-CBSISCRITICI_BRF.html

The announcement came after a strike that kept the Georges Pompidou Center closed for a fifth day on Friday. Workers at that museum are protesting the government’s plan to cut more than 400 jobs there over the next 10 years.

Now just being able to stage a play is an achievement.” The 1,300-seat theater tried to reopen last year with a comedy, but that effort lasted two months.

Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado, Boulder, said he was told differently as recently as August. (Realclimate.org posted the locations of various data sets.) He credited the university and climate center for moving now to be clearer about the data archives and to provide more access. “When the data is available in its original form those skeptical of climate science can then do the temperature math themselves out in the open where everyone can see their work,” Dr. Pielke wrote on Sunday. “If the global numbers come out as CRU has presented over the years, then it will strike a blow to skepticism about global temperature trend records produced by CRU and restore a good deal of credibility to this area of climate science.”",Science,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/more-on-the-climate-files-and-climate-trends/

Mr. Polanski, the 76-year-old filmmaker who is awaiting possible extradition to the United States, still needs to pay $4.5 million in bail; he’ll also have to pay a $2,000 installation fee and and a $200 monthly maintenance cost for the security monitoring device he will wear. “He will have no prison regime,” a Swiss justice ministry spokesman told The A.P. “He is completely free to determine his daily schedule. It’s also up to him to get in food and other supplies.” Mr. Polanski fled the United States in 1978 before his sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl.Stephen Gately Is Remembered: Agence France-Presse reports on a tribute concert held in London on Sunday night for Stephen Gately, a member of the Irish pop band Boyzone, who died in October.

To answer this question, The Guardian enlisted Kelly Nestruck, the theater critic for The Globe and Mail in Canada, to review Lady Gaga’s new tour, called the Monster Ball, in Toronto. His verdict? “The Monster Ball ain’t ‘Gypsy,’ ” Mr. Nestruck writes. During a performance of her song “Boys, Boys, Boys,” he writes that Lady Gaga “removed tufts of her costume until she was down to a thin landing strip of apparel. Not even ‘La Cage Aux Folles’ and ‘Priscilla: Queen of the Desert’ could beat this wardrobe.”Everyone Wants to Get Into the Act: In The New Yorker, Michael Schulman reports on the resourceful staff members at Orso, a restaurant in Manhattan’s theater district, who have joined together to stage a production of the S.

But I’m a fiction reader, so I was thrilled to learn that Dalkey Archive Press — the Illinois publisher that specializes in (among other things) high-quality translations of challenging fiction — has started a “Best European Fiction” series modeled on the familiar “Best American” books. “Best European Fiction 2010” went on sale last week, featuring 35 stories from 30 countries, and it offers an appealingly diverse look at the Continent’s fiction scene: from prominent authors like Hungary’s George Konrad and Spain’s Julián Ríos to relative newcomers like Croatia’s Neven Usumovic and Ireland’s Julian Gough. The book was edited by the Bosnian Aleksandar Hemon, who now lives in Chicago and says he considers himself both a European writer and an American one. In an e-mail exchange last week, Paper Cuts asked him about “Best European Fiction 2010.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/continental-showcase/

All the Way,"American style — basic American style, the American style that goes back to Henry Ford’s cars, James Dean’s T-shirt and the Timex watch — is not a pose but an adaptation to basic, fundamental challenges. Take jeans, our sartorial signature and our most influential contribution to the modern global wardrobe. They may sell for hundreds of dollars in swank boutiques from Boston to Buenos Aires, but it must be remembered that they originated as work wear for 19th-century laborers who valued them not for their color or silhouette but for their riveted ruggedness. Cowboy hats, truckers’ wallets, nylon windbreakers and Converse high-tops, to mention just a random sampling of the wearable artifacts that have come to define our nation’s aesthetic, were inspired by necessity rather than an intent to catch the eye. Design for design’s sake, our history suggests, is not an American priority. Instead, we design things to do a certain job (whether it’s in a mine, an office or a basketball arena), and when we devise a solution to the challenge, especially one that’s ingenious, simple or cheap, the result is a forward leap in style that may not even seem like one at first.

The “Made in Heaven” producers said last Wednesday that their contract with the Soho Playhouse gave them the discretion to close down their show after giving four weeks’ notice. But on Monday, they said they would close the show after its Dec. 7 performance. In a statement, Barbara Ligeti, the lead producer of “Made in Heaven,” said, “We agonized over this decision,” adding: “The Soho Playhouse made us a very favorable offer, and we felt that sparring with them, to the detriment of the Irish Rep’s wonderful production, would be counterproductive and mean-spirited.” ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/comedy-will-close-to-make-way-for-emperor-jones/

But on Monday they said they would close after the Dec. 7 performance.

Mr. Lambert, the “American Idol” finalist, set off a torrent of criticism with his Nov. 22 appearance at the American Music Awards, which were broadcast on ABC, in which he simulated sex acts, kissed his male band mate, above, and extended his middle finger to a television camera.
