Now, Stephen Baxter has written a sequel, “The Massacre of Mankind,” authorized by Wells’s estate. (Baxter is the author of dozens of science-fiction books, and, even more pertinently, a vice president of the H.G. Wells Society.) His book was published in Britain earlier this year, where The Guardian said: “It’s Baxter’s best novel in a long time, and this may be because it reads like a genuine labor of love.” Below, Baxter talks about the evolution of Wells’s original story, his own childhood love of science fiction and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/books/massacre-of-mankind-sequel-to-war-of-worlds-stephen-baxter.html

It took longer than expected — what doesn’t in the restaurant world? Finally, it’s ready, and just in time for the fall season. The underground space was discovered during the construction of the pastry shop upstairs, and it turns out that it was once a speakeasy, a bit of history that seems to be turning up often these days. It was also a gambling school, and Chanson’s cocktail menu nods to that with drinks like Poker Alice, named for a gambler and mixed with assorted liqueurs. There’s a 16-seat dessert bar, as well as booths and tables, and playing-card motifs on the walls. The six-course dessert tasting, which includes some more savory items, like olive oil gelato with sea salt and eucalyptus to clear the palate, is $68, by reservation for people of drinking age.

But it’s also worth noting that Jeff Sessions just tried to sell it with junk economics, claiming that the Dreamers are taking American jobs.

Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in “It,” (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, he’s also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels.

One hand clutches an iPhone-5, earbud wires are wrapped around his neck, a pack of American Spirits are balanced on his knee, his sunglasses are hung in the crook of a white tee. He has a dad bod and his stubble is grayish. Phoenix is an activist, primarily concerned with animal rights (he’s been a vegan since he was 3) and has supported, among others, PETA, Red Cross and Amnesty International — but how would anyone know this, since he has no social-media presence (no Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter) to connect with followers and inspire them?

2017-09-06,Inside the Sparkling World of Siddharth Kasliwal,"As a boy, Siddharth Kasliwal accompanied his father, Munnu — an heir to the Gem Palace, Jaipur’s legendary jewelry emporium — to mines in Brazil and on business trips to Paris. ‘‘He would give me ruby and sapphire beads to occupy me,’’ the younger Kasliwal says, ‘‘as though they were toys.’’ In the jewelry trade for nine generations, the Kasliwals and their storied 109-year-old store and workshop have created spectacular pieces for royals (Princess Diana), maharanis (the Ava Gardner-like Gayatri Devi of Jaipur) and rock stars (Mick Jagger). In the wake of Munnu’s 2012 death at age 54 from brain cancer, his 33-year-old son, who friends call Sid, has emerged in his own right as a designer — and bon vivant. Munnu brought Indian fine jewelry the international recognition once reserved for European houses and championed previously unsung stones like the spinel; his son, who opened a vivid new Mumbai boutique in 2015, aims to further marry historical influences with contemporary settings in his work. Good-naturedly dodging his mother’s entreaties to settle down, the peripatetic and engaging Kasliwal scours the world for outrageous gems (a recent find was an old 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show) and the best parties. When not on the road or in India, he can be found in his Upper East Side Manhattan atelier, entertaining clients in the scarlet-upholstered suite of a townhouse, surrounded by velvet-lined trays of glittering adornments. ‘‘I was raised for this,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s the best life you can imagine.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/t-magazine/fashion/sid-kasliwal-gem-palace-profile-in-style.html

Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected “Dreamers” from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: ‘Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,’ ” Curbelo told “All Things Considered,” “ ‘as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.’ ” Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief. Rather it is the Catch-22 that they have been dreading ever since Trump was elected.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/magazine/the-daca-fix-that-immigration-activists-fear.html

But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters.

2017-09-07,Review: The Crime Drama ‘True to the Game’ Lacks Finesse," “True to the Game” presents a Philadelphia parable. Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of “True to the Game” are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods’s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. It’s all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/movies/true-to-the-game-review.html

2017-09-07,‘The Way to Survive It Was to Make A’s’,"The road to Virginia Episcopal School was more secluded in those days, winding a few miles from the white section of segregated Lynchburg through a wood of maple and oak to the school’s rolling campus, shielded by trees and the more distant Blue Ridge Mountains. The usual stream of cars navigated the bends on the first day of school, white families ferrying their adolescent sons. Like nearly every other elite prep school in the South, it had been the boarding school’s tradition since its founding in 1916 that its teachers guide white boys toward its ideal of manhood — erudite, religious, resilient. But that afternoon of Sept. 8, 1967, a taxi pulled up the long driveway carrying a black teenager, Marvin Barnard. He had journeyed across the state, 120 miles by bus, from the black side of Richmond, unaccompanied, toting a single suitcase. In all of Virginia, a state whose lawmakers had responded to the 1954 court-ordered desegregation of public schools with a strategy of declared “massive resistance,” no black child had ever enrolled in a private boarding school. When Marvin stepped foot on V.E.S. ground, wearing a lightweight sport jacket, a white dress shirt, a modest necktie and a cap like the ones the Beatles were wearing, the white idyll was over.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/magazine/the-way-to-survive-it-was-to-make-as.html

2017-09-07,Bruce Chatwin: One of the Last Great Explorers,"In 1972, Bruce Chatwin left England and began to travel. This was not so long ago, and yet the world back then was still so unmapped: A traveler could and did wander through it like Pausanias, like Ibn Battuta, like the explorers who wrote the first drafts of the romance of movement, of the twinned danger and delight of finding oneself in a place where one was at the mercy of unfriendly but intriguing strangers. A traveler, back then, was far less likely to find in the foreign traces of the familiar. Depending on where he ventured, he had significantly fewer guarantees of safety, and equally thrillingly, only limited ways of communicating with those he knew and had left behind. And it wasn’t only that you could (and, indeed, would) travel as Ibn Battuta had, but, crucially, you could travel where Ibn Battuta had, as well: Sanaa and Baghdad and Damascus, all of which are now treacherous or off-­limits, cities in countries forced by war or disaster or bad governance to deny their cultures’ extravagant senses of hospitality.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/t-magazine/bruce-chatwin.html

Hayden, who developed a love for artist-made books while a graduate student at the Maryland Institute College of Art and most recently worked with Hauser & Wirth’s Book & Printed Matter Lab, found the pocket-size space while searching for an apartment on Craigslist. The idea for a bookshop came together almost immediately. She tapped designers Jonathan Olivares, Paul Matevosyan and Raffy Mardirossian to create simple, bold shelving — painted mustard yellow in a nod to the Ed Ruscha painting from which the shop takes its name — and began sourcing books. Oof specializes in artist-made and locally published books and zines, as well as older catalogs and monographs. Some of Hayden’s favorite recent finds include Jenny Holzer’s “Truisms” and a Fernand Léger that she says, “I’m definitely going to grieve a bit to sell.” The shop also features art objects by ceramist Grant Levy-Lucero and hosts regular work and talks from emerging L.A. artists.  — MERRELL HAMBLETON ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/t-magazine/zaria-forman-eris-parfums-editors-picks.html

2017-09-12,What Could We Lose if a NASA Climate Mission Goes Dark?,"In late August, as Hurricane Harvey began smashing into the Texas coast, a flood of data began pouring in along with the catastrophic quantities of rainwater. It wasn’t from the nonstop news coverage on CNN and elsewhere; it was from the transmissions that lay behind it, in the pulses of information coming down from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, crucial tools for monitoring big storms in the Gulf of Mexico, were capturing cloud formations, surface temperatures and barometric pressures, which were then fed into computer models tracking the storm’s strength and intensity. At the same time, NASA was using a group of satellites to keep tabs on soil moisture, flood patterns and power failures all over East Texas. In various ways, this torrent of data was being collected continuously from hundreds (or even thousands) of miles overhead, through radar instruments and spectroradiometer sensors and exquisitely calibrated imaging cameras. The machines being used aren’t household names — they go by acronyms like GOES-13, Modis and SMAP — but they demonstrate why the popular view of Earth as a big blue planet with only the Moon as its companion could do with some revising. We are also surrounded by a constellation of satellites spinning elliptical webs of environmental observation, day and night.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/magazine/what-could-we-lose-if-a-nasa-mission-goes-dark.html

But now, in the morning hours after Donald J. Trump’s White House upset, Hillary Clinton donned gray and purple for her concession to the country.

This was, it turned out, because the place was not technically an apartment; it had been, most recently, the offices of a law firm. But it was not technically office space, either — it was the bottom three floors of one of the opulent Beaux-Arts style mansions built by wealthy Bruxellois during the late 1800s, in the quiet, forested area south of the city center. Belgium’s architectural conservation laws had been notoriously lax, and so over the decades many of those buildings were demolished or carved up into offices or apartments. But the interiors of this one had somehow survived mostly intact, with ornate stucco moldings, marble fireplaces, wooden paneling, wrought-iron stair rails and parquet floors made in the traditional way, without a single nail. Huge windows on the grand top floor looked out across Avenue Winston Churchill on one side and into a densely wooded garden on the other.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/t-magazine/design/belgian-architect-david-van-severen-home.html

In December 2013, a mob of anti-Kremlin protesters knocked over a hulking red quartzite Lenin on one of Kiev’s main squares, setting off a wave of removals that came to be known as “Leninfall.” At its peak, in February 2014, 376 Lenins were felled in a single month.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/magazine/how-to-pull-down-a-statue.html

2017-09-15,Alice Waters’s Grilled Cheese Is Not Like Yours and Mine,"LUNCH MENU: The chef and restaurateur Alice Waters’s new memoir, “Coming to My Senses,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13, and for all of its frank talk about free love and hard drinking, its most scandalous revelation may be that when Waters was in grade school in suburban New Jersey, she used to trade her peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches for bologna and cheese on white bread. Alice Waters? The owner of Chez Panisse and generalissimo of the organic food revolution? Back then, she happily admits, her favorite lunch was grilled cheese with pickles and maybe an orange soda, if she could sneak out to a local dinette. “I think of grilled cheese sandwiches as one of the great comfort foods,” she writes, before snapping out of it to become the Waters we all recognize: “These days I make them with a Cantal, a mountain cheese from France that’s a little like a Swiss — I like my cheese to be a bit tangy. I usually choose some good whole wheat or levain bread from Acme Bread Company. I slice the cheese and put it inside the bread, put some olive oil in a cast iron pan — not too much! — drizzle oil on the top of the sandwich, and then weight it down with another cast iron pan. When it gets really brown, I turn it over, and when the cheese starts to bubble out the sides, I take it out. Then I rub both sides with half a clove of garlic and serve it with a dill pickle or some sauerkraut (good homemade sauerkraut, not the kraut out of the can that I never liked as a child!). Or I’ll have a little undressed salad on the side — the melted cheese and the olive oil from the sandwich almost dress the lettuce. Sometimes in the summer I’ll put some hot peppers in.” All right, that does sound pretty good. But it’s probably for the best that Chez Panisse never established a children’s menu. I’d hate to see what Waters does to chicken fingers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/books/review/alice-waters-best-seller-list-memoir-coming-to-my-senses.html

As the season continues, there will be three premieres by company members, the principal Lauren Lovette and the soloists Troy Schumacher and Justin Peck, City Ballet’s resident choreographer. There’s one wild card in the mix: Gianna Reisen, a 2017 graduate of the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, will create her first work for the company. Ms. Reisen, 18, and now an apprentice at Ballet Semperoper Dresden, is the youngest choreographer the company has ever featured.

Every time it’s invasive.” The source of this particular affliction is “Joanne,” the 2016 album of soft-rock ballads that plunged her into a tailspin as she wondered if fans would accept her transformation from disco-pop provocateur into grief-driven chanteuse. The director, Chris Moukarbel, frames the story with scenes from Gaga’s February Super Bowl halftime performance, her studded boots dangling midair as she is hoisted to the stadium rafters. But it’s her cyclonic private life that fascinates as a multitude of producers, publicists, masseuses, doctors and makeup artists help manage her workday and the pain caused by a hip fracture in 2013. Still, being the woman born Stefani Germanotta can be deafening in its loneliness. “I go from everyone touching me all day, and talking at me all day,” she says, “to total silence.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/arts/television/lady-gaga-and-netflix-documentary.html

We live each day knowing that we will die, but most of us find it easy enough, and more than congenial, to forget about it. To be told that you have two years or one year or six months left is to be excused from a paradise of ignorance into rude knowledge. And yet to have this appointment in Samarra inked on your schedule is also a kind of blessing or special power. We expect that those facing death ought to live a little differently because of it. They have an opportunity, or so we think — to put things right, to make reparations and bequests and ‘‘arrangements.’’ To book a special experience, long desired but deferred. To prepare a statement. For artists, the knowledge that the end is beckoning may provoke a last surge of inspiration to begin or complete final works, works that invariably come to acquire an extra significance, no matter how flawed the works themselves.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/t-magazine/art/artists-final-last-works.html

2017-09-15,T Magazine Editors on Things They’re Into Right Now,"Fashion collaborations can feel like calculated mismatches meant to surprise you with their own improbability. Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos have taken the opposite approach, filling a pop-up shop in a South Kensington, London townhouse with design pieces by people they already love and collect: their friends. It’s an impressive group that includes Martino Gamper, famous for his 3D drawing project “100 Chairs in 100 Days,” whose button-top stools figure in the space, and his wife, the sculptor Francis Upritchard, who helped choose a vibrant orange for the walls. The shade reminded Pilotto and de Vos of houses they’d seen on a recent trip to Lima, Peru (“we’re currently in a South America phase,” Pilotto says). Elsewhere is a hand-knotted rug with a painterly diamond motif from Ecuador, an actual painting by Peter McDonald and a bench that the designer Bethan Laura Wood covered with a rainbow-hued patchwork textile. It’s a perfect complement to the brand’s latest ready-to-wear collection, which Pilotto describes as “tropical-baroque” and includes quilted microfiber jackets and an asymmetrical dress embroidered with chenille yarn. One day, he and de Vos were in the studio of the glassblower Jochen Holz and found themselves drawn to a series of glass coat hooks Holz had made, which Holz has now remade for them as a series of sculptural glass-drop earrings and cuffs. “It was about playing with different materials and seeing what we could do,” says Pilotto. “And just such a natural dialogue between disciplines.” Fittingly, the shop will stay open through fashion week, the London Design Festival and Frieze. 3 Cromwell Pl., London — KATE GUADAGNINO ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/t-magazine/peter-pilotto-jw-anderson-uniqlo-editors-picks.html

This was during that sweet spot of Korean immigration in America — a decade or so after the arrival of the first major waves but before their descendants bastardized the cuisine with their kimchi tacos. In those days, there was a mystical angle to some of the television dramas the channel showed, which were creepier and more experimental than today’s Korean versions of ‘‘This Is Us.’’ One evening, I watched one of these dramas, which happened to co-star a ghost — a woman in white standing hunched over in a swampy rice field.

Designed by the New Haven, Conn., firm Gray Organschi Architecture with Aaron Schiller, founder of the New York City-based Schiller Projects, the home, which was built for Schiller’s family, is clad in approximately 80 charred louvers he torched entirely by hand. The striking ebony hue feels at once ancient and modern: Here is the enveloping matte darkness of Anish Kapoor’s Vantablack paint and the glittering primordial obsidian of lava rock. In the foggy early morning light, as the heavy marine layer rolls off the Atlantic, the house emerges dark and startling, as though it was dipped in oil. At other times of day, its opaque blackness, which seems to absorb all the light that surrounds it, acts as a kind of backdrop for the sky’s quicksilver mood changes.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/t-magazine/shou-sugi-ban.html

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro’s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers.

Yet mindfulness — moment to moment, nonjudgmental awareness — may be exactly what your body most needs when you are run down and under the weather.

Since stress compromises our immune system, becoming caught up in this way can slow down our recovery. Instead, aim to approach your illness with care, seeing things as they are, with acceptance and compassion.” — Mark Bertin, M.D., a doctor specializing in developmental pediatrics.",Well,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/well/mind/how-to-be-mindful-when-you-are-sick.html

She spent two days just wandering the grounds, where contemporary sculptures (a monumental steel chair covered in antlers, a tiny wood house in a clearing) by the likes of Marina Abramovic, Robert Wilson and Maya Lin stand amid tall beech trees and, in some cases, grazing cows. (The art foundation shares the land with a working dairy farm.) Deep in the woods, Holzer found herself thinking of ‘‘fairy tales light and dark.’’ Then she came upon a waist-high stone wall that dates to the 1700s. ‘‘I started following it and knew it was the site,’’ she says. Her contribution to what is now known as ‘‘Wanas Wall’’ was to carve a different phrase or truism from her past work into a stone block every 20 feet or so. ‘‘all things are delicately interconnected,’’ reads one.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/t-magazine/design/european-art-parks-sculpture.html

Hidden Turkey). According to one advertising executive’s blog, its distinction was to offer “off-the-beaten-track Turkish holidays for the discerning middle classes” — some hotel rooms were $300 a night, but “class” is a moving target — and for those Britons who, the executive imagined, “wanted to feel they were getting away from the crowds,” who craved “an authentic experience.” Glorious boutique hotels sprang up along the shores of the Mediterranean and the Aegean, their multiterraced buildings cascading down Turkey’s mountain slopes to the water’s edge. The website promised rooms that had windows big enough to let in entire seas and real Turkish breakfasts while you watched the graceful gulet boats drift by. It’s Turkey. Turkey is magical.

Mark Rothko, for example, wanted viewers to stand close to his paintings, to be enveloped by their hues, to have a mythic, transcendent experience with his work.

Part of that is due to the extreme compression of her poems, which strip away everything inessential, greatly magnifying the potency of each individual word. She puts an extraordinary pressure on language by her parsimoniousness. But she restricted not only her language very narrowly — apparently, she restricted her life very narrowly, too. Out of this came a body of poetry that really has no equivalent in American literature.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/books/review/marilynne-robinson-on-finding-the-right-word.html

He puts a snowball in his pocket and is sad when, after his bath, it’s gone. But the next day he’s delighted that it has snowed again.

Norton’s “Cisco Pike,” Monte Hellman’s “Cockfighter,” Ridley Scott’s “Alien” and Howard Deutch’s “Pretty in Pink,” as well as Mr. Stanton’s first real lead, in Alex Cox’s “Repo Man” (1984), and his breakthrough months later as a mostly silent drifter yearning to reconnect with his estranged family in Wim Wenders’s “Paris, Texas.” Mr. Stanton won the part after he confessed to its writer Sam Shepard, who died in July, in a Santa Fe bar that he longed “to play something of some beauty or sensitivity.” (quadcinema.com)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/movies/harry-dean-stanton-retrospective-quad-cinema.html

The trip produced Latinized versions of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse in Disney films and accusations of cultural imperialism by Latin American artists.

But Cappellini wasn’t looking for fire; he was looking for Facco, to whom he offered a job on the spot. And thus began a new collaboration, the latest in a long line for Cappellini, who has supported young talent since he joined his family’s forward-thinking Milan-based brand in 1979.

When you are immature, every bad thing can feel like a crisis, and every good thing like ecstasy; the rest of the world watches us with a sense of weariness and unflappability that is earned only after many centuries of witnessing governments and empires and civilizations and self-styled saviors rise, crescendo and tumble.

There was almost nothing left but the barest traces of Leiter’s life — boxes of photographs, a paper lantern, an unfinished sketchbook, a lonely chair — which Halard documents in a new book. In the photographs, taken in 2015, the walls are stained and peeling, the floors spattered with paint. One can clearly see the ravages of time. Yet the soft winter light imbues the rooms with a ghostly beauty and Halard’s haunting images convey the presence of the artist and a lost time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/t-magazine/art/saul-leiter-francois-halard.html

2017-09-26,A New York Cheddar Aged to Perfection,"Several years ago, Murray’s Cheese began working with Cornell University to develop an English-style clothbound Cheddar made solely with ingredients from New York State. The classic pale ivory cheese with fruity, citric flavors is now available. Some commercial Cheddars are coated in wax to prevent mold, but using cheesecloth instead allows this Cheddar to develop complex flavors as it ages. The cheese, made in very small batches at the Cornell Food Processing and Development Laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y., is aged for 12 months in Murray’s ripening caves in Queens. The resulting Cheddar has a creamy, yet firm and slightly crumbly texture. The cow milk comes from the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company in the Hudson Valley and, vegetarians should note, the wheels are rubbed with lard from New York State pigs before the cheesecloth is applied, something that is frequently done when making Cheddar: Murray’s Clothbound Cheddar, $29.99 a pound, murrayscheese.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/dining/new-york-cheddar-murrays-cheese.html

Instead, we fritter away our energy on frivolous distractions! Our inability to focus is framed as weakness, moral failure, neuropathology; as the byproduct of sugar, artificial colors, video games, loopy brain chemistry, social media.

His first order of business was an article about a City Council meeting from the night before, which he hadn’t attended. Brown pulled up a recording of the proceedings and began punching out notes for his weekly article.

He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canada’s Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport.
