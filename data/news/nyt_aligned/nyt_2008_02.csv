2008-02-01,Fine Print | South Africa,"Travel editors get bombarded with glossy imagery every day. No matter the destination — from Qatar to the Caribbean — there’s some attendant glamor shot of a zero-edge pool or a honeymooning couple kicking at shells on the beach at dusk. It’s mind numbing. Then the other day a book passed our desk called South Africa, by a new publishing venture called Well Souled. The volume is a hefty and, yes, glossy 312 pages: images of the country’s people, landscape, architecture, food, fashion, iconography. The founder and editor Mital Shah, a 31-year-old former executive at Vera Wang, says she came across all her subjects solely through word of mouth. “I didn’t cast a wide net. I just let one person lead to the next. And I tried to meet everyone, but I didn’t try to cover everything.” (To document her far-flung network, there’s a “map” of her contacts at the end of the book.) The result is a seductive but not synthetic portrait of a place; we encounter musicians, athletes, and designers, along with children orphaned by AIDS, ordinary citizens, and pinup girls from the pages of 1950s Drum magazine. “I wanted this project to be about being well-traveled but always being soulful about how you travel,” says Shah, who will release books on more countries and who has plans to apply the concept to other media, along with fashion and home design. “We want to offer luxury and culture at the same time — and always be giving back.” To put its money where its passport is Well Souled will give 20 percent of the sales of South Africa to organizations that help AIDS orphans; the same percentage from a book about India will go toward rural education. “It’s a big number, but we wanted to put that stake in the ground.” We’re feeling that.

In the Democratic field, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are each hoping to pile up a decisive number of delegates and end in one night what has been a protracted and increasingly unkind competition. If the Democratic voters defy the designs of the party, though, and neither candidate can achieve a clear verdict, the battle will then enter a rare and little-understood phase: the scramble for superdelegates. These are the roughly 800 Democratic Party insiders  elected officials, state chairmen, national committee members  who will make up about a fifth of the total delegate count at the convention and who can vote for any candidate they want, regardless of what the voters in primaries and caucuses have said. Superdelegates were invented by the Democrats after the 1980 election in the expectation that in any future close nomination race, they would line up behind the establishment candidate and head off the possibility of a ruinous floor fight at the convention.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/magazine/03wwln-lede-t.html

2008-02-04,Log On. Tune Out.,"One of the oldest and soundest rules in intellectual life is “never get in a parsing contest with a skunk.” It is a principle that the lively, intelligent, combative cultural critic Lee Siegel forgot in autumn 2006, when he gave in to the temptation to respond to comments about him posted on his blog at The New Republic’s Web site. Some of the comments were anonymous and abusive  featuring allegations of chromosomal deficiencies and pedophilia  and Siegel replied under the pseudonym “sprezzatura,” praising his own work and denouncing his critics (“You couldn’t tie Siegel’s shoelaces”). When it emerged that Siegel was sprezzatura, he was pilloried in the blogosphere, suspended by The New Republic and, “in good American fashion,” he writes, rewarded with the opportunity “to write the book on Web culture that I’d long wanted to write.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/books/review/Lanchester-t.html

Tackling the gruesome and the grotesque with gleeful abandon, “The Voyage of the Short Serpent” is an eccentric, slightly maddened and often brutally funny tale of a colony of Roman Catholics marooned in medieval Greenland by the encroachment of a new ice age. Much has been made in France of the fact that its author, Bernard du Boucheron, was 76 years old when “Voyage,” his first novel, was published, and there’s something oddly triumphal about the way the narrative takes direct aim at death  which, despite its omnipresence (the bodies pile up rapidly) is never entirely conceded to.

2008-02-04,Nonfiction Chronicle ,"A VIEW OF THE OCEAN, by Jan de Hartog. (Pantheon, $17.95.) In this slim memoir, Hartog, a noted novelist and playwright who died in 2002, sketches his mother: she’s the girl beneath the flowering cherry, the piously forbearing housewife and the white-haired “mischievous saint,” attested doer of good works in Japanese prison camp and Dutch retirement home alike. But at its heart, “A View of the Ocean” is an unsparing account of her death. De Hartog was a sort of northern European Hemingway: a best-selling novelist and legitimate hero of the Dutch resistance before he turned 30. But for all his physical and moral courage, he couldn’t bear nursing his mother in the last weeks of her life. He breaks down in the attempt  and the simple rhythm of his prose turns to a howl. In particular, he’s undone by the stench of her cancerous breath: “It defeated everything in me that wanted to help, to love, to succor.” This is painful to read, but that pain is necessary to understand why de Hartog  though a lifelong skeptic  turns to prayer, and to believe in the religious revelation that follows. The ending suggests he will convert to Quakerism. In fact, he did, adamantly, and went on to write several well-regarded novels about that faith.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/books/review/Wilson-t.html

Although some scholars criticized (and continue to criticize) its findings, politicians, parents and teachers began to re-evaluate how they treated young boys and girls. Gilligan was named to the first professorship in gender studies at Harvard. Jane Fonda credits the book with changing her life. Many other women would agree.

2008-02-04,Paperback Row,"THE VIEW FROM CASTLE ROCK: Stories, by Alice Munro. (Vintage International, $14.95.) Munro (right) based her 12th collection of stories on family records extending back to their origin in the Scottish lowlands. “They were not memoirs but they were closer to my own life than the other stories I had written,” she explains in a foreword. “You could say that such stories pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on.” In the book’s second half, Munro moves toward the present and her typical themes: class, domesticity, sexual desire and the tensions between ambition and loyalty, duty and dreaming. Our reviewer, A. O. Scott, said Munro is incapable of writing a sentence that is “sloppy, dishonest, unnecessary or dull.” Another story collection  his first  comes from Colm Toibin, the author of five novels, including “The Master.” All nine of the tales in MOTHERS AND SONS: Stories (Scribner, $14) contain a mother and son, but rarely are they together. Instead, Toibin is interested in people in hiding from themselves and their feelings, and in the relationship between the watcher and the watched. Writing in the Book Review, Pico Iyer found that “Toibin’s craft is immaculate,” and that the stories are “beautiful and echoing,” but warned that despite its title, “this is not ... a collection to share with your loved ones on the second Sunday in May.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

The only way to save these people is to throw a switch that will divert the train to another track. This will save the five, but unfortunately will kill another person standing on the second track. Now imagine the same runaway trolley and the same five people, but this time you are standing on a bridge above the track, next to a very large stranger. The only way to stop the trolley is to shove the man off the bridge and into the trolley’s path, killing him but saving the five. (It won’t help to jump yourself; you’re too small to stop the trolley.) What is interesting is that both situations present the option of saving five by killing one, but most people respond to them differently. Most believe that you would be right to throw the switch, yet wrong to push the man. But why do we think this? And are we right to do so?

Making pudding, on the other hand, is a different kind of exercise in stretching time  a pleasant one. The five minutes spent in front of a stove, dragging a wooden spatula across the pan to ward off scorched spots and looking for that subtle thickening that seizes the custard just before all-out lumps break out, are elastic, meditative, (ideally) unbothered  a reminder that sometimes the comfort of a comfort food has less to do with eating than it does with cooking.

The Holocaust is not a theme to be made into a musical.” He said that the foundation had not opposed earlier film, theater and television adaptations because they were considered “realistic.” He noted, however, that the foundation had no recourse against the musical because it does not quote from the diary. Rafael Alvero, the director and developer of “The Diary of Anne Frank: A Song to Life,” scheduled to open on Feb. 28 at the Calderón Theater in Madrid, insisted that the show was “very faithful” to the diary. He had support from the Anne Frank Foundation, which operates the museum in the building where the Frank family and others hid, and said the show would spread a message of tolerance.

The shooting occurred about 5:30 a.m., after a vehicle with four occupants pulled up in front of the house, on North 12th Street, and two of the four went to the front door. “Apparently, the suspects were mistakenly searching the wrong residence for someone they were going after,” said Paul M. Loriquet, a spokesman for the prosecutor. The officer, whose name was not released, was getting ready for work at the house, which belongs to a friend or relative, when he heard the banging and answered the door, taking his service pistol with him, Mr. Loriquet said. One of the men at the door, Khalif Cousar, 29, of East Orange, pointed a loaded handgun at the officer, who fired three times, killing Mr. Cousar, Mr. Loriquet said. No one else was injured. The three suspects were being questioned on Sunday. Mr. Loriquet said that after a preliminary investigation, it appeared the shooting was justified.

A competitive field of Democratic candidates was reflected in earlier fund-raising and more aggressive spending through early 2003.

The New York Post praises them as “Supermen!” while The Daily News blares “Champs” on their front covers. Giants quarterback Eli Manning, arguably played more like Brady than Brady himself, and was awarded the most valuable player award only a year after his older brother, Peyton Manning, won it while leading the Indianapolis Colts to the championship.The newspapers dissect the heart-stopping game (the lead switched three times during the final quarter). The Patriots defense crumbled in the fourth quarter, which proved telling given that the Giants’ aggressive defense shut down what was perhaps the best offense in the history of football. While the Giants were universally deemed the underdog, Plaxico Burress, who caught the game-winning touchdown, exhibited prescience in his pre-game prediction of a low-scoring game with a small margin of victory in favor of the Giants (off by the winning margin, off by the exact score, but close enough that everyone is praising him). The Giants had walked away with a sense of confidence and strategy after their 38-35 loss to the Patriots in December, feeling perhaps they knew how to beat the undefeated Patriots.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/now-thats-a-super-duper-bowl-new-york/

2008-02-04,The End of Something,"There’s been talk here about what “The Moviegoer” generated. But I think it’s also worth considering how it represents the end of something. As we’ve seen, Aunt Emily — standing in for William Alexander Percy — stands for the end of the Southern Way, for a certain noblesse oblige that had already been swept aside by history by the time the book was written, and which Percy can only salute in passing. And Binx himself represents a certain kind of self-conscious Southern protagonist who isn’t quite an anti-hero but is self-conscious, well aware of his limitations and foibles — if he doesn’t in fact revel in them. He’s wounded and he knows it and he loves himself for it — he’s a noble Confederate junior officer ill-equipped for life in the squalid Union, and proud of it. He too has been swept away by the tides of progress — and Percy’s later fiction, from the perfectly-titled “The Last Gentleman” on, bears witness to his noble, doomed trajectory.

2008-02-06,The Featherweights,"I’m glad we have a show in New York that’s generating some debate—Halston, of course. There’s nothing in my review tomorrow about Jil Sander, though I did wonder if the tulle-veiled tweed and embroidered skirts, etc. at Herrera and Oscar started with Raf Simons’ transparency collection for spring. I think the only point of comparison between Sander and Halston is that both designers had to clean house a bit with their brands, find the main points. (I hate that dreaded word DNA; I expect to find bodies.) After two or three seasons of establishing a line and his tailoring, as well as the great dresses, Simons has felt free to do more with Jil. I suspect Marco Zanini will do the same thing. The guy is smart, and not affected by the side-show dramas. And look at all the boxy, flaring and embellished jackets we’ve seen on the runways this week—the oversized grunge plaid at Preen, the A-line shapes at Herrera, the tweed numbers at Oscar. And who does a super-simple, sharp-shouldered, one-button jacket with a slim skirt (on Freja) and makes it look new? Mister Zanini. That was my favorite look in the show. It’s all about knowing what to eliminate. I agree with Marco about the 70s context thing, though I looked at it differently in the review. Halson was not about the furnishings; he was about the architecture: line and cut, and color for visual impact and warmth. So what was Liza M. doing in the front row? Why do the new owners feel they have to sell Halston by telling the history? It’s such an old approach. ",Fashion & Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/the-featherweights/

About two-thirds of the references put drugs, alcohol and tobacco in a positive light by associating them with sex, partying and humor, the study said. Some genres, like rap and country in comparison with pop, have more references than others. The team used Billboard charts to identify the most popular songs of 2005, based on sales and airplay. They selected the 279 most popular from country, pop, R&B, rap and rock to examine for references to drugs, alcohol and tobacco. One third had explicit references; 42 percent had some kind of substance abuse reference.

2008-02-06,Artists Rally for Spiral Jetty in Utah,"An oil company’s plan to begin exploratory drilling near the remote site of Robert Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty” along the Great Salt Lake in Utah has stirred an impassioned response from artists and others who fear that the project could endanger that massive artwork. The jetty, a 1,500-foot-long curlicue of salt crystals, rocks and mud jutting into the lake, was completed by Smithson in 1970, three years before he died in a plane crash. The State of Utah, which must approve any plan for drilling in the area, decided recently to extend a period for public comment on the proposal until Feb. 13. John Harja, who runs the state’s public land policy coordinating office, said on Tuesday that the office had received 900 letters, e-mail messages and calls about the issue in the last several days. Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, issued a statement calling the jetty “a significant cultural site” and saying that the trust was “deeply concerned about the potential harm that energy development could bring” to it.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/arts/06arts-ARTISTSRALLY_BRF.html

The Turkish Foreign Ministry called for an “extensive investigation” into the disaster on Sunday, in which nine people, five of them children, were killed, and a baby was tossed from a third floor window to save its life. All were Turks. The German Interior Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, accepted the Turkish government’s offer to send its own fire experts to take part in the investigation. A police spokesman said investigators had not been able to enter the building because it was so badly damaged that it was in danger of collapsing. Arson has not been ruled out. Investigators were interviewing two girls who said they saw a man start the fire.

This was a little surreal. I mean, I’ve seen Cruise and Holmes at other parties. I remember seeing Cruise at a Vanity Fair Oscar party when he was married to Nicole Kidman. But it was funny seeing him last night, because Demi Moore swept up with Ashton Kushner and gave Cruise a big bear hug. I stepped around them, and saw Gwyneth Paltrow. People had that deer-in-the-headlights look: “It’s Gwyneth.” I thought she looked beautiful. I saw Narciso Rodriguez and Diane von Furstenberg, who was with her husband Barry Diller. The place was packed. The dinner crowd moved into a tent set up on the U.N. lawn, and, as Madonna reminded everyone, when she made her speech, we weren’t technically in the United States anymore.",Fashion & Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/fashion-nation/

While the greenhouse basics remain clear (more CO2 = warmer world), the connection between the trend and dramatic events on short time scales — the kind that catch our attention — remains murky, at best. None of this means global warming is unimportant to address. All of this, though, does illustrate the challenge facing those trying to jog the public to respond now to limit a long-term risk. There is no single smoking gun. It remains more a Seurat-style pointillist canvas of evidence. And pointillism does not have the potent punch of, say, “The Scream.”Tornadoes: There was a spate of Instanet attacks on Senator John Kerry yesterday for discussing projections of stronger storms in a warming world in the context of the catastrophic tornado strikes. His comment was nuanced, but by even bringing climate policy into a conversation on severe weather, he was probably destined to get roughed up. The reason?

2008-02-08,A Party Divided?,"The modern nomination system was designed to prevent us from getting to exactly where we are right now; the point of moving up the first few contests every four years, soon followed with a Super Tuesday payoff, was to try to head off the kind of protracted fights to the convention that had doomed the Republicans in 1976 and the Democrats in 1980. And for the last few decades, at least, it worked. But here, once again, come the chaotic winds of democracy to derail the efficient engine of party politics. The Democratic race, in particular, could go all the way to Denver, and it could end ugly—perhaps with super delegates hijacking the convention, or with lawyers arguing about whether Florida and Michigan should be seated.The accepted wisdom about such drawn-out, titanic clashes—and the reason that insiders have worked so hard to preclude them—is that they are ruinous for a party. The failures of sitting presidents like Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter (as well as challengers like Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale) are said to have proven that parties riven by internal disputes in the summer are incapable of reuniting in the fall; a nominee needs time before the convention to soothe feelings, raise money and recast himself for the general election. This year, though, the accepted wisdom is at least half wrong. That is, it probably still holds true for Republicans, but it could be a mistake to assume the same about Democrats.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/a-party-divided/

Chronic headaches are my fate, and I have adopted a position of philosophical resignation. I am aware that such a view is resoundingly un-American. Our culture does not encourage anyone to accept adversity. On the contrary, we habitually declare war on the things that afflict us, whether it’s drugs, terrorism, or cancer. Our media fetishizes the heart-warming stories of those who, against all odds, never lose hope and fight their way to triumph over poverty, addiction, disease. The person who lies back and says, “This is my lot. So be it,” is a quitter, a passive, pessimistic, spineless loser who deserves only our contempt.

The cyberspace mea culpa comes from Gina McCauley, a lawyer whose site WhatAboutOurDaughters.blogspot.com has admonished BET for misogynistic and racially insensitive programming. But Ms. McCauley said on Thursday that the five months of protests led by a group calling itself Enough Is Enough now lacked specificity and impact. “I thought this was more like the Montgomery bus boycott, but going into the sixth month, this looks more like the Salem witch trials or ‘The Scarlet Letter,’ ” Ms. McCauley said in an e-mail message. The protests are led by Baptist ministers who say that BET broadcasts music videos that degrade women and black and Latino men. After focusing on Ms. Lee, the protest rallies spread to the Upper East Side home of Philippe Dauman, the president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns BET. The Rev. Delman L. Coates, pastor of the Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, Md., and the protest organizer, said on Thursday that the rallies brought attention and were one weapon in their battle.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/arts/08arts-APOLOGYFORBE_BRF.html

2008-02-11,Budapest Festival Orchestra:Model Orchestra and Orchestra Models,"Take 50 to 100 highly trained musicians, put instruments in their hands, place ’em on stage and charge admission. It’s called an orchestra. But how do you organize them? Pay them? Make use of their time? Keep them happy? Keep audiences happy?All sorts of models exist. I had a chat with Ivan Fischer, who leads the Budapest Festival Orchestra, at a Lincoln Center bakery/eatery on Friday, and he told the story of his group. It sounded pretty special. Now since I have not looked closely at exactly how the orchestra works, it is hard to gauge the reality. But at the least, Mr. Fischer’s description sounded like a fine ideal.The Budapest Festival Orchestra has been around since 1983, when Mr. Fischer, a budding freelance conductor at the time, decided to settle down and helped establish it. But it has not achieved the notice in this country of other top European bands. It has concert dates Friday night and Sunday afternoon as part of Lincoln Center’s Great Performers series.Mr. Fischer’s orchestra, he said, has three cardinal virtues, established at its creation: an emphasis on the players’ individual creativity; few rules, for maximum flexibility; and unusual programming.Thus, on Point 1, the orchestra has internal concerto competitions, so not just principals get to play solos. Players are encouraged to come up with their own chamber music programs. Seating rotates. “More active musicians make a better team,” said Mr. Fischer, who speaks slowly with a Hungarian accent. The no-rules rule means no long-term contracts, no overtime and auditions that end up with five or six finalists who play with the orchestra.Innovative programs mean daylong festivals devoted to a composer; surprise concerts, in which the program is unknown until the players come on stage; and sight-reading concerts, in which a slip of paper is drawn out of a tuba bell with a seat number. The person in that seat then picks the piece. A truck with the orchestra library is waiting outside, so the parts can be delivered. Next season, the orchestra comes to Carnegie Hall with Gypsy musicians.Often readers of material like the above will write in and say, “Gee, that’s all very well, but my orchestra has been doing those things for ages; you failed to mention X, Y and Z.” So consider this an open invitation to comment on ArtsBeat about orchestra models, model orchestras and interesting features of both.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/budapest-festival-orchestramodel-orchestra-and-orchestra-models/

Efforts to be seen as “an individual” necessitate that we differentiate ourselves from some supposedly monolithic black identity and authenticity. Like it or not, our individuality is dependent on first identifying and, depending on where we are coming from and where we are going, either embracing or distancing ourselves from the group.

That same year he also self-published “The Plant”  an ultimately uncompleted serial novel  online, and even adopted an honor system payment plan, predating Radiohead’s stab at this by seven years. The lastest gleam in King’s eye is Kindle, Amazon’s fledgling e-book reader. “I’ve argued all my life that the story means more than the delivery systems involved (and that includes the writer),” King wrote recently in Entertainment Weekly, praising the device. Among other things, he likes that Kindle allows him to increase a book’s type size. His conclusion: “My definition of Kindle: a gadget with stories hiding inside it. What’s wrong with that?” King’s new novel, “Duma Key,” enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 1.

Alone and afraid, he is taken to a police station and pushed into a dark cell. “All about him he could feel the presence of the man who must be in there somewhere.” When a voice in the blackness says, “Why are you here?” relief washes over him. Why? Because it is “the gentle voice of a woman. Suddenly it was as if a great danger had been averted.” As the woman pulls him close to console him, the boy smells sweat and something strangely sweet  perfume, he thinks. But it’s blood. The woman who comforts him is one of the assassins, a “terrorist” in the words of the soldiers who imprisoned her. Her actions led to the death of the boy’s parents, but he doesn’t know that, nor does she. Still, as she holds him, he hears “her heart pound, really much too hard for someone who was just comforting someone else.” Years later, he sobs when he learns she has died: “She was resurrected together with all she had meant to him, hidden there in the darkness.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/books/review/Schillinger-t.html

2008-02-11,The Time of Their Lives,"Campaigning against a president who refused to respond to the growing opposition to a cruel, dishonest war, the charismatic young candidate insisted: “What we need in the United States is not division. What we need in the United States is not hatred. What we need in the United States is ... love and wisdom and compassion toward one another.” That wasn’t last week  it was April 1968, and two months later Robert Kennedy was dead. Opposition to the war continued and broadened after the election of Richard Nixon that fall, but one of the engines of the antiwar movement, Students for a Democratic Society, largely disbanded after a split in 1969; the next year its leaders, gripped by revolutionary fantasies, went underground.

The Zegna family, the sole owner of the company, would eventually decide that it needed something that better told the story of the business, now 98 years old, and went back to the drawing board.

2008-02-11,From One Cuckoo’s Nest to Another,"“IT’S funny to realize, but in my relatively short life I have lived through six or seven different social and cultural systems,” the filmmaker Milos Forman said. “First the Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia, then the limited democracy before World War II, then the Nazi regime. After the Nazi regime there was a kind of democracy again for three years, then came the Stalinist regime, then the reformed Communist regime, and now I am living in a free country.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/movies/10kehr.html

Well-controlled studies of cognitive-behavioral and other types of psychotherapy have shown them to be as effective as medication for certain kinds of psychological problems, like panic attacks. Indeed, for some disorders, cognitive-behavioral therapy may have longer-lasting effects than medication. Experienced psychiatrists know that both psychotherapy and medication have their proper place and often work best when combined.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/magazine/10letters-t-002.html
2008-02-11,Breaking Through," In 2005, at the Sundance Film Festival, a star was born, but almost no one noticed. Well, actually, a few studio executives who saw “Hard Candy” raved about the performance of the unknown Ellen Page  she played an avenging, psychopathic 14-year-old who entices and then violently tortures a would-be pedophile. But the movie was so relentlessly disturbing (at one point, Page’s character ties her enemy down and slowly begins to castrate him) that when “Hard Candy” was released the following year, no one went to see it. What the audience missed then is what they later found in “Juno”  the birth of a different sort of actress. Unlike her glamour-girl peers who double as tabloid superstars, Page, who is now 20, is a tomboy  her on-screen persona is sharp, clear-eyed, determined and self-consciously original. In “Hard Candy,” she managed to be adorable and persuasive while wielding a large knife; in 2007, that same spirit and charm animated “Juno,” a kind of fairy tale about a pregnant 16-year-old who decides to have the baby and give it to the couple (in the end, half the couple) she chooses. In “Juno,” the lack of realism  no one questions Juno’s decision  and the lack of politics are trumped by the overwhelming appeal of Page’s acting. She is so alive on screen  so unique, so ingratiating  that she makes the character, and the entire film, believable.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/magazine/10Oscars-t.html

After months of investigation, Mr. Rovere, in an essay published in 1961, unmasked the establishment’s members  the directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, the head of the Ford Foundation, and so on  and offered a working definition: “A more or less closed and self-sustaining institution that holds a preponderance of power in our more or less open society.” ",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/weekinreview/10confess.html

More than one out of every eight South Africans is H.I.V. positive, Steinberg reports; every day roughly 800 South Africans die of AIDS and more than 1,000 additional people are infected. A recent survey found that in the previous month, the average South African was more than twice as likely to have been to a funeral as to a wedding.

To crack the case, the restaurant has called the Bloodhound Gang of the wine world, the Pétrus Police. … Talk about rip offs, a van Gogh, Monet, Degas and Cézanne were reported stolen a private collection (cost: about $100 million) … Usually Gucci is getting knocked off, not the other way around. The heat is on the luxury brand for its new campaign, an unauthorized homage to Milton Glaser’s I heart NY… Also in legal hot water is Croc, the un-chic shoe manufacturer. The family of a girl whose Croc got chewed up by an escalator is suing for $7 million. Croc has acknowledged, “a long-existing issue that we think is very important — escalator safety.” … For less serious scrapes and cuts, look forward to Band-Aids 2.0, with build-in microchips … Speaking of painful, this week New York Magazine’s Best Bets goes rummaging for 40-year-old junk. … Count us in, maybe, for a round of retail therapy at Damien Hirst’s London “Art Shop.” We can’t afford the $100 million diamond skull, but a second mortgage might afford us a $50,000 painted cranium. … We guess Londoners like to blow their cash on tighty whities.

Estée Lauder attended services there as a young woman, and in 1979 and 1980 Madonna lived nearby in a building that used to be a yeshiva affiliated with the congregation. The two-story, wood-frame synagogue, right, designed by Crescent L. Varrone, at 109-18 54th Avenue in Corona, combines Gothic and Moorish design elements with Judaic ornaments: pointed-arched windows, a roundel with a Star of David in colored glass, and a gabled parapet. The original wooden stoop and railing have been replaced with a brick porch with an iron railing, and the wood clapboard siding has been covered with stucco. The design was modeled after synagogues on the Lower East Side, where the founders of the congregation, established in 1907, had originally lived. In 2002 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also on Tuesday, the commission voted for a third time to designate the Jamaica Savings Bank building, an 1898 Hough & Duell Beaux-Arts structure at 161-02 Jamaica Avenue, in Jamaica, as a landmark. Twice previously, the commission’s landmark designation for that building has been overturned: by the Board of Estimate in 1975, and by the City Council in 1992. The building’s owner has agreed to support the current designation, which is expected to meet with Council approval.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/arts/13arts-CITYLANDMARK_BRF.html

Like many of his intellectual allies, he had ardently supported school vouchers as a way to give poor and minority children better educational choices and to create competition that would help improve public schools. Although colleagues long thought they had him pegged, he made an abrupt about-face on vouchers in the most recent issue of City Journal, the institute’s magazine, saying there was little evidence they had done much to improve public education across the country. In the circles Mr. Stern inhabits, such a sentiment is a kind of heresy, and his essay has set off a firestorm.

2008-02-18,Dream Logic,"“We poets in our youth begin in gladness,” wrote Wordsworth, who might have felt otherwise had he spent his own youth as an adjunct assistant professor of creative writing. If he’d done so, as many younger writers do nowadays, he’d probably have thought twice about pairing “gladness” with a job that often involves $50,000 in student loans and no health insurance. To be fair, it’s never been easy to be a young poet, and teaching creative writing is certainly safer than working as a roofer. Yet because most are neither wealthy (like the young James Merrill) nor constantly in jeopardy (like Villon), writers in their early careers today face a peculiar and sometimes unenviable set of circumstances. On the one hand, the proliferation of M.F.A. programs gives a poet the chance to make a sort-of living from his art; on the other hand, the insularity of that world can tax both an artist’s social skills and his resistance to fashion. Given these difficulties, it’s tempting to replace Wordsworth’s salute to youthful vitality with the 29-year-old Bon Scott’s less optimistic observation: “If you wanna be a star of stage and screen / Look out, it’s rough and mean.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Orr2-t.html

(“Camp” is a local upper-caste understatement, comparable to the use of “cottage” in Newport, R.I.) As the sun begins to dip behind the mountain range that dominates the horizon, a beautiful young woman detaches herself from her elders and walks barefoot to the shore of the lake. Suddenly a seaplane appears in the air and all look on, stunned, as it lands on the surface of the water. Such a thing has never before occurred, and furthermore is taboo under the largely unspoken laws of the reserve. A dashing aviator  we will discover that he is a famous artist, a radical, a free spirit  steps out of the plane and locks eyes with the glamorous yet troubled young woman.

2008-02-18,Presumed Guilty,"Years ago, I asked a class I was teaching to read the first chapters of Balzac’s “Eugenie Grandet” and “A Flag for Sunrise,” by Robert Stone. The Balzac begins with a leisurely tour of a provincial town, while, near the start of the Stone, a hippie backpacker’s corpse shows up in the freezer of an army lieutenant in a restive Central American country. I suggested to my students that the comparison might reflect one difference between 19th- and 20th-century fiction. Perhaps these contrasting openings had something to do with the way our attention spans have been altered  for better or worse  by the bright gratifications of movies and the rhythm of television, which has schooled us to expect the “hook” before the first commercial. Reading “A Person of Interest,” it occurred to me that if we’re lucky, Susan Choi’s new book may turn out to be a prototypical 21st-century novel, combining the unhurried pleasures of certain classics with the jittery tensions of more recent fiction.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Prose-t.html

The true folklore, however, is the perception that our new economy represents progress. Middle-class Americans borrow to maintain their standard of living, as well-paid manufacturing jobs, like machinists, are replaced by lower-paid “new economy” jobs, like security guards. Masters of the new economy on Wall Street make millions on financial alchemy that ultimately weakens our economy further. One hopes that our next president will recognize that “choreographers, blackjack dealers and security guards” can never form the “backbone” of a strong economy and take steps to revive America’s industrial base.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17letters-t-004.html

Rita Mae Brown is not among these writers. Brown is best known, to some readers, as the author of the groundbreaking lesbian novel “Rubyfruit Jungle,” published in 1973. But in recent years she’s spent her time churning out two successful mystery series, one about a fox-hunting club in Virginia, the other about a sleuthing cat named Mrs. Murphy. (The new Mrs. Murphy novel, “The Purrfect Murder,” enters the fiction list this week at No. 16.) On her Web site, Brown, who is 63 and lives on a farm in Virginia, stares at herself in the mirror and writes: “I suppose I should say something about being older than dirt. Well, I’m working on it. I love it. As long as you’re healthy and have a job, life is really good. Yes, I look like my grandmother. My body hasn’t aged yet, the face has gone, but ... I was never going to make the cover of Vogue. And in those moments when a flicker of vanity hits me and I think, ‘Damn, I need a facelift,’ I remind myself that there’s a starving hound someone has abandoned and I must catch it, feed it and restore its confidence in the hound-human bond.

Speaking for about 50 demonstrators outside the De Flint theater in Amersfoort, where Mr. Heesters, above, performed, Piet Schouten said: “He kept singing for the Nazi regime, for the Wehrmacht, and he earned millions. Those are facts, and we have a problem with that on behalf of all the victims.” Mr. Heesters was never accused of being a propagandist, and the Allies allowed him to continue his career after World War II. But in the Netherlands he is viewed by some as unforgivable, though he wrote in his postwar autobiography, “I was ashamed of myself, and I still haven’t stopped feeling this way.” In 1964 he was booed off the stage in Amsterdam when he appeared as the Nazi-hating Captain von Trapp in “The Sound of Music.” No disturbances were reported during the concert in Amersfoort, where Mr. Heesters, who lives in Germany, was born.

2008-02-18,Milan: Please Don’t Come,"Although I am holding an invitation to Giorgio Armani’s show today, at noon, I know I am not expected. Yesterday, shortly after I pulled the covers over my head for a little nap, I received an email from Robert Triefus, who is Armani’s head of communications. It was marked urgent and inquired if I had received a letter from Armani. I had not, but it didn’t take a genius to know what the letter was about. Armani had decided not to invite me to his show and, of course, that was the intent of the letter, once I had read it. He didn’t like the tone of my comments about his January couture show in Paris; specifically, he thought I was “belittling” of his family and friends. I had described their appearance and manner in the moments before the show. It was pretty innocuous stuff. Armani, though, didn’t think so. I asked Triefus why Armani had waited until just before today’s show to say something; the couture reviews had come out two or three weeks ago. Triefus said Armani had become preoccupied with his ready-to-wear show—we’re up to fall 2008—and hadn’t had time to return to the matter until now. “That’s our fault,” Triefus said.

Lured by the subsidized rent offered by the developer David Walentas, in recent months, Verso, the leftie British press, and Melville House, the literary publisher, have moved to Dumbo, and the upstart literary quarterly N+1 is on its way. The London-based New Left Review has some space in Verso’s office, and the London Review of Books is also said to have scouted out space there.

The decision should pave the way for sale of the book in Japan for the first time in eight years. Although it decided that the book was not indecent, the Supreme Court rejected a demand by the publisher, Uplink, for government compensation of $20,370, according to Takashi Ando, a spokesman for the court. Takashi Asai of Uplink had been contesting the confiscation of the book in 1999 and his voluntary suspension of its sales in 2000 in response to police warnings. In the Supreme Court decision, by a majority of the five-judge bench, Justice Kohei Nasu wrote that the 384-page volume of black-and-white portraits, including 20 close-ups of male genitalia, “compiles work from the artistic point of view, and is not obscene as a whole.” Mr. Asai sold about 900 copies of the Japanese version of “Mapplethorpe,” originally published in Japan by Random House in 1994 without objection from the authorities. But airport customs officials, declaring the book obscene, confiscated Mr. Asai’s copy when he returned from a trip to the United States in 1999. He called the Supreme Court decision “groundbreaking” and said it “could change the obscenity standard” used for banning foreign films that depict nudity and for censoring photographs in books.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/arts/20arts-SUPREMECOURT_BRF.html

But, as Paul Gambaccini points out in a comment, she is essential to the symmetry of the play. In the prologue, Beverly quotes T.S. Eliot’s poem “The Hollow Men” to her: “Life is very long.” And in that final scene, when Violet has finally driven the last of her daughters away, Johnna sings to her from the last lines of the same poem: “This is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends.” (Eliot’s punchline, not spoken in the play but entirely relevant: “Not with a bang but a whimper.”)",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/the-indian-in-the-attic/

A prosecution witness painstakingly presented the court with photographs and documents on Wednesday in an effort to establish that more than a dozen looted artifacts had made their way into the Getty’s collection. Marion True, the former Getty curator, is charged with conspiring to acquire illicitly excavated antiquities for the museum. Several of the pieces discussed on Wednesday by the prosecution witness, Daniela Rizzo, are now on view at the presidential palace in Rome as part of an exhibition of objects recovered from American museums in the last two years. Ms. Rizzo repeatedly projected an image of an artifact onto a screen next to a photograph of the same piece in a dirt-encrusted, unrestored state. For most of the pieces, she said, acquisition documents provided by the Getty did not cite the object’s provenance. “If it came from an authorized dig, it would say so and give a date,” she said. “The fact that it doesn’t makes you think, doesn’t it?” Ms. True and the American dealer Robert Hecht, who is on trial with her on similar charges, have both proclaimed their innocence.

2008-02-21,Playing by Party Rules,"When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he talked, memorably and incessantly, about protecting those families who “worked hard and played by the rules.” Sixteen years later, it appears ever more likely that the outcome of this year’s Democratic nomination fight will rest, in the end, on how party leaders interpret the rules. As I’ve written here before, there is no real ideological divide in the party; most Democrats would seem to be satisfied with either Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama, so there’s no reason to think either candidate’s followers will automatically revolt if they lose. But no matter who wins, if the process itself ends up confirming the growing suspicion among voters that the rules are only there to be rigged, then the outcome could devastate a party whose central argument is all about fairness. Much has been written about the possible permutations in the Democratic race from here on out, but at this point it’s fairly simple. After his victories Tuesday, Mr. Obama now has a slim but hard-to-surmount lead in “pledged delegates” — those awarded in state contests. If Mrs. Clinton were to win the trio of Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania by huge margins, then she might be able to overtake him, but that doesn’t seem terribly likely, given the dynamic of the race right now. Even so, neither candidate has much chance of emerging from the primaries with the 2,025 delegates needed to lock up the nomination, which means that even if Mr. Obama maintains his lead, Mrs. Clinton can—and probably will—fight on.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/playing-by-party-rules/

If the two detectives can prove that they were not acting recklessly or with criminal intent in firing their first shots at Mr. Bell and his friends in Queens on Nov. 25, 2006, then the shots that followed — 40 more rounds between them — could be determined to be justified as well, said lawyers who have represented police officers in the past and people who have been briefed on the case.

Seeking to shore up its finances, Fisk agreed in principle last fall to sell a 50 percent stake in the collection to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., for $30 million. But on Feb. 8 Ellen Hobbs Lyle, a Davidson County Chancery Court judge, struck down that proposal, saying it went against the donor’s wishes.

And, really, is there anyone better to learn that pitch from than Koufax? But Koufax has a very special relationship with Pedro Martinez, who met Koufax about 20 years ago when he was a 17-year-old in Dodgertown, up in Vero Beach, for the first time. Pedro spoke about that relationship with us today. Some of it you’ll see in my story, but Pedro was so fantastic speaking about the subject that it would be unfair for baseball fans not to read more.

Its origins date to the time when a chap named Alex Collins studied abroad and lived on a commune where many garments were communal property. Eager to recreate back home that “year of my life when not having possessions didn’t bother me,” Collins held a party at which guests were told to swap outfits every time a whistle blew. The mayhem inspired Eloise Markwell-Butler, Dean Slydell, Dani Mazzer and Nick Frew to take the concept public, aided by donations from the vintage megastore Beyond Retro. Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is now held at Favela Chic in the Shoreditch neighborhood once every month. Clotheslines festoon the club, and when the klaxon sounds, you either swap or split: ogling bystanders are evicted. Markwell-Butler likens it to “being in a mad person’s laundry.” Since partygoers keep their booty, at £3 for admission, it’s London’s cheapest way to get a new wardrobe.

Highlights of the itinerary include attending the Mass Games, a color-coded, athletic performance organized by the state, and visiting sites like Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the mausoleum of Kim Il-Sung.

For him, meticulous observation does the work of psychology. Millhauser is also our foremost animist: in his stories, mannequins walk out of department store windows and figures in paintings knock hats off innocent bystanders. His vehicles for these effects are the parable and the confession. There is a disquieting quiet to every Millhauser sentence that makes it immediately recognizable, a feeling that each was recorded for posterity by the last man living.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Max-t.html

If we say, “The king died and then the queen died,” we have two events. If we add that the queen died of grief, we have a story, and a good one because the reader has a reason to care. This maxim (McCullough borrowed it from E. M. Forster) is less helpful when there’s no royal paper trail. Can history assume the queen’s grief because it makes a good story?

2008-02-25,Don’t Go There,"As the author of more than 20 contentious volumes of criticism, George Steiner hasn’t exactly been one to hold back. Yet some projects have been too sensitive, difficult or doomed for him to undertake. His new collection of essays, “My Unwritten Books,” offers blueprints and eulogies for seven books he says he’ll never write, on topics including his Jewish identity, teaching, animals and politics. These essays are not imaginary CliffsNotes; they stand alone and reveal Steiner at his most complex: irascible and passionate, erudite and self-absorbed, determined to engage the most difficult cultural problems. His lyric fury is sharpest in “School Terms,” in which he surveys educational practices across the globe  then takes a flamethrower to them. Steiner, who taught at a string of top institutions before settling down at Harvard, then Cambridge, ultimately proposes an übersyllabus that would gorge us on the world’s diverse knowledge.

Inscriptions on the worn, fragile silk indicated that through the centuries it had been among the treasured possessions of princes, emperors and connoisseurs.

At no time had it cultivated or mined or manufactured any good; it acted, rather, as merchant, factor, broker, financier. At its beginnings, it imported the axes that it traded for wampum, which it traded for beaver skins, which it sold for export. Later on, it bought corn and wheat from the farms of the north and sent its ships laden with them to the Caribbean, where they exchanged their cargo for sugar, rum, molasses, and indigo, which, on the ships' return, Beeche re-exported to the east and west; sometimes, the eastbound ships, after first calling in Britain or France, traveled down to the African coast and then sailed back across the Atlantic with cargo that was human. Beeche was among the first in New York to trade commercial and government paper, and as the years passed it added the securities of banks, then of railroads, then of manufacturers, to its repertoire. By the turn of the last century the firm had grown into a large financial enterprise with thousands of employees, branches throughout the world, and a dozen divisions. Yet its basic business remained the same: trading for its own benefit and brokering the trades of others. No Beeche had touched a plow or a hammer for centuries, nor had he employed anyone who did.

But those looking to combine their altruism with a little swag need not have worried  Giannini also designed two bag collections for the occasion: “Heritage” (left) plays up Gucci’s history with a rendition of a print from the 1950s, while “New York Exclusive” pays tribute to the Big Apple, with all proceeds benefiting the Central Park playgrounds.

Just across the valley, lights flickered from a few homes nestled in the terraced farmlands of Yaka China, a notorious village in the Korengal River valley in Afghanistan’s northeastern province of Kunar. Yaka China was just a few villages south and around a bend in the river from the Americans’ small mountain outposts, but the area’s reputation among the soldiers was mythic. It was a known safe haven for insurgents. American troops have tended to avoid the place since a nasty fight a year or so earlier. And as Halloween approached, the soldiers I was with, under the command of 26-year-old Capt. Dan Kearney, were predicting their own Yaka China doom.

Now, through the London interior design company Beaudesert and the archives of Ascher Studio, reproductions of Beaton’s checks, florals and stripes are being sold at Liberty of London. The Cecil Beaton fabric collection  on silk, cotton, linen and wallpaper  was inspired by a scarf that Beaudesert’s managing director, Andrew Ginger, found on eBay; Beaton had originally designed it for the textile firm Ascher. In the 1940s and early ’50s, Zika Ascher commissioned artists such as Henri Matisse and Henry Moore to design fabrics, paying them £25 per motif, according to his son, Peter. All the big designers, like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Lanvin and Yves Saint Laurent, would buy their fabrics from Ascher Studio. Although not known for his brush strokes, Beaton was an obvious choice for fabric, and Zika allowed him free rein. “An artist with a color sense is not someone you mess with,” Zika has been quoted as saying.

2008-02-25,The Sound and the Führer,"Among the many acid pleasures of the work of Roberto Bolaño, who died at 50 in 2003, is his idea that culture, in particular literary culture, is a whore. In the face of political repression, upheaval and danger, writers continue to swoon over the written word, and this, for Bolaño, is the source both of nobility and of pitch-black humor. In his novel “The Savage Detectives,” two avid young Latino poets never lose faith in their rarefied art no matter the vicissitudes of life, age and politics. If they are sometimes ridiculous, they are always heroic. But what can it mean, he asks us and himself, in his dark, extraordinary, stinging novella “By Night in Chile,” that the intellectual elite can write poetry, paint and discuss the finer points of avant-garde theater as the junta tortures people in basements? The word has no national loyalty, no fundamental political bent; it’s a genie that can be summoned by any would-be master. Part of Bolaño’s genius is to ask, via ironies so sharp you can cut your hands on his pages, if we perhaps find a too-easy comfort in art, if we use it as anesthetic, excuse and hide-out in a world that is very busy doing very real things to very real human beings.

Mountains of smoke rose to the sky, and mountains of flame came seething down to the earth; every jet that struck the ground turned into a volcano, and rose again, higher than before; the whole mass, boiling and bursting, became a river of fire, a lava flood that went streaming down the valley, turning everything it touched into flame, then swallowing it up and hiding the flames in a cloud of smoke.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Essay-t.html

2008-02-25,Early Bloomers,"There were a few blousy moments during the spring collections when you could be forgiven for thinking you were attending an 1850s suffragist rally or a gym class at Vassar in the 1920s. Bloomers  sometimes diaperish, usually subversive and most women’s idea of fashion hell  produced smirks and double-takes in New York and Europe. Gaultier’s iteration had a “Pirates of Penzance” picturesqueness. In an unusually insane show, Comme des Garçons advanced the possibility of bloomers that were not just frilly but also falling apart. Prada’s take, short-short and sewn in shiny fabrics, was straight from the stroller. Betsey Johnson, well, you can guess. While today’s bloomers can be traced in a straight line to the pumpkin breeches that Renaissance men wore at the top of their hose, they are but fuzzy cousins to the garment favored by the early women’s libber who lent them her name, Amelia Bloomer. She rebelled against the petticoats and floor-grazing skirts of the mid-19th century in favor of knee-skimming designs layered over ballooning trousers gathered at the ankles. The bifurcated look had something weirdly haremlike about it and, however liberating, was light only in relation to what had come before. Bloomer was ridiculed but of course vindicated with the hindsight of history. Designers have fallen in and out of love with bloomers at least since 1976. Bonnie Cashin, the sportswear pioneer, celebrated the bicentennial with a collection of “Amelias.” “Bonnie loved bloomers because they could be completely customized by the wearer,” says Stephanie Lake of the Bonnie Cashin Foundation. Is there any designer who hasn’t dabbled in bloomers? You can wear out your search engine trying to find one. Saint Laurent’s fling was in 1987. Vivienne Westwood cast her vote in velvet in 1998. Armani has shown bloomers off and on for several years. Spinning positive, one buyer called them a “skirt replacement.” That or gym clothes.[?][?][?]CHRISTOPHER PETKANAS ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/style/tmagazine/24bloomers.html

When I asked to borrow Mom’s dress, she flatly refused, saying that red at a coming-out party went against all codes of etiquette. So I did what any savvy New York girl would do: I called Valentino himself, who was thrilled at the idea of making me the social scandal of the season. He gave me my own gown, and since then, I have worn many more  recently to his anniversary in Rome and to Elton John’s birthday party.

2008-02-25,Jazz Man,"Nearly a century after jazz emerged as a musical form with profound cultural resonance, the jazz novel, like the theater of the absurd and radio drama, seems an archaism, a good subject for a third-year undergraduate elective or a Bravo documentary. When we think of jazz fiction, we think not only of books centered on the music but of work steeped in the jazz aesthetic  an implacably rigorous and cosmopolitan tradition rooted in the blues and the African-American experience, in which obedience to the moment has primacy. We also call to mind writers dating back to the Harlem Renaissance. We think of Langston Hughes and Jean Toomer; and of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose legend is inextricable from the age named for jazz; we think perhaps of Kenneth Rexroth; of Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka; and of Jack Kerouac and his fellow Beats, among many others. We think of past eras in a montage of changing modes of headwear: top hats ... fedoras ... kufis ... berets. But we are unlikely to think immediately of jazz when we think of contemporary literature, and we may well conceive of the act of writing a jazz novel in the 21st century as akin to wearing a hat today  as an affectation, a mark of a retro obsession or a hint that one is trying to hide a certain lack of something up top.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Hajdu-t.html

2008-02-25,Pretty Ugly,"Any aficionado of early Mad comics published during the first half of the 1950s, when Mad was still a riotous comic book and not yet a formatted magazine, will recognize the brilliantly perverse parody of a Life magazine cover featuring a portrait of a hideous girl next to the headline “Beautiful Girl of the Month Reads Mad.” The artist who concocted this misshapen, bug-eyed, fang-toothed, pimply-faced, spaghetti-haired, pig-nosed monstrosity was Basil Wolverton (1909-78), a Mad mainstay who specialized in things ugly. He created Lena the Hyena, a character who appeared in Al Capp’s “L’il Abner” and was known as “the ugliest woman in Lower Slobbovia.” And he was the mastermind behind “Powerhouse Pepper,” a mock-heroic melodrama, as well as covers for GJDRKZLXCBWQ Comics: A Gallery of Gooney Gags and DC Comics’ Mad-like Plop! Always recognizable for unbridled grotesquerie, his art ran the gamut from political satire (“Candid Close-Ups: Hitler”) to goofy science fiction (“Rocket Rider”) to biblical illustrations (for a decade he wrote and illustrated the Bible story, serialized in The Plain Truth magazine, for the Worldwide Church of God). His epic in this last genre was a gory interpretation of Armageddon, complete with horrific atomic aftermaths. He did, however, also produce posters for Topps, the trading card company. While his penchant for extreme physical exaggeration may not have been to everyone’s taste, through Mad he exercised incalculable influence on the history of comics and the perceptions of impressionable preteens, like me. “Gross” was and remains a generational code.

2008-02-25,You Better Werkstatte,"At the Wiener Werkstätte, artists believed that a piece of jewelry should serve as something more personal than an advertisement for wealth. Josef Hoffmann, one of the workshop’s founders, used semiprecious stones including coral and moonstone to create brooches that resembled stained glass (left). His pieces also referred to Gustav Klimt, who happened to be an important patron. The artist Dagobert Peche went a more organic route with nature-inspired bracelets and pendants. “They were thinking in more abstract ways,” says Janis Staggs, who curated the show “Wiener Werkstätte Jewelry,” which opens at the Neue Galerie in New York on March 27. “It was about experimentation of color and pattern.” But not necessarily about perfection.

2008-02-25,Bright Yarn Thing,"Just as her muse Jean-Michel Basquiat used to say, “Believe it or not, I can actually draw,” the British knitwear sensation Clare Tough says she can actually knit. Still, grandmothers everywhere may grumble that some of her graffiti-inspired creations (like her Brooklyn Bridge bra, a skimpy creation in wool and balsa wood) break every rule of the purl-one-knit-two set. Ditto for the zippered cardigan with an overload of ribbed patchwork and vibrant embroideries, which she says has about 50 types of yarn. Tough first got noticed in 2004 with her Central Saint Martins graduation show: the string outfits of Jamaican dancehall queens re-envisioned as cobwebby knit dresses. But her real obsession is ’80s New York, having grown up in the picture-postcard spa town Malvern listening to Fab 5 Freddie and old hip-hop compilations. Tough, 27, is bent on expanding the definition of knitwear. “I didn’t invent crochet, obviously, but I really think the way I patchwork garments together hasn’t been done before,” she says in her East London studio. “Knitting has got a frumpy image, and it really shouldn’t.” [?][?][?]SUSIE RUSHTON THE REMIX",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/style/tmagazine/24tough.html

There had been a divorce and nearly instant remarriages, and my mother, who is relentless and clever about forward motion, realized that where we were living was not where we should be living. This was a shock for many reasons, most of which had to do with the girls in my new sixth-grade class. I had come from the land of saddle shoes, bobby socks and plaid jumpers, and suddenly I was confronted with a world of snobby 11-year-old sophisticates in nylons, heels and miniature versions of their mothers’ ’70s sheaths. I was still a child — I wanted to go trick-or-treating on Halloween, they wanted to play truth or dare with the boys; I was proud of my Girl Scout merit badges, they wanted to wear their green uniforms to entice older boys. But most of all, and most shocking to me, was that they all wore black. Not every day, but for special occasions — class photo, assembly, sixth-grade graduation — and I had never known anyone of any age who wore black for anything other than a funeral.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/t-magazine/womens-fashion/24hberg.html

I began wearing them at the age of 21, when you could barely find a pair in a store, which doubtless was one reason no one wore them but me. The only ones for sale were made of felt, came in two separate bits and hooked over your upper ear and then snapped against your head. They were inadequate thermal protection compared to my current pair, which are made of fake fur; but they were far superior to being outdoors in winter without anything at all over your ears. I had serious fantasies that by wearing them, I would start something, fashion-wise, and now it seems I have.

The Soho club here offered a great space and amazing views and even a smoking cage, a place where the muse often hunts the Bagger down, but no one wants to put both pom poms in the air – not the night before, and maybe not the night after.

He got some company yesterday. The Bagger bumped into Tom Bernard, the co-chief honcho at Sony Pictures Classics, at the Spirit Awards. Bernard has a pretty good record in Oscar matters and has good sources among old members of the Academy, although he was wearing sunglasses that play MP3’s, so there is that. (Dog the Bounty Hunter, who is staying at the Bagger’s hotel, has a similar pair.) And Bernard said that Day-Lewis may not be the lock we have all said he was. “You’re probably right about Daniel Day-Lewis, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Clooney sneak in.”",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/crowded-high-wire/

2008-02-25,Calling an Audible,"This year’s Oscars would have seemed to be a great time to innovate, to put together a show on the fly that perhaps attacks some of the creakiness and convention that is part of Oscar gospel. Ain’t. Gonna. Happen. In spite of the fact that organizers had little more than a week to put together the show, this will be no ad-hoc Oscars. Look for the same glorious goo to be poured into the extant template. People who have seen the auditions say that there is a palpable desire for normalcy, for business as usual, but that means the same brutal copy will show up on the teleprompter and be beamed straight at you.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/calling-an-audible/
2008-02-25,Breaking the Rules,"When he learned I wanted to write a play, Jon Jory, who was then Artistic Director of Actors Theatre of Louisville, took me out to lunch and said, “OK, here are the three mistakes you don’t have to make.” And that’s pretty much the way I teach to this day — telling writers the traps they don’t have to fall into, not saying how it has to be done, just trying to save them some of their precious time. Over the years people have yelled at me for teaching the rules, or even for suggesting that there are rules. But I never expect these rules to be followed absolutely. They serve the same purpose as the boundary flags in ski resorts. You can ski in the ungroomed powder if you want, but you’d better know what you’re doing, and be willing to take the risk. Still, we do not turn on the television to watch average skiers take safe trips down the green trails. We turn on the X Games to see heli-skiers land on the top of glaciers and shoot off the edges of the cliffs, or watch the great Shaun White “shred some gnarly terrain”, as my son says. And that brings us to “August: Osage County,” a play that only seems traditional, but actually creates its excitement by breaking the rules.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/breaking-the-rules/

The first year … well, we let people vote more than once, so the results were just a tad skewed. But this year, the numbers look right, and in more ways than one. NYTimes.comers’ votes align nicely with the general zeitgeist (though not necessarily with the Bagger’s picks), though there are a few surprises. “No Country” gets picture, director, supporting actor and screenplay. But Daniel Day-Lewis is neck and neck with Johnny Depp for Best Actor. Cate Blanchett would win both actress awards if the readers were in charge.

2008-02-25,British Hegemony,"Every year, the Oscars pay a visit to that mid-Atlantic place where British and American culture mash up into something that combines Yankee rigor with English refinement. This year, that phenomenon shows up in the form of “Atonement,” with a young British director, Joe Wright, and ingénue Keira Knightley defining Anglophilian upper crust lust. And in the acting categories, you’ve also got your Tilda Swintons – who could win this year, btw – and Julie Christies, who is favored to win. Cate Blanchett is nominated, twice in fact, a sorta Brit from Australia. ",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/british-hegemony/

The package includes an audio file of the throw-down, but the overlords at the House of Many Doors edited out the part where Scott called the Bagger an “ignorant slut,” but it is still a lively and blessedly brief – the Bagger’s voice has been compared to the sound cows emit when they get a batch of bad feed – podcast about the worthiness of the national bonfire of glitter and gamesmanship.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/oscar-broadcast-a-lovehate-story/

Many consider Roitfeld the stilettoed embodiment of modern dressing: she describes her style as ‘‘tacky chic.’’ Never afraid to take a risk, she has put a bearded drag queen on a cover and printed a fashion story with a model dressed as an Anna Wintour clone.

(Jean-Luce Huré for The New York Times))   I had plans--plans I tell you!--to be up early and roaming the town but my pillow snatched me back and it was past noon before I set off to the Place de la Concorde, already crowded with people. It was a stunning day, cloudless and mild. The first show for most of the editors and buyers was Balmain (the tightest, smallest pants and club tops in leather and metal mesh, nothing surprising) and a number of the guests had brought their young children. In the course of the day I heard a lot of things. Will Robert Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano of 6267 take over Ferre? Is Hedi Slimane in negotiations for his own men's and women's label? Time will tell. I thought Slimane's pictures (in New York Magazine) of Carine Roitfeld were terrific, and evocative of her. And take a look at the spreads with Lara Stone in the current Paris Vogue, particularly Neo Classiques, by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.   (Photo: Another look from the Rick Owens fall 2008 collection in Paris. (Jean-Luce Huré for The New York Times))   Rick Owens was this afternoon: great show. The collection is more voluptuous than last season, with the familiar darkness and Owens grit. Owens gives a kind of hour-glass shape to jackets, sometimes using two or three fabrics in combination, and creating sculptural effects. The thought process seemed very top to toe, with small, square-ish caps, fins and cube-like volumes on some of the jackets, and wedge-heel boots with flaps that spill around the calf and drag on the ground. In the midst of all this shape and texture were simple tank dresses and skimmy biker shorts in cashmere. Thom Browne happened to be at the show.   The New York Times Magazine and the International Herald Tribune had a party tonight at the Mini Palais. I stopped by for a few minutes. Well, that was the plan... I saw Stefano Pilati, Sidney Toledano of Dior, Kris Van Assche, Maria Cornejo, and Manuel Puig, whose company owns Nina Ricci. Puig is an interesting guy to talk to--about business, U.S. politics, Europe, Formula 1 racing. On my way out, I ran into Karl Lagerfeld and Amanda Harlech. Lagerfeld told me his suit was a Jil Sander by Raf Simons. I jumped in Mr. Alloux's waiting taxi, thinking I'd better save my strength for the rest of the week.

The commission said: “To be sure, the pixelation of the female strippers’ naked breasts and buttocks does render the material less explicit and graphic than it would have been in the absence of pixilation. However, the material is still sufficiently graphic and explicit to support an indecency ruling.” Fox disagreed. The commission, acting against only those stations subjected to complaints, fined 13 stations and affiliates $7,000 each. Last week it fined ABC stations and affiliates a total of $1.2 million for showing a woman’s bare buttock during an episode of “N.Y.P.D. Blue” in 2003. ABC paid but will appeal.

2008-02-26,Tempelsman Sculptures Return to Italy,"After a long battle two rare sixth-century B.C. marble sculptures that once belonged to the New York businessman Maurice Tempelsman go on view Tuesday at Italy’s presidential palace. For nearly 30 years rumors circulated that tomb robbers had dug up the statues on a hillside in the ancient Greek settlement of Morgantina in Sicily. After amassing evidence that they were looted, Italian investigators began seeking a handover of the acroliths  statues usually made with wooden torsos but with stone heads and extremities  in the late 1980s. Mr. Tempelsman, a diamond importer perhaps best known for having been the companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, remained unswayed until the Italian government threatened to sue him, an official said Monday. “He hadn’t wanted to give them up because he’d paid for them; that’s what he told me,” said Mario Bondioli Osio, who formerly headed of an Italian commission that sought to recover the country’s lost cultural patrimony. Mr. Tempelsman, who was said to be traveling and unavailable for comment, bought the acroliths from the London dealer Robin Symes in 1980 for a reported $1 million. In 2002 Mr. Bondioli Osio, Mr. Tempelsman and the University of Virginia worked out a deal under which Mr. Tempelsman would give the university partial ownership of the statues for five years and then cede them entirely. On Jan. 1 the acroliths  their wooden bodies long ago lost, leaving two heads, three hands and three feet  became the property of the university, which promptly returned them to Italy. The statues, one of which is shown above, arrived in Rome on Friday along with nine classical antiquities from the private collection of the New York philanthropist Shelby White that were ceded to Italy in January under a separate pact. Italy says Ms. White’s artifacts were also looted from Italian soil.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/arts/26arts-TEMPELSMANSC_BRF.html

The organization expressed hope that its new policy would encourage museums to put some pieces on display, and said it expected only a few sales each year. Vanessa Trevelyan, convener of the association’s ethics committee and head of Norfolk Museum and Archaeology Service, said, “Although disposal of items is not without risk, it is preferable to transfer items to an alternative home where they will be treasured, rather than retain material that is not supporting a museum’s research, display or interpretation functions.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/arts/26arts-BRITISHMUSEU_BRF.html

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault was built into a frigid mountainside in Norway’s northernmost archipelago, deep in the Arctic. It had its ceremonial opening Tuesday morning in the frigid gloom of the Arctic winter. [UPDATE: Many readers wondered about whether it was too close to sea level. But, as I learned in my three Arctic trips, things up there are way more spread out than they appear. The tunnel entrance is 130 meters, or about 400 feet, above sea level.

After dominating the last generation of gaming with its PlayStation 2, the company has failed to maintain its leadership more recently with the PlayStation 3 amid new challenges from its rivals Microsoft and Nintendo. The company said that Kazuo Hirai, Mr. Harrison’s boss as chief executive of Sony’s overall game unit, would assume Mr. Harrison’s duties. Mr. Harrison raised eyebrows in the game industry last week when he criticized Sony’s failure to recognize the growth of casual, social gaming. Nintendo has embraced that trend while Sony has largely focused on complicated, sometimes violent fare directed at young men.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/arts/27arts-SONYGAMESMAN_BRF.html

I know I am a hit at BAM, but to be on Broadway stands not within the prospect of belief. Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence? Well, it just so happens that the Broadway production of Mark Twain’s new-old play, “Is He Dead?,” is closing on March 9, when it will have played 13 previews and 105 regular performances at the Lyceum theater. The show, an adaptation by David Ives of a recently discovered Twain manuscript, was generally well reviewed, and its star, Norbert Leo Butz, drew raves. But the stagehands’ strike, a traffic jam of plays  some of which received stellar reviews  and the traditionally bad winter months helped do it in. “If I thought I could stay open through May, I would, but financially it just doesn’t make sense,” Bob Boyett, the lead producer, said.And it also just so happens that “Macbeth,” like its title character, is duly poised to fill the vacancy.

Paul Alberto Navone, who was suspected of kidnapping babies during the “dirty war” from 1976 to 1983, was found with a gunshot to the head at a hotel in Asochinga, in Córdoba, according to a lawyer involved in the case. He was to testify next week as part of an investigation into the kidnapping of babies of political prisoners. While the police said that a gun found next to him suggested suicide, rights advocates suggested murder. “They are eliminating the military officers being investigated for the dictatorship’s crimes,” Estela de Carlotto, president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, said in a radio interview. Marina Barbagelata, a lawyer involved in prosecuting the Navone case, said on television that it was “highly probable that there were people that could have seen themselves threatened by what he would say.” During the dictatorship, about 500 babies were kidnapped from their parents, of whom 88 have been identified through the efforts of rights advocates, Agence France-Presse reported. On Dec. 10, Héctor Febres, a former coast guard officer, was found dead in his prison cell, poisoned by cyanide.

I think the most interesting thing about Thierry Mugler’s Angel Men Pure Coffee, a limited edition scent landing this April and hanging around for a scant four months or so, is that it feels critic-proof as well. It is jarringly direct, like the person blithely unflustered by your eye contact. It is, in its friendly self-assurance, impossible to approach with any kind of critical knife; irritatingly disarming, it is as effortlessly pleasing as it is exasperatingly obvious.

2008-02-29,The Relevance of Ralph,"Eight years ago, I traveled the country with Ralph Nader. He was sardonic and surprisingly funny. As we drove through post-industrial landscapes of depressing sameness, Mr. Nader kept up a constant monologue about the spiritual costs of box stores and fast food. I recall standing at an airport counter — it was Sioux Falls, or maybe Fargo — where the agent cheerfully informed Mr. Nader that he had been upgraded to first class; he protested vigorously and smoldered the entire flight home. After Mr. Nader was tossed out of the presidential debate site in Boston, he and I watched the next debate in front of the TV at the brownstone that was his Washington headquarters. I ate pizza as Mr. Nader paced the room trying out phantom debate lines and railing against the two “corporate supremacists” on stage, who, he pointed out, refused to mention the plight of the working poor, the tilt of the political system toward special interests, the human toll of free trade.Mr. Nader’s candidacy took a dark turn in the closing weeks of the 2000 campaign. Until then, he had been running primarily to get the 5 percent of the vote he needed to qualify the Green Party for matching funds. But then Mr. Nader’s consuming resentment — at the way leading Democrats pressured his friends to denounce him, at the way Al Gore refused to speak his name — seemed to possess him, and at some point he seemed to make it his mission to deny Mr. Gore the presidency, attacking his Democratic rival in swing states over the protests of his own aides. I’ve always thought that Mr. Gore probably could have avoided what came next simply by picking up the phone in those final weeks and making some small gesture of respect toward the man. But he didn’t, and Mr. Nader got his wish.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/the-relevance-of-ralph/

Pilati carries forward the simplified lines of the spring collection and now adds more sex appeal, more flare to the geometry. The collection has a lot of versaility, but your eye goes immediately to the straight shoulders of unlined, cutaway coats in Donegal tweeds and then to the succinct volumes at the hem.

2008-02-29,Latest Legal News for Two Pop Singers,"Amy Winehouse, above left, doesn’t have to worry about a hearing on drug-possession charges in Norway as long as her husband stays in a British jail. That was the essence of a court ruling on Thursday in Bergen, Norway, where the Grammy-winning Ms. Winehouse was scheduled to appear on Friday, Agence France-Presse reported. “One of the people involved in the case, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse’s husband, is currently in jail in Britain and can’t make the trip,” said Anne Vedvik of the Bergen court. “The hearing has therefore been postponed to an undetermined date.” Ms. Winehouse, 24, her husband and her hairdresser were arrested in Bergen in October and charged with possessing a quarter-ounce of marijuana. Ms. Winehouse was released after paying a $756 fine, which she later contested. Agreeing to a fine in Norway is equivalent to admitting the charges, which could make it difficult for Ms. Winehouse to obtain visas. Mr. Fielder-Civil has been in custody since November, awaiting trial on charges of assault and conspiracy to pervert the cause of justice. He is accused of trying to bribe a barman not to testify against him in an assault case. ... Boy George, above right, denied on Thursday that he imprisoned a 28-year-old Norwegian man at his London home last year, The Associated Press reported. Appearing in a London court under his real name, George O’Dowd, he pleaded not guilty to a charge of false imprisonment lodged by Audun Carlsen, who claimed that he was handcuffed to a wall after he went to Boy George’s apartment in April as a photo model.
