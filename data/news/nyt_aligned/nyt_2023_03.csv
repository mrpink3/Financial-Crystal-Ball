In Borzutzky’s poem, living poems emerge from the dead, too, and without these poems, “the dead are assassinated.” Beginning with the chilling abstractions of the dealers of death, “Poem #1022” moves from the distant to the intimate.

Sometimes recovery demands peering into the shadows cast by towering canonical figures. “It might mean finding that writer who is just being overlooked because of the canonicity of, say, Toni Morrison,” Rambsy says. Sometimes it’s even simpler than that. “We don’t have to go deep into archives to find undervalued Black authors,” says the poet and U.C.L.A. English professor Harryette Mullen. In a recent essay, I look to such undervalued authors and works as the impetus for shaping a new Black canon.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/t-magazine/black-books-plays-poems.html

Their goal was to amplify Black voices, critique their exclusion from art history and draw attention to the racism they experienced as children of Caribbean migrants in conservative Britain. Claudette Johnson, born in Manchester in 1959, and studying at Wolverhampton Polytechnic at the time, joined the Blk Art Group soon after its formation and began working and exhibiting alongside her fellow members Eddie Chambers, Keith Piper, Marlene Smith and Donald Rodney. “The Black arts community that I became a part of in the ’80s was invaluable. It gave me people to talk to about my work. It made me feel a part of a movement,” says Johnson. “There was definitely a belief that we were going to change things. That we were shaking things up.” But despite this fervent start, the spotlight soon faded and the group’s contribution to contemporary art became largely overshadowed by the provocations of the Young British Artists, the loose affiliation that included Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. “We just couldn’t fit in in the way the Y.B.A.s could,” Johnson says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/t-magazine/claudette-johnson.html

2023-03-10,Help! I Canceled My Rental Because of a Wildfire. My Contract Says No Refund. Is That Fair?,"I booked a house on Lake Tahoe through Vrbo for my family to attend a wedding in September 2021. About two weeks before the wedding, we saw on the news that the Caldor wildfire had impacted the region, causing evacuations and blocked roads and filling the air with heavy smoke. Our group included young children, those with asthma and the elderly, for whom this environment would be a serious health risk. I canceled with Vrbo, but they would not refund me, offering me a credit toward a future rental through Evolve, the property manager, valid for two years. Evolve has significantly fewer listings than Vrbo, and I’ve been unable to find a satisfactory substitute anywhere on the California, Oregon or Washington coasts, for a visit with my son in Dillon, Colo., or to see family near Boston. With the deadline approaching, I feel like I’m being forced into a vacation I don’t want to take in a place I don’t want to go, and I want a refund. Can you help?

Matilda comes into the world like any cute baby — only, as she tells us in her introductory song, where other children’s parents say things like “She’s an angel,” Matilda’s tell her she’s “a good case for population control.” She finds acceptance via a teacher, Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch), and pushes back against the tyranny of Trunchbull, her parents and any adult who tries to crush her spirit.

So conservative that, when Pope Francis recently said that homosexuality is a sin but not a crime, observers (correctly) took that for progress. The connection between Catholicism and conservatism runs deep. It goes back to at least the Counter-Reformation, when the church had to defend the religious status quo in Christian Europe against Protestants’ radical criticisms of its priests, its hierarchy and its doctrines. In its day, the Catholic Church opposed the Enlightenment. It rejected freedom of conscience.

At the time, it was occupied by a butcher and his family, who were operating a slaughterhouse in the enormous ramshackle mansion that could be traced to the 19th century.

Love is sweeter for its losses and also for its afterlife, the poem itself a heartbreaker for all who know or will know soon enough what it is like to once have been “young and desirous” and to be those things no more.

During the Muromachi period (1336-1573), those varied productions were codified into an elaborately contrived entertainment for military leaders, some of whom, like the 16th-century warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, also acted in Noh. Presented using minimal props on a stage comprising a roof, four pillars and a bridge way, the plays dramatize myths and tales from traditional Japanese literature with monologues, sparse bamboo flute melodies, periodic percussion and tonal chanting. Often, supernatural beings take human form.

The “steak” rendition, a disk that’s ready to sear and comes pre-seasoned, is an adequate mimic but could benefit from the addition of some fat. The protein content is around 15 grams per serving, the fiber around eight.

With that, he joins an increasingly established subgenre: the celebrity travel show. Netflix has “Down to Earth With Zac Efron.” TBS had Conan O’Brien’s “Conan Without Borders.” CNN had “Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy,” which was both a celebrity travel show and a celebrity food show — another thriving subgenre, with entries from Selena Gomez, Amy Schumer, Jon Favreau and Paris Hilton.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/magazine/travel-show-celebrities.html

Labyrinths and mazes have appeared across cultures and time, made by digging ruts into the soil, laying out rock or mosaic or enclosing paths within hedges, walls, bamboo, corn and mirrors. The first recorded labyrinth dates to the 19th century B.C., built by Egyptians near the ancient city Arsinoe to hold the sepulcher of kings and crocodiles. In the desert of Peru, the Nazca dug winding geoglyphs in the shape of birds, flora and monkeys; some of them were thought to be traversed by gods and spirits, by priests and pilgrims during ceremonies. Rock-lined labyrinths along the coasts of the Baltic Sea may have been created in the Bronze Age. Surviving lore suggests they were used in spring pagan dances and light exorcisms, trapping malevolent spirits in their confounding geometry. And of course, one of the most enduring myths of ancient Greece is that of the Minotaur lying in wait at the center of the maze.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/magazine/maze-tourism.html

It was a gesture of play as much as protest, striking above all for Williams’s decision not to burn the flags but to preserve their crisp, and oddly appetizing, ruination. Last year, around the same time that those works were displayed at Lyles & King gallery in New York, Williams, 32, scaled up their practice by installing a 13-by-8-foot structure of hardened earth called “Ruins of Empire” in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The sculpture referenced the bronze Statue of Freedom (designed by the sculptor Thomas Crawford and fabricated by enslaved laborers) perched atop the dome of the U.S. Capitol since 1863, while sinking it into the earth. Rather than destroying a cherished American symbol, Williams was once again staging its decomposition — now in a larger sense and in view of the public. “I hate to use the word ‘magic,’” Williams says. “It’s like a mystery.

They are so often hidden away in notebooks and only years later, if ever, realized as poetry as such. I suspect if we could, by some miracle, find all the short poems waiting in notebooks or scribbled on envelope backs and string them together, humans would finally have, to the absurdity and beauty of this world, an adequate response. Until we have it all, I am grateful that at least we have Cedar Sigo’s “The Life of Sun Ra.” It creates, in its few lines, tremendous effect. Sigo finds in the jazz maestro Sun Ra a transcendent kinship. To be a stranger to this world is no bad thing when Jupiter awaits the homecoming of its blessed weirdos. The practice is the art.

In his first nine years as Pope (he was elected in 2013), Francis made 37 trips from the Vatican, and visited almost 60 countries. “In Viaggio: The Travels of Pope Francis,” assembled from footage shot over those years, never betrays a jet-lagged pontiff.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/movies/in-viaggio-the-travels-of-pope-francis-review.html

Born in 1957, Ai grew up during the Cultural Revolution in China, a time when the government, as he puts it, went to great lengths to erase evidence of the past that might contradict its rule. Now based in Portugal, the artist says that ruins are slices of history that are essential to human development. “Every ‘advance’ is built on failures,” he explains. “It’s only through these fragments that we have the possibility of redefining history.” As its title suggests, the show will encourage people to make sense of these objects, which are strewn across the Design Museum’s floor alongside Stone Age tools and Lego bricks that Ai has collected over the years. While viewers explore the exhibition, Ai wants them to question what they value and why. Sculptures of toilet rolls — mundane objects that became almost sacred during the pandemic — cast in marble and glass should bring home the point. “Ai Weiwei: Making Sense” is on view from April 7 to July 30, designmuseum.org.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/t-magazine/chateaumoabit-berlin-natural-wines.html

The timing seemed especially ill-fated, given that the United States Sentencing Commission that year was again calling attention to the racial disparities produced by what was known as the 100-to-1 rule. This meant that the same sentence would be applied to a dealer holding 50 grams of crack as the one selling 100 times that amount in cocaine, enough to fill a briefcase, privileging the high roller who sold powder to bond traders getting high in the bathroom at Raoul’s and crushing the corner hustler who funneled its cheaper derivative to the poor.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/nyregion/mass-incarceration-ny.html
