2021-01-05,Remembering the Stately Dinners of a Private Club,"Since 1872, New York’s Lotos Club, a literature and arts organization founded in 1870 that occupies a townhouse on East 66th Street, has regularly held banquets to honor notables in the arts, government, science, entertainment, sports and the business world. Well-known people tried pulling strings to be the featured guest. The dinners also include elaborate menus, sometimes featuring the art of the honoree. It’s all documented in “Art at the Table,” a lavish new book that describes around 120 of the 439 dinners that have been held through 2019. In the first 50 or so years, oysters, green turtle soup, fillet of beef and an ice cream dessert dominated the menus. Back in 1874, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the celebrity guest, but no women were honored until 1922, when the opera singer Mary Garden was selected. (Women could not join the club until 1977.) The authors have threaded anecdotes throughout, like Mark Twain’s nap during his 12-course meal, a special Peruvian menu served for Mario Vargas Llosa and the menu printed on a Beethoven score for Richard Arnold, a violinist. The name of the club was taken from “The Lotos-Eaters” by Alfred Tennyson.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/dining/lotos-club-book.html

Corey Hammond, who works in e-commerce and consulting, moved to Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, four years ago and missed having a convenient butcher. Then, as restaurants like Faun, Oxalis and Olmsted began opening in the neighborhood, he thought a local butcher might be welcome. He connected with Greg Brockman, who left Forager’s Market in Dumbo. In May, they opened a weekend pop-up butcher in the kitchen of Faun, and its success justified their idea. Now, they have opened their own butcher selling nose-to-tail meats from a number of local farms, 32 to 230 miles away as listed on their website. “We couldn’t have gotten started without the pandemic,” Mr. Hammond said. “The restaurant kitchen wouldn’t have been available for our pop-up.” The shop is worker-owned. “I wanted the people who helped to build this business to get something out of it,” Mr. Brockman said. “The food business is really difficult, and this way we can pay a decent wage and know the workers would be more dedicated.” There are three other people involved in the shop. In addition to a variety of cuts of meat and poultry, the shop will offer rotisserie chickens, charcuterie, condiments and seasonings, and sandwiches.

Each draws us into its own world of materials and techniques, forms and meanings, creating a kind of isolation, or spell that distances it from whatever is around it.

2021-01-12,How to Soundproof a Room,"“Stack rugs or wrestling mats on the floor,” says Yoron Israel, who leads the percussion department at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Sound doesn’t want to be contained; it undulates easily through air, concrete, brick and wood. In fact, it moves faster through solids, with their more densely packed molecules. An acoustic drum set is a high-decibel instrument with low frequencies particularly suited to spreading. Adjust your expectations: You can’t truly soundproof a room without decoupling it from the larger structure, which means building a new room within your existing room, preferably with several inches of air space and acoustic insulation between the two. Such a project will cost thousands of dollars, and if you’re a renter, landlords aren’t likely to sign off. You can buy pricey, prefabricated sound-insulation rooms, but Israel often advises his percussion students to go the cheaper, sound-dampening route. To do that you’ll want to hang drapery, acoustic-foam tiles or even mattress toppers over walls, ceilings, floors and doors. If you’re a drummer and can get away with it, leave your windows uncovered. “You deserve light,” Israel says. “People always make drummers play in basements.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/magazine/how-to-soundproof-a-room.html

His partners are Rafiq Salim and Paul Wetzel, previously sous-chefs at Gramercy, and Ben Howell, who was a bar manager there and is overseeing front of the house. The pastry chef is Kelly Mencin, who is not a partner but was also at Gramercy Tavern. It took these colleagues more than five years to come back together for this project. The space is divided into a front room, meant to be the bar with banquettes and some high-top tables, and a partly skylit dining room that can seat about 100 people and has an open kitchen fitted with a wood-burning oven and grill.  For now, the bar is a counter where baked goods, homemade pastas, dips, sauces and ice cream are sold to take away, along with grocery items, wines, liquors and cocktails that use locally made spirits. The chefs have come up with a dinner package, $17 per person, for takeout and delivery that consists of a main dish like grilled porchetta with sides, including fried rice and cauliflower salad. Wood-fired half chickens, grilled greens, braised butter beans with salsa verde and focaccias with substantial toppings are among the other menu options. Housemade charcuterie is on the horizon. Stephen Maharam, a regular Gramercy Tavern customer, is another partner, running the business side, and Kermit Westergaard, the architect and contractor, is also a partner by virtue of owning the building. His dog, Rolo, inspired the name. “Everyone in the neighborhood knows Rolo,” Mr. Kalachnikoff said. “We hope they’ll remember us, too.” (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

2021-01-19,A Chef’s Book Shows the Culinary Joys of Travel,"“The Relation Between Us,” the latest book from the Danish chef Bo Bech, is a page-turner. With 368 pages of his photographs, mostly of food scenes from around the world, interspersed with compelling text, the book is hard to put down (and hard to lift up). He says it covers 15 years of travel and eating. The tone of his writing (in translation) is chatty yet serious, threaded here and there with wonderment at some of his encounters, like the man in New Delhi who told Mr. Bech he was eating at the wrong places and offered restaurant recommendations one day at a time. Reading what Mr. Bech has to say might make you a more confident cook. He gives advice like this: “Remember, you can always add things. It’s harder to remove things.” He’s particularly attached to his chopping board and his blender and to Espelette pepper. Most of the nearly 40 recipes, in blocks of text, are simple and tempting, but often unusual — and one of the reasons I couldn’t stop reading — like one for corn in a pan, with butter and egg. There’s a dressing for shellfish made with onions and mezcal, a four-ingredient barbecue sauce, and risotto rice that’s baked and rested.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/dining/bo-bech-book-the-relation-between-us.html

The latest is Mashama Bailey, the chef who owns The Grey in Savannah, Ga., with her business partner, Johno Morisano. (The Grey opened in 2014, and is named for its location in a former Greyhound bus terminal.) Chefs from restaurants in Paris, Mumbai, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, have been in residence with Intersect’s chef, Nickolas Martinez, and Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, to run its kitchen. But the recent cancellation of indoor dining has finally turned the Intersect’s informal luxury toward takeout and delivery only. The Grey’s three-course menus with sides, $65 per person, plus tax, gratuity and delivery, are posted weekly on Mondays, and available Thursdays through Sundays. Its residency will continue through mid-April. At the Grey, Ms. Bailey, a Bronx native who moved with her family to Savannah in 1980, then back to New York before returning to Savannah, stitches together a personal take on Southern and soul food. This week’s nicely packaged menu features smoked catfish with rye crackers, yardbird chicken with captain sauce, and devil’s food cake. Leeks vinaigrette, red snapper and butterscotch cream will be served next week, and, the week after, there will be crab Louis, smoked lamb and a brown-butter fritter. Southern-style cocktails will also be sold. Intersect, which has a program of culinary training for formerly incarcerated youth, is donating 500 meals to health care workers.

2021-01-20,What It Means to Look at Paintings of Snow,"Last winter, on a day that would reach 66 degrees by noon, I saw, on the wall of the Whitney Museum, a painting of snow. Not just snow: “The Trapper” (1921) by Rockwell Kent also depicts a lone man; a dog; mountains, clouds, and sky; a pale half-moon. But it was the snow, along with the blue shadows graphed over it, that gripped me. In the dimly lit room (its dimness exacerbated by the over-bright sun outside) the whole painting seemed to glow. I couldn’t stop looking. The winter of 2019 would prove to be one of the warmest on record, during which only 4.8 inches of snow would fall. Stumbling on Kent’s painting felt like unearthing a picture of a lost loved one: the recognition, the elation, the grief. Yet I only wanted more. My daughter had asked that morning if it would ever snow again. I knew it would, but I also knew that, here and elsewhere, it will snow less. In northern Europe snow festivals had been canceled. In Hokkaido, Japan, snow had been imported by truck. Always traced with ephemerality — the snow likely melted before the rendering was done — paintings of snow now record a double evanescence.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/t-magazine/paintings-snow-winter-art.html

In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results of a nationwide survey conducted during the last week in June: More than 40 percent of those who responded reported symptoms of anxiety or depression or increased substance use, in addition to other struggles. And more than 10 percent said that they had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days, compared with just over 4 percent who said the same thing in 2018 — and who were referring to suicidal ideation over the previous 12 months. “We want to know, who is most at risk from suicide in the pandemic,” says Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the survey. And yet, he adds, “we won’t know until it’s mostly over.” That’s because it can take a year or two for the C.D.C. to collect and analyze national mortality data.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/magazine/will-the-pandemic-result-in-more-suicides.html

But simpler recipes — like carrot potage, roast eggplant rice, and bamboo shoot and mountain vegetable sukiyaki, which require little background in Japanese ingredients beyond dashi, soy sauce and miso — are relatively few.

I knew that a droguerie was where I could get straw market baskets (although I originally thought it was where I’d find aspirin); that a quincaillerie (a word I eventually learned to pronounce) was the place for screwdrivers and a staggering assortment of spot removers; and that Monoprix was where I could buy everything from saucepans and fresh fruit to that bright yellow raincoat that I still wear. As I settled in, French friends helped me open a bank account, taught me the etiquette of cheese (the most important rule: never cut the nose off the Brie) and shared the names of their favorite butchers, fishmongers and wine shops.

2021-01-28,"A Famous Prada Print, Back With a Twist","Cartoon bananas, Surrealist lips, apocalyptic Hawaiian florals, kitschy tail fins with flames — Miuccia Prada is known for her eccentric prints and patterns. Another iconic motif arrived 25 years ago with Prada’s spring 1996 collection, arguably one of the designer’s most influential. Dubbed Banal Eccentricity — the show notes cited a 1980 exhibition at the Venice Biennale featuring mass-produced ordinary household objects — it hewed to a palette of avocado greens, rusty ochers and eggplant purples, which featured on solid-colored minimalist pieces and those with squiggly, hand-scribbled plaids that took cues from midcentury wallpaper and kitchen design. Another print — which was composed of overlapping abstract squares inspired by 1950s Formica-tiled countertops and appeared on gabardine midlength overcoats and pencil skirts — became synonymous with the concept of ugly chic. If that now seems like an overused descriptor, revisiting the collection is a reminder of the brand’s ever-prescient vision. Ushered onto the runway by a waifish brigade that included Kate Moss and a pixie-haired Carolyn Murphy, it stood in stark contrast to the slick sexiness of Armani and Tom Ford’s Gucci — and it subverted traditional notions of good taste, and even earned comparisons to Dior’s New Look. “If I have done anything, it was making ugly cool,” Mrs. Prada herself once said. “Ugly is attractive, ugly is exciting.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/t-magazine/prada-print-formica.html
