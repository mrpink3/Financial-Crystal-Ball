Corrections officials had denied the surgery, saying that it could create security problems. In his decision, Judge Mark L. Wolf found that the denial of the surgery, which would be financed with state taxes, amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. He is believed to be the first federal judge to order gender reassignment. Mr. Kosilek is serving a life sentence without parole. He sued the Department of Corrections over the matter in 2000.

Tests are being performed to determine whether the oil belongs to the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon, and results are expected within days. “It possibly could be our oil, but we don’t know,” said Ray Melick, a spokesman for BP, adding that crews were engaged in cleanup activities in the area only days before the storm.

Ubuntu, which makes a free and easy-to-use version of Linux, has traditionally made it easy to try out the system by posting instructions for making a compact disc that can boot up and run Linux for a test drive before installing it. But for old computers with broken disc drives, Ubuntu Linux can also be run from a USB flash drive. The Ubuntu site has detailed instructions here for making a bootable USB stick (or CD) with the current version of Ubuntu from either a Windows or Mac computer, and an online demo here.

2012-09-06,The Clinton Magic,"In a sweeping, sprawling, drawling 48-minute stemwinder of a speech last night, the former President of the United States drove a rhetorical truck through the biggest opening that Mitt Romney and the Republicans created for Democrats last week. The G.O.P. convention promised to make difficult choices and hard calls and be bracingly honest with the public, but the Republican speakers discussed policy in only the broadest and loosest terms, eschewing detail in favor of generalizations and creativity in favor of boilerplate. In response, Bill Clinton did everything they didn’t, diving deep on policy detail, covering issues ranging from Medicaid to welfare to prescription drugs to student loans, and effectively defining the Republicans — defining them negatively, it need hardly be said — on a range of issues where they declined to define themselves. Writing on Paul Ryan last week, I said that we shouldn’t be surprised that his speech was less wonky than his reputation, since a VP address is “hardly the time to talk about block grants and premium support and whether to peg spending rates to inflation or G.D.P. plus one percent.” But Clinton reminded us that this need not be true — that it’s possible to get wonky without losing your audience, and to embrace policy detail as a weapon against your opponents. Journalists tend to assume that voters tune policy substance out, and when the substance is delivered droningly or too abstractly no doubt they often do. But for the most effective rhetoricians, the mere act of talking in detail about the work of government can be a more effective way to persuade the public that you’re serious than a hundred vague promises to “make the hard choices” and “level with the American people.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/the-clinton-magic/

2012-09-07,Lost Tracks,"“Telegraph Avenue,” Michael Chabon’s rich, comic new novel, is a homage to an actual place: the boulevard in Northern California where Oakland — historically an African-American city — aligns with Berkeley, whose bourgeois white inhabitants are, as one character puts it, “liable to invest all their hope of heaven in the taste of an egg laid in the backyard by a heritage-breed chicken.” The novel is equally a tribute to the cinematic style of Quentin Tarantino, whose films its characters study and discuss, and whose preoccupations pepper its pages: kung fu, cinematic allusions and the blaxploitation films of the 1970s; and an interest in African-American characters and experience. Chabon and Tarantino make an unlikely duo; while the latter’s films tend toward gaudy eruptions of violence, Chabon bends Tarantino’s sensibility to a warmhearted novel about fatherhood in which the onstage violence consists of two graphic childbirth scenes and a 15-year-old boy whacking a chubby thug with a wooden sword.

2012-09-07,The President Plays It Safe,"The strongest impression left by Mitt Romney’s convention speech last week was that the Republican nominee’s campaign sees itself on pace for a narrow victory in November, with no risks or course corrections needed. The impression left by President Obama’s convention speech tonight was that incumbent’s campaign feels exactly the same way. This was a pure stay-the-course speech, workmanlike and occasionally somewhat distant, with a few inspired and moving passages standing out amid a litany of rhetorical moves that the president has made many times before. There was only the most general sketch of a second term agenda, only a relatively cursory defense of the president’s economic stewardship, and mostly assertions, rather than sustained arguments, to back up his claim that the country is headed (slowly) in the right direction. The strongest and most detailed portions of his remarks came on foreign policy (where his record is more popular and easier to defend) and in his late-in-the-speech attacks on the Republican ticket, which did effectively exploit some of the vulnerabilities that Romney’s rather content-free address created. And yes, maybe if Bill Clinton hadn’t covered so much of that territory so effectively last night, these strengths would have been enough to make the speech feel successful as a whole. But in the shadow of Clinton’s performance, the president often felt flat, rote, and unconvincing — almost as though he wasn’t quite convinced by his own arguments and promises, and felt a little awkward selling them to us.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/the-president-plays-it-safe/

In “A Bachelor’s Complaint,” in 1823, Charles Lamb deplored the exhibitionism of married couples who “perk up” their public displays of affection when in the company of single friends. In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis lamented that American law, which protects privacy indirectly through laws safeguarding property, contains no remedies for the mental suffering that results from an offense against honor. Rather than attempting a comprehensive treatment of the subject, the privacy essayist identifies a distinctive value that privacy protects (ranging from dignity and autonomy to intimacy and friendship) and defends its value by using concrete examples and anecdotes from daily life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/books/review/privacy-by-garret-keizer.html

We believe that any nationality, no matter how small, has the inherent right to its own nationhood.” That was the core of the Atlantic Charter in 1941, which both Churchill and Roosevelt signed.

It tells a story of political foibles, overly ambitious goals and feckless Afghans and Americans. The United States seems condemned to lurch between disastrous quick fixes and unrealistic visions of remaking countries overnight in its own image, never finding a middle road. No doubt most readers of this book will come away with the conclusion that our principal enemy in all this is ourselves.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/books/review/little-america-by-rajiv-chandrasekaran.html
2012-09-07,Many Wars in One,"Toward the end of this powerful narrative of World War II, Antony Beevor quotes a report, by the Australian war correspondent Godfrey Blunden, of an encounter with some American troops who had just been released from German P.O.W. camps. They had been in Europe only a few months, thrown into combat and almost instantly captured during the Ardennes offensive, Hitler’s last big throw of the dice. The men now had “xylophone ribs” and “gangling arms.” Some of their fellow prisoners had been beaten to death by their guards for attempting to take sugar beets from fields. Blunden wrote: “They were more pitiful because they were only boys drafted from nice homes in a nice country knowing nothing about Europe, not tough like Australians, or shrewd like the French or irreducibly stubborn like the English. They just didn’t know what it was all about.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/books/review/the-second-world-war-by-antony-beevor.html

(When I was growing up there in the 1980s, my father used to point him out to me as we did the grocery shopping in Park Slope — this was a rare kind of sighting.) Back in those days, his novels — the New York Trilogy, “Leviathan,” “Moon Palace” — seemed postmodern and fresh. They mingled the tropes of detective fiction with a kind of European quasi-philosophical ambiguity. “Kafka goes gumshoe,” as one of his editors described it. The novels comprised stories nested within stories; there were characters named Paul Auster, and there were doppelgängers even for the ­doppelgängers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/books/review/winter-journal-by-paul-auster.html
2012-09-07,Murder in the Cathedral,"“The biographer’s trap,” John Guy remarks in “Thomas Becket,” his portrait of that foremost friend turned foremost foe of Henry II, “is to look for a decisive moment of change.” But, he adds, “to do that is to write the history of the saint without his shadow.” With ­Becket, this temptation often seems to have been irresistible, from the very night of his murder, Dec. 29, 1170, near the high altar of Canterbury Cathedral. As a crowd swooped down on the battered corpse of the archbishop, tearing off pieces of clothing to dip in the gruesome puddle of his blood and brains, the outlines of the story of Becket’s sudden conversion from ­luxury-loving chancellor to ascetic defender of the church were already being rehearsed, soon to be followed by tales of his miraculous powers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/books/review/thomas-becket-by-john-guy.html

An oversize parka in waterproof nylon? Make like the director Michael Haneke and toss it over your red-carpet suit. If it all sounds a bit mad, consider it thus: in reversing the normal codes of dressing well (evening coat with evening look, casual jacket with casual wear), designers are trying to make fashion more responsive to the way men actually aspire to dress, i.e. to look on-trend but with offhand elegance.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/t-magazine/editors-letter.html

2012-09-10,Backstage Beauty Report | Alexander Wang,"The Look: Modern MinimalismThe Makeup: The makeup artist Diane Kendal opted for a clean, matte complexion to complement the minimalist nature of Alexander Wang’s Spring 2013 collection. Skin was first primed with NarsSkin Optimal Brightening Concentrate, then coated with the brand’s Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30/PA+++. Next, using a contoured blush brush (in place of the classic, dome-shaped powder brush), Kendal applied two shades of Nars Sheer Glow Powder Foundation — a lighter one on the outside of the face and a darker one across the cheeks — to perfect. (At press time, Kendal was not at liberty to disclose why, but a selection of models were given a more futuristic finish using Nars Light Reflecting Loose Setting Powder and Albatross Highlighting Blush on the high points of their cheeks, with some also sporting bleached or whited-out brows.) Eyes were contoured using Cayenne eyeshadow, while the same product in Blondie (light) or Bali (dark) were used to fill in the brows. Lashes were left bare.The Hair: “Ponytails are always very prevalent in New York,” says the stylist Guido Palau. “Half my career has been based on trying to reinvent it.” For Wang’s presentation, Palau used a variation on a look he’d originally conceived in the early ’90s: the taped center-part. To modernize the look, the stylist opted for dual texture — a sleek top with movement in the back — and low positioning. To achieve this, the top of the head (to behind the ears) was first dampened, then parted and treated with Redken Satinwear 02 Ultimate Blow-Dry Lotion before being blown straight.

2012-09-10,A Slow Weekend at the Box Office,"The fall movie season got under way, just barely, with what may turn out to be one of the least-attended weekends at cinemas in years. The only new release of note was “The Words” (CBS Films), a poorly reviewed drama about a plagiarizing novelist.

The No. 1 movie was a holdover: “The Possession” (Lionsgate) took in an estimated $9.5 million, for a two-week total of about $33.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. The Weinstein Company’s “Lawless” was second, selling about $6 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $23.5 million. In its fourth weekend “The Expendables 2” (Lionsgate) placed fourth, grossing about $4.8 million and lifting its total to $75.4 million. “The Bourne Legacy” (Universal Pictures) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4 million, for a five-week total of $103.7 million. Deadline.com summed up the weak box-office results this way: “The weekend of Sept. 5, 2008, was the last time no films grossed over $10 million.

Eagerly-awaited movies like Ben Affleck’s “Argo” (which earned good word-of-mouth at a sneak preview at the Telluride Film Festival last month) delivered, earning a standing ovation at its packed premiere on Friday. Reviews called the film, about the Iranian hostage crisis in the 1970s, Mr. Affleck’s coming-of-age moment as an actor-director. At the after-party last week, Mr. Affleck was jovial, ordering pizza and chatting with friends like Matt Damon, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt late into the night. He talked eagerly about shooting at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., but admitted to some worry that the geo-political theme would make the film “challenging” to market. “I’m working harder to promote this movie,” he said. “I can furnish you with endless” material. (We will expect it.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/toronto-film-festival-partying-with-ben-affleck-and-reactions-to-the-master-cloud-atlas-and-more/

In due time, hundreds, then thousands, will serve up a cuisine that is not Mexican, or Caribbean, or Latin American, but one faithful to Spain. Not only will they staff a national roster of credibly Spanish restaurants, but they will go on to create new ones. Ultimately, that will ramp up American demand for the wine and products of Spain.

Ms. Graylock takes portraits of celebrities and prints them on the seats of chairs, you see.

2012-09-11,Stone Links: Answerable Questions,"At The Guardian, a lengthy exchange between Julian Baggini and Lawrence Krauss on how philosophy relates to science. Krauss, a physicist, takes the view that all answerable questions are empirical; any philosophical question that turns out to be answerable, then, is in fact a disguised (frequently nascent) scientific one. Baggini contends that ethical questions are the great counterexample to Krauss’s reductive view. They cannot be settled by any simple appeal to empirical facts (concerning biology or evolutionary psychology, say); yet we do not consider them unanswerable or fit merely for idle philosophical debate. (One also wonders what Krauss would say about mathematical knowledge, which is, on most views, nonempirical.) Krauss, however, digs his heels in, arguing that ethical questions can indeed be settled empirically: “Ultimately, I think our understanding of neurobiology and evolutionary biology and psychology will reduce our understanding of morality to some well-defined biological constructs.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/stone-links-answerable-questions/

Marchers waved yellow-and-red-striped Catalan flags, below, and carried signs demanding independence from Spain. The police estimated the crowd at 1.5 million people. In response to Spain’s financial crisis, the Spanish government is forcing regions like Catalonia to enact drastic budget cuts. Catalonia, which accounts for 19 percent of Spain’s gross domestic product, has long demanded greater fiscal autonomy from Madrid and a lower contribution to a system that redistributes tax revenue to poorer regions. Catalonia also has the largest debt among Spanish regions, which has forced its government to make some of the deepest budget cuts in Spain.

It was unclear whether charges might be brought against Mr. de Villepin, who was released after several hours of questioning, a police spokesman said. Investigators believe that Mr. Bulot, the former president of Relais et Châteaux, a luxury hotel and restaurant network, embezzled more than $2 billion from the company. In a recorded telephone conversation from 2010, Mr. de Villepin, who was no longer in government, appears to tell Mr. Bulot that he pressured managers at the company to keep the fraud a secret, according to French news media reports. Mr. Bulot’s lawyer told the newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur that his client had embezzled about $640,000, but that Mr. de Villepin had been unaware of it.

It’s also the company’s strenuous commitment to do-gooding — a comfort to travelers who might otherwise be reluctant to visit very poor countries rivened by past conflicts. Volcanoes’ newest outpost, Kyambura Gorge (above), sits on a once-derelict coffee plantation near Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park. The eight-room eco-lodge supports a collective of coffee farmers and has cleverly used detritus from local villages in its design. Human-animal conflict is a very real problem in these parts; elephants can destroy a family’s subsistence crops in minutes. So Volcanoes has helped villagers learn beekeeping — elephants are terrified of bees — which allows them to protect crops and establish a sweet new revenue stream: honey.

Past outings include record-release parties, lessons on flea-market haggling and pop-up film screenings at Yaam, a Jamaican beach club on the Spree.

The 1972 earthquake shattered Managua’s once glorious boulevards, and today building styles vary wildly, from the squat residential buildings that popped up after the tremors, to older, more majestic neo-Classical and modern edifices. But despite an initial impression of chaos, you will find smooth roads and a full range of hotels and restaurants serving hearty local fare. The years of political upheaval marked by the 1979 revolution and then the brutal civil war of the 1980s have finally given way to stability. Yet travelers on their way to the coasts or quaint colonial towns still rush away from the capital upon arrival. That’s too bad.

To replicate the program in New York City, to cover the college tuition of all 52,000 students who graduate from the nation’s largest school system every year, an endowment of something like $20 billion would be needed, according to Keith Luke, at the Connecticut-based Commonfund, which manages $25 billion in assets for nonprofit institutions. “Such an endowment,” he says, “would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education.” Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal.

The Met often collaborates with major institutions like Juilliard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art but rarely with such a small fish. “It seemed like a good idea, as a way of educating the audience and reaching out to a new audience, to have performances down there,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said. Mr. Gelb said the first performance, on Oct. 26, would involve a few cast members of “The Tempest” and Mr. Adès as pianist performing scaled-down numbers from the opera. The concert will include works by Ives, Purcell, Stravinsky and Tippett, with other instrumentalists joining in, a spokesman later added. Mr. Muhly will play and program the second concert in May.

The revolution feminists have been waiting for, she says, is happening now, before our very eyes. Men are losing their grip, patriarchy is crumbling and we are reaching “the end of 200,000 years of human history and the beginning of a new era” in which women — and womanly skills and traits — are on the rise. Women around the world, she reports, are increasingly dominant in work, education, households; even in love and marriage. The stubborn fact that in most countries women remain underrepresented in the higher precincts of power and still don’t get equal pay for equal work seems to her a quaint holdover, “the last artifacts of a vanishing age rather than a permanent configuration.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/the-end-of-men-by-hanna-rosin.html

Heffernan was a graduate student in computer science, and by this point — the summer of 1997 — he had been working for two years with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University on developing computer software to help students improve their skills. But he had come to believe that the programs did little to assist their users. They were built on elaborate theories of the student mind — attempts to simulate the learning brain. Then it dawned on him: what was missing from the programs was the interventions teachers made to promote and accelerate learning. Why not model a computer program on a human tutor like Lindquist?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/magazine/how-computerized-tutors-are-learning-to-teach-humans.html

2012-09-14,Who Made That Marshmallow?,"A century ago, confectioners made marshmallows from a froth of sugar, starch and gelatin, in a laborious process that involved lots of primping. Each candy had to “sweat” for several hours to form its delicate skin, and then it was sprinkled with starch. In the 1950s, Alex Doumak — an executive at the Doumak candy company — dreamed up an efficient solution to the problem of the slow marshmallow: he treated the candy goo as an industrial material. Machines forced the marshmallow slurry through tubes, subjected it to blasts of gas at 200 pounds per square inch, extruded it into long tails and then cut it into bite-size chunks. Doumak filled the candy with air, like a tire, trapping nothingness in an architecture of sugar. “Extrusion allowed for the marshmallow we’re used to today — with that springy, fluffy texture,” Sue Watson, manager of the company archives at Kraft Foods, says. Kraft began extruding its own marshmallows in the late 1950s, but its most creative touch might have been the space-age name it gave to the factory process — jet-puffed — as if the marshmallows had exploded out of a rocket-ship engine. As part of a 1959 promotion, children sent in empty Kraft marshmallow bags for a chance to own a 29-foot spaceship equipped with astronaut suits, countdown lights and an “astro projector for space observation.” The modern marshmallow may be mostly air, but it’s a sweet lesson in less is more.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/magazine/who-made-that-marshmallow.html

But after reading William Souder’s engrossing new biography of Carson, “On a Farther Shore,” I returned to the book and discovered its central message to be — depressingly — timeless. Substitute organic pesticides and herbicides with the endocrine-­disrupting compounds found in everyday household items or the creep of chemicals used in hydrof­racking, and you may experience the same hair-prickling alarm felt by Carson’s readers 50 years ago.

2012-09-14,Vile Bodies,"“The Thing About Thugs” is an odd confection of a novel, set mostly in what looks like late-Victorian London. The streets are gaslit. The underworld teems with the flotsam of empire: lascars, Irishmen and so on, the undesirables of many nations. The city is overwhelmed with crime and prostitution and an influx of immigrants. Opium dens abound. And a serial killer is on the loose. Known as the “head cannibal,” he decapitates his victims after murdering them, but the heads are never found. The Metropolitan Police are baffled, as they were by Jack the Ripper, active in 1888, who also desecrated the bodies of his victims. Meanwhile, characters with names like One-Eyed Jack make shady deals in low taverns, and at the dinner tables of the upper classes Darwinian ideas are hotly debated. It feels as if we’re in the disillusioned twilight of the 19th century, but our narrator — or one of our narrators — sitting in his grandfather’s library “surrounded by Dickens and Collins,” claims that his story is set in 1837, the year Victoria ascended to the throne.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/the-thing-about-thugs-by-tabish-khair.html

In a neat twist on Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” Thomas Kilbride, who has been crazy about maps since he was 6 years old, is obsessively poring over Whirl360, a computer program rather like Google Street View, when he fixates on the image of someone being suffocated while standing at a window in an apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Rather, as she explains in “Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History,” her mammary glands are no different from those of most American women. In the year 2012, breast-feeding still passes many good things from mother to baby: vitamins, minerals and “a solid hedge of extras to help ward off a lifetime of diseases.” But the practice also typically transfers “paint thinners, dry-cleaning fluids, wood preservatives, toilet deodorizers, cosmetic additives, gasoline by-products, rocket fuel, termite poisons, fungicides” and varieties of flame retardants, one of which, Penta-BDE, was banned by the European Union because of its chronic toxicity to humans.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/breasts-by-florence-williams.html

In her first novel, “The Great Stink,” a thriller that takes place in the sewers of Victorian London, Clark wrote with such rich detail that you could almost smell the fetid air as you turned the pages. In “Savage Lands,” she transported readers to the young colony of Louisiana in the early 1700s, setting a complex love story against a fecund yet relentlessly cruel landscape that became as important to the plot as the characters themselves.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/beautiful-lies-by-clare-clark.html

Among them are writers for young people who, in addition to creating great stories, engage an audience with little knowledge or interest in Victoriana. Two who rise to the challenge this fall are the debut author Stefan Bachmann, a teenager who is studying music at the Zurich Conservatory, and the Newbery Award winner (for “Good Masters!

A former member of the Navy SEALs, Bissonnette is the author of “No Easy Day,” which enters the list at No. 1 and describes, among other things, his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The book (written with Kevin Maurer) has received admiring reviews — in the daily New York Times, Janet Maslin called it “an exciting, suspenseful account” — but it has also stirred anger among special operations forces, who adhere proudly to a code of silence. Breaking it means Bissonnette is unlikely to be included in future SEAL reunions, one retired Navy officer told The Washington Times: “The guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back.” But Bissonnette hasn’t let the critics keep him down. He sat for a recent “60 Minutes” interview (heavily disguised, inset) and told Scott Pelley the first thing he did upon returning from the mission was visit a Taco Bell drive-through.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/books/review/inside-the-list.html

It chronicles the fate of three men with the same first name: Adolf Kamil, a Jewish boy; Adolf Kaufmann, the young boy with a German father and a Japanese mother who befriends him; and Adolf Hitler. The boys become entangled in a struggle between opposing sides — one that wants to expose Hitler’s Jewish ancestry and another that wants to suppress it at all costs.

2012-09-19,Timely | Melody Maker,"The first thing you notice about Rae Morris is her voice, something the 20-year-old singer from Blackpool, England, is just getting used to. “I only started singing two years ago,” she says from Los Angeles, where she is interviewing producers for her first album. “I was always the girl at school with the not-cool croaky voice.” Once she started writing songs, singing (while playing the piano) came easily, and she racked up some 200 live shows in a year. (Her parents drove her to almost every one.) And after signing to Atlantic Records and gaining Christopher Bailey’s endorsement as one of the Burberry Acoustic musicians, she now finds herself a long way from home, in a studio in the Hollywood Hills. “Can’t believe I’m here, to be honest.

The vowels are ethereal and consonants are anchors.” Many of his artworks strive for the appearance of self-generation, be it the aforementioned hand that looks as though it was whipped up in a tornado or a dodecahedron made of starfish cast in gold. Coffin is quick to point out that this complex five-sided shape is, according to Euclidean geometry, what Plato believed to be a building block of the cosmos, but then immediately offers another read where the starfish “could’ve come together the way skydivers do for fun in free fall.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/vowel-play-peter-coffin-at-venus-over-manhattan/

The progression is both intriguing and relevant to those seeking to understand the Free Syrian Army, as the loosely organized antigovernment fighters are called.

2012-09-20,The Inconvenient Truth Behind the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands,"I’ve had a longstanding interest in the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, the subject of a dangerous territorial dispute  between Japan and China. The United States claims to be neutral but in effect is siding with Japan, and we could be drawn in if a war ever arose. Let me clear that I deplore the violence in the recent anti-Japan protests in China:  the violence is reprehensible and makes China look like an irrational bully. China’s government should rein in this volatile nationalism rather than feed it. This is a dispute that both sides should refer to the International Court of Justice, rather than allow to boil over in the streets. That said, when I look at the underlying question of who has the best claim, I’m sympathetic to China’s position. I don’t think it is 100 percent clear, partly because China seemed to acquiesce to Japanese sovereignty between 1945 and 1970, but on balance I find the evidence for Chinese sovereignty quite compelling. The most interesting evidence is emerging from old Japanese government documents and suggests that Japan in effect stole the islands from China in 1895 as booty of war. This article by Han-Yi Shaw, a scholar from Taiwan, explores those documents. I invite any Japanese scholars to make the contrary legal case. – Nicholas Kristof",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/the-inconvenient-truth-behind-the-diaoyusenkaku-islands/

Mr. Bouvay, who was in the area, agreed to go in for questioning, but ultimately confessed and told the police where the phone could be found, the police said.

As a result, we had caught up — our time had passed into sync with Cuban time. You will not need to change your watches. Then, moments later, she came on again and apologized. She had been wrong, she said. The time in Cuba was different. She didn’t specify how many hours ahead. At that point, people around us looked at one another. How could the airline not know what time it is where we’re going? Another flight attendant, hurrying down the aisle, said loudly, “I just talked to some actual Cubans, in the back, and they say it’ll be the same time.” That settled it: we would be landing in ignorance. We knew our phones weren’t going to work because they were tied to a U.S. company that didn’t operate on the island.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/where-is-cuba-going.html

Regrettably, it is not a home run or a perfect game, but it isn’t a wild throw, an errant bunt or a dropped fly ball either. “Trouble With the Curve” is either an off-speed pitch that just catches the edge of the strike zone or a bloop single lofted into right field.

Yet his prose also throws up walls, equally abruptly and equally seductively. Refusing to condescend or even pause for edification, the narrative moves along at speed, exciting us with its demands.

Intent on making a snow angel, he instead finds himself on his back mesmerized by the stars. It isn’t their beauty that transports him; it’s the unspeakable vastness of their glorious existence. In this moment, McCarthy is no longer a boy “prone to worry and fret,” but rather a wise young soul who knows to his very bones what it is to be alive, his entire being flooded with the exquisite perception that we are at once profoundly connected to the wide and cluttered world and utterly, inexorably alone in it. If I had to cut out the heart of this book, that’s where I’d put the knife, on that boy in the snow on that dark night long ago. It’s an intimate realization that glimmers with universality and sets us up for the question McCarthy grapples with mightily in the course of this engaging debut: How do we manage to nurture our deepest bonds at the same time that we honor our most necessary solitude?

Harmony, dissonance, rhythm, melody, counterpoint and other musical features were seen to have parallels in seemingly nonrepresentational visual compositions. Musical composers, on the other hand, had a longstanding tradition of evoking mental imagery by sonic means. So it came about in 1928 that VASILY KANDINSKY, the artist often credited for creating the first purely abstract paintings, designed movable sets and changing lighting to accompany a performance of Modest Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition.” Presented in Dessau, Germany, the show was a great success.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/arts/sept-23-29.html

And then we come to the jetty, a wide concrete ramp leading down to the broad water of Baltimore Harbor in the parish of Rath and the Islands, County Cork, Ireland. Two aluminum skiffs are waiting, rafted together. We climb across to the outer skiff, then we’re off to the sailboats. There is a light breeze.

2012-09-24,So Which Borough Is Baker Street In?,"SHERLOCK HOLMES, popular culture’s most famous private detective, may not be an actor-proof role, but almost anybody can play it once — anybody, that is, with a passable English accent; a long, narrow face; a penetrating gaze; and the ability to rattle off complicated sentences at head-splitting speed. In the movies the great sleuth has been portrayed by, among others, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, Nicol Williamson, Robert Stephens, John Neville, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Cushing, Ian Richardson, and, most recently, Robert Downey Jr., all of whom sensibly took the part in just one or two films. (Mr. Downey has bravely signed on for a third.) The true test of a Holmes, though, is whether an actor’s interpretation can bear the weight of repetition, because Holmes was, after all, a series character, who appeared in 56 short stories and 4 novels between 1887 and 1927. The author Arthur Conan Doyle sometimes wearied of the character, and once even tried to kill him off, but the public wouldn’t allow Doyle to leave his hero forever at the bottom of the Reichenbach Falls. Holmes came back, and has been coming back ever since, again and again and again.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/arts/television/jonny-lee-miller-as-sherlock-holmes-in-elementary.html

The checked outfits that opened the show had a slight 3-D effect, and Ms. Castiglioni included a few more eye tricks later with dresses in a green half-circle print cut and assembled on a diagonal. But she was right to concentrate on her sculptural A-line pieces in solid neutral tones, some as simple as a loose cotton top over flared matching shorts and others with a kind of crazily deconstructed peplum.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/getting-some-air-in-milan/

2012-09-25,One of a Kind,"In the eight hotels that Kit Kemp owns with her husband, Tim — among them the Crosby Street Hotel in Manhattan and the Dorset Square Hotel in London — no two rooms are alike. This is because Kemp, who designed the spaces, eschews the common practice of selecting a single scheme to be repeated throughout, instead embarking on a painstaking process of decorating every room to be utterly distinct from the next. She selects each, say, 1960s Lucite lamp, piece of boiled-wool upholstery and Filipino totem sculpture, then pulls them all together in a highly individualized, homey whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. In a new book, “Kit Kemp: A Living Space” (Hardie Grant, $50), Kemp details her approach to design (for residential as well as hotel projects), and sums it up as, “Keep it personal.” Her secret?

Nearly 14 percent of children living in poverty lacked health insurance last year, compared with under 10 percent for children overall, a number that stayed flat despite the decrease in the rate for everyone under 65.",Style,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/when-parents-cant-enroll-in-medicaid-children-stay-uninsured/

2012-09-26,Opening the Religious Tent to All,"So much has happened in our lifetimes that seemed impossible not so long ago, beside our own aging. Who could have guessed 40 years ago, when a band of gay Jewish men came together in Greenwich Village to worship because they were welcome nowhere else, that today gay marriage would be legal in this state and others? Who could have guessed 20 years later, after AIDS had killed a generation of gay men, faster than they could be properly mourned, that Congregation Beit Simchat Torah would be a “real’’ synagogue, with a lesbian rabbi? Who could have guessed that before long Beit Simchat Torah would be a magnet for both gays and straights, Jews and Christians, especially on the High Holy Days — Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — when most synagogues are open only to members with tickets? And that their open-door policy would draw crowds so large it meant using New York City’s historic Town Hall for the first holiday and the cavernous Jacob Javits Convention Center for the second? Attending on the first night of Rosh Hashanah, and welcomed as a “practicing heterosexual,’’ I noted that the audience had at least two things in common: A belief that religion could and should be an open tent. And enough years on this earth to know that there is a time to sow and a time to reap, and that the second required both grace and courage. Among the readings was the poem “Autumn” by Yevgeny Yevtushenko.  Here are the first three stanzas, in slightly different translation.

Bush, a long three decade period when government’s share of the national income was relatively flat.

While it’s true they sang music you could slow dance to — meaning you got to lean against a girl — for me, it was bar mitzvah music, the slow, grown-up stuff you were forced to listen to until the real music came on.

There have been three legendary takes on the role: Joe Mantegna, who originated it on Broadway in 1984 (and won a Tony); Al Pacino in the 1992 film (Oscar nomination); and Liev Schreiber, in the 2005 revival (also won a Tony). Next up: Bobby Cannavale, who’ll play Roma opposite Pacino in a new Broadway production this fall. (No pressure.)

2012-09-27,The Great Disconnect,"Once upon a time there was a radical president who tried to remake American society through government action. In his first term he created a vast network of federal grants to state and local governments for social programs that cost billions. He set up an imposing agency to regulate air and water emissions, and another to regulate workers’ health and safety. Had Congress not stood in his way he would have gone much further. He tried to establish a guaranteed minimum income for all working families and, to top it off, proposed a national health plan that would have provided government insurance for low-income families, required employers to cover all their workers and set standards for private insurance. Thankfully for the country, his second term was cut short and his collectivist dreams were never realized.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/books/review/the-great-disconnect.html

2012-09-27,Show and Tell,"“Times change,” says Carey Maloney, a partner in the New York design firm M (Group). And decorating books, he says, should change with them. Maloney and his partner, the architect Hermes Mallea, design houses and apartments for clients who collect Modiglianis and Roman sculpture, but for the first book on their work, the last thing they wanted was a standard coffee-table monograph, full of beautiful but static photographs and clichéd pronouncements like “Keep your silver polished.” And since the things in rooms, whether museum-quality or flea-market finds, are what fascinate Maloney and Mallea the most, the resulting book is called “Stuff: The M (Group) Interactive Guide to Collecting, Decorating With, and Learning About, Wonderful and Unusual Things” (Pointed Leaf Press, $65). While there are plenty of photographs of the firm’s work, they’re shown in the context of the book’s 40 collecting topics, each of which has its own “file folder” page. For example, the page for collecting maps, above, is followed by the photo, top, of a bedroom that is decorated with maps. And since Maloney felt strongly that the book had to have a digital component — “It was important that it look like 2012, not 2010,” he emphasizes — the topics pages have Digimarc watermarks. A free app can scan the topics pages and take readers to links on a wide and quirky range of resources — which, for maps, includes links not just to high-end dealers but also to a Web page on map tattoos.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/show-and-tell/

It’s a contemporary if shopworn story of good and evil, decency versus corruption and one man fighting the machine when topsy-turvy and not. Mr. Pen-ek has said it’s also a political tale, if not transparently so for those unfamiliar with Thai history.

This festival was born in what is now invoked as a heroic era of local and global film culture — a feverish atmosphere perhaps best recalled by the writer Phillip Lopate in his 1998 book, “Totally Tenderly Tragically” — and its home at Lincoln Center frequently seems haunted by the ghosts of golden ages past.

From the size of the rounded pebbles embedded in the slab, the scientists estimated that water was flowing about a yard a second and was between ankle and hip deep. NASA has found bountiful evidence of liquid water on early Mars when it might have been warmer, but this was the first observation of an ancient streambed.

In a significant restriction on a core element of the Western exit strategy from Afghanistan, the American-led military coalition said last week that all joint operations with Afghan forces conducted below the battalion level had to first go through a formal approval process — an effort to stem attacks by members of the Afghan security forces that have killed 51 American or allied service members this year. Officials now say those approvals were being handled efficiently enough that the number of partnered operations was returning to normal. Before the order, about 90 percent of all missions were conducted jointly. The number is now climbing again, said officials, who declined to offer specifics.

Twelve years ago, when Chabon’s novel “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay” was starting to make some noise (it went on to win a Pulitzer in 2001), newspaper profiles mentioned that the author was wrapping up another project: a television pilot called “Telegraph Avenue,” about a black family and a white family in Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. How did Chabon get from there to here? “When I first considered the possibility of transforming the script into a novel,” he said via e-mail, “I went through the usual process, apparently requisite to my beginning any novel, of lying to myself about how easy it was going to be. I told myself I would just be able to ‘novelize’ it. Two and a half years later, battered and discouraged and ready to quit, and ready to kill the optimistic idiot who got me into this mess, I belatedly realized my mistake. A pilot is there to set the table. To set it beautifully, and with a proper and adequate complement of utensils for the coming meal. But in terms of nourishment it only really sets out some canapés, maybe a dish of olives. A novel has to serve a full, seven-course meal with sherbet in the middle and maybe a last little passed tray of petits fours.
