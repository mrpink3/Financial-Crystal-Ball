There’s a shock to this unveiling. All the emails I get begin with some variation on “I hope this finds you well,” but a poem can begin in any kind of way. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain.” “Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness.” There’s a Wallace Stevens poem that starts “Hi!”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/books/review/as-wallace-stevens-once-put-it-hi.html

In his obituary, The Times contrasted the two men, saying: “Where Dr. King could deliver thunderous oratory and move audiences by his reasoned convictions and faith, Mr. Shuttlesworth was fiery.” He was, the author Diane McWhorter told The Times, “King’s most effective and insistent foil: blunt where King was soothing, driven where King was leisurely, and most important, confrontational where King was conciliatory.” The segregationist commissioner of public safety in Birmingham, Bull Connor, saw Shuttlesworth as his nemesis. When asked about chest injuries Shuttlesworth incurred from being sprayed by a fire hose at close range during a peaceful protest, Connor told The Times: “I wish they’d carried him away in a hearse.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/fred-shuttlesworth-black-christianity.html

More than two decades later, the skills she honed in the boozy, neon-lit back alleys of Osaka — the ability to observe and to listen with acute curiosity — are still apparent in her best-selling novels. “You can see where that sensitivity arises from in her work,” the translator David Boyd told me. “She sees all the angles.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/magazine/mieko-kawakami.html

And, Mr. Rouben added, “I always wanted to pair sushi with beer.” An example is their pressed Asian pear saison, which would complement nigiri sushi of scallop, caviar and edamame. The beers are served in stemware, often flutes and Champagne coupes. “They’re celebratory and best to showcase the aromatics,” Mr. Rouben said. Nigiri, along with a few non-sushi items, like chawanmushi and hand rolls, will be served à la carte or on set menus of six or nine dishes.

Yet there alongside her we find the funk powerhouse Chaka Khan, who first recorded the song in 1978; the song’s co-composer Valerie Simpson; Houston’s mother and mentor, Cissy Houston; a dance team of young Black girls; and the trio TLC. Houston recorded “I’m Every Woman” for the soundtrack of “The Bodyguard” (1992), which she co-executive produced, and which secured her megastardom such that “the wonderment of her talent and her career impacted everyone,” as her sister-in-law and estate executor, Pat Houston, puts it. The open secret of this video is that Houston had a hand in that influence: She deliberately used her status as an icon to light up a whole network of Black female forebears and creative descendants.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/t-magazine/whitney-houston-black-women.html

At once delicate and flamboyant, beautiful but somewhat creepy, the gloriosa lily, a.k.a. Gloriosa superba — which is not a true lily at all but a species of the autumn crocus family Colchicaceae — adds a showy, if vaguely menacing, glamour to floral arrangements and gardens. Bright and dramatic, the blooms are what Gary Page, a partner in the New York Flower Group, a wholesale flower purveyor (of which his longstanding namesake company is now a division), calls “visually stimulating,” and have accordingly found favor with avant-garde floral designers catering to our moment’s taste for wild, imaginative assemblages.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/t-magazine/gloriosa-lily.html

It’s a little bit of a scramble to get out the door, but I can’t wake up without taking a shower. I’ll use Éminence Monoi Age Corrective Exfoliating Cleanser, followed by Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum and Dior Prestige La Crème. I try to slather myself in those, and then another big slather of Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream and Carmex Classic Lip Balm. I don’t wash my hair every day but, when I do, I use Alba Botanica So Smooth Gardenia Conditioner. (I don’t use shampoo.) I always scrunch Kiehl’s Creme With Silk Groom into wet hair and then wind it up with these discontinued Scunci Clips to set — I’ve resorted to buying them on eBay. I started pinning my hair up to control the curl, and now it’s become my signature. It is pretty healthy because it’s tucked away all the time but, when it starts to feel gangly, I’ll snip it myself. I almost never wear makeup because my day starts so early. If I do, I’ll do a cat eye with Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, Diorshow Mascara and, sometimes, Rouge Dior 999 lipstick. Other lipsticks I rotate in are Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick and Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. I’ll use Weleda Gentle Cleansing Milk to wash it off at night and, sometimes, I use this Borghese Purifying Mud Mask — I’ve had a jar of that forever. I don’t get massages enough, but I need to. I threw out my back recently, and a massage at Element spa in Brooklyn helped me get back on my feet. A lot of my team has favorite hand creams that are around the studio, one being Aesop Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, so I’ll use those. One thing I use often is this hand wash that is used to remove sap and resin. The filth if we don’t wear gloves is incredible, it just gets into your pores, and this really removes it. Working with flowers and sometimes rotting flowers, I like to be aware of smells, so I don’t wear fragrance very often. What I do love to wear is Hermès Eau d’Orange Verte. It’s very piney and not very femme. It just feels a little sharp, like me.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/t-magazine/travel-panama-hotel-island.html

This connection between audiovisual technology and extrasensory experiences forms the spine of “The Two Sights.” On the soundtrack, various locals of the Hebrides describe strange incidents and encounters: a man who heard the radio years before its invention; a woman who saw a shadowy premonition of death; a fisherman who felt an unsettling communion with a beached whale.

Even the entry to the restrooms, a lush garden setting with a fountain, is no afterthought. The menu, overseen by the executive chef Nick Gaube and chef de cuisine, Fernando Mayers, takes liberties with tradition. “It’s not meant to be authentic Italian,” Michael Stillman said. “There are bold elements from California and New York.” Case in point.

The 45-year-old Venezuelan, who’s now based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, started making colorful patterned pasta in 2019 in homage to his favorite artist, Carlos Cruz-Diez, a Venezuelan known for his chromatic relief murals who died that year at the age of 95. Putting his Ph.D. in chemistry to good use, Rivillo experimented with natural dyes (such as spirulina and paprika) to find those that would maintain their hue even when dried or cooked and posted his work on Instagram. Now, Rivillo, who recently left his job as a nanotechnology researcher to pursue the project full time, sells his creations (from $40 for 2.1 ounces, plus shipping). And he isn’t the only noodle maker playing with psychedelic designs. The Sydney, Australia-based artist Jennifer Tran, 39, makes candy-striped rigatoni and checkerboard tortellini, as well as floral-print pasta sheets that look more like textiles than food. And in California, Fiona Afshar, 57, takes visual inspiration from her local farmers’ market and from her Malibu garden, adorning paccheri with yellow and purple blooms and ravioli with tiny images of lemons and limes. Employing highly pigmented ingredients like beet powder, activated charcoal and harissa, she sells multivariety gift boxes (from $95) through her website. The only problem with these Technicolor carbs? They’re almost too pretty to eat.

2023-02-16,Poem: [Dog Is a Way of Thinking],"Magdalena Zurawski’s intrepid use of caesura — a pause in a line of poetry — reinforces the theme of disciplined attention in “[Dog Is a Way of Thinking].” The poem’s frequent midline interruptions of otherwise overflowing (enjambed) lines creates a gentle resistance to the ordinary flow of thought. This formatting allows the reader to slow down and take notice. It’s almost as if the poem is using attention itself as a material, while at the same time proposing to describe attention: the poet’s receptiveness to language and the dog’s keen-nosed present sense. Dogs thrill at palpability. Dogs are experts at living in the moment. Poets could learn from this, too. But the real thrill here is for readers, in that the poem through its subtle formal play allows us to experience the appreciability and immediacy of language itself. In the hands of a skilled poet, even a mere comma can be the conductor of time. Selected by Anne Boyer",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/magazine/poem-dog-is-a-way-of-thinking.html

When Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has barred the new Advanced Placement course in African American studies from the state’s public schools. When legislatures are passing so-called “divisive concept” laws that further marginalize already marginalized histories, mandating that educators cannot teach about systemic racism or hold discussions about race that might cause students to feel “discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress.” With my own work often at the center of the legislative bans, I’ve thought a lot about how the word “white” in front of “students” is implied in these laws. What about the discomfort of Black children that results from what isn’t taught, the distress Black children experience when searching for themselves in an American story from which their people are largely absent, a story in which they learn about the great white men who lived in the White House but not the enslaved Africans who built it?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/books/review/tami-charles-bryan-collier-we-are-here-kwame-alexander-dare-coulter-an-american-story.html

Hoping she’d agree to paint the film’s poster, Guadagnino had sent Peyton an early cut — the artist had made a piece based on an earlier work of his, 2018’s “Elio, Oliver (Call Me by Your Name),” which depicts a scene from his 2017 movie, “Call Me by Your Name.” Through all the gore, Peyton found “Bones and All” beautiful and was inspired to make a series of works. “It was clear that it was a love story,” says Peyton, “and that love was very hard but totally worth it.” The image that ended up on the poster portrays Russell and her co-star Timothée Chalamet in meaty pinks and bruised purples, zoomed in on to the point of semiabstraction.

And sure enough, the first thing Joel imagines for himself is living in an old farmhouse and raising sheep — who, he says pointedly to Ellie, are “quiet and do what they’re told.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/19/arts/television/the-last-of-us-season-1-episode-6-recap.html

I am struggling with the ethics of broaching the subject, and whether or not I am even in a position to contemplate bringing it up. I’m a health care professional, but I’m not a psychiatrist, and would never want to cause her unnecessary pain if I were to be wrong. But given how Asperger’s is underdiagnosed in women, and the improvements in quality of life a diagnosis could potentially bring, I wonder how I could open this subject (if I even should) without hurting her feelings and inadvertently pushing her further away from seriously exploring this possibility. Ultimately, I am quite sure that she would want to know if this is why she has trouble making and keeping friends, and why she frequently feels isolated and lonely.

Earlier in the day, a judge updated a court order giving police officers the authority to return him involuntarily to psychiatric care. He had been roaming campus intermittently for a week, shouting profanities at bystanders, creating a disturbance at the Wolverines’ opening football game, insulting police officers and raging about the U.S. Army and the C.I.A. He was already known to the university’s public-safety department, which had investigated complaints about him since at least 2019. Soon a caller notified the department that he was yelling at students again. The last time he was detained, in June, Fishback screamed at sheriff deputies that the Constitution doesn’t exist and bolted, only to be brought to the ground and shackled in belly restraints.

Anyone familiar with the concept of the “1990s” might recognize the cunning of this poem’s slacker mood — the whatever and the wonder precisely calibrated, neither one of them surrendering fully to the other. It’s a road poem too: full of the sideways views of trees and trailers, the landscape lived at Interstate speed. This cool mix of understatement and awe, of industrial society and its atoms, preserves the poem’s present. It’s important and accurate that the poem ends with a hint of ironic and plaintive liberation — a power line, a poetic line “broken free.” Selected by Anne Boyer",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/magazine/poem-in-defense-of-nothing.html

2023-02-23,An Edinburgh Shop That Celebrates Scottish Design,"The latest collection from the New York-based clothing line Another Tomorrow is the first from creative director Elizabeth Giardina, who joined the brand this past spring from Proenza Schouler White Label. For her debut, she looked to an old favorite for inspiration: Eero Saarinen’s Miller House and Garden, which “represents the modernity, simplicity and openness that I value in my clothing design,” she says. Located in Columbus, Ind., the midcentury modern home features a single-story open layout ideal for communal gatherings, as well as details meant to enhance the individual dwellers’ day-to-day lives. “I love the idea of this house being a space that is intensely personal, but is also a really beautiful home for entertaining,” says Giardina. Similarly, the wardrobe she created is for “both private and public moments.” (An organic Supima cotton track pant and matching tunic work just as well for lounging at home as they do under the brand’s blazers for the office.) The cushions that adorn the house’s famous conversation pit provided a palette of saturated reds, creams and pinks, while the garden, designed by Dan Kiley, offered a range of fern, olive and sage greens and lilac-tinted blues for Giardina to draw from. (Saarinen and Kiley also collaborated on the St. Louis Arch, in Giardina’s hometown.) Another aim of the spring collection was to expand Another Tomorrow’s range of textures — Giardina added new materials like hemp linen and even cruelty-free silk. anothertomorrow.co",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/t-magazine/bard-edinburgh-home-goods-shop.html

Now a museum, the house was a gathering place for the endlessly mythologized Bloomsberries, that loose collective of friends and creative conspirators who “lived in squares, painted in circles and loved in triangles,” as an observer once famously noted, and which included Bell’s sister Virginia Woolf, the fellow writers E.M.

This year, try a sweet and festive Easter bread that suggests Russian coffee cake, from “Tava,” a comprehensive volume on Eastern European baking. Irina Georgescu, a Romanian food writer based in the U.K., begins the book with this: “How we bake in Eastern Europe, and especially in Romania, is largely unknown.” (I second that.) Then she leads you to discover a panoply of tastes and techniques, including rectangular slab pies filled with fruit or cheese; folded yeast-raised plum pastries made with lard and butter; pear cake scented with sage; and pull-apart buns, like monkey bread. More familiar are Austrian and Hungarian items, including strudels, and some entries from the Jewish repertoire: “Jewish cookies with plum butter,” a.k.a. hamantaschen for Purim (starting on March 6), and perhaps the best noodle kugel you’re likely to try, a recipe from Transylvania crackling with phyllo. The histories of the many nationalities that inhabit the region and that have contributed to the table are outlined in rich detail. Shortcomings? She calls mostly for medium eggs but fails to say you can substitute large; and pan-sizes are often odd, so some adapting is necessary.

But seven years ago I met a man named Steve Baldwin who changed my thinking on the matter. Then about 60, Baldwin was known to some around New York City as the Parrot Guy, because for almost two decades he has kept unofficial watch over the city’s South American green monk parakeets. I first contacted Baldwin while working on a story about the history of the parrots in New York: According to legend, in the 1960s, they had escaped from a shipping crate at J.F.K. and then later began nesting atop utility poles and beneath overpasses, playing a cat-and-mouse game with city authorities bent on eliminating them from public land. When I asked him if he’d be willing to meet, he replied, “I’d suggest Green-Wood Cemetery.” I had little choice. The graveyard, being a protected space, was one of the few places in the city the birds could live.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/magazine/epitaphs-green-wood-cemetery.html
