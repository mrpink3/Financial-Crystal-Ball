2005-07-01,The Listings: July 1 -- July 7; 'VISUAL GLOSSOLALIA',"This show lives up to the nearly trance-inducing onomatopoeia of its name with a seductive buzz of transmuting letters, symbols and equations. It tracks the notion of mediumistic writing or writing in tongues through the work of eight 20th- and 21st-century mostly American self-taught artists and one spectacular Burmese yantra (prayer) book from around 1900. It suggests that legibility is only part of the power of language; touch and emotional urgency can push letter-like marks to the brink of meaning and reveal an artist's personal cosmos, especially when fused with a strong sense of imagery and form. Sometimes the language here is simply not the one most viewers speak, as in the yantra book where striped mythic beasts, rotund monsters and splendidly attired guardians are encircled in palindromic prayers. But often it is fabricated and fragmentary. Minnie Evans (American, 1892-1987) enlivened ornate blocks of foliate motifs with similarly intense faces and swarms of tiny inchoate letters. Darcilio Lima (Brazilian, 1944-1991) drew exquisite hybrid creatures worthy of Gustave Moreau that seem guided by delicate numbered diagrams. Numbers prevail in the mathematical constellations of Melvin Way's small, dark yet somehow immense illuminated drawing. Symbols both ancient and scientific rule a large scribbled grid, above, by William Fields (American, born 1940); a photograph of the artist as a well-groomed young man turns into a professorial portrait (although the grid, with its capelike flutter and regal head, has a life of its own). The gyrating symbols that Leroy Person (American, 1907-1985) rendered in choppy crayon have the effect of repeated incantations. So do the chunks of writing competing for space in an overpopulated drawing by Carlo Zinelli (Italian, 1916-1974). Like Zinelli, Harald Stoffers (German, born 1961) is institutionalized; his lines of blocky cursive, all written to his mother, have the tensility of bent wire and accumulate in tight layers, like sediment, or a wayward musical score. The spidery visionary automatism of J.B. Murry (American, 1908-88) brings the show full circle, back to the vicinity of prayers.

2005-07-01,The Listings: July 1 -- July 7; KHALED AND FRIENDS,"Khaled, the reigning male singer in the Algerian pop style rai, has international ambitions for music that was once so blunt and bawdy that it was sung only at private parties. Khaled Brahim became one of rai's first recording stars as a teenager in the 1970's, when the music spread via underground cassette tapes and picked up Western elements like cheap keyboards and drum-machine beats. Singing about the problems and pleasures of everyday life in clear, catchy songs, rai singers were considered rebels, and while the music reached Algerian radio in the mid-1980's, its official acceptance was short-lived. Fundamentalist groups in Algeria brutally suppressed it in the 1990's. By then, Khaled had become an expatriate in Paris, where he continued to broaden the music, drawing on funk, reggae, rock and Latin pop, as rai's audience spread worldwide. Khaled's new album, ""Ya-Rayi"" (Wrasse/Universal), includes a song in English, ""Love to the People,"" that features Carlos Santana on guitar, while other songs reconnect to roots with accordion, flutes and hand drumming.

That rather elaborately contrived epigram does not have the brevity or the wit of Oscar Wilde, but you might be fooled into thinking it did by the droll delivery of Lynn Redgrave. In the new Broadway revival of W.

With her high regard for propriety and her tendency to speak in aphorisms, Mrs. Culver is a distant relation of the imperious Lady Bracknell, from Wilde's ""Importance of Being Earnest."" As it happens, Ms. Redgrave will undertake that role next season in Los Angeles. Her delightful Mrs. Culver can be considered a most promising sneak preview.

Next week, ""The Cut"" moves to Wednesday at 8 p.m. to make room for one of the three episodes of the sixth edition of ""Big Brother."" NBC's lineup of two ""Will & Grace"" reruns, ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" and an ""ER"" repeat tied for second place with UPN in the 18-to-49 demographic. UPN's weekly two-hour ""WWE Smackdown!"" moves to Fridays in the fall. During the summer, the wrestling show's ratings, which remain steady no matter what the season, are a boon to the network.

The European Union has a countersuit, claiming the Boeing Company receives unfair financial incentives. The two governments had been trying since October to avoid a W.T.O. confrontation.

The trade surplus this year totals $19.67 billion, a 31 percent increase over the first half of 2004. Most economists now expect Brazil, South America's largest economy, to post a $35 billion trade surplus this year, its biggest ever, on booming sales of raw materials like soybeans and iron ore and a push by Brazilian companies to enter new export markets. Last year, the trade surplus was a record $33.7 billion. Todd Benson (NYT)",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/business/business-briefs-brazil-posts-a-record-trade-surplus-for-june.html

2005-07-04,Fiction Chronicle,"PRETTY BIRDS. By Scott Simon. (Random House, $24.95.) Simon, the host of ""Weekend Edition"" on National Public Radio, draws on his background as a war correspondent in this searing first novel, which traces the experiences of a young sniper during the siege of Sarajevo. Before the war, Irena Zaric is a typical cosmopolitan teenager: a star basketball player, obsessed with Sting, Lady Di and Johnny Depp, she sneaks an occasional joint and carries on a furtive, casual affair with her coach. Then the Serbs advance, intent on purging Bosnia of its Muslim population, and Irena flees across the river with her family. Simon is unsparing in his catalog of war's cruelties -- as the siege drags on, the Bosnians are reduced to burning furniture for fuel and eating the worms in their macaroni -- but his real achievement is in realizing that even as she trades a basketball for a rifle, Irena remains 17 years old, the kind of girl who packs purple nail polish and a teddy bear for her descent into hell. The result is a portrait of resilience, punctuated by mortar blasts and Clash songs, and a tragicomic study of the moral ambivalence war forces on its victims. ""I'm kind of a pacifist,"" Irena tells the man who recruits her as a sniper. His reply: ""So am I. When the world permits.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

2005-07-04,A Church-State Solution,"I. THE EXPERIMENT For roughly 1,400 years, from the time the Roman Empire became Christian to the American Revolution, the question of church and state in the West always began with a simple assumption: the official religion of the state was the religion of its ruler. Sometimes the king fought the church for control of religious institutions; other times, the church claimed power over the state by asserting religious authority over the sovereign himself. But the central idea, formally enshrined at Westphalia in 1648 by the treaty that ended the wars of religion in Europe, was that each region would have its own religion, namely that of the sovereign. The rulers, meanwhile, manipulated religion to serve their own ends. Writing just before the American Revolution, the British historian Edward Gibbon opined that the people believed, the philosophers doubted and the magistrates exploited. Gibbon's nominal subject was ancient Rome, but his readers understood that he was talking about their world too.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/magazine/a-churchstate-solution.html

2005-07-04,Inside the List,"AS SEEN ON TV: In the 1990's, Kevin Trudeau went to prison for credit card fraud. Last year, he was fined $2 million and banned from infomercial advertising -- he's appeared in or produced hundreds of these late-night spots -- in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. (Among the dubious products he hawked: Coral Calcium Supreme tablets, which he said could cure cancer.) But Trudeau, a man one F.T.C. attorney called ""a habitual fraud artist,"" is back on television, exploiting a loophole in his ban that lets him peddle books in infomercials. The book he's selling is his own -- it's called ""Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About,"" and, groan, it's selling pretty well. The book is No. 6 on this week's extended hardcover advice list. (The extended lists are available on the Web.) Trudeau, who has no medical training, has filled his book with grammatically tortured and possibly dangerous inanities like this one: ""Did you know that virtually every disease has been reported to be cured by doing simply energetic rebalancing?"" Give Trudeau points for cheek, however. On the cover of the latest edition of his book, he tweaks the F.T.C. by tossing off this line: ""As Seen on TV: Over 1.5 Million Copies Sold!""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2005-07-04,What's Their Real Problem With Gay Marriage? (It's the Gay Part),"Whatever their personal beliefs, anti-gay-marriage activists share the theory that gay marriage is bad because it will produce certain undesired effects in society (Russell Shorto, June 19). If they truly believe this, then they should support it with data. Conveniently, we in Massachusetts have supplied a testing ground. Although it's still early, I'd like to reassure them that it doesn't appear that legalizing gay marriage has had any appreciable effect at all on the lives and marriages of straight people and their children. The divorce rate doesn't seem to have risen, straight couples continue to get married and raise families and not one lawsuit has been filed on behalf of a man wishing to marry a 9-year-old boy or a family pet. Of course, time will tell, but so far, I can assure those with apocalyptic visions that I and everyone I know are just fine. In fact, the only bad thing that has happened to this straight woman as a result of legalized gay marriage is the cost of buying a few more wedding gifts.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/opinion/magazine/whats-their-real-problem-with-gay-marriage-its-the-gay.html

Letter from Thomas Jefferson to his grandson Francis Eppes, age 14, Monticello, May 21, 1816 Jefferson's 19th-century advice would undoubtedly forestall much contemporary misconduct. It would also eliminate most showers -- that's one limitation of an ethics of transparency: the desire for privacy need not be an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Many benign activities are quite sensibly conducted out of public view -- for example, bathing, the pursuit of sexual happiness or the design of the next iMac -- and our language reflects this. To act in secret (Jefferson's word) can connote the illicit, suggesting shame, furtiveness and criminality (although not for the iMac designer); to act in private implies modesty, dignity and self-reliance. Unfortunately, Jefferson didn't give young Francis a way to distinguish between the two.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/magazine/a-founders-advice.html

2005-07-04,Michael Winterbottom Gets Naked,"On a bleak British afternoon last fall, Michael Winterbottom and his small crew were preparing for filming on the top floor of Felbrigg Hall, a possibly haunted 17th-century manor in eastern England. Winterbottom, one of England's most prominent independent filmmakers, was directing an adaptation of Laurence Sterne's often cited, rarely read novel ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,"" aptly described by the comedian Steve Coogan, who plays Shandy in Winterbottom's film, as ""a postmodern novel written before there was a modern."" (The cast includes the critically acclaimed British actors Jeremy Northam, Shirley Henderson and Stephen Fry, all working at scale just so they can be in a Winterbottom film.) Sterne's book has frequently been described as unfilmable, which is precisely what interested Winterbottom. Published in 1760, ""Tristram Shandy"" is the memoir of an 18th-century country gentleman who wishes to share his ""life and opinions"" but is so overcome by the urge to tell digressive, often saucy stories about his father, Walter (a harmless but eccentric pedant), his Uncle Toby (who rides a hobbyhorse and obsesses over an old war wound) and his own conception (which was botched when his mother asked his father if he had remembered to rewind the clock at the moment of climax) that he barely manages to get to his own birth before the book's end. It features many of the avant-garde flourishes now associated with writers like Dave Eggers and Jonathan Safran Foer. There are drawings, blank pages and a page of solid black after a beloved character dies. In keeping with the meta vibe, Coogan plays Tristram, Walter and a version of himself interacting with the film's crew and co-stars. The day's scene had Coogan/Walter leaving the birth of Tristram, walking off-camera and meeting his (Coogan, the charactor's) wife, Jenny, played by Kelly Macdonald, who is breast-feeding their baby, being played by a 6-month-old baby named Daisy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/magazine/michael-winterbottom-gets-naked.html

2005-07-04,"Paid Notice: Memorials   DISTEL, KERRY JAMES","DISTEL--Kerry James. My Darling Kerry (Passed over July 11, 2004) The Fourth of July is a day to celebrate true independence. The great country in which I lived and you live represents that freedom, that glory of pursuing a goal and reaching it. It is the ultimate expression of freedom and in the lesson, in the bloodshed, in the battle, you find the lesson. And today freedom is still being fought for all over the world and basically it's an individual fight, no matter what--a fight for an identity, a purpose, life itself. It's most important to free each individual spirit to live according to a loving energy. Criticism and aggression are fine, as long as there is not threat to human life. Freedom comes from the inner awareness. If we are tied to something that doesn't represent who and what we really are, we must get free. But the intention must be for true understanding, not for a gratification of the ego. America is a great example of what can be, but it must not be jeopardized by pettiness or greed. And the lessons must be learned before there can be true peace. But we have every day, not just on the Fourth of July, to celebrate our spirit of life, of freedom, of independence, of standing for what we believe in, but not stepping on others' beliefs and ideas. As long as there is no threat to human life. This is something that will come to the light in time so that each person can see the truth and then, as all come together, there will be such a force of love that it will elevate the earth to a new vibration. You see, the worlds are not far apart, neither in the physical nor in the spiritual, because there is no true distance and there must not be any prefabricated distance among people. It is mere propaganda and must be stamped out. There must be oneness. Independence, yes, but oneness always.

In the past the band has used four drummers -- two on alfaias, the big bass drums of maracatu, strapped around the waist.

C. Boyle, who took the title for his story collection ""Greasy Lake"" from imagery in a cut from Springsteen's first album. The basic Boss studies syllabus includes Daniel Cavicchi's ""Tramps Like Us,"" a sociological study of his fan base; Rolling Stone's omnibus ""Bruce Springsteen: The Rolling Stone Files""; and ""It Ain't No Sin to Be Glad You're Alive,"" Eric Alterman's knowledgeable and rousing elaboration of ""The Promise of Bruce Springsteen.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/the-boss-bibliography.html

The past few years have brought a steady stream of books, articles, exhibitions and upwardly spiraling sales prices. His cowboy pictures, rephotographed from cropped Marlboro ads, have become among the most iconic works of the last few decades; his paintings -- some simply printed with jokes, some made of images of nurses copied from the covers of soft-core-porn paperbacks -- are pushing seven figures in the auction market. But for the last eight years or so he has ducked the nonsense that usually accompanies that kind of success by retreating from the city to an 88-acre homestead in a small town in the foothills of the Catskills.

It's hard to say which of these miracles is more profound: the fact that after three decades with the Grateful Dead, Lesh has any memories of the experience whatsoever, or that he's been able to consolidate them into a single volume of less than 20,000 pages. In his marvelously economical and engrossing memoir, Lesh, the band's bassist, recounts the Dead's creation against the backdrop of the Bay Area's beatnik culture and its historic performance at Woodstock (and nonperformance at Altamont), but he also takes a frank look at the drug abuse that marred the group's later years, as well as his own struggles with alcohol and with liver disease. Through it all, Lesh proves to be as capable and enthusiastic a writer as he is a musician; whether he's describing the ""immense, turbulent, Druidic"" snoring of Jerry Garcia, the ""saber-toothed crotch cricket"" hum of the Woodstock sound system or a road-trip travel game called ""Radio I-Ching,"" he consistently exhibits a peculiar and poetic fondness for language, transforming what could have been a routine exercise in nostalgia into a work as graceful and sublime as a box of rain.

Dagestan, which borders Chechnya, has been afflicted with escalating violence this year, with as many as 70 terrorist acts reported. On Monday evening, a Dagestani legislator, Zubair Tatayev, was assassinated when his Mercedes was riddled with rifle fire, and a bomb late last week killed 10 special forces troops. An Islamic group claimed responsibility for that blast. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the latest killings. C.J.

He was born on August 5th, 1915 in Neenah, Wisconsin, the son of Ruth and S.F. Shattuck. His friends called him Jim. He was a member of the Yale class of 1939 as well as a student at Tufts University where he studied electrical engineering. While at Tufts he met his future wife, Martha Merrill of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Their marriage lasted 63 years, beginning in June 1941 and ending with her death last August. In 1952, Yale University hired him as Assistant Personnel Director where he worked until 1966. In 1968 he became Personnel Director for the University of New Haven, a job he held until his retirement in 1980. Of equal importance with his professional life was the continuous flow of extraordinarily generous acts of anonymous charity to everyone he met who was in need and the organizations that had impressed him with their good deeds and value. As a man he had been blessed with athletic ability and a degree of physical courage that could verge on audacity. He played football, ran track and wrestled at the Choate School and Yale University. In 1966 he decided to try hiking by walking from Maine to Georgia on the Appalachian Trail. This was the start of a love of the wilderness, the outdoors, and selfsufficient adventure that would last more than two decades. Jim preferred doing things rather than talking about them. But when asked he might sketch the barest outlines of an event of astonishing risk and resourcefulness, the details of which revealed both his quiet sense of humor and his profoundly pious belief in divine guidance. Jim is survived and will be missed by the three sons that he and Martha raised, Bradlee, Alden and Jonathan; his daughter-in-law, Marianne; his five grandchildren, Johan, Kyle, Trevor, Brendan and Avery, his two granddaughters-in-law Trisha and Emily; his great grandchildren Xavier, Elise and Johan; and his two sisters Ann and Mary.

Widow of Frits, survived by her children Frank and Anna, daughter-in-law Nancy, and grandchildren Austin, Ella and Elisabeth. Mrs. Markus was born in 1914 in the Netherlands and was educated as a lawyer. With her husband and parents she found refuge in America where she served the Dutch government in exile. For many years she served as a volunteer at the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School. After her husband's death, she became a discerning philanthropist. In recent years she made a commitment to Rockefeller University and its work in the life sciences. To the end, she was active in mind and body, enjoying her grandchildren, her garden, the sciences and long walks.

MARKUS--Marie (Rita). The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of our beloved friend Rita Markus, a cherished member of The Rockefeller University Council and the University family. We are fortunate to have known this remarkable woman, whose eloquence, intel ligence, graciousness, and infinite curiosity captured our hearts and our minds. Her interest and involvement had an enormous impact on the small ""scientific village"" which is The Rockefeller University. She shared our love of science and our belief in its ability to improve the human condition. From her first visit to campus in 1996, Rita forged close and wonderful bonds with faculty members too numerous to mention, each of whom considered it an honor and great privilege to spend time in conversation with her. Rita's scientific interests touched on some of life's most challenging questions, such as the mechanisms of evolution, the origin of language, and the development of the human brain. Through her generous philanthropy, she strengthened a broad spectrum of University initiatives, including the Frits & Rita Markus Bio-Imaging Resource Center. Her keen mind, warm friendship, and passionate commitment to the advancement of science inspired all of us to be better than we are. Rita's return from the Cape each October was a joyous occasion for us, and it is difficult to imagine the future without her. We will greatly miss her, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to her children, Anna and Frank, her daughter-in-law, Nancy, and her grandchildren, Austin, Elisabeth, and Ella.

2005-07-08,"36 Hours in Block Island, R.I.","THE same mile-high glacier that parked off southern New England, heaping up Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard for Massachusetts and the Forks of Long Island for New York, also left behind an appropriately diminutive summer playground for little Rhode Island. Giovanni da Verrazano, when he passed by in 1524, thought the place looked like Rhodes in Greece; hence the state's eventual name. But the island itself ended up with the name of a Dutch explorer, Adriaen Block. It was a place for pirates, as well as for fishermen and farmers who piled up the glacier's rocks into deceptively delicate-looking stone walls that lace the island's 10 square miles. Around the end of the 19th century, a string of grand wooden hotels were built with gloriously long porches overlooking the sea and grassy lawns where multispired wedding tents now bloom virtually every weekend of the summer. Away from the hotels, Block Island has a little of the flavor of the quieter parts of Nantucket or the Vineyard (and little in common with anywhere on Long Island). But although people at those bigger and tonier ends of the summer archipelago will sniff their usual sniffs about how you can't get good cheese on the next rock pile over, bass fishermen and others know that, in the very center of the necklace, Block Island is the crown jewel of the bunch.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/08/travel/escapes/36-hours-in-block-island-ri.html

According to uncertified village results, Ms. Malloy was one vote ahead of Mr. Flood, but a four-judge panel ruled on Tuesday that one of the absentee ballots could not be counted, bringing the vote to a tie. Under state law, villages decide ties by a random method, like flipping a coin or drawing straws. The village administrator, Donald P.

2005-07-08,The Listings: July 8 -- July 14; 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S',"This show affords a glimpse of the tip of an enormous historical iceberg. Organized by Ellen Shanley, costume curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, around a selection of dresses from the museum's collection, it is about what happened after Germany invaded Paris in 1940 and the city that had been the Western world's unrivaled leader in high fashion lost that role to New York. In Allied countries, response to war by designers and manufacturers was partly determined by officially mandated conservation measures, but new styles also reflected the military spirit of the moment. In contrast to the elaborately frilly neo-Victorian gowns that were coming out of Paris just before the war, American designers like Adrian (see above) began to produce severe, streamlined, square-shouldered dresses: no-nonsense neo-Classical costumes for female warriors. Women's sportswear took off, too, led by the elegantly functional designs of Claire McCardell. (Athleticism was a good cover under which to smuggle in eroticism in the form of tennis outfits and bathing suits.) The Paris fashion industry continued to produce for wealthy French collaborators and Germans, but it was isolated and its influence stifled. Then, shortly after the war, Paris bounced back with the New Look, the ultra-feminine style created by Christian Dior, which restored the city to its former place as ruler of world fashion.

2005-07-08,Raoul Walsh at the Museum of the Moving Image,"If you want to know what's wrong with Hollywood, look no further than Raoul Walsh, one of the classic studio system's immortals. Walsh had a prolific career in silent cinema and the talkies, and he was an impeccable craftsman who directed great movies while working under the ostensible creative yoke, including the deranged ""White Heat"" (1949), which famously features James Cagney shrieking ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"" just before he's engulfed in flames. Walsh was born in New York in 1887 and, after running off to sea as a youth, landed in the movies, where he stayed active for the next half-century. He worked behind and in front of the camera for D.W. Griffith, playing John Wilkes Booth in ""The Birth of a Nation."" Thereafter, he concentrated on directing, losing an eye along the way. Among the few of his silent films featured in the retrospective at the Museum of the Moving Image is ""Regeneration"" (1915, with William Sheer, above), a beautifully atmospheric gangster movie about a thug and a settlement worker that was shot on the Lower East Side. Over the decades, Walsh worked across genres, making Bible stories and war movies, westerns and thrillers, and a pip of an entertainment called ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover"" (1956), starring the full-figured Jane Russell as a very opportunistic honky-tonk hostess. Walsh gave tough women their due, but it is his men that linger, as much for their pathos as for their grit: men like Cagney's racketeer in ""The Roaring Twenties"" (1939) and Humphrey Bogart's thief in ""High Sierra"" (1941) who, while certainly hard-boiled, are also softer inside than a three-minute egg.

The difference in value between the assets is to be settled in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal has been years in the making, and represents Shell's long-sought-after entry into upstream gas in mainland Russia. Zapolyarnoye, a multilayered asset with numerous gas- and condensate-bearing formations, is the world's fifth-largest gas field, according to Gazprom's estimates.

2005-07-08,The Listings: July 8 -- July 14; FUGATE/BAHIRI BALLET NY,"Dancegoers looking for something new in ballet and music might find much to fascinate them in a program of four world premieres by this lively company, directed by Judith Fugate, formerly of the New York City Ballet, and her husband, Medhi Bahiri, formerly of Maurice Béjart's company. Two works have live music. Davis Robertson's ""Romeo and Juliet in Mantua"" has a commissioned score by David Homan and offers a new version of the classic love story that includes what Mr. Robertson promises will be some unexpected plot twists. Alan Hineline's plotless but energetic and sensual ""Quartet 2"" is set to a commissioned score of its own, by Jerome Begin. The evening's other pieces are danced to contemporary music on tape. (The troupe's dancers include Fidel Garcia and Melissa Morrissey, above.) Jodie Gates's ""now and again"" challenges dancers' minds as well as bodies. The steps are often off balance. And there are moments when fixed sequences of movements give way to improvisation. All this happens to a combination of Bach and original music by Dietrich Krueger. Helen Heineman's ""Hook-Up,"" to music by Arnold Dreyblatt, explores the comings together and driftings apart of a man and a woman. All the choreography seems unpredictable. There's certainly not a swan queen in sight. But that very unpredictability helps whet curiosity.

Just in recent weeks, there have been free al fresco productions of ""Henry V"" in Inwood Hill Park, ""As You Like It"" in Central Park and ""Richard III"" in a parking lot on the Lower East Side. On Tuesday, the umpteenth production of ""As You Like It"" (at least it's not ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" which has been read aloud more often than the Pledge of Allegiance) opens at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. I have nothing against the Bard, but couldn't we mix it up a bit? How about Kushner in the Park? Or Albee in the Park? Parks in the Park has a nice ring to it. Considering the lack of choices during these humid months, I bet that Anyone but Shakespeare in the Park would be a hot ticket. Free outdoor theater is one of the great things about the summer, but when will a young producer realize that it could be so much better if the menu of shows was more diverse? To be fair, the Public Theater often presents plays by other (usually dead) writers at the Delacorte. After the run of ""As You Like It,"" it will shake things up with a revival of ""Two Gentleman of Verona,"" a musical based on a play by, well, need you even ask?

2005-07-08,"36 Hours in Block Island, R.I.","THE same mile-high glacier that parked off southern New England, heaping up Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard for Massachusetts and the Forks of Long Island for New York, also left behind an appropriately diminutive summer playground for little Rhode Island. Giovanni da Verrazano, when he passed by in 1524, thought the place looked like Rhodes in Greece; hence the state's eventual name. But the island itself ended up with the name of a Dutch explorer, Adriaen Block. It was a place for pirates, as well as for fishermen and farmers who piled up the glacier's rocks into deceptively delicate-looking stone walls that lace the island's 10 square miles. Around the end of the 19th century, a string of grand wooden hotels were built with gloriously long porches overlooking the sea and grassy lawns where multispired wedding tents now bloom virtually every weekend of the summer. Away from the hotels, Block Island has a little of the flavor of the quieter parts of Nantucket or the Vineyard (and little in common with anywhere on Long Island). But although people at those bigger and tonier ends of the summer archipelago will sniff their usual sniffs about how you can't get good cheese on the next rock pile over, bass fishermen and others know that, in the very center of the necklace, Block Island is the crown jewel of the bunch.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/08/travel/escapes/36-hours-in-block-island-ri.html

The daughter of Aline Straus Hockstader and Leonard Albert Hockstader, she was predeceased by a sister, Carol Eggleston, and a brother, Albert F. Hockstader. Her survivors include a nephew, Alan F. Hockstader of White Plains, three great nieces, one great nephew, and a host of godchildren and friends around the world. A graduate of The Spence School and Rosemary Hall, Mrs. Morse was a supporter of The Council on Foreign Relations where she established a lecture series in the name of her late husband; The Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute; The African American Institute; The New York Society for International Affairs, Inc., and Rutgers University where, in 1979, she and her late husband established the first major art acquistion fund at The Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum. During David Morse's twenty year tenure as Director General of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva, the couple accumulated a substantial collection of late 19th and early 20th century French Graphics and paintings which are now among the Zimmerli's holdings. In 1983, the Morse Print and Drawing Room opened at the Zimmerli. In 1995, an expanded version of that space became the major research facility for the museum.

The defendant, Sven Jaschan, 19, was found guilty of computer sabotage and illegally altering data, the court in the northwestern town of Verden said. The verdict fell short of the five years that computer sabotage carries under German law because Mr. Jaschan was 17 when he committed the crime and was tried as a juvenile. He was also sentenced to 30 hours of community service. He now works for a German security software firm that specializes in defenses against computer viruses and worms. Microsoft Corporation said that it welcomed the verdict and that it would pay a total of $250,000 in reward money to two informants who had helped link Mr. Jaschan to the computer attacks.

Arguing that its porthole-laced facade represents a turning point in Modernist design, preservationists have sought for a decade to have the structure, designed by the architect Edward Durell Stone, declared a landmark. Extensive renovations to convert the structure into a new home for the Museum of Arts and Design, formerly the American Craft Museum, are to begin this fall.

As you would expect for the price, you get attentive service: there are five staff members for every guest and the hotel's guides take guests to the temples on routes not used by tour buses. Amansara was built in the 1960's as Prince Sihanouk's guesthouse. The single-story structure became a hotel and in the 70's, as political conditions worsened, a state guesthouse for the Khmer Rouge. Ultimately, it deteriorated. After a restoration, the villa opened to guests late in 2002, retaining the modernist look of stark white exteriors and plenty of glass. Given that many new hotels in Siem Reap are huge, hastily erected concrete piles, the Amansara is definitely in a discreet class of its own.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/travel/amansara-in-siem-reap-cambodia.html

In it, Gary Coleman, the former child star, walked up and down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, asking people if they were familiar with the clothing line Ecko Unlimited, which often features the stark silhouette of a rhinoceros on T-shirts, baggy jeans and other garments. They were shown photographs of four men and asked which one they figured was Ecko. Most picked the cool-looking black man. Hardly anyone chose the boyish white guy, who perhaps appeared a bit too much like a grown-up New Jersey mall rat to be running a multimillion-dollar clothing line that routinely turned up in rap videos.

So what, other than our propensity for buying things we don't need, explains the success of the Levenger catalog?

There are no leaning towers of newsprint, dusty desktops or eyestrain-inducing fluorescent bulbs here: instead, a fully stocked cherry bookcase squats comfortably in a corner, a suede-bound journal (sold four to a box, each with a different-colored cover ""so you can keep your thoughts straight"") awaits inspiration, and fountain pens filled with jewel-tone ink beckon from their own ""pen easel."" If all this seems a bit fussy to those content with ball points and legal pads, Levenger's happily Luddite fantasy of the reading life is irresistible.

Pessimists will respond by citing the epic evils of the 20th century -- the Holocaust, the Gulag. Depending on their religious convictions, some may call attention to the breakdown of the family and a supposed decline in sexual morality.

Sometime early that morning-later documents would differ on the exact time-the car pulled into a small town and stopped before a building with the words Hotel Los Godos spelled out over the doorway. The driver got out, opened one of the rear doors, and prodded the shoulder of the man who lay asleep in the back seat.

Born in Plainfield, NJ, he received his B.A. from Princeton, with honors, at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1946. From 1946 to 1949 he was in the U.S. Navy, learning Russian at the Language School in Boulder, CO, serving in Washington with Secretary James Forrestal and in China for two and a half years, working with Russian emigre communities in Shanghai, Peking and Manchuria. After receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, in 1952 he earned a Ph.D., with highest honors, from the University of Paris (Sorbonne). His thesis traced the political ideas and activities of the Russian emigres from the Russian Revolution to the outbreak of World War II. From 1953 to 1957 he served in the Executive Office of the President, as an adviser to General Robert Cutler, President Eisenhower's Special Assistant for National Security. Upon leaving the government, he joined the First National Bank of Boston and, in 1962, the Chase Manhattan Bank where, as Vice President, he was concerned with strategic planning of the bank's overseas expansion in Latin America, the Far East and Canada. In addition to his professional activities, Skip was learned in history and the arts, and assembled a notable collection of marine water colors and prints from the 18th and 19th centuries.

2005-07-11,Inside the List,"CASES AGAINST HILLARY: Edward Klein's new biography, ""The Truth About Hillary,"" has united (no easy task) literary critics, politicians and talk show hosts -- it is easily this year's most vilified book. That hasn't stopped Klein's book from landing on beach blankets; it makes its debut at No. 2 on this week's hardcover nonfiction list. Writing in the Book Review in 1988, Joyce Carol Oates coined the term ""pathography"" to describe hatchet jobs like Klein's. Reading Oates's taxonomy of that genre today, it sounds as if she somehow had an advance copy of Klein's book rotting at her elbow: ""Its motifs are dysfunction and disaster, illnesses and pratfalls, failed marriages and failed careers, alcoholism and breakdowns and outrageous conduct"" Oates wrote about the pathography. ""Its scenes are sensational, wallowing in squalor and foolishness; its dominant images are are physical and deflating; its shrill theme is 'failed promise' if not outright 'tradedy.' "" More than a few book-length attacks on Hillary Rodham Clinton have made the Times hardcover list in recent years, from Peggy Noonan's ""Case Against Hillary"" (2002) to Dick Morris's ""Rewriting History"" (2003) to Christopher Anderson's ""American Evita"" (2004). None of them sold as well as Senator Clinton's own memoir, ""Living History"" (2003), which stayed on the hardcover list for 20 weeks, five of them at No. 1. Bill Clinton's memoir, ""My Life,"" remains on the paperback list, by the way, where it is No. 6.

The daughter of Aline Straus Hockstader and Leonard Albert Hockstader, she was predeceased by a sister, Carol Eggleston, and a brother, Albert F. Hockstader. Her survivors include a nephew, Alan F. Hockstader of White Plains, three great nieces, one great nephew, and a host of godchildren and friends around the world. A graduate of The Spence School and Rosemary Hall, Mrs. Morse was a supporter of The Council on Foreign Relations where she established a lecture series in the name of her late husband; The Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute; The African American Institute; The New York Society for International Affairs, Inc., and Rutgers University where, in 1979, she and her late husband established the first major art acquistion fund at The Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum. During David Morse's twenty year tenure as Director General of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Geneva, the couple accumulated a substantial collection of late 19th and early 20th century French Graphics and paintings which are now among the Zimmerli's holdings. In 1983, the Morse Print and Drawing Room opened at the Zimmerli. In 1995, an expanded version of that space became the major research facility for the museum. After her husband's death, Mrs. Morse also established a series of scholarships in his name at Rutgers University.

A compassionate, spiritual and charitable man, Byron was considered to be an important figure in the renaissance of illustrated books in America. He was President of Byron Preiss Visual Publications, Inc, and iBooks, Inc, working with numerous celebrities as well as esteemed science fiction authors Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C.

A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and of Stanford University's Film School Masters Program, Byron began his career in publishing, working with luminaries such as Harvey Kurtzman, Jim Steranko, Stan Lee and Ian Valentine. A true original, his humor, generosity and intelligence deeply affected every life he touched, in both his professional and personal relationships.

""I don't know how far along some of their plans are, but clearly they're not far enough along."" The M.T.A. officials have said that by the end of 2005 they will have a plan to spend more than $300 million on eight projects.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/11/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-manhattan-mayor-urges-transit-security.html

Born in Plainfield, NJ, he received his B.A. from Princeton, with honors, at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1946. From 1946 to 1949 he was in the U.S. Navy, learning Russian at the Language School in Boulder, CO, serving in Washington with Secretary James Forrestal and in China for two and a half years, working with Russian emigre communities in Shanghai, Peking and Manchuria. After receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, in 1952 he earned a Ph.D., with highest honors, from the University of Paris (Sorbonne). His thesis traced the political ideas and activities of the Russian emigres from the Russian Revolution to the outbreak of World War II. From 1953 to 1957 he served in the Executive Office of the President, as an adviser to General Robert Cutler, President Eisenhower's Special Assistant for National Security. Upon leaving the government, he joined the First National Bank of Boston and, in 1962, the Chase Manhattan Bank where, as Vice President, he was concerned with strategic planning of the bank's overseas expansion in Latin America, the Far East and Canada. In addition to his professional activities, Skip was learned in history and the arts, and assembled a notable collection of marine water colors and prints from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Died on July 12, 2005, at the age of 87, in New Vernon, New Jersey. The cause was brain cancer. Born on August 12, 1917, she grew up in Sagaponack and in Manhattan. She was a graduate of both Brearley and Miss Porter's School. She attended Juilliard School of Music and was for many years an accomplished concert harpist. She was predeceased by her husband, Walter M. Krementz, whose family founded Krementz Jewelry. The couple owned houses in Morristown, New Jersey, and in Paget, Bermuda. She was a member of The Coral Beach & Tennis Club in Bermuda and The Colony Club in NY. For almost two decades, in the 60's and 70's, Virginia Krementz ran her own very successful fashion business in New York City. Operating out of a showroom in The Wyndham Hotel, she represented a group of wellregarded foreign fashion designers that included Simonetta (Italy), Strelitz (Ireland) and Polly Hornburg (Bermuda). In 1973, she coproduced a film with Doubleday Multimedia, ""There is an Addict in the House,"" which won numerous awards and was, she felt, her proudest achievement. A passionate volunteer and a woman of tireless energy, Mrs. Krementz taught Sunday School for over twenty years. She tutored children in after-school programs for The Kips Bay Boys Club in lower Manhattan, and worked at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in the pediatric ward. Widowed in 1992, she moved to Vero Beach, Florida, and was an active member of the Oak Harbor Club, where she participated in, and won, many bridge tournaments. In Vero, she mentored at the Beachland Elementary School and did volunteer work for The Riverside Theater at the Center for the Arts. She is survived by her three children, Jill Krementz, Christie Graham, and Tony Kent; her two sons-in-law, the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, and Campbell Luke Graham, a VP of Richard Krementz Gemstones; and by her eight beloved grandchildren: Jessica, Jason, Tara, & Justin Kent; Ian, Eric, & Paget Graham; and Lily Vonnegut.

Under the plan, 150 buildings would be checked for traces of slag wool to determine the extent of any future cleanup. E.Timothy Oppelt, interim chairman of the technical panel of experts advising the federal Environmental Protection Agency, defended the proposal and said it would be thoroughly reviewed by other independent experts. At the panel's hearing in Manhattan yesterday, residents and workers called the plan inadequate and scientifically unsound. In 2002, the federal agency oversaw the cleanup of 4,100 apartments, but there are concerns that those residences may have been re-contaminated, and that others that were never cleaned may pose a health hazard.

2005-07-14,World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Trade Surplus Narrows,"Canada's merchandise trade surplus dropped sharply to 3.99 billion Canadian dollars in May, from 4.9 billion Canadian dollars in April, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said. Many economists had been expecting that the surplus would drop only to 4.7 to 4.8 billion Canadian dollars.

2005-07-15,The Listings: July 15 -- July 21; SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL,"This annual free festival takes over Coney Island for one day every summer, giving fans a chance to prove their devotion by spending nine hours braving the elements: the sun, the fried food, one another. The festival is sponsored by The Village Voice, but while that weekly paper struggles mightily to avoid devoting itself to indie rock, the Siren lineup is usually devoted to nothing but. (Visit http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/siren/ for the full list of performers.) This year's headliner is the great Austin band Spoon, which has perfected a coolly minimalist variant of old-fashioned rock 'n' roll; the singer and songwriter Britt Daniel swaggers and shivers while his bandmates sketch the outlines of songs, using as few notes as possible. Also on the bill: the spaced-out Swedish folk-rock band Dungen, above, the indie-pop duo Mates of State, the post-punk band Q and Not U (which is to disband after the summer), the singer-songwriter Brendan Benson and the hip-hop-inspired poet Saul Williams. One group that may steal the show is Be Your Own Pet, a teenaged punk band from Nashville led by Jemina Pearl, who can be expected to spit out a thrilling version of the band's petulant kiss-off ""Damn Damn Leash."" It's unfortunate that this festival doesn't have more in common with the mish-mash city -- and, moreover, the mish-mash neighborhood in the mish-mash borough -- where it takes place; the Siren line-up doesn't even try to gesture at the diversity of Coney Island. But maybe that's the idea. This concert, on two stages, usually feels slightly surreal, anyway (no matter what you're imbibing); it's an odd (and often hot) little bubble of indie rock (loosely speaking), and in any case, by the time Spoon closes the show, some attendees may no longer be entirely sure where they are. (Tomorrow at noon to 9 p.m., 1200 Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn.) KELEFA SANNEH",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/arts/movies/the-listings-july-15-july-21-siren-music-festival.html

The problem is that persuading audiences to watch foreign-language films by directors they've never heard of has never been easy even if -- and here's my shameless hard sell -- the movie in question works better than most Hollywood thrillers and even those ""Law & Order"" procedurals with Vincent D'Onofrio.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/movies/unprepared-and-illequipped-for-a-serial-killer-at-large.html

That's when summer kicks in with the force of a bucking bronco, daylight lasts till 10 p.m., and Missoula's 63,000 people, who know that winter is never far away, pack in as much fun as they can. They'll hit the hills, go fly-fishing or otherwise disport themselves. There are hundreds of miles of trails, four mountain ranges and five major rivers, all within an hour's drive. So there are plenty of reasons to bring boots and a bike -- but none to bring a tie. This onetime logging center, unlike some once-depressed, now-chic Western mountain towns, flaunts its unpolished, industrial edge.

2005-07-15,The Listings: July 15 -- July 21; 'GOLF: THE MUSICAL',"When ""Golf: The Musical"" turned up Off Broadway in late 2003, the show description had ""irritating novelty"" written all over it. A revue consisting entirely of songs about golf? C'mon. But the show was a delightfully silly surprise, and it proved both durable and portable: it ran for almost seven months at the John Houseman Theater, and touring versions hit Michigan, Florida, Arizona, New Mexico and other locations. There's even a version playing at the moment in St. Andrews, Scotland, site of the British Open. Not bad for a show conceived by a guy who doesn't play. That guy, the producer Eric Krebs, has now brought ""Golf"" back to New York: it's playing on Wednesdays at Sofia's. The show, Mr. Krebs said, was inspired by his very calculated look at pocket musicals like ""Forbidden Broadway"" and the comedy troupe the Capitol Steps: ""I thought to myself; 'What can I do that will have a built-in audience and is going to be really simple to tour, four people and a piano. And I thought of golf, with the foursome."" He recruited Michael Roberts to write the show, whose songs -- with titles like ""Let's Bring Golf to the Gulf"" and ""No Blacks, No Chicks, No Jews"" -- are a mixture of sly and shameless. Among the rotating foursome at Sofia's will be Joel Blum, above, a member of the original cast, who does a dandy Bob Hope impersonation, part of an audacious Bob-and-Bing routine. He has had many memorable moments while performing ""Golf,"" but the one that really stands out, he said, is one he wasn't involved in. He had to miss a show, and his first-time replacement tried to copy Mr. Blum's golf-club-twirling moves. ""He rapped himself right on the forehead,"" Mr. Blum said. ""The blood was just spurting out during the number. Trouper that he was, he wanted to go on, and the audience was saying, 'No, no, go to the hospital!""'

Mr. Hyman's concerts were always driven by a keen musicianly brain, connecting the dots of history and style; they focused especially on the first third of jazz's history. Bill Charlap, above, who is only 38, has a system of musical values that goes in slightly different places than Mr. Hyman's did, tending more seriously toward musical-theater songs and postwar jazz piano. But he won't fragment Jazz in July's constituency; he's into history and beauty and subtleties as well, and his first series of shows over the next two weeks look extremely promising. Tuesday's opening concert, ""Gershwin's Vision,"" features new septet arrangements of Gershwin's music by Mr. Charlap, created around his own first-rate trio along with others including the saxophonist Houston Person and the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt. (On the same subject, Mr. Charlap has just released a new Gershwin-themed album on Blue Note, with typically ironclad focus, called ""The American Soul."") Wednesday's show, ""Continuum,"" lines up pianists from a few different generations -- Mr. Charlap, Renee Rosnes, Mulgrew Miller, Ray Bryant, and Hank Jones -- showing how the mainstream jazz-piano style has evolved. On Thursday, ""A Portrait of Jim Hall"" brings the great jazz guitarist to the foreground, mixing him among excellent soloists (Joe Lovano, Peter Bernstein) and a string section.

The results in Nielsen's estimates were the same as on recent Wednesdays: ABC easily won the night in all key ratings measures, as the two-hour series premiere of ""Brat Camp"" brought in 10.28 million viewers and won every half-hour among the 18-to-49 demographic. At 10 p.m., however, ""Lost"" drew less than half of that, with an audience of 5.03 million. The Emmy-nominated series was beaten by reruns of NBC's ""Law & Order"" (8.86 million) and CBS's ""CSI: NY"" (7.68 million). Despite the success of ""Lost"" and ABC's other first-year hit, ""Desperate Housewives,"" during the regular season, repeats of these shows are performing poorly in the summer ratings.

2005-07-15,The Listings: July 15 -- July 21; 'JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR: 140 YEARS OF JESUS CHRIST IN PHOTOGRAPHY',"Jesus Christ was a superstar long before a Broadway musical called him one, as centuries of Western painting and sculpture attest. That he has been a constant presence in the relatively modern medium of photography is somehow more surprising. His ubiquity is the subject of ""Jesus Christ Superstar: 140 Years of Jesus Christ in Photography"" at the Bruce Silverstein Gallery in Chelsea. With images by nearly 50 artists and photographers, including works by Diane Arbus, Man Ray and Walker Evans, the exhibition runs the historical, technical and emotional gamut. One of the earliest works is Secondo Pia's 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin; among the recent are three photographs by Frederick T. Zugibe, a doctor, documenting a simulated crucifixion. Some inclusions are expected, like Andres Serrano's plastic crucifix submerged in urine from 1987; F. Holland Day's misty Pictorialist stagings of scenes from Christ's life from 1898; and the color photographs documenting Hermann Nitsch's campy, creepy Actionist performances, laced with animal entrails and Catholic imagery and arranged in crosses. Less familiar are Paul Strand's startling photograph, taken in Connecticut in the late 1930's, of a skeleton crucified on a swastika; Frantisek Drtikol's self-portrait naked on a cross, from 1914;and three images by the painter Jose Maria Sert that depict the descent from the cross using small wood figures, a study for a mural and also an early instance of set-up photography. The Last Supper is the template for images by Vic Muniz (in chocolate), Annie Liebowitz (the cast of ""The Sopranos""), Renée Cox (with the artist as Christ) and most affectingly, Raoef Mamedov, in which all roles are played by men with Down's Syndrome. The show also reminds us that many religious narratives grow out of the basic human condition. A wrenching image from W. Eugene Smith's Minimata series, of a mother bathing her handicapped son, forms an inadvertent pièta. Bill Eppridge's news photograph ""Robert Kennedy Shot"" is an instance of contemporary martyrdom. Theresa Frare's ""Final Moment,"" above, from 1990, shows David Kirby, an early AIDS activist who looks eerily like Christ, on his death bed, surrounded by his anguished family. Included in the 2003 book ""Life 100 Photos That Changed the World,"" it captures the reality of grief in a way that is beyond the reach of most art.

That tour ended in February, leading to next season's deal: a royalty-free opening night. (The 2004-5 promotion, now in its last two months, applies to the company's Irving Berlin offerings.) The only fine print is a requirement that there be a total of at least four performances. R&H needs to collect something to pass along to Lord Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/theater/newsandfeatures/super-cheap.html

2005-07-18,'Thomas Jefferson'," Born on April 13, 1743 (April 2 until the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1758), Thomas Jefferson was the offspring of stable planter stock in the native aristocracy of Virginia. His father, Peter Jefferson, was a surveyor and cartographer whose immigrant parents were said to have come from the Snowdonia district of northern Wales. Peter's marriage to Jane Randolph, whose own family was one of the ""names"" of traditional Virginia society, can only have improved his standing. Perhaps it was young Jefferson's evident contempt and dislike for his mother - to whom he almost never alluded - or his apparent indifference to aristocracy, but when he came to write his own very brief Autobiography in 1821, he spoke of these matters of bloodline and provenance and ""pedigree,"" especially in his mother's case, with an affected indifference. ""Let everyone,"" he wrote, ""ascribe the faith and merit he chooses,"" to such trifling questions. Since Jefferson always founded American claims of right upon the ancient Saxon autonomy supposedly established by the near-mythical English kings Hengist and Horsa, who had left Saxony and established a form of self-rule in southern England (he even wished to see their imagined likeness on the first Great Seal of the United States), we are confronted at once with his fondness for, if not indeed his need for, the negation of one of his positions by another.

2005-07-18,Up Front,"David Leavitt, who was born in 1961, got off to an early start as a writer of fiction. At 20, he published his first story in The New Yorker; when he was 23, his first collection, ""Family Dancing"" (1984), put him at the forefront of a new generation of writers. Like many of Leavitt's subsequent books, ""Family Dancing"" dealt with homosexuality, and in this week's issue he contributes an essay about the demise of many of this country's gay bookstores. The buying and selling of gay-themed books has come a long way in two decades, he said in a telephone interview. ""When I was growing up in Northern California, there was -- and still is -- a great bookstore in Menlo Park called Kepler's, and it had a gay shelf tucked way in the back of the store. I remember sneaking back there, very furtively, and I was always terrified someone would see me. There was a lot of anxiety and fear about these books, particularly for a young person, even in California in the 1970's. It's hard to believe how much things have changed."" Leavitt, who lives in Gainesville, Fla., and teaches creative writing at the University of Florida, said that, on some level, gay bookstores have simply become irrelevant. ""These stores no longer serve the function they once did. They were community centers, they were sources of information. These days, young readers are more likely to seek out community -- and books -- on the Internet."" The Editors",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/books/review/up-front.html

2005-07-18,At Sea,"Anyone daydreaming of solitude on a crowded beach this summer might wish to trade places with the bathers in these images, part of a series begun four years ago by Richard Misrach. All of the pictures were taken from a balcony of a Hawaiian island hotel that he previously discovered while on vacation. To create the feeling of hovering above the swimmers, he deliberately excludes the horizon line from the frame -- he's making art, not documentary photographs -- and he reinforces the feeling of aloneness in some cases by digitally removing other swimmers from the water in the post-production phase of his picture-making. There's another, more disquieting revelation in these photographs, one resulting from seeing these small human figures afloat in such vast seascapes. As in much of his other work -- his images of the desert or of the sky above the Golden Gate Bridge, for example -- Misrach here uses scale to put people in what he sees as their proper perspective. ""The huge scale enhances the beauty and the sense of the sublime,"" he says of his pictures, ""but it also begins to expose our vulnerability and fragility as human beings.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/at-sea.html

A graduate of Harvard College in 1931, and Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1935, he received a Master's and Ph.D. in physiology from The University of Minnesota. He trained in surgery there under Owen Wangensteen, and stayed in Minnesota on the faculty prior to coming to Downstate. An original ""translational scientist,"" Dr. Dennis established himself as a leader in cardiopulmonary bypass physiology. As our chairman, he performed the first successful open-heart surgery in New York State, using an apparatus he built in our laboratories. A gifted educator, he trained scores of surgeons in New York, affecting the lives of countless people around the world. His residents established The Clarence Dennis Society in his honor, which is still active. Upon his retirement, Downstate awarded him its highest honor, an honorary doctorate in science. With his wife, Mary, he made a generous gift to SUNY Downstate, establishing one of the few endowed academic chairs in honor of great surgical educators. Upon leaving Downstate, he established a presence in our sister organization, SUNY Stony Brook, prior to returning to Minnesota for retirement. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to Mary, to their children, Jane, Richard, James Wigertz, and David, to his fifteen grandchildren, five great grandchildren, and to all their colleagues and many friends.

2005-07-18,Poetry Chronicle,"WHILE WE'VE STILL GOT FEET: New Poems. By David Budbill. (Copper Canyon, paper, $15.) Budbill belongs to the tradition in American letters inaugurated by Thoreau and continuing today in manifestations both benign (Wendell Berry) and malignant (Ted Kaczynski), wherein the writer abandons the cacophony of human society for a little paradise in the woods, but instead of quietly living out his days in smog-free solitude insists on coming to town (or writing an essay, or mailing a bomb) every few months to remind us of what a benighted existence we're living. Budbill's Walden, in Vermont, sounds like an enchanting place, with a ""lovely garden / sleeping quietly now under the snow,"" ""an evening grosbeak / perched on the topmost branch of the / fifty-foot-high white pine tree / here on the edge of the dooryard"" and days filled with reverie. Still, it seems presumptuous for Budbill to assume we'd want to crash his hermitage: ""So much silence / is frightening. Better not come here if you / don't want to fall in upon yourself. Better yet, / better not come here at all."" Such moments are few, though. Budbill's frank self-awareness keeps him from sounding smug for long; he's quick to include himself among the benighted. When Budbill's on his mountain, he longs for the city, and vice versa. Fame, wealth and sex are false gods, he insists, but he hastens to add that he still, at times, craves all three. These are not new ideas -- a list of references in the book shows how strongly he's been influenced by the classical Chinese poets -- but they find fresh expression here, thanks to Budbill's good humor and gusto.

If you have seen ""Battlestar Galactica,"" which began its second season on the Sci Fi Channel on Friday, you will know that this Galactica only vaguely resembles the ship that previously bore that name, when ""Battlestar Galactica"" first flew on prime time in 1978, square in the shadow of ""Star Wars."" And it certainly does not resemble the Enterprise, the ""Star Trek"" vehicle that has defined the visual and thematic vocabulary of television science fiction for four decades. On the Galactica, there is no captain's chair; there are no windows full of stars. The command center is busy and dark, protected deep within the ship the way it would be on an actual military vessel. As the actors move from room to room, hand-held cameras swoop behind them, closing in on them claustrophobically.

2005-07-18,Nonfiction Chronicle,"FAITH AND BETRAYAL: A Pioneer Woman's Passage in the American West. By Sally Denton. (Knopf, $23.) In 1850, the 40-year-old Jean Rio, a wealthy London widow and mother of seven, packed up her brood and shipped off for Salt Lake City to join the Mormon community, recently corralled into existence by Brigham Young. It's difficult to understand why Rio did this (something to do with ""a more primitive Christianity"" and London's cholera epidemic), but Denton, her great-great-granddaughter, wisely doesn't belabor such details. What she has on her hands is a great, often scary American story, much of which is told through excerpts from Rio's diary. Denton sweeps much history into a mere 200 pages, too much perhaps, and the book does serve as a primer on the origins of Mormon life. (Denton is the author of ""American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857,"" also about Mormon life.) So from a teeming dock in Liverpool, she takes us on a nauseating trans-Atlantic voyage, through the sticky luxury of New Orleans, up the Mississippi and across the Mormon Trail. Rio ""harbored no regrets about her decision to leave England,"" but that was before she got to Utah, a land of poverty, polygamy and killings. The Mormon missionaries never mentioned that such misfortune awaited the converts in the lonely West, and eventually Rio flees, though some of her children remain Mormons. Their brave mother stays faithful only to God, and, in the end, finds a more comfortable Zion in San Francisco.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html

Prof. Goldman published more than a dozen books and over 80 articles in scholarly journals and encyclopedias. In 1960 he co-authored the ground-breaking Brookings Institution study of The Politics of National Party Conventions. In From Warfare to Party Politics, 1990, he shows how nations evolve from violence to party competition via a ""critical transition"" in their political development. Viewing war a last resort, Prof. Goldman co-authored Building Trust: An Introduction to Peacekeeping and Arms Control (1997). His journal articles and citations to most of his books may be found in The Future Catches Up, 2002 and his professional work is described in Who's Who in America. A Professor of Political Science at San Francisco State University (1962-1986), Prof. Goldman served as Dean of Faculty Research and Director of the Institute for Research on International Behavior. From 1956-1962 he taught at Michigan State University and from 1953-1956 he was a Research Fellow at The Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. Post-retirement, he was Sr. Consultant to the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and directed off-campus graduate programs in Politics at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

2005-07-18,THE WEEK AHEAD: July 17 -- July 23; THEATER,"It's getting hard to keep track of all the summer theater festivals in Manhattan. The second annual SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL at Theater Row continues through the end of the month. The Fringe Festival is just around the corner. And beginning this week, the MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL takes over an otherwise unremarkable block of West 36th Street, presenting more than 50 productions in three weeks. There are not a lot of well-known -- or even vaguely known -- theater names on the roster, but, as is often the case with scrappy grab bags of work by mostly young artists, there are a lot of attention-getting concepts and titles. The festival will feature a musical about Gen X (it's called, wouldn't you know, ""APATHY"") and another about the doomed marriage of Charles and Diana. (Maybe that one should have been called ""Apathy,"" too.) My pick for Most Unpromising Title: ""CERVIX WITH A SMILE,"" described in press materials as ""hilarious and slightly disturbing."" Just slightly? Runner-up: ""COSMOS/ETHOS: FROM BRIS TO ABYSS."" There is also a play by ANNE FIZZARD titled ""GOOD OPINIONS,"" in which a coat-check girl is discovered to have a gift for predicting the responses of a theater critic from The New York Times. I hope she's well tipped. Begins performances on Monday at various stages on West 36th Street, (212)868-4444.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/arts/the-week-ahead-july-17-july-23-theater.html

2005-07-18,PUBLIC ADVOCATE RETURNS,"Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey signed a law last Tuesday to bring back New Jersey's Department of the Public Advocate, a move he billed as the latest in a series of steps to reform state government before he leaves office at the end of the year. The office, which was eliminated more than a decade ago by Gov. Christie Whitman on the grounds that it was unnecessary and expensive, is supposed to function as a government ombudsman, consumer watchdog and lawyer for the indigent, the elderly and the mentally ill. The office will derive much its influence from its power to bring civil suits against state and local officials. Mr. Codey said that the new public advocate would be a ""champion of ordinary people with real needs but without political capital,"" and he called Mrs. Whitman's decision to cut the position ""penny-wise and pound-foolish."" At the ceremonial signing of the bill in his office last Tuesday, the governor recited a list of other laws he had signed to make state government more transparent and efficient, including one that places limits on campaign contributions from state contractors and one that creates a state inspector general to monitor governmental waste and abuse and one that mandates ethics courses for state employees.

2005-07-18,Inside the List,"OFF THE GRID: No one seems to know very much about the writer who calls himself John Twelve Hawks -- he's publishing's new international man of mystery. According to the terse biographical sketch on the dust jacket of his first novel, ""The Traveler,"" Twelve Hawks is simply a man who ""lives off the Grid."" No book tour for this literary Unabomber. His agent and editor say they've never met him. Twelve Hawks communicates with them by satellite phone, and employs spy-store technology: a voice scrambler that can make him sound like Darth Vader or, presumably, Umberto Eco after a 10K sprint. Twelve Hawks's publisher, Doubleday, is trying to make this game of hide-and-go-seek work for them in the summer of Deep Throat Redux, and perhaps it is -- The Traveler"" enters this week's hardcover fiction list at No. 13. Twelve Hawks's book is a ""Matrix""-like thriller set in a society where ""the Vast Machine"" watches everything people do; it's about ""a fierce group of warriors"" who try to protect ""a select few"" known as Travelers. As a sci-fi entertainment machine, ""The Traveler"" skims along, but it's studded with op-ed pronouncements about the end of privacy that quickly become leaden. The more we learn about Twelve Hawks, the less spooky he seems. According to USA Today, he likes wine and lives in New York, London and Los Angeles. In a Q. & A. posted on Doubleday's Web site, the author sounds more like Chuck Norris than Thomas Pynchon: ""I studied martial arts for several years,"" he intones, Vaderishly, ""and have fought both in tournaments and on the street."" He isn't laconic about his own gifts: ""There are a great many provocative ideas in this novel. Everyone who reads 'The Traveler' is going to be entertained by an exciting story."" Who is this guy? Patrick Anderson, writing in The Washington Post Book World, floated a rumor that Twelve Hawks is actually ""fat, 40 and named Bernie Broadbeam.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The workshops they offered fed into a script they were developing about teenage women whose lives intertwine on the streets of Jersey City and in prison; it became the film ""On the Outs,"" which won the grand jury prize at this year's Slamdance Film Festival and is now playing at Film Forum. The movie's protagonist, Oz, was loosely based on Jasmine, and when it came time for filming, Ms. Silverbush asked Jasmine to offer some advice to Judy Marte (at left), the actress playing Oz.

In Tehran's war cemetery, each of the fallen is remembered individually with his own martyr's shrine, a sealed glass cabinet on a stand. The cabinets are filled with faded photos of men forever young, some in helmets or red bandannas, some carrying their weapons, others at home stroking the family cat or grinning during a meal with friends. Next to the yellowing photographs might be a Koran, or a faded copy of a Persian poem, or a set of plastic flowers, or one of the painted eggs that Iranian families exchange at their New Year. These little shrines seem to go on forever, each one a family's attempt to confer immortality on some young man who died in the trenches at a place like Khorramshahr, the pinnacle of Iranian resistance to the Iraqi invaders.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/iranian-lessons.html

2005-07-18,Shen & Vicinity,"The Chinese-born, New York-based choreographer Shen Wei says he's dissatisfied with dancing that's just ""pose, pose, pose."" That dissatisfaction has driven him to develop one of the more distinctive, and difficult, dance techniques around. In his new work, ""Map,"" commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival (where it will have its world premiere on Tuesday night), Mr. Shen has codified his free-flowing technique, which he calls ""natural body development."" Using the pelvis as the body's center, it focuses on innate momentum and simple transitions prompted by shifts of weight, changes in direction and the pull of gravity. ""Map,"" for 16 dancers, is divided into seven ""maps,"" or movement techniques, and takes its pulse from the multilayered rhythms of Steve Reich's score, ""The Desert Music."" Usually one dancer introduces the theme of a map, which builds to a crescendo as the other dancers hook in; the results range from poetic to whimsical. Joseph Carman attended a recent rehearsal of ""Map"" by Mr. Shen's company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, and compiled this glossary of his technique as illustrated by the work's seven sections:",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/arts/dance/shen-vicinity.html

2005-07-18,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BARNETT, BERNARD","BARNETT--Bernard. Died of cardio-respiratory failure on July 2nd in Sleepy Hollow, New York, at the age of 84. He graduated magna cum laude from CCNY in 1941 with a degree in accounting. He was with Apfel & Englander from 1941-1969, becoming a senior partner; with Seidman & Seidman from 1970-1986, where he was national director of tax practice; and he served as a senior consultant with BDO Seidman from 1987 to his death. An expert in estate planning, he served as president of the New York State Society of CPAs from 1976-7 and chaired several AICPA task forces on estate taxation, was a frequent speaker and writer on tax law and estate planning, and was a champion of estate tax reforms. He was born October 14, 1920, in New York City, minutes ahead of his twin Stanley. As a youth he sold concessions at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds (on those days when a Mr. Goldstein chose the vendors; on other days the Irish kids got the nod); Bernard was sad to report that many of those Babe Ruth signatures from the Babe's 1938 return to the Polo Grounds as a Brooklyn Dodger coach were actually signed by fellow Dodger coaches Jesse Haines and Andy High. Among his early clients as a CPA were several artists and writers who worked at The New Yorker; without betraying confidences, we can report that A.J. Liebling's remuneration did not keep pace with his gustatory appetites. Bernard twice served in the armed forces. In his first stint, from 1942-1946, he served as a finance officer with the Army, stationed most memorably in England; he rose to the rank of Captain. He served from 1951-1952 as a Major in the Air Force, based in New York City, where he audited military contracts. He was a lifelong traveler; he and his wife visited every continent (including Antarctica); thanks to his accounting nature we know that they took thirty-five cruises on twenty-three different ships (including a dugout canoe) between 1963 and 2000. He beat polio as a teenager and was a three-time cancer survivor, a testament to his determination. He was predeceased by his son, Douglas, in 1960, and his twin, Stanley, in 2004.

Beloved uncle and brother, distinguished football writer and columnist, died Thursday, July 14, in New York City, after a long decline in health. He was 87. Born October 28, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts, Mr. Miller graduated from the University of Michigan in 1942. After serving as a Navy Air Corps pilot in World War II, Mr. Miller began his long and extremely successful career as a sportswriter. He joined United Press International in 1946, where he covered all sports. In 1964 he joined the New York Daily News, and quickly became the paper's beat writer for the Giants football team, while continuing to cover primarily professional football during his two-decade career with the Daily News. Mr. Miller moved to Palm Springs, California, in 1980, where he continued writing as a West Coast correspondent for the Daily News and, later, for the New York Post. During this time he was also a pro-football columnist for the on-line news service, Sportsticker, until he retired in 1989. Football was Mr. Miller's lifelong passion, and he was highly regarded by all who knew him for writing with fairness, honesty and integrity. He was one of a handful of sportswriters who covered the first 37 Super Bowls, until illness prevented him from travelling. In 1981 he received the Dick McCann Memorial Award for long and distinguished writing in football, the highest honor awarded to writers in his profession. Mr. Miller counted among his close friends athletes, owners and peers alike, including Giants owner Wellington Mara and the late Giants General Manager George Young. He is survived by his younger brother, David Miller, of New York City; his nieces, Neredith Miller of New York City and Laurie Miller of Barboursville, VA; his nephew, Matthew Miller, and great-nephews, Ethan and Justin Miller, all of Colchester, VT.

Describing Mr. Polanski's mood at the time, she recalled his ""utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love"" as they left the restaurant and ""just walked around and around."" Ms. Farrow, 60, was testifying on behalf of Mr. Polanski, 71, in his libel suit against Vanity Fair magazine. The magazine reported in 2002 that Lewis H. Lapham, the editor of Harper's Magazine, observed Mr. Polanski stroking the thigh of a ""Swedish beauty"" at Elaine's while en route to his wife's funeral in Los Angeles, spinning ""a long honeyed spiel which ended with the promise 'And I will make another Sharon Tate out of you.""' Although acknowledging that he went on a casual sex spree soon after Ms. Tate's murder, Mr. Polanski denied that the incident described by Mr. Lapham ever took place. Ms. Farrow said that when she was with Mr. Polanski at Elaine's, he ignored two women who were trying to flirt with him and that he spoke obsessively about Ms. Tate, who was eight months pregnant when she died, and about the couple's unborn child. Mr. Lapham, who is expected to stand by his account of what he saw, is scheduled to appear today on behalf of Vanity Fair.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/arts/arts-briefly-mia-farrow-testifies-for-roman-polanski.html

""Even in nonpartisan elections, you would have to go through a virtually identical process of showing minimal support,"" he said.

2005-07-21,World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Economic Growth Accelerates in 2nd Quarter,"China's economy raced ahead 9.5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year ago, spurred by soaring exports, buoyant consumer spending and high investment, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The second-quarter growth result edged past the 9.4 percent of the first quarter, surprising many economists who, after a year of government efforts to slow growth, had thought the economy was finally responding. Average growth for the first half of the year was also 9.5 percent, the statistics bureau's spokesman, Zheng Jingping, said in Beijing. China's exports grew 32.7 percent in the first half of the year, to $342 billion, a decrease of three percentage points from the growth rate a year ago, Mr. Zheng said. But import growth plummeted to 14 percent in the first half of this year, from 42.6 percent in the first half of last year. Chen Xingdong, who follows China's economy for BNP Paribas Peregrine in Beijing, said about 45 percent of China's economic growth derives from exports, leaving the country's economic health increasingly vulnerable to pressure from the United States and Europe for China to stanch its trade surplus by raising the value of the yuan. Mr. Zheng said that China's rapid growth is also sustained by high levels of investment in factories, power plants and other infrastructure, despite government efforts to cool investment in some of those sectors.

CBS began its schedule with an ""NCIS"" repeat, which was No.1 in both total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. CBS's ""Big Brother"" was also dominant in that age group and among total viewers. On Tuesday's ""Big Brother"" episode, one housemate, Michael, was accused of sexually harassing some of the women in the house. He responded by yelling at them. At 10 p.m., NBC's ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" rerun trounced both CBS's ""Rock Star: INXS"" and ABC's limited series ""Empire.""

2005-07-22,The Listings: July 22 -- July 28; MYRA MELFORD AND THE TENT,"In September 2000, the pianist and composer Myra Melford traveled to Calcutta on a Fulbright scholarship to study the harmonium, a hand-pumped reed organ widely used in North Indian music. Eight months later she returned, eventually forming the Tent, a group consisting of improvisers familiar with her free-flowing yet disciplined musical ideals. ""Where the Two Worlds Touch"" (Arabesque) captures the ensemble's uncommon cohesion; Ms. Melford's compositions tumble from ethereal to earthy so naturally that the transition seems all but inevitable. In performance, the music benefits enormously from the textural acuity of Cuong Vu, on trumpet, and Chris Speed, on clarinet and tenor saxophone, and from the rhythmic elasticity of the electric bassist Stomu Takeishi and the drummer Elliot Humberto Kavee. But the driving force is Ms. Melford, above, who was reaching beyond Western conventions well before her subcontinental drift. Raised outside of Chicago, she absorbed that city's unruly mix of blues and avant-garde jazz. Moving to New York in the mid-1980's, she sought out Henry Threadgill and Leroy Jenkins, expatriate pillars of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, an influential collective that promotes experimentalism in jazz. Although she now lives and teaches in Berkeley, Calif., she continues to be co-leader of a trio with Mr. Jenkins and Joseph Jarman, of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. She credits another Chicagoan, the pianist and composer Andrew Hill, as an inspiration, along with the poet Rumi, the Siddha Yoga master Gurumayi and now the Surrealist artist Joan Miró. For this concert, which reinstates a tradition of jazz at the Museum of Modern Art, Ms. Melford has composed a piece called ""Moonbird"" in tribute to the Miró sculpture that playfully perches near the museum's outdoor stage. (Sunday at MoMA's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, 14 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9431. Admission is free, but tickets are required, and will be distributed at 5:30 p.m. on a first-come-first-served basis.

Under his direction, the festival has been productively experimenting with fresh formats -- like late-night concerts in a jazz club-like setting -- and this year, Avery Fisher Hall will receive its own extreme makeover: a new 30-foot stage extension will thrust the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra out into the hall and allow for surround-seating on all sides . Mr. Langrée has also been renovating the ensemble's sound and raising its performance standards, so one can hope that these Mozarteans will be prepared for the enhanced scrutiny. The new configuration will be inaugurated on Thursday night, when the festival opens its 39th season with the soprano Renée Fleming and the pianist Stephen Hough, above, joining the orchestra in works by J.C. Bach, Rameau, Handel and, of course, Mozart. The program is part of the festival's monthlong focus on the composer's European travels as a child and as an adult, and the various musical exchanges that ensued along the way. (Thursday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $38 to $58. The event will also be broadcast nationally that night on ""Live From Lincoln Center"" on PBS.)

2005-07-22,'What a Swell Party This Is!  A Salute to Bing Crosby',"Bing Crosby, aka the Groaner and Der Bingle, may be the most reassuring Hollywood screen presence of the 20th century. This avuncular pipe-smoking crooner and actor, whose career is being celebrated in a 14-film series, ""What a Swell Party This Is! -- A Salute to Bing Crosby,"" at the Walter Reade Theater, was hands down the 1940's top box office star. Unflappably calm, neighborly and churchgoing (he won an Academy Award for the role of Father O'Malley in Leo McCarey's ""Going My Way""), with a practical joker's sense of humor (his ""Road"" movies with Bob Hope), Crosby poured balm over America's anxieties with his theme song, ""Where the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day."" Of special historical interest in the series is a rare screening on Sunday evening of ""High Tor"" (1956), a CBS made-for-television musical, based on a Maxwell Anderson play, with lyrics by Anderson and music by Arthur Schwartz, and featuring the screen debut of Julie Andrews. Kathryn Crosby, the star's widow, will introduce the screening. Other high points include the Irving Berlin movie musical ""Blue Skies,"" which reunited Crosby with Fred Astaire (above) and which Martin Scorsese has cited as a major influence on ""New York, New York,"" and ""High Society,"" Cole Porter's musical adaptation of ""The Philadelphia Story"" and reputedly Crosby's favorite film. ""True Love,"" his soothing duet with Grace Kelly in that film, proved to be both Crosby's and Porter's last great hit. (Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com.)

2005-07-22,The Listings: July 22 -- July 28; 'PHILOSOPHICAL TOYS',"This exceptionally interesting exhibition organized by Sina Najafi, the editor in chief of Cabinet magazine, introduces three ingenious people -- none of whom are nominally artists -- who share a belief that human beings learn best when the spirit of play is systematically engaged. In the 1830's, Friedrich Fröbel devised his famous educational-system kindergarten, which had children play with objects of increasing geometrical complexity. The exhibition presents an array of building-block sets, puzzles and paper construction kits based on Fröbel's system from the collection of Norman Brosterman, author of the book ""Inventing Kindergarten."" In the early 1950's, Shea Zellweger developed a system of logic based on geometrical relations among the letters of his own ""logic alphabet,"" and, in the 70's, he created colorful, three-dimensional toylike objects that model those relations -- see ""Logic Garnet,"" above. And in recent times, Jeannine Mosely, an electrical engineer who designs geometrical modeling software, has applied her mathematical interests to the construction of folded-paper objects. Here she presents a 26-letter ""Minimalist Origami"" alphabet in which each letter is produced by folding a single square sheet of paper, differently colored on either side, just four times. Also made from single sheets are her three-dimensional ""Origami Buds,"" which look like eggs in individual protective holders. Contemplating the works of these singularly inventive people is oddly tantalizing: the pieces make you feel close to the creative, problem-solving center of the mind.

In one of these, the Korean artist Cho Duck Hyun has placed resin model heads that suggest the remains of South Korean soldiers excavated from the hillside. Nearby, a trail of Korean characters in rusted steel traces its way to the top of the hill, where steel panels with cut-out characters-- -- all part of a sculpture by Lim Ok Sang -- form a poem dedicated to a South Korean spy who was sent to the North in the 1970's and never returned. The themes of war and partition, here on the world's most fortified border, find further elaboration inside Heyri Art Valley's Jung Han Sook Memorial Hall, where two Swedish artists have installed the mock embassy of Elgaland-Vargaland. This is a mythical country made up of the frontiers of the world's divided territories.

When officers entered the apartment they found a white man, who appeared to be in his 30's, lying on the kitchen floor covered head to toe with a sheet. In the bedroom, they found another body, a black man in his 40's, face up in the bed and also covered with a sheet.

2005-07-25,The Seat-Belt Solution,"As pediatricians, scientists and leaders of the world's largest study on children in crashes, we think that overinterpretation of findings from a single source of data led Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt (July 10) to claim that child safety seats are no more effective than seat belts for 2- to 6-year-olds. They examined children in fatal crashes (about 1,200 per year) while ignoring the equally informative data on those in nonfatal crashes (450,000 per year). Our research, which includes over 25,000 in-depth interviews and over 800 crash investigations, consistently shows that child safety seats and booster seats significantly lower the risk of serious injury compared to seat belts alone. Their conclusions stand in stark contrast to the existing body of scientific data that support current child restraint recommendations, and are, in our opinion, irresponsible and dangerous.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/opinion/magazine/the-seatbelt-solution-507326.html

McCarthy has a new novel out this month, ""No Country for Old Men,"" and for this week's cover art we tapped yet another Knoxville institution -- the idiosyncratic design company known as Yee-Haw Industries. Owned and operated by Kevin Bradley and Julie Belcher, Yee-Haw has been making folk-art-like posters, album covers and other products for nearly 10 years, using antique equipment and operating out of a more-than-100-year-old building in downtown Knoxville. ""Cormac McCarthy is revered in Knoxville, at least for the people who take reading seriously,"" Bradley said in a telephone interview. Belcher added: ""We always tell people who move here to read his books, particularly 'Suttree.' A lot of things in that book take place near where we have our office."" For Knoxville's literary crowd, Bradley and Belcher point out, one of the regular big events is the almost-annual ""Suttree Stagger."" Revelers visit sites mentioned in McCarthy's novel, and take part in readings, many of them in bars. As the Knoxville journalist Jack Neely put it recently, the ""Suttree Stagger"" isn't your typical and tame book-history stroll -- it's a ""seven-hour literary pub crawl.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/books/review/up-front.html

2005-07-25,The Question of Rescue,"In early May, when the government of Brazil rejected $40 million in American AIDS financing because of restrictions the United States would have imposed on groups that work with prostitutes, Rosanna Barbero gave a quiet cheer. She had been there before. Barbero is the head of Womyn's Agenda for Change, the leading advocacy organization for sex workers in Cambodia. WAC teaches the country's many prostitutes to organize and to improve their working conditions, and it has spun off a sex workers' union that now claims 5,000 members. Starting in 2001, the U.S. Agency for International Development supported Barbero, with about $73,000 over three years. Then in 2003 Congress mandated that any organization receiving U.S.A.I.D. assistance declare that it ""does not promote, support or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution."" Technically, WAC doesn't do any of this, but in practice, it would have had to break with the sex workers' union. Barbero went to the union's elected leaders -- five women and two srey sros, or transvestite/transsexuals -- to ask what they thought she should do.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/magazine/the-question-of-rescue.html

2005-07-25,India Without Tigers,"BASED on an autobiographical novel by Rumer Godden, ""The River"" (1951), directed by Jean Renoir, is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. This is not so much a critical judgment as the recognition of a mathematical truth. Renoir, the son of the impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and the director of such universally acknowledged classics as ""The Rules of the Game"" and ""The Grand Illusion,"" was congenitally incapable of making anything ugly. Even his lesser efforts are distinguished by a precise and lively aesthetic sense -- an eye for fluid, pleasing compositions and an attentiveness to the audience's pleasure. Add to this the fact that in ""The River"" Renoir was deploying Technicolor (for the first time) and using its palette to capture the bright colors and lush greenery of India, and the rest of the equation falls into place. The artist, the medium and the location combine, as though effortlessly, to produce an experience of surpassing loveliness. Proof can be found starting Aug. 3 at Lincoln Center, which will be showing a restored print in connection with the Criterion Collection's release of a beautiful transfer of ""The River"" on DVD.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/movies/india-without-tigers.html

2005-07-25,Inside the List,"ADVANCE WORK: Bob Woodward's slim new book, ""The Secret Man,"" enters the hardcover nonfiction list this week at No. 4. Copies of ""The Secret Man"" -- reviewed in this issue by Christopher Hitchens -- hit bookstores barely a month after the surprise revelation of Deep Throat's identity, but Woodward's book is hardly a quickie; he had, with a kind of Zen journalistic wisdom, prepared his narrative years in advance. (Woodward is the kind of guy, his former partner Carl Bernstein sighs grouchily in an essay at the end of ""The Secret Man,"" who ""is prone to complete his homework before it is due or even assigned."") ""The Secret Man"" is Woodward's 13th consecutive book (three were written with co-authors) to make The Times's list in hardcover -- a run that is just about unparalleled on the nonfiction side of the list. ""All the President's Men,"" written with Bernstein, was Woodward's first appearance on this page. Published in April 1974, in the middle of Richard Nixon's impeachment investigation, it stayed on the list in hardcover for more than eight months. His next two books -- ""The Final Days,"" written with Bernstein, and ""The Brethren,"" written with Scott Armstrong -- did just about as well. But the book that followed them, Woodward's ""Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi"" (1984), was a drop-off, making the hardcover list for half as long. These days, Woodward's books average three to five months on the list in hardcover. The worst performer of his career, at least in terms of this page, was ""The Choice"" (1996), about the Clinton-Dole presidential contest.

I awoke that morning, as usual, shivering violently and aching from another night in the Humvee. Waking up, of course, shouldn't be a difficult or traumatic process. For the first twenty-seven years of my life, I had done it every day without even thinking. Open eyes. Yawn. Scratch balls. Look up at ceiling. Climb out of bed. Waking up in a Humvee, however, on the front lines of an invasion, is different. The first thing you notice is the contortion necessary to sleep inside the vehicle: the head dangles inches from the bare metal floor; the right leg is to be found somewhere behind the left ear. The spine feels as though it has been splintered like a cocktail stick. If the war doesn't kill you, sleeping in the Humvee might. Look what happened to David Bloom, the newsman from NBC: dead at thirty-nine from ""deep vein thrombosis""-aka Economy Class Syndrome-after spending one too many nights folded inside his ""Bloom-mobile.""

A1    Evaluation of Palestinian Forces  The first independent survey of the Palestinian security environment since the death of Yasir Arafat found that the security forces of the Palestinian Authority were unfit, and said that more attention must be paid to building up institutions. A1    More Details on Egypt Attacks  Egyptian officials said that all three explosions were suicide bombings and suggested that police checkpoints may have forced two of the bombers to set off their explosives early, before reaching targets packed with Western tourists. A3    U.S. and North Korea Hold Talks  Negotiators from the United States and North Korea held a rare, private meeting, underscoring the heightened stakes and grave concerns surrounding the six-nation talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis scheduled to open Thursday. A3    2 Suspects Identified in Britain  The British police identified by name two of four men suspected of trying to set off bombs on the London transport network last week and said the bombers used a Tupperware-like container -- known as Delta 6250 -- to build the devices. A6    Two experienced militants, both veterans of the war in Afghanistan, told an independent Pakistani journalist that they had met one of the July 7 London bombing suspects, Shehzad Tanweer, on a trip to a known militant training camp north of the capital, Islamabad.

E3    NATIONAL A10-15    Administration to Release Some Nominee Records  The Bush administration plans to release documents from Judge John G. Roberts's tenure in the White House counsel's office and his earlier job working for the attorney general, but will not make public papers covering the four years he spent as principal deputy solicitor general. A1    Veto on Morning-After Pill  Confronting one of the most controversial issues to cross his desk, Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts vetoed a bill that would expand access to the morning-after pill, saying he believed it sometimes functioned as ''an abortion pill,'' not just a contraceptive pill. A10    U.S. Soldier Admits Guilt  A soldier accused of shooting an Iraqi police officer to death and then shooting himself to support a claim of self-defense pleaded guilty on the day his court-martial was to begin, and now faces a prison term. A10    Democrats Question Security  In the wake of terrorist attacks abroad, a procession of potential Democratic presidential candidates raised sharp questions about the Republican leadership's handling of national security. A11    Shuttle Liftoff Hangs on Sensor  Counting down to a planned liftoff, NASA officials said that two familiar obstacles remained in the way of the first space shuttle mission in two and a half years: a persistent fuel sensor problem and the fast-changing Florida weather.

2005-07-26,Metro Briefing | New York: Hempstead: School Budget Approved,"Under orders from the state to get its affairs in order, the board of the troubled Hempstead school district unanimously approved a $120 million contingency budget yesterday, board officials said. The amount was $8 million less than that twice rejected by voters. The district's superintendent, Nathaniel Clay, did not respond to messages seeking details of the impact on staffing, class size and programs. Critics have called for a state takeover of the district, which has test scores that are among Long Island's lowest, dropout rates that are among its highest, and board infighting that has turned the superintendent's office into a revolving door. The state's commissioner of education, Richard P. Mills, summoned the board to Albany this month and directed it to take several steps needed to start the new semester in September, including passing a district budget.

Ms. Clark, leader of the Labor Party, will be seeking her third three-year term, with her strongest challenge expected to come from the conservative National Party, headed by Don Brash, a former banker. The country's relations with the United States, strained since New Zealand banned nuclear-powered ships from its ports in the 1980's, is expected to be an issue in the campaign. The ban is popular with most New Zealanders, but there is also a strong desire for a free trade agreement with the United States, which is unlikely as long as the ban remains. Mr. Brash has said he would review the ban, which Ms. Clark supports. Mr. Brash has also said that he would have been inclined to send troops to Iraq; Ms. Clark has denounced the war there.

2005-07-26,World Briefing | Europe: Italy: 6 More With C.I.A. Sought In Kidnapping,"An Italian appeals court ordered the arrest of 6 more officers and operatives for the Central Intelligence Agency, adding to the 13 wanted since June in Italy for the kidnapping of a radical Egyptian cleric from the northern city of Milan in 2003. Italian prosecutors had originally asked for the arrest of all 19, but a lower court ruled then that only those with a connection to the cleric's actual kidnapping could be arrested. The appeals court held that the other six -- suspected of reconnaissance work on the cleric and the city before the kidnapping -- could also face charges. The kidnapping has worsened already strained relations between the United States and Italy, where most people are opposed to the war in Iraq and the presence of Italian troops there. Court documents say the six, like the others, do not appear to be in Italy now.

The measure has been at the center of a debate since a convicted sex offender, Philip Grant, was arrested and charged with Ms. Russo-Carriero's murder. The Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, said yesterday that since Mr. Grant told investigators he killed Ms. Russo-Carriero because she was white, he would be charged with murder as a hate crime, which carries a longer sentence than simple murder.

He was a wonderful and loving husband (married for 49 years), and father. It was with the same qualities in business, and family life, as he was with his friends: honesty, integrity, witty, and generous. He will be greatly missed by many as he touched so many of us in his own special way. Funeral services will be held Thursday 1:45 P.M. at Gutterman's Chapel in Woodbury. SCHONFELD--Herbert. The Board of Governors and the members of Glen Oaks Club express our deepest sorrow at the passing of our esteemed member Herbert and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Sue and his family.

2005-07-29,"The Listings: July 29 -- Aug. 4; RUFUS WAINWRIGHT, BEN FOLDS","You have to imagine that the pop musician Rufus Wainwright would at this point enjoy being free from constant comparison to his folky parents, Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle. Since his debut in 1998, the young Mr. Wainwright, above, has offered piano-driven torch songs that have grappled with his musical legacy as much as they've chronicled the love and heartbreak that attend being young, gifted and gay among the millennial jet set. If his 2000 album, ""Poses"" (DreamWorks), was Mr. Wainwright's rumination on cosmopolitan decadence, his latest duo, ""Want One"" (DreamWorks), and the more operatic ""Want Two"" (Geffen) seemed like attempts at a kind of healing. Granted, this can be a scalding process, as when Mr. Wainwright applies his potent nasal baritone to songs like ""Dinner at 8,"" which details his father's departure from the family on a snowy night. But he can be funny as well. In ""Gay Messiah,"" he rejects that mantle, preferring instead to play a cheeky John the Baptist. The woozy, escapist ""Peach Trees"" is an urban pastoral that mixes the wistfulness of Nick Drake and the cheesy grooves of Martin Denny. There's also evidence here of this songwriter's desire to move beyond self-study, as in the beautiful piano lament ""Memphis Skyline,"" which bemoans the death of the late-1990's crooner Jeff Buckley, who drowned in the Mississippi on the verge of a glorious career. Songs like this transcend narcissism and open up a world of options. Mr. Wainwright plays the Celebrate Brooklyn Festival with Ben Folds, who has become more sincere since his melodic, snarky piano pop made his Ben Folds Five an alt-rock favorite in the mid-90's.

2005-07-29,The Listings: July 29 -- Aug. 4; 'SCRATCH',"The Studio Museum in Harlem's artists-in-residence program has regularly given contemporary American art a salutary push in a productive direction. It does so this year in ""Scratch,"" an intricate, multilayered show of work by the three 2004-5 residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. William Cordova, born in Peru in 1971, raised in Florida, educated at Yale, weaves strands of this history together without tying them into easy knots. His basic visual material is a street language of rap lyrics, graffiti tags and images of boomboxes, seen in drawings as exquisite as illuminated gospel pages, and in an assemblage of personal items that looks random but is as purposefully arranged as an altar. Michael Queenland makes reference to religion too, but, as is the case with Mr. Cordova, his is an altogether cooler take on spirituality than what we were seeing in art a decade or two ago. Many of his sculptures and collages are based on plain-style, proto-modernist 19th-century Shaker designs, which he remakes on a larger scale, forging links with Minimalist artists like Donald Judd. The real subject of the work is American utopianism, a double-edged phenomenon that in Mr. Queenland's light-touch, idea-rich art retains its prickly complexity. Utopianism of a specific kind, namely the Black Power movement of the 1960's, is the focus of Marc André Robinson's new work. And he has added striking sculpture and film to the memorable figurative painting he was producing before his Studio Museum residency. The video ""Wish You Were Here"" is a loving tribute, delivered by residents of Harlem, to Malcolm X. The sculpture ""Throne for the Greatest Rapper of All Time,"" above, is a double homage: to the religious artist James Hampton, creator of the monumental ""Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennial Assembly"" (1950-64), and to Huey Newton, who, in a famous photograph, sat in a fan-shaped wicker chair holding a spear and a gun. Mr. Robinson's fantastic throne, like much else in this fine show, is as stirring as it is indeterminate in meaning: made from floating scraps of used furniture, it could be coming together or blowing apart.

Exploring by foot, bike and boat reveals this old coastal town's enduring charms. It has been a seasonal destination since the end of the last Ice Age, when Indians fished there and hunted on coastal plains. Europeans later fished the region's rich waters, and the area was incorporated by Massachusetts as Cape Porpus in 1653. In the early 1800's, shipbuilding boomed on the Kennebunk River, and by the late 1800's, well-heeled summer people were building grand cottages along Ocean Avenue. Their descendants tend to keep to themselves, but you can occasionally glimpse them as they dismount large S.U.V.'s for an early morning tennis match or a round of golf.

2005-07-29,The Listings: July 29 -- Aug. 4; 'LE DERNIER CARAVANSÉRAIL',"Just because it's six hours long doesn't mean that you can arrive late to ""Le Dernier Caravansérail,"" the eye-popping two-part epic about the plight of refugees that runs through Sunday at the Lincoln Center Festival. While most of the 62 scenes take place on small rolling platforms, the opening (above) is a huge portrait of physical and emotional endurance, an audacious spectacle that pushes the limits of theatrical stagecraft. It takes less than a minute for the director, Ariane Mnouchkine, to transform the empty stage into a vast, roiling river that threatens to capsize a wicker basket full of refugees being smuggled to Kyrgyzstan. The screams of the flailing passengers are lost in the cacophony of the crashing waves and thundering storm. One man falls overboard and is consumed by the water. Another is shot because he did not pay. Even though this image is accomplished with simple materials like a vast gray silk sheet and a pulley system, it is an action scene worthy of Steven Spielberg. In a show that constantly calls attention to its own artifice -- the dressing rooms are exposed, the set changes are lighted -- this violent, grueling and suspenseful exodus is far too involving to allow for any intellectual distance. A terrible, unforgettable disaster has occurred right in front of your eyes, one that you will not forget soon.

From the previous month, sales increased 0.1 percent in June, seasonally adjusted. Rising wages and improving job prospects are spurring spending at retailers. The increase suggests that consumer demand, which accounts for more than half of the economy, will help Japan overcome a slowdown in exports and extend a recovery from the fourth recession since 1991.

Asked at a news conference in Los Angeles if Ms. Abdul was in jeopardy of being fired, Mr. Liguori would not say. But he said that a critical line of inquiry was to determine if Ms. Abdul had compromised the fairness of the competition. ""The credibility of that competition is Job1,"" Mr. Liguori said. And yet, in what could be a lifeline for Ms. Abdul, Mr. Liguori reminded reporters that ""Idol"" was ""a piece of entertainment,"" and that while she expresses her opinions on camera, it is the viewers, not the judges, who vote. Since the fourth season of ""Idol"" ended in May, Fox has given Ms. Abdul additional responsibilities as an on-camera instructor on the summer reality series ""So You Think You Can Dance."" In a series of interviews last spring, the first broadcast on ABC, Corey Clark, a contestant on the show in 2003, said he had had a romantic relationship with Ms. Abdul during the competition and that she had tried to help him by buying him clothes. Mr. Clark's run on ""Idol"" ended in April 2003, when the producers disqualified him, saying he had failed to disclose that he had once been arrested and accused of assault. He later pleaded no contest to a lesser charge. In a statement in May, Ms. Abdul said that she would not respond to Mr. Clark's assertions. Mr. Liguori said yesterday that Ms. Abdul and Mr. Clark had been interviewed as part of the inquiry. He declined to identify the company conducting the investigation.

Superior Court Judge Carol E. Higbee in Atlantic City yesterday granted a motion filed by a labor union health plan to allow a nationwide class-action lawsuit to proceed under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 68 Welfare Fund had sued Merck in early 2003, arguing that its health plan would not have covered Vioxx prescriptions but for Merck's deception about the risks of the drug, which cost several times as much as older, traditional anti-inflammatory medicines. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said in a statement that the judge's decision was ""not a ruling on the merits"" and that the company believes the plaintiffs' claims are unfounded.

The episode drew 7.5 million viewers, and its ratings were slightly lower than on previous Thursdays, but it won the hour in all key demographics. Repeats of ""CSI"" (13.14 million) and ""Without a Trace"" (11.34 million) were also No. 1 in their time slots. Facing ""CSI,"" the most-watched show of the night, was the debut of NBC's ""Law Firm,"" a reality show in which good-looking young lawyers try real cases for a $250,000 prize. It caused barely a ripple, bringing in 5.09 million viewers and placing third among 18-to-49-year-olds. Making matters worse, before the first two contestants were eliminated, scenes from next week's show were broadcast during a commercial break, revealing who the axed lawyers were.

He was 89 years old and for years fought Parkinson's Disease with great courage and success. Beloved and adoring husband of Antje, his wife of 30 years. Loving and supportive father of Lindy Linder, Peggy Farber, Felicia Farber Gervais and the late Robert Farber. Grandfather of Liza and Luke Linder, Ben and Sam Jacoff. Loving and supportive father - in - law to Charles S. Gervais, uncle to Eric W. Deckinger and so many more. Born in New York, Leonard skipped college as his father, Morris, died when Leonard was 17 years old and he had to work to support mother Clara and sister Norma. A non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, he received the Purple Heart and two Bronze Stars for his bravery and heroism during his duty in Europe during WWII. Leonard was Chairman of Leonard L. Farber Company, a shopping center development firm that had its first seeds of formation in the early 1950's when Leonard and a small group of visionaries began building suburban shopping centers. Leonard was a pioneer in this new industry and was the founding President of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which he helped found in 1957. By this year the organization, now known as the ""ICSC"", has 45,000 members worldwide, up from the approximate seven original members so many years ago. Over the course of his career, Leonard developed 45 shopping centers from California to Puerto Rico. Leonard received the Horatio Alger Award in 1985 and his Honorary Degree from Brandeis University in 1989. He also served as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Brandeis in the mid 1980's where he built the Leonard L. Farber Library and the Robert D. Farber University Archives. President Jimmy Carter appointed Leonard in 1979, to serve on the board of the National Endowment for the Arts. Leonard also was an active community leader, philanthropist and friend. He served over the years on many boards as well as being a donor to many organizations and causes, most notably, The Broward Center for the Performance Arts, The Ft. Lauderdale Symphony Orchestra, The Museum of Arts, The Boys and Girls Club of Ft. Lauderdale, Nova University, Brandeis University, and the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Leonard loved most to cruise on his boat Stoneface, with wife and ""1st mate"", Antje. He especially enjoyed their summers cruising up the Eastern seaboard to their home away from home, Nantucket Harbor. He was always happiest aboard Stoneface and hosting family and friends in ports in the Caribbean to Bar Harbor to Capri - and all points in between. Leonard's love of life, sensitivity to others, leadership position in so many roles, and determination served as a beacon and role model to all those lucky enough to know him. A Funeral will be held at 2:00p.m. on Sunday, July 31st, at Temple Kol Ami Emanu-El at 8200 Peters Road Plantation, Fla.

Founding partner of High Rise Capital Management, former director of Citigroup, former comanaging partner of First Manhattan Company, ViceChairman of Carnegie Hall and Trustee of Teachers College. Beloved husband of Judy. Loving father of Kenneth, Thomas, Mark and James. Cherished grandfather of Maura and Andrew. Devoted brother of Martin and Jeffrey. Services at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street, Sunday 11:30AM. Contributions in his memory may be made to Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall 881 Seventh Avenue, NY, NY 10019. ZANKEL--Arthur. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the loss of beloved friend and dedicated Trustee Arthur Zankel, who died on July 28, 2005, at the age of 73. Arthur joined the Board of Carnegie Hall in 1992, and for more than a decade provided this institution with expert leadership and sound financial advice, overseeing, in particular, the steady growth of the Hall's endowment fund. Arthur's unbounded generosity to Carnegie Hall and his unstinting conviction that all lovers of great music should find a home here led to the opening of Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall in September 2003, a watershed event that has created the opportunity for Carnegie Hall to welcome truly diverse great music from around the globe, and provided a technological platform for outreach to new audiences worldwide. Arthur will be remembered fondly for his genuine warmth, his extraordinary humor, and his uncanny ability to make you feel that you were the most important person in the world. In Judy, he found an equally caring and gracious partner, who shared his deep love of music and his great passion for life. All of us at Carnegie Hall feel personally bereft by this sudden and unexpected loss. We express our heartfelt condolences to Judy, and to James, Kenneth, Mark, Thomas, and the extended family. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell-The Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Sanford I. Weill Chairman of the Board ZANKEL--Arthur, financier and philanthropist. Mr. Zankel was a longtime trusted advisor who joined Citigroup's Board of Directors at its inception in 1986. His experience and judgment helped the company grow from Commercial Credit into Citigroup -- a journey of remarkable accomplishment. Mr. Zankel served Citigroup for more than a decade as chairman of the personnel and compensation committee. As a member of the succession subcommittee, he helped to assure the extraordinarily smooth transition to Citigroup's new CEO and COO structure in 2003. When Mr. Zankel retired from the Board in 2004, Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill said, ""It's not an exaggeration to say that no company approaching our size and scale and depth of management talent has ever had such a successful, virtually seamless transition. Arthur deserves much of the credit."" Citigroup appreciates his years of dedicated service and extends its condolences to his wife Judy, and sons, James, Mark, Thomas, and Kenneth. A memorial service will be held Sunday, July 31, 2005, at 11:30 AM, at Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York, New York 10028; 212288-3500. ZANKEL--Arthur. Teachers College is deeply saddened at the passing of Arthur Zankel, Vice Chairman of our Board of Trustees. Arthur was a highly intelligent and caring man who never forgot his roots. He had a wonderful sense of humor and was a wise counselor who knew what he believed and never took himself too seriously. He was a good and caring friend. He was deeply in love with his wife, Judy, and his children. He was passionate about the need to improve the lives of the children who have the least. He gave generously of his time and resources to accomplish this. Our world is a better place and our lives have been enriched because Arthur Zankel walked among us. There can be no higher measure of success in life. His passing is a profound loss to all who were touched by his enthusiasm and generosity. Our thoughts are with his wife, Judy, and his four children. Arthur Levine, President John C. Hyland William D. Rueckert Co-Chairs Board of Trustees Teachers College Columbia University ZANKEL--Arthur. Our hearts are broken over the tragic loss of our dearest friend Arthur. With his wisdom, his warmth and compassion, his sensible advice and his outrageous sense of humor he was such an important part of our lives and our decisions. He was always there for us, ready to take ""a walk in the woods"" or ""a swim in the pool"". Our New Year's weekends will never be the same, but we are so lucky to have those treasured memories of our time together. Our hearts go out to his beloved wife Judy who made him so very happy in the eight years of their marriage. He also felt such pride and love for his boys Kenny, Tommy, Mark and Jimmy, their spouses and his grandchildren. Arthur, we already miss you, and we will never forget all you have been to us. May you rest in peace, dear friend. With all our love. Joan and Sandy Weill ZANKEL--Arthur. The Alan Greene family deeply mourns the loss of a great friend and confidant, Arthur Zankel.

2005-08-01,Inside the List,"OLD SCHOOL: John Irving's 11th novel, ""Until I Find You,"" enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 3. The book's reviews have been, for the most part, fairly brutal. (Writing in The Washington Post Book World, Marianne Wiggins complained that Irving's sex-driven novel ""goes for over 800 pages and leaves one with an even greater appreciation for the Viagra label's warning of penile erectile states that might last up to four or five hours. Make it stop!"") Irving's brand of leisurely, old-school storytelling has legions of admirers, however, and sales of his new book have been given a push by profiles of the author in People and Entertainment Weekly that underscored this novel's autobiographical aspects. (Like his book's hero, Irving had a father who went missing early in his life and, like his book's hero, he was molested by a much older woman before he was in his teens.) Irving's first three novels -- ""Setting Free the Bears,"" ""The Water-Method Man"" and ""The 158-Pound Marriage"" -- did not make the Times list. His fourth, ""The World According to Garp,"" was his shot heard round the world; it spent almost six months on the hardcover fiction list in 1978-79. Since then, all of his books have had substantial runs on this page, with the exception of ""Trying to Save Piggy Sneed"" (1996), a collection of assorted prose, and his memoir, ""My Movie Business"" (1999), both of which failed to climb into the hardcover Top 15.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The machine, which blows a series of puffs of air at each person who steps inside it, is the first the security administration has delivered since it completed a test of the machines last spring at 14 airports. It may help to allay some of the concerns raised by recent blunders at the airport, including a traveler's discovery in February that she had cleared security with a five-inch butcher knife in her handbag. In December, screeners lost track of a fake bomb being used in a training exercise, and it wound up on a plane to Amsterdam. But the new machine will not significantly reduce the need for a vigilant staff of screeners. It will simply add another, more sensitive layer of defense against terrorist threats, said Anthony R.

Dr. Theodore Alexander. 85, a former provost of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the City University of New York (CUNY), and formerly president of San Francisco Theological Seminary, died Friday, June 10, 2005, in Princeton, NJ following a lengthy illness. Born in Eveleth, MN on January 7, 1920, Ted Gill was educated at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Princeton Theological Seminary, Union Seminary in New York City, and the University of Zurich. After serving Presbyterian parishes in New Rochelle, NY and West End Presbyterian Church in New York City, he became professor of religion at Lindenwood College in St. Charles, MO, and subsequently managing editor of The Christian Century magazine in Chicago. He was president of San Francisco Theological Seminary from 1958 to 1966, leaving that position to occupy the higher education desk of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland. He joined the faculty of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in midtown Manhattan where he remained from 1971 through 1989. In retirement, he served as theologian in residence at Nassau Presbyterian Church in Princeton, NJ. At the time of his death, he was a member of the Presbytery of New York City in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

2005-08-01,The Arsenal: Gelée,"The hallmarks of French food -- the silkiness of a foie gras terrine, the crunch of duck skin, the weightless deceit of a good soufflé -- are often about texture. On a recent trip to Paris, I noticed that the texture that seemed to be on every chef's mind was the soft, wobbly chill of gelées -- which are essentially Jell-O made with real flavors. Chefs blend fruit and vegetable juices, and even broths, with plain gelatin, then use bits of the chilled gelées as a flavoring component -- lemon verbena gelée in a lobster salad, say, or squares of plum gelée surrounding an almond cake. One chef dotted a salad of asparagus and beets with a version made from chicken stock and dressed the vegetables with a spicy paprika vinaigrette. Gelées can be loose or firm. (One packet of powdered gelatin mixed with two cups of liquid will yield a firm gelée.) They are an especially handy touch in summer, when a cool and sparkling spoonful can intensify a dish's flavor at the same time it refreshes.

He graduated New York University Law School in 1928 and began practicing law. He started his law career at Pines and Sterling, a leading firm in Peekskill, where his starting salary was $5 per week. He practiced until 1970 when he formed a partnership, Hersh and Hersh P.C., with his sons, which is still carried on by his son, Robert, at the old County Trust Bank Building located on Central Avenue in Peekskill. Never afraid of hard work, Ben was at the office every day well past his 90th birthday. An accomplished attorney, Ben was at times, Counsel to Peekskill Hospital, Counsel to the Mohegan Fire District, and Counsel to Caring for the Homeless of Peekskill. He served as Special Counsel to the Town of Cortlandt and was a Trustee of The Security Title Company. He served a term as director of the YWCA, although, as he put it, he was neither young, nor a woman, nor Christian. In the sixties, he served as closing attorney for Chase Manhattan Bank. During the term of Peekskill mayor Michael J. Dibart, Ben served as Prosecutor for the City of Peekskill. He was also elected to the Board of Directors for the Westchester County National Bank. While still a student at Columbia Law School, Governor George Pataki clerked for Ben Hersh and got his first experience in the practice of law. Ben was a longtime friend of the Pataki family, and represented the Governor's father, and grandfather. Two of his siblings followed Ben into the practice of law; Jerome and Frederick. So did his two sons, Robert and Philip as well as three of his nephews, Eric, John, and Scot. All continue to practice on the same street in Peekskill, except for Eric who is deceased. The legacy of attorneys seems to be continuing as Ben's granddaughter, Sarah, graduated Denver Law School in May 2005. An active member of the First Hebrew Congregation, Ben Hersh served three terms as president. As Chairman of the Building Committee, he was instrumental in the property acquisition and construction of the First Hebrew's Rt. 6 Building in Peekskill.

2005-08-01,"Paid Notice: Deaths   FARBER, LEONARD L.","FARBER--Leonard L. On July 28, 2005, Leonard died peacefully in his home in Fort Lauderdale, FL. He was 89 years old and for years fought Parkinson's Disease with great courage and success. Beloved and adoring husband of Antje, his wife of 30 years. Loving and supportive father of Lindy Linder, Peggy Farber, Felicia Farber Gervais and the late Robert Farber. Grandfather of Liza and Luke Linder, Ben and Sam Jacoff. Loving and supportive father - in - law to Charles S. Gervais, uncle to Eric W. Deckinger and so many more. Born in New York, Leonard skipped college as his father, Morris, died when Leonard was 17 years old and he had to work to support mother Clara and sister Norma. A non-commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, he received the Purple Heart and two Bronze Stars for his bravery and heroism during his duty in Europe during WWII. Leonard was Chairman of Leonard L. Farber Company, a shopping center development firm that had its first seeds of formation in the early 1950's when Leonard and a small group of visionaries began building suburban shopping centers. Leonard was a pioneer in this new industry and was the founding President of the International Council of Shopping Centers, which he helped found in 1957. By this year the organization, now known as the ""ICSC"", has 45,000 members worldwide, up from the approximate seven original members so many years ago. Over the course of his career, Leonard developed 45 shopping centers from California to Puerto Rico. Leonard received the Horatio Alger Award in 1985 and his Honorary Degree from Brandeis University in 1989. He also served as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Brandeis in the mid 1980's where he built the Leonard L. Farber Library and the Robert D. Farber University Archives. President Jimmy Carter appointed Leonard in 1979, to serve on the board of the National Endowment for the Arts. Leonard also was an active community leader, philanthropist and friend. He served over the years on many boards as well as being a donor to many organizations and causes, most notably, The Broward Center for the Performance Arts, The Ft. Lauderdale Symphony Orchestra, The Museum of Arts, The Boys and Girls Club of Ft. Lauderdale, Nova University, Brandeis University, and the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Leonard loved most to cruise on his boat Stoneface, with wife and ""1st mate"", Antje. He especially enjoyed their summers cruising up the Eastern seaboard to their home away from home, Nantucket Harbor. He was always happiest aboard Stoneface and hosting family and friends in ports in the Caribbean to Bar Harbor to Capri - and all points in between. Leonard's love of life, sensitivity to others, leadership position in so many roles, and determination served as a beacon and role model to all those lucky enough to know him. A Funeral will be held at 2:00p.m. on Sunday, July 31st, at Temple Kol Ami Emanu-El at 8200 Peters Road Plantation, Fla. In Lieu of flowers the family requests memorial gifts be made in Leonard?s honor to The National Parkinson's Foundation or the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/classified/paid-notice-deaths-farber-leonard-l.html

He possesses what scouts call ""plus tools"" -- a strong arm, soft hands, speed and power -- as well as a ""good body."" Lean and muscular, he appears in no danger of growing fat. Right now, he's listed at 6-foot-3 and 176 pounds, but with better nutrition and weight training, the Mets' senior scout for the Dominican Republic, Eddy Toledo, expects him to put on 25 pounds of muscle over the next few years.

While other directors may be hailed for their originality and independent point of view, Jarmusch, unlike Quentin Tarantino or pretty much any other auteur, has never made a film under a studio's watch. Ever since his debut feature, ""Stranger Than Paradise,"" in 1984, which cost $150,000, grossed $2.5 million in North America, won the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form, he has owned and controlled all of his movies.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/magazine/the-last-of-the-indies.html

2005-08-01,Nonfiction Chronicle,"IN THE SHADOWS OF HISTORY: Fifty Years Behind the Scenes of Cold War Diplomacy. By Chester L. Cooper. (Prometheus, $28.) The unmasking of W. Mark Felt as Deep Throat is a reminder of the power of a No. 2: he wasn't the boss, but he was twice as dangerous. Cooper's political memoir opens with the claim that in his long career as a senior officer in the C.I.A. and various other federal agencies -- ""as deputy or special assistant to, of or for somebody or something"" -- he has had a wisdom far beyond that of his high-powered but short-term bosses. A promising hypothesis, but what Cooper's experience shows -- from minor O.S.S. operations in China during World War II through Korea, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam and other conflicts -- is that bureaucratic work, even all the way (or almost all the way) to the top, is always dull and usually inconsequential. During the Suez crisis of 1956, as the British-French-Israeli plan to recover the canal from Egypt builds to a dangerous standoff, our hero wrings his hands for a while and then plays Monopoly with his family; in 1966 he rubber-stamps an empty promise from President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw troops from Vietnam within six months. Cooper describes every diplomatic tea party and handshake in fetishistic detail, but his role is never clear, nor are any of those vital lessons from history.

One day, he walked into a country store there, Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market, and, on a dare, said something fresh to the white woman behind the counter -- 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the owner's wife -- or asked her for a date, or maybe wolf-whistled at her. A few nights later, her husband, Roy Bryant, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, yanked young Till out of bed and off into the dark Delta, where they beat, tortured and, ultimately, shot him in the head and pushed him into the Tallahatchie River. His body, though tied to a heavy cotton-gin fan with barbed wire, surfaced a few days later, whereupon Bryant and Milam were arrested and charged with murder.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/magazine/the-ghosts-of-emmett-till.html

2005-08-01,'The Lady and the Panda'," It was a bitter winter night, February 19, 1936, and on the outskirts of Shanghai, far from the neon and the wailing jazz, thirty-four-year-old William Harvest Harkness, Jr., lay in a private hospital, blood-stiffened silk sutures tracking across his pale abdomen. He was dying, and alone in his agony. His original expedition mates, four adventurous men with dreams of capturing the giant panda, had all deserted him long before. Though he knew people in the city from previous trips and more recent escapades in notorious nightclubs and bars, in the end he had stayed true to some deeper nature, pushing them all away and stealing off in secret. His family, including his young wife back in Manhattan, had no idea he was even sick. With what little strength he could summon, he had been writing sunny notes home that masked his horrible condition. Perhaps he really believed his own words, for just weeks earlier he had been pressuring the doctor to release him so he could get back to his campaign. But, finally, on this frigid night, scarred by other attempts to scalpel tumors from his neck and torso and wretched from his latest incision, he found himself unable to eat or drink, then even to breathe. The sportsman who lived to rough it in the wild died under starched white sheets, in a ward reeking of antiseptic. His young life had ended in the pursuit of the most mysterious animal of his time, yet he had never managed to set a laced boot in the great snow-covered mountains that separated China and Tibet.
