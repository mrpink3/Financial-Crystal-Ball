There are many reasons. For one, it’s long. At the opera’s 1842 premiere in Dresden, the performance, including intermissions separating its five acts, ran more than six hours. Wagner later sanctioned many cuts to make the piece more doable. “Rienzi” also poses epic challenges, including a big chorus, marches and processions.

2012-02-01,Map of Earthquake Risks Is Updated,"A new map detailing all known geologic faults east of Denver was issued Tuesday by the government and a nonprofit electric research group, opening the way for nuclear power plants in the United States to embark on a broad re-evaluation of their vulnerability to earthquakes. It was the first major update of the map since 1989. While researchers began the computer modeling for the map long before the earthquake and tsunami that caused last year’s Fukushima Daiichi plant disaster in Japan, that calamity lent urgency to a renewed effort to assess the American plants. Further concerns were raised by a quake last summer near Mineral, Va., that shook a twin-reactor plant there beyond the extent that its designers anticipated, resulting in its shutdown for safety checks. The study does not calculate the risk of damage from an earthquake or even specify what amount of ground motion is likely at the reactor sites, leaving that to their owners. “The model is the first step,” said Scott Brunell, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The computer model was developed by the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium, with help from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Physicists faced a similar dilemma in the 1940s when publishing nuclear weapons research, the panel said.

After a Marine unit found nine I.E.D.’s hidden beneath Ugly Hill’s scarred and caverned faces last year, coalition forces seldom ventured near it. Until one night this October, when members of Echo Company, from the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines — known since Vietnam as the Magnificent Bastards — quietly sneaked into Juz Ghoray and posted signs on people’s doors and windows. Their idea was to co-opt the infamous Taliban practice of intimidating government sympathizers with night letters threatening execution. The Marines’ signs were bordered with the nation’s colors, and in Pashto and Dari they announced: “The Afghan National Security Forces are coming.” Two weeks later, about 60 members of Echo Company, along with 30 Afghan National Army soldiers, traveled on foot through the night and took Ugly Hill without a shot. At dawn, as villagers emerged from their homes, they found laborers stacking bastions to fortify a new Afghan police post. And something else, which many residents of Juz Ghoray had never seen before: an Afghan flag raised on a wooden pole.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/magazine/afghanistan.html

2012-02-01,Who’s Spending Unlimited Amounts of Money to Influence the U.S. Election,"Close to 60 corporations and wealthy individuals gave checks of $100,000 or more to a “super PAC” supporting Mitt Romney in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses, underwriting a $17 million advertising blitz that has swamped his Republican rivals in the early primary states. Filings to the Federal Election Commission offered the first detailed look at a crucial source of support for Mr. Romney and showed his ability to win substantial backing from a small number of his party’s most influential and wealthy patrons, each contributing to the super PAC far more than the $2,500 each could donate to his campaign. Fund-raising documents filed by President Obama showed the kind of financial juggernaut Mr. Romney will face if he becomes his party’s nominee: Mr. Obama reported raising a total of $140 million in 2011, far eclipsing the $57 million Mr. Romney raised for the year. The figures underscored the deep divide between how each party’s presidential contenders are financing their early bids for the White House: Mr. Obama exploiting the well-oiled machinery of an incumbent with a powerful grass-roots apparatus and hundreds of “bundlers” gathering checks of up to $2,500 per person from friends and associates, and his Republican opponents relying far more heavily on independent groups empowered by court decisions that have made it easier for wealthy individuals and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to intervene directly in election contests.

2012-02-01,’21 Jump Street’ Gets a Prime Premiere Spot,"LOS ANGELES — “21 Jump Street,” based on the ’80’s television series about back-to-high school cops, but now with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in lead roles, will have its premiere on March 12 at the South by Southwest festival, the organization announced in unveiling its feature film program on Wednesday. Janet Pierson, producer of the festival’s movie portion, noted “a kind of aggressiveness, a boldness, risk-taking” in 130 feature films that will screen between March 9 and March 17 in Austin, Tex. Ms. Pierson pointed, for example, to “Dollhouse,” an Irish film, from the writer-director Kirsten Sheridan, about five street kids who create havoc after breaking into a suburban Dublin home. Several documentaries in the program look at Los Angeles and the raucous past of its music culture. Those include “Sunset Strip,” about the history of that iconic portion of Sunset Boulevard, and “Uprising: Hip Hop & the L.A. Riots.” Celebrity figures in “$ellebrity,” a documentary by the star photographer Kevin Mazur, and in “Decoding Deepak,” also a documentary, in which Gotham Chopra examines his famous father, Deepak. The festival earlier announced that it would host the premiere of “The Cabin in the Woods,” a long-awaited horror film directed by Drew Goddard and written by Mr. Goddard and Joss Whedon. In all, programmers reviewed 1,957 feature-length submissions, including 1,387 from the United States, and 570 from abroad, the festival said.

2012-02-01,Coming Soon | Man Slippers,"Opera pumps, evening slippers, court shoes — all are fairly off-putting, emasculating names for the footwear that made its way down many runways during the recent men’s shows in Europe. A more user-friendly term might be evening slip-ons. Those prim, shiny black-patent shoes, traditionally finished with grosgrain ribbon and worn to the opera and other after-five affairs, have been transformed into red-carpet walkers ornately decorated with embroidery, tassels, metal studs, glitter and prints. Dries van Noten chose sleek brown pony and black astrakhan for his version. Almost every single pair of shoes that walked down the Etro runway was a slip-on that was either jacquarded, paisleyed, embroidered or feathered. Jimmy Choo’s hyper elegant and wildly expanding men’s line has so many varieties of their evening shoe, the Sloane, that is seems almost a wardrobe staple — leopard prints, studded stars and a house-designed “porno camo” are just some of what’s offered. Sarah Burton’s rich, dandified Alexander McQueen collection, with its Prince of Wales plaids, trompe l’oeil moiré and knickered suits, had an elegant evening outfit in black and white with a shoe embroidered with such large white roses they looked life-sized. Tom Ford, ever the night bird, has shown elegant evening shoes in his line from the get go: rich velvets ready for a monogram and extravagant brocades, some with slinky tassels. Perfect for a handsome Beverly Hills house husband. And Christian Louboutin, who presented his growing men’s line in Paris, added some more slip-ons in velvet with studded cap toes and a properly regal crest. Given the recent stateside popularity of the espadrille, and similar styles by Toms Shoes, the evening slip-on has big potential for a life outside the opera house.

As a federal prosecutor taking down gangsters and white-collar criminals, Giuliani won some dramatic battles, and after 9/11 he was widely praised for making the city feel under control. Like Coriolanus, he came across as a man of action. But he displayed open contempt for those who disagreed with him, and he dismissed the voices of many of his constituents. Shakespeare portrays the public as fickle, but it’s not unreasonable to admire some of a leader’s qualities while finding serious fault with others. Coriolanus is a great warrior, but he’s a terrible model for a civic leader. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/magazine/reply-all-riff-coriolanus.html

2012-02-03,The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius,"In an article on the runner Oscar Pistorius, Michael Sokolove examines the controversy over whether Pistorius is at an unfair advantage competing against other runners, given that he has no lower legs and uses carbon-fiber prostheses. One point raised by Peter Weyand, a biomechanics professor at Southern Methodist University, is that Pistorius’s prosthetic running legs are much lighter than real human legs would be for a man of his size. He gives the figure of 5.4 pounds for the prosthetic, compared with 12.6 pounds for a real human leg, and states that as a result, Pistorius can move his legs much quicker than those with real legs, and generate more speed. If this is the true point of contention, why not simply design a heavier running prosthetic, one that models the accurate weight of a human leg, and end the debate? Then there could be no claim that Pistorius was at an unfair advantage. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/magazine/reply-all-oscar-pistorious.html

And Richard might as well be a porcelain figurine — exquisite, immobile, infinitely fragile. If someone were to tap him with the scepter he holds, he would surely shatter.

Midway through, in a strangely haunting scene, a man and a woman are wandering the ruins of a drowned town: Nebraska’s own Atlantis, the man calls it. A reservoir that once flooded the place has dried up. Old buildings, now exposed, are washed out and ghostly, standing derelict amid silt and scrub grass. In both that novel and this new collection of stories, much of the world has that same quality of erosion and insubstantiality. Even the people seem hollowed out, teetering on the verge of collapse.

Although Jordan’s screen monsters are visible — he directed “Interview With the Vampire” and is now shooting “Byzantium,” about mother-daughter vampires — in this novel vampirism becomes the perfect metaphor for the story of two look-alike men who feed off each other’s souls all their crisscrossed lives.

Ausubel, who grew up in New Mexico, is several generations removed from Nazi-dominated Europe. She is not a despairing witness like Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel or Tadeusz Borowski, survivors of Auschwitz, Buchenwald and other camps whose work revealed the terrors of the Holocaust. She is closer in age to Jonathan Safran Foer, whose first novel, “Everything Is Illuminated,” follows a young American and his malaprop-prone guide on a journey to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Ausubel’s novel is concerned with family history, communal memory and the power of the imagination, and maintains an uncanny, sometimes troubling, aura of innocence throughout.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/no-one-is-here-except-all-of-us-ramona-ausubels-fablelike-novel.html

2012-02-03,After ‘Lunch’,"In 1959, as this collection begins, William S. Burroughs was living in Paris at 9, rue Git-le-Coeur, the address that would come to be known as “the Beat Hotel.” “Naked Lunch” had just been published by the Olympia Press; because of censorship it would not be published in the United States for another three years. He was collaborating with the British artist and writer Brion Gysin on a variety of experimental procedures. Gysin had just accidentally discovered the cut-up method, in which pages of different texts are cut into sections and combined and re­arranged to form new meanings. The two were also making tape-recorder mon­tages and tinkering with a stroboscopic device called the dream machine. Burroughs was then at the height of his literary activity, working on many of his most important books, from “The Soft Machine” to “The Wild Boys,” within the following few years. Consequently, “Rub Out the Words,” unlike its predecessor (“The Letters of William S. Burroughs, 1945-1959,” edited by Oliver Harris, 1993), is longer on argument than on incident.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/the-letters-william-s-burroughs-wrote-at-the-height-of-his-success.html

2012-02-03,Going to the Mats,"In “The Science of Yoga,” William J. Broad brings something unusual to his subject: an open mind. Broad, the book’s biographical note informs us, has practiced yoga since 1970. For nearly that long he has also been a science reporter for The New York Times, writing books like “Teller’s War: The Top-Secret Story Behind the Star Wars Deception” along the way. But Broad brings neither the boosterism of a yoga devotee nor the leeriness of a professional skeptic to his project — just curiosity, energy and a commitment to follow where his investigations lead. That route turns out to be a long and meandering one, ending up at an ambiguous, or at least ambivalent, conclusion. Though “The Science of Yoga” lacks the clarity of a book that sets out to define and defend a preconceived position, what it does offer is an intellectually honest exploration that is true to yoga’s own winding path.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/the-science-of-yoga-considers-the-practices-benefits.html

Fans of the Kennedy dynasty needn’t despair, though. One of the books replacing it is RoseMarie Terenzio’s “Fairy Tale Interrupted,” which enters the list at No. 8 and describes her years as John F. Kennedy Jr.’s executive assistant. The fairy tale her title refers to is “Cinderella”: Terenzio grew up in a working-class Bronx neighborhood, and her book is a classic “Bright Lights, Big City” story of a young striver making it in the glamorous world of celebrity and publishing (she met Kennedy just as his magazine, George, was starting up in 1994, and worked for him until his death in a 1999 plane crash). She didn’t like him at first. “I wasn’t immune to how handsome he was,” she told The Boston Globe recently, “but I was obsessed with Howard Stern.” Eventually, though, she grew to see Kennedy as a sort of big brother. “He’d come from behind and, like, stick gum in my hair,” she told The New York Observer in 2003. “He thought that sort of thing was really, really funny.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Three years ago, my husband and I bought a house built in 1906, located on the Hudson River in Northwest Yonkers. It’s a D.I.Y. project that we call home. We were doing some work in the basement, removing an old crumbling piece of plaster wall, when I pulled a few wadded bits of newspaper out of the wall. One piece just happened to be half an issue of The New York Times Magazine from May 1937. From before Europe was engulfed in war, completely intact (aside from the missing bottom half), and a great find that I brought in to work for show and tell.

First, it’ll be a close game. Second, one of the two teams is likely to have kicked a field goal at some point to get its final lead. Or third, if one team is trailing toward the end of the fourth quarter, it might well get a chance to kick a field goal to tie or win the game. Lastly, and this, really, is the red zone I’m driving toward: Everything will probably just come down to, in Peyton Manning’s memorable words, an “idiot kicker.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/super-bowl-xlvi-will-the-kickers-decide/

The Graham piece is inspired by Ariadne and the Minotaur and is a riff on sexual self-awareness. Vishneva is flat-footed throughout and wears a floaty, quite lyrical dress — a far cry from her usual tutus — a design done for the original Graham production. “In classical roles you don’t have the freedom to express deep inner emotions the way I do now,” says the 35-year-old, conceding that she could never have taken on the part as a young girl. “Even in Ariadne’s weakness, the role of the maid, she is still strong and powerful.” For the other two works, “Dialogue” by John Neumeier and “Subject to Change” by Paul Lightfoot and Sol León, she dances in a maroon housedress-like leotard and white Victorian blouson and briefs, respectively. Asked how this new program and new look have been received thus far in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she said cutely: “Taking the roof off.” Vishneva and crew arrive at New York City Center on March 14.

The admission came as two judges at the High Court in London were hearing evidence in a lawsuit brought by a former deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and a group of other litigants. Top officers at Scotland Yard have previously rejected allegations that they tried to quash a wide-ranging inquiry into the hacking as part of a cozy relationship with the British newspaper subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, owner of the now-defunct News of the World. At the High Court, Scotland Yard lawyers said the failure to investigate more thoroughly resulted from the pressure the police were under to investigate terrorism threats.

An e-mail petition for a pardon for Mr. Turing, who committed suicide by eating a cyanide-laced apple in 1954, when he was 41, has drawn worldwide support from scientists and others. But Tom McNally, a minister of state for justice, told the House of Lords that the Cameron government stood by the decision of previous governments not to grant a pardon for Mr. Turing’s conviction for gross indecency. Mr. McNally noted that the former prime minister, Gordon Brown, had issued “an unequivocal a posthumous apology” to Mr. Turing in 2009, but he said that Mr. Turing “would have known” that he was committing an offense under the law as it stood at the time.

2012-02-09,Spain: Judge Speaks at His Trial," Baltasar Garzón, a high-profile Spanish judge, told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that his decision to investigate killings committed during the Spanish Civil War had been motivated by “the helplessness of the victims.” With arguments finished, the Supreme Court would normally be expected to rule within about 20 days, although no deadline has been set. If found guilty, Mr. Garzón, 56, could be suspended as a judge for as long as 20 years, a sanction that would effectively end his career. His 2008 attempt to investigate killings from the Spanish Civil War was brought to a swift end because of the political controversy that it set off. But right-wing groups started legal action against him, charging that he had overreached his authority and knowingly contravened a 1977 general amnesty that covers crimes perpetrated during the war.

Among his conquests: a spork and a Rubik’s Cube. “There’s never been a puzzle quite like Rubik’s Cube, and America may never be the same,” announced the Ideal Toy Corporation in an early 1980s commercial. It wasn’t wrong. While teaching a class called Form Studies in the early 1970s, the Hungarian architect Erno Rubik had his students slice a large cube of foam horizontally and vertically. He quickly realized that you could rotate the top half relative to the bottom half, the puzzle expert Jerry Slocum says. “And that’s where the idea of the Rubik’s Cube came from.” In 1975, Rubik patented it under the name Magic Cube and pitched toy executives on the notion that something that forced players to exert extraordinary mental energy was loads of fun. In 1977, it entered the Budapest marketplace. Three years later, it came to the U. S. as Rubik’s Cube.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/rubiks-cube.html

2012-02-10,‘Stick Fly’ to Close at the Cort This Month,"“Stick Fly,” the Broadway play about an emotionally stormy weekend at the vacation home of an African-American family, will close on Feb. 26 after 24 preview performances and 92 regular performances over about three months, the producers announced on Thursday. The play, by Lydia R. Diamond, will end its run at the Cort Theater at a financial loss for the play’s producers, who include the pop-R&B singer Alicia Keys (she also composed music for the show). Ticket sales were modest throughout the run of “Stick Fly,” which opened on Dec. 8 to mixed reviews from critics; the production has grossed a total of $3.25 million. The capitalization for mounting the show had not been disclosed; most Broadway plays cost between $2 million and $3 million, plus weekly operating expenses. Philip J. Smith, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Cort Theater, said that he expected another show to open at the theater before April 26, the cut-off date for eligibility for the 2012 Tony Awards. “Stick Fly” is directed by Kenny Leon (“Fences”) and stars Dulé Hill, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Rosie Benton, and Condola Rashad, whose performance has been singled out for praise by many critics.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/stick-fly-to-close-at-the-cort-this-month/

Bearded mountain men in distressed shearlings and bright plaid and American Indian-inspired flannels with jeans and khakis tucked into boots looked perfectly at home in a roughly hewn mountain cabin. Across the way, an ersatz university club housed nattily suited gents in soft-shouldered tweed sack suits, all from the Polo Ralph Lauren line. Past a glass and steel ski lodge with a million-dollar mountain view, we got a look at the new Black Label Denim collection, in its second season now. The denim- and leather-heavy line had two distinct vibes: one à la “The Aviator,” with a coated cotton bomber jacket, sleek knits and double breasted coats in olive and brown. The other, very Brando in “The Wild One,” was heavy on the leather with moto-inspired ribbed knits, short zipped jackets and slim utility jeans. My favorite look from this bunch was a short belted black leather jacket with asymmetrical zippers and intricately padded shoulders, shown with a front pant and biker boots.

Tibetan independence advocates said Thursday that a monk in Chenduo County, in Qinghai Province, set himself on fire on Wednesday to protest Chinese rule. Free Tibet, a London-based group, said the monk, in his 30s, was alive but in serious condition. More than 20 Tibetans, most of them monks or former monks, have died from self-immolations in the past three years, protesting what they say is China’s repression of Tibetan culture and religion. The state-run Tibet Daily said Thursday that Tibet’s Communist Party secretary had dismissed three subordinates for failing to crack down on a recent wave of Tibetan unrest, which China says was caused by subversion by disciples of the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader in exile.

John Wilkes Booth, the actor turned assassin, was also imagined, leaping onto the stage, injuring his foot, theatrically proclaiming triumph over tyranny and racing into the alley, where a getaway horse waited.

2012-02-10,Backstage Beauty Report | BCBG,"“The ponytail appears every season, doesn’t it?” asked the hairstylist Neil Moodie backstage at BCBG, explaining why he decided to do a new take on the classic. Moodie’s version was a low ponytail with a disheveled “post-sex bang,” created using Bumble and Bumble Prep spray before blow-drying and securing the hair, and wrapping a piece low over the eyes. He recommended Spray de Mode to be sure these bangs are “light and airy,” to compliment the ’40s-style color-blocked clothes. Charlotte Willer, a makeup artist, chose to channel the graphic looks with Maybelline Eye Studio Gel Eyeliner drawn from the inner corner of the eye up and away onto the skin. She avoided what she called “just pretty” ’60s cat eyes by leaving space between the line and the lid. There was no mascara and brows were simply groomed. Dream Bouncy cheek color in copper was applied along cheekbones with Baby Lips lip balm.

In “Pink Smog: Becoming Weetzie Bat,” nearly everything about Weetzie changes — except for her love of these two things. In fact, these two bedrocks become inextricably linked as Weetzie learns to use Los Angeles and the lessons it has taught her to cope with her father’s departure. Charlie’s absence would be difficult enough on its own, but Weetzie also has to deal with a new school, an alcoholic mother, the first flutter of adolescent attraction, a boy who may be either an angel or a surfer, and a next-door neighbor who is either a witch with a passion for voodoo or a psychotic girl with a hateful agenda and a pair of chow chows.

If true, it’s the kind of sad irony that would have been appreciated by Taylor, who over the course of 12 novels and dozens of short stories written between 1943 and her death in 1975 returned repeatedly to the subject of women forced to be wives and mothers first and only then, if at all, writers, artists or simply human beings.

It was a good sort of name to have in the early days of American filmmaking, when he got his start, as a director of cheap, fast silent westerns — a time when making movies was a daredevil, seat-of-the-pants activity, best suited to those who were arrogant enough to believe that they could control the complicated machines they put in motion, and crazy enough not to care if they crashed and burned.

That, of course, leaves a $24 billion trade deficit. Currencies work like any other salable good in that they adjust based on supply and demand. The natural result should be for the dollar to get weaker as the renminbi gets stronger.” Not so. Just as foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to spend on American exports, foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to invest in America. Because a rising U.S. trade deficit often signals increased foreign demand to invest in America, it’s a mistake to suppose that dollars that foreigners don’t spend on American exports necessarily are dollars not demanded by foreigners for use in America. In short, a rising U.S. trade deficit does not necessarily unleash market forces that weaken the dollar against other currencies.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/reply-all-economy.html

In this, our second annual Voyages Issue, we accompany John Jeremiah Sullivan as he returns to the Ireland he knew as a student, just before the country’s economic boom, to find in the newly empty spaces of a post-bust country a metaphor for Irish loss. Next, we follow Sam Anderson as he traces Dickens’s footsteps, in the towns where he grew up and set his novels and in the theme park erected outside London in his name, an amusement manufactured for flush times rendered strangely Dickensian by circumstance. In Istanbul, Suzy Hansen maps the city’s flourishing art scene and its fragile cosmopolitanism. Charles Wilson reminds us that the reasons we travel are often idiosyncratic, whether we’re running seven marathons on seven continents or paying a visit to Jesus’ tomb in Japan. And finally, the most transporting journeys are frequently those closest to home.

2012-02-10,My Debt to Ireland,"Ireland starts for me with the end of “The Dead,” which my father read to me from his desk in his basement office in New Albany, Ind. I don’t remember what age I was — feels like it could have happened anytime between the 6th and 11th birthdays — but I picture the scene with a strange, time-slurred clarity of detail. His offices were always in the basement, because that’s where he could smoke his endless, extra-long menthols, exhaling nasally over the red mustache. I can smell it in his sweat when he bends down to kiss me goodbye, and I smell it in this room. I also note cat urine, because our vicious, lonely old calico, Skipper, tends to relieve herself on the dark green chair in the corner when stressed, and the scent has soaked into the stuffing, and my father won’t throw away the chair, because it belonged to his father. The mottled surface of the desk where he writes is dark green, almost black, and glowing green are the little letters on the screen of the primitive Tandy word processor the newspaper has given him, and an excellent forest green is the cover of “The Portable James Joyce,” my mother’s Penguin paperback from college. He’s holding it close to his face. He was blind in one eye and couldn’t see especially well out of the other, wore dark-framed, vaguely government-issue glasses, but they’re lowered, he’s turning his head and squinting over the top of them. He reads me the famous last paragraph, “The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. . . .” Nothing of the actual language remained with me, except, years later, reading the story at school, there was something like déjà vu at the part where Joyce first says the snow was “falling faintly,” then four words later says it was, “faintly falling.” The slight overconspicuousness of that had stuck, as I suppose he intended.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/john-jeremiah-sullivan-ireland.html

When I moved to the neighborhood five years ago, it was all electrical-supply stores and abandoned buildings and men smoking.

2012-02-13,Darwin’s Papers Show the Evolution of His Ideas,"Just in time for Charles Darwin’s 203rd birthday on Sunday, the American Museum of Natural History is unveiling the first phase of its online Darwin Manuscripts Project, a collection of more than 15,000 digitized manuscript pages and thousands of other documents drawn from Cambridge University Library, the Biodiversity Heritage Library and other institutions around the world. Among the documents available on the Web site are notes from Darwin’s time aboard the HMS Beagle, pocket diaries, early drafts of works like “The Origin of Species” (viewable with and without Darwin’s revisions), and previously unpublished manuscripts like an “experiment book” describing Darwin’s original research on plant breeding strategies, begun in 1856. In addition to revealing Darwin’s intellectual evolution, the project also reveals Darwin’s sometimes less-than-careful treatment of some of his own papers. Today, a first-edition of the “Origin” is a highly sought after rare book, but pages of the original manuscript are even rarer, thanks to Darwin’s habit of passing them out as scrap paper. Among the 42 full pages known to survive today, a few feature fanciful drawings on the reverse by his son Francis showing birds undreamed of in the Galápagos Islands as well as a soldier on a carrot battling a cavalier on an eggplant.

What’s different about Murray’s analysis is that his villain — largely implicit in the book, but a central presence nonetheless — is the cultural revolution of the 1970s and the consequent relaxation of traditional social restraints, like the disapproval of child-bearing out of wedlock.",World,https://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/what-to-read-now-meditations-on-a-world-divided/

Back inside, Joseph Altuzarra walks by without pause. Pecheux and Hanlon have everything under control. Hanlon’s busy creating what he calls “skinny hair,” inspired by the unwashed, matted strands spotted on one of the stylist’s assistants. ‘It had that few-days-old look,” said Hanlon, explaining why he wanted the crown to appear as if the girl had been wearing a hat. For those with thicker hair, Hanlon braided lower portions and pinned them close to the head or used a yellow net cap to press tresses down. Fekkai Coiff Anti-Frizz Silkening Crème with Coiff Oceanique Touseled Wave Spray was used all over to help hold the roughed-up strands.

2012-02-13,Backstage Beauty Report | Derek Lam,"“I’ve got you, Daphne,” one of Tom Pecheux’s assistants said as he led Daphne Groeneveld to a seat at the end of a long table backstage at Derek Lam. Her hair was teased, and she was wearing a black sweater sewn with pearls. Someone brought by an orange and red embroidered dickey collar and asked her if she would mind slipping it on before makeup. Pecheux’s team was about to turn her into his version of a naughty schoolgirl using a soft veil of Estée Lauder‘s new Invisible Fluid Makeup, concealer and powder. Eyebrows were groomed and lashes coated with Sumptuous Two Tone Eye-Opening Mascara to apply black on the top and brown on the bottom. Eyes were lined and spread with smoky burgundy and then a sweep of Sugar Cube white — the same shadow that was dotted in the middle of the lips, and covered in Crystal Pink and Vanilla Truffle lipstick. “A lovely girly lip color,” is how Pecheux described the effect. He wanted the girls’ mouths to look innocent, just as their eyes were lined to make them appear more youthful — rounder — rather than sultry. The hairstylist Orlando Pita channeled the same lady. “She’s well bred, a little bit intellectual, eccentric, twisted,” he said of his muse spending a semester at an all-girls school. This translated in to hair blow-dried with Phyto Volumizing Mousse and the T3 Featherweight Luxe, back-combed, curled with the T3 SinglePass Whirl and pinned up for daytime, with loose strands let down at the back come night.

The officers did not write with the explicit purpose of countering Lt. Col. Davis, but merely to document their observations on the progress and pitfalls of training Afghan security forces in one very unsettled province.

2012-02-13,Divide and Conquer,"So far as I can tell, the White House’s proposed “compromise” in the contraception-sterilization-plan B-ella controversy asks the parties involved to compromise their reasoning faculties and play a game of “let’s pretend” instead. The revised regulation allows religious institutions to pretend that they aren’t actually purchasing an insurance plan that covers services they find morally objectionable, because their insurance companies will be required to pretend that they’re supplying these services free of charge. But fond illusions about “free” services aside, it’s hard to see how a system in which Catholic hospitals and colleges are required to purchase health insurance for their employees from insurers that are required to cover birth control, sterilizations and the morning- and days-after pills is meaningfully different from the original Health and Human Services mandate. As Yuval Levin writes, “the choice for religious employers is still between paying an insurer to provide their workers with access to a product that violates their convictions or paying a fine to the government.” The rule has been changed, but the reality remains the same.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/divide-and-conquer/

Her secret? Farming her grapes biodynamically. To avoid manipulation of the harvest with chemical products, the grapes must be their healthiest, she explains, and this requires especially attentive work in the vineyards. The payoff is a fuller expression of the terroir, and of the various grapes. “Each one,” she says, “has something to communicate.” Go to interactive feature >>",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/edible-selby-natural-woman/

He explicated the insidious ways in which the upper echelons of Greek media were intertwined with the political structure, which prevented reporting of financial mismanagement and also clouded any hope for resolving the crisis. And he noted little things, like the leaflets on car windshields advertising moving companies: literal signs of the way the economic crisis was affecting Athens, as people angled for escape routes, either abroad or to the countryside. And how the mayor’s office was at that moment considering a quaint but cockeyed approach for the season’s Christmas lighting scheme: stringing lights around the city’s hundreds of shuttered storefronts.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/the-way-greeks-live-now.html

Both Ms. Buckley and Linzi Hateley, who played Carrie, lay on the stage in the dark, hearing the boos; Ms. Buckley recalled that Ms. Hateley, making her Broadway debut, whispered, “What do we do?”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/betty-buckley-weighs-in-on-new-carrie-musical/

It was around 1984 at Sweetwater’s, a defunct Manhattan nightclub located on 68th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. My future husband and I went to the club to hear her mother, Cissy, perform, because I was loving a gospel album that she released a few years earlier. But as it turned out, Cissy was using her show as an opportunity to introduce Whitney, who at the time appeared as a backup singer in her mother’s show along with her brother Gary. I remember this beautiful, skinny, confident, 21-year-old girl-child coming to the microphone that night and silencing all of us in the middle of our conversations, our drinks, our meals as she “toe up” “I Am Changing,” from the Broadway show “Dreamgirls.” I wish I could say that I walked out thinking, That child is going to be a star, but as special as I knew her voice to be, I had no inkling of what was to come.

To channel Ervell’s vision of contrasts, the hairstylist Holli Smith played with juxtaposing textures and lots of different sprays: “There’s a frizzy, dry feel on top, with strokes of shine below, right around the edges.” After amplifying volume with Oribe Maximista Thickening Hair Spray, Smith spritzed Oribe Soft Lacquer Hair Spray to the top of the head, and went in with a curling iron. The newly-created waves were then dulled down with the help of Oribe Dry Texturizing Hair Spray. To keep the bottom and sides looking glossy, Smith layered on generous amounts of Oribe Superfine Strong Hair Spray. Continuing the theme of opposites, the makeup artist Maki Ryoke said, “I’m keeping the T-zone very matte, but highlighting the cheekbones for an almost 3-D effect.” Skin was cleaned with Bioderma Crealine, then lightly moisturized with Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, both of which are fashion-world cult favorites. Ryoke proceeded by correcting complexions with Bobbi Brown concealers and hydrating lips with Australian Lucas’ Papaw Ointment. Final steps included muting mouths with a thin veil of concealer “to make the whole face appear more uniform” and patting more Embryolisse high on the cheeks, for a quiet, subtle glow.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/backstage-grooming-report-patrik-ervell/

He has made a couple of populist statements, promising to limit the traffic privileges of officials and to remedy the mess President Dmitri Medvedev created by abolishing daylight savings time. He has blanketed Russian cities with bland billboards (“Together toward a great Russia” is the tagline). But most important, he has released a list of 499 people — the number is inexplicable — who are empowered to campaign on his behalf.

2012-02-14,Backstage Beauty Report | Carolina Herrera,"Backstage at Carolina Herrera, the stylist Tabitha Simmons, dressed in a leopard coat, black pants and booties, was sitting on one of the makeup stools talking with Diane Kendal before all the models rolled in. Across the way, in the hair department (the two are at separate Lincoln Center studios, with racks of clothes in between), Joan Smalls sat underneath Orlando Pita and one of his hair-dryer-wielding assistants as Pita prepped her hair for what he described as “teasing, hairspray, teasing and more hairspray.” For Smalls, he said he didn’t need any product aside from Moroccan Oil Luminous Hairspray to build up the crown. “The less we stress the hair, the better,” he said, explaining that he’d give Smalls a bottle of Moroccan Oil treatment “to use on her 10 minutes off.” Each model was wearing a curious black loop around her neck, which turned out to be a headband that would crown the teased up hair when done. Some girls would also have the ends pulled back and secured with a black bow. It was statement hair for Herrera, which meant Kendal wanted subtle makeup. Back to the other side, where she was using M.A.C. Sculpt contouring powder and Tenderling blush on cheeks, Taupe eyeshadow on lids and Black Cremestick Liner applied superclose to the lash line with a little brush. “It’s a beautiful, soft effect, without looking too normal,” she said of the liner bleeding in between the lashes as a substitute for mascara. There was no lipstick; instead, lips were tinged with Spice lip pencil. “We’re enhancing without laying down color,” Kendal said. “On the runway the girls look beautiful, but you can’t see what’s been done.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/backstage-beauty-report-carolina-herrera/

2012-02-14,Backstage Beauty Report | Marc Jacobs,"“I’m just the supporting act today,” said Guido Palau backstage at Marc Jacobs as his team tied models’ hair into braids, with wisps left loose “like mesh floating in front of the face.” The braids would be hidden under hats when the girls hit the runway, but still Palau wanted them perfect, citing Jacobs’s directive. A healthy shot of Redken Forceful 23 Super Strength Finishing Spray made sure everything stayed that way. Palau likened the labor-intensive look to his careful braids at Alexander McQueen last season, which ended up concealed beneath lace hoods. In contrast, makeup meant heavy brows created by François Nars with Bali Single Eyeshadow to frame lids covered in Pandora Eyeshadow Duo and smudged with Black Moon Eyeliner in homage to the illustrious Marchesa Casati. Mascara was layered on both the top and bottom lashes, while skin was left dewy and bare. Nars explained that the eyes were paramount as each model — blonde, brunette or redhead — wouldn’t be defined by their covered-up hair. He called the overall effect “very dreamy — a little sad in a way.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/backstage-beauty-report-marc-jacobs/

It’s the first Manhattan restaurant that specializes in the region. “Yunnan is a melting pot,” said Jeffrey Lim, a partner. “Our version is modernized.” He said that unlike other parts of China, Yunnan uses fresh herbs, like basil and mint. Among the appetizers are a salad of spicy chrysanthemum and greens, and another of banana blossoms, which are frequently used in Thai cooking, and mango. Lemongrass seasons baby back ribs and sea bass, and a dish of tiger prawns is stir-fried with Chinese candied olives. Yunnan traditions include a steam pot chicken, fried rice with ground pork and pickled turnips, and two noodle dishes made with layered ingredients, called Cross-Bridge noodles for a story about how they were created. The chef, Kian Lam Kho, is from Singapore and Mr. Lim said his specialty was homestyle cooking. The name, Lotus Blue, refers to an elevated state of mind in Buddhism.

This throwback is an efficient device for making pressed grilled sandwiches that some people may remember from decades ago, just as Janice Feigenbaum and her sister, Susan Caldwell, do. They grew up in the Chicago area eating sandwiches made with the gadget, whose brief life ran from 1945 to 1953. Recently, they learned that the company had gone out of business and that the patent had expired, but after buying a Toas-Tite on eBay, they “reverse engineered” it to figure out how to make it again. They now have the contraption made in China, and have trademarked it and reproduced the original packaging. Lightly grease the domelike cast-aluminum forms, place a slice of bread in each, add a filling, close the device and place it on a burner or grill for a minute or so. Turn it over, and in another minute you have a toasted sandwich. It demands cheese. Vintage Toas-Tites cost as much as $95 on eBay, so the replica is a relative bargain.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/dining/the-return-of-the-toas-tite-for-pressed-grilled-sandwiches.html

The bill, one of the most contentious of the legislative session, prompted the Senate president to remove one Republican, Mike Fasano, an outspoken opponent of privatization, as chairman of the Senate budget subcommittee on public safety earlier this year.

Madly Blush was also used and the lips coated in the coral Bolero. “They love makeup,” said Kaliardos of the Mulleavy sisters. “And they love beauty.” Across from the newly tanned Wixson, there was a near empty jar of Nutella, or some American equivalent of the hazelnut paste, and a spread of pastries picked over by models, their nails painted Deborah Lippman’s bronze No More Drama with a matte top coat. On the other side of the room, Odile Gilbert lifted her hands to make a “peekaboo” gesture as she explained how her face-framing hair made the girls look like “little dolls.” To create this bob effect, she used Kerastase Nectar Thermique to prep the hair before braiding it and tucking it up underneath. The right side was then set in waves using a three barrel or one-inch iron with Resistance Mousse Volumactive and Double Force hairspray. The bend was then pinned with a headpiece of falling gold stars. “There were two words from the sisters,” said Gilbert of their clear directive: “Outback.

2012-02-15,Backstage Beauty Report | Sophie Theallet,"“I’m so mad about her mix of colors,” said Tom Pecheux of the designer Sophie Theallet backstage at her show. So, he decided to go a little wild too. Eyes were lined with M.A.C.’s dark plum Sketch to fade into black Carbon. Instead of shadow, Dirty Plum and Full Fuchsia blushes were used as shadow all over the lid. This strong, smoky eye was finished off with mascara, brushed brows, matte skin and a new nude peach lipstick. Pecheux explained the back story imagined for the collection, describing the intricate eye as the result of a fallen starlet’s sleight of hand learned during her celebrity heyday. She may have no money, but she knows how to do her makeup. In contrast, he explained, dong one’s own hair can be harder, which is why Didier Malige created a roughed-up ponytail. He used Aveda Volumizing Tonic to dampen hair, blow-dry and then finger rake it into a center part with a teased crown. Pure Abundance Hair Potion, a powder to liquid, was then applied as the hair was pulled back with a strand to cover the elastic set with Air Control Hairspray. “She’s a very rich girl who lives in a castle and suddenly has no more money,” Malige said. “But she still buys clothes.

2012-02-15,Crime and the Social Crisis,"Anyone interested in the subject of mass incarceration would do well to read Adam Gopnik’s justly-praised New Yorker essay back-to-back with with Christopher Glazek’s n+1 piece on the same subject, which comes with the provocative (and then some) title “Raise the Crime Rate.” The two essays overlap in many ways, but they ultimately make an interesting contrast: Gopnik is a liberal whose moral outrage at our prison system’s cruelties coexists with a confidence that better policy can keep crime rates low without locking so many people up; Glazek is a radical who insists that “the [U.S.] prison system doesn’t need reform—it needs to be abolished,” and flatly states that “you cannot relieve the suffering of the prison population without increasing safety risks for the rest of us.” This radicalism leads him to distinctive — and, indeed, one might even say conservative — conclusions: He argues, for instance, that pro-gun control progressives should be willing to live with a heavily-armed population in order to make Americans feel safe enough to countenance emptying our prisons, and he has a skepticism about the consequences of the anti-death penalty movement that overlaps substantially with my own views. Like Reihan Salam I wouldn’t endorse many of Glazek’s more sweeping claims, but he makes important points that both liberal and conservative reformers need to reckon with — and he’s almost certainly right any real prison reform effort is likely to prove much more wrenching than the optimism of policy wonks would sometimes lead one to expect.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/crime-and-the-social-crisis/

Though Varley O’Connor’s “The Master’s Muse” (Scribner), due out in May, bills itself as “a novel,” it is about her life, the title refers to her, and the cover features a photo of her. The truth is, this isn’t a novel, it’s a “novelization” — the difference being that writers of novelizations (let’s preserve the distinction and call them novelizers) choose for their main characters real, usually famous, people, then put words in their mouths and thoughts in their heads. Ann Beattie’s “Mrs. Nixon: A Novelist Imagines a Life” and Curtis Sittenfeld’s “American Wife: A Novel,” about Laura Bush, are the most conspicuous recent additions to the shelf. This is a genre custom-made for a culture fixated on celebrity.

Started in 2001, the category was intended to highlight a new form of cinema, when digital animation was new. In the years since, of course, the genre has become not only a success, but a blockbuster success: many of the highest-grossing films each year are animated. And now that several animated films have cracked the best picture list – including “Up” and “Toy Story 3” – animation “should no longer be accorded what amounts to a consolation prize,” Mr. Harris writes, adding: “A separate award feels redundant in a great year — and worse than that in an off year.” (There is also the muddle of how to deal with motion-capture animation and the relatively small pool of qualifying films – only 18 this year.)",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/eliminate-an-animation-category-guillermo-del-toro-might-object/

For those with thicker locks, he braided a layer against the head before twisting the rest with his hands and setting the ends with Fekkai Ultra Light Finishing Creme. He wanted to let the girls’ personalities come through, let their hair relax after a long week. He chalked up the success of the concept to the designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez’s stellar casting. Like Kendal, he felt the boys were “bringing it back to what they’re all about.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/backstage-beauty-report-proenza-schouler/

The cost was the destruction of a pristine valley that the naturalist John Muir once called “one of nature’s rarest and most precious mountain temples.” The project, completed in 1923 despite a national outcry, included a sweetheart deal for San Francisco: the right to buy the water for $30,000 a year. There have been many attempts to re-examine this deal and study whether the dam could be breached, the reservoir emptied and the valley restored. In the latest, Representative Dan Lungren, a Republican from California, has asked Ken Salazar, secretary of the interior, to investigate whether San Francisco is fulfilling its end of the deal, which requires the city to use all its local water sources before turning to Hetch Hetchy.

2012-02-17,Safe at Home,"On a blustery weekend afternoon, I am sitting in the living room of Lara Logan’s house in a leafy neighborhood in Washington, D.C., waiting for the CBS reporter to come home from the office. From my perch on a leather sectional sofa, I can see a plastic children’s fort in the garden; hear the creak of the front porch swing; marvel at the length of wooden train track snaking across the floor; peruse a guide to world armies; sip a cup of Nescafé with Coffee-mate. Also anticipating Logan’s arrival are her husband, Joseph Burkett, a work-at-home Congressional liaison, who is doing what all work-at-home dads do, i.e. strategically skirting past areas populated by children; Joseph and Lola, ages 3 and nearly 2, in pj’s and pacifiers, just up from their naps and on the prowl for snacks; and Ruby, the nanny, installed at the kitchen table from which she can attend to everyone’s needs with minimal motion. Logan, a “60 Minutes” correspondent, is now 90 minutes late, but one gets the sense from Burkett’s periodic updates (“she’s just been held up, leaving soon”) that a long office stint on a weekend is not out of the ordinary. When she eventually arrives — in flat boots and skinny fleece, looking freckled, tousled, sporty — she is greeted by the siege on Mommy, an attack of love and neediness all working mothers know too well. “I don’t think about career ambition,” she tells me later. “I don’t think about access.

2012-02-17,Two-Part Harmony,"By Charlie Louvin’s own account, people who saw the Louvin Brothers perform were mystified by the experience. Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother, played the mandolin like Bill Monroe and sang in an impossibly high, tense, quivering tenor. Charlie strummed a guitar, grinned like a vaudevillian and handled the bottom register. But every so often, in the middle of a song, some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places — with Ira swooping down from the heights, and Charlie angling upward — and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead. This was more than close-harmony singing; each instance was an act of transubstantiation. “It baffled a lot of people,” Charlie Louvin explains in his crackling new memoir. “We could change in the middle of a word. Part of the reason we could do that was that we’d learned to have a good ear for other people’s voices when we sang Sacred Harp. But the other part is that we were brothers.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/satan-is-real-the-story-of-the-louvin-brothers.html
2012-02-17,"Next Time, Try ‘Unflagging’","It started with the jacket copy for the British hardback of Richard Holmes’s wonderful “Age of Wonder.” We learn there of the astronomer William Herschel’s “tireless dedication to the stars” (the actual stars, that is, the ones out there in space, before they were superseded — and possibly even outnumbered — by those in the realm of film, pop and sport). This connection between an adjective and the stars made me curious about the extent to which a word can continue to shine after the life has gone out of it. Thereafter I started to notice that “tireless” and “tirelessly” were cropping up all over the place, often in works of considerable literary merit. In Jonathan Coe’s biography of the experimental novelist, for example, I read that B. S. Johnson “worked tirelessly for the trade union movement.” There was nothing particularly wrong with this particular instance, but the cumulative effect of encountering tirelesslys made me — taking my cue from Holmes again — wonder. Like a tired person trying to get to sleep who is kept awake by sounds from the street that he or she has for years scarcely noticed, I found that the word had become suddenly unignorable.

On nearly every page, there is a scene that feels as if it could have taken place during the Bush and Obama administrations rather than those of McKinley and Roosevelt. American troops are greeted on foreign soil as saviors and then quickly despised as occupiers. The United States triumphantly declares a victorious end to the war, even as bitter fighting continues.

2012-02-17,The First Marriage,"When the Republican Scott Brown defeated the Democrat Martha Coakley to win Edward M. Kennedy’s Senate seat in 2010, Michelle Obama was apoplectic. There was no major player in American politics whom Mrs. Obama treasured more than Ted Kennedy. For most of her adult life, wherever he stood on public policy issues, she pretty much stood. The first lady ardently believed that Kennedy’s endorsement of her husband for the 2008 Democratic nomination had been a real act of courage, the straw that tipped the scales in his favor against Hillary Clinton. Recognizing Brown’s surprise win as a threat to her husband’s entire health care initiative (the election cost Senate Democrats their super­majority), Mrs. Obama went scalp hunting. She blamed senior White House officials like Rahm Emanuel, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs for the Massachusetts disaster — and her husband for not riding herd on them. “She feels,” President Obama sheepishly told aides, “as if our rudder isn’t set right.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/the-obamas-by-jodi-kantor.html

Or his cook. Or the girl who dusts the grates. Or the farmer down the road. For a man of equanimity, Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham and lord of Downton Abbey, is surprisingly prone to fits of temper — nothing sparks his ire like an injustice done to a social inferior in his employ. You half-expect him to tear off his dinner jacket and reveal a spandex unitard as he rushes to succor an admiring serf. When a young woman accuses his footman of cowardice, the master leaps to the man’s defense, chin quivering in righteous indignation. When his shellshocked interim valet tells him people look at him and wonder why he’s not in uniform, the master bellows, “You refer them to me and I’ll give them a piece of my mind!” Earlier, when Bates, his original, beloved valet, resigned without an explanation, the master reacted like a spurned lover, hurling threats and vitriol, only to collapse in a puddle of remorse and apologize for the “low shot. ” He blames himself.

Armed with hook-shaped knives, Barrett and his party hack away at a grove of bare, shrublike trees called kozo, a Japanese relative of the common mulberry. At his nearby studio, which is housed in the former sanitarium’s laundry facility, the bundles of cut kozo are steamed in a steel caldron to loosen the bark. After the bark is stripped from the kozo, it is hung on racks, where it shrivels to a crisp over a matter of days. Eventually the bark is rehydrated and sliced apart from its middle, “green” layer, and that layer, in turn, is sheared from the prized inner layer. It takes about a hundred pounds of harvested kozo trees to yield eight pounds of this “white bark,” from which Barrett will ultimately make a few hundred sheets of what connoisseurs consider to be some of the world’s most perfect paper.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/timothy-barrett-papermaker.html

It was 56 years ago and I, as a 23-year-old Army lieutenant, experienced the same bleak landscape in Korea. We were making camp on a training mission to set up an emergency medical station about six miles from the DMZ. A private in my platoon uncovered a Marine dog tag when digging to anchor a field hospital tent on a deserted hilltop, identified only by its height in meters. We dug a wide swath and found nothing else and turned in the tag to quartermaster graves registration the next day. Holding that tag in my hands that evening and imagining that young people gave up their lives for an uninhabited, inhospitable hilltop in the middle of nowhere made me profoundly sad.

2012-02-17,Who Made That Artificial Snow?,"Before humans conquered snowmaking, ski resorts relied on the vagaries of Old Man Winter. He was not always forthcoming. So in the dry Connecticut chill of 1949-1950, Walter Schoenknecht, the owner of the Mohawk Mountain ski resort, took matters into his own hands. “He trucked in 700 tons of ice,” recalled Arthur Hunt, a forefather of artificial snow, in a retrospective in Ski Area Management magazine. Schoenknecht subsequently “had it chopped up and spread over a single slope.” It was the first known use of fake snow on a ski slope. It also helped spark an idea. One Monday that March, Hunt’s colleague Wayne Pierce came up with a shrewder plan. He figured that a drop of water, propelled through below-freezing air, would turn into a snowflake, Hunt recalled. Along with Dave Richey, their partner in a ski factory, they slapped together a spray-gun nozzle, a 10-horsepower compressor and a garden hose into something of a D.I.Y. snow gun. They experimented with it all night. “By morning,” Hunt wrote, “we had a 20-inch pile of snow over a diameter of 20 feet.” The contraption was later used at Mohawk Mountain.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/who-made-that-artificial-snow.html

But Max is 36 now, and he told Forbes magazine last month that the hard-drinking, hard-partying lifestyle he writes about doesn’t really, you know, fulfill him anymore. So he’s started seeing a Freudian analyst four times a week. “So many people describe my books as just pure id,” he said. “What I’m trying to do now is to connect my ego and my superego to my id. I’m trying to understand, why was I doing all this stuff? Why was I acting this way? Through understanding all of that, you start to resolve the underlying problems that you’re acting out, in a healthier, more productive way.” He’s taken up yoga, and instead of beer he stocks his fridge with a beverage they undoubtedly do serve in hell — the trendy organic health drink kombucha. Most of all, he said, he wants his readers to know that laddish fame doesn’t offer a path to true happiness. “I’ve sold millions of books!” he said. “I’ve had sex with hundreds, maybe thousands, of women.

In the blacked-out setting for the Calvin Klein show on Thursday, the actresses Emma Stone (in red) and Rooney. Mara (in black) took their front-row places next to Emmanuelle Alt and Franca Sozzani, the editors respectively of French Vogue and Italian Vogue. Ms. Alt’s usual game face for a show is either one of mild boredom or profound boredom. At Calvin, her expression was somewhere in between, and while most of the journalists in the room would have been eager to chat up Ms. Mara, Ms. Alt barely acknowledged her. Things got stranger when Eric Wilson, of The New York Times, tried to speak to Ms. Mara after the show about the Oscars (a lot of people are interested in what she will wear) and got a brushoff. One of the most sought-after actresses is sitting at a press event, surrounded by sophisticated editors and writers, and she pulls a Garbo. Priceless.

He was joined by the remarkable photographer Moises Saman, the two of them traveling by motorcycle along smugglers’ paths through the mountains bordering Lebanon, and then being moved from safe house to safe house by the young revolutionaries they were reporting on. As with all of his work (see this story from Iraq, and this from Beirut, both of which appeared in the magazine this past year), “Sons of No One” is a line-by-line testament to Anthony’s courage, yes, but also to his exquisite reporting instincts, his profound knowledge of the Arab world, his elegant mind and, even under such difficult conditions, his unfailing generosity and compassion and humor.

It was that same gift for empathy that made him such a good reporter. You could see it in his face as he stood in Tahrir Square or on the Tripoli seafront: his head tilted slightly and nodding, his dark eyes narrowed in focus as he listened to some young revolutionary. It was Anthony’s sense of mission that set him apart, I think, and gave his temperament and his work a uniquely unselfish aspect. He wasn’t in it to win prizes or lucrative desk jobs or to retail his adventures in a bar. He felt he had a duty to record the voices and emotions of Arabs as their world was unraveling. Where that sense of mission came from I do not know. But I was grateful for it.

But that was that: I didn’t do more skips; my knees couldn’t take it, and I soon ran out of breath. Nor could I do the leaps, twirls, step-overs and girly hops I’d seen on the Internet.

Perot won close to 20 percent of the vote, and his success was instrumental in making deficit reduction one of Bill Clinton’s top priorities.

Like others, I worry about electing the wrong person by accident. (See: Ralph Nader and George W. Bush.)

Both the makeup artist Wendy Rowe and the hairstylist Neil Moodie made references to a city woman escaping to nature, weather not withstanding, as the muse for the look. “It’s the girl who leaves town and doesn’t mind getting her hands dirty,” Rowe said. She created a smoky effect using Burberry’s Sable shadow and a flat brush between lashes. Mulberry and shimmery Midnight Brown were applied lightly around the lid and Gold Trench under the eye. Number 3 concealer was dotted on the inner corner of the eye socket and cheekbones were sculptured with Earthy blush. Lips were primed with foundation and then either Sepia Pink or Mocha Glow tapped on with a finger. “A dark sumptuous eye,” said Rowe of the overall effect, stressing it not be too heavy or perfect, lest it not feel modern. Moodie described hair as a three-day-old blow-dry with “dropped out” curls. He used Bumble and Bumble Prep Spray and Thickening Spray spread from the middle of wet hair, through the ends before diffusing for natural texture. A large-barrel curling iron was then applied randomly throughout the hair and Brilliantine applied to the mussed-up ends.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/backstage-beauty-report-burberry-2/

2012-02-21,"A Ramos Gin Fizz, A Muskrat Ramble","Why am I not in New Orleans right now? One of my closest friends has temporarily fled Brooklyn to spend the winter there; her cheery recent dispatches have prominently featured darling dogs in resplendent costumes, a shimmering heap of boiled crayfish and a luscious-looking muffuletta—that superior sandwich specimen made with many varieties of salumi, cheese, and salty, chewy olive salad. Another friend is there just for Mardi Gras, mostly to take in as much brilliant Crescent City music as he can. Another will be moving there, permanently, next week. What I wouldn’t give to join them—at least for a drink or two. The Sazerac may be the city’s most celebrated cocktail, and it’s an undeniably great one — a heady, aromatic combo of rye, bitters (Peychaud, or Peychaud and Angostura) and a muddled sugar cube, in a glass slicked with Herbsaint (or absinthe), shpritzed with essence from a lemon peel. Its delicious complexity has made it a favorite among many cocktail devotees I’ve known, on both sides of the bar. I tilt towards brown liquor in the winter, and I’d never turn down a Sazerac. But I’ve been flirting with gin fizzes ever since I discovered that the Electric Current Fizz is the ultimate hair of the dog. So today, I’m making myself another one of New Orleans’s greatest drinks: the Ramos gin fizz, invented in 1888 by Henrico Ramos. Amanda Hesser discussed its fascinating history in when she wrote about the drink in the magazine in 2008, and offered recipes from 1935 and a very updated version.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/a-ramos-gin-fizz-a-muskrat-ramble/

Smolder pencil and brown shimmer Coffee Walnut Pro Sculpting Cream (available later this year). “Tough” eyebrows were added to the boyish face while lips were paled with concealer. Gloss was patted on dewy cheeks to catch wisps pulled loose around the hairline. Marc Trinder used Charles Worthington Mussed Up Texturising Spray for what he called “a grungy, greasy finish” and Front Row Salt Spray to mattify the ends.

2012-02-22,Is Romney Reading Krugman?,"At a campaign stop in Michigan on Tuesday, Mitt Romney made news by telling the truth about the economy. He said: “If you just cut, if all you’re thinking about doing is cutting spending, as you cut spending you’ll slow down the economy. So you have to, at the same time, create pro-growth tax policies.”The idea that spending reductions slow, rather than spur the economy is what Paul Krugman, The Times editorial board, and many liberal economists have been advancing since the downturn. (Simply put: You can’t cut your way to growth.) It’s also in keeping with the Obama administration’s arguments. As Jack Lew, the White House chief of staff said recently on Meet the Press, “I think that there’s pretty broad agreement that the time for austerity is not today…Right now we have a recovery that’s taking root and if we were to put in an austerity measures right now, it would take the economy in the wrong way.”",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/is-romney-reading-krugman/

2012-02-22,"Marriage, Self-Interest and Happiness","Matt Yglesias has an interesting intervention in the debate over Charles Murray’s “Coming Apart.” In a nutshell, he suggests that the decline of marriage in the American working class doesn’t necessarily reflect a social or an economic crisis. Rather, it’s a rational — and in certain ways, laudable — response to an age of female empowerment and material abundance. In the current socioeconomic landscape, the sexes simply need each other less: Women are “newly empowered and less dependent on male economic support,” he notes, which has made them “somewhat choosier” about their mates; men, meanwhile, are less likely to do the hard work necessary to be solid marriage material because hard work is unpleasant, and it’s easier to lead a life of leisure than ever before. “To a certain puritanical frame of mind that views toil as a virtue in and of itself,” he writes, “this may seem unfortunate,” but leisure is one of civilization’s great achievements: “George Jetson, after all, only worked nine hours a week. Why should we aspire to anything less?” Yes, the new order may be somewhat harder on children, but absent evidence of true social disintegration (soaring crime rates, collapsing educational attainment, riots in the streets), “why not just look at progress and call it ‘progress’?”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/marriage-self-interest-and-happiness/
2012-02-22,Vain Glorious | Phylia de M.,"“Everyone’s hair has the potential to look amazing,” says Kazu Namise of Phylia de M., the Los Angeles-based hair care brand she founded late last year. For anyone who’s spent a lifetime abusing their mane via dye, diet and/or questionable styling techniques, that statement is as much a challenge as an affirmation. But Phylia de M. is hair care with a difference: it’s based on science, specifically research conducted by Namise’s godfather, oncologist Dr. Dick Miyayama, who dealt with his own impending hair loss by delving into the root cause (pun entirely intended) of the problem. “What he found was that over time, the nerves that supply keratin (which is vital to hair health) to the hair become disconnected, which can lead to hair loss, thinning and dryness. But if you reconnect the nerves, then your hair is restored to good health,” Namise explains. What makes the reconnection possible is Phylia de M.’s proprietary blend of aloe, a powerful antioxidant; tannic acid, a plant-based reparative; and pure, humic-free fulvic acid (created by Miyayama), which provides vital keratin to cells and “reminds” them to perform at optimum capacity. This restorative triumvirate is the basis for all three Phylia de M. products, but is especially potent in the ultra-concentrated Connect spray, which has the power to transform even parched hair into the lush locks worthy of a romance novel heroine. And that, Namise says, is a promise.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/vain-glorious-phylia-de-m/

2012-02-24,How to Be a European (Union) Philosopher,"One of the motivations behind the creation of the European Union was to assist in the social, economic and individual flourishing of citizens and workers who actually felt European regardless of their birthplace or current residence. I’ve been told that I not only embody such citizenship — I was raised in Rome, Vienna and Geneva, studied philosophy in Turin and Berlin, and now work in Barcelona — but also present a model of a European Union philosopher (because I  promote and teach continental philosophy). While as an E.U. citizen I’m delighted we are all allowed to reside in all these beautiful cities of the continent, as a philosopher I’m alarmed by the E.U.’s ongoing existential exclusions — that is, its forgetfulness of being. I’m not referring simply to a devaluation of the philosopher’s role in society, which is much more pronounced in other parts of the world, but rather something much more vital.When we speak of being from the existential-hermeneutic point of view, as those interested in philosophy well know, we are not referring to the factual existence of things but rather to the force of the people, thinkers and artists who generated our history. Thus, each epoch can be alluded to in the name that great philosophers have given to being in their work — “act” in Aquinas Middle Ages, “absolute spirit” in Hegel’s modernity, or “trace” in Derrida’s postmodernity. It is between being and nothing. But being also denotes how our existence is hermeneutic, in other words, a distinctive interpretative project in search of autonomous life. We exist first and foremost as creatures who manage to question our own being and in this way project our lives. Without this distinctiveness we would not exist; that is, our lives would be reduced to a predetermined subordination to the dominant philosophical or political system.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/how-to-be-a-european-union-philosopher/

2012-02-24,Foreign Bodies,"Sometime in the unspecified future, a series of detonations has all but destroyed the world. A handpicked few were given refuge in the Dome, a high-tech bubble designed to withstand environmental disaster. Those left outside were not so fortunate. The intensity of the explosions not only devastated the landscape but changed forever those who survived it, fusing people with animals, with objects, with the earth. The lucky ones can still function. One young man has a slavering dog instead of a leg and has “learned how to walk with a quick, uneven limp.” Another has several birds embedded in his back, their wings moving under his shirt. Some types are common enough to have been given names: the Groupies, drunk and vicious, have been bound into one massive body, while the feral Beasts are half man, half animal. The Dusts are barely human at all, monsters who have bonded to rocks and rubble, and who drag themselves out of the ground like living land mines to devour any creature that strays too close.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/books/review/pure-julianna-baggotts-dystopian-novel.html

But good prose is so much less of a mystery, finally, so much less of a shock, than bad prose. Good prose, after all, relates to our shared essence: we know it when we read it, we assent to it, we get it. Bad prose, on the other hand, is arrestingly weird.

The Clydebank cemetery is full of laid-off shipyard workers and their wives and children. Mick remembers sealing hulls with asbestos, packing it into snowballs to throw at his pals, then shaking the dried powder from his trousers for his wife to clean.

Reviewing the trilogy’s concluding volume, “Mockingjay,” in the Book Review in September 2010, Katie Roiphe tried to explain the appeal of Collins’s young protagonist, Katniss Everdeen: “Katniss is bossy, moody, bratty, demanding, prickly. She treats the world with an explosive aggression that is a little out of the ordinary, to say the least. She greets one admirer’s expression of love by knocking him down, slams a door on another’s face during an argument, shoots an arrow at a panel of judges before the Games begin and threatens a mentor with a knife when he says something she doesn’t like. In short, she belongs to a recent tribe of popular heroines: the small, difficult teenage girl who manifests enormous physical and moral strength. She is both murderer and victim, somehow representing female strength and female vulnerability all mingled and entwined, dangerously, ambiguously, into one. She is Pippi Longstocking. She is the girl with the dragon tattoo. She is mesmerizing.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

There, all sorts of lightly sauced sea creatures end up on a plate alongside a slice of the golden (sometimes white) polenta. It makes a fine foil, rather like a plain potato. Sometimes it is paired with tiny shrimp splashed with Prosecco, or cuttlefish in an inky sugo, or with tender miniature squid called calamaretti, cooked whole.

If the Philharmonic were interested in being regarded as a vital, contemporary institution, it might have taken an exploration of the connections between aural and visual timbre as an opportunity to mine the kaleidoscopic new-music repertory and used the theme to provide helpful landmarks for its audience.

Hecht wrote for the court. The case involved a landowner who had been unable to get permission from local groundwater managers to use as much groundwater as he sought. Thomas Mason, a lawyer who specializes in water rights with the Austin firm of Graves Dougherty Heron & Moody, said the ruling was likely to prompt litigation by landowners wanting to sink more wells or draw more water than the local authorities had permitted. At the same time, he said, groundwater managers were less likely to be aggressive in enforcing limits on water usage. Texas has 96 groundwater districts.

It’s way over my head.” Whether recording to four-track tape or performing at venues legal and not, he actually plays his instruments; there are no samples. The resulting mix is gritty and emotional, a rare combination for the genre. “Fidelity isn’t really important,” he says. “Human error in recordings shows that the artist is with you every step of the way. They endured the same length of time to create the melodies — or antimelodies — as it takes to listen.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/timely-frank-midnite-back-to-the-future/

First-rate directors turned in middling work (Scorsese with “Hugo,” Spielberg with “War Horse,” Fincher with “Dragon Tattoo,” Eastwood with “J. Edgar”), much-anticipated films landed with the thud (“Iron Lady”), and even the smarter hits (“Moneyball” and “Contagion,” for instance) were effective without being memorable.

Pieroni felt these rich colors complemented the designer Marco Zanini’s inspiration for the collection: glazed Scandinavian pottery. To create a violet eye and plum mouth, she used Clé de Peau eye shadow in Pewter 118 and 116 Wine, while lips were covered in R10. “It feels very soft, almost folky looking,” said Eugene Souleiman of the low ponytail he decided upon for the show. First, hair was separated into five parts, the top panel spread with Wella Natural Volume Styling Mousse (to have a matted quality when brushed out) before the panel below was teased and the other three sections pulled down to cover the ears just above the bottom lobes. This was secured with a special barrette covered in shellacked cinnamon sticks (found at an accessory shop in the Marais), which Souleiman thought fit with the sheen seen on ceramics fresh out of the kiln. “I didn’t want it to look ostentatious or vulgar — more raw. She’s intelligent and creative,” Souleiman said of this Rochas girl. “People will say, ‘Oh wow, what an amazing, stylish woman, I wonder what she does?’ It’s a different kind of beauty.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/backstage-beauty-report-rochas/
