Hers is a small but diversified operation that gets ingredients like herbs and produce from nearby farms and food companies and turns them into limited runs of 30 to 500 bottles, often with poetic names. “Supporting local agriculture is what we do, and we’re having fun,” she said. Whiskey is made from mash using leftover bread from She Wolf Bakery in Brooklyn.

2021-08-03,"Bar Blondeau Opens in the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn","Occasionally, the pandemic has had salutary results, and this new bar on the sixth floor of the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg is one example. When they opened Le Crocodile, the French brasserie on the hotel’s ground floor, the partners, Jon Neidich and the chefs Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber, had their eye on a sixth-floor space for a wine bar. So in May 2019, they opened it as Lemon’s, with a breezy Coastal Italian approach. “It was meant to be temporary, a pop-up,” Mr. Neidich said. “It did not have a full kitchen, and we planned to renovate it.” Closing for Covid gave the partners more than a year to install the kitchen and redo the space, which offered views of the Empire State Building. The partners were inspired by Parisian neo-bistros and wine bars. “Their quality is at a high level, but they’re more informal than restaurants,” Mr. Neidich said. The menu features small plates, many of them with seafood like lobster salad, oysters and salmon rillettes. A few more substantial items include halibut and chips, and paella rice with duck and snails. Among the desserts is chocolate babka with salted caramel ice cream. The wine list, assembled by the beverage director Rafa García Febles, is global and lengthy, with many choices by the glass and several nonalcoholic drinks, for which Mr. Neidich said he sees increasing demand. Warm oak walls, banquettes, green velvet and golden lighting define the space, which seats 70 in several areas, including an outdoor terrace.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Today, he’s known for immortalizing the work of the 20th-century architect Horace Gifford with his 2013 book, “Fire Island Modernist,” and for his own reimaginings of midcentury styles and spaces — he recently completed a restoration of a late ’60s Harry Bates-designed home in Fire Island Pines. Moving uptown, says Rawlins, would allow him to reconceptualize his life. “I realized I didn’t have to be a cool kid in the Village and that, if I worked out of my home, I could call the shots professionally,” he says. And so he and his then-partner, the artist Tad Mike, purchased two units in the same 1935 cream brick co-op — a 700-square-foot one-bedroom to live in, and a 1,050-square-foot two-bedroom two floors below to use for their studios — and Rawlins launched his own practice.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/t-magazine/an-elegant-inwood-apartment-designed-for-living-and-working.html

Lately, he has found them lacking their customary verve and intensity, a shortcoming he attributes to global warming. But not those made in 2020. He raves about the vintage. Though his company imports 22 different oils, some are worth knowing, like leccino oils by Pruneti, a classic; and Sàgona, more forceful, $59.99 for both. A new oil for his company is the herbaceous Fonte di Foiano 1979 from the Bolgheri region, sold as part of a set of six from areas in and around Chianti for $157.50. Also in that set is the Volpaia from the Classico district, a blend of several olives that’s deep green, minty and viscous with bracing bitterness. The oils, all sold in half-liter bottles, are to use for finishing, not sautéing, to elevate a bowl of pappa al pomodoro or grilled fennel, or to trace over slices of rosemary-scented pork roast.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/dining/tuscan-olive-oil.html

Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. It’s salty enough to use in place of table salt, though it’s substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sautéed fish. That flavor disappears in cake batter or pasta sauce. While Green Salt is more costly than regular kosher or sea salt, it’s comparable in price to many boutique salts.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/dining/green-salt.html

Climate change has turned the south of England into sparkling wine country, something the French acknowledge onscreen, with admiration; some French producers now own vineyards in England.

In brief: Back in 2002, a survey of one of the last habitats of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, showed a tiger population that, in biologist-speak, amounted to only 1.6 tigers per 100 square kilometers. He learned of a significant improvement: 2.8 tigers per 100 square kilometers. Here was statistical proof that their approach — a collaboration with the Indonesian government to infiltrate poaching networks and prevent a cycle of livestock deaths and revenge killings — had been effective.

His collection includes contributions from Jerry Craft, Tochi Onyebuchi and Jason Reynolds, and explores sexual identity, intergalactic warfare, skateboarding and loss. With irresistibly named tales like “There’s Going to Be a Fight in the Cafeteria on Friday and You Better Not Bring Batman,” the vibe is playful with a side of gravity; as Mbalia writes, “Grab your string cheese. Prepare to laugh, cry and maybe even dance, but most of all, prepare to feel joyful.” At the moment, “Black Boy Joy” is the only anthology on the middle grade list — but readers may also be interested in Joanna Farrow’s “The Official Harry Potter Baking Book,” currently at No. 3, which teaches kids how to whip up Wand Breadsticks, Quidditch Pitch Focaccia and Whomping Willow Cheese Straws.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/books/review/black-boy-joy-kwame-mbalia.html

The big, clear ice cube, usually made from molds these days, is a signature that the Japanese cocktail culture has brought to cocktails in the United States and elsewhere. Mr. Urushido, an owner of Katana Kitten, a bar in the West Village, details the precise approach the Japanese take, not just to carve the ice, but to assemble drinks. He describes his career, from low-rung beginnings as a food runner to a sought-after mixologist in Japan and New York. The book explains high-end cocktail bars in Japan and more informal izakayas; his bar blends both. Many of the book’s recipes, with long drinks and Japanese riffs on classics, are demanding; some simpler examples are the Japanese highball using frozen whiskey; the Far East Side with sake, tequila and shiso leaves; and Friday in the Park combining pear cider and vermouth (though he recommends making your own vermouth).

Likely created from stories he heard while stationed in Persia (modern-day Iran), Ctesias’ “Indica” — a written catalog of the unknown world — shimmers with the sublime and the absurd: notes on a race of people with a single leg; descriptions of chimeric beasts. But it was the unicorn, possessor of what Ctesias described as a cinnabar-red anklebone, that remains his most enduring contribution. (The scholar Chris Lavers, author of 2009’s “The Natural History of Unicorns,” has written that Ctesias assembled the unicorn out of three animals indigenous to the region: the Indian rhinoceros, whose horn is associated with medicinal properties; the goatlike, horned chiru; and the reddish-and-white-colored kiang, a large wild ass.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/t-magazine/unicorns-culture-myth.html

The spaces were used in the past by A.I.G. executives for board meetings, private dining and contract-signing ceremonies. They have been converted into this restaurant featuring experiential tasting menus ($245 per person, including tax and a welcome beverage); an elegant, oval cocktail bar called Overstory; and, at the very top, a private dining room. There are a total of 12 terraces with breathtaking views in every direction. Diners will get to see every inch of Saga, including the kitchen, as they are guided from room to room for each course of the executive chef James Kent’s meal. “Menus are conversations,” said Jeff Katz, the general manager and co-owner. “We’re trying to eliminate the standard come-into-the-restaurant, sit-at-the-table and start-the-meal-in-20-minutes format.” Customers need not dine at Saga to belly up to the brass-and-marble bar at the 24-seat Overstory, which is reached by a dramatic flight of stairs.

Today, the motif is referred to as the Widmanstätten patterns or the Thomson structures, but no matter who gets credit, they are among nature’s most hypnotic creations. Rolex, the Swiss watchmaker, has used meteorite for its dials in the past, backing thin slices of it with brass, but now, the company has reimagined its iconic Cosmograph Daytona with a face made from a solid slab of chemically treated fallen star.

To the sea-weary Gallagher, their protest looked more like a celebration. But she also felt, in this nexus of “Europe and Africa in the Americas,” she says, the “whimsical cruelty” of the imperial powers that had sought to carve up the globe, imposing vast cultural distance between places — predominantly white, Anglophone New England and Black, Francophone Martinique — that were so close you could readily sail between them.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/t-magazine/black-artists-expatriates.html

2021-08-20,A Futuristic Chair From the ’50s,"The modern architect Gio Ponti created many of his iconic furniture pieces between the wars, but those from the 1950s are among his most sensuously radical. Embracing the revolution in industrial manufacturing and new materials in Europe, he conceived of the Round D.154.5 chair in 1954. With its contoured, soap bar-shaped back and seat, connected by two arcs of molded plywood, it was covered in two-tone Vipla, an Italian marine vinyl. Ponti referred to it informally as “otto pezzi,” or “eight pieces,” for the number of components used in the deceptively simple design, and featured the hyperfuturistic chair at Alitalia’s Manhattan offices, which opened in 1958. Now, in collaboration with the Ponti archives, the Italian furniture brand Molteni & C has reimagined the work in ash wood and covered in a variety of textiles and leathers, including this terra-cotta-colored linen. Wearing its covert innovations lightly, and still fashioned from a mere otto pezzi, the chair remains as rigorously insurgent as it is supremely comfortable.

2021-08-20,A Celestial Cuff Modeled After One Made for Marlene Dietrich,"Alfred Van Cleef, the son of a diamond cutter, married Estelle Arpels, the daughter of a precious stones dealer and, about a decade later, in 1906, the house of Van Cleef & Arpels opened its doors on Paris’s Place Vendôme. By the 1920s, the maison was experimenting with exotic Art Deco creations and, in the early ’30s, it pioneered a groundbreaking new technique called the Mystery Set, by which gemstones could be arranged in a mosaiclike pattern without any visible supports. Its sautoirs, minaudières and brooches quickly became favorites among royals and Hollywood stars including Marlene Dietrich, for whom Van Cleef created one of its most iconic designs, the Jarretière bracelet, in 1937. The story goes that Dietrich gave a handful of her gemstone-studded pieces to Louis Arpels, the brother of Estelle and one of the company’s founders, and asked him to create something special. And so the Jarretière was born: The modernist platinum cuff featured an exaggerated, asymmetrical loop covered in cushion-cut rubies set atop twin bucklelike bands of baguette-and-pavé-set white diamonds. (The piece’s name translates to “garter,” and indeed the design resembles the band worn around the top of a woman’s stocking.) Dietrich famously wore it in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1950 noir thriller, “Stage Fright” (she also insisted on head-to-toe Dior for the role), and to the Academy Awards a year later.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/t-magazine/van-cleef-arche-solaire-bracelet.html

In 1943, Chandler’s third novel, “The High Window,” was read by the Paramount director Billy Wilder. He liked the way Chandler wrote dialogue, and offered him a contract of $750 a week for 10 weeks to work with him on a screenplay for “Double Indemnity,” James M. Cain’s novel. Chandler had never written for the screen, and didn’t like the idea of being subservient to a young Austrian-born Jew who had written dozens of screenplays in Berlin and Hollywood.

His work was immanently desirable. Museums and private collectors started vying for it even before he had his first solo gallery show in New York in 1970. It had the instant pow of Pop Art — indeed the artist had stated his desire to knock people’s socks off. But it also had the haughtier, more conceptual imprimatur of Post-Minimalism, arguably the last avant-garde art movement of classic modernism.

Working mornings and afternoons, the artist made 50 acrylic paintings of the ocean, attempting to capture its look and mood in real time. The works, some of which are layered with cheerful streaks of blue and white while others feature diluted grays, are all dated, and together make up a kind of diary of the sea. Perhaps this all sounds a little old-fashioned — after all, the Atlantic has been popular with en plein-air painters since at least the late 19th century — but in fact, McGill’s works, which were done on sheets of recycled ocean plastic ranging from 25 to 45 feet in length, are part of a deeply contemporary project: a collaborative performance piece, one meant to raise awareness about rising sea levels, called “In the Waves.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/t-magazine/melissa-mcgill-newport-waves.html

Topping the special occasion list is Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins this year — 5782 — at sundown on Sept. 6. Apples are a symbol of the holiday on the Ashkenazi table, and the book features recipes for a cake studded and topped with them and bits of ginger. A very basic challah recipe and the whole-wheat version are included without directions for shaping the bread round, instead of braided, as is customarily done for the holiday. Rather, challah rolls with apple filling make suitable stand-ins, and the dough can be used to make one large loaf. The recipe for pletzel, a Polish specialty that’s also called onion board, deserves to be added to your flatbread collection. The book taps traditions, including those of Sephardic and Mizrachi cultures, in addition to Ashkenazic.

In his eagerness to familiarize me with the superiority of his (and now my) surrogate nation, he took particular care to show me the fundamental institutions that, according to him, made America great: the colossal gates granting entry to New Jersey’s very own Mycenae, the Woodbridge outlet mall; a Dunkin’ doughnut shop; the tube outside a drive-in TD Bank that sucks in checks. Pride shimmered in his eyes, but he grew increasingly irritated when I could not muster much enthusiasm for iced coffee and doughnuts. (I did not have it in me to tell him that Dunkin’ also has outposts in New Delhi, the city I left behind.) It was not until I came face to face with a tower of grenade-size red onions while browsing the organic-produce section at a Wegmans later that day that I felt my detachment toward this new country begin to ease a little.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/magazine/raw-onions-are-the-best-food-let-me-explain.html

2021-08-24,Bar Benno Opens in the Former Leonelli Restaurant and Bar Space,"Now that it’s time to begin reopening his restaurants in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad, the chef Jonathan Benno and his partners decided to do more than simply turn the key. In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, they’ve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when it’s ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors d’oeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pâté de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provençal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pig’s trotter with sauce gribiche. “I didn’t feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before,” Mr. Benno said. “I’ve been cooking French most of my whole career, so I’m very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation.” Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space that’s something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building.

It included, for each meal, the company my auntie expected and the menu, no matter how simple, and it was constantly revised.

Walking along West Broadway about a year after he arrived, he came across a stall where a group of potters were selling traditional, handcrafted Pennsylvanian ceramics and, though simple, the blue-and-white spongeware vessels captivated him. “I just couldn’t believe they were selling these objects that they had made themselves,” he says. “It blew me away.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/t-magazine/matthias-kaiser-ceramics-art.html

Montgomery’s “Anne of Green Gables” was panned because the main character “greatly marred a story that had in it quaint and charming possibilities.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/books/when-the-book-review-went-really-harsh.html

Large dishes are guava-glazed roasted chicken, aged churrasco (rib-eye for two) with chimichurri, and chaulafan (Ecuadorean fried rice) chicharrone using black rice, seafood, pork rinds and salsa verde. Deep-fried plantains (patacones) are served for the table, complimentary. Gilded Group’s beverage director, Daniel Bedoya, who was raised in Ecuador, has devised an array of cocktails.
