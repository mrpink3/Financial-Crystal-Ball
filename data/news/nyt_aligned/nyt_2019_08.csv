At the time, her character — a hacktivist named Ramsey — is careening through the New York City air in the passenger seat of a Mercedes-Benz that has been equipped to shoot harpoon-like projectiles. So the line rings out as somewhat unexpectedly conscientious. The chase, which includes Dwayne Johnson plowing through fallen scaffolding in a beefed-up pickup and culminates with a circle of vehicles firing their harpoon-things into a muscle car driven by Vin Diesel, also encapsulates the way this series taken the gas-guzzling action it introduced nearly two decades ago and, with each iteration, pushed matters even further over the top. “As the cars zig and the story line zags, these sequences grow baroque, defying reason and gravity, which have progressively come under siege in this franchise,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review of this most recent movie in the series for The New York Times. ” To chart out that increasing aversion to the laws of physics yourself (or to prepare for the spinoff, “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,” out this weekend), see also FAST & FURIOUS (2009) and FAST FIVE (2011), airing at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Syfy.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-fate-of-the-furious-and-no-one-saw-a-thing.html

Now, more than 40 years after his demise, he still hasn’t gone away. Since the caudillo’s grand funeral, his remains have been interred at the Valley of the Fallen, a colossal memorial to the victims of the Spanish Civil War. Located 30 miles northwest of Madrid, the site consists of a vast basilica carved into the side of a granite mountain ridge and topped with a 500-foot stone cross, the tallest in the world. The regime claimed that the memorial, which houses the remains of some 34,000 Civil War dead, was intended to honor all who fell in the conflict, but this was gaslighting on a world-historical scale: Tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of them former Republican soldiers, labored for almost 20 years, between 1940 and 1959, to build what would eventually become their tormentor’s final resting place.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/magazine/javier-marias-spanish-literature.html

Gender reveals now precede or even replace the traditional baby shower, marking the occasion when the proud parents first learn the sex of their unborn guest of honor. Until recently, expectant parents received this information without much fanfare during a routine ultrasound, or perhaps by phone, when a doctor called to relay amniocentesis results. But around a decade ago, people started passing the results, under seal, to obliging bakers, who would bake pink or blue cakes, conceal them in neutral-colored frosting and then deliver them to be cut open at a party in front of friends and family. The “reveal” allowed the parents to be surprised in public, record the moment for posterity and share it across social platforms, signaling which aggregation of gender norms and limitations friends and family were to immediately begin heaping on the fetus’s soft-skulled head.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/magazine/gender-reveal-fail-videos.html

It stands as a preface to Duriel E. Harris’s remarkable book “No Dictionary of a Living Tongue,” and as an incantation should not be read as much as entered. Details materialize along a space-time continuum that feels intensely familiar yet disquietingly inexplicable. Despite the opening disclaimer, we find ourselves following the bread-crumb trail of dream logic, each moment folding into the next, as vivid and inscrutable as the nested figurines in a Matryoshka doll.

She is, after all, a pop-culture archetype. In the 20 years since the movie, adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, was released to critical praise and disappointing ticket sales, Tracy’s name has become a synonym for relentless drive and obnoxious self-confidence. Her image — sending her hand skyward in class when she knows the answer, which is always; passing out cupcakes frosted with her own name; haranguing her schoolmates at Carver High to “Pick Flick” for student body president — has been immortalized in countless memes. Reese Witherspoon may have gone on to win an Oscar and run with the mean moms on “Big Little Lies,” but Tracy remains (along with Elle Woods from “Legally Blonde”) her defining role.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/movies/tracy-flick-reese-witherspoon.html

As the capital of Northern Ireland — increasingly known for its new restaurants and stimulating galleries — turns its Troubles into tourism, it is fast coming into its own as a European hot spot.

Olivia Colman stars as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “The Favourite,” which is making its TV debut tonight. Colman, who won an Academy Award for her performance, portrays Queen Anne, the last monarch of the House of Stuart, as she faces ill health and waning political credibility. But the film’s primary focus is the love triangle between Anne; Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), the Duchess of Marlborough and a close adviser to the queen; and Sarah’s rival, Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), a chambermaid turned close confidant. A.O. Scott, who chose the film as a Critic’s Pick, wrote in his New York Times review: “Weisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble, but Colman’s performance is nothing short of sublime. She commits absolutely to Anne’s ridiculousness, and also to the contradictory facets of her humanity.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/arts/whats-on-tv-saturday-the-favourite-burt-reynolds.html

The ice cream is churned for each order: The results are ultrasmooth since the quick freeze keeps the ice crystals from forming. Basic flavors are chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet cream and vegan chocolate, with housemade mix-in options. Specialty varieties include Key lime pie, cereal crunch, vegan chocolate peanut butter and spectacular s’mores.

A series of evenly spaced bang-bang-bang sounds is much more likely to be a gun than the more sporadic ba-bang, ba-ba-ba-ba-bang of firecrackers. When sensors record a gunlike noise in, say, Cape Town or Chicago, software analyzes it for the sonic signatures of gunfire, and within seconds Beisner and his team listen to those audio files and look at those recorded waveforms at their office in Newark, Calif. Confirmed or suspected gunfire incidents are then reported to the local police.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/magazine/how-to-tell-gunfire-from-fireworks.html

Once in a long while, a can of condensed milk would appear, and my sister and I would be invited to spread it on bread, or even eat it straight from the can with a spoon.

Chicago had gone into tens of thousands of dollars of debt to make it.

It stands alone with elegant velvet upholstery, marble tables and vintage touches. “I wanted to cater to the Gramercy neighborhood and have a beautiful setting, a place where you’d want to enjoy a bottle of wine,” he said. “Most restaurants with food from Singapore and Malaysia don’t have that.” Mr. Mehta is also an owner of Laut, a Malaysian restaurant nearby. Among the dishes at the new restaurant are curry puffs with potato, chicken and beef satays, crispy rice salad with vegetables, sweet and spicy chile crab, and Hainanese chicken with rice, chiles, garlic, shallots and soy sauce.

He was instantly hooked. Now 30, Brackens works from a studio in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he makes intricate weavings mainly from cotton, a material he uses for its versatility, he says, but also “to pay tribute to those who came before me.” His grandmother picked cotton as a child in Limestone County, Tex., where she and much of the rest of Brackens’s family later settled. “She had to do this thing that comes along with this awful history,” he says. “And if that is part of my story, I have to make very beautiful things.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/t-magazine/diedrick-brackens-artist.html

On the east side of Los Angeles in a light-filled former storefront, the sculptures, which weigh as much as 85 pounds, sit in orderly rows on unassuming steel tables and shelves, with not a speck of dust or wayward glaze in sight. “I try to keep my studio as clean and minimal as possible,” Rochefort says on an afternoon in June. And besides, with works in progress for his first institutional show, “Absorption by the Sun,” which opened Aug. 1 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara, he explains, “I’m running out of room.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/t-magazine/brian-rochefort-sculptor.html

So, with only a few hours left before opening, she ran down the street to an organic grocery store and quickly revised her concept: She would make a hearty jerk-plantain fritter paired with a citrus stew, topped with a creamy avocado sauce instead. “My brain is wired in a creative way,” Chaney says. “So when it comes to food and drinks, it’s hard to just make a recipe and think, ‘That is it.’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/t-magazine/francesca-chaney-sol-sips-first-sunday.html

Her gestures fill the air with a strange hurt. She calls the movement “the Quake,” and it swells long before the audience enters the theater to find Okpokwasili, 46, already onstage and working herself into a maniac sweat with her back to the room. After almost 15 minutes, she turns to face the audience. For a moment, her body sways with exhaustion, and her dark brown eyes stare vacantly at the expectant faces that fill the black box.

Along with a partner played by Jonah Hill, he rides a roller coaster of bad form that culminates in a Quaalude-impaired Lamborghini ride. “From its opening sequence — a quick, nasty, unapologetic tour through its main character’s vices and compulsions, during which he crash-lands a helicopter on the grounds of his Long Island estate and (not simultaneously) shares cocaine with a call girl in an anatomically creative manner — to its raw, chaotic finish, ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ hums with vulgar, voyeuristic energy,” A.O.

There are nature walks and wine tastings, leisurely bike rides and gallery visits, lighthouse tours and shopping. The dining and cultural scenes have broadened, too. One way to narrow the scope of your weekend travels is to concentrate on the Outer Cape towns of Eastham, Wellfleet and Truro, all within the Cape Cod National Seashore, which protects tens of thousands of acres from development. With towering dunes, strong surf and pine forests, the area feels more rugged and wild than the Mid Cape and less hectic than the tourist mecca (some might say trap) of Provincetown at the very tip.

Even though I could not yet read, I sought it out; I sat on the edge of the sofa, my bony 5-year-old chest flush with the wispy, tissue thin paper, and I ran my fingers across the pages, down the psalms. Reproductions of famous paintings appeared every hundred pages or so, colorful depictions of the stories of the Old and New Testaments enticing me even more.

2019-08-09,A Clothing Collection Inspired by the Bauhaus,"The daughter of Los Angeles-based artists, fashion designer Rosetta Getty bought her first artwork, a Robert Motherwell painting, with her earnings as a teenage model. Today, her collection includes pieces by Olympia Scarry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Piero Golia. Still, Getty says she’s “slow to acquire a work of art,” and has a habit of visiting a piece multiple times over several months as she considers whether it might have place in her life. “It doesn’t go from the gallery to a storage facility. Not only do I have to love the work, but I have to live in its presence.” Her clothing designs feel like a natural extension of this lifelong pursuit: for nearly every season of her five-year-old line, Getty has collaborated with an artist, “intuitively picking” an individual or movement that she wants to explore, and continuing the Getty family tradition of supporting the art community. One can see how she’s made that legacy her own with the easy drape of a tangerine satin slip dress she conceived of after seeing Anna Ostoya’s vibrant abstract paintings, say, or a ruched blouse that recalls the medical tubing in Hayden Dunham’s installations. “The process of working with an artist is very similar to my process of collecting,” Getty says, “With some, we might have met for a studio visit years before and had the opportunity to get to know each other over time.

While some comedians are redefining the stand-up genre, most specials still follow a basic formula: A comic takes the stage with nothing but a microphone in hand and delivers joke after joke after joke. Not so in this new special. Julio Torres, a “Saturday Night Live” writer who is also one of the creators, writers and stars of the Spanish-language HBO comedy series “Los Espookys,” spends this show introducing the audience to shapes rolled out on a conveyor belt. Each one has its own back story, such as the chipped rectangle who’s “having a really bad day” or the Ferrero Rocher chocolate who forgot to wear her skirt. Torres draws laughs not only because of his quirky imagination, but also because he delivers each line with a straight face. It’s as if the world he has created is completely normal, and we’re just late to the party.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-my-favorite-shapes-and-the-beach-bum.html

The plot involves a series of mysterious deaths. Among the ensemble is an elder played by George Takei, the “Star Trek” actor who as a child was among the roughly 120,000 West Coast Japanese-Americans who were forced into camps as a result of racist anti-espionage measures enacted after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. “This project is groundbreaking in that the story of the internment of Japanese-Americans is being told on this scale, this scope, for the first time” on TV, Takei recently told The New York Times. “It’s massive, 10 hours, 10 episodes and in such depth — the characters are examined in depth.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-the-terror-and-family-pictures-usa.html

2019-08-12,The Designer Ushering a Couture House Into a Brave New Era,"SCHIAPARELLI. THE NAME alone conjures images of absurd beauty: lobsters as dresses, a shoe as a hat, a particularly blinding shade of pink — and, of course, the fearless Italian modernist herself, Elsa Schiaparelli, who fled her conservative Italian family and con man of a husband to become one of fashion’s great iconoclasts. And so it’s only fitting that, for his debut as artistic director at the house, founded in 1927, Daniel Roseberry began with an origin story of his own. On the first day of the Paris couture shows this past July, the handsome 33-year-old sat down at a drafting table positioned in the middle of the runway inside the Pavillon Cambon, on a set meant to resemble the unheated Chinatown studio in New York where he created his first set of drawings for the brand last December. As the designer picked up his pencil, the lights went up and the models appeared, his sketches coming to life. There were no lip brooches or skeleton dresses; none of the totems Elsa made famous. Instead, Roseberry put forth his own proposal for fearlessness and surrealism, a celebration of both material craftsmanship and the female form. There were wild takes on suiting — a long navy captain’s coat trimmed at the sleeves and bias in flat gold leather bands resembling ruffled military ribbons worn over a delicate black-and-white lace bodysuit; a sharp barathea tuxedo jacket with 117 dangling crystal tassels, each affixed to the garment with a single scarlet-lacquered acrylic fingernail — and fantastical evening looks, some with bedazzled breast cups in ruby, diamond and sapphire hues that appeared to float on their own above heavy raw silk tulip skirts in chalky blue, sunflower yellow or acid green. For the finale, two gowns — one sheet white, the other a wild rose pink — pushed the idea of illusion further still, with supple silk taffeta that billowed out and above the models as if a gust of Marilyn Monroe-style wind had blown these confections toward the heavens and frozen them in that moment. Here, as in the original house of Schiaparelli, there was no place for self-doubt.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/t-magazine/daniel-roseberry-schiaparelli.html

2019-08-14,Arthur Jafa in Bloom,"“VIBES,” SAYS ARTHUR JAFA, clicking through images on a screen in his Los Angeles studio, all part of an extended mood board for a future project — photographs from the Harlem Renaissance, glamorous black-and-whites of vintage cars and fashion, work by Roy DeCarava — “more vibes.” It’s the morning after Jafa’s 58th birthday, and the polymathic artist, cinematographer and theorist of black culture threw himself a party the night before in this space in the West Adams neighborhood, not far from his home in Ladera Heights. The spotless studio is now empty save for a suite of computers and a large-scale photographic printer the size of a refrigerator. On one wall, there’s a sculpture: a seated man, his horrifically fissured back turned to the viewer. The work was inspired by an 1863 abolitionist photograph of a former slave identified as Gordon — it is at once abject and regal and, in Jafa’s 2017 rendition, creepily mesmerizing. The space is new, a place to test out ideas before placing them in a gallery, and late in the day, he shows me a prototype that didn’t work out, tucked in the back: an adult-size oblong of industrial-grade plastic. It takes a few moments of mounting dread to understand that I’m looking at the bundled shape of a lynched woman, meant to be part of a series called “Hang Time.” “Now I have a $60,000 hat stand,” he says dryly.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/t-magazine/arthur-jafa-in-bloom.html

2019-08-15,36 Hours in Santa Barbara County,"With its Mission-style facades and showy tropical foliage, Santa Barbara could be a commercial for the California good life. It can be easy to underestimate the struggles of a place so seemingly flawless. But Santa Barbara has had a tough few years. From the devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 to the flooding and mudslides that followed, the county has experienced more than its share of trauma. Yet if it weren’t for the charred chaparral faintly visible on the surrounding hillsides, the average visitor might never know. This is, after all, a place that’s good at reinventing itself. That spirit is on display at the new Hotel Californian, which sits on the site of a grand beach resort that was destroyed — just weeks after opening — by the 1925 earthquake that defined modern Santa Barbara’s architecture and character. Smack in the center of Southern California’s spectacular coastline, the county is surprisingly rural. In its multigenerational ranches and farms, its remarkably undeveloped public beaches, and the expansive Los Padres National Forest, Santa Barbara County offers glimpses of California before it got crowded.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-santa-barbara-county.html

Before his death in 1989, Foley (whose real name was Michael Fuller) made a name for himself singing country songs and picking an acoustic guitar. He’s played here by the actor and musician Ben Dickey, who stars opposite Alia Shawkat. Shawkat plays Sybil Rosen, an actress and theater artist with whom Foley runs off to the woods, in search of romance and creative freedom outside the constraints of the music business. The guitarist Charlie Sexton also features in the cast, portraying the singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt, who was a friend of Foley’s. Hawke “is clearly motivated by nothing but affection for Blaze, Townes, Sybil and the state of Texas,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “He doesn’t so much scramble biopic conventions as allow himself and the audience to be distracted from them.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-blaze-and-a-jim-gaffigan-quality-time.html

On a trip to Tangier, he came across “Mère et Fils,” a 2014 book of photographs by the now 61-year-old French artist Denis Dailleux, who lived in Egypt for many years. The images, at once erotic and tender, were of shirtless male Egyptian bodybuilders photographed with their mothers. Barthélemy, now 30, was so struck by them that he decided to go to Cairo himself, where he fell in love with the chaos of the city. He later moved there, into a spacious but faded ’60s-era flat. One day, he visited a tiny stall south of Bab Zuwayla in Suq al-Khayamiya (“Tentmakers’ Market”), where an artisan named Tarek Abdelhay Hafez Abouelenin was hand-making a khayamiya — a vibrant quiltlike work featuring ornate appliqué patterns sewn onto a plain cotton canvas backing, a textile that has been used to cover the insides of tents at weddings, celebrations and funerals for over a millennium. Not surprisingly, the meticulous, time-consuming work is a dying art (most contemporary khayamiya are digitally printed), which made Abouelenin’s work all the more extraordinary. The two men agreed to collaborate on a different sort of khayamiya, one that would stray from traditional arabesque and calligraphic motifs — and would defy the Islamic taboo against both realistic representation and homoeroticism.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/t-magazine/louis-barthelemy-tapestries-nazuna-kyoto-gosho-culture-fashion-news.html

But anyone who has worked in or knows someone who works in fashion, from the humblest tailor to the starriest creative director, also knows that the business in fact bears a strong resemblance to the restaurant industry, another realm where the risks (and rate of failure) are high, the payoff is usually small, and in which dedication, talent, financial savvy and personality can be nothing against the vicissitudes of luck.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/t-magazine/ts-fall-womens-fashion-issue-the-tribe.html

Now, She’s at Her Most Prolific.","Memory is as important to the work of Lynda Benglis as any of her artistic materials, including the globular polyurethane foam and wax for which she is perhaps best known. A pioneer of free-form sculpture who radically pushed the medium in the late ’60s, she fills her biomorphic abstract works with the textures, sounds and images of the past. The artist’s coming exhibition at Pace Gallery in Palo Alto, Calif., which will open on August 21, includes work from four decades of her career, ranging from the curving tubular “sparkle paper” sculptures she has produced since 2013 — brightly colored totems created from handmade paper draped around amorphous chicken-wire forms — to “Eat Meat,” a fleshy human-size blob of poured-polyurethane foam that Benglis first fashioned in 1969 and recast in aluminum in 2012. Each piece in the show is laced with memory. Recently, she recalled how her childhood trips from her hometown, Lake Charles, La., to the rocky Greek island of Kastellorizo, where her paternal grandparents once lived, informed her fascination with rugged textures, while she attributed her keen understanding of color, seen in works such as the hot-pink crystalline cast-polyurethane wall sculpture “Swinburne Figure I” (2009) and the shimmering multicolor paper-and-wire sculpture “Flag Twister” (2017), to watching birds as a girl with her grandfather in Mississippi.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/t-magazine/lynda-benglis.html

Jack Harris, a partner and the executive chef at Mr. Stulman’s Fairfax and Bar Sardine, is in the kitchen. Like Mr. Stulman, he was inspired by Clamato, a trendy Paris bistronomie.

As recently as the 1950s, doctors considered exercise dangerous for people over age 40; for heart disease, which was then killing a record number of Americans, they prescribed bed rest. This was partly based on their concept of what “exercise” was: Early physiologists conducted studies on their (typically young, male) graduate students or on military servicemen — and in order to become more fit than they already were, these subjects needed to work out hard. “The mantra was, You have to go to a gym, you have to do high-intensity physical activity,” says Abby C.

In the States, people are like, ‘Oh, that’s so hipster to call it small goods!’ But it’s actually an appropriate term: We can do knives and cutting boards, make it more of a lifestyle brand.” The couple moved from New York City to the town of Goldens Bridge, N.Y., last year, in anticipation of the birth of their daughter, Nina, who is now almost 10 months old — and they quickly adapted to the extra space, proximity to close friends and entertaining opportunities that decision afforded them.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/t-magazine/erika-nakamura-jocelyn-guest-barbecue.html

The Milan-based label started as a textile purveyor to other houses before expanding into a full-fledged fashion brand known for its bohemian sensibility, rich color combinations and signature paisleys — the latter inspired by Gimmo’s travels to India, which led him to become obsessed with the tear-dropped motif, just like Mughal Empire courtiers and 18th-century Parisians before him. Veronica, too, showed a taste for prints at a young age. After studying fashion at Central Saint Martins in London, she returned to Milan to help design Etro’s ready-to-wear at the age of 23. Three years later, in 2000, she debuted her first collection as the creative director of women’s wear, and still oversees the family business with her father and three older brothers today.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/t-magazine/veronica-etro.html

2019-08-22,A Return to Beloved Hippie-Era Beauty Products,"The current trend for natural skin care, from rosehip face oils to rhassoul clay masks, owes a great deal to the first wave of the movement, which gained momentum in the 1960s and ’70s when earthy, do-it-all formulas made with uncomplicated plant-derived ingredients — and a certain free-spirited, hippie mentality — abounded. Such products captured a moment in time, when wellness didn’t feel like a marketing concept, and you could relax in a salt bath without feeling the urge to document it on social media. It’s this slow, simple approach to self-care that has sparked a renewed interest in these retro goods in our modern age.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/t-magazine/hippie-beauty-products.html

Following in the same tradition as shows like “Breaking Bad,” “Weeds” and “Ozark,” this dark comedy series focuses on the often disastrous lengths that a person will go to achieve their version of the American dream. In this iteration, drug trafficking is swapped for the nefarious trappings of a multilevel marketing scheme, one that leaves Krystal Stubbs (Kirsten Dunst), a Florida water park employee, destitute after her husband (a mulleted Alexander Skarsgard) goes all in. Using her gumption and business savvy, Stubbs cons her way up the cultlike pyramid scheme with help from one of its loyal followers (Théodore Pellerin), only to wreak havoc on those closest to her. The series’s oddball Florida setting, ostentatious 1990s fashion and colorful characters creates room for it to join some of the most delightfully weird shows on TV right now, like AMC’s “Lodge 49"" and HBO’s “Los Espookys.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-on-becoming-a-god-in-central-florida-and-jawline.html

Last year, the film that was shot over the two-night concert there under the direction of Sydney Pollack finally made it to theaters, giving the public the opportunity to see — and not just hear — what happened in that church. The movie also gives plenty of attention to the proceedings’s very qualified host, the Rev. James Cleveland.” “This is obviously one of the great music films, less epic in scope than, say, ‘The Last Waltz’ but as glorious in communal feeling and South Los Angeles zeal as ‘Wattstax’ (the natural partner for a double feature) and as musically imaginative as ‘Stop Making Sense,’” Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The New York Times. “What distinguishes ‘Amazing Grace,’ what lifts it to the penthouse, is a mix of energy and moment.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-amazing-grace-and-the-house.html

My aunt and uncle, who live in Long Island, had gone there on an early date decades ago. My mom and her sister were visiting from out of town. The sets weren’t much longer than 10 to 15 minutes, and there must have been four or maybe five comedians in total. None of them were of Asian descent, and yet almost immediately, the Asian jokes started: Asians are bad drivers. Asian men are undesirable. Asian men have small penises. Asian women are good in bed because they’re small and docile. My discomfort was palpable. I was disappointed in what I was witnessing, in the laughter I was hearing around us, but I also wasn’t surprised.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/t-magazine/asian-american-comedians.html

2019-08-26,The Divine Resurrection of Stained Glass,"IT WAS THE 19TH-CENTURY designer-cum-social-activist William Morris who first brought stained glass back from the dead. Dismayed by the mass production of the Industrial Revolution, he intended his Arts and Crafts movement to encourage a return to traditional techniques and materials. Stained glass — made then and now with sand, potash (mined potassium salts) and metallic oxides for color, heated to 3,000 degrees to create sheets, then sliced into shapes and soldered together with lead, zinc, copper or iron — was primed for resurrection. Though ubiquitous in churches since the High Middle Ages, when stained-glass windows taught the congregation Bible stories through imagery, it waned with the rise of unadorned Protestantism in the late 17th century. Morris made panes fashionable in the houses of the Victorian era, in shades of aquamarine, Kelly green and tangerine, to filter whatever sun could be found — a literal and figurative embodiment of enlightenment and, too, a canvas for his medieval motifs.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/t-magazine/stained-glass.html

Why, when there’s a heroic warrior involved, does the dragon always need to be the bad guy?

The latest and supposedly final installment in the series sees Hiccup and Toothless dealing with a new foe: a vicious dragon hunter voiced by F. Murray Abraham. “If you’ve spent any time with these characters,” Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times, “it’s hard not to get swept up in the saga, and it’s easy to be moved by the bond between Hiccup and Toothless, who is, in effect, a very loyal dog who can fly and harness the power of lightning bolts.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-how-to-train-your-dragon-and-the-real-oz.html

Just make a few calls, put out some food and something to drink, light a couple of candles and allow everyone to gather as if you won’t see them for a year. Embrace the symbolism.

He interrupts her: “Shut up. Shut uuuuuuuup.” Then he leans in and asks, “What do you want right this second?” The answer is obvious. The two run giddily into the “boom boom room,” the only semiprivate place in the house where the contestants live for 10 weeks. The rest of the house loses it, cheering and crowding around the door to listen to their muffled moans.

Alex is also the vice president of technology for the Bronx Science chapter of the National Honor Society, the director of graphics and marketing for TeenHacks L.I.

They were given the opportunity to take classes at an on-site sale and trade school; their lunchtime hours would be filled with speeches or performances from visiting dignitaries (actors, musicians, poets); and they would receive a substantial pension upon retirement. They would be housed, if they liked, in Olivetti-constructed modern homes and apartments. Their children would receive free day care, and expecting mothers would be granted 10 months maternity leave. July would be a time of holiday, so that workers with homes in the surrounding countryside could tend to small farms — it was important to the company that workers not feel a division between city and country.

Since then, Party, who is 39 and best known for his surrealist canvases done in soft pastels — from portraits of blue- and green-faced people with blank expressions to moody still lifes and landscapes (in one, a pair of trees stretch toward the moon like houseplants in want of the sun) — has made these unusual dinners an important part of his practice.

They center on female embodiment as well as the ways that race and gender can shape how we form our identities. Both explore, in accessible black and white, the everyday experience of feeling like an other, making that feeling — whether in relation to one’s peers or one’s own offspring — vivid and resonant on the page.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/books/review/hot-comb-ebony-flowers-dear-scarlet-teresa-wong.html

You can’t make this stuff up: In the early 1990s, the biographer Lee Israel hit a bump in the road. Her latest book had failed to sell, and her agent told her to find another way of making a living. Then Israel stumbled upon a letter by the vaudeville comedian Fanny Brice and sold it to a bookshop. After learning that such writings would be worth more if they had meatier content, Israel went on to forge and sell roughly 400 missives by dead writers. Her crime spree is retold in this engrossing dramedy, based on Israel’s memoir. Melissa McCarthy stars as the crabby, whiskey-guzzling literary forger alongside Richard E. Grant, who plays her free-spirited drinking buddy and accomplice Jack Hock. Both actors earned Oscar nominations for their performances. And though the characters have questionable morals, they’re a joy to watch.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-can-you-ever-forgive-me-and-the-jungle-book.html
