The data showed a modest decline in homicides in 2012, the first in six years. Mexico’s census agency, compiling reports of murders from the 32 federal entities, said there were 26,037 homicides last year, a 4.3 percent decline from 27,213 in 2011, which was the most in recent years. The homicide rate was 22 per 100,000 residents, a decline from 24 per 100,000 the previous year. The homicide rate in the United States is 4.7 per 100,000 people, according to United Nations figures, but Mexico’s rate was far lower than several other countries in the hemisphere. A number of analysts believe this data provides a good barometer of overall violence, which had surged because of infighting among criminal gangs and the government’s efforts to suppress them. In 2007, there were 8,867 homicides, the lowest number in the last six years. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/americas/a-modest-decline-of-homicides-in-mexico.html

2013-08-02,How Soon It May Be Too Late,"Death was early American photography’s killer app. Since the first pictures required long exposures, it was convenient to have a subject that held still. There was a psychological angle as well. A 19th-­century photographer reported that when he visited a town in upstate New York, all the residents welcomed him except the blacksmith, who at first reviled him as a swindler. But then the blacksmith’s son drowned — and the blacksmith came begging for an image of the boy. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/mathew-brady-by-robert-wilson.html

They scattered in a hurry all those years ago, on an afternoon in June, after a run of “great” performances (admittedly, standards were low: they knew fewer than 10 songs). Thirty years later they’ve reassembled in Oakpine, Wyo., the fictional setting of Ron Carlson’s fifth novel, “Return to Oakpine.” Their hometown is sweetly, stubbornly sunk for all time in the “Leave It to Beaver” 1950s. Even in ’69 there was no hint of peace songs or race riots or long hair on the men. In ’99 the town seems to know little of manufactured drugs, the tech boom or Y2K. During high school football home games, Oakpine is “as deserted as a town in a movie about the end of the world, not a noise except for the train every two hours.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/ron-carlsons-return-to-oakpine.html

While the early stuff continued to attract admirers (including Jonathan Franzen, who called Purdy’s 1967 novel “Eustace Chisholm and the Works” “so good that almost any novel you read immediately after it will seem at least a little bit posturing, or dishonest, or self-­admiring”), he drew diminishing interest both from American publishers, who took on his later books only after they were published overseas, and from reviewers, who often ignored them entirely.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/the-complete-short-stories-of-james-purdy.html

The driver, Francisco José Garzón Amo, had answered a ticket inspector’s call on his cellphone and was traveling at a permitted speed of 199 kilometers per hour, or 123 miles per hour, before the train switched to another track in a reduced-speed zone. During the call, an alarm went off in the driver’s cabin. The black boxes recorded Mr. Garzón screaming as he tried to activate the brake. The train’s speed dropped to 195 k.p.h., or 121 m.p.h., but another alarm sounded, 500 yards from the curve where the accident took place. Mr. Garzón activated an emergency brake three seconds later. A third alarm sounded, and 13 train cars started derailing. Mr. Garzón activated another emergency brake as the train careened from the tracks and then slammed into a wall at 153 k.p.h., or 95 m.p.h., nearly twice the speed limit. Mr. Garzón was arrested last week and charged with reckless homicide in the deaths of 79 people.

(Cinemax) CHASING MAVERICKS (2012) Rick Hesson (Gerard Butler), a surfer in Santa Cruz nicknamed Frosty, teaches Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston, above right, with Mr. Butler), a legend-in-the-making with a dream and a battered board, the way of the waves — specifically, the monster crushers in Northern California on a break known as Mavericks. Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted shared the directing duties on this film, based on a true story that begins in 1987 and is lent authenticity by the real-life surfers Greg Long, Peter Mel and Zach Wormhoudt. “When the movie works, its buoyancy can be infectious and persuasive, particularly in the surfing scenes and in the mesmerizing shots of the heaving, churning ocean and waves,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York York Times. “The movie captures the hypnotic quality of this watery landscape, with its steel blue undulations and the Freudian oceanic feeling it summons. It invites you to gaze into this watery abyss, to ponder its mysteries as well as those of the swimmer whose image brackets the movie and evokes John F. Kennedy’s observation: ‘We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch, we are going back from whence we came.’ ” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Marion’s father (played by Ms. Delpy’s father, Albert) is detained at the airport for trying to enter the United States with cheese and sausage taped to his body; her sister (Alexia Landeau) and her sister’s boyfriend (Alex Nahon) smoke weed in an elevator and have noisy sex in the bathroom, possibly involving Mingus’s electric toothbrush. “The driving crazy part is hilarious and persuasive, partly because Ms. Delpy and her cast depart from the usual caricatures of Frenchness while still engaging in broad, silly satire,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And although Marion and Mingus “never quite seem like a credible, comfortable couple,” he added, the film’s best parts “are those that cast an affectionate, unsentimental eye on the city, which looks lived-in, real and nonmythical, the way that Paris often looks in French movies and New York rarely does in Hollywood confections.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2013-08-05,Samuel Beckett at 59E59 Theaters,"Trevor Nunn’s well-received 2012 stage adaptation of the haunting Samuel Beckett radio play “All That Fall,” starring Eileen Atkins and Michael Gambon, will be presented in New York at the end of the year, following runs at two London theaters last fall. The show, a highlight of the coming season at 59E59 Theaters, features a deceptively simple plot: A woman heads to meet her blind husband at a train station. But this is Beckett, after all, and the story turns out to be more of a tragicomic meditation on life and death. Mr. Nunn’s production, because of restrictions set by the Beckett estate, is presented in the form of a live radio play, with actors holding scripts and using minimal props. The 2013-14 season at 59E59 Theaters, to be announced on Monday, is also to include “I Can See Clearly Now (The Wheelchair on My Face)” (Sept. 10 to 29), a solo show written and performed by Sonya Kelly, courtesy of the Dublin company Fishamble: The New Play Company; “Witnessed by the World” (Nov. 7 to Dec. 15), a play by Ronnie Cohen and Jane Beale, starring Tovah Feldshuh as a journalist fixated on the assassination of John F. Kennedy; Squonk Opera’s surreal meditation on the visualization of music, “Mayhem and Majesty” (Dec. 10 to 29); and “Beertown” (Jan. 30 to Feb. 16), about a town’s time capsule. “All That Fall” is scheduled to run Nov. 5 to Dec. 8 at 59E59 Theaters, which also produces the annual “Brits Off Broadway” festival, planned for April 1 to June 29.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/theater/samuel-beckett-at-59e59-theaters.html

2013-08-06,What’s on Tuesday,"6:50 A.M. (Cinemax) MATCH POINT (2005) Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish tennis player recently retired from the professional circuit, climbs the British social ladder after taking a job at a London club, helping its rich members polish their strokes. Soon, he has befriended Tom (Matthew Goode), an heir to a business fortune; has wooed his sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer); and maneuvered himself into the family firm and into the family as Tom’s brother-in-law. But then Chris meets Tom’s fiancée, a scrappy American actress, Nola (Scarlett Johansson, above, with Mr. Rhys Meyers), and suddenly the temperature of his life increases from a polite simmer to a full sexual boil. “What passes between Chris and Nola is not only desire, but also recognition, which makes their connection especially volatile,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, describing this drama as “a Champagne cocktail laced with strychnine.” He added: “As their affair advances, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Rhys Meyers manage some of the best acting seen in a Woody Allen movie in a long time, escaping the archness and emotional disconnection that his writing often imposes. It is possible to identify with both of them — and to feel an empathetic twinge as they are ensnared in the consequences of their own heedlessness — without entirely liking either one. But it is the film’s brisk, chilly precision that makes it so bracingly pleasurable. The gloom of random, meaningless existence has rarely been so much fun, and Mr. Allen’s bite has never been so sharp, or so deep. A movie this good is no laughing matter.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

Last night, in the high-class-bordello setting of the Midtown supper club 54 Below, Szot, kicking off a weeklong stint there, captured several more hearts… of a certain age. Szot, who has a booming operatic voice and is built like a massive rectangle, swashbuckled into the room from the back, schmoozing his way to a stage where a jazz trio awaited him. Even amid his opening number, a playful mash-up of “Summertime” and “Too Darn Hot,” many a well-heeled matron shrieked or moaned aloud for him.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/after-hours-paulo-szots-outsize-broadway-grandeur/

2013-08-07,"With Cooked Tomatoes, Stick With Cool Reds or Rosé","Raw tomatoes, high in acid, demand high-acid wines. But cooked-tomato dishes like this crostata are altogether mellower, and so welcome a wider range of wines. A high-acid wine like an unoaked barbera from Asti or Alba would still go beautifully, but so would a Sicilian nerello mascalese from Mount Etna or a good Provençal rosé. Serve the reds cool. White wines would work well, too, like a falanghina or fiano di Avellino from Campania, or a good sauvignon blanc on the herbal side. Personally, because I imagine the flavors of this crostata as broad rather than sharp, I would probably stick with reds or rosé. Other red options include Beaujolais, lighter pinot noirs like those from Sancerre or the range of light reds from northern Italy, like teroldego, lagrein, grignolino and those from the Valle d’Aosta. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/dining/with-cooked-tomatoes-stick-with-cool-reds-or-rose.html

2013-08-07,What’s on Wednesday,"9 P.M. (BET) LUV (2013) A recent parolee (the rapper Common) dreaming of a better life decides to take his 11-year-old nephew (Michael Rainey Jr., above left, with Common) out of school for a day and teach him how to be a man in this crime thriller from the director Sheldon Candis. But as the boy eats his first oyster, tastes his first beer and learns how to steer a car, he also ends up being an accomplice — and perhaps a hostage — to a man who turns out to be a desperate criminal. “Mr. Candis, who wrote the script with Justin Wilson, balances the more sensationalistic aspects of the movie — guns are pointed and fired, blood is shed, and threats are issued with heavy, macho menace — with keen attention to details of character and place,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The landscape of Baltimore’s African-American neighborhoods may be familiar to fans of ‘The Wire’ (as will the faces of a few of the actors), but ‘Luv’ is telling a different kind of tale about drugs, the law and urban life. It is, as the title suggests, a love story, focused on the complicated bonds between men who regard one another as family and whose lives are scarred and shadowed by violence.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Now, with artisanal bread a staple in many homes, the breadbox is poised for a revival. Wesco, a German company, has reintroduced its Bauhaus-style Grandy model, designed in 1946 by Josef Neuhaus. Made of powder-coated steel, it has ventilation holes in the back, nonslip feet and a metal handle and hinges. The 16-inch-wide box comes in a glossy apple red from the Museum of Modern Art store, for $100.

On July 19, a federal appeals court ruled that Mr. Risen must testify in the criminal trial of a former C.I.A. official, Jeffrey Sterling, who is charged with leaking classified information. The case involves material published in Mr. Risen’s 2006 book, “State of War.” The ruling came a week after Mr. Holder released a report on “significant revisions” to Justice Department policies intended to “strengthen protections for members of the news media.” The amended guidelines call for tactics like subpoenas to be treated as “extraordinary measures” to be used as a “last resort,” noted David N. Kelley, Mr. Risen’s lawyer, in a letter to Mr. Holder. “We urge you to apply those principles to this case,” Mr. Kelley wrote.

He hadn’t produced a hit since John Lennon’s “Imagine” in 1971, and the Ramones, who had released four critically acclaimed albums of exuberant punk rock, were still searching for a commercial breakthrough. The sessions for the resulting album, “End of the Century,” were tumultuous, and the opening pages of the new book, “Gabba Gabba Hey!: The Graphic Story of the Ramones,” written by Jim McCarthy and illustrated by Brian Williamson, details some of Mr. Spector’s more notorious moments: forcing the guitarist Johnny Ramone to play the opening chord to “Rock ’N’ Roll High School” more than 70 times; pointing a gun at the bassist Dee Dee Ramone.

And all three dig into the reality behind the facade of the American dream: namely, that there is no glory in being a blue-collar grunt in this country, that to be working class is to live a tenuous existence, one in which the authors and half the people they know are one misstep away from surfing garage-sale sofas in other people’s living rooms.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/books/review/justin-st-germains-son-of-a-gun.html

Disguised as a young man, braving frostbite and Russian missiles, she reported back to English newspapers and television on the American-backed mujahedeen, who were importing, as she put it, “a brand of extremist political Islam that . . . had been almost unknown inside Afghanistan.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/books/review/saira-shahs-mouse-proof-kitchen.html

Thetis, so legend runs, submerged Achilles in the River Styx to inoculate him from harm but neglected to dip the back of the ankle by which she held him fast.

They both address the inadequacy of language to articulate reality. Better to say nothing, they both say, or at least that’s the first half of what they say. If Adorno leaves off the productive half of the equation — “I’ll go on” — other writers have supplied it for him, in the form of a very large body of work concerned with the Holocaust that is not only ethically accountable but also incredibly rich and inventive. In fact it is not too much to claim, of Holocaust literature, that the struggle to say what is unsayable has paradoxically yielded some of the most extraordinary literary works we have.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/books/review/dossier-k-by-imre-kertesz.html

When you do that, you see the problems and solutions very differently. Environmentalists always start by thinking about the health of the “commons” — the shared air, soil, forests and water — that are the basis of all life, which, if not preserved, will undermine the whole society. The notion that securing the interests of any single group — Shiite or Sunni, Christian or Muslim, secular or Islamist — over the health of the commons is nuts to them.

2013-08-12,What’s On Sunday,"10 P.M. (AMC) LOW WINTER SUN Frank Agnew (Mark Strong), a Detroit homicide detective with a tragic past, is persuaded by a colleague, Joe Geddes (Lennie James, above), to help him kill another cop, who he claims murdered a loved one of Frank’s. But as holes surface in Joe’s story, Frank starts to worry that he has been played in this new series, based on a 2006 British mini-series of the same title. Ruben Santiago-Hudson portrays the precinct commander, who assigns Frank to lead the investigation into the cop’s death. David Costabile is an Internal Affairs detective delving into corruption. And James Ransone is a thug who, with his wife (Sprague Grayden), and a police officer on his payroll, looks to set up a drug and prostitution business. “It’s a deadly serious drama, but some of the early scenes are so overwrought that they are almost laughable,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The series, she said, “doesn’t need to overreach. It has an intriguing story, an aptly sinister setting and an excellent cast.” She added: “It’s inevitable for viewers to yearn for the kind of odyssey that series like ‘The Wire’ and ‘Breaking Bad’ provided. ‘Low Winter Sun’ isn’t that, but it’s an entertaining way station.” The fifth, and final, season premiere of “Breaking Bad” leads in at 9. “Talking Bad,” a companion show hosted by Chris Hardwick that analyzes the series’s last eight episodes, follows at 11.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/arts/whats-on-sunday.html

She was accompanied by four instrumentalists playing cello, percussion, various flutes and clarinets, all members of the International Contemporary Ensemble, known as ICE.

But what happens when you add chile’s heat, to say nothing of nomadic travelers in the wine world like tomatillo and pineapple? Not to worry. The char of the meat will still be the dominant flavor, though amplified and augmented by the additions. I recommend a dry Loire red, like one of the less-structured Chinons, Bourgueils or Saumur-Champignys. Unless they are too tannic, they seem to have an affinity for chiles. What’s more, their fruit, spice and acidity will take naturally to the fruitiness of the tomatillo, pineapple and, indeed, the chile. Other options: cru Beaujolais and West Coast gamays, if you can find them; lighter-bodied Ribeira Sacra and Bierzos, made from the mencía grape; and Austrian blaufränkisches and zweigelts. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/wines-to-accompany-grilled-flank-steak.html

She was fluent in six languages, which served her well when she later became a spy for the Italian resistance during World War II — until she was thrown in a Nazi concentration camp. In his new biography, “The Many Lives of Miss K.,” Jean-Noël Liaut likens the secretive Koopman to “a squid hiding behind its cloud of ink.” Though she was never monogamous — she took lovers into her 70s, including the actress Tallulah Bankhead, Winston Churchill‘s son Randolph and the press baron Lord Beaverbrook — she devoted the second half of her life to Erica Brausen, the visionary art dealer, who, with Koopman’s help, launched Francis Bacon’s career from her Hanover Gallery in London.

Friedman used to hang out at Tosca when he worked for the concert promoter Bill Graham, mixing with local power players like former Mayor Willie Brown and Gov. Jerry Brown. In fact, generations of cultural figures ranging from Hunter S. Thompson to Sam Shepard to Johnny Depp have gathered within Tosca’s muraled walls to swap stories and make deals, often over the “house cappuccino” — a variation on Irish coffee made with cocoa and brandy that was invented there during Prohibition. “There was always opera on the jukebox, and I remember the drinks being better than they actually were,” Friedman said. “From Sean’s text on, it was, ‘Let’s save Tosca from becoming a Subway shop or a whiskey bar.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/by-design-a-second-act-for-a-legendary-san-francisco-watering-hole/

The consensus in these pieces is that Aslan’s book makes a hash of more careful scholarship on its way to preordained conclusions, and that his portrait of Jesus as a political revolutionary is just another predictable example of the way that the Nazarene’s contemporary biographers almost aways produce (as The Nation’s reviewer puts it) “theological Rorschach tests that tell us far more about those who create them than about the elusive historical Jesus.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/in-defense-of-reza-aslan/

At La Dame de Pic, her year-old restaurant in Paris, the dishes are light and delicate, and each menu comes with a perfume strip to evoke the various flavors of the meal. In her new cookbook, ‘‘Le Livre Blanc’’ (her first in English, available Sept. 1), she features recipes like Normandy scallops topped with a ‘‘sunset’’ of rose petals and radicchio and crab topped with Chinese white-jasmine tea foam, which are accompanied by lovely, spare photographs. It’s as much an art book as a practical guide; Pic explained that she doesn’t expect home cooks to replicate her recipes — after all, who has gariguette strawberries in the fridge? ‘‘But,” she added, “I will be very happy if they were inspired by my associations of taste.’’",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/food-matters-the-cookbook-not-meant-for-home-cooks/

Ms. Oh, who was nominated for five Emmy Awards as Dr. Yang, has played one of the show’s most consistently popular characters. Her decision to leave comes early, which should make it easier for the show’s creator, Shonda Rhimes, to write the character off the show. But there is a chance Ms. Oh will not be the only departure. Most of the show’s regulars, including Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey, Chandra Wilson and James Pickens Jr., have contracts that end after the coming season. ABC released a statement saying, “It’s our intention to have ‘Grey’s’ on the air for many years to come, with as many of the original cast as possible.” The network has good reason to push for further seasons: the series remains ABC’s highest-rated drama, though its numbers have fallen in recent years from its days as a prime-time phenomenon.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/arts/television/sandra-oh-to-leave-greys-anatomy.html

In a report issued on Wednesday, the Commission on Accountability and Policy for Religious Organizations said the ban inhibits free speech, is confusing and is enforced inconsistently by the Internal Revenue Service. A minority report written by some of the 66 religious leaders advising the commission disagreed and supported keeping the prohibition. The commission was convened by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, initially to recommend ways to prevent financial corruption in religious ministries investigated for misusing donations.

2013-08-15,What’s on Thursday,"4:15 P.M. (Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. “Same person, no difference at all,” she says, unflustered. “Just a different sex.” She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women — as well as their similarities — in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlando’s female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. “This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “Throughout Ms. Potter’s ‘Orlando,’ as in Woolf’s, there are a piercing kind of common sense and a joy that, because they are so rare these days in any medium, create their own kind of cinematic suspense and delightedly surprised laughter. ‘Orlando’ could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory.” More than anything else, he added: “ ‘Orlando’ is Ms. Swinton’s triumph. With the firmest but lightest of touches, she has spun gossamer.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

But knowing, sophisticated attempts to replicate those things often traffic in their own kind of snobbery, confusing condescension with authenticity.

René Pape plays the wise knight Gurnemanz; Katarina Dalayman (on the ground above, next to Mr. Kaufmann and in front of Mr. Pape) is the wayward temptress Kundry; Peter Mattei is the wounded king Amfortas; and Evgeny Nikitin is the evil wizard Klingsor. Daniele Gatti conducts this coproduction with Opéra National de Lyon and the Canadian Opera Company, presented in two parts by “Great Performances at the Met.” “The gloominess of this production can become oppressive,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in a New York Times review in February. Still, “there is much to admire in Mr. Girard’s thoughtful and intrepid staging, full of striking imagery.” The Met, he added, “has assembled about the best ‘Parsifal’ cast available today,” while Mr. Gatti “draws diaphanous playing from the great Met orchestra and captures the shifting currents of this richly chromatic and complex score.” Part 2 will be broadcast next Friday at 9.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

Hall switched to water as his filler. And he decided to build a mattress instead of a chair; since people rarely move their beds, the weight wouldn’t matter so much.

Nearly 150 years later, Evelyn Toynton, writing about “Jesus: A Life” for the Book Review in 1992, said A. N. Wilson’s study “does not pretend to add much to the scholarship on the subject.” According to Toynton’s reading, Wilson, like Aslan, argued that Jesus “never saw himself as anything but a Jew or desired any following among the gentiles,” and “was crucified as a terrorist, not as a religious figure.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/books/review/jesus-under-the-microscope.html

They meet in condemned buildings marked by the symbol of a stylized eye to watch a “night film” — one of the psychologically punishing horror pictures of Stanislas Cordova, a master filmmaker who has shunned publicity with a zeal that makes Thomas Pynchon look like a shameless attention hog. Adding to the mystique is a sense that Cordova might have retreated because he has something unsavory to hide. Bad things happen to those who try to pick his locked closet for a look at the skeletons. Consider the star reporter Scott McGrath, who plunged into disgrace after a preliminary investigation into Cordova’s secrets blew up in his face. McGrath has a score to settle, so when Cordova’s achingly gifted daughter turns up dead in a Manhattan ruin, it’s Take 2 for the unemployed journalist. Nor is McGrath the only one who wants to know what’s been going on behind the camera; in short order he’s joined by a shabby but smoldering drug dealer named Hopper and a breathless ingénue, Nora Halliday. Together, the three make an adorably awkward family of misfits, who will be even more appealing should George Clooney, Ryan Gosling and Alison Brie be cast for the movie adaptation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/books/review/night-film-by-marisha-pessl.html

Far from slight, they all deal with large themes and subjects that could easily fill 500-page books, yet have been compressed into poemlike works. Page count is one of the most prosaic ways to categorize a book, but it points to the fact that one approaches these works differently — the experience more akin to reading poetry or short fiction, where what is left out is at least as important as what remains.

The essays’ titles mirror or refract one another, imparting symmetry. The summit, a chapter titled “Knot,” evokes another of the book’s metaphors, the bringing together of narrative threads. The tipped mountain shape resembles the traditional rise and fall of story structure. But this isn’t the only visual conceit. “Imagine all the sentences in this book as a single thread around the spool that is a book,” Solnit writes.

Despite these successes, Rosso’s life is in many ways very small.

A rainstorm impeded their ascent, making the road “exceedingly steep, slippery, and winding.” As they labored upward, the soldiers were enveloped by a dense fog. Suddenly, as they approached the top of the mountain, they found themselves entirely above the clouds, looking down, Campbell wrote, on “one of the grandest sights I ever witnessed.” Bright sunlight poured through the rain, creating “hundreds of rain bows on the sides of the mountains beneath us.” The 18-year-old Hoosier struggled to convey in words a sublime spectacle “that no pen could describe.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/across-the-cumberlands/

About 575 people were rescued by government vessels and small fishing boats by early Saturday, Petty Officer Joy Villegas of the Philippine Coast Guard said in a phone interview. Hundreds of people were still thought to be missing. The ferry, St. Thomas of Aquinas, was not far from shore off the island of Cebu when it collided with the cargo boat Sulpicio Express 7. “The incident was visible from the shoreline, so it was easier to respond and conduct search and rescue,” Petty Officer Villegas said. Survivors interviewed on local television said that when the ferry began listing, panicked passengers raced to the deck and leapt into the ocean as it sank.

2013-08-19,What’s on Saturday,"7:30 P.M. (HBO) ANNA KARENINA (2012) Keira Knightley, above, stars as Anna, the bored wife of a virtuous government official (Jude Law) in mid-19th-century Imperial Russia, who travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her philandering brother (Matthew Macfadyen) in Joe Wright’s stagy adaptation of the Tolstoy novel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the man who captures her heart: Count Vronsky, a young military officer with the eyes of a poet and a domineering mother (Olivia Williams). And Alicia Vikander is Kitty, a lovely young woman adored by Levin, the gloomy rural landowner (Domhnall Gleeson) widely understood to be Tolstoy’s alter ego, with his idea of love — an ennobling union of souls — serving as a rebuke to the amorality festering in cities. “I assume you know that it ends badly, but Mr. Wright’s real interest, like Tolstoy’s, is in everything that happens in between Anna’s first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. And while Mr. Wright’s screen versions of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” and Ian McEwan’s “Atonement” “remain trapped in literariness,” he added, “Mr. Wright’s ‘Anna Karenina’ is different. It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly — wonderfully — crazy terms. Pious Tolstoyans may knit their brows about the stylistic liberties Mr. Wright and the screenwriter, Tom Stoppard, have taken, but surely Tolstoy can withstand (and may indeed benefit from) their playful, passionate rendering of his masterpiece.” Jacqueline Durran won an Oscar for costume design.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-08-19,What’s On Sunday,"9 P.M. (13, 49) THE LADY VANISHES In this “Masterpiece Mystery!” movie, based on Ethel Lina White’s 1936 novel, “The Wheel Spins,” from which Alfred Hitchcock adapted his 1938 thriller, “The Lady Vanishes,” Iris Carr (Tuppence Middleton, above, with Tom Hughes), a beautiful young socialite, is befriended on a train by an older Englishwoman named Miss Froy (Selina Cadell), who then disappears — after which Iris’s fellow passengers deny she ever existed. Only Max Hare (Mr. Hughes), the infatuated engineer, pays heed to Iris’s conviction. Is it fair to compare this film with Hitchcock’s? Mike Hale asked in The New York Times. “It doesn’t really matter, because if you’ve seen the original, it’s impossible to do otherwise,” he decided. “This new ‘Lady Vanishes,’ directed by Diarmuid Lawrence (‘South Riding’) from a screenplay by Fiona Seres, is a perfectly adequate television mystery of the week. But it forgoes the crackling pace, light touch and surprisingly sophisticated sexual banter of the original, opting for melancholy, ominousness and sentimentality.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/arts/whats-on-sunday.html

2013-08-20,What’s On Tuesday,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE PLAYER (1992) In this film directed by Robert Altman, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), the head of production at a large Hollywood studio, tries to fend off a young genius (Peter Gallagher) rumored to have been hired as his replacement while figuring out who is writing him poison-pen postcards. When the hate mail’s author — a screenwriter (Vincent D’Onofrio) Griffin failed to get back to — turns up dead, he becomes a suspect, partly for falling in love with the writer’s girlfriend (Greta Scacchi, above, with Mr. Robbins). Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. “As a satire, ‘The Player’ tickles,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “It doesn’t draw blood.” Mr. Altman’s most subversive message, he added, “is not that it’s possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.” In “Short Cuts” (1993), at 10:15, Mr. Altman intertwines the experiences of Los Angelenos in adaptations of Raymond Carver stories. Mr. Robbins reappears as a philandering motorcycle cop who can’t be faithful to the woman (Frances McDormand) with whom he’s cheating on his wife (Madeleine Stowe). Lily Tomlin is a diner cook who hits a small boy with her car. Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell are his parents; Mr. Lovett is the baker who makes his birthday cake. Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis are three pals who find a dead woman while fishing. And Jennifer Jason Leigh is a mother who supports her family by doing phone sex, sometimes while washing dishes or changing diapers. “The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done,” Mr. Canby wrote. “When future social historians want to know what the temper of life was like in one corner of America in 1993, ‘Short Cuts’ will be a mother lode of information. It’s also a terrific movie.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

These usually consist of three or four different types of frittata and they are different from the stack of thin frittatas that I learned to make years ago. Traditionally you would make these simply by making the frittatas, leaving them a little runny on the top and stacking them, then finishing the stack in the oven or just weighting it with a plate and chilling. But it’s easier and faster (though still quite time consuming) if you’re making the crespéu in a breadpan or tureen to cook the eggs and filling like runny scrambled eggs and layer each batch in a breadpan, then bake in a water bath.

You can do this purely with taxes, via a single-payer system (and maybe even by having the government act as provider), or you can do it, Swiss or Massachusetts style, via a combination of regulation, taxes, and subsidies.

Known for most of its history as Smyrna, this port city was, in Ottoman times, a melting pot that included Greeks, Armenians, Jews, French and Italians. Today’s Izmir is largely Turkish, but the moniker lingers. For religious Turks, the label seems appropriate for this sunny, palm-fringed seaside city, with its relaxed attitudes and many nonobservant Muslims. For most residents, though, the nickname is proof of Izmir’s progressiveness. Reverential images of Ataturk, the founder of modern secular Turkey, are everywhere, and in June many in the city protested against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after his Islamist-inspired government cracked down on peaceful demonstrators in Istanbul who had mobilized to save a city park from developers. Izmir — which is among four international cities that are vying to hold the World Expo in 2020 — has much to offer visitors: a renovated waterfront, an ever-evolving night-life district and slick new design hotels.

The ambassador, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, frequently criticized the agency, the nuclear monitoring arm of the United Nations, as well as what he views as Western bias against Iran. Mr. Rouhani, who took office this month, has vowed to pursue a more flexible approach toward resolving the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program, which many countries suspect is aimed at giving it the capability to produce nuclear weapons, despite Iranian denials. Last Friday Mr. Rouhani replaced the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, which runs the country’s nuclear facilities. On Tuesday state news media signaled that negotiations over the nuclear program would now be handled by Mr. Rouhani’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, an American-educated diplomat.

The swan was one of about 200 that live on Baths Island and belong to the queen. Until 1998, under a law dating to the 12th century, killing or injuring a swan was classified as treason, and the crown retains ownership of all unmarked mute swans in areas along the River Thames. Wild swans are also protected under a 1981 act, and to injure or kill a swan — let alone eat one — is against the law. Wendy Hermon of Swan Lifeline said that “the whole breast had been removed, and it looked like it had been eaten for lunch.” There was “just a swan skeleton left,” she said. “It’s absolutely disgusting, I can’t imagine the kind of people that would do this.” She said the carcass, with its feathers still attached, was taken by her group to be cremated.

The men are warriors, street fighters with furious fists and winged feet, who have massed together on a dark, rainy night to take on Ip Man (Tony Leung), a still figure in a long coat and an elegant white hat. Even amid the violent whirlpools of rain and bodies, that hat never leaves his head. It’s as unyielding as its owner.

He follows the stories of several retired N.F.L. players, living and dead, who had the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has been linked to repetitive blows to the head.

These aren’t like the strays who anxiously drift through other contemporary American movies — whose lack of purpose is reflected both in the groping camerawork and the uncertainty of a budding filmmaker behind the camera. The young director of “Short Term 12,” Destin Daniel Cretton, may have adapted some of the techniques of low-budget independent features, including a suggestion of tentativeness in the hand-held cinematography. But he’s clearly thought through his choices and found a subject that has earned its heartache. ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/movies/short-term-12-delves-into-life-at-a-group-home.html

(Flix) WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER (2001) On the last day of the summer in 1981, Coop (Michael Showalter), a teenage counselor at Camp Firewood, outside Waterville, Me., decides that he will finally declare his love for his lifelong crush, Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Meanwhile, the camp’s director, Beth (Janeane Garofalo), has romantic designs of her own on Associate Professor Newman (David Hyde Pierce). This comedy — directed by David Wain, written by Mr. Showalter and Mr. Wain, and with an ensemble cast including Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Paul Rudd and Christopher Meloni (above, center, with Mr. Showalter, left, and A. D. Miles) — is “at its best when it jettisons parody for off-the-cuff zaniness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times.

2013-08-23,"Jimmy Connors, Ladies’ Man","Technically, Jimmy Connors wasn’t the most overwhelming player. He was on the slight side; his serve was so-so, his forehand questionable. His only truly great stroke was his two-handed backhand. That he managed to win eight Grand Slam events (five U.S. Opens, two Wimbledons and one Australian Open), spend 160 consecutive weeks at No. 1 (1974-77) and rack up a record 109 career singles titles (John McEnroe and Roger Federer each have 77; Rafael Nadal has 58) is a testament, in large part, to a relentless and, at times, all-consuming will. This trait goes a long way toward explaining Connors’s most quietly astounding feat: for 16 years, he held a Top 10 ranking. In an era when tennis careers can flame out over a half-dozen seasons, Connors — who on his 39th birthday won a fourth-round U.S. Open match against the 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein in 4 hours 41 minutes — looks, in retrospect, more and more like a freak of nature or nurture or both.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/magazine/jimmy-connors-ladies-man.html

An early mention can be traced to a 1649 satirical French poem, which features the Frères Pique-nicques, known for visiting friends “armed with bottles and dishes.” In 1802, the term made a hop to Britain after a group of Francophiles in London formed a Pic-Nic Society to gorge, guzzle and perform amateur theatricals. Participants drew lots to determine who would supply which dish — from calf’s-foot jelly to blancmange. “Depending on your luck,” Levy says, “you might have to bring something expensive, like pie made from truffles.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/magazine/who-made-that-picnic.html

Meeting in the metro was a Russian tradition, and like Russia itself it seemed exotic, romantic and rife with drama. I arrived in tears to several of my own rendezvous because of confusion over the Cyrillic-only metro signs, and I missed others entirely.

But there’s something about those uncomfortable years that draws me, like many adults, back to them — at least as a reader. The perspective of these novels is subtle enough to be engrossing for both teenagers and adults for whom high school’s intense friendships and antipathies still resonate. And how could they not?

As for Captain Marvelous, he seemed like a vanilla remake — a rip-off, really — of Superman, from the big red “M” on his chest to his ruby red cape and captaincy of the Legion of Justice. I am an authority on the Man of Steel, having written a full-fledged biography of him. “I know Superman, Superman is a friend of mine,” I was tempted to write to the author, John David Anderson, “and Mr. Anderson, Captain Marvelous is no Superman!”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/books/review/sidekicked-by-john-david-anderson.html

But most children’s books that convey a sense of family history and tradition — “All-of-a-Kind Family,” “Little House in the Big Woods” — are written with the older child in mind. Younger children are more likely to learn the day-to-day habits of rabbits, monkeys and bears. So it’s refreshing to find three new picture books that take as their subject the stories of human families, illuminating the ways certain rituals — along with sayings, jokes, pastimes and world views — get passed down through the generations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/books/review/this-is-the-rope-by-jacqueline-woodson-and-more.html

But Stakhovsky had played imposing serve-and-volley tennis, a style seldom seen nowadays, and as the fourth set unfolded on Center Court, it became clear that he was not going to succumb to nerves.

They can be tedious listening, and it’s hard to judge what younger generations addicted to on-screen bursts of brevity will make of the 37th president’s schemes and maunderings amid the scandal known as Watergate.

But the traditional Japanese beverage served cold can be a pleasant answer to less-than-comfortable summer nights. A particularly delicious variety that has been popping up at many of New York’s izakayas (the Japanese equivalent to a gastropub) and sake bars recently is the Tokubetsu Junmai from the gourmet sake brewery Nanbu Bijin. Its name translates to “southern beauty,” but Nanbu Bijin is actually located in northern Japan, in a region once controlled by the Nanbu clan of samurai. This junmai — a pure, full-bodied class of premium sake — has a bright, floral bouquet, almost like a lily blossom, and starts crisp before offering a sweet finish almost like honeydew. New Yorkers can find it at Decibel, in the East Village, and Sakagura, near Grand Central Terminal.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/feeling-for-a-sake-thats-perfect-for-summer-sipping/
2013-08-27,‘Heroin Chic’ Beauty for the Office?,"Having always had a soft spot for grunge (for nostalgia reasons, including junior high years spent in a Seattle suburb) and spinoffs thereof, like “heroin chic,” the fall runways with their disgruntled ’90s air felt as familiar as a fuzzy mohair cardigan. In beauty, lip colors were jam-black at some shows (perhaps riffing on Drew Barrymore’s plummy lips during her wild child days), while others interpreted the bare-faced era more literally (slightly greasy skin and stringy hair like Kate Moss’s in the old Calvin Klein ads). But considering that the first time around I was a jobless teenager and that a shiny complexion and unwashed hair is probably not the best combination for the office, I looked to Lloyd Simmonds, creative director of Yves Saint Laurent Makeup, for a few pointers. After all, he had to interpret the very grungy Saint Laurent clothing designed by Hedi Slimane into a viable makeup collection. Here are some snippets from our conversation.

But I thought I would pluck out the following passage, which is an aside in the essay but a suggestive one, I think, in terms of understanding both Bottum’s personal motivations in writing this piece and some of the larger issues in play as well. He’s writing here about anti-Catholicism in American life, and he pauses to note how surprising it would be, from the vantage point of earlier eras and debates, that the church’s attitude toward homosexuality would have ended up giving fuel to an anti-Catholic fire:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/what-joseph-bottum-wants/

2013-08-28,"Holidays, High and Low","With the start of the school year come three Jewish holidays: Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Sukkot. In “What a Way to Start a New Year!” Jacqueline Jules imagines what Rosh Hashana might be like for a young family whose new year is starting in a new house in a new town. Dina, who is about 7, finds nothing is as it should be: the friends she liked to visit for the holiday are now hours away, and her home is a mess of packing boxes. “It doesn’t feel like Rosh Hashana here,” she complains. “We don’t even have a round challah.” A series of mishaps makes the phrase “What a way to start a new year!” a common refrain in the house, until a colleague of Dina’s father suggests the family join him at the temple he attends. Though the holidays are different than Dina remembers, she learns something about making friends and embracing change. Judy Stead’s illustrations, rich with festive pinks, greens and purples, are attractive and cheerful even when her characters’ expressive faces register disappointment or impatience. “What a Way to Start a New Year!” is notable in that Jules assumes a basic understanding of the holiday; making this amusing and less obviously didactic book a pleasure to read.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/books/what-a-way-to-start-a-new-year-and-more.html

2013-08-29,What’s on Thursday,"4:30 P.M. (HBO) GLICKMAN (2013) In 1936, the Bronx-born Marty Glickman, above, a national sprinting champion, earned a spot on the United States Olympic track team as part of the 400-meter relay. But in Berlin, with Hitler in the stands, Mr. Glickman and Sam Stoller — the only Jews on the relay team — were replaced the day before the event by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe, ostensibly because “secret” German runners were expected to challenge for the gold. (Mr. Glickman, who died in 2001, maintained that anti-Semitism was at work.) The Americans won the race; the Germans finished a distant fourth. After returning to the United States, Mr. Glickman eventually found his niche in basketball and football broadcasting. Despite being rejected for a “more Midwestern” announcer when the N.B.A. finally signed a network contract, he became the voice of the Giants during the 1950s and ’60s and the Jets in 1972. This documentary from James L.

2013-08-29,Saving Grace,"Like J. M. Coetzee’s richly symbolic early novels “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Life and Times of Michael K,” his starkly narrated new novel plunges us at once into a mysterious and dreamlike terrain. But where those books evoke Coetzee’s native South Africa and the madness of apartheid, immersing the reader in situations of nearly unbearable intensity, “The Childhood of Jesus” is set in a possibly posthumous limbo in which a haze of forgetfulness has enervated most of the characters, as in a paralyzing smog. We arrive by boat in a city called Novilla, in an unnamed but possibly southern European country, in the company of a man named Simón, who has taken under his protection a child named David — “Not my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him.” It would appear that the travelers are refugees: they have come from a “camp,” a place called Belstar, where they were given Spanish lessons and two passbooks. The child has been separated from his parents. Simón seems to have no family at all. Having, like all his fellow travelers, been shorn of his memory on the voyage to Novilla, Simón arrives in unknown territory and must establish himself; he must find shelter and he must find work to support himself and the boy. If Simón has had a profession or a trade in his former life, he can’t recall it; he is grateful to find work as a stevedore, for which he is barely qualified.

2013-08-30,Pynchon’s Gravitational Pull,"In an essay in the September issue of Harper’s, Jonathan Franzen quotes — at what he concedes is “embarrassing length” — from letters he sent to his fiancée when he was 22. “I recognize Pynchon as my major precursor,” the young, besotted Franzen wrote. “The better he is the more I want to hate him but the less I can.” In an interview with The Paris Review in 2010, Franzen described discovering “Gravity’s Rainbow”: “It was like getting the flu to read that book. It was like I was fighting off some very aggressive infection.” He wrote to his then-fiancée: “I’ll get over Pynchon somehow. Maybe through criticism, some discontinuity, some dialectic, that will enable me to forget him.” His future wife proved a stronger motivation than any dialectic. About his “Pynchonian” love letters, Franzen told The Paris Review, “I think it’s significant that she hated those letters and made her hatred of them known, and that I steered away from that voice.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/pynchons-gravitational-pull.html

The ruling, based on the constitutional protection against “cruel and unusual punishment,” stunned even the closest court watchers. The death penalty seemed impregnable.

2013-08-30,Southern Discomfort,"“Tell about the South,” his Harvard classmates beseech Quentin Compson in “Absalom, Absalom!” You’ll notice he doesn’t have to be asked twice. Sensitive Southerners — and Southern writers most of all — seem to love nothing better than explaining themselves and their region to outsiders (or to themselves, if no outsider is handy). There are exceptions, though, and Wilton Barnhardt would stand at the head of any list: though born and reared in the South, he has, over the last two decades, produced three well-regarded novels that almost never stray south of the Mason-Dixon line. There ought to be a prize for such forbearance. Or maybe he was just biding time, stockpiling ammunition. Because at long last he has tackled the South head on. Lacerating but affectionate, as exuberant as it is shrewd, “Lookaway, Lookaway” is a Southern novel so sure-footed the only real question for Barnhardt is, “What took you so long?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/wilton-barnhardts-lookaway-lookaway.html

2013-08-30,Two (Sucked) Thumbs Up,"A year ago, on the day my wife, Liz, would give birth to our first child, we sat down to watch “The Avengers.” She’d already seen it, and it wasn’t something I was particularly dying to see — superhero movies aren’t usually my thing. My cinematic taste generally tends to the somewhat obscure and the challenging — I’d much rather rewatch anything by Rainer Werner Fassbinder than sit through any of the “Fast and Furious” sequels. But Liz had started to feel the fluttering of early labor, and our birth-class instructor had advised us that this particular stage could last for several hours. The best thing to do, she said, was find a distraction: go for a walk, play cards or watch a dumb movie. As it turned out, there wasn’t going to be a need for any distractions. Within minutes, that fluttering became what Liz described, with some understatement, as cramps. What followed was such an incredibly compressed labor that there’s actually a special name for it: precipitous labor, which happens less than 3 percent of the time. Our son, Jack, was born an hour and a half later, at home, in our bed. I still haven’t seen “The Avengers.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/magazine/two-sucked-thumbs-up.html

When I tilt my head upward a bit, or run my finger along the side of the frame, the cube lights up. What I see, floating six inches in front of me, is a pinkish, translucent computer screen. It gives me access to a few simple apps: Google search, text messaging, Twitter, a to-do list, some hourly news headlines from CNN (“See a Truck Go Airborne, Fly Over Median,” “Dolphin Deaths Alarm Biologists”). Beside the screen is a teensy camera built into the frame of the glasses, ready to record anything I’m looking at.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/magazine/googling-yourself-takes-on-a-whole-new-meaning.html

Barker of the rooms his father rented to test a radar system he was making for the U.S. military. John L. Barker Sr. — then an engineer at Automatic Signal Company — had been working on traffic lights in the 1930s, but during World War II, he dedicated himself to military research. “He pointed the machine out a window, and he tested it on cars that drove through an intersection.” Barker was about 8 years old at the time and admits that his memories are hazy. “I have no idea why I was even involved,” he says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/magazine/who-made-that-traffic-radar.html

2013-08-30,Alternate Realms,"In Aimee Bender’s short stories, the value of life is measured in terms of goodness, succulence and simplicity, all qualities that can be tasted, chewed and ultimately swallowed by the mouth or the mind. In “Appleless” (one of this new book’s many parable-like fictions), the nameless narrator distrusts a girl who doesn’t appreciate the bright-hued, hand-clutched density and watery meat of apples — and the narrator goes on, with the help of others, to devour every last apple in sight. The overachieving seamstress of “Tiger Mending” isn’t satisfied with simply stitching up cut lips and handkerchiefs; she eventually takes a job in a faraway country sewing the stripes back on ruptured tigers (who apparently yawn too widely for their own good). And in one of Bender’s best stories, “The Red Ribbon,” a bored wife can’t enjoy sex with her husband unless he pays her. She likes to keep track of their accumulating ecstasies in a ledger: “ ‘I need a specific amount, each time,’ she said, ‘or,’ clearing her throat, ‘I feel I will melt into nothingness.’ ” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/the-color-master-by-aimee-bender.html

2013-08-30,Free Range,"Major poets, like trick-or-treaters, tend to arrive in pairs or small groups (whether this is a matter of fate or academic convenience may be debated). And yet from roughly 1930 to 1950, British and Irish poetry seemed to fall under the sway of a single writer: W. H. Auden. Auden was hardly a solitary figure, of course — his compatriots included Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis (father of Daniel), and the four writers were once thought to be so intimately related that the poet Roy Campbell referred to them as “MacSpaunday.” But it wasn’t a relationship of equals: the MacSpaunday poets were usually considered notable not because of how closely they resembled one another, but because of how much the other three looked like Auden.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/louis-macneices-collected-poems.html

(HBO) LES MISÉRABLES (2012) Hugh Jackman (above, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role in the film), Anne Hathaway (who won for best supporting actress), Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne sing their hearts out in this adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel about an inspector’s pursuit of a convict and the love between a young woman and a firebrand of the French Revolution. “The artful grunge layered onto the cast can be a distraction, as you imagine assistant dirt wranglers anxiously hovering off camera,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Hathaway, though, as Fantine, “the factory worker turned prostitute turned martyr, and singing the showstopping ‘I Dreamed a Dream,’ her gaunt face splotched red and brown,” she wrote, “holds you rapt with raw, trembling emotion.” But while the director, Tom Hooper, demonstrated in “The King’s Speech” that he can be very good with actors, his “inability to leave any lily ungilded — to direct a scene without tilting or hurtling or throwing the camera around — is bludgeoning and deadly,” she added. “By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html
