So Alinsky published, in 1971, his landmark book, “Rules for Radicals” — a guide to “tactics, maneuvers, strategy and principles of action in the making of revolutions.” Using terms that might have been plucked from a military manual, he sought to wrest the high art of strategy away from the “Haves” of the world and give it to the “Have-Nots.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/magazine/strategy-may-be-more-useful-to-pawns-than-to-kings.html

Warren Beatty plays a role, as does the upstart Steven Spielberg.

2018-09-07,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Identity — whatever that even means — has been having a moment, lately. The political climate forces us all to decide grimly what bunker will welcome us, and the new culture wars spur people to define themselves before somebody else does it for them to possibly violent effect. Identity may be abstract and elusive, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have real-world consequences. So our recommended titles this week turn a spotlight on the subject, from Francis Fukuyama’s “Identity” to Kwame Anthony Appiah’s “The Lies That Bind” to two books about identity politics on college campuses: “The Splintering of the American Mind,” by William Egginton, and “The Coddling of the American Mind,” by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt. (Those similar titles are no coincidence: Both books hark back to Allan Bloom’s classic “The Closing of the American Mind.”) We also have a book about the Spanish man who for decades falsely claimed to be a Holocaust survivor, and a joint biography of the mother and daughter who gave their names to the Myers-Briggs personality test. In other realms, there’s a biography of the tennis legend Arthur Ashe; new fiction from Gary Shteyngart, Ben Marcus and Tsitsi Dangarembga; and an essay collection about the role of the “dead girl” in popular culture, which posits that — in that case, anyway — the absence of identity is the whole point.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2018-09-07,5 New Designers to Watch This Season,"Growing up in upstate New York, Graham Tyler Baldwin was fascinated by art galleries. His parents organized family trips to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where the young art aficionado teared up the first time he saw a room full of pieces by Alexander Calder. Now 24, Baldwin will debut his first ready-to-wear collection during New York fashion week, inspired by his memories of these expeditions. “Spring 2019 is from the perspective of myself as a child, dreaming after an art museum visit,” Baldwin says. “The collection seeks to replicate that childhood experience of first encountering the color field paintings of Brice Marden and Ellsworth Kelly.” Baldwin originally studied sculpture at the Cleveland Institute of Art and landed an apprenticeship in 2013 with the milliner Marta Glazen. “I became interested in headwear as a form of intimate sculpture on the body,” he says. When he moved to New York City in 2015, he made custom headwear on his own for clients such as Lady Gaga, MAC and Barneys New York, and later for fashion brands such as Adam Selman and Polo Ralph Lauren. Making so many hats for so many labels, Baldwin wanted to finally create a brand under his vision. This coming collection, his first foray into ready-to-wear, will include a moiré evening vest based on a small drawing by Ellsworth Kelly, a silk organza trench coat and, of course, beautiful headwear to top it all off.

The designer’s 60-odd jars and bottles — some made from thick, amber glass, others from Delftware and Limoges porcelain — once contained remedies derived from flora and fauna. In addition to creating her sculptural, boundary-pushing fine jewelry — delicate rose-gold rings that span two fingers, diamond half-moon hoops that float above the earlobe — Khouri has become something of an amateur herbalist. “I am fascinated by how botanicals can cure or cause harm, depending on how they are used,” she said.

The clear liquor is left to steep for at least two years; it turns umber as venom and pheromones leak from the dead insects. Some who’ve drunk it liken the taste to whiskey, others to salt and ash. But the larvae and pupae, carefully tweezed out of disinterred nests, are eaten immediately, gently simmered with ginger so they stay creamy, or fried to a crisp.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/t-magazine/eating-bugs-food-restaurant.html

Last February, Miuccia Prada closed her fall 2018 show with a series of nylon pullover jackets and bucket hats in an array of acidic neon hues, all bearing the Linea Rossa logo, a sleek red stripe. The new collection, which launches this weekend, retains the minimalist ’90s sensibility of the original line but features an updated fabric. Anoraks, padded jackets, quilted pants and bucket hats (there are also angular wraparound sunglasses) all come in a more technical, waterproof and windproof nylon, in a rainbow of new colors including highlighter pink, safety orange and bright mint green.

2018-09-10,Renouncing Hate: What Happens When a White Nationalist Repents,"Americans love redemption stories. The Old Testament tale of Exodus — the slaves’ flight from Egypt and their salvation in the desert — may be the most epic of all such sagas, and the Puritans aboard the Mayflower thought of their flight from King James as an exodus of the chosen people fleeing their pharaoh. Ben Franklin’s best-selling “Autobiography” mythologized his rags-to-riches rise from indentured servant to inventor and statesman, and in so doing he further stitched the redemption narrative into the nation’s moral fabric. Since then, activists, politicians and businessmen have all borrowed the story line to lend legitimacy to their ambitions, but few have done so more powerfully than civil rights leaders: Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that Christians who had succumbed to bigotry could repent only by righting racial wrongs; Malcolm X recounted his transformation from hustler and felon to militant activist and Muslim, and in so doing, he invited a nation of sinners to follow him down the same spiritual path. In America, the resurrected wretch (“I once was lost but now am found”) has more authority than the pious innocent — to have fallen and been redeemed is an act of self-invention and moral fortitude that mirrors the Pilgrims’ own impossible journey.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/books/review/eli-saslow-rising-out-of-hatred.html

Behind a commercial strip lined with big-box stores, among the split-levels and center-hall colonials, in the kind of neighborhood where kids run through sprinklers on summer weekends, crouches a massive mushroom-cap dome, 48 feet in diameter. Formed by bright red Quonset hut ribs and flanked by two smaller partial domes, the structure — whose windowless front is done in inky coal masonry studded with rough-hewn chunks of aquamarine glass — looks like a spaceship that’s pulled up its jet bridge. From the back, where its red exoskeleton is exposed, it resembles a birdcage.

A note on that last part: Thailand Unique stocks an extensive selection of insects for cooking purposes, including dehydrated silkworm pupae, highlighted in one of the dishes below. And a Maine-based company called Entosense sells online, too.

In the days leading up to New York Fashion Week — where she would debut the latest collection for her label, Lou Dallas — she has fixated, in particular, on a 1977 conversation between the singer and Barbara Walters that she found on YouTube. In the clip, Parton, then 31, is on the eve of major stardom — her first crossover hit, “Here You Come Again,” has just reached number three on the Billboard 100 — but her circumstances are still remarkably humble. The musician walks Walters through the tour bus that she shares with her 11 bandmates. Parton shows off her foldout bed and a narrow closet full of stage clothes which, she says, she washes by hand in motel sinks. Hanley is especially moved by a moment at the end of the interview when Parton, seated with Walters in the cramped bus kitchen so closely they’re brushing knees, declares her desire to be a superstar. “She was having a moment,” says Hanley. “She wanted to get bigger, and she was outlaying her strategy.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/t-magazine/lou-dallas-fashion-brand-raffaella-hanley.html

Modern art is the product of trained students much more than of solitary geniuses, and whole chapters of art history were written in schools that became, sometimes just for a few years, epicenters of invention. It happened at the Bauhaus and the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in Germany, at Goldsmiths and the Glasgow School of Art in Britain, at Black Mountain College and CalArts in the United States — and, 100 years ago, in the bright first days after revolution, it happened at a short-lived art school in a provincial outpost of Russia. In its classrooms, far from the lights of Moscow and the raging civil war, professors and students got to work imagining art for the utopia to come.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/arts/design/chagall-lissitzky-malevich-russian-avant-garde-jewish-museum.html

2018-09-13,How Sardinian Weaving Nearly Became a Lost Art,"WHEN ISABELLA FRONGIA, 61, perhaps the most gifted weaver in Samugheo, the Sardinian town best known for its textiles, was a little girl, she would watch her mother, Susanna, work for hours at her loom. Located in the entry hall, the loom had been built of oak and chestnut by a local carpenter, and its squared edges had long ago gone smooth to the touch. Susanna, who is now 86, would sit before it, raising alternate strings attached to bamboo poles by pressing on the wooden pedals at her feet. She would send a bobbin of weft thread gliding across the horizontal surface of the remaining strings, strung taut in the loom’s belly, before yanking a heavy hinged wood batten with metal teeth toward herself, locking each new row into the others. This simple gesture — passing a weft thread through a base of stable warp threads — is the same for every piece of cloth ever woven. And on this loom, Susanna made everything the family needed, from bedcovers, blankets and towels to the wool textiles laid atop wood chests and the saddlebags slung over the backs of donkeys or men to transport things. Each piece was crafted according to designs and patterns stored in an unwritten repository of techniques and styles, many unique to the island, which over centuries had been passed through the hands of Sardinia’s women.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/t-magazine/sardinian-weaving-woven-textiles.html

Eliasson spent most summers with them in Reykjavik, during which he was often relied upon to babysit his new sister. At first, he resented it. “Victoria was quite demanding,” he says with a laugh. “But it was a very bonding experience. I remember it now as a luxury of simplicity.

Considering his propensity for giving life, God would probably be a mother.

But Spain is not ignored either, with Txikito-style octopus carpaccio and skate with sherry, chili and parsley. The long, narrow space, formerly their Texoá coffee bar, has been done in 1930s Modernist style. A central bar, lit by a complex hanging fixture by the local artist David Weeks, is its focus. “I was inspired by the Maison de Verre in Paris,” Ms. Raij said, referring to a landmark building on the Left Bank. “I didn’t want anything blue and nautical-looking.” Glass brick and hard-edged metal are also used.

2018-09-18,How to Throw a Party Like a British Fashion Designer,"“Food and wine are just the best things in the world, aren’t they?” the British designer Molly Goddard says with a laugh. Dressed in a matching cardigan and skirt in a kaleidoscopic poppy print, she’s surveying the party she’s throwing at the newly opened Russell Square restaurant Neptune during London Fashion Week. A D.J. is spinning dance hall tracks at a bar festooned with strings of multicolored balloons and draped with rose-pink metallic fringe. At intimate tables of two or four, hungry guests tuck into what Goddard calls “speed” dinners, in which three courses are served within a 40-minute sitting, to allow guests to either stay on and party or head home for an early night. The rest of the 200-strong crowd — a mix of friends, fashion editors, loyal fans of Goddard’s eponymous brand and models fresh from her recent runway show — are dancing to Sean Paul’s “Get Busy.” “We’ve got buckets of beer, wine, prosecco, cocktails. Whatever anyone wants, we have it,” the designer adds with a smile.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/t-magazine/molly-goddard-london-fashion-week-dinner-party.html

In the ’60s and ’70s, Kriemler’s parents, Max and Ute, expanded Akris’s scope, producing prêt-à-porter for such houses as Ted Lapidus and Givenchy. As a young man, Kriemler would often travel to fabric fairs with his family; on a trip to Paris in 1976, he attended his first Yves Saint Laurent show. “It was then that I knew I was completely infatuated with fashion,” he says. He made plans to study at Paris’s École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, but they were waylaid when, after Akris’s managing director died suddenly, Kriemler’s father convinced him to join the business as creative director in 1980.

2018-09-20,The Nobel Prize in Literature Takes This Year Off. Our Critics Don’t.,"Right about this time of year is when the literary world would normally be praising, bemoaning or just scratching its collective head over the latest winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Alas, this year’s prize has been “postponed” (two will be awarded in 2019) because of a sex abuse scandal in the august halls of the Swedish Academy, which hands out the award. That scandal is being covered elsewhere in this newspaper. But to help fill the void of conversation around the prize itself, I recently spoke with The New York Times’s staff book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — about what the prize has meant (or not meant) to their own reading habits; their opinions of past winners (and past snubs); and whom they would bestow the honor upon this year if they could. — John Williams",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/books/review/nobel-prize-literature-critics-discussion.html

It can be escapist or aspirational, extravagantly hyperbolic or easily plausible, but it’s still idealized. Every romance has a happy ending, after all. That’s a narrative constraint and a defining characteristic of the genre; it’s also a puzzle for an author to solve. Make your main characters too good or too perfect, and obstacles to their happy ending seem far-fetched. Make them too flawed, and maybe they don’t deserve a happy ending. Here are five new romances that grapple with their protagonists’ shortcomings and virtues — their worthiness of a happy ending — or at least leave their readers doing so after the final page.

At a time when baggy tailoring was the prevailing aesthetic in men’s wear, a relative newcomer made a case for a precisely crafted razor-slim silhouette. The Times’s fashion critic at the time, Cathy Horyn, singled it out as “the most anticipated show of the fall 2001 men’s season.” Tomorrow, some 17 years later, Slimane will make another buzzy debut, unveiling his first collection for Celine as the French brand’s artistic, creative and image director, a role created specifically for him. Since his arrival at Celine in January — where he took over from Phoebe Philo, who announced her departure last year — Slimane has been remaking the house in his own image.

2018-09-28,"Original, Handwritten Manuscripts of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’","“He can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,” one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of “The Picture of Dorian Gray” in Lippincott’s Magazine. This was just one of “hundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out,” Wilde’s grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wilde’s handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. “It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend,” the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. “Somehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. … I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly.” Such sentences led Lippincott’s readers to deem this, in Holland’s words, “a disgusting, sodomitical novel.” (He added that the full text would later be used in court as “circumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual” — a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new book’s foreword, considers this “the urtext of ‘Dorian Gray,’” revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. “He was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased,” Holland said of his grandfather. “He had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/books/review/picture-of-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde.html
