Women could neither vote nor run in the kingdom's first nationwide municipal elections, earlier this year.

And both the late actor's relatives and the authorities are at a loss, if not quite spellbound. The thief used a concrete saw to cut through terrazzo and sidewalk, then carted off the 300-pound, five-pointed pink star bearing Peck's name and the motion-picture logo, both rendered in brass. It was not the first caper involving a star's star, said Johnny Grant, the civic figure known as the mayor of Hollywood: James Stewart's and Kirk Douglas's stars were once lifted from a storage area by a construction worker. And Gene Autry's star, according to legend, once disappeared to the wilds of Iowa. All three stars were quickly replaced, as was Peck's, which was unveiled again yesterday afternoon. Mr. Grant said the thieves had very likely struck sometime before the middle of November, though no one could pin it down. ""It is bizarre,"" said his widow, Véronique Peck. ""It reminds me that the word 'fan' comes from 'fanatic.' "" She said she had visited her husband's star with their grandchildren a year ago and appreciated its importance to tourists. ""It's a crime to the city, but I think it's almost amusing,"" she said. ""Frankly, I think Greg would chuckle."" DAVID M.

As a result, 4,700 janitors at those companies will unionize in what is one of the largest organizing successes ever in the private sector in the South.

The union said this would assure union recognition for another 600 janitors. The janitors, most of them immigrants, work part time and average $5.25 an hour.

It is the second building on the city's historic Museum Island to be restored, after the Old National Gallery, in a $2 billion project that has been plagued by financial problems.

This weekend, visitors can tour the restored building and also get a look at the master plans for Museum Island's full restoration through interactive, three-dimensional computer models that will be installed at the Pergamon Museum, next to the Bode. Museum Island was listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1999, and the full renovation of all its buildings is to be complete by 2015.

2005-12-02,"36 Hours in Whistler, British Columbia","MYRTLE and Alex Philip found their own pot of gold when they came from Maine and built the Rainbow Lodge by the shores of Alta Lake in 1914. There were several dozen year-round residents living on Alta, a fishing hole 75 miles north of Vancouver. The locals were intrigued by the sound made by the western hoary marmots at the lake, so they called the area Whistler. The 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley in California inspired a group of Vancouver businessmen to build a ski resort and bid for the Games. London Mountain was rechristened Whistler Mountain and opened for skiing in 1966. A dozen years later, an area used as a dump was transformed into a European-style town. Now there are 115 places to stay -- from ski chalets to luxury hotels -- almost 100 bars and restaurants and 200 places to shop. Those Olympic dreams? They'll come true in February 2010 when events like skiing and sledding are held in and around Whistler. Now is a good time to visit, before the gold rush starts.

2005-12-02,ROY DeFOREST,"Back in the 1970's, regionalism was a dirty word. In the thoroughly global outside-is-in art world of today, it is barely a word at all. But the artists at whom it was aimed -- postwar Americans working outside New York and Los Angeles -- continue to suffer from its fallout. The singular greatness of Jim Nutt and Peter Saul has only recently started to come into focus; the achievements of H. C. Westermann, Robert Arneson and Joan Brown are less fixed in art world consciousness than they should be. Ditto for Roy DeForest, who is showing new paintings for the first time since 1997 at the George Adams Gallery in Chelsea. At 75, Mr. DeForest is painting pretty much what he has painted for years: dogs, men in hats or headdresses, and supernatural beings against a flattened terrain. Angular, masklike, brusquely rendered, they all seem shamanistic and slightly crazed; their bright, staring eyes imply the ingestion of hallucinatory substances. Mr. DeForest continues to favor dense compositions and oppressively bright colors unrelieved by much in the way of white. (The white goat in ""Goat Daze,"" above, is an exception.) His signature technique persists: tiny dollops of paint, whose culminating twists suggest chocolate chips but also thumbtacks, with their points facing out. His new works have become slightly more structured: compartmentalized into patchworks of portraits, friezes and pictures within pictures, as if the artist had a new appreciation for classic American folk art. They are also more inventive and sensuous in their handling of paint. The bristling textures have diversified -- new additions include mosaiclike sections of dried acrylic paint -- and the clearer composition increases their impact. These works have a blatant, consummate ease. If Mr. DeForest's goal is to transfer the ecstatic experience of the world from his creature-subjects to his creature-viewers, it has never been more clearly or radiantly stated.

Its music was rugged swing and harmony and texture and sweeping, singable tunes, acoustic jazz full of a reason for being. Mr. Avital is a physical, knockabout player, and the same feeling spread out through his band; the vamps and long solos were worth waiting for, but even the written lines had integrity.

2005-12-02,JOHN JASPERSE,"Mr. Jasperse structured last year's ""California"" (seen by New Yorkers at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) around a monumental architectural element. In ""Prone,"" above, which opens tonight at the Kitchen, he's gone small. Seating (so to speak) is extremely limited, with audiences splitting time between inflatable mattresses arranged within the dancers' space and chairs set up around the performance area. Lying on their backs, viewers can watch the action unfold as reflected in a mirrored ceiling or rely more on their peripheral vision. The choreographer, always interested in perception and spatial configuration, has experimented with mirrors before; in 2003's ""just two dancers"" at Dance Theater Workshop, audience members used hand-held mirrors to watch various sections of the dance. Likewise, in ""Prone,"" viewers are expected to become active participants and decision makers, figuring out how best to watch the dancers Luciana Achugar, Levi Gonzalez and Eleanor Hullihan. Don't let those mattresses fool you; Mr. Jasperse demands just as much from his audiences as he does from his dancers. ""Prone"" is danced to a commissioned score by Zeena Parkins, performed live. Mr. Jasperse is both visual and lighting designer, with Joe Levasseur. If the choreographer's previous works are any indication, all of the artistic elements will more than pull their own weight.

2005-12-02,DAMIAN MARLEY,"Bob Marley's youngest son, Damian Marley, 28, has been working at his music career for longer than a minute. His album ""Halfway Tree"" (Universal) won the 2002 reggae Grammy Award without causing much of a popular stir. But this year Mr. Marley, above, had a big hit with the rueful social critique ""Welcome to Jamrock."" Absent any trendy braggadocio or bullying electronics, the song is a throbbing throwback to the observational political style of Jamaica's pre-dancehall days. But this retro ploy isn't a sign that the hip-hop-savvy Mr. Marley is stuck in the past. Rather, he has proved to be a step ahead of a game saturated with booty beats and gruff toasters, both righteous and clownish. He saw an opening in reggae for the sort of incantatory agit-prop that would remind people of his country's continuing exploitation at the hands of drug traffickers, opportunistic government sellouts and, of course, hedonistic tourists. The radio and remix crowd ate it up. Its haunting vocal sample, taken from an Ini Kamoze song -- ""Out in the streets, they call it murder"" -- resonated not only with Jamaican poverty but also with the strife of the disenfranchised, from Iraq to the American South. That pointed, ghostly refrain became the DJ segue of the summer. The song still had traction as the Katrina tragedy unfolded, when another passage seemed to voice the collective frustration of places like the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans: ""To see the sufferation sicken me/ Them suit no fit me/ To win election they trick we/ And they don't do nuttin' at all."" (Mr. Marley plays on a bill with X-Clan. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street.

This two-CD collection starts with Ms. Carter and her family in 1939, and ends with a family singalong in 2003. Her tangy voice held a growl that led her at first toward comic songs, often about straying men. She wrote at least one country classic, ""Ring of Fire"" (with Merle Kilgore). But she was more collaborator than star, releasing only three albums of her own. Carter Family songs are included, 1950's singles, her hit duets with Cash and her entire 1975 album, ""Appalachian Pride,"" her fullest statement about heritage and the present. What's missing is a fuller selection from her later albums; a 1999 version of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken,"" sung solo to an acoustic guitar, finds the song's mournful essence.

2005-12-02,'STANDARD GAUGE: FILM WORKS BY MORGAN FISHER',"The Whitney Museum of American Art continues to journey down avant-garde memory lane, with a retrospective devoted to Morgan Fisher. Like the films of Owen Land (a k a George Landow), the subject of a recent museum retrospective, Mr. Fisher's work falls under the rubric of structural film in that it calls attention to its own materiality as well as to the conditions of its production and reception. One significant difference is that like many filmmakers who work in the shadow of Hollywood, the Santa Monica-based Mr. Fisher has long explored the space that segregates art cinema from industrial moviemaking. A film like the one-minute-30 second-long ""Wilkinson Household Fire Alarm"" (1973), an eye-blink homage to Marcel Duchamp, is more obviously engaged with conceptualism than with studio manufacturing. Yet many more of Mr. Fisher's films explore the divide between art and industry directly, including his autobiographically inflected 1984 short ""Standard Gauge,"" above, in which he traces the history and uses of 35-millimeter film through discarded bits of celluloid and a voice-over that waxes both pedantic and poetic. This dialectical engagement continues in the 2003 short ""( ),"" in which the filmmaker shows his editing skills to bravura effect by stringing together insert shots -- those discrete images of, say, a newspaper headline or a pointed gun that fix your attention on narrative details and actions -- that he has lifted from other movies. Although Mr. Fisher includes clocks and dice in his entrancing cavalcade -- which ebbs and flows like a series of unfinished stories -- what seizes the imagination are all the hands clutching weapons and knees, flying across typewriter keys and cooking and serving. Here, from the detritus of the movie industry, Mr. Fisher has created singularly, authentically handmade art. (""Standard Gauge: Film Works by Morgan Fisher 1968-2003"" runs through Feb. 12 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Kaufman Astoria Studios Film and Video Gallery, second floor, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; information: (800) 944-8639) MANOHLA DARGIS THE LISTINGS | DEC. 2--DEC. 8",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/arts/movies/the-listings-dec-2dec-8-standard-gauge-film-works-by-morgan.html

He notes that everyone in the area uses Thurayas, little phones a bit bigger than cell phones that work off a satellite signal, and adds: “It seems possible that Thurayas service to the janjaweed and the government of Sudan may be a critical vulnerability of the genocidal campaign. Interruption of that service might deal a significant blow to their command and control capabilities and save some of the refugees….As the only American shareholder in Thuraya, and the provider of their core technology, Boeing stands in a unique position to influence Thuraya to cut off service to the government of Sudan and the janjaweed militia, as much as possible.

The Gruesome Guide to World Monsters (Candlewick, $18.99, ages 6 and up), by Judy Sierra, is presented as a kind of global travel guide to recognizing and avoiding local legends. Peppered with Henrik Drescher's exuberantly creepy mixed-media illustrations, the book takes a geographic joy ride through the international imagination, finding folk monsters like the Ovda of Finland, which tickles its victims, and the Adaro of the Solomon Islands, which likes to throw poisonous flying fish at people for no reason. More familiar characters are found in Fantasy Encyclopedia (Kingfisher, $24.95, ages 9 to 14), by Judy Allen, with a foreword by Jonathan Stroud, which takes a more comprehensive approach to cataloging creatures from ancient mythology to modern fiction. Lavish illustrations by John Howe, Nicki Palin and Patricia Ludlow complement photographs of cultural artifacts and document a few nonimaginary subjects, including the Romanian tyrant Vlad the Impaler, who sounds just as unnerving as the boggarts, trolls and basilisks roaming through the book.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/books/review/the-gruesome-guide-to-world-monsters-and-fantasy-encyclopedia.html

But don't hate Paul Zollo, an editor at American Songwriter, for fulfilling the dream first and confirming what you've suspected all along: that Petty is an undeniably fascinating guy to talk to. Sure, there is some dead air in these interviews, but it's abundantly offset by Petty's indelible stories of his Florida upbringing by a father who liked to poke alligators in the eye for fun, and the time the supposedly laid-back Petty became so frustrated with a recording session that he punched a wall, shattered his fist and spent eight months retraining himself to use his left hand. And the chapter devoted to Petty's memories of a bassist who eventually died from a heroin overdose may be the most chilling deglamorization of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle since ""Sid and Nancy.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/books/review/music-chronicle.html

2005-12-05,'Shopping in the Renaissance'," In February 2001 the British artist Michael Landy took over an empty department store in central London. Before a fascinated and occasionally distraught audience of friends, fellow-artists and strangers drawn in from the streets, he and his assistants placed all his personal possessions on a conveyor belt. Looping round the complex, mechanised route, Landy's furniture, record collection, clothing and even his car were first inventoried and then systematically dismembered, divided and shredded. The work attracted considerable press attention and provoked a powerful public response. Landy's emphasis on destruction was seen as a challenge to the champions of consumerism and as a strong commentary on the seductions of acquisition and ownership. The setting, the bare interior of a store stripped of its lighting, counters and displays, was central to the work's meaning (Figure 1). As shoppers moved on from the performance into the still-functioning department stores and shops nearby, they were invited to reflect on the ultimate purposelessness of their purchases.

Both singers have been the objects of considerable hype, but while I haven't heard them together live in an opera house, there are indications that they're at least partly as good as their billing. Mr. Villazón has an ardent blood-and-guts Domingo-esque delivery; what people seem to be asking is just how big the sound is in the opera house. (It seemed perfectly adequate to me in recital last year.) Ms. Netrebko's ""Sempre Libera"" aria album struck me as a little bloodless and machinelike, but on the recording of their ""Traviata"" in Salzburg this summer, which came out earlier this month, she seems if anything overemotional. It's a tossup whether you want to spend the money for the ""Traviata"" recording -- on which Thomas Hampson does not do much to further his case as a Verdi baritone -- or on one of the few tickets left for ""Rigoletto,"" a show that spotlights the baritone even more: CARLO GUELFI appears in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/arts/the-week-ahead-dec-4dec-10-classical-music.html

He was born near Krakow, Poland, where he attended the Jagiellonian University. During World War II, in great danger, he and his wife and daughter evaded incarceration in the Jewish Ghettos of Poland and he then recorded his experiences under Nazi occupied Poland in a book, ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (Capstone Publishing Company, New York, N.Y., 1993). After the war Zygmunt Modzelewski joined the Polish Provisional Government, becoming the first Polish Director of UNRRA (United Nations Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Administration). He then held a series of positions concerned with the reconstruction of Poland. He was appointed Chief Delegate to the UNRRA Council in London and Chief of Mission to purchase American and British industrial and communication war surplus. He came to the United States as President of the Polish American Supply Corporation but, disappointed with the political direction of the increasingly communist government, he resigned his position and, with his wife, the late Jadwiga Eva (nee Hechtkopf), and daughter, received political asylum in the United States.

Grove Press, which he purchased in 1951 for $3,000, cracked open the federal censorship statutes by successfully defending the United States publication of D. H. Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" in 1959, Henry Miller's ""Tropic of Cancer"" in 1961 and William S. Burroughs's ""Naked Lunch"" in 1962. The Evergreen Review, begun in 1957, expanded America's literary, political and psychic palette, providing the first widespread domestic access to political figures like Che Guevara and Malcolm X and literary figures like Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Harold Pinter and the Beats. And he published almost all of Samuel Beckett's oeuvre, and served as his American agent for more than 35 years.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/movies/MoviesFeatures/samuel-beckett-is-ready-for-his-closeup.html

The half-hour also includes sailing lessons, group bouquet-making and a jury duty theme (that's how the couple met).

2005-12-05,Inside the list,"MAKING BOOKER: John Banville's Booker Prize-winning novel, ""The Sea"" is No. 28 on this week's extended hardcover fiction list, and it seems unlikely to climb much higher -- making it the third Booker selection in a row, after DBC Pierre's ""Vernon God Little"" (2003) and Alan Hollinghurst's ""Line of Beauty"" (2004) not to rise into The Times's top 15. The last Booker winner to make a deep impression on this country's readers was Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi"" (2002), which spent three months on the Times list in hardcover. Banville's novel is selling well in independent bookstores -- if this week's list were based only on sales from indie booksellers, omitting the chain stores, ""The Sea"" would move up 20 spots to No. 8. Banville's novel has taken a beating since the Booker announcement. (Writing in The Independent of London, Boyd Tonkin said the jury made ""the most perverse and perhaps the most indefensible choice in the 36-year history of the contest."") Banville didn't help his case when he said, while accepting his award, ""It's nice to see a work of art winning the Booker Prize."" Banville, at this point, may feel some sympathy with Pierre, who accepted his 2003 Booker by commenting, ""As Lloyd Bridges said, 'I think I picked the wrong week to give up sniffing glue.'

According to the prosecutor, the oldest of them (25) acquired the weapon, the middle brother (24) lured his sister to the scene of the crime and the youngest (18) shot her. The trial began on Sept. 21. Ayhan Surucu, the youngest brother, had confessed to the murder and claimed that he had done it without any help. According to Seyran Ates, a lawyer of Turkish descent, it is generally the youngest who are chosen by the family council to carry out such murders -- or to claim responsibility for them.

One of them is our selection of the year's 100 Notable Books, chosen from those reviewed since last year's Holiday Books issue. Some readers will remember that for many years the list of Notable Books was considerably longer. That's because almost all the books that made our weekly choice of recommended titles automatically landed on the year-end list. Last year we trimmed the list to 100 and have done so again this year. Why? Simply put, the longer list had become unwieldy -- a dauntingly expansive grab bag rather than a concise guide to exceptional books. Not that limiting the number to 100 is an ideal solution, or that the results are authoritative. On the contrary, the choices are wholly subjective. Had each member of our editorial staff drawn up a separate list, no two would be identical. What we present here, then, is a rough consensus. For this reason, a forum has been set up on our Web site where we encourage readers to respond to our choices and to guess which books, drawn from this week's 100, will end up on our list of the 10 Best Books of the Year that will appear next week.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/books/arts/up-front.html

Even during the last nine months of her life, after she was discovered to have myelodysplastic syndrome, or M.D.S., a particularly virulent blood cancer, she continued to persevere in the belief that she would be the exception. M.D.S. is technically a precursor to acute myeloid leukemia. On average, its survival rates across the generational cohorts are no better than 20 percent, and far worse for a woman in her early 70's who had had cancer twice before. It wasn't that she didn't know that the biological deck was stacked against her; as someone who prided herself on her ability to grasp medical facts, she knew it only too well. In the immediate aftermath of her diagnosis, she went online to learn all she could about M.D.S. and despaired as the fact of its lethality sank in. But that despair was almost the flip side of a lifelong confidence in her ability to defy the odds. ""This time, for the first time,"" she told me, ""I don't feel special.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/magazine/illness-as-more-than-metaphor.html

I lifted the lid off the box, and immediately I noticed my grandmother's handwriting, a jumble of words that spilled out to fill the room.

Death was due to complications of cancer and came only after a long and courageous fight. She is survived by her husband Philip, two daughters: Lucy and Elizabeth Watson; three sons: William Watson, Patrick and David Wilson; and ten grandchildren, all of whom are overcome by their loss, and struggling with the reason as to why. Kit was a delightful, caring person who made the world a better place in which to live. She was an avid reader, but enjoyed social interaction and had a quick wit. She could exchange jokes with the best. She was also proficient in many athletic pursuits, but the game of tennis, the skills of which she acquired as a teenager from the incomparable teachings of Dorothy Wightman, was her first love. She practiced it artfully and effectively much to the dismay of opponents, the gratitude of partners and the admiration of all. Kit also derived much pleasure from the intimate and enduring friendships she maintained with many persons from all over. These relationships were of utmost importance to her and remained at the top of her mind until the bitter end. Were she able, she would be the first among her family to thank all those dear friends for their tender condolences, for which the severity of her illness impaired direct and timely acknowledgement; likewise to express her and our gratitude to the loving and tireless caregivers who comforted her and her family during her passing.

And it's tax deductible, Mom and Dad. For information, call (212)310-6617. Mini-cellphones are now the norm, so it's no shocker that there are tiny sports cars too.

2005-12-05,'Ice'," To someone who lives in the temperate north, the event seems simple enough. When the air turns cold, the water in ponds and brooks, lakes, rivers, ditches, and water glasses freezes on top. If the air stays cold, the ice on top gets thicker. It may get thick enough, in lakes and ponds at least, that as the Christian knight told the disbelieving Saracen in Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman, a horse could carry you ""over as wide a lake as thou seest yonder spread out behind us, yet not wet one hair above his hoof."" To the Saracen, this preposterous claim was evidence that the knight belonged to a nation that loves to laugh. ""Neither the Dead Sea,"" he scoffed, ""nor any of the seven oceans which environ the earth will endure on the surface the pressure of a horse's foot."" He was misinformed; several of the Earth's seas and many thousands of its lakes and ponds can take the pressure of a horse's foot in winter, and more besides. Yet there are things that happen when a body of water turns to ice that seem almost as improbable, when you find out about them, as the knight's claim, made under a knot of palm trees by a plashing fountain, seemed to the Saracen.

But it need not be a chore, according to the stationer Drew Souza, of IS on Crosby Street. The only imperative when it comes to thank-yous, he confides, is to send them. He suggests you write at least three sentences, avoid clichés (an evening- or gift-specific anecdote is thoughtful) and do it by hand, no matter how keyboard-weakened your penmanship. Souza also advises waiting until January to send holiday-related thanks: ""If it arrives on Dec. 22, no one will have time to open it."" Let us now give thanks.

""Aeon Flux"" (Paramount), starring Ms. Theron and directed by Karyn Kusama (""Girlfight""), opened at No. 2 with $13.1 million. It was the only new film in wide release this weekend, but the studio did not screen it in advance for critics, so it had a one-day head start over the widely unfavorable reviews it received on Saturday. ""Walk the Line"" (Fox), the Johnny and June Carter Cash love story, dropped one spot to No. 3 with an even $10 million, bringing cumulative sales over three weeks to $68.7 million. ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" (Paramount), the remake of the 1968 Lucille Ball-Henry Fonda picture starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, was No. 4 with $8.4 million in its second weekend, bringing its total gross to $34.5 million.

2005-12-05,Arts Briefly; Film Museum Closes in Moscow,"The Moscow Film Museum has shut the doors of its longtime home after a protracted real estate struggle that drew rare street protests from Russian film lovers. The museum, which housed a collection of memorabilia from Tarkovsky and Eisenstein, had been in the Kino Center, a huge building in central Moscow that was constructed in 1980's for the Soviet Filmmakers' Union, but since 1991 has been gradually taken over by casinos, restaurants and strip clubs, and also has a commercial movie theater. The director of the museum, Naum Kleiman, said earlier this year that he had been served with eviction papers, and it closed down on Thursday. ""We have to say goodbye to these quarters,"" he told the newspaper Izvestia. ""It's the past, which has now ended up in the hands of people who are strangers to film."" The Russian Filmmakers' Union last year sold its stake in the building to a company said to be linked to Nikita Mikhalkov, the Oscar-winning director and the chairman of the union, a connection that raised eyebrows in Moscow. Mr. Mikhalkov recently announced that he was taking a break from his position with the union to complete several film projects. The museum's collection is being moved to Mosfilm Studios, and is to have screenings at a government-run cultural facility, but still hopes for a new permanent home.

A student council committee proposed on Sunday that a new organization be formed to represent graduate students at the university, and that the deadline to end the strike, now in its fourth week, be put off until tonight. N.Y.U.'s president, John Sexton, and provost, David McLaughlin, accepted the proposal. But pro-union graduate students rejected it yesterday, saying that it did not respond to their demand for a union to represent them as employees. Karen W.

At a military hearing at Fort Riley last month, a soldier convicted in one of the killings said he had lied when he implicated Lieutenant Anderson, his platoon leader, so he could get a shorter prison sentence.

Its lineup, particularly ""Desperate Housewives"" (25.4 million) and ""Grey's Anatomy"" (20.75 million), dominated the Sunday primetime landscape in total viewers. Among adults 18 to 49, its margin of victory was even greater: ABC's overall rating in that age group more than doubled second-place CBS's. That network had a football spillover into prime time on the East Coast, helping ""60 Minutes"" draw the most viewers from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. But the first part of CBS's ""Pope John Paul II"" movie did not fare as well. The pope tale (shown too late to obtain an exact tally of viewers) was beaten not only by ABC but also by NBC's ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (11.81 million) and ""Crossing Jordan"" (12.44 million). NBC did not do as well with the post-sweeps return of ""The West Wing"" at 8 p.m., which brought in an audience of a mere 7.22 million.

Through his active participation, he deepened his own understanding of the bridge between his Jewish heritage and that of the democratic America he loved so very much. During the past decade as a member of the Board, Peter helped refine the Skirball Cultural Center's mission and guided the Center's growth as a cultural and educational institution into the largest of its kind in the world.

As a driving force in the growth of Levi Strauss & Co., his unprecedented devotion to corporate responsibility made him a role model for business leaders worldwide. His generosity to the community as a supporter of social causes helped improve the lives of millions of workers, children, and the poor.

When Steinbeck opened his 1945 novel ""Cannery Row"" by describing Monterey's waterfront zone of sardine factories as ""a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream,"" California's prodigious sardine industry was the largest fishery in the Western Hemisphere. But the end of the Row as he knew it was already in sight. The silver river that for years had poured out of boats and into Monterey's 19 canneries and 20 meal and oil reduction plants was drying up. By the 1950's, it had disappeared altogether, and the Row eventually became one long tourist trap with a terrific aquarium at the end.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/07/dining/cannery-row-ii-starring-the-sardines.html

Prosecutors charge that he falsified time sheets to claim he was working for the city when he was really working for Cicatelli, which holds city contracts for H.I.V. and AIDS programs. From 1997 to his dismissal last year, prosecutors claimed, Mr. Nolte stole $30,000 in city salary. Over the same period, they said, he made more than $100,000 from Cicatelli. Mr. Nolte, 63, was fired after a baby suffocated under a pile of toys in a city-licensed day care center in Queens. He pleaded not guilty to grand larceny and fraud. His lawyer, Elizabeth M. Fink, said Mr. Nolte had been fabulous at his city job, and had stolen time, not money, while he was under stress supporting his companion of 30 years, who died in 2003.

O'Keeffe, who died in 1986, married Stieglitz, the photographer and art collector, in 1924 and was based in New York when she painted the cityscape. The Tennessean of Nashville reported this week that Fisk expects to raise $16 million to $20 million by selling ""Radiator Building"" and Marsden Hartley's abstract ""Painting No. 3"" (1913) and will use the money for new buildings, the university's endowment, faculty positions and security for the remaining 99 works in the 101-piece Stieglitz collection, which had remained intact for 56 years. The collection also includes works by Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec and Cézanne, is housed at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery on the Fisk campus. Within Nashville's artistic community, reaction to the sale of two of the crown jewels of the Stieglitz collection was mixed. University president Hazel O'Leary, a 1959 Fisk alumna who was President Bill Clinton's first Secretary of Energy (1993-97), told The Tennessean that the decision to sell the pieces was difficult but necessary for the private college to remain competitive. Fisk also filed court papers in Nashville to verify its legal right to sell the pieces under O'Keeffe's original deed of gift; the Tennessee attorney general, Paul Summers, has approved the sale under certain conditions, two of which are that Fisk must use its best efforts to sell the paintings to Tennessee residents, and that the buyer or buyers must assure Fisk that the public will be able to view the pieces.

2005-12-08,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BAKER, GEORGE F. III.","BAKER--George F. III. The NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College mourn the tragic death of our beloved and esteemed friend and Trustee George F. Baker. A creative and uniquely talented man of strong commitment and outstanding intellect, Mr. Baker was elected Governor of The Society of the New York Hospital in 1977 and went on to serve on the Board of the merged NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the third generation of his family to do so. The family's deep interest and dedication to the New York Hospital dateback to 1899, and the Baker Pavilion of the NewYork - Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center stands as a monument to their loyalty and service to the Medical Center. During his 18 years of Board service, Mr. Baker served on several Board committees, including Executive, Finance, and Nominating. He was honored as New York Hospital's Trustee of the Year in 1996. Since 1981, Mr. Baker has been an outstanding Chairman of the Hospital's Investment Committee, where his astute stewardship of its endowment and retirement funds has been invaluable. He served as Vice Chairman of the NewYorkPresbyterian Fund, Inc. (formerly The Society of The New York Hospital Fund, Inc.), and Vice President, and later President, of The New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc. (formerly The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc.). We will profoundly miss his abiding friendship, his wit, and his wise counsel. We will cherish his memory with the greatest affection. Our deepest sympathies go to the Baker family.

2005-12-09,The Listings: Dec. 9 -- Dec. 15; PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS',"Paula Scher's engaging paintings resemble big maps of places like Europe, Africa and the United States or metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Washington and Manhattan, but you would not want to rely on one for navigating the real world. Like Jasper Johns's paintings based on a standard map of the United States, they are paintings in the form of maps and not maps in the form of paintings. Measuring as large as 9 by 12 feet, the paintings are textured by innumerable hand-painted place names, laced by roads and borderlines and punctuated by all kinds of signs and symbols. Sometimes you find nongeographical information, like statistics from the last presidential election covering Gulf of Mexico waters in a map of Florida (above). Stylistically, the paintings have a zany, Outsider-like quality, though Ms. Scher is in fact a successful graphic designer whose résumé includes record album covers, a stint as art director for Time Inc. and logos for corporations and nonprofit groups. But though the Howard Finster-like naïveté is a sophisticated act, the paintings still look as if they were made by someone who lacks a clear grasp of the real world's geographical makeup. But then again, who does not have that chronically disoriented feeling that uncharted territories are growing at a faster rate than our ability to map them?

But the episode, a typical New York story in which real estate led to murder, gained that distinction because its popular Wednesday rivals were repeats. ""Law & Order"" helped NBC garner the most viewers over all, but ABC drew the largest number of 18- to 49-year-olds. Its repeat of ""Lost"" (10.97 million) was followed by an ""Alias"" rerun (6.44 million). The spy show performed as well after ""Lost"" as it did in its Thursday time period, when it was showing new episodes. On UPN, the finale of ""America's Next Top Model,"" in which the shy and awkward Nicole Linkletter, right, was crowned the winner, brought in 6.35 million viewers. UPN won the 8 p.m. hour in adults 18 to 34 and women 18 to 49, and, for the night, came in fourth in the 18-to-49 demographic. It beat CBS in that measurement, which showed the second part of ""Pope John Paul II"" to a mere 6.33 million viewers. With Oprah Winfrey's Dec. 1 appearance on David Letterman's ""Late Show"" drawing 13.46 million viewers, the show beat NBC's ""Tonight Show With Jay Leno"" for the week that ended on Dec. 2, its first such triumph since February 2000.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/arts/movies/arts-briefly-nbcs-novelty-beats-the-repeats.html

2005-12-09,The Listings: Dec. 9 -- Dec. 15; JAZZ GALLERY DUO PIANO SERIES,"The Jazz Gallery, a nonprofit performance space on the far west fringe of SoHo, has always taken pride in pianism. For the last nine years, this narrow, second-story club has touted a seven-foot Baldwin with pedigree: it was the house piano at the beloved Greenwich Village club Bradley's for 18 years, and before that a possession of the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond. Another acquisition at roughly the same time -- a five-foot Yamaha that had belonged to the singer Carmen McRae -- made the Jazz Gallery one of the very few clubs in the city with two good pianos. This bounty was quickly put to practical use, with a duo series that has been a distinctive feature of Jazz Gallery programming. Next week, as part of the organization's 10th-anniversary season, the series returns with five piano pairings, each promising a slightly different chemistry. Tuesday night will feature Jason Lindner (above right) and Luis Perdomo (left), players known for percussive fluency and a command of Latin rhythm. On Wednesday, the versatile hard-bop veteran George Cables meets a highly regarded newcomer, Danny Grissett. Thursday's program pairs Orrin Evans and Gerald Clayton, who both balance traditional grounding with contemporary vision. The series will conclude with the experimentalists Amina Claudine Myers and Vijay Iyer, next Friday; and Mr. Clayton again, this time with the urbane elder Kenny Barron, Dec. 17. Before the run even begins, an uptown site, Merkin Concert Hall, will offer the latest installment of its own duet series (see Kenny Werner and Jean-Michel Pilc, below), so piano enthusiasts have something going every night next week.

Many arts presenters shudder at the very hint of audience boredom, but Vallejo Gantner, Performance Space 122's artistic director, says he is ""very excited"" to be showing the Iranian-born Mr. Sharifi's work as part of the space's Norway in New York festival of experimental theater and dance. Mr. Gantner describes the two-week event as the ""opening volley"" in creating more collaborative and touring opportunities between American and Scandinavian artists and presenters. He admits to a limited knowledge of contemporary Norwegian dance, but says he considers the festival ""an indicative cross section of some of the best work that's happening in Norway at the moment."" For his part, Mr. Sharifi, above, who immigrated to Norway by himself at 14, mixes Iranian music with improvisational, chaotic movement to create a work that Mr. Gantner reads as an ""expression of alienation and the experience of being neither fully Iranian nor fully Norwegian.""

New Yorkers have been able to order some out-of-state wines online or by telephone, but vineyards or businesses in other states have had to make arrangements with retailers or distributors in New York. That can drive up costs, increase delivery time and leave many wines, particularly from smaller vineyards, unavailable to New Yorkers.

2005-12-12,Satellite Radio: Out of the Car and Under Fire,"IN the early 1990's, when the pioneers of satellite radio raised the first of the billions they needed to get their ventures aloft, the premise was fairly simple: create services that would be to old-fashioned radio what cable television was to broadcast TV. That meant providing scores of niche radio channels with high-quality signals in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. By blanketing the nation with signals beamed from on high, there would be no need for all those transmitting towers, no utter dependence on advertising and no pesky etiquette rules from the Federal Communications Commission to observe. And, the early prospectuses argued, there was a huge, natural market of people who spend hours in their vehicles, often bored out of their skulls.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/yourmoney/satellite-radio-out-of-the-car-and-under-fire.html

Usually, species names derive from their physical or geographic characteristics, but biologists have christened their finds after everything from punk-rock bands to Ernest Hemingway. Even Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld have been honored -- with a trio of slime-mold beetles, but honored nonetheless. Wallace and his partners, however, had a different idea: Why not sell off the naming rights and use the proceeds to finance the monkey's habitat? He and the Wildlife Conservation Society soon got in touch with Charity Folks, a New York venue for nonprofits, which this past spring conducted the world's first online taxonomy auction. Ellen DeGeneres made a bold stab at winning the bid -- even publicizing the auction on her talk show -- but the highest offer came from GoldenPalace.com, a gambling and entertainment Web site, which put up $650,000.

2005-12-12,The Rise of Illiterate Democracy,"The nonfiction best-seller lists these days are often full of partisan screeds labeling Democrats as elitist traitors and Republicans as conniving plutocrats. But look over on the fiction side, and politics appears almost nowhere. Some critics read Philip Roth's ""Plot Against America"" as an allegory of the current White House, and there have even been a few blunt and appalling political fantasies, like Nicholson Baker's ""Checkpoint,"" a brief dialogue between a man who wants to assassinate George W. Bush and a friend who wants to talk him out of it. But unlike the ubiquitous nonfiction tub-thumpers, today's novels rarely take the grubby business of ordinary politics, past or present, as a subject, let alone an activity in which their authors might participate. Contemporary party politics, which once inspired writers as different as James Fenimore Cooper, Mark Twain and Robert Penn Warren, is terra incognita. The separation of church and state is hotly contested; the separation of literature and state seems to have become absolute.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/books/review/the-rise-of-illiterate-democracy.html

2005-12-12,JUVENILE CRIME GUIDELINES,"The New Jersey attorney general last Wednesday directed the state's police departments to adopt uniform guidelines for first-time juvenile offenders charged with minor infractions, to keep them out of court and free of a police record. The directive grew out of a survey of the local police in which 356 departments reported that they were already using various mechanisms to keep juveniles picked up on minor violations from going to court. But 40 more departments that responded had no such programs, according to the survey, creating a disparity in the treatment of juveniles within the state. Even those that did have such programs, state investigators said, had little documentation, formal guidelines or enforcement. Officials provided no details on which communities have the programs and which do not. The guidelines direct the police to use ""station house adjustments"" that in the past have informally been in effect for youths when they are arrested for the first time for ordinance violations, petty disorderly-conduct charges and other minor infractions.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/nyregion/briefs-crime-juvenile-crime-guidelines.html

(Still banned: box-cutters, knives, hammers and ice picks.) T.S.A. officials said the move was part of a larger effort to focus more on finding explosives, instead of confiscating small items the agency doesn't feel pose a serious threat. In addition, the T.S.A. said it was going to increase the number of random searches of passengers. The development of a Las Vegas-style resort community, the first ever in Spain, is being planned for Ciudad Real, roughly 120 miles south of Madrid.

The planned Caesars complex will include an 850-room hotel, a 50,000-square-foot casino and a 3,000-seat theater. Speaking of Las Vegas, Atlantic City's loss is aparently Sin City's gain.

2005-12-12,‘After the Victorians’," In 1900 there was published in Vienna one of the most extraordinary and revolutionary texts ever to come from a human brain. Die Traumdeutung (The Interpretation of Dreams) expounded the theory on which all subsequent psychoanalysis was based, even or especially those psychoanalytical theories which reacted most violently against it: namely, that the human mind consists of what might be described as two layers. With the outer layer, of our conscious mind, we reason and form judgements. In reasonable, well-balanced individuals, the pains and sorrows of childhood have been worked through, put behind them. With the unhealthy, however, neurotic or hysterical individuals, there is beneath the surface of life a swirling cauldron of suppressed memories in which lurk the traumas (the Greek word for wounds) of early experiences. Under hypnosis, or in dreams, we re-enter the world of the subconscious and with the care of a helpful analyst we can sometimes revisit the scenes of our early miseries and locate the origins of our psychological difficulties. The author of this world-changing book, Dr Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), was a happily married neurologist, born in the Moravian town of Freiberg, but for most of his life resident in Vienna, hub of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where his consulting room in Berggasse 19, Vienna IX (from 1931), and his celebrated couch, on which patients lay to recite their sorrows, became a totemic emblem of the century which was to unfold. The need to return to some forgotten, irrational, dark place of our lost past became compelling, personal and collective, as the hysteria of the twentieth century reached its crescendo-point and as Dr Freud, a Jew, though a non-believing one, packed his belongings and took his family to live in London for the last year of his life, following the Anschluss, the joining together of Germany and Austria into a Great Germany, Grossdeutschland. He had already had the honour of having his books burned in Berlin in 1933, and in 1938 they were burned in Vienna.

In October, though, Iraqis went to the polls and ratified a Constitution that committed itself with equal strength to both democracy and Islam. The document announced that Iraq would be a democracy with equality for all and declared that no law could contradict the principles of democracy. At the same time, it declared Islam the basic source of law and the official religion, and it decreed that no law could contradict ""the provisions of the judgments of Islam.""

A creative and uniquely talented man of strong commitment and outstanding intellect, Mr. Baker was elected Governor of The Society of the New York Hospital in 1977 and went on to serve on the Board of the merged NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the third generation of his family to do so. The family's deep interest and dedication to the New York Hospital dateback to 1899, and the Baker Pavilion of the NewYork - Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center stands as a monument to their loyalty and service to the Medical Center. During his 28 years of Board service, Mr. Baker served on several Board committees, including Executive, Finance, and Nominating. He was honored as New York Hospital's Trustee of the Year in 1996. Since 1981, Mr. Baker has been an outstanding Chairman of the Hospital's Investment Committee, where his astute stewardship of its endowment and retirement funds has been invaluable. He served as Vice Chairman of the NewYorkPresbyterian Fund, Inc. (formerly The Society of The New York Hospital Fund, Inc.), and Vice President, and later President, of The New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc. (formerly The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc.). We will profoundly miss his abiding friendship, his wit, and his wise counsel.

""Sponging,"" as the scientists at the Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project call this behavior, is an unusual instance of an animal using another animal as a tool, but that is not what makes the sponging interesting to biologists.

2005-12-12,Up Front,"The British journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft did not want to be a journalist -- and that has probably been good for his writing and his career. After attending Oxford, he took up typography and, he says, ""spent several fruitless years in publishing, as a designer, publicity manager and editor."" It was only after turning to journalism, ""involuntarily but gratefully,"" that he found his calling. Now a freelance writer, he has been literary editor of The Spectator and a columnist for The Sunday Telegraph. Wheatcroft's strengths are those of an ""involuntary"" writer -- of someone, that is, who set out with no particular mission or political agenda. The extent of his interests is reflected in his books, which include: ""The Randlords,"" an account of the South African mining magnates; ""The Controversy of Zion,"" about Zionism's impact on the Jewish people; and ""Le Tour: A History of the Tour de France."" And as someone who is not given to polemical flights, he is unusually common-sensical, quick to perceive when one of his subjects has failed to keep his feet on the ground. Wheatcroft brings that common sense to his Page 1 review of Robert Fisk's ""Great War for Civilisation."" Looking at a fellow journalist who has been a lightning rod for controversy, he finds much to praise, but he also makes understandable why Fisk has provoked so much anger among so many.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/books/arts/up-front.html

2005-12-12,Revolting High Rises,"There is one detail about high-rise public housing that always seems to get left out of the discussion: the skyscrapers crowded with poor people are not very different from the sparkling towers of upscale apartments and condominiums often just a short drive away. The problem is that the former are unmaintained, unpoliced and in every way send the message to residents that nobody cares about them. Poverty, whether stacked up or spread out, whether in the middle of a city or out in the suburbs, is corrosive and dangerous and will not go away just because the rent is a little lower. Public-housing directors miss an opportunity with every project they build or tear down. With a little more money, these very slums could be their own engines for social change: give the residents job skills and then employ them in the maintenance of their own buildings and watch what happens.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/opinion/magazine/revolting-high-rises-853003.html

The key, according to researchers at McGill University in Montreal, is a gene that is linked both to red hair coloring and to higher levels of pain tolerance. It has been known since the mid-1990's that mutations of the MC1R gene are responsible for hair color -- and fair skin and freckles -- in about 70 percent of redheads. But when Jeffrey S. Mogil and his colleagues at McGill set out to find a genetic link to pain inhibition, MC1R wasn't at the top of their list of targets. ""We normally only get excited about genes in the brain when it comes to pain,"" he says. ""This is in the skin."" There was, however, a little-noticed paper that said MC1R was in fact expressed in the brain.

Born May 25, 1948 in Wuerselen, Germany, he died at age 57 following a long and brave struggle against lymphoma. Peterson-Buengeler graduated from Cologne University in Cologne, Germany with a degree in Germanics and Philosophy. In 1986 he relocated to the United States to pursue a Mid-Career Fellowship at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs and Public Policy. Upon graduation, he was named Director of University Programs at the Council on International Educational Exchange, retiring from that position in 1991. In addition to his work in international education, Peterson-Buengeler was deeply interested and involved in current affairs. He was an accomplished pianist and choirmaster, an avid gardener, loved fine cuisine and was a gourmet cook. Peterson-Buengeler is survived by his wife, Sandra, and sons, Geoffrey and Henry. Sandra Peterson, a well-known senior health care industry executive, is currently President and CEO of Bayer HealthCare's Diabetes Care Division headquartered in Tarrytown, NY. Geoffrey is a junior at Harvard University, and Henry is a ninth-grader at The Saddle River Day School. Peterson-Buengeler is also survived by his mother, Maria von Plettenberg Buengeler, sisters, Regina and Brigitte, and brother, Bruno. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Karl Paul Peterson-Buengeler Music Scholarship at The Saddle River Day School in Saddle River, NJ.

Shades of Henry Willson, the notorious Hollywood manager who groomed many homosexual himbos for stardom -- sometimes literally. (In ""The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson,"" a recent biography of Willson, Robert Hofler writes that Willson arranged a marriage between his secretary and Hudson.) Amazingly, it's much the same game 50 years later, in the real world and in Beane's, where the idea of a male star walking down the red carpet with his boyfriend is as ludicrous as the unnatural liaisons in the nursery rhyme that provides the play's title.

2005-12-12,Inside the List,"THE ITALIAN JOB: For more than half a century, ""Il Cucchiaio d'Argento"" -- ""The Silver Spoon"" -- has been Italy's best-selling cookbook. It's the country's ""Joy of Cooking,"" a volume given to brides on their wedding day. ""The Silver Spoon"" has now been translated into English, and the result -- a big, well-marbled slab of a cookbook -- is catching on with American readers; the book is No. 13 on this week's extended hardcover miscellaneous list, available on the Web. (The only other cookbook on that list is ""Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook,"" at No. 8.) ""The Silver Spoon"" gives good value. It weighs in at 1,263 pages and has some 2,000 recipes, but it sells for $40. It's also full of surprises -- put the cheese on your pasta before the sauce, the authors advise -- and, happily, it hasn't been stripped of its Italian character. (There are piles of recipes here for things like buck's horn plantain, hard to come by in this country.) The classics are covered back-to-front -- there are 23 risotto recipes -- but ""The Silver Spoon"" also works in some interesting margins; you'll learn three ways to cook a calf's head, and methods for making both heart and eel kabobs. The authors can be sticklers. The recipe for costata alla fiorentina begins: ""Those who wish to serve authentic Florentine T-bone steaks should follow the rules of the Articles of Association of the Florentine T-Bone Steak Academy, founded in 1991 by representatives of the Florentine Butchers' Association.""

2005-12-12,Fiction Chronicle,"TWINS. By Marcy Dermansky. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $21.95.) Writers love identical twins. What tidier way to show different sides of one character, explore possible life paths or test the limits of nature and nurture? Dermansky does all that, but her twins (who take turns at narrating) transcend the gimmick in a brainy, emotionally sophisticated bildungsroman-for-two. Chloe, the elder by four minutes, longs for a life of her own, independent of her clingy sister, Sue, who envies her (Chloe is an eighth of an inch taller) and thinks she's smarter and prettier. Sue adores Chloe, whose every gesture toward independence sends her into paroxysms of jealousy. On their 13th birthday, she wheedles and bullies Chloe into getting tattoos -- with each twin bearing the other twin's name. ""Sue thought tattoos would prove to the world that the bond we shared went deeper than DNA,"" Chloe explains. ""The funny thing was, the tattoos made us different. When we died, it would be easy for a forensic scientist to tell us apart. . . . After we got our tattoos, we were never really and truly the same."" Both twins are obsessive, vulnerable, ambitious and hungry for love, but these qualities take on different forms. Chloe keeps her room in perfect order, setting herself apart from her untidy sister, while Sue vomits up her meals in an effort to stay the same weight as Chloe, who intently counts her calories. Yet as they mature and their circumstances change, they find themselves swapping roles. Most teenage protagonists have to learn what it means to be themselves, but Sue and Chloe have an extra task: learning what it means to be -- or not to be -- each other.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

The Finance Ministry had previously maintained a growth forecast of 3.5 percent, even as the central bank cut its 2005 estimate in July and again in October to a range of 2.75 percent to 3.25 percent. The economy will expand about 3.5 percent next year, Mr. Gil Díaz, left, said. ""Growth has not been at the level we would have liked and has proved unsatisfactory and insufficient in meeting the requirements of job and salary growth,"" Mr. Gil Díaz said. ""Things would have been better if we had been able to achieve some of the profound reforms that are so necessary and important for our country."" Mr. Fox has drawn criticism from all three major presidential candidates for his inability to spur faster growth. The nominee of the president's National Action Party, Felipe Calderón, has pledged to avoid what he calls mistakes in dealing with Congress if he is elected in July, promising action on Mr. Fox's stalled plans to rework the tax system and allow private investment in the oil and gas industry.

EST at Coney Island Hospital in Coney Island, NY, from organ failure after a long bout with senile dementia. He was 86. A decorated member of the NYPD and veteran of the United States Armed Forces from 1941-1945, Mr. Alcindor received three commendations for outstanding police work as a patrolman in 1961 and then as a lieutenant in 1966 and 1978. In addition, he was awarded a medal at City Hall by New York City Mayor Abraham D. Beame. An avid musician, Mr. Alcindor brought his talents on the trombone to the New York Transit Authority Police Band, even playing at the 1962 Democratic National Convention. His musical talents also led to his involvement in one of the most famous events in U.S. history, as Mr. Alcindor was in attendance as a band member when Marilyn Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy with ""Happy Birthday"" at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, an event, according to his son, he never forgot. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Mr. Alcindor attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he teamed with legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman on the school's handball team that captured the city championship. He followed that up by attending the Juilliard School to pursue his career ambitions of becoming a musician. Hopeful of one day playing with the Count Basie Band, Mr. Alcindor enjoyed working with some of the musical giants of his time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Kenny Durham, Al Gray and Tito Puente. He also had a stint playing with the Benny Carter Band in the late 70's and early 80's. Married for 53 years, Mr. Alcindor's wife, Cora, passed away eight years ago.

Son of the late Rhea and Joseph T. Marder, D.D.S., Jerry was an advertising executive, real estate investor, buffalo rancher, avid Long Island fisherman, jazz buff, and family man. A former Executive Vice-President of Grey Advertising (now Grey Global), he was born in N.Y.C. in 1926. He attended Fieldston School, Cornell University and graduated from the Columbia Business School (1950). During WWII, he was a radio officer in the U.S. Maritime Service and U.S. Army Transport Service. He served during the Korean conflict as a 2nd Lt. in the U.S. Army. He spent 30 years at Grey, managing accounts for clients including Macy's, Proctor & Gamble and Revlon. A pioneer in government advertising, he managed campaigns for the U.S. Navy, Joint Recruiting Advertising Program, and U.S. Department of Transportation. After his retirement in 1986, he was instrumental in the rebirth of Miami's South Beach and served on the boards of LIM and Lesley College, among others. With his brother, he built (by hand) and ran BelleAir Farms, a buffalo ranch in Northeastern PA, home of ""Buffalo Belle"" brand bison. His first marriage to the late Barbara Sand Marder ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Joan Kron, the author and Allure editorat-large; son, Jonathan Marder and his partner Gregory Grimes of NYC; daughters Susan Zelouf and her husband David Zelouf, M.D., of Merion, PA and Jane Martin and her husband Matthew J. Martin of NYC; stepson, Daniel Kron and his wife Geane Brito of Miami Beach, FL; brother Michael Z. Marder, D.D.S. of Rockland County, and five grandchildren. He was adored by all. The fluke swimming off Montauk Point may sleep more securely now, but Jerry will be sorely missed by the family he was devoted to and by his friends and colleagues. Donations can be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, H-918, NY, NY 10021 for Dr. David Kelsen's research in pancreatic cancer.

Variety’s critic Todd McCarthy panned the movie and now its editor, Peter Bart, hops in, saying the film “takes such pains to avoid advocacy that it neuters its narrative.” The Carpetbagger is familiar with Neutered Narrative syndrome and has heard that the treatment is both prolonged and painful. Mr. Bart also pipes up about Mr. Spielberg’s decision to stay in the weeds rather than swan for an Oscar, and asks the eternal question of whether it is best to lay low or lobby. The question is not settled, but you get the feeling that Mr. Bart thinks a hail of “For Your Consideration” ads in Variety is the way to go. So what if all it does is salve your A-List star in a B-List clunker? It’s all well spent.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/neutered-narrative-syndrome/

2005-12-13,A Challenge for Bill O’Reilly,"After Sunday’s column about Bush’s arrival at the Pearly Gates, I thought I would be pilloried for heresy, sacrilege and who knows what else. And here and there I was.But so far I’ve received fewer outraged letters and letter bombs than I had expected (the device is actually an old one: In 1516, Erasmus wrote of Pope Julius II meeting St. Peter — and being sent away). And I did hear from two prominent evangelicals who said they agreed entirely with what I wrote — they think that it’s absurd for the focus of religion to be boycotting Target or telling people how to greet each other, particularly when there are more urgent problems like, for example, genocide.As one put it in an email: “Every time I see the Fox News Channel talking about the War on Christmas, I find myself thinking , or saying out loud, sometimes yelling, “What about the War on Poverty and AIDS !?! ” (and I could add genocide, trafficking, etc….) You are right on in your column today and I hope to go public soon in saying so.”By the way, my main complaint isn’t with Bush. As some readers noted, Bush hasn’t waged the Christmas campaign, and in fact the White House Christmas cards angered some conservatives because they didn’t use the word Christmas or show a religious scene. My problem with Bush is celebrating Christmas by putting up trees and holding parties, while cutting funds to stop genocide.The coverage of the “war on Christmas” at Fox is also about hypocrisy, but is more blatant at a time when there are so many more important things to cover. Frankly, Fox’s campaign seems to me to be more about ratings than anything. Ranting gets viewers, particularly if it’s ranting at the usual suspects — like “liberals.” I just wish that Fox would send a camera crew to Darfur and cover something that genuinely violates tenets of not just Christianity but every religion. And that’s genocide.So here’s a challenge for Bill O’Reilly: If you want to do something journalistic, come along with me on my next trip to Darfur. You’ll have to leave your studio and deal with people who, if they don’t like you, will shoot you in a moment. But you’ll also have the chance to take a genuinely important and overlooked story and bring it into people’s homes. So come on, Bill. What’ll it be? More ranting from your studio? Or real journalism?",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/a-challenge-for-bill-oreilly/

Col. Lewis F. Setliff III, who leads the corps' restoration task force, said the new findings did not solve the mystery of the levees' failure but would lead to fuller understanding. Louis Capozzoli, an engineer with the state group investigating the levee failure, said the additional seven feet ""wouldn't make much difference,"" because the soil contained a thick layer of peat, and the piles would have had to be much deeper to get past that layer.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/14/us/national-briefing-south-louisiana-investigating-the-levee-failure.html

A former Executive Vice-President of Grey Advertising (now Grey Global), he was born in N.Y.C. in 1926. He attended Fieldston School, Cornell University and graduated from the Columbia Business School (1950).

He spent 30 years at Grey, managing accounts for clients including Macy's, Proctor & Gamble and Revlon. A pioneer in government advertising, he managed campaigns for the U.S. Navy, Joint Recruiting Advertising Program, and U.S. Department of Transportation. After his retirement in 1986, he was instrumental in the rebirth of Miami's South Beach and served on the boards of LIM and Lesley College, among others. With his brother, he built (by hand) and ran BelleAir Farms, a buffalo ranch in Northeastern PA, home of ""Buffalo Belle"" brand bison.

This news comes just days after Comedy Central announced that it would begin broadcasting a third season of ""Chappelle's Show"" next year. According to court documents posted on www.thesmokinggun.com, Mr. Abuelhija contends that Mr. Chappelle owes him at least $864,500. In the suit, Mr. Abuelhija says he helped negotiate deals that earned the comedian at least $10 million. He says that he was fired after Mr. Chappelle returned from an impromptu sabbatical in South Africa in June. The suit alleges that Comedy Central paid Mr. Chappelle $4.5 million when he opted to continue his hit show through 2006 and also agreed to pay him $275,000 for each episode and $25,000 for each repeat. The agreement, the suit says, also guaranteed that Mr. Chappelle would receive 50 percent royalties from the show's DVD's.

The Art Deco landmark, on Sunset Boulevard, designed in 1929 by the architect Leland A.

Now it is under new ownership -- Jeff Klein, the owner of the City Club Hotel in New York -- and as of this month, it is the Sunset Tower Hotel. Mr. Klein commissioned the Los Angeles-based designer Paul Fortune to completely redo the interior, aiming for an understated elegance and comfort reminiscent of Hollywood hangouts of the 30's, 40's and 50's.

Dancers are seeking a new contract with the company in an effort, they say, to protect their jobs, safety and health. Among other issues, dancers want more control over rehearsals and how management handles dismissals. The company canceled a tour of Italy this year in a dispute related to per-diem allowances for the dancers to pay for meals.

2005-12-16,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; JOHN WATERS CHRISTMAS WITH THE TRACHTENBERG FAMILY SLIDESHOW PLAYERS AND KIMYA DAWSON,"The filmmaker John Waters has always found warmth and joy in the profane. In his garish films like ""Pink Flamingoes"" and ""Hairspray,"" he has also shown a keen instinct for finding the sweet spot where rock and schlock merge in ecstatic, trashy musical expression. It should come as no surprise that his antidote for depression surrounding this season's rampant commercial greed is to revel in its excesses -- and to subvert its pieties. This year, he has put together a live musical revue inspired by the wonderfully weird songs on his new collection of scavenged holiday nuggets, ""A John Waters Christmas"" (New Line). The director himself will be on hand offering his insight and reactions to songs like a Baltimore DJ's local hit ""Fat Daddy (Is Santa Claus),"" as well as a vanity recording of ""Happy Birthday Jesus"" by someone named Little Cindy, and the novelty cut ""Santa Claus Is a Black Man"" by AKIM & the Teddy Vann Production Company. Joining Mr. Waters in his celebration are two perfect co-conspirators. The Trachtenberg Family Slideshow Players -- the father, mother and daughter act (above, from left, Tina Piña Trachtenberg, Rachel Piña Trachtenberg and Jason Trachtenberg) who are performing their own holiday send-up, from Dec.18 to Dec. 23 at Performance Space 122 -- will sprint over from that earlier gig to add their hipster family values to Mr. Waters's mix. The singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson, who, with her erstwhile band, the Moldy Peaches, used to dress in a bunny suit, has often posited the worldly wisdom of children. Aside from her own always quirky adult musings, she brings to this wacky assemblage her distinctive insight into the minds of little misfits.

2005-12-16,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; 'BINGO',"Over the last few years, theater producers -- especially on Broadway -- have increasingly aped their counterparts in film, adapting beloved movies, casting Hollywood stars and incorporating computer technology into their designs. But there are still some things that are considered too lowbrow for even the Great White Way. Sequels, for example. Revivals may be a theater staple, but don't ever expect to see ""Death of a Salesman II: Biff Strikes Back"" on a midtown marquee. Selling popcorn is another no-no. Despite being a profit center for the movie business, popcorn is frowned on by theater people because of its loud, crunching sound, as well as the difficulty of cleaning the kernels off the floor. But those aren't the only reasons that most producers and owners ignore this potentially lucrative concession: according to several Broadway insiders, theater would sacrifice a certain snob appeal if ticket-buyers were licking the butter off their fingertips in the middle of the second act. But some theater owners are starting slowly to change their ways. Since the beginning of the fall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music has sold popcorn in the lobby, but not allowed ticket buyers to bring it into the theater. And in the production of ""Bingo,"" an Off Broadway musical about a clique of ladies (above, from left, Liz Larsen; Liz McCartney; Janet Metz, seated; and Klea Blackhurst) dead serious about the game, every audience member receives a bag, making this otherwise forgettable show perhaps the first popcorn musical in the history of New York.

Most of the collection (one example, above), according to the list on the site, consists of chess books and magazines, many of them foreign, some of them inscribed by Mr. Fischer with his name. Also included are an original manuscript for Mr. Fischer's ""My 60 Memorable Games""; 20 small handwritten notebooks detailing the openings played by some of his top competitors; and legal papers surrounding his attempt to copyright a chess move. In all, the seller says, the trove includes about 16 cardboard boxes full of material. The minimum bid is $15,000, and at least one has been received, from the Netherlands. The auction, which started last Friday, ends on Monday. The seller said the material was bought at a flea market six years ago and evidently came from a storage locker that Mr. Fischer rented in Pasadena, Calif. The contents were seized for nonpayment of rent. Mr. Fischer went into a tirade about it several years ago in a radio interview with a Philippines radio station, saying the seizure was illegal.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/arts/movies/arts-briefly-bobby-fischers-stuff-at-auction-on-ebay.html

A veteran of World War II, he began his Merrill Lynch career on September 20, 1946, as an account executive in the sales office at 70 Pine Street.

2005-12-16,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; COMPOSERS AND CHOREOGRAPHERS,"Dance and music are (mostly) inextricably linked, yet students of both art forms often have little to do with one another, even when they are studying at the same school. Thirteen years ago, Juilliard decided to do something about that and asked aspiring choreographers and composers to create short works together, to be performed at a lunchtime concert, open to all, but mostly attended by students and friends. This year, the school is offering two additional free evening performances, giving a bigger audience the opportunity to find out whether another Stravinsky-Balanchine pairing is in the making. ""Music and dance are created together in every culture except ours,"" said Pia Gilbert, the music division supervisor of the project. ""What the students tend to find out is that we use some of the same means of expression, even if our instruments are quite different."" The 12 students work together for two weeks -- playing music and dancing for one another -- before pairing off. Then they spend about two months making a six-minute work. ""Six minutes is not an insignificant amount of time for students to get a real sense of how an idea can come to fruition,"" said Elizabeth Keen, the dance division overseer. Laura Careless (above with Andrew Murdock), a third-year dancer who is collaborating with Jonathan Keren, a post-graduate composition student, said: ""To work with a composer so closely has really been eye-opening. If you understand another kind of process, it can help you find ways of working that you wouldn't necessarily find on your own."" (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Peter J.

The dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, contends that the dancers have not declared a strike and had also sought to continue negotiations. Dancers, who performed ""The Nutcracker"" since Dec. 1, are seeking a new contract with the company in an effort, they say, to protect their jobs, safety and health.

2005-12-16,The Listings: Dec. 16 -- Dec. 22; TIM BERNE'S PARAPHRASE,"There may not be a jazz musician more in tune with the notion of rugged individualism than the alto saxophonist and composer Tim Berne. More than 25 years ago, Mr. Berne released the first album on Empire, his own label. He has trafficked in the above-ground music industry since then -- recording for the Polygram imprint JMT, and, more fleetingly, Columbia Records -- but nothing seems to satisfy him more than self-reliance. Since 1996, Mr. Berne has channeled his autonomy through Screwgun Records, which he runs out of a brownstone in Brooklyn. The label faithfully mirrors its founder's ethos of hardscrabble abstraction: until recently, Screwgun CD's came in industrial brown cardboard, with graffiti-like scribbles by the graphic artist Steve Byram. ""Pre-emptive Denial,"" the label's 16th release, bears more colorful packaging but leaves the music raw; its source material was a bootleg of Mr. Berne's band Paraphrase, performing in the East Village just seven months ago. Dividing evenly into two 25-minute tracks, the album follows the sort of wide exploratory arc that has long typified Mr. Berne's compositional voice. The catch is that Paraphrase is a free-improvising trio, shaped as much by the sensibilities of Drew Gress, the bassist, and Tom Rainey, the drummer, (above left, with Mr. Berne, center, and Mr. Gress). Appearing in Mr. Berne's native Park Slope next week, the musicians will see their work supplemented with spontaneously arranged projections by Mr. Byram and another artist, Jonathon Rosen. This cross-disciplinary experiment could succeed or fail; either way, it should jibe with Mr. Berne's intrepid ideals. (Wednesday at 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. www.screwgunrecords.com)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/arts/movies/the-listings-dec-16-dec-22-tim-bernes-paraphrase.html

It’s from a new blog devoted just to flipping, though I can’t see what is wrong with flipping. A flipper takes an undervalued piece of real estate and makes it more attractive. The neighborhood benefits, as does the seller. The buyer may pay more, but then he probably passed up a bargain because of the lime-green shag carpet and the smell of the cat lady who had lived there.As with any real estate, it pays to be vigilant. There are a lot of shoddy flips, with substandard construction and low quailty applicances.

I know, it is dog bites man at this point, but that’s one of the things blogs are good for. The thing to watch for, more than sales activity, is inventory buildup. Price declines are harder to track because there often isn’t enough data in one town to get a good reading. Several expensive homes selling can easily skew the numbers upwards. It takes several month’s of data to track a trend.That said, the reports:Clark County, Washington: Clark County home sellers and recent buyers are beginning to find out that the red-hot residential real estate market, where median prices have shot up as much as 27.6 percent this year, is cooling.Phoenix, Ariz.: “Because it is difficult to sustain the levels of activity evident in the last year, the cooling is a good sign for the sustainability of the market,” says Jay Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center at Arizona State University.Sacramento, Calif.: “Some local markets appear to be overvalued, and in those markets there may be some price adjustments to bring sales and pricing back in line,” said analyst Greg Paquin of the Gregory Group, a Folsom-based real estate data and consulting firm.",Real Estate,https://walkthrough.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/a-chill-in-the-air/

Thousands of fans, some from as far away as Florida and Ohio and many who had to get out of bed by 4 a.m. even to get near the stage, drank, cheered and waved worshipful signs despite a cold drizzle. Bound for Sirius Satellite Radio, Mr. Stern addressed his fans for the last half-hour of his show, before the festivities moved to the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, which was surrounded by a phalanx of 20-something men spilling out into the street and trying to get a glimpse of the self-described King of All Media as he arrived atop a double-decker bus. Martha Stewart, who also has a show on Sirius, introduced Mr. Stern. The move to Sirius takes Mr. Stern outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, which has levied more than $2 million in decency fines on his old bosses at Infinity Broadcasting and the stations that carry his program. Sirius is going to pay him $100 million a year over five years to produce his own morning show and to program two radio channels.

Dozens of villagers used pails to collect the fork-tailed drongos, which range through much of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, in preparation for ""feasting on mysterious manna from heaven,"" Wilfred Lipita, the country's director of animal health, was quoted as saying in news reports. A Malawi newspaper, The Nation, reported that one resident was found with 700 of the birds and that one dead bird appeared to have been banded in Israel. Officials warned residents not to eat the birds because of the risk that the flu virus might be present. In most of the human cases reported in Asia, the disease was contracted while preparing fowl for slaughter or by handling infected birds. The flock of birds died in Ntichisi Province, about 125 miles east of Malawi's administrative capital, Lilongwe.

Speaking at a news conference in Monrovia, the presiding officer of the commission, Joseph Blidi, said the evidence presented by Mr. Weah's campaign was ""grossly insufficient."" Mr. Weah, above, a former soccer star, contends that the vote was rigged, and his supporters have clashed with the police and peacekeepers in Monrovia in the past few weeks. Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, the Harvard-educated economist who will be inaugurated next month as president and as the first woman elected head of state in modern African history, just completed a trip to the United States during which she met several top administration officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

A lightning rod for attention even before it opened, the film has earned plaudits from critics' groups along with predictable sneers, and provoked argument over its gay bona fides. That ""Brokeback"" is a landmark is a matter of empiricism; its merits as a work of art are a matter of taste. What has gone missing is that this is also that rare American film that seamlessly breaches the divide between the political and the personal, the past and the present. Here, against the backdrop of the great American West, that mythic territory of rugged individualism and the Marlboro Man, is a quietly devastating look at masculinity and its discontents.

2005-12-19,'John Paul the Great'," It was early morning in the Vatican, July 2, 2003, a brilliant morning in the middle of the worst Roman heat wave in a century. The city was quiet, the streets soft with the heat. It was the summer of the dress code battle between the tourists and the guards at St. Peter's Basilica. The tourists wanted to wear shorts and halter tops; this was in violation of the Vatican dress code (slacks, shirts with sleeves), and the guards wouldn't let them in. There were arguments at the entrance, and angry words. Soon a Roman compromise was achieved: No one lost face; everyone got what they needed. The vendors in St. Peter's Square were allowed to sell paper shirts and pants for a euro apiece. The tourists would put them on over their clothes, walk past the guards, and tear the paper off as they entered the dark cool of the church.

Ms. Preston was the daughter of Margaret (Walker) and Harry Preston, and grew up in Fairlawn, NJ. She was an artist, an avid sailor, and a lifelong lover of books and animals. She studied art under the Abstract Expressionist Hans Hoffman at his New York studio and later at the University of California Berkeley. She spent five years studying painting in France. She worked for many years as an art director at Macmillan Publishing in New York City, and continued her painting and book design from her studios in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn and in Jamesport. In the 1980's she became active in local real estate and also rehabilitated several Brooklyn and North Fork houses, doing much of the work herself. She was an enthusiastic sailor, sometimes delivering boats between Newport, RI and Florida, and earned a ""sixpack"" Coast Guard license that certified her to carry up to six paying passengers. In leisure times, she sailed her blue Bristol on Peconic Bay. She is mourned by her longtime companion Virginia Olga Lee; by her large family, including her sisters-in-law Ruth Preston and Wilhelmina (Billie) Preston and her nieces and nephews; and by her many friends. Cremation was private. Interment will be at Orient Central Cemetery at a later date.

When Tom Wolfe made it the title of a 1973 anthology featuring pieces from such writers as Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson, Joan Didion, Norman Mailer, and others, he meant it to be a declaration of independence from any journalism that had preceded it. But there were others-particularly the New Yorker crowd that had been stung by ""Tiny Mummies""-who criticized Wolfe for trying to trademark a technique that had existed for over two hundred years. They contended that there was nothing new about New Journalism. ",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/chapters/the-gang-that-wouldnt-write-straight.html

These people get to know the children in school very well and in a different way from the families with whom they live.

2005-12-19,Inside the List,"JOHN, PAUL: The Beatles may not be bigger than Jesus -- as John Lennon famously remarked in 1966, causing consternation, album-burning and later an apology -- but this week they may be bigger than the pope. ""The Beatles: The Biography,"" by Bob Spitz, lands at No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, while ""John Paul the Great,"" Peggy Noonan's breezy remembrance of that pope, climbs to No. 21 on the extended list. Spitz's account charts the trajectory of John, Paul, George and Ringo from their bleak Liverpudlian boyhoods through dazzling superstardom and their ultimate breakup. It's actually one of a whole shelf of Beatles books out now, albeit the only on the list. Most of the others are about Lennon, 25 years after his murder. ""John,"" by Cynthia Lennon, who was married to the Beatle from 1962 to 1969, paints the picture of a man wounded by the deaths of family and friends, and tells the difficult story of the domestic front during Beatlemania. ""If there is to be a balanced picture of Dad's life, then Mum's side of the story is long overdue,"" Julian Lennon, the couple's son, writes in the foreword. ""Memories of John Lennon,"" edited and introduced by Yoko Ono, is a collection of remembrances, including one from Mick Jagger: ""He was the one I really got on with the most. We weren't buddy-buddies but we were always friendly."" There's also ""Lennon Revealed,"" by Larry Kane, a reporter who traveled in the Beatles' entourage during their 1964 and 1965 North American tours, and ""John Lennon: The New York Years,"" a book of recollections and photos by the rock photographer Bob Gruen. To top it off, Paul McCartney's trippy children's book, ""High in the Clouds,"" spent two weeks on the children's picture-book list earlier this fall.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2005-12-19,Nonfiction Chronicle,"740 PARK: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building. By Michael Gross. (Broadway, $26.95.) The unexamined life may not be worth living, but it can be worth reading about -- especially if it takes place at 740 Park Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In a sprawling book brimming with detail about the building's ashlar-patterned Indiana limestone facade, co-op board and mortgage interest, and yet stingy on insights into its inhabitants, a group that has included Jacqueline Bouvier, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Saul Steinberg, Henry R. Kravis and Ronald O. Perelman, Gross tells the story of a building ""conceived in 1929 as the most expensive, the most exclusive, simply the best apartment house in the world."" Gross, who has written for New York magazine and Vanity Fair, describes how 740 went from a 1930 co-op to a 1936 rental building and then back to a co-op in 1953, and throws in gobs of real estate porn: descriptions of winding marble staircases, marble-floored vestibules and, best of all, huge, untrammeled living space. Non-New Yorkers might glaze over at his Genesis-like recitation of quickie marriages, offspring and Reno divorces of dozens, if not hundreds, of the building's residents, ranging from Marshall Field III to Jerzy Kosinski, who wrote ""The Painted Bird"" while living there. And even sophisticated New Yorkers may balk at the way Gross covers emotional terrain (one divorce becomes ""inevitable,"" he writes casually, when money runs low). Finally, the book's thematic organization -- ""Old Money,"" ""Oil Money,"" ""New Money,"" ""Borrowed Money"" and ""Other People's Money"" -- precludes a narrative flow, as Gross skips frantically across the decades.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html

That ""Brokeback"" is a landmark is a matter of empiricism; its merits as a work of art are a matter of taste. What has gone missing is that this is also that rare American film that seamlessly breaches the divide between the political and the personal, the past and the present.

The oversized book, originally produced in a Syrian monastery, includes the first dated pictorial representation of the Crucifixion. Tests revealed, among other things, that in the repainting, Jesus's curly red hair was restyled as black and straight. The findings were presented at a conference this month at the Max Planck Institute organized by Gerhard Wolf, director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, and Massimo Bernabò, who teaches at the University of Pavia, in Italy. Mr. Bernabò said the discovery would force scholars to re-evaluate this significant monument of early Christian art and subsequent attitudes toward it.

There have been others who might be mentioned, of course: Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has battled for debt relief – and achieved a great deal – and Bob Geldof has sung and talked himself hoarse to get people to pay attention to Africa’s suffering. These are all people who have made a real difference to the continent’s year. ",Opinion,https://smith.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/the-year-of-africa/

In Nielsen estimates, CBS was No. 1 in total viewers by a large margin; a new episode of ""Cold Case"" at 8 p.m. was the most-watched program of the night, with 15.29 million viewers. But Fox attracted the 18-to-49-year-olds on Sunday. Its spillover of the Washington Redskins' slaughter of the Dallas Cowboys began the night with a victory in that demographic, and Fox never gave up its lead. From 7 to 10 p.m., the network won every half-hour among adults 18 to 49: ""The Simpsons"" was its highest-rated entertainment program. NBC placed fourth for the night in both total viewers and 18-to-49-year-olds. In place of ""The West Wing"" at 8 p.m. was a Tom Brokaw special about soldiers from the Iraq war. It fared even worse than the political drama usually does during that hour, drawing only 6.04 million viewers. At 9 p.m., CBS delivered the largest audience for President Bush's 20-minute address about the war, followed by ABC, Fox and NBC.

2005-12-20,Speaking in Tongues,"There’s loads of foreign intrigue in the scrum to see what foreign films end up being considered for the Oscar. According to Variety, getting lined up for the ultimate American recognition “can be a political minefield that makes the United Nations look veritably zen-like, with each country’s entry functioning as a diplomatic envoy to the all-powerful King Oscar.” Hopefully, they are more effective than the U.N. when it comes to intervening in global conflicts.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/speaking-in-tongues/

2005-12-20,That’s Our Girl,"Speaking of operating in that over the top realm, our pals at Defamer – they aren’t actually our friends and Carpetbagger would not know Defamer if he were punched in the nose by them, but it’s just a bit of blogging convention – points us to a wonderful story about Shirley MacLaine defending Jennifer Aniston, her co-star in “Rumor Has It” — a bit of Oscar season anti-programming. During a press opportunity, Ms. Aniston was asked about her fling with Vince Vaughn and mama MacClaine stepped in. “I’d like to confirm that Vince Vaughn prefers older women and that Jennifer is just my beard. It was me in the car with Vince in Arizona and I was looped. I’m having a ball and Jennifer is taking all the guff.” Defamer, as is their wont, plays the scenario out and beyond, suggesting, “what can start as a mere PR ploy of convenience can quickly escalate into MacLaine locking Jennifer in an empty FAO Schwarz, as she manically performs a ‘mysteries of reincarnation’ stuffed animal puppet show for her terrified captive audience.” Confused? Well, it’s a meta, meta, meta world. Follow the links and it will all become clear. ",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/thats-our-girl/
2005-12-20,Playing Small of Its Size,"The industry’s addiction to giantism and its perils was writ large in the coverage of King Kong’s box office. How is it that a movie that opens to the tune of $66 million dollars – the same amount that “The Godfather III” took in during its long and illustrious life – is deemed something of a flop? Peter Jackson’s willingness to go over-the-top and stay there is part of what gives “Kong” its campy charms, but camp does not come cheap. If you want your dinosaurs to chase dinosaurs with other dinosaurs in their mouth, it’s going to going to cost you $200 million, give or take. And that’s a lot of popcorn.

In a town that runs on money and dines on power, the tickets, which are directly doled out in relation to the number of nominated movies a particular studio has, are the one thing that dollars and sheer corporate might cannot purchase. It can get mighty nasty, and Hollywood titans have been known to get into a lot of feelings come Oscar time. Harvey Weinstein, who typically controlled gobs of tickets by virtue of his touch with the little statue, was known to be charry with his corporate overseers at Disney. And this year, it will be interesting to see how many tickets Focus Features sends up the food chain. With “Brokeback Mountain” in the thick of it, and “Pride and Prejudice” along with “The Constant Gardener” bound to pick off a few nominations, the division of NBC/Universal will have some love to spread around come Oscar time. Will the owners have to come on bended knee, or will Focus decide that managing up is a strategically sound business strategy?

Federal authorities said they were still seeking to determine whether he served as a spy for the Iraqi insurgency. The translator, Noureddine Malki, 46, was surrounded by federal marshals during a brief proceeding before Chief Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court. A federal prosecutor explained that the heavy security stemmed from unexplained telephone calls Mr. Malki made from Brooklyn to people linked to the Iraqi insurgency, and to the sensitive classified military documents found in his Brooklyn home. Mr. Malki's lawyer, Mildred Whalen, said ""he categorically denies having any knowing intentional contact with anyone who had any interest against the U.S. or designs against the U.S."" Mr. Malki faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced early next year.

But Annie Proulx, above, told Sandy Cohen of the Associated Press that she was knocked out of the saddle by Heath Ledger’s turn as Ennis, the lonesome cowboy, in “Brokeback Mountain.” She said his portrayal was “really beyond description as far as I’m concerned. He got inside the story more deeply than I did. All that thinking about the character of Ennis that was so hard for me to get, Ledger just was there.” And thanks to Zeke, one of the Rugrats in the comment section, we find out that a light-hearted Ledger said that when he was looking for a model for a frustrated Western ranch guy who had trouble with the language, his thoughts turned to the 43rd president of the United States. “I wanted him to be a clenched fist and essentially my mouth became a clenched fist and the words became part of the battle.” Too bad he never had to get his lips around “nuclear” in the role.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/a-fiction-thats-better-than-fiction/

That’s the word from a suit filed by the Academy, which sued a number of brokers who it alleged were attempting to sell tickets to last year’s Oscars, some for more than 50 times face value. The suit, which was filed last spring, was briefly noted in the press at the time, but seems about to conclude with stipulated judgments all around and a promise from the defendants never again to do what they denied doing in the first place.

He joined Shearman & Sterling in 1965 and was elected to partnership in 1973.

In a nonjury trial, Acting Justice Victor Ort of State Supreme Court found the man, John Kogut, not guilty on three counts. Mr. Kogut, then an unemployed landscaper, was one of three men who were convicted, based on his videotaped confession. He was freed in 2003, after improved DNA technology demonstrated that a semen sample from Ms. Kogut's body did not match any of the three men convicted. A few months later, however, the Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, announced that he would retry Mr. Kogut. Mr. Dillon has not said whether he will seek retrials of the other two men, John Restivo and Dennis Halstead. ""Justice was finally done after 20 years,"" said Paul Casteleiro, Mr. Kogut's lawyer.

The European Commission, the union's regulatory arm, said that government grants to help consumers buy or rent digital decoders in 2004 and 2005 may have given an unfair advantage to RAI and to Mediaset, owned by Mr. Berlusconi. Mediaset and RAI dominate Italy's television market. Both run three free-to-air channels, controlling about 90 percent of the market for TV advertising and viewers. ""The subsidy seems to help free-to-air operators enter the pay-TV market,"" said Europe's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, above. Sky Italia, a pay-TV satellite broadcaster, had complained about being ineligible for the aid.

According to a civil case that is winding down in Los Angeles Superior Court, a pair of good seats for the Oscars, which have a face value of $700, went for as much as $40,000 this year and could cost up to $60,000 for next year's event, which takes place on March 5. In the case, which pitted the academy against various ticket brokers who allegedly sold or tried to sell tickets to the Oscars, an investigator for the academy who solicited tickets was told by a broker he should consider: ""a pair of Oscar tickets ($30K) total. For a little more, they could turn this into a once-in-a-lifetime experience that they will both cherish forever. Also, please note that the price will increase significantly next year, probably to $30K per person."" The academy has reached a negotiated settlement with most of the defendants and will be sending out a letter, as it does every year, reminding them and others that Oscar tickets may be used only by the lucky few who actually are eligible to receive them.

They said that the victim, Walter Everhardt, 24, was shot several times in the head and body in front of 158 West 131st Street about 7:20 p.m. Investigators said he ran down the street and collapsed as he was trying to enter a grocery story on the corner of West 131st Street and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard. ""He hits the door, falls backwards and he's dead,"" said an investigator on the scene. Mr. Everhardt did not live at 158 West 131st Street, but had relatives there, said Katrice Davis, 18, a niece who lives in the building. JENNIFER 8.

2005-12-22,Munich Bombed Anew,"“Munich” has become this year’s cinematic piñata, with various Oscar watchers and political hands beating on it with sticks in hopes that it will finally burst apart at the seams. One of the more vivid slams on its prospects – he sets some kind of record for use of boxing metaphors in a single item – comes from Jeffrey Wells at Hollywood Elsewhere. It’s funny, and effective, but once you jump down the hobbit hole of Oscar prognostications as the Carpetbagger has, you find out that there is no end to the deconstruction and analysis. He will be in need of serious deprogramming by the time the actual awards roll around in March, including spending a month with dial-up access only and some really good books from the Western canon to regain parts of his I.Q. Let’s skip the “Pride & Prejudice” (or any other Jane Austen) just to speed the process. (For those who are interested, Wells suggests in our comments section that the Carpetbagger has tagged him as a terrorist. That’s just plain silly. I was thinking more linguistic Unabomber.)",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/munich-bombed-anew/
2005-12-22,Critical Heat,"If you are looking for deep analysis, and we mean deep, of the movies who have received the most lavish, sloppy kisses from the critics, stop on over to the Critic’s Top Ten List. “Brokeback” is the obvious pet pony, but there are surprises down the list, including the appearance of “Grizzly Man,” Werner Herzog’s portrait of obsession tht the Carpetbagger can’t stop watching. His wife and daughter think Timothy Treadwell is an absolute freak and that the Carpetbagger needs to let go of his inner-bear, but we can’t stop looking. Whatever happened to those cute little foxes, anyway. And “History of Violence” continues to creep up the list. As the supposed prohibitive favorites pick up ack-ack of one kind or another, David Cronenberg’s look at the downside of redemption starts to look pretty damn smart. And Mario Bello’s turn as a wife who comes to know her husband by turns is a remarkable and meaty performance in a year when even the A-list had to settle for some less-than-nutritious roles.

Of course, fans of Mr. Daniels, whose characters generally make a virtue of opaqueness, will have to forgive and forget “Love Hurts” and “Chasing Sleep,” which should be a simple matter because most of us missed them with a quickness.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/not-so-plain-vanilla/

2005-12-22,"The Great, Grand Oscar DVD That Never Was","Use your best Andy Rooney voice here: Did you ever wonder why… there is no DVD of the Oscars? An industry that is increasingly built on those shiny little discs does not produce one celebrating the glitziest events on the planet? Turns out that a myriad of releases and one-time-use approvals are necessary to produce the live show, and it would be a nightmare if they had to include provisions for the production of a DVD memorializing the event. As it turns out, the Academy produced a VHS a few years ago called “Oscar’s Greatest Moments” and had to go through the clown’s mouth and over the windmill to clear rights and the whole thing ended up being such a pain in Oscar’s shiny rear that they decided it wasn’t worth it. So if you want to relive those golden moments this year, set the DVR on stun and make sure that you only enjoy the recording in the privacy of your own domicile.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/the-great-grand-oscar-dvd-that-never-was/

2005-12-22,We’re Not Worthy. Or Interested?,"As we have gotten started, the Carpetbagger has zoomed in and out of the comments section, hoping to find a throbbing tribe of Oscar fetishishs. There are a few hardy souls, and one windy one in particular, but for the most part, it’s a little quiet in here. Perhaps it’s because the Carpetbagger has dubbed some of the contributors Rugrats. Maybe I need to think of another honorific, something that clearly communicates the heft and interests of our contributors, something like … Baggies. Send thoughts about that if you have them. So anyway, Zimmergirl, a sassy contributor, who admits that she didn’t read the Carpetbagger’s prolix missive from yesterday about scalpers and the Oscars, sounded as if she wouldn’t go if she were paid. She has a friend — don’t we all? –who went to the Oscars and it did not go well: “She had to sit up in the nosebleeds (there really aren’t nosebleeds at the Kodak) and her only comment from the entire night (it was a disappointing Oscar ceremony where the worst possible film won, nothing new there) was that ‘Julia Roberts has a weird nose.’ So there you go. Watching them on TV is the only way to go. Besides, we really should know our place among gods and goddesses. We don’t REALLY DESERVE to be among them.” The Carpetbagger bows to the brilliance and straightforwardness of Zimmergirl’s analytics.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/were-not-worthy-or-interested/
2005-12-22,"Oscar Isn’t Gay, But He Is Liberal","A story in Reuters suggests that the smoke is beginning to clear in the Best Picture race and what it seems to reveal is two cowboys riding through the high lonesome and finding solace and companionship in the tent. “ ‘Brokeback,’ the first gay romance to make a bid for mainstream respectability, has already won the top awards handed out by critics in New York and Los Angeles and copped seven nominations for the January 16 Golden Globes, often a key indicator as to which way the Oscar wind might be blowing,” the story says. There is a reminder down low in the story that “Munich” must not be counted out and of course, the caveat remains that many early leaders in past Oscar races came up lame before the finish line. Like many, the Carpetbagger is exceedingly fond of “Brokeback Mountain” – he held hands with a friend during some of the more rugged parts, but that was just in the spirit of male bonding – but wonders whether the demographics of the Academy, which skew toward the ancient, will accommodate a full-on, smack-on-the-lips cowboy love story.

But a thought occurred to him – actually it came to him from a brilliant Oscar autodidact who would throttle the Carpetbagger if he revealed his name. To wit, after more or less co-writing – he wrote the good parts – the Carpetbagger’s take on how hard and ultimately futile it is to get into the Oscars, he said, “If the security at the ’72 Olympics had been as good as security at the Oscars, there would be no ‘Munich’ to nominate.” Wish I’d thought of that.

Once they were there, however, they had to convert part of the money back to animals so that they could be sacrificed, because the tithe had to be animals and first fruits, not money…. So the money changers were actually a legitimate service of the Temple, helping people fulfill their religious duties — not whatever debased slur has entered into popular, ignorant misunderstanding.” Sounds plausible, and if so, my apologies to the Association of Temple Money Changers.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/sorry-temple-money-changers/

2005-12-23,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; FELIX SCHRAMM: 'COMBER',"Destruction and creation have long gone hand in hand in modern art, sometimes indistinguishably, as in Jean Tinguely's self-destroying machine from 1960 called ""Homage to New York."" A recent entrant to the destruction-creation field is Felix Schramm, a young German sculptor whose large environmental sculptures made of lumber, drywall, paint and other Home Depot-type materials give the impression that part of a house has undergone some violent calamity. For his first New York solo exhibition, Mr. Schramm has produced a room-filling, tilting and disheveled configuration of walls and corners (above). It looks as though parts of an existing house had been ripped off, mixed up and slammed into the gallery by a passing tornado or -- as the title, ""Comber,"" suggests -- by an ocean wave. The effect is viscerally physical and art-historically resonant. Cubism, Kurt Schwitters's ""Merzbau,"" Gordon Matta-Clark's architectural deconstructions and the junk sculptures of John Chamberlain and Nancy Rubins all come to mind. There is no obvious narrative or symbolic intention, but because Mr. Schramm uses the forms and materials of vernacular residential construction, his installation can't help but call to mind real-world anxieties about threats to our safety -- political, meteorological, seismic and otherwise. The home is no longer a protective haven from the unpredictable flux of modernity and neither is the art gallery. It is impressive that Mr. Schramm achieves all this not by acts of real destruction or deconstruction but by carefully calibrated design and assembly.

2005-12-23,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; 'ECLIPSE: VISIONS OF THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS',"Abdel R. Salaam came to dance almost accidentally as a student and athlete at Lehman College in the 1970's. But it didn't take him long to ponder why his college dance teacher talked about the predictability of black students like Mr. Salaam recycling Alvin Ailey in their choreography classes. Why then, he wondered, was it permissible for white students to redo Twyla Tharp? Mr. Salaam likes to think about what lies behind accepted truths. Twenty years ago he founded a company, Forces of Nature, that blended traditional West African and modern dance in distinctive ways, well before that choreographic technique became fashionable. The lithe, stretched bodies of late-20th-century modern dance surged through dance that told the stories of the creation of the world and of black American myths, with intensity and an appreciation for the power of ritual. Now, he and his vibrant company will tackle the historical and cultural conflicts and confluences, as he puts it, of Christianity and Islam in ""Eclipse: Visions of the Crescent and the Cross""(above). Mr. Salaam, who has described himself as ""an ecumenical Muslim,"" combines ballet, hip-hop, martial-arts techniques and even Irish dancing with his more familiar African-contemporary mix in the new work, a journey that begins with the ancient Moors and winds its way through history up to the teaching of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. The score ranges from music by M'bemba Bangoura and Paul Winter, with whom his troupe has performed, to Gregorian chants and Islamic prayers. And the list of guest artists leading the multiracial cast reads like a Who's Who of black modern-dance performers, among them Sarita Allen, Dyane Harvey and Nathan Trice. (Forces of Nature will present the premiere of ""Eclipse: Visions of the Crescent and the Cross"" on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Aaron Davis Hall, City College, 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, www.forcesofnature.org; $25 to $45.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/23/arts/movies/the-listings-dec-23-dec-29-eclipse-visions-of-the-crescent-and.html

2005-12-23,The Listings: Dec. 23 - Dec. 29; ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND,"Of all the young musicians to emerge during jazz's major-label prospecting boom of the late 1980's and early 90's, few have stayed in the game like the trumpeter Roy Hargrove. Since his discovery by Wynton Marsalis in 1987, Mr. Hargrove, above, has ranked among his generation's leading proponents of hard bop, with fruitful detours into symphonic strings, Cuban groove and neo-soul. He caused a minor stir in 2003 with the RH Factor, an electric project trafficking in soul, gospel and R & B, along with a sprinkling of organic hip-hop; the group's debut, ""Hard Groove"" (Verve), featured guest turns by the singers D'Angelo and Erykah Badu and the rappers Q-Tip and Common. At the same time, Mr. Hargrove toured in a postbop band with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the saxophonist Michael Brecker, and he never stopped working with his longstanding acoustic quintet. If it all suggests a double life, that's not far off the mark: Mr. Hargrove's forthcoming album, ""Reflections and Distractions,"" will feature one disc of hard bop and another of RH Factor groove. (The album is scheduled for release in late-February on Verve.) Next week Mr. Hargrove will bring his sharp and assertive trumpet playing, along with his less heralded arranging skills, to yet another ensemble: a 17-piece big band stocked with colleagues like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Darren Barrett and the drummer Greg Hutchinson. The setting will lend the engagement a historical tone -- Mr. Hargrove first convened his big band 10 years ago in the space that is now the Jazz Gallery -- but the music should leave nostalgia behind. (Wednesday through Dec. 30 at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $25.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/23/arts/movies/the-listings-dec-23-dec-29-roy-hargrove-big-band.html

The holiday run is becoming something of a tradition for the group -- the bassist James McNew, above front, and the husband-and-wife team of Ira Kaplan on guitar and Georgia Hubley on drums -- and for this, their fourth Hanukkah series since 2001, they'll perform songs from their own catalog, ranging from squallers like ""Tom Courtney"" to quiescent relationship odes like the beckoning ""My Little Corner of the World."" But they'll also welcome, on various nights (along with comic M.C.'s to be announced), opening acts like the New Zealand rockers the Mad Scene, the jazzy Chicago polymaths Tortoise, the Sun Ra Arkestra directed by Marshall Allen, the naïf rock group Half Japanese and the singer-songwriter Lois, as well as fellow 80's indie veterans the Volcano Suns and the Scene Is Now. For all the comedy and frivolity on hand, one assumes there will be no shortage of seriousness. After all, this is a band that refashioned Sun Ra's ""Nuclear War"" as an all-purpose anthem of political disgust and wrote a love samba, ""Center of Gravity,"" in praise of sometimes frustrating earthly attachments.

2005-12-23,"What’s Next, Peace in the Middle East?","Although Christmas may not be a significant holiday inflection point for Steven Spielberg, it came early this year. After weeks of a mostly unseen “Munich” getting knocked around, the critics are weighing in, and it’s mostly with bon bons. At the New York Times, Manohla Dargis said all of the controversy was much fuss about not much: “Mr. Spielberg is doing nothing more radical here than advancing the idea that dialogue ends when two enemies, held hostage by dusty history and hot blood, have their hands locked around each other’s throats.” And Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly hands Spielberg a big fat “A,” calling the film “a thriller that seeps into your central nervous system.” According to Slate’s David Edelstein, “Munich is the most potent, the most vital, the best movie of the year.” (Still, some of Spielberg’s antagonists are still armed with intelligence and remain dangerous as a rule.

2005-12-23,For Your Manipulation,"In myriad ads offered For Your Consideration — and the Carpetbagger’s, incidentally, who channels as a member of the Academy to inhabit the collective mind of that body — George Clooney is offered as a candidate for best supporting actor in “Syriana.” As my colleague Ed Wyatt pointed out after seeing the movie, who exactly is he supposed to be secondary to? The movie opens on his surprisingly beefy mug and balances on his shoulders for much of the rest of the way. Yes, it is a movie that has an ensemble that is played through a prismatic narrative, but in acting terms – give or take a smashing Matt Damon assist – the movie belongs to him. Let us stipulate that Mr. Clooney is a Good Guy who makes Wonderful Movies about Important Topics. Yes, he is a triple-threat wonder this year who will be doing laps to the podium, but what, beyond studio artifice, has him competing in a supporting role? Call it the “Traffic” effect. Benicio Del Toro, a leading man’s leading man, won best supporting actor in 2000 because he was pitched that way. Now the Carpetbagger was born at night, but not last night, so he knows that the awards are subject to the wiles of marketing and manipulation, but here’s hoping that Clooney gets his due for writing, producing, and directing more quality in a single year than most filmmakers accomplish in a lifetime. And if the Academy is just going damp in the pants to give gorgeous George a supporting nod, why not give it to him for his turn as Fred Friendly in “Good Night, and Good Luck,” where he ably and honorably supported his star, David Strathairn?

The decision to eliminate the shows came one week after the ballet canceled its production of ""The Nutcracker,"" which was expected to make enough money to help finance the 2006-7 season. The dancers say they need a new contract to protect their jobs, safety and health. The company says problems revolve around artistic control. The season ends in May.

2005-12-26,'The Worst Hard Time'," They had been on the road for six days, a clan of five bouncing along in a tired wagon, when Bam White woke to some bad news. One of his horses was dead. It was the nineteenth-century equivalent of a flat tire, except this was the winter of 1926. The Whites had no money. They were moving from the high desert chill of Las Animas, Colorado, to Littlefield, Texas, south of Amarillo, to start anew. Bam White was a ranch hand, a lover of horses and empty skies, at a time when the cowboy was becoming a museum piece in Texas and an icon in Hollywood. Within a year, Charles Lindbergh would cross the ocean in his monoplane, and a white man in blackface would speak from the screen of a motion picture show. The great ranches had been fenced, platted, subdivided, upturned, and were going out to city builders, oil drillers, and sodbusters. The least-populated part of Texas was open for business and riding high in the Roaring Twenties. Overnight, new towns were rising, bustling with banks, opera houses, electric streetlights, and restaurants serving seafood sent by train from Galveston. With his handlebar mustache, bowlegs, and raisin-skinned face, Bam White was a man high-centered in the wrong century.

The thing is, it all happened so fast, was over practically before it began, that we can almost be forgiven for misconstruing her as a cultural simulacrum: a blip on the monitor, a media invention, an adorable incarnation of a feminine ideal of the reluctant or unwitting nymphet, rather than a flesh-and-blood creature with needs and wishes (not to mention raging demons) of her own. The lightning speed with which Sandra Dee was first heralded and then discarded may have been just another example of the ""now you see her, now you don't"" phenomenon endemic to the fever-dream of Hollywood, but it also suggests the dark ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" side of the American manufacture of celebrity -- the ruthlessness that drives it and the despair it feeds off. She went from being discovered in 1956, at 12, to winning a Golden Globe Award in 1958, to being hailed by The Motion Picture Herald in 1959 as the ""Number One Star of Tomorrow,"" based on her promising pigtailed debut in the sterling weepie ""Until They Sail"" as well as her performance in ""The Reluctant Debutante.""

Since starting out in the late 1980's, he has established himself as the leader of the Onkyo movement in improvising, which insists on pure sonic texture as a basis for sound, rather than structure. At the same time, with his New Jazz Orchestra, he has hired musicians with the chops to concoct new versions of venerable jazz compositions, with considerable emphasis on structure. (The latest, on the Japanese label Doubtmusic, is a fascinating album-length take on Eric Dolphy's 1964 recording ""Out to Lunch."") Sunday through Friday, he will be the focus and the star of a mini-festival at the Stone, highlighting different aspects of his work every night. But don't expect jazz. The concerts include solo performances with turntables or guitar; a trio with the bassist BILL LASWELL and the drummer NAKAMURA TATSUYA; a quartet with the bassist MARGARITA GARCIA and the percussionists SEAN MEEHAN and TIM BARNES; and collaborations with other electronic musicians like YASUNAO TONE and IKUE MORI. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; $10 per set.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/arts/the-week-ahead-dec-25-dec-31-popjazz.html

Articulated and crisply recorded, the album isn't just a collection of persistent ideals in jazz -- with clarity of melody and rhythm, lovely groove (the crisply swinging, underrecorded Shadow Wilson is the drummer) and constant surprise in the moving harmonies -- but a fantastically pleasurable record.

The interesting thing about Hunter has never been his soporific movies, like ""Island of Desire"" or ""Lust in the Dust,"" or even his treacly 1957 hit single, ""Young Love."" It's himself. In his memoir, Hunter provides a mesmerizing account of his Candide-like journey through Hollywood. Never a gifted actor, Hunter, who grew up in Southern California, rode his all-American looks to a seven-year studio contract with Warner Brothers, which signed him up at age 23 and transformed him almost overnight into a teeny-bopper idol. The twist, of course, was that Hunter, like any number of Hollywood leading men, was gay. He soon chafed under a rigid studio system that seemed designed to wring any lingering vestiges of spontaneity out of filmmakers and actors, though it had some advantages. It offered not only a steady salary, but protection from scurrilous rags like Confidential magazine, which sought to out the stars of the day. Hunter offers shrewd assessments of the studio moguls Jack Warner and Harry Cohn, as well as hilarious anecdotes about working with Natalie Wood, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner. After Warner Brothers cut him loose, Hunter's career stalled, but how sorry can you feel for someone who was whizzing around Capri and hanging out with Ingrid Bergman in his mid-20's? His foray into Tinseltown's past should help revive his name, but not, one suspects, his films.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html

The 134 books, taken from the Sarospatak College of the Hungarian Reformist Church, are among countless paintings, archives and other items taken as trophy art from Germany and Eastern Europe. They have been kept in Nizhny Novgorod, a city where numerous paintings that once belonged to Jews living in Hungary are also held. The Duma must take another vote on the bill next year, but that is considered a formality. A number of stolen cultural treasures were also returned to Russia last week. The Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, presented Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church with 74 icons from the 18th and 19th centuries that had been smuggled out of Russia and were seized in a joint operation with agents from Cyprus.

2005-12-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WITTING, CHRIS J.","WITTING--Chris J. A pioneer in the early days of television, business executive, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and community leader, died peacefully at his home in Syracuse, NY on December 19. He was 90 years old. Witting retired as chairman, chief executive officer, and director of the CrouseHinds Company (now known as Cooper Crouse-Hinds) in 1982. Under his leadership, beginning in 1965, annual sales at Crouse-Hinds grew from $50 million to almost $900 million, and the company became listed on the Fortune 500. New product introductions and acquisitions over the years helped to transform the modest electrical equipment firm into the world leader in aviation lighting products in the mid-70s, with subsidiaries in South America, Europe and Australia. Witting was known for his belief in the power of individuals and positive thinking. His management style was to empower his employees, delegating responsibility and giving them every incentive to improve their skills and advance. He was often quoted as saying, ""Everyone should be Number One in something. It doesn't matter what that is. Since you spend most of your life working, you may as well be the best in your field."" A firm believer in the importance of giving back to the community, he was both an industry and civic leader. He served as president of the Manufacturers Association of Syracuse, chairman of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, and a member, board member, and director of numerous other groups, including the Everson Museum, Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York, and Syracuse Symphony Orchestra. In 1973 the Syracuse Herald-American named him ""Man of the Year."" His contributions were recognized with numerous awards. He held honorary degrees from Clarkson College, LeMoyne College, and Syracuse University. In 1996, Representative James T. Walsh (N.Y.) paid him tribute in Congress, calling him ""a true civic leader, a man who has not only led the way for manufacturing interests in Central New York, but has touched the lives of thousands of his fellow citizens with his philanthropy, his counsel, and his encouragement."" Witting began his career as a public accountant at Price Waterhouse in New York City. He worked his way through college, earning a B.S. from NYU in 1941. That same year, Price Waterhouse assigned him to Camp Shows USA (later USO Camp Shows), for which he directed all financial work as treasurer and comptroller. During his tenure as executive vice president, Camp Shows had 10,000 entertainers working in all areas where servicemen and women were stationed during World War II. A leading figure in the early years of television, Witting developed the Allen B. Dumont organization from a six-man group to 800 personnel, operating wholly owned stations in New York, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC, as well as a TV network relationship in 58 cities. Dumont became the first commercial operating television network in the country, with regularly scheduled news broadcast from Washington, DC to New York City. Witting is credited with having brought Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Jackie Gleason, Dennis James, and Bishop Sheen to network TV. He left Dumont in 1953 to become president of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. While he was at Westinghouse Broadcasting, every Westinghouse radio and TV station was rated number one in its market. Witting later joined the parent company in Pittsburgh, as group vice president in charge of the electronic components and consumer products divisions. In 1964 he moved to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. (ITT) in New York City, serving as second in command to the president and chairman, Harold Geneen. At ITT Witting directed the world headquarters marketing, manufacturing, and technical activities, as well as two subsidiaries, ITT Export Corp. and Distributed Products Co. He remained active long after his 1982 retirement, operating his own investment company. He devoted his efforts to helping others achieve business success, not only investing in local companies, but also endowing the Witting Chair in Entrepreneurship at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management. Throughout his long life, Witting enjoyed the outdoors, camping, hiking, and doing chores on his property. Nearly every day he rose before dawn to go jogging, accompanied by one of his beloved dogs, no matter what the weather. For some 35 years he made sure that family members stayed close by hosting an annual reunion at his home for the extended Witting clan, who traveled from all parts of the country to be there. He also maintained a cottage in New Jersey for use by his family. It was a Sears house that he built himself after returning from Europe at the end of World War II. He is survived by his devoted wife, Marshia (Pullman) Witting, sons Leland Witting and Chris Witting Jr., daughters Anne W. Kuhn and Nancy Witting, seven grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren. He was predeceased by his first wife, Grace (Orrok) Witting, and his brother, Nicholas Witting Jr. Funeral services private. Burial St. Mary's Cemetery, DeWitt. There are no calling hours.

The network's two-hour ""Kennedy Center Honors"" drew 10.85 million viewers. But because that special's largest demographic appeal was to viewers 50 and older, NBC was able to easily win the night among 18-to-49-year-olds.

Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe.

Her versatile, intimate brand of entertainment is not unlike an act that you might have seen in the glory days of Las Vegas.

In the right role, Ms. Bernhard, a mother who still looks sexy in a see-through dress (she is better preserved than Dick Clark), can be a decent actress, but she always seems most comfortable playing herself -- or at least the acid and soulful persona that passes for herself in her solo shows.

The State of South Carolina, which was filed more than 12 years ago and is considered a bellwether for other states that have taken similar tacks to increase school financing. According to the Access network, a nonprofit organization that tracks school financing issues, lawsuits challenging state methods of financing public schools have been filed in 45 states. Gov.

Today, after difficult adjustments to globalization and the precipitous devaluation of the peso from around 3 to the dollar to nearly 11 over 12 years - often cited as a cause for a spike in crimes like kidnapping and robbery - the city remains a teeming, vibrant and joyful place.

2005-12-30,The Listings: Dec. 30 - Jan. 5; PRESERVATION HALL JAZZ BAND/DR. MICHAEL WHITE'S ORIGINAL LIBERTY JAZZ BAND,"When the clock strikes 12 tomorrow night, it will mean the end of a year that most New Orleans natives would rather forget. But forgetting isn't common practice in that city, especially where culture is concerned; many of its best and brightest were haunted by history well before Hurricane Katrina raised the stakes. In the early 1960's, one such individual, the tuba-playing jazz advocate Allan Jaffe, formed the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, an ensemble trafficking in New Orleans jazz and stocked with veteran musicians. Now under the stewardship of the trumpeter John Brunious, a lifelong member, and the bassist Ben Jaffe, who upholds his father's mission, the band has been touring almost incessantly since being displaced. This week's Jazz Standard engagement culminates in a New Year's Eve package, complete with barbecue dinner and Champagne toast. Across town, Champagne and New Orleans polyphony will also pour forth at the Village Vanguard, where the Original Liberty Jazz Band has played more than a dozen New Year's Eve engagements over the years. This year's installment will be more poignant than most, of course: although the musicians all survived Katrina, the band's clarinetist and leader, Dr. Michael White, a prominent historian and scholar of New Orleans culture at Xavier University of Louisiana, suffered the incalculable loss of his collection of antique instruments, documents and rare recordings. A tinge of defiance will accompany the jubilation of the music, which serves not only to usher in a new year but also to highlight the process of renewal that jazz, at its best, is all about. (The Preservation Hall Jazz Band plays tonight at 8, 10 and 11:45, and tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $35; $125 to $175 tomorrow, including a three-course dinner.

Both shows are certain to include plenty of off-color remarks, audience harassment and participation, low-tech props and improper song and dance routines performed by a variety of special guests hailing from the burlesque and downtown scene, including Miss Saturn, Carmine Covelli, People Lution and some surprises. As always, the shows feature Lance Cruce on piano, and the Murrayettes, flatteringly described by Murray Hill as ""aging showgirls."" Bawdy and silly in a charmingly unpolished way, these dancers and singers perform broad physical comedy as well as choreographed numbers. Get there early for a good seat or reserve a table, but avoid the front row unless you are willing to bear the brunt of Murray Hill's leers and merciless one-liners. Those wishing to make a night of it can sign up for a special four-course meal before the shows. They don't call it the House of Satisfaction for nothing.

The Godfather of Soul spent the first part of 2005 recovering from prostate surgery and fielding lingering questions about his much publicized 2004 marital strife and domestic abuse problems. It was reality TV fodder all the way. Now, this hard-living 73-year-old reportedly has in the works both a ""Ray""-like biopic and a documentary (produced by his wife, Tomi Rae) called ""Life on the Road With Mr. and Mrs. Brown."" If his legendary stage show has lost some of its kinetic kick -- those legs don't shuffle and split as they used to -- Mr. Brown's huff and growl are as percussive as ever. His band still freezes and blares at the slightest signal from its leader, and he still falls to his knees as the spirit dictates. Shows in recent years have included overenthusiastic dancers, as well as a drooping sequence in which Mrs. Brown wails a few Janis Joplinesque numbers. The rhinestone-bedecked main attraction may stick stubbornly to his biggest hits, but who can argue with a searing rendition of ""It's a Man's World,"" a buoyant ""I Feel Good"" or a stripped-down ""Sex Machine""? The pleading showstopper ""Please, Please, Please"" seems to be a live rarity now, but maybe the mood will strike. For his part, Mr. Brown knows that among other achievements, he continues to be the most sampled man in the rap biz. To trade on his legacy, all he needs to do is to keep making it funky and, of course, stay on the scene.

2005-12-30,"At City Ballet, Some Especially Catch the Eye; Ashley Bouder","Ashley Bouder is one of the most exciting dance artists to come along in recent years. Her repertory for the winter season is likely to include five classics by George Balanchine -- ""Symphony in C"" (third movement), ""Ballo della Regina,"" ""Firebird,"" ""Divertimento No. 15"" and ""Union Jack"" -- and the company director Peter Martins's ""Octet."" But ""Firebird"" is hers in a special way. She claimed the title role when she stepped into it on the ballet equivalent of a moment's notice in 2001 as a 17-year-old corps dancer. She was astonishing, and continues to be. She can probably dance just about any technical trick in the book, but her daring, her dazzling clarity and her musical phrasing shine through. And the Firebird is likely to be a role when the fleeting old-time glamour Ms. Bouder has been acquiring of late, reminiscent of ballerinas of the 1940's, can best be enjoyed.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/30/arts/movies/at-city-ballet-some-especially-catch-the-eye-ashley-bouder.html

Early in her career she was proclaimed an exceptional interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and with her success in the Naumburg Competition of 1943 her career was launched. She appeared in recital, in duo recital with Abram Chasins, to whom she was married from 1949 until his death in 1987, and with the leading orchestras of the day. Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe. Our fond memories of Constance will continue to enrich us, as will her recordings and the artistry of her celebrated pupils. We convey our love and heartfelt condolences to her husband Milton.

Today, after difficult adjustments to globalization and the precipitous devaluation of the peso from around 3 to the dollar to nearly 11 over 12 years -- often cited as a cause for a spike in crimes like kidnapping and robbery -- the city remains a teeming, vibrant and joyful place. Even the skies are blue again because of new laws that restrict auto use.

United States pipe makers and a labor group, which strongly condemned the president's decision, asked the Bush administration to impose the quotas on certain kinds of steel pipe used primarily in construction. They argued that a surge in imports from China was disrupting markets. The International Trade Commission sided with the companies and recommended that the president provide relief. Mr. Bush rejected that, saying it was not in the best interest of the economy. (AP)",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/business/business-briefs.html

The House of Steinway & Sons deeply mourns the passing of the eminent American pianist Constance Keene, in New York City on December 24, 2005 at the age of 84. Constance Keene was a treasured member of our family of Steinway Artists for fiftytwo years. Early in her career she was proclaimed an exceptional interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and with her success in the Naumburg Competition of 1943 her career was launched. She appeared in recital, in duo recital with Abram Chasins, to whom she was married from 1949 until his death in 1987, and with the leading orchestras of the day. Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe. Our fond memories of Constance will continue to enrich us, as will her recordings and the artistry of her celebrated pupils. We convey our love and heartfelt condolences to her husband Milton.

Friedman makes a compelling case that a ""triple convergence"" of Internet technology with economic and political events at the dawn of the 21st century has generated ""more horizontal and collaborative"" means of creating value. While warning of several dangers lurking in this global topology, he celebrates the more level playing field and the breathtaking variety of opportunities for those with the imagination and technical training to seize them.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/sports/othersports/the-poker-world-is-flat-part-1.html

2006-01-02,Closing Time; Iskandariya,"It was not a scorpion I asked for, I asked for a fish, but maybe God misheard my request, maybe God thought I said not ""some sort of fish,"" but a ""scorpion fish,"" a request he would surely have granted, being a goodly God, but then he forgot the ""fish"" attached to the ""scorpion"" (because God, too, forgets, everything forgets); so instead of an edible fish, any small fish, sweet or sour, or even the grotesque buffoonery of the striped scorpion fish, crowned with spines and followed by many tails, a veritable sideshow of a fish; instead of these, I was given an insect, a peculiar prehistoric creature, part lobster, part spider, part bell-ringer, part son of a fallen star, something like a disfigured armored dog, not a thing you can eat, or even take on a meaningful walk, so ugly is it, so stiffly does it step, as if on ice, freezing again and again in mid-air like a listening ear, and then scuttling backwards or leaping madly forward, its deadly tail doing a St. Vitus jig. God gave me a scorpion, a venomous creature, to be sure, a bug with the bite of Cleopatra's asp, but not, as I soon found out, despite the dark gossip, a lover of violence or a hater of men. In truth, it is shy, the scorpion, a creature with eight eyes and almost no sight, who shuns the daylight, and is driven mad by fire, who favors the lonely spot, and feeds on nothing much, and only throws out its poison barb when backed against a wall -- a thing like me, but not the thing I asked for, a thing, by accident or design, I am now attached to. And so I draw the curtains, and so I lay out strange dishes, and so I step softly, and so I do not speak, and only twice, in many years, have I been stung, both times because, unthinking, I let in the terrible light. And sometimes now, when I watch the scorpion sleep, I see how fine he is, how rare, this creature called Lung Book or Mortal Book because of his strange organs of breath. His lungs are holes in his body, which open and close. And inside the holes are stiffened membranes, arranged like the pages of a book -- imagine that! And when the holes open, the pages rise up and unfold, and the blood that circles through them touches the air, and by this bath of air the blood is made pure . . . He is a house of books, my shy scorpion, carrying in his belly all the perishable manuscripts -- a little mirror of the library at Alexandria, which burned.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/opinion/closing-time-iskandariya.html
