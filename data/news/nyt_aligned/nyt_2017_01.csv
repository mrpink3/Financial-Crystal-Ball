At his new Greenwich Village restaurant, opening in mid-January, Matt Abdoo, the former chef de cuisine at Del Posto and the chef and partner in the rustic, mostly outdoor Pig Beach in Gowanus, Brooklyn, is making barbecue with high-end flourishes. He’ll be serving ravioli filled with smoked brisket in red-wine sauce and truffle butter, silky cod cheeks with crispy country ham and vinegar peppers, smoked duck confit with a sweet-and-sour glaze, a tomahawk chop and that must-have at cocktail events, pigs in blankets. “I wanted to elevate what I was doing at Pig Beach,” he said. “Smoke is a theme here, but it’s more refined.” To make it clear that this light and airy restaurant, decorated with some midcentury modern elements, is not just about barbecue, he’s also serving seafood and vegetable dishes. Wines come from around the world, and there’s a clever winter julep with rye on the cocktail list. As at Pig Beach, his partners are the chefs Ed McFarland and Shane McBride, but they are not in the kitchen. Pig Beach will close in February to add more indoor space, and will reopen in May (Opens Jan. 17): 155 Bleecker Street (Thompson Street), 646-756-5115.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/dining/pig-bleecker-barbecue-greenwich-village-restaurant-news.html

2017-01-04,A Chilling PBS Documentary Shows How Mistakes Are Made,"President-elect Donald J. Trump stirred up the debate over nuclear weapons with a late-December Twitter post, but one aspect of that issue is rarely explored: Nuclear armaments have to be safely stored and maintained somewhere. Just why this matters is chillingly detailed in “Command and Control,” an episode of “American Experience” on PBS on Tuesday, Jan. 10, that recounts a 1980 maintenance blunder at a missile silo in Arkansas. The incident, which seemed as if it might obliterate a large part of that state, began with that most human of mistakes, a dropped piece of equipment. It punctured the fuel tank on a Titan missile, and the resulting chaos, recounted by those who experienced the moment, is alarming. The program is part of a theme week on PBS that also includes “Containment,” an “Independent Lens” film about nuclear waste, on Monday; and “The Nuclear Option,” a “Nova” episode about nuclear power, on Wednesday. A rebroadcast of the 2015 program “Uranium: Twisting the Dragon’s Tail” follows the Nova episode.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/arts/television/a-chilling-pbs-documentary-shows-how-mistakes-are-made.html

More open to experimentation (and women) than dealer-run galleries, the “10th Street Scene” accommodated the formation of installation art and happenings, early glimmers of Pop Art and Minimalism, as well as the persistence of painterly figuration.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/arts/design/the-10th-street-scene-has-its-own-show.html

Perhaps that’s why it was chosen to be the opening film Wednesday, Jan. 11, at the New York Jewish Film Festival, which runs through Jan. 24. It’s the story of estranged sisters (Yaara Pelzig and Yuval Scharf) who have forged very different paths, one caring for their frail father, the other working at a hot Tel Aviv club. When events throw them back together, the chasm between them doesn’t simply disappear; it must be painstakingly bridged. Both the director and Ms. Scharf are to be on hand for Wednesday’s two screenings at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. The festival features 28 other films and shorts, an eclectic selection that includes “Shalom Rabin,” Amos Gitai’s diary of the time surrounding the Oslo Accords; “Bette Midler: The Divine Miss M,” in which Ms. Midler revisits career high points; and, for foodies, “Hummus! The Movie.” (nyjff.org)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/movies/new-york-jewish-film-festival-sisters-hummus-and-bette-midler.html

Now she sells jars at House of Voltaire, the annual pop-up store curated by the arts charity Studio Voltaire, and at her own shop just off East London’s Chatsworth Road, where she sells her small-batch conserves alongside ceramics, cookbooks and culinary paraphernalia.

2017-01-06,"With Rise of Body Cameras, New Tests of Transparency and Trust","Body-worn cameras are reshaping perceptions of policing. The small devices, typically mounted on officers’ shirts, provide a lens into law enforcement that is meant to build transparency and trust. But their increased use has also raised a host of questions and concerns: Who should have access to recordings? How will the footage be used? What are the privacy rights of people caught on video? And what are the long-term costs to taxpayers? Across the country, police departments large and small are rolling out expensive body-camera programs without consistent answers to the questions or, according to policy experts, convincing evidence that the cameras ensure the level of accountability that the public demands. Already, at least 19 states have enacted laws restricting public access to  footage, and a dozen more are proposing legislation. This four-chapter video series examines the challenges and incentives — social, political and economic — surrounding the rapid rise of police body cameras. Our story begins in Cincinnati, with a pitch for their use to officers in training.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/police-body-cameras.html

The reason I fought the “don’t ask, don’t tell” battle and the battle for women and transgender people in combat was the same reason I was at West Point: I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I fought to expand those opportunities because it was the right thing to do, but also because it would make my Army stronger.

(“The most interesting thing about the spraying from a big industrial gun,” Ms. Grosse said, “is that it makes you so much bigger.”) Now she arrives on perhaps the biggest commercial stage in the New York art world. Her first gallery show in the city, at Gagosian in Chelsea, opening Thursday, Jan. 19, features work from the past year that continues to blur the distinction between two and three dimensions, borne of the conviction, as she once said, that “paint has to be voluminous if it is to achieve presence.” (Through March 11; gagosian.com.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/arts/design/katharina-grosse-gallery-show.html

By then, she had also held a recurring role (leading a fictional band) in the series “Transparent”; done some modeling; and started writing Cherry Glazerr’s second album, “Apocalipstick,” out Friday, Jan. 20. She has soaked up a history of women’s punk, post-punk and grunge, glancing toward Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Go-Gos, Sleater-Kinney and Hole among others, and she makes melody a priority whether a song barrels ahead at punk speed or digs into a sharp-elbowed midtempo riff. On “Apocalipstick,” Cherry Glazerr has grown from three members to four, and it moves beyond the lo-fi sound and throwaway sarcasm of the band’s debut. Ms. Creevy, 19, has a lot on her mind: female solidarity, junk food, insecurity, wildness, even thoughts about professionalism. And she sings like she has most of the answers.

2017-01-12,How to Be Civil in an Uncivil World,"Americans seem to be forever undergoing a “crisis” of civility. Year after year, we’re told that the norms dictating decent behavior are eroding; that we’ve lost sight of the basic regard we owe our fellow participants in public life; that the contentiousness of our culture threatens to undermine our democracy. Worrisome stuff, of course — but a little vague. If, as any historian will tell you, people in all times and places have been alarmed by this development (the ancient Romans called it pugna verborum, or “the battle of words”), you might wonder how urgent, or even actual, the trouble really is. Then there’s the problem of definition. One man’s civility is another man’s repression. Were the Act Up protesters in the 1980s so indecorous as to disqualify themselves from political conversation, as their critics charged? Or were they the ones demanding civility, in the form of simple recognition of the lives of people with AIDS? Is Donald Trump dangerously boorish? Or is he, too, resisting an ersatz decorum, one he and his supporters call “political correctness,” which they claim honors the feelings of everyone but the beleaguered white working-class male?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/books/review/how-to-be-civil-in-an-uncivil-world.html

2017-01-13,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Resolved: January is self-help season — all those resolute readers, still nursing champagne hangovers and chocolate tummy aches, snatch up titles like “Food, Health and Happiness” (No. 1 on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list) and “The Lose Your Belly Diet” (No. 2 on the same list), which will linger for a month or so before giving way to funny cat books, only to resurface like freckles at the first sign of beach weather. It’s not all questionable science and impossible aspirations, though. “The Telomere Effect,” an anti-aging book new at No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, was written by a couple of honest-to-God scientists: Elizabeth Blackburn, president of the Salk Institute and a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine, and Elissa Epel, a health psychologist who directs the Aging, Metabolism and Emotion Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The quick version of their book, and their research, is that our chromosomes rely on protective caps (called telomeres) akin to the tips that keep shoelaces from fraying; healthy living, they claim, can preserve or even restore those caps to slow the effects of aging. “Move your body,” Blackburn advised listeners of WNYC radio this month, in an interview with the journalist Jonathan Capehart in which she also casually deployed the correct term for those shoelace tips. (They’re aglets.) “Everyone thinks, ‘Oh, I have to run marathons and join expensive gyms and things like that.’ It turns out really brisk walking, even for short periods of time every day, buffers or alleviates some of the stress-related telomere shortening that happens in chronically stressed people. This is very encouraging, because even if you have a short lunchtime, you can get out and really briskly walk 10 minutes every day. . . . It’s totally doable, and it’s free.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

The vivid paintings lining the Los Angeles gallery’s walls are visualizations of data gathered by the late black scholar and activist W.E.B. DuBois: the numbers of black people in post-Emancipation Georgia who owned land, who were once slaves, who had kitchen appliances and professional degrees and other markers of class. These figures have been beautifully abstracted into semblances of pie charts, swirling line graphs and color blocks. Elsewhere, the fraying, red-and-gray gradations of a wall-mounted tapestry are the flattened lengths of a fire hose, the principal weapon used against black civil rights activists in the 1960s. And poetry is embossed in gold capital letters on the spines of black-bound Jet magazines, lined up at eye-level on the gallery walls in tidy rows:",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/t-magazine/art/theaster-gates-web-dubois-but-to-be-a-poor-race.html

Friends scoff at this extravagant concern. “That couldn’t happen here in America, not possibly!” they assure him.

The pairing of Killer Mike, an Atlanta rapper who cut his teeth with Outkast in the early 2000s, and El-P, a producer and M.C. from Brooklyn who founded the influential label Definitive Jux, has paid surprisingly robust dividends for such disparate characters — their chemistry pays equal homage to rap’s golden era and its 21st-century potential.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/music/run-the-jewels-protest-songs.html
2017-01-19,"The Whitney Revisits the ’80s, a Decade of Macho and Money","It’s a dirty job, but someone has to jump-start serious reconsideration of that dark, amorphous phenomenon known as American painting in the 1980s — a veritable pit of macho swagger, nostalgia and money. Most New York museums have looked the other way, but on Friday, Jan. 27, the Whitney Museum of American Art will revisit this incredibly busy, visually rich if oft-maligned decade with the unveiling of “Fast Forward: Painting From the 1980s.” This show’s 37 artists will be represented by 41 works from the museum’s collection, mostly paintings, but also drawings and prints. Neo-Expressionism, abstraction, graffiti, feminism, Conceptualism, Pop and appropriation are among the tendencies, strategies and influences to be highlighted. The decade’s stars — including Julian Schnabel, David Salle and Kenny Scharf — will be shown alongside others who worked with less fanfare, like Nellie Mae Rowe, Kathe Burkhart and Carlos Alfonzo. If the show is not the full-on revisionist effort that the decade needs, it can’t help being a necessary beginning. (Through May 14; whitney.org.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/design/the-whitney-revisits-the-80s-a-decade-of-macho-and-money.html

One of them, “Outsiders,” begins its second season Tuesday, Jan. 24, with a high bar of crazy to clear if it wants to top Season 1. The show is about the Farrell clan, which has lived atop a mountain in Appalachia for several hundred years, keeping its distance from the world to the extent that it has even developed its own language (though these mountain men and women mostly speak in English). The Farrells’ way of life is threatened by the world down below and especially by a coal company that wants them evicted so it can mine the mountaintop, a plan that promises jobs and gives the series a current-events peg. Season 1 spent a lot of time on the Farrells’ internal power struggles. In Season 2, the outside world seems likely to be ever more intrusive. It’s a big week for WGN: On Wednesday, Jan. 25, its witch drama, “Salem,” which is even odder than “Outsiders,” has its series finale after three seasons.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/television/in-outsiders-theyre-under-siege-and-bracing-for-more.html

Noble virtues do not map neatly onto apex predators, a fact that troubled Benjamin Franklin as early as 1784.

For the pair — who met while studying men’s wear at the London College of Fashion — it was that experience that triggered a desire to set up a label together. “We felt we did it for someone else and now we wanted to do it for ourselves,” says Bakir. “Kanye is a workaholic and he pushed us to the limits but without that we wouldn’t be prepared for the hours involved in setting up our own brand.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/t-magazine/fashion/cmmn-swdn-mens-wear-emma-hedlund-saif-bakir.html

Recent Hollywood movies like “Moana” and “Finding Dory” display glistening waves, plump raindrops and churning ocean depths with gaudy trade-show flash. “The Red Turtle,” a feature by the Dutch animator Michael Dudok de Wit, hews to a quieter, proudly analog (or at least analog-evoking) approach.

Lots.","At once solemn and preposterous, sinister and sentimental, efficient and overwrought, “Split” represents something of a return to form for its writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan. Or maybe I should say a return to formula. The movie, shot in and around Philadelphia, Mr. Shyamalan’s hometown, proceeds nimbly and with suave misdirection toward a pair of rug-pulling final twists that an attentive viewer will probably be able to anticipate. It’s not exactly a Choose Your Own Adventure, but you can opt either for the pleasure of surprise at the end or for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle as you go along.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/split-review-m-night-shyamalan.html

Those types of plants require an open terrarium, anything from a vase to an old goldfish bowl. “You can even use an old mayonnaise jar,” Rudd says.

Under the right conditions, ivy can be found trailing along the ground where it forms thick mats that smother native vegetation. The vine also produces holdfasts, and is consequently an excellent tree climber, growing aggressively upward, eventually strangling its host. These modified roots also allow the plant to scramble over rocky ledges in its native landscape. Humans have found this characteristic especially useful as the plant gladly climbs walls, fences and posts in the sunniest exposures or the most dimly lit corners.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/nyregion/english-ivy-spread-by-admiring-humans-and-hungry-birds.html

Smick was Jack Kemp’s congressional chief of staff in the 1970s and ’80s, and he still leans Republican — he supported Marco Rubio’s presidential run and donated nearly $100,000 to Republican candidates in the last election cycle. But discussing the financial industry and its excesses, he can sound as fiery and populist as any Bernie Sanders stump speech. “The true shame of the 2008 financial crisis is that the big and the powerful were the most protected,” he writes. “It is clear why working families today are so angry. After 2008, if you were a failed, brain-dead Wall Street banker who nearly tanked the world economy, you had easy access to the Federal Reserve’s cheap liquidity. If you failed as a giant bank, you were considered special. Your bank could systemically bring down the entire financial system. But if you were a struggling enterprise out there alone with a brilliant idea that could someday employ thousands of people, obtaining financing was next to impossible. The normal sources of risk capital had dried up, but no one from Washington, D.C., was there with your safety net. The too-big-to-fail banks enjoyed a cost of borrowing far lower than other firms because financial markets became convinced government authorities would never let the big banks go under. The fix was in.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

At Prada in Milan, ornamental twigs dangled from feather and chain necklaces, offsetting looks of leather and fur. At the Loewe exhibition in Paris, Jonathan Anderson stayed tied to his penchant for the homemade, presenting chains with carved dogs’ heads along with earrings in the shape of miniature brass trumpets. And at Dries Van Noten, animal bone and teeth on a simple cord complemented oversize knitwear and slim-cut bluejeans.

During the campaign Trump got away with this in part because of slovenly, craven media, but also because of persistent misperceptions. The public consistently believes that crime is rising even when it has been falling to historical lows; it believes that the number of uninsured has risen when it has also fallen to historic lows; Republicans believe that unemployment is up and, incredibly, the stock market down under Obama.

But the humble part, you’ll notice, came first: As a self-educated frontier jack-of-many-trades, he was humble to begin with, not humbled by his own political success.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/calling-yourself-humbled-doesnt-sound-as-humble-as-it-used-to.html
2017-01-24,Will France Sound the Death Knell for Social Democracy?,"One afternoon in September, Franck Sailliot marched through the northern French city of Lille alongside a couple of thousand leftist trade unionists and students. The marchers waved union flags, blew whistles, bellowed slogans. “Enough, enough, enough of this society, where there’s only unemployment and insecurity!” they yelled. “We don’t want the law of the bosses! The only solution is to revoke it!” Sailliot, a 48-year-old trade unionist who had worked much of his adult life in a paper mill in a town about an hour’s drive to the east, shuffled along, mostly silent, his hands in his pockets. As the demonstrators made their way through Lille’s town center, passing the ornate 17th-century stock exchange, they shouted, “Fire the stockholders!” and “Everything they have, they stole it!” One man wielded a bloodied, severed mannequin head and waved a French flag emblazoned with the silhouette of Robespierre, who presided over the Reign of Terror. It was a revolution of sorts, but Sailliot seemed a bit bored. The French left has long protested the encroachment of an unbridled free market, and despite some victories in halting its progress, the overall trend was one of demoralizing defeat. Sailliot debated peeling off from the crowd early and grabbing a beer.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/will-france-sound-the-death-knell-for-social-democracy.html

2017-01-24,48 Hours With Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri,"On Saturday, while 673 women’s marches were taking place in cities across the world, Maria Grazia Chiuri, the new artistic director of Christian Dior, was fitting her spring/summer 2017 couture collection in Paris. She was wearing a T-shirt from her first Dior collection printed with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s line “We Should All Be Feminists,” worn underneath a black wool “Bar” jacket from the same collection, whose name and curvaceous silhouette is an homage to the tailleur Bar, a suit from Dior’s 1947 debut. Fashion often echoes the mood of the times, subconsciously or otherwise. Yves Saint Laurent designed a collection inspired by the May 1968 Paris riots; by contrast, Dior’s “New Look” was a salve for the wounds of wartime, making people forget the hardships and revel in luxury. For her collection, Chiuri interprets the “New Look” again, in ivory organza with a peplum of pleats above wide chiffon culottes. It’s an ensemble whose inherent lightness and elastic ease of movement feels like a reflection of that juxtaposition of contemporary feminism (the slogan T-shirt) and historical throwback (the Bar jacket) currently on her own back.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/t-magazine/fashion/maria-grazia-chiuri-dior-couture-show.html

We jet off to foreign countries, on dates predetermined by a higher power (yoga instructors, dietitians), to eat raw meals and practice downward dog alongside complete strangers. In an essay on “The End of Relaxation,” the writer Sadie Stein pointed out that trendy wellness retreats appeal, in large part, by offering the ultimate luxury: freedom from having to make any decisions, since the itineraries are decided for you. And in our day to day, we’re more likely than ever to spare ourselves the agony of having to decide where to go or what to do — and just stay in (lest our choices disappoint us). The writer Molly Young explored the phenomenon for T (“Is Staying In the New Going Out?”), offering as explanation that staying in is low-risk, reliable, easier. She writes about going out, on the other hand: “We do it for the possibility of encountering the spectacular. This rarely happens.” Or, it could happen all the time — if you venture out to a magical place where spectacular encounters are the fabric of everyday life, as they are at Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/t-magazine/travel/greyfield-inn-cumberland-island-chasing-spectacular-encounters.html

Julian Gewirtz’s “Unlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China,” published this month by Harvard University Press, looks at some of the ideas and relationships that paved the way for China’s transformation.

It was a surprising — almost provocative — statement from someone whose most seminal prints are considered riotously decorative, even by maximalist standards. But for Frank, pattern held a meditative power that went way beyond the blankness of monochrome (what he viewed as the visual equivalent of a dead end). In vivid contrast, Frank’s fruitful collaboration with the Swedish interiors brand Svenskt Tenn featured his electrifying botanical configurations on cabinets, curtains and upholstery in glamorous, but otherwise white-walled, rooms.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/t-magazine/design/josef-frank-textiles-patterns-prints.html

2017-01-27,‘Independently Blue’,"Julien Poirier’s work shares qualities of the New York School — casual and anarchic wit, love of high and low culture and willingness to be sentimental — but also a California surrealism. It makes sense, then, that Poirier’s recent book, “Out of Print,” is published by City Lights, the venerable San Francisco publishing house and bookstore founded in 1953. City Lights published Frank O’Hara, along with Allen Ginsberg and many others who first fused some of the same styles that Poirier continues to explore. Here, Poirier’s short poem somehow manages to capture a national mood, or at least some part of it: Bemused disgust pervades, but there remains a bit of room, perhaps, for optimism.

He was at a Trump rally in November, reporting from the press pen, when an “uncomfortable suspicion” took hold of him. “I became convinced we weren’t at these rallies to observe,” he wrote in a dispatch. “We were there to be observed.” Reporters had been following Trump all year. Early rallies had been covered as curiosities; later ones as political mass spectacles. But on the eve of the election, it was clear that a perilous dynamic had been ignored. “He never once failed to invite his crowds to heckle us,” he wrote. “He was placing us on display like captured animals.

He had a bone-marrow transplant, but when the cancer resurfaced a few months later, his parents made the agonizing decision not to pursue further treatment. His health declined, and by July 2015, he had stopped eating and spent his time sleeping or whimpering in pain in his mother’s arms; the hospice team told the family he would die soon. But he began to get better, and that September he celebrated his second birthday — a milestone that had seemed impossible. Blood work revealed that the cancer had disappeared. Cancer specialists speculated about the remarkable case: How Andrew’s own immune system — in the absence of any new treatment — had been able to destroy the cancer cells.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/magazine/childhood-cancer-the-temporary-miracle.html

Instead of painting a view of nature, sculptors created their own massive works outdoors on mesas, moraines and even the floor of the Mojave Desert. In 1971, Mr. Heizer told me: “You can’t really find a harsher climate than where a majority of my work exists right now.

2017-01-27,Behind the Best Sellers: A ‘Sermon’ Debuts and Karen Marie Moning’s ‘Fever’ Series Comes to an End,"Griot Playlist: Michael Eric Dyson’s “Tears We Cannot Stop” — possibly the first book to bear promotional blurbs from both Toni Morrison and Stephen King — makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Subtitled “A Sermon to White America,” the book is a stark polemic about race relations, including discussions of police shootings, affirmative action and black-on-black crime (which Dyson sees as a consequence of mere proximity, what he calls “the geography of despair”). But in keeping with an author who has previously written about Bill Cosby and the rapper Nas, among other subjects — and who contributed a list of “blue-eyed soul stars” to his recent interview with The New York Times Magazine — Dyson also makes room for extensive references to pop culture. The book is dedicated to the Knowles women (Beyoncé, Solange and Tina Knowles-Lawson) and includes an early chapter called “Hymns of Praise” in which Dyson singles out a number of politically conscious black musicians as “our griots.” It’s a smart move, since pop music has often provided a channel for white audiences to learn more about black culture. So what artists does Dyson recommend? N.W.A, KRS-One, the Fugees (and their lead singer, Lauryn Hill), Tupac Shakur, Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar and — of course — the “genius and greatest living entertainer,” Beyoncé herself. Of their songs, Dyson writes: “These and a thousand others are the hymns that answer the reign of terror that consumes our days. These are the hymns that rally us against the fantasy of our erasure. May these hymns be sung loud until our slaughter ceases and our blood no longer spills.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

2017-01-30,Arte Povera Is Back,"Arte Povera, the politicized avant-garde art movement that blossomed in Italy in the late ’60s, is having a moment. Key works from the period make up the core of the collection of Magazzino, an Italian-centric art space opening in the Hudson Valley later this year; and over in Rome, two shows are celebrating the work of one of its leading practitioners, Giuseppe Penone. The Piedmont-born artist currently has a solo show at Gagosian, and his work also fills the first floor of the Fendi headquarters at Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Originally commissioned by Mussolini, the building’s grandiose architecture stands in stark contrast to Penone’s work, which deals primarily with nature and the elements. The centerpiece of the mini-retrospective will be a new work called “Matrice,” a nearly-100-foot-long cross-sectioned fir tree partially cast in bronze. “It exposes time and the way in which nature imbues necessity into chance,” Penone says. This marks the first foray into exhibiting contemporary art for Fendi, whose C.E.O., Pietro Beccari, adheres to one programming condition: “Everything should be about Italian genius and excellence.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/t-magazine/art/arte-povera-fendi-show.html

To answer: Yes, back in 2000, from a food truck outside the Peking Opera School, which we were visiting in Beijing. They were delicious. I had forgotten about jianbing until very recently, as a few people in New York have started making them. Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong. He decided a few years ago to do something, he said, “that would be interesting and make people happy.” He’d like to do his part to make jianbing as mainstream as ramen. At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork. The stand also sells smashed cucumber salad, steamed dumplings and, soon, an egg, cheese and ham breakfast “bing” and sweet dessert versions. Mr. Goldberg has also taken on a couple of partners and has plans for expansions, including a brick-and-mortar shop opening in March next to his commissary in Chelsea: Mr Bing, UrbanSpace Vanderbilt, 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, mr-bing.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/mr-bing-restaurant-jianbing-news.html
