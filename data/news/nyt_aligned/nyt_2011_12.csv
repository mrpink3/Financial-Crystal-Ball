She does this four days a week in the 50-meter pool at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center, in Pasadena, Calif. Her stroke is rhythmic, high in the water. It’s hard to judge how old she is by looking at her. Her back is well muscled. Her legs are girlish — shapely and short. Her skin is as weathered as a crocodile handbag. Her arms are covered with jellyfish scars. When Nyad swims in a pool, she counts in her head, ticking off laps, first in English, then in German, then in Spanish, then in French. (Nyad is fluent in all but German.) The goal is to focus her mind on repetitive thought, as a yogi does with a mantra. But when Nyad swims in the ocean for a long time — 8 or 10 or 12 or even 24 hours — she doesn’t just count, she sings. She’ll do “It Ain’t Me, Babe” 10 times, interspersed with the quatralingual counting, then sing “Paperback Writer,” 10 times, followed by quatralingual counting again. Nyad keeps in her head a playlist of 65 songs. Some are for daytime swimming; others for nighttime. Nyad knows each one intimately, how many seconds each takes, how many strokes. “When I complete 2,000 ‘It Ain’t Me, Babe’s, Bob Dylan version, I know I’ve gone 4 hours and 45 minutes exactly,” Nyad says. “I never lose track.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/magazine/marathon-swimmer-diana-nyad.html

2011-12-01,Yotam Ottolenghi’s International Cuisine,"Yotam Ottolenghi has no trouble embracing complex issues or producing complex, difficult-to-define food. He was born in Jerusalem of European immigrants (his mother is German, his father Italian). His primary business partner, Sami Tamimi — who also grew up in Jerusalem — is Palestinian. Ottolenghi studied philosophy and literature (he has a master’s in comparative literature), and though he attended Le Cordon Bleu for six months, he lacks the bossiness of most chefs. His cooking at his London restaurant, Nopi, and in four gorgeous shops (all called Ottolenghi), is usually thought of and described as broadly Mediterranean, but in fact it’s far more international than that. Not only does he offer out-and-out Asian dishes on the menu; he is also comfortable using soy sauce in what might be thought of as Provençal dishes or hitting tofu with rosemary.

Adele, the British soul singer, received six nominations for her album “21,” which included the hit “Rolling in the Deep.” (Her singing voice has been temporarily silenced by vocal cord surgery, and it is not clear, The Los Angeles Times reported, whether Adele will have recovered sufficiently to perform when the awards are handed out on Feb. 12.) Mr. Mars also received six nominations, three for “Grenade,” his song about unrequited love, and three for the album “Doowops and Hooligans.” Mr. West was nominated seven times based on two albums — his complex solo set “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” and his collaboration with Jay-Z, “Watch the Throne.” Both were left off the Album of the Year list, but were nominated for Rap Album of the Year. (The snub of MBDTF, as Mr. West’s album is known, was certainly the hot topic on Twitter.)",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/breakfast-meeting-dec-1/

Still, the most common illicit activity on the Interwebs —  pornography aside  —  seems to be some form of personal credit card fraud.

Among La Swinton’s revelations: she hates the theater; doesn’t believe in the notion of fixed identity; prefers to think of herself as a “schizophrenic” writer-performer rather than an actor; and used to make a bundle betting on horses. (That’s her Career Plan B.) Ms. Swinton also talked about her work in “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” Lynne Ramsay’s controversial adaptation of Lionel Shriver’s novel about the mother of a son who goes on a Columbine-style rampage. In this clip, Ms. Swinton explains why she believes the film, which recently won the top prize at the London BFI Film Festival, is about more than the familiar facts of that story. “It’s about the inside of someone’s mind,” she said. “If you go into the film expecting that, you are much more likely to have a good trip.”",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/if-this-acting-thing-doesnt-work-out-tilda-swinton-has-a-plan-b/

Mr. Garvin is well known as a big fan of Paris, which Baron Haussmann largely demolished and redesigned for Napoleon III in the 19th century around grand boulevards, streets and pedestrian-friendly spaces.

2011-12-02,Inside the List,"MAN VS. NATURE: Michael Crichton died in 2008, but he hasn’t let a little thing like that keep him from the best-seller list. His first posthumous success was “Pirate Latitudes,” a daffy high-seas adventure discovered among his files, which hit No. 2 on the hardcover fiction list in December 2009. Now Crichton returns with “Micro,” a techno-thriller left mostly unfinished at the time of his death; to complete it, his estate turned to Richard Preston of “The Hot Zone” fame. The novel, at No. 6 in its first week, is vintage high-concept Crichton — a group of science graduate students, hoping to score jobs with a nanotechnology start-up, are instead reduced in size to half an inch and have to battle the microfauna in a Hawaiian rain forest. Think of it as “Honey, I Shrunk Jurassic Park,” with spiders in place of T. rex and wasps in place of raptors. Did Preston have a hard time filling Crichton’s shoes? Not really. He told NPR recently that when he was working with an editor on an earlier book, “at one point she put her hands on her head and said, ‘Oh, Richard, you’re just a 14-year-old boy who likes to gross out the girls.’ I think Michael Crichton had something of that in him too.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2011-12-02,Picture Books About Hanukkah,"I believe in scaring children a little. My daughter has never totally forgiven me for reading to her when she was not yet 3 Maurice Sendak’s “Outside Over There,” with its faceless goblins and their theft of a little girl’s baby sister. I like to think, though, that being haunted by that macabre book led to my daughter’s fanatical devotion to fairy tales, with which she now alarms her dolls. So I was disposed to adore “The Golem’s Latkes,” by Eric A. Kimmel, a Hanukkah story entwined with the legend of the golem, the Jewish Frankenstein. And I like the book fine. But it would be too tame for my daughter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/festival-of-lights.html
2011-12-02,Picture Books About Christmas," What’s with Christmas? So anxious. So self-conscious. Always fretting about its “true spirit.” Always taking its own temperature or rummaging around for “the real meaning of.” Increasingly paranoid about the “war against.” Begging, inevitably, to be saved — December after December after December. Does any other holiday demand magic when a mere day off and a pleasant dinner would suffice? If Christmas were a friend, I’d beg her to go on Zoloft or maybe Thorazine — at least talk to someone, for God’s sake. Or eat some fudge and shut up.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/gifts-of-grace.html

Instrumental in this swift development was a Los Angeles band, the Doors, whose charismatic but tormented and self-­destructive lead singer, Jim Morrison, attained cultlike status after his mysterious death at age 27 in Paris in 1971, only four years after the release of their first album.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-doors-a-lifetime-of-listening-to-five-mean-years-by-greil-marcus-book-review.html
2011-12-02,Judy Collins: Sweet Soprano,"“Gentle voice amid the strife” is how Life magazine described the folk singer Judy Collins on the cover of its May 2, 1969, issue. The label accompanied a photo of a young woman whose distant, blue-eyed gaze hinted at strife of her own. Just months before, Collins had scored a top-10 hit with Joni Mitchell’s pained lament “Both Sides Now.” The record broke through in an age of Vietnam protesters and social revolutionaries, out to save the world but often floundering personally; of young Americans caught between the conformity of their parents’ generation and the pressure to rebel. Collins spoke to the lost soul in all of them when she sang, in Mitchell’s words, “I really don’t know life at all.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/sweet-judy-blue-eyes-my-life-in-music-by-judy-collins-book-review.html

But many A-listers have capitalized on his talents and quite a few valued his friendship. And as this eventful and engaging autobiography emphasizes, that was how he and Edwards planned it. Chic cultivated anonymity.

When the first issue of Life appeared on Nov. 23, 1936, the 200,000 newsstand copies sold out within 24 hours, leaving disappointed customers and vendors clamoring for more.

That makes for a bad fit between this scientific enterprise and the world of public opinion, policy and politics.

McPhee and Nadine M. Orenstein, suggests. “Scholars still puzzle over the function of these drawings, which appear to have had a comic intent,” Orenstein deadpans in her commentary on an etching of a pair of grotesque heads copied from Leonardo.

CARNEGIE HALL TREASURES (Harper Design/HarperCollins, $75), by Tim Page and the Carnegie Hall staff, is a sort of glorified publicity kit — the kind of thing you might give donors as a souvenir or sell to members of the public who wish they had been there. Do not look for complexity, skepticism or critical analysis, much less sober institutional history.

He was loud, audacious, obnoxious, perspicacious, brilliant, narcissistic, provocative and haughty.

2011-12-02,The Magic of Magnum,"It’s not often that a lavish coffee-table book comes trailing equally lavish doubts about the wisdom of its existence. “It’s generally rather depressing to look at my contacts,” Elliott Erwitt tells Kristen Lubben, the editor of MAGNUM CONTACT SHEETS (Thames & Hudson, $150), a magnificent compendium of raw images from the photography cooperative. “One always has great expectations, and they’re not always fulfilled.” Henri Cartier-­Bresson, a Magnum founder, so hated the idea of someone pawing through his outtakes that he once bragged about throwing out his negatives “in the same way as one cuts one’s nails.” Contact sheets “are mostly a waste of money,” the photographer Leonard Freed once declared, though he added: “Because it is a waste of money, I love them.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-magic-of-magnum.html
2011-12-02,Looking Back in Vogue,"The fashion world is, with apologies to William Butler Yeats, no country for old men — or for anything old, really. It traffics in the new because it has to: if styles never changed, Barneys and Bergdorf would have nothing to sell us. But its ­single-minded celebration of the “now” (the latest look, the fresh new face, the next big thing) also betrays a philosophical bias against the “then.” Perhaps nowhere has this bias been more memorably expressed than in a quip often attributed to Karl Lagerfeld, whose career with Chanel has consisted precisely in reinventing and refreshing an aesthetic the company’s founder developed almost a century ago: “The worst is when friends say, ‘Remember the good old days?’ Forget about the good old days! . . . What is interesting is now.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/looking-back-in-vogue.html

Amber! Over here! — in the parking lots of Whole Foods. And now that anyone can snap a “gotcha” picture with his smartphone, what possible status remains in being a professional celebrity chaser?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-golden-age-of-the-paparazzi.html

Subtitled “A Survivor’s Tale,” “Maus” recreated the horrors of the Holocaust — as experienced by Art’s father, Vladek, and mother, Anja — casting Jews as mice and Germans as cats. But it also explored the difficult relationship between tetchy skinflint Vladek and his resentful son with touching and discomfiting honesty.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-making-of-maus.html

2011-12-02,"Diane Keaton: Soulful, Unselfish Maturity","Diane Keaton is admired for her ease in performing the difficult and for making the sensible glamorous. She minted a wildly original style of dressing while moviegoers were just learning her name. For three and a half decades, she’s starred in films spanning from younger woman’s nightmare (“Looking for Mr. Goodbar”) to older woman’s fantasy (“Something’s Gotta Give”), while somehow not being punished for the fact that no role ever quite equaled the luster of her Best Actress-winning turn in “Annie Hall.” She sashayed into arty endeavor — working on books about architecture and photography, directing a documentary on concepts of heaven — without waxing aloof. She rode out the “age thing” (she’s 65) that all female stars face, with minimum humiliation. And she’s been self-sufficient. She forthrightly says, “I never found a home in the arms of a man.” Yet she’s furnished an awfully big home in these pages.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/then-again-by-diane-keaton-book-review.html

2011-12-02,How We Got to Dessert,"Eel in marzipan and goose-liver macaroons may sound like outtakes from Monty Python’s “Crunchy Frog” skit, but in SWEET INVENTION: A History of Dessert (Chicago Review Press, $24.95), Michael Krondl tells us that the eel was offered at a 16th-century Italian banquet while the cookies, known more elegantly as foie gras macaroons, are the creation of a 21st-century Parisian pastry chef. These two dishes show how the relationship between sweet and savory has come full circle — from medieval and Renaissance Europe, when there was no division between them, to their segregation during the 20th century and back again to the current era, in which cutting-edge chefs delight in toying with our expectations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/how-we-got-to-dessert.html

I’ve thought about asking my wife’s parents to abuse me, but it seems too little, too late. I did have a stepfather who bowled.” And: “I’ve had to endure enormous prejudice.

2011-12-02,Pinocchio’s Tribe,"No one better illustrates the evolution of academic literary criticism into poetry than Kenneth Gross. An admired Shakespeare scholar (as well as the author of a kind of precursor to this new book called “The Dream of the Moving Statue”), he moves in “Puppet” way out there beyond mere scholarship. There are myriad internal references (“as Susan Stewart suggests”), back-of-the-book footnotes and a generous bibliography, yet Gross rises serenely above his apparatus, shaping his own vision. He dreams and muses, offering endless insights into the strange and archaic world of puppets, inanimate things breathed to life. This is a book of literary mysticism, rich with accrued culture yet never weighed down by it. It’s a summation of what Gross calls the “vast literature” about puppets, yet never didactic or preachy. It makes arguments and tells stories about wildly diverse puppet traditions, but it can also be dipped into like a book of poetry, savored for its lapidary insights on every page.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/puppet-an-essay-on-uncanny-life-by-kenneth-gross-book-review.html
2011-12-02,Revisiting Camelot," Peter Ackroyd’s vigorous retelling of the Arthur legends, based on Thomas Malory’s 15th-century classic “Le Morte d’Arthur,” begins with a reptilian king, “a dragon in wrath as well as in power,” lasciviously whispering in the ear of another man’s wife. “This dragon will not bite,” he assures her, but she’s grossed out anyway — who wouldn’t be? — and complains to her husband. Kings tend to get what they wish for, especially if Merlin is available to make the magic happen. The husband is killed off, and three hours later the dragon, assuming the dead man’s shape, sleeps with the oblivious woman. Presto, Arthur is conceived, not quite a bastard, as Merlin explains, on a technicality clear only to him. The price for Merlin’s matchmaking is baby Arthur, whom Merlin entrusts to a rustic knight. Only when Arthur, in search of a sword for his foster brother, Sir Kay, conveniently finds one stuck in a stone, is his special destiny disclosed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-death-of-king-arthur-thomas-malorys-le-morte-darthur-retold-by-peter-ackroyd-book-review.html

Kevin Brooks’s “iBoy,” his latest gritty sci-fi thriller (“Black Rabbit Summer,” “The Road of the Dead”), is a vengeance tale that even offers a philosophical take on the criminal actions of these young offenders, a prescient view currently shared by many British politicians: “The application in my iBrain doesn’t care why they do it. It doesn’t care if they’re poor or uneducated or bored or addicted or troubled or lonely or if they simply don’t know any better.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/iboy-by-kevin-brooks-book-review.html

2011-12-02,The Archaeologist as Titan," His introduction to the wonders of the ancient world could hardly have been less auspicious. While in Cairo in the summer of 1815, awaiting an audience with Mohammed Ali Pasha, Turkish viceroy of Egypt, the Italian monk-turned-peddler-turned-hydrologist-turned-circus impresario Giovanni Belzoni paid a visit to the Great Pyramid and became so tightly wedged in one of its internal passages that his guides had to forcibly extract him. It was merely the first of many indignities endured by this 6-foot-6 “giant,” whose adventures in the Nile Valley would yield some of the most imposing treasures in the British Museum.

The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the main facilities at the site were compromised by the quake before the tsunami waves hit. The company has been eager to show that the site was relatively unscathed by the quake. A finding that the quake had caused the damage would heighten concerns about nuclear plants in other areas, where big quakes are far more frequent than tsunamis. A panel of experts that reviewed the study for the company said it had been unprepared for a tsunami of that scale, which slowed its response and made the disaster worse.

The soap opera “General Hospital” and talk shows like “The View” will be incorporated into Times Square Studios, a division of the ABC/Disney Television Group that will manage and create daytime and syndicated shows. Ms. Dummer’s title will be executive vice president of Times Square Studios. “General Hospital,” which has an uncertain fate as ABC’s remaining soap opera, looks like the odd one out at Times Square Studios: a news release on Friday said the division would mostly develop “nonscripted lifestyle and health” programming. Along with “The View,” it will manage the two shows that are replacing the soap operas — “The Chew” and “The Revolution” — as well as the game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” and Katie Couric’s forthcoming syndicated talk show. “The Chew,” which features a panel of five chefs and foodies who cook and drink and chat, began in September in place of “All My Children”; “The Revolution,” described by ABC as a talk show “about health and lifestyle transformations,” is to begin in January in place of “One Life to Live.” Mr. Frons has headed the daytime hours of ABC since 2002. “While my decision to try something new was not arrived at easily, nine years is a long time in television terms,” he said in a statement.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/arts/television/abc-daytime-chief-to-leave-network.html

2011-12-07,"Save a Tree, Eat a Panettone","Panettone, the yeasty, lightly sweetened mound with a smattering of dried fruits, usually has a shelf life surpassed only by that of fruitcake. But here is a panettone that will be reduced to crumbs in a short time. Scarpato, a pastry company founded in Legnano, Italy, in 1888, is baking a not-so-traditional Christmas version, using organic olive oil in the dough. The result — moist, rich and aromatic — is excellent plain with a glass of sweet wine after dinner, or turned into French toast for breakfast. The olive oil comes from a company called Nudo, which supports a collection of small growers in Central Italy, and encourages the public to “adopt” an olive tree to help the farmers — in return for tins of oil.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/dining/panettone-made-with-nudo-olive-oil.html

And though this crystalline new spirit does not begin life in Kings County, it achieves its clean aroma, bright flavor and smooth finish there. It’s the work of a troika of resident Brooklyn vodka lovers: Gary Shokin, who came to New York from Lithuania some 30 years ago; his daughter Kary Laskin, born and raised in Brooklyn; and Mark Krupkin, originally from Latvia. The vodka starts in Missouri, where it is distilled from corn mixed with organic upstate New York wheat. The overproof distillate is shipped to Brooklyn Republic’s Clinton Hill plant, where it is brought down to 80 proof with filtered Brooklyn tap water, then filtered several more times before being sealed in handsome bottles.

2011-12-07,Virginia: Man Jailed for 27 Years Is Exonerated,"The Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday exonerated a man convicted in a series of sexual assaults in 1984. DNA evidence showed that the man,  Thomas Haynesworth, could not have committed the crimes in which such evidence had been preserved, and it pointed to another man. Gov. Bob McDonnell released Mr. Haynesworth on parole in March, but Mr. Haynesworth petitioned for full exoneration. Prosecutors in the counties where the assaults occurred supported his effort, as did the commonwealth’s attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli. The Court of Appeals initially heard the appeal and then asked for further briefs. Shawn Armbrust, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, said, “After serving nearly 27 years for crimes that he didn’t commit, Mr. Haynesworth has had to register as a sex offender and abide by degrading conditions while the Court of Appeals took nearly nine months to conclude that the attorney general and the prosecutors were right that Mr. Haynesworth didn’t commit these crimes.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/us/virginia-thomas-haynesworth-exonerated-after-27-years-in-jail.html

The higher price will help it pay for the extra staff needed to shepherd museumgoers through Mr. Höller’s carnival-like pieces, which take up all the museum’s floors: goggles that turn the world upside down; a three-story tubular slide; and a heavily salinated sensory deprivation tank (complete with a shower and hooks for the clothes of those who decide to undress and get in for a float).",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/crowds-at-holler-exhibition-force-price-hike/

2011-12-07,First Look | Valentino’s Timestrings Collection,"At first glance it’s hard to find a common thread running through Valentino’s spring capsule collection, Timestrings. The studded peep-toe booties, satin flats, polka-dot platforms and bow-embellished kitten heels carry many of the brand’s signatures, but share none of them collectively. What all of the shoes do share is a handwritten time stamp — a numerical record of the amount of time it took to make each pair. For example, the sequence etched into a pair of silver chain wedge heels is 47.41’50”, denoting 47 hours, 41 minutes and 50 seconds. “When we talk about luxury and time, it’s clear that there’s a strong connection between the two,” says Maria Grazia Chiuri, one of the house’s two co-designers. “Time is the new luxury, and luxury does not exist without time and the consciousness of a unique tradition.” Classic Italian craftsmanship still exists (Valentino is known for its old Florentine factories), but in an age of fast everything it’s easy to forget our Old World cobblers: the one devoted to flowers, the one who specializes in crystals and another with expertise in lace, for example. Pierpaolo Piccioli, Chiuri’s design partner, adds, “It’s nice to know that you’re buying a kind of cultural process.” Milled plexiglass and velvet wedges marked 38H? At $1,295, that’s $34 an hour, if you break it down. And yes, it’s worth it.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/first-look-valentinos-timestrings-collection/

2011-12-07,Underworld to Create Music for Opening of 2012 Olympics in London,"The members of the electronic dance music group Underworld have been named the musical directors for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London, organizers announced on Wednesday. The duo, Rick Smith and Karl Hyde, will work alongside the artistic director, the British filmmaker Danny Boyle, to produce the music for the three-hour performance on July 27. It is not the first time Mr. Boyle has chosen Mr. Smith and Mr. Hyde to provide the soundtrack for one of his projects. The group is perhaps best known for its dance track “Born Slippy,” which first appeared in a scene from Mr. Boyle’s 1996 film “Trainspotting.” Since then, they have created music for four other projects by Mr. Boyle, including a National Theater production of “Frankenstein” that received high praise from critics. Mr. Boyle said the hiring of Underworld to write music for the Games was “the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle” and praised the duo’s creative range. Mr. Hyde said the chance to compose for the Olympics was a great honor. “We want to leave people with a musical memory of the show rather than a purely visual one,” he said in a statement.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-music-for-opening-of-2012-olympics-in-london/

2011-12-07,21st-Century Frocks | Azzedine Alaïa at the Groninger Museum,"Azzedine Alaïa has never obeyed the fashion calendar and shows only when he — and his clothes — are good and ready. In fact, in recent years, the designer, who is now in his 70s, has probably had as many runway presentations as museum exhibitions, including the one that opens this weekend at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands. “Azzedine Alaïa in the 21st Century” focuses solely on his output from roughly the past decade, and yet there is more substance there than many designers could ever hope to achieve in a lifetime, including the fierce tailcoat above and a toothsome evening dress with a zipper that spirals suggestively around the body from the neck to the floor. Always the perfectionist in the pursuit of beauty (he’s often referred to as a “sculptor of women’s bodies”), Alaïa apparently recut or totally remade many of the pieces in the show to the exact proportions of the mannequins. In an open love letter to the designer, Mark Wilson, who curated the exhibition, writes, “I’m sure that certain people may wonder why we are doing this one more time?” referring to a massive Alaïa exhibition at the Groninger Museum back in in 1997-98. Wilson promptly answers his own question: “Because you are the last great couturier working today.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/21st-century-frocks-azzedine-alaia-at-the-groninger-museum/

Granted, there are other period-instrument “Messiah” readings in town, most notably those offered by Trinity Church. (This year’s run begins on Sunday and includes a performance at Alice Tully Hall on Dec. 19.) But where St. Thomas has the edge is in its use of a chorus of men and boys, the younger singers drawn from its own choir school, a British tradition that stretches back beyond the time when Handel worked in England. Not that the superb, fully professional Trinity Choir has any reason to feel second best. But there is a purity in the sound of trained boy sopranos that a mixed adult choir cannot match.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/arts/music/john-scott-leads-messiah-at-st-thomas-church-review.html

It typically involves a coterie of the world’s hottest models jetting to an exquisitely remote clime — the Seychelles, say, or Botswana — to be photographed, nude, by an elite fashion photographer. The calendar began inauspiciously as a pinup that grease monkeys would post at continental service stations. But just like in the case of Michelin’s influential guidebook, it took on a life of its own and now its connection to motoring seems completely incidental. (One must give props to all these European tire makers for their enduring contributions to world culture; the best thing our own Goodyear has come up with so far is a blimp.)",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/now-exposing-the-2012-pirelli-calendar/

2011-12-08,China: Hundreds Arrested on Child-Selling Charges," More than 600 people across China have been arrested on suspicion of selling children, according to a statement released Wednesday by the Ministry of Public Security. The statement also said 178 children had been freed. There has been greater scrutiny of trafficking in children this year, in part because of news reports by Caixin Century Weekly that shed light on child abductions and child-selling in Hunan Province. Some children were later adopted by foreigners, Caixin reported. Experts say the kidnapping and sale of children is a problem in China because of the country’s one-child policy and the cultural preference among many parents for boys. Families in many areas are fined heavily if they have more than one child and refuse to give up the others, and some officials have abducted children from such families. In addition, some parents are willing to sell girls so they can keep or try to conceive a son as their only child.

The new definition approved by the advisory board, which met in Albuquerque on Tuesday, includes the rape of men and crimes that involve oral or anal penetration or penetration with objects. The definition must be approved by the F.B.I.’s director, Robert S. Mueller III, before it is adopted. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/us/fbi-board-votes-to-broaden-definition-of-rape.html

2011-12-12,"A Vision of Dance, Preserved in 3-D","“PINA” is a dance movie like no other. This documentary, by Wim Wenders, focuses on the German choreographer Pina Bausch and her company Tanztheater Wuppertal, but in a disarming twist it uses 3-D technology to take audiences inside the artist’s universe. It’s an immersive experience that at moments makes viewers feel as if they were dancing too. The film, one of 15 on the shortlist for the best documentary feature Oscar, was in the works when Bausch died unexpectedly at 68 in 2009. So Mr. Wenders, director of “Buena Vista Social Club” and “Wings of Desire,” decided to cancel it. Only after her dancers pressed him did he decide to finish the movie, which features excerpts from four major pieces and scenes of the performers in and around Wuppertal, Germany — on hilltops, in coal mines, in monorails and on medians — bringing to life a dreamscape only Bausch and Mr. Wenders could have conjured. Julie Bloom spoke with Mr. Wenders in New York about the film, which opens on Dec. 23.

2011-12-12,"William F. Buckley Jr.: Right Man, Right Time","William F. Buckley Jr. was an immodest man with much to be immodest about. Not only was he the high priest of the modern American conservative movement and the founding editor in chief of its leading intellectual publication, National Review; he was also a gifted polemicist, best-selling novelist, sesquipedalian speaker, television star, political candidate, yachtsman, harpsichordist, wit and bon vivant. Small wonder that I once saw him nod approvingly when a tongue-tied freshman referred to his 1951 autobiographical best seller as “God as Man at Yale.” He performed his many roles with such panache, and such obvious enjoyment of being William F. Buckley Jr., that he captivated people who otherwise would have despised someone who did much to move the United States politically to the right from the early 1950s until his death in 2008. But even liberals had to laugh when Buckley, asked whether he slouched in his chair as host of the TV program “Firing Line” because he couldn’t think on his feet, drawled, “It is hard . . . to stand up . . . under the weight . . . of all that I know.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/buckley-william-f-buckley-jr-and-the-rise-of-american-conservatism-by-carl-t-bogus-book-review.html

This is rarely the case in Indian novels, where mangoes tend to be luminescent orbs dangling in steamy air, glistening with sweetness, sex and Being itself, waiting to be plucked, caressed, birthed. Either that or they’re muddy and rotten and piled high on a dirty road, surrounded by rancid garbage, rank cooking fires, beggar children and grinning, greasy swindlers. In other words, mangoes in India’s literary fiction are much like India in literary fiction: distinguished by pleasing aromas or permanent anarchy, if not some chutneyed combination.

Then again, that verbal image applies well to Alexander Popper, known to all simply as Popper, the melancholy, searching main character of Peter Orner’s third work of fiction. With its short and evocative chapters, its charged and playful language, its movement to and fro in time, the novel is indeed poetic. It’s epic too, encompassing Popper’s life from childhood into his early 30s as well as chunks of the life spans of his parents and two of his grandparents, with check-ins on various other relatives.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/love-and-shame-and-love-by-peter-orner-book-review.html
2011-12-12,The Deputy Sheriff as Misfit,"New Mexico is a place of great beauty and great melancholy, and, like all of the American West, a magnet for misfits. Willa Cather captured these aspects in her classic 1927 novel “Death Comes for the Archbishop.” Now Percival Everett, author of genre-bending novels like “I Am Not Sidney Poitier” and “Glyph,” vividly evokes the same elements in “Assumption,” his new trilogy of interwoven murder mysteries. Investigating all three cases is the enigmatic Ogden Walker, deputy sheriff in Plata, a fictional county in the northern part of the state, physically not far from the health farms and art galleries of trendy Taos, but in all other respects a world away. Plata is the opposite of trendy. It’s a blink-and-you-missed-it burg of shabby adobe dwellings and aging pickup trucks and trailers like the one Ogden lives in.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/assumption-by-percival-everett-book-review.html

2011-12-12,The Rediscovery of Luis de Góngora,"“But what is this poem about?” This dread question stalks almost every poetry classroom, and it’s vanquished only to return with a tenacity that would intimidate Michael Myers. Most recently, Ernie Lepore, a professor at Rutgers, took a swing at it in The New York Times’s philosophy blog, The Stone. Lepore is interested in what’s sometimes called “the heresy of paraphrase” — the idea that what a poem is really about is best represented by the poem itself. He concludes that while the usual reasoning behind the heresy claim is suspect, the idea itself is basically right. Poetry, Lepore argues, is not just about its paraphrasable data (and what we might make of that data), but also about the way that data is articulated. So Frost’s “Mending Wall” is about a not-so-bright farmer, a bunch of rocks and their various symbolic accouterments; yet it’s also about the break between the word “balance” in Line 18 and “Stay” in Line 19.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/the-solitudes-by-luis-de-gongora-book-review.html

At times, he could barely walk, ulcers having chewed through the “muscle, tendon and bone” of his feet. Riddled with malaria, plagued with piles and weakened by pneumonia, he had pulled out several of his rotting teeth using strong thread and a heavy pistol. He had been attacked by roasting heat, pouring rain, tick fever, hostile slavers and leeches “as close as smallpox.” By 1873, he had an excruciatingly painful blood clot in his intestine the size of a fist. In this extremity of suffering, he found time to appreciate the “sweet” voice of a tree frog, but it is another entry in his diary — of truly towering understatement — that most perfectly sums up the wry fortitude of men like Livingstone: “It is not all pleasure this exploration.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/books/review/explorers-of-the-nile-the-triumph-and-tragedy-of-a-great-victorian-adventure-by-tim-jeal-book-review.html

Like so many painful family stories, this one begins with a miscommunication. The novel opens in 1927. Two sisters live in the hardscrabble town of Juniper, Ky. Bertie, about to receive her eighth-grade diploma, dreams of marrying her beau, Wallace, “just maybe, in another year.” Meanwhile her older sister, Mabel, secretively plans to leave home and escape their monstrous stepfather. Alas, things go wrong — disastrously and not quite plausibly. The stepfather is found dead. Mabel and Wallace vanish. Bertie assumes she has been betrayed.

China has five-year plans. We have 100 days every four.

It’s not that Egyptians seek a harsh Islamic regime; rather they think the Islamic candidates have a better record working in their neighborhoods and may be a little less likely to take bribes than other candidates. Plenty of the hand-wringing seems to be coming from Americans who’ve never actually met a Muslim Brotherhood member or a Salafi, and I’d suggest not overdoing the rhetoric.

2011-12-12,Rumor Fever,"HONG KONG — China hosts some 300 million microblog accounts (including my own), and officials say that domestic social media put out more than 200 million posts every day. In hopes of getting a handle on this potentially threatening surge of information, the government has started a campaign that aims to quash what it calls “rumors” — statements that it says threaten the public order but that it has not bothered to define. After a series of public opinion disasters this past year, the Communist Party has been pressuring social media providers to weed out allegations it finds threatening, and state media have tried to whip up fear over their malignant social effects.The party’s fever over rumors began in August, following the July 23 high-speed rail collision in Wenzhou. The government took a public opinion beating over the crash, in large part because social media harnessed anger over the bungled rescue effort, the safety of the high-speed rail network and corruption in the Railways Ministry. Once party leaders wrested back control of the story, they pushed all relevant facts into the darkness, leaving only rumors to sate the public’s appetite for the truth. And this summer two other embarrassing public opinion defeats for China’s leadership originally took off on the Internet: the Guo Meimei affair, which exposed irregularities at the government-run Red Cross Society of China, and the massive and well-organized public demonstrations against a chemical project in Dalian.",Opinion,https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/rumor-fever/

Dothraki was created by David J. Peterson, a 30-year-old “conlanger,” a person who constructs new languages. (Of course, even “real” languages are products of invention – for example, my dictionary doesn’t have the world “conlanger.”) The lengths the producers have gone to have a consistent language, Amy Chozick writes, represents Hollywood’s growing need “to infuse fantasy and science-fiction movies, television series and video games with a sense of believability.” It was true for “Avatar,” which included a robust language, Na’vi, that was spoken by the giant blue inhabitants of Pandora.

Palestinians object to Israel’s carrying out any work at the site in Jerusalem’s Old City on grounds that it is in occupied territory, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war. Any change in the status quo there has the potential to set off unrest. The bridge, known as the Mugrabi ramp, was erected as a temporary measure in 2004 after an older ramp collapsed.

In the course of the semester my students have learned how to read religion clause cases against the background of long-standing debates in philosophy and theology about the relationship between religious imperatives and the obligations of democratic citizenship. They have become adept at recognizing the arguments behind the arguments the justices are making explicitly. They can see how a case ostensibly about vouchers or school prayer or Christmas trees on courthouse steps is really about whether principle or history should inform a court’s decisions. They can see how a case about head coverings or beards in the military (a topic that has surfaced once again) turns on the distinctions set down in John Locke’s “Letter Concerning Toleration” (1689), a tract the justices may never have read. They can see how the majority and dissenting opinions in a free exercise case often reflect a tension between negative and positive liberty as these terms are defined by Isaiah Berlin, an author the justices will likely not have referenced. They can see how the entire history of religion-clause jurisprudence at once illustrates and is an extended critique of John Rawls’s attempt in “Political Liberalism” to devise a form of government that will be fair to religion while at the same time keeping it at arm’s length.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/teaching-law/

2011-12-13,The Trouble With Debates (II),"O.K., I take it back. No sooner did I write a post suggesting that future primaries would benefit from more intimate debates — featuring smaller group of candidates rather than the whole field, longer answers rather than short ones, and so on — than yesterday’s Jon Huntsman-Newt Gingrich “Lincoln-Douglas” debate went and demonstrated why that could turn out to be an absolutely terrible idea. Trip Gabriel’s writeup for the Times does a good job of capturing the droning deadliness of the affair, the painful seminar-room quality, the absence any spark in the candidates’s answers to the exquisitely-polite questions. (“After an hour and a half, when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined, the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief.”) If Gingrich made good on his pledge to teach an online class while in the Oval Office, I imagine that it would turn out something like this. And if Huntsman’s supporters want to know why their man has struggled to inspire any excitement or strong support, despite an impressive record and solid conservative bona fides, the answer begins with the fact that he just spent 90 minutes on a stage with the candidate leading in the polls and never once said anything that might actually make some real news for his own struggling campaign. (And yes, I understand that it was all about tag-teaming Romney. But that’s no excuse for being lights-out boring.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/the-trouble-with-debates-ii/

2011-12-13,Out There | Neïl Beloufa’s Brave New World,"Like many artists responding to our duplicitous marketing- and infotainment-driven world, Neïl Beloufa, a young French Algerian video artist based in Paris, works in the interstices of fact and fiction. In “Kempinski (2007),” which was on view last year at the New Museum, Beloufa uses a simple tweak in tense to build an eerie alternate reality. Shot at night in Mali, “Kempinski” features interviews with local inhabitants in rural settings — in a crowd of oxen, in bushes, in dusty courtyards — who speak about things from telepathic communication with stars, animals and machines to teleportation via light and sound, as if they were present-day realities. The scenes are lit by handheld, corded fluorescent lights that could, if you squint, be mistaken for alien technology, and the subjects’ assertions register as farcical deadpan: Beloufa’s tone of choice. The narration plays on a viewer’s superficial ideas of where primitive magic and futuristic science might meet, hinging on that rhetorical switch from “will be” to “is.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/out-there-neil-beloufas-brave-new-world/

She and the three students accused of hazing her are also graduates of DeKalb schools.

And while plays like “Jerusalem,” “The _______ With the Hat” and “Other Desert Cities” are anything but experimental in form, each seduces its audiences into traveling into places that they hadn’t expected (or thought they wanted) to visit. With one notable exception (the Belarus Free Theater’s galvanizing “Being Harold Pinter”) the shows listed below have the pleasingly familiar surface appearance of the Broadway of decades ago.

2011-12-16,"A Bracing Wind, Propelling a Dynamic Comeback","There were heavy gales blowing from the stage at the Jazz Standard late Tuesday night: fast, roiling, tenacious. They embodied the focused effort of the tenor and soprano saxophonist Azar Lawrence, leading an assembled quintet. But “effort” didn’t feel like the impression Mr. Lawrence was trying to foster.

2011-12-16,What if You Could Meet Yourself as an Adult? These Children Do,"Since “The Nutcracker” in all its many versions is always a tale of transformation, there’s a well-established tradition of making its little heroine grow up to become the adult heroine who dances the Sugar Plum pas de deux. Usually, though, this involves a grown-up dancer playing the little girl in the party of the first scene, which means that, right at the start, we have to suspend disbelief. The central marvel of Alexei Ratmansky’s “Nutcracker” — new last year and returning now to American Ballet Theater repertory at the Brooklyn Academy of Music — lies in its vision of adults as the transformed potential future of the children who carry the story.

He nodded to the conductor, and the stuffy air in the hall suddenly began pulsing and throbbing, banging and wailing with a loud and persistent mechanical cacophony. Within a few minutes, according to one eyewitness, the concert had degenerated into a shouting match: “Above the mighty noise of the pianos and drums arose catcalls and booing, shrieking and whistling, shouts of ‘thief’ mixed with ‘bravo.’ ” The audience, which included Eliot, Pound, Joyce and Diaghilev, was in an uproar.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/books/review/hedys-folly-by-richard-rhodes-book-review.html

Mr. Scorsese’s complaint is apt, and also kind of funny, since usually when people bemoan the cultural ignorance of the young they mean that the kids aren’t reading great literature or listening to classical music.

The fourth in the franchise, this “Mission” has a solid cast, including a notable new co-star in Jeremy Renner; a new director, Brad Bird; and a story that’s as nonsensical as any in the series.

2011-12-16,Pride and Prejudice and Murder,"Aspiring writers take heart: one of the most beloved novels of all time was rejected when it was fluttered in front of publishers in 1797 — or so the historical record suggests. Called “First Impressions,” it was written by a country girl whose father was so impressed by his daughter’s sage and vivacious creation that he sent a letter of inquiry to a publisher, who refused even to look at the manuscript. Never mind. Sixteen years later, the book appeared under a different title.

2011-12-16,The Voices in Philip K. Dick’s Head,"In 1979, I visited Philip K. Dick for a profile I was writing. In a modest apartment he shared with dusty stacks of books, deteriorating furniture, a vintage stereo system and a couple of cats, he took the opportunity to go public about a singular experience dominating his life. For the past five years, he told me earnestly, he had been receiving messages from a spiritual entity. “It invaded my mind and assumed control of my motor centers,” he said. “It set about healing me physically and my 4-year-old boy, who had an undiagnosed life-threatening birth defect that no one had been aware of. It had memories dating back over 2,000 years. . . . There wasn’t anything that it didn’t seem to know.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/books/review/the-exegesis-of-philip-k-dick-edited-by-pamela-jackson-jonathan-lethem-and-erik-davis-book-review.html

Hitchens, who died on Thursday at the age of 62, was matter of fact about it, as he was about everything having to do with his illness.

Listening to the older songs on your new retrospective, “Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage,” I was unable to stop bouncing my leg. Is it the speed I’m hearing?  That certainly contributed. Peter Buck developed a style of guitar playing that was, at the time, very unpopular, picking rather than playing punk-rock power chords. Mike Mills’s favorite band was the Ramones, and with that you got that hyperanimated 16th note and 32nd note. And with speed and beer you get speed.

Slowly, since the 1960s, Benton Harbor has lost all its factories and half its population; those who remain subsist on a per capita income of $10,000. The city’s finances are so wrecked that the state government sent in an emergency manager who answers to no one locally. Putting a golf course in the midst of all this is, as Jon observes, “almost a caricature of economic disparity.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/this-sunday-how-nice-can-benton-harbor-ever-be/

No executions have been conducted in California since 2006, when a federal judge effectively halted lethal injections, citing various deficiencies in the state’s methods. Since then, the state has revamped its execution system, including the construction of a new death chamber specifically for lethal injections.

2011-12-19,‘Sherlock Holmes’ and ‘Chipmunks’ Are Sluggish Leaders at Box Office,"Bells are ringing in Hollywood, but they’re not the Christmas kind. Two big sequels, “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,” delivered shaky results over the weekend, alarming studios about a continued downturn at the North American box office. “A Game of Shadows” (Warner Brothers) was No. 1 with about $40 million in ticket sales. Analysts had expected that film, which cost $125 million to make, to take in over $50 million; the first installment in this franchise opened with $62 million in 2009. “Chipwrecked” (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $23.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. That result was 52 percent below the opening weekend total for the last Chipmunks movie in 2009. “Chip-Wrecked” cost an estimated $80 million to make. A variety of factors could have dented interest: sequel fatigue, family film overload, higher ticket prices, a lack of overall momentum at the box office. Elsewhere, Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol” (Paramount) was a powerful third, taking in about $13 million in limited release on 425 Imax screens. That result set an Imax record and positioned “Ghost Protocol” as a potential blockbuster and career rebound for Mr. Cruise as it expands nationwide on Wednesday. “New Year’s Eve” (Warner) was fourth with about $7.4 million in ticket sales, lifting its two-week total to $24.8 million. “The Sitter” (Fox) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4.4 million for a two-week total of $17.7 million.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/sherlock-holmes-and-chipmunks-are-sluggish-leaders-at-box-office/

Her career was also influenced by drug addiction, troubled love relationships and health and legal problems. In 2010 she was hospitalized for a staph infection, and it became public that she was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, and that she had been treated for dependence on painkillers.

The rotating cast for the series of performances in honor of Shawn starting on July 11 will include about 20 prominent male dancers, among them Arthur Mitchell of the Dance Theater of Harlem, the tap-dance specialist Jason Samuels Smith and the former New York City Ballet principal Jock Soto. The schedule for the festival, to run from June 16 to Aug. 26, was released on Sunday. Among the other highlights of this year’s festival are a rare United States performance by the Hong Kong Ballet of Kinsun Chan’s “Black on Black”; a world premiere by the Swedish choreographer and dancer Pontus Lidberg, performed by Morphoses; and a collaboration between Jonah Bokaer and David Hallberg. This year Ella Baff, the executive and artistic director of Jacob’s Pillow, decided to break with that institution’s tradition of offering mostly new works. She programmed repeat performances of three popular dances from past festivals: Tero Saarinen’s Shaker-inspired “Borrowed Light” from 2006, Crystal Pite’s “Dark Matters” from last summer and Doug Elkins’s “Fräulein Maria” from 2009. “I hope to encourage the public to consider more contemporary dance works as classics, to be revisited in the same way that we enjoy and deepen our appreciation for classic works of music, theater and the visual arts,” Ms. Baff said in a statement.

2011-12-19,Prague and Pyongyang,"The deaths of Vaclav Havel and Kim Jong Il within a 24-hour span are more than a reminder of the extremes of heroism and iniquity that coexist in human affairs. They’re a reminder of how much successful political heroism depends, in the end, on the ability to prick the conscience of iniquity, and to remind even the worst regimes and most compromised authorities that there are moral absolutes which they transgress at their peril. The great success of the Velvet Revolution, like the successes of Gandhi and Mandela and Martin Luther King and so many other icons of peaceful revolution, was achieved by public argument as well as by public protest, and by the fact that the bureaucrats and apparatchiks and generals the revolutionaries were confronting weren’t willing to take the most absolute and unthinkable steps to retain their privileges and defend their power. (In David Chappell’s “A Stone of Hope,” a history of religion and the civil rights movement, there’s a fascinating account of how this worked in the white South — the way that the Christian appeals of King and Ralph Abernathy and Co. persuaded many white Christians that they had a moral obligation to stand by and let the revolution happen, rather than defend Jim Crow to the end.) When civil disobedience works, it does so by reminding the inhumane of their inhumanity, and by finding the vulnerabilities in what seem like permanently hardened hearts. In this sense, there’s a circular quality to any successful peaceful revolt: No De Klerk without Mandela but also no Mandela (as we know Mandela) without De Klerk; no Gorbachev without Sakharov and Walesa and Havel, but no Havel and Walesa (as we know them) without Gorbachev.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/prague-and-pyongyang/

2011-12-20,Elizabeth Taylor’s Final Legacy,"After the last diamond-encrusted bauble had been snatched up, the last item of Dior couture sold, the last Fendi handbag handed on to a new owner, the sale of Elizabeth Taylor’s vast collections netted $156.8 million. The four days of sales at Christie’s became the most valuable private jewelry sale in history ($137.2 million) and the most valuable private collection of fashion ever sold ($5.5 million). The first online-only Christie’s sale drew 57,000 bids and reaped $9.5 million. The complete collection sold out, a testament to both the star’s magnetism and the quality of the merchandise. All the proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Taylor Trust, which manages the Taylor estate.  Taylor was well-known in her later years for her fund-raising and activism for AIDS research. A portion of the profit generated by Christie’s sale of exhibition tickets (58,000 people saw the exhibit in its international travels), event  sponsorship and the ongoing sales of “select publications,” will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. The auction house also raised $170,00 through the sale of a deluxe limited edition boxed set of the catalogs on the first evening of the auction, which will also go to the foundation.  Some highlights from the later sales: those Vuitton trunks, with the violet-colored tags reading “Mine!” sold for $245,500, the top figure for the accessories sale. The Andy Warhol lithograph signed and dedicated by the artist went for $662,000. A (quite hideous) beaded Versace bolero jacket featuring rhinestone images of Taylor in some of her famous roles fetched $128,500. Even rocks Taylor never actually wore went for big sums: a large gray “scholar’s rock” netted $386,500, more than 30 times its estimate of $8,000 to $12,000. Christie’s will complete the dispersal of the Taylor collections in the new year with sales of her Old Master paintings (Jan. 25 in New York), including a Frans Hals portrait (not of Taylor), and her Impressionist and modern art collection (London, Feb. 7 and 8). Chris Wilding, Taylor’s son and a trustee of the foundation, said, “My mother always acknowledged that she was merely the temporary custodian of the incredible things she owned. Today, I think she would be happy to know that her collections will continue to enrich the lives of those who have acquired pieces.”",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/elizabeth-taylors-final-legacy/

But eventually the original turned up in the hands of a cinematographer who said he had received it from Welles as a gift, and, after a court fight, it was turned over to Welles’s daughter Beatrice. When the original first went on the block, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences went to court to try to stop the sale, but lost. Sotheby’s later tried to sell it, but ended that effort when an undisclosed reserve price was not met. And, now, finally the Oscar has been sold in an auction that, according to Sanders, included an underbid from the magician David Copperfield. “I’m proud to have represented this fantastic award to the cinema collecting community,” Nate D.

2011-12-22,A Seasonal Cocktail: The Bitter Darling,"I was recently asked to create a specialty cocktail for a big holiday bash. I knew I wanted it to be something special and seasonal, but the constraints posed by the party (it was held at the Center for Fiction, a lovely place, but one not equipped with a full bar or full kitchen) demanded that I keep it simple. Not a worry, as I’m inclined to keep it simple where cocktails are concerned. The classic rye Manhattan was my starting point. What if I replaced the sweet vermouth with ginger syrup? That worked fine, but something was missing. I was testing the drink in a friend’s kitchen in New Hampshire over Thanksgiving weekend. A bowlful of clementines (one of my favorite winter treats) sat on the counter. Freshly squeezed clementine juice — and a generous dousing of Angostura bitters — brought the whole thing together. It’s easy to make ginger syrup: I prepare a basic sugar-and-water simple syrup, in which I steep peeled, fresh ginger long enough that its strong, spicy bite really comes through. But you can skip this step altogether and buy the excellent ready-made ginger syrup from Brooklyn’s Morris Kitchen. As a nod to the bitters and the clementine, I christened the drink the Bitter Darling. It was a hit. And even though I invented it especially for one party, I’m sure it’ll be a mainstay of my winter-cocktail repertory.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/a-seasonal-cocktail-the-bitter-darling/

2011-12-22,The Republican Cul-De-Sac,"There are any number of things I’d rather be doing 72 hours before Christmas than writing about the payroll tax debate, but it’s an important window into the continuing policy dysfunction afflicting the Republican Party. The problem, to be clear, doesn’t lie in the particular stance that the House Republicans have taken over the last week, insisting on a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut rather than two-month extension agreed to in the Senate. (On the merits, the House is right to want a full-year extension, the Senate’s punt was an embarrassment, and the compromise that may be in the offing looks like better policy than a purely short-term deal.) Rather, it lies in the fact that we’ve been having drawn-out negotiations about the issue at all. Republicans should have just taken yes for answer, embraced a bipartisan tax cut, declared victory and gone home for Christmas. Instead, a Republican Party that blithely voted to extend the Bush tax cuts without any offsets suddenly became very, very concerned about “paying for” a far more modest measure, and a G.O.P. that’s supposedly committed to the lowest possible middle class tax burden decided that it needed to extract concessions from a Democratic president in exchange for supporting … a middle class tax cut.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/the-republican-cul-de-sac/

But one thing that almost every New York moment has in common is a surprise of some sort. Some surprises are dreadful. An 8-year-old boy named Leiby Kletzky was supposed to walk the seven blocks back to his home in Borough Park one day in July, but he never made it. Other surprises were joyful. Same-sex couples did not go into the year thinking they would have the right to marry before the summer was out.

2011-12-23,Arab Spring,"THE BREATH AND HUM of democracy seemed almost a libidinous thing in parts of the Middle East, but, in truth, the body heat had been simmering for years. The protests took hold in Tunisia in late 2010 after the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire. The kindle caught and the spirit of his self-immolation lit a fuse across the region. A wave of protests struck Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan. Almost as soon as protesters in Cairo were being herded away from Tahrir Square, they were dancing at the news of Mubarak’s resignation. Ruling families began to fall. Power-transfer treaties were brokered. Parliaments were dissolved. Monarchs locked their gates and boarded their windows. In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was ousted and killed. NATO planes streaked a sky so blue it seemed it to speak of other Septembers. Faces, too, were lit by a new blue light. It was the era of the revolution down through the wires: time was collapsed and geography shrunk by the use of social networking. The whole world was indeed watching, listening, e-mailing. Some in the media lost their lives for the art of the images that emerged — the photographs didn’t just capture singular moments, but they looked backward and forward at the same time, at what has happened, and what is yet to come.

2011-12-23,Occupy Wall Street,"“WE ARE THE 99 PERCENT.” It was so much beyond a local slogan: the louder it was spoken, the more it began to say. My job, my streets, my economy, my riot, my skin. Cities shook their souls out. The yearning went global. Some protesters poured gasoline into bottles and lighted the sky with fire. Others unfurled hammocks under light poles. The idea was to be seen, to be heard, to be tweeted. The year 2011 was an evanescent spectacle of anger. Every corner was a world, and every world had its corners. The bankers stood back, the corporations hushed a moment, the politicians held their breath, and the cops took out their pepper spray. It might have begun in Wisconsin, had its adolescence in Greece, and shattered the night in London, but it lost and won its innocence in Zuccotti Park. Suddenly, a tent had as much meaning as a tower. Kids from all over the country boiled collard greens in the courtyard of commerce. The city’s bureaucrats tried frantically to barricade them in, or out — nobody seemed sure which. The anger rolled all the way down to Wall Street and the markets shivered a moment. When cold weather kicked in, the tents began to disappear and the anger diffused, but the images remained, another sort of fire in flight.

The soldiers moved through the sandstorms, and landed back home in the United States to deal with the continuing legacy of American foreign policies. In 2011, Barack Obama’s promises were finally beginning to find their way onto the front pages. A spectacular nighttime raid found Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The helicopters landed. The weight of the past was kicked up in the dust. Author of a decade of killing, Bin Laden had endpages that were quick and sharp. He was shot dead, buried at sea, and the White House held its breath: it sounded so much like a sigh of joy, exhausted and necessary. The soldiers continued their journeys: it was a big world they were returning to. The seven billionth baby was born, starting global discussions on issues of environment, health and technology. Europe teetered on the edge of ruin, stunned by even more economic philandering. In the fall, lights were lit for Kim Il-sung and a regime that has hidden its face. In Norway the island of Utoya heard gunshots among the trees. Parts of Africa were dealing, yet again, with an almost impossible hunger and thirst.

Cars began to float alongside washing machines, computers, people. The incredible could occur. And then the tsunami seemed to wash away the last vain dream of the 20th century: the nuclear answer. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant went into meltdown and watched its poisons filter out to sea, and what remained is what we all must live with: the democratic rage of nature. No matter what we do, we cannot regulate how we are shaped by weather. We look for calm, but there is always an inevitability of storm. The images from Joplin, Mo., were pure with grief. A snowstorm paralyzed Tulsa, Okla. The Souris River shed more than a tear. The streets of Bangkok were almost apocalyptic during floods. There were droughts, earthquakes, wildfires scattering animals like dice. So, the question, then, is ancient: How with such rage shall beauty hold a plea? Rescuers in Turkey put their fingers on part of the pulse when they managed to pull 2-week-old Azra Karaduman from the rubble. Her mother and grandmother also emerged safely.

But this hegemony cannot last forever. Eventually the throne will have to be shared. The world of hip-hop has some diversity: Eminem, Mac Miller and Nicki Minaj now; the Beastie Boys, Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott in the past.

By 10 a.m., you’re staring at the wall, even squinting at it between your fingertips. Is this day 50 hours long? Soon, you fall into a light, unsatisfying sleep and awake dizzy or with a pounding headache; all your limbs feel weighed down.

2011-12-23,Roberto Bolaño Plays With History,"Roberto Bolaño is one of the most prolific of dead writers: some half a dozen books in Spanish and at least twice that in English since his death (at the age of 50) in 2003. Of course he didn’t write these works in the afterlife, even if such a feat is no doubt every author’s fantasy; the bulk of the posthumous material is drawn from the beginning and middle of his career, before the Spanish publication of “The Savage Detectives” in 1998 turned him into an international phenomenon. The amount of unpublished work tells a story. We read these previously missing early texts differently because we have the later ones. It is also possible that the early work will help us with the later work. (This is likely to be true of the still untranslated “Sinsabores del Verdadero Policía,” published in Spanish this year, which Bolaño was working on from the 1980s to his death. Literally, a sinsabor is something that lacks savor, but idiomatically the word means a minor unpleasantness — a fluent literary version of the title might be “The Troubles of the True Policeman.”)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/books/review/the-third-reich-by-roberto-bolano-book-review.html

One of the first writers of the post-Elvis era to take the popular music of his time seriously, he never liked black music and thought the blues were overrated, negligible in comparison with the work of overtly cerebral and conspicuously poetic artists of the ’60s and early ’70s like Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne. Nelson revered Browne. He subscribed, both in his writing and in his life, to the macho outcast myths of noir movies and pulp fiction, and he seemed blind to the importance of the great female artists nearly absent in his writing, like Joni Mitchell and Aretha Franklin.

2011-12-23,Inside the List,"THE USUAL SUSPECTS: Tom Clancy’s fans like to describe his macho geek-boy thrillers as prescient, citing among other things his 1994 novel “Debt of Honor,” in which a deranged pilot crashes a 747 into the Capitol. On Sept. 11, 2001, Clancy himself played up the overlap on CNN, without mentioning that the book is a ludicrous alarmist fantasy about a corporate-controlled Japan making war on America. In other words, it was less prescient than derivative: “Rising Sun,” Michael Crichton’s version of “The Japanese are coming!” had been a best seller two years before. In a telephone interview on “Charlie Rose” later on 9/11, Clancy again seemed out of the loop. As Rose’s panelists talked about Osama bin Laden and the possibility of military retaliation, Clancy jumped in petulantly. “Saying ‘Osama bin Laden,’ ” he insisted, “is like Claude Rains in ‘Casablanca’ saying, ‘Round up the usual suspects.’ He’s simply the usual suspect. But there has been no definitive information linking him to this event. Until there is, talking about him is just a waste of air.” Later on the program, as the former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger tried to answer a question, Clancy’s disembodied voice floated over the set. “Why is there a car in our driveway?” he asked, apparently forgetting he was wired for sound.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/inside-the-list.html

At least 16 people were killed and thousands near the dumping areas were sickened, the Ivory Coast government said. The court found Trafigura guilty of concealing the dangerous nature of the sludge, a mix of oil-products waste and caustic chemicals, when its ship, the Probo Koala, delivered its load to the Netherlands in 2006 for treatment and disposal. After deciding it would be cheaper to dispose of the load elsewhere, Trafigura then illegally exported the waste to the Ivory Coast, the court said. The company, which has denied wrongdoing, has paid Ivory Coast a settlement of close to $200 million. A spokesman for the company called the decision disappointing but did not say if the company would appeal to the country’s highest court.

A judge in Palma, Majorca, called on the son-in-law, Iñaki Urdangarin, 43, to face questioning on Feb. 6 about allegations that he used his royal credentials to secure multimillion-dollar contracts for his foundation, the Noós Institute, to organize sports and tourism events. After he was named as a formal suspect on Thursday, the Spanish palace and a number of government institutions issued careful comments offering “respect” for the decision of judges. The king has taken a number of steps to keep a distance from his son-in-law, whose family did not spend Christmas Eve with the royal family for the first time in years.

2011-12-30,California: Court Allows Elimination of Redevelopment Agencies," The State Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature had the right to eliminate local redevelopment agencies, redirecting more than $1 billion to help close a huge budget gap. The state began authorizing the agencies in the 1940s to subsidize construction in rundown areas. After the Legislature voted to abolish them this summer, several cities and agencies sued, saying the state had no right to the funds. The court said that abolishing the agencies was “a proper exercise of the legislative power vested in the Legislature” and that the government could “establish or dissolve local agencies and subdivisions as it sees fit.” The Legislature also approved a plan allowing cities to reorganize the agencies if they agreed to use the money for state obligations this year, but the court ruled that plan invalid, effectively eliminating the nearly 400 agencies.

When he left me, the most boring book seemed delightful.” Catherine read plenty in Russian, Massie reports, “but French was the language she preferred, and she read French books indiscriminately, picking up whatever her ladies-in-waiting happened to be reading. She always kept a book in her room and carried another in her pocket.” The empress eventually bought Diderot’s library for more than £50,000, thus sealing her reputation as a patron of the arts and making the rest of Europe finally take notice of Russia as a cultural center.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/books/review/inside-the-list.html

This history of modern communications — covering phones, radio, television, movies and, finally, the Internet — is organized around what Wu calls “the Cycle”: “from somebody’s hobby to somebody’s industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel — from open to closed system.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/paperback-row.html
2011-12-30,The Dirt About Gossip,"Most of us scriveners feel obliged to call our books something catchy in the hope of impressing potential readers with how clever we are. Not so Joseph Epstein. “What’s your book about?” “Gossip.” “What’s it called?” “Gossip.” Epstein has repeatedly opted for titles with the generic ring of labels on the files he must have kept for his research: “Ambition,” “Friendship,” “Snobbery,” “Envy.” On the part of any other writer, this might be taken as a sign of laziness or exhaustion. But in Epstein’s case, it seems a bold grab to own a great big subject, even — or especially — one on which the Almighty has had a tendency to dominate the conversation.

Sex is the only thing that has ever come easily to her. When the boys used to take her down in the dirt or in the back seats of stripped cars in her front yard, she could escape briefly, pretend to be Psyche, Eurydice, Daphne, her favorite nymphs and goddesses from the Greek myths. But Manny, the boy who put the baby inside her, won’t look at her anymore. Esch can’t lie down in the dirt and pretend to be someone else or anywhere else. She’s stuck in shabby Bois Sauvage, a predominantly black Mississippi bayou town in the direct path of a hurricane they’re calling Katrina.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/salvage-the-bones-by-jesmyn-ward-book-review.html

2011-12-30,The Strange Second Life of a Michigan Factory Town,"According to the quote from the unelected Mr. Harris about the city finance director he fired: “He was smart and articulate, but he just wasn’t doing anything that I couldn’t do.” Is that the new criterion for dissolving democracy? I find this situation very troubling. If a corporation has laudable reasons for establishing a company town, it should do the things that uplift the residents and help them participate in their own stability. It is obvious that what Whirlpool and the current state government were really after was a takeover of the shorefront property for a resort that benefits the wealthy outsiders and edges out the undesirable community who has been gifted the shorefront land. Being poor does not negate protection under the law and does not eliminate any American’s constitutional rights. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/reply-all-benton-harbor.html

In the evening I met the newspaper trucks for the night editions and rolled them back to a corner candy store on Fordham Road and Sedgwick Avenue.

2011-12-30,The Pakistanis Have a Point,"The article by Bill Keller is an incisive and balanced analysis of what has brought the Pakistan-United States relationship to its low point. Both sides have no clear understanding of the vital interests of the other. For Pakistan, it is not in its interest to antagonize the Taliban, who are sure to come back to power in Afghanistan once the Americans leave, but at the very least, it can prevent the Taliban from attacking U.S. and NATO forces from its soil and not give any support in the planning and execution of such attacks. On the other hand, the U.S. fails to understand how alarming it is for Pakistan, and rightfully so, to see the growing strengthening of the India-Afghanistan axis, both its bitter enemies. Successive Afghan governments since the day that Pakistan was created have maintained a very hostile attitude except for the few years under Taliban rule. Therefore, in order not to have two unfriendly neighbors, Pakistan has chosen to bet on the return of the Taliban.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/reply-all-pakistanis-have-a-point.html

He also supports many worthy medical, educational and arts organizations, but I think those good works buy the complicity of the institutions in question. I’m sure my granddaughter would have liked to see the show, but rather than validate this patron’s actions and beliefs, I boycotted it. Should those who feel as I do have joined me?

The first known record of the venerable paperweight-turned-kitsch-souvenir, writes Nancy McMichael in “Snowdomes,” the definitive account of the tchotchke, was entered in the 1878 “Reports of the United States Commissioners to the Paris Universal Exposition.” It tells of seven French contraptions featuring heavy glass paperweights filled with water and “white powder, which, when turned upside down, falls in imitation of a snowstorm.” Eleven years later, the next exposition showcased both the 986-foot-tall Eiffel Tower and an inches-tall ceramic replica in a water-filled dome.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/the-self-contained-snowstorm.html

A 35-foot statue of the Protestant theologian (1603?-1683) stands high in Prospect Terrace Park, with right hand extended, as if blessing the city he founded.

2011-12-30,Remembering Richard Holbrooke,"In the spring of 1991 Strobe Talbott, who would become deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, visited Richard Holbrooke at his weekend home in Connecticut. After playing tennis and going for a swim, they had brunch at a neighbor’s house. But when Holbrooke saw a trampoline on the far side of a manicured lawn, he excused himself, hopped onto the canvas and insisted that Talbott join him. “The result,” Talbott recalls, “was an exceedingly amateurish blend of gymnastic duet and duel — sometimes semicoordinated, sometimes dangerously competitive and constantly accompanied by talk, most of it coming from Richard. The subject, naturally, was world affairs.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/the-unquiet-american-richard-holbrooke-in-the-world-edited-by-derek-chollet-and-samantha-power-book-review.html

Even the chilliest of realists have shuddered at our capability for radioactive massacre. In 1977, the strategist George F. Kennan declared, “No one is good enough, wise enough, steady enough, to have control over the volume of explosives that now rest in the hands of this country.” Nuclear arms, he concluded, “shouldn’t exist at all.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/the-partnership-five-cold-warriors-and-their-quest-to-ban-the-bomb-by-philip-taubman-book-review.html

Or you can fill them with pulpish aliens and gun-toting molls, and they happily motor on, outlasting all those snobbish Pulitzer winners who once sneered at them (not to mention their rarefied panels of judges). That’s because stories don’t need much to survive, just a situation worth pursuing, a character worthy of pursuing it and three magical Aristotelian ingredients: beginning, middle and end.

It is hardly surprising that the movie’s sweep and ambition have figured so prominently in discussions of it, whether as sources of wonder or bafflement. The dinosaurs that appear briefly and memorably about 30 minutes into the film have become conversation pieces and symbols of Mr. Malick’s audacity, even as their peculiar grace earned them an honored place in the impressively crowded cinema menagerie of 2011, alongside the loyal terrier of “The Artist” and the noble steed of “War Horse.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/movies/awardsseason/a-o-scott-on-the-musical-movement-of-the-tree-of-life.html

In “Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet,” he makes sure his main character gets more than pedestrian relief from her new podiatrist.
