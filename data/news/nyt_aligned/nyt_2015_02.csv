The words are now a shorthand for support of freedom of expression. The sign is the creation of Joachim Roncin, 39, the art director of Stylist, a free Paris weekly magazine. Now, with the aid of pro bono lawyers and the good will of France’s patent office, he’s trying to prevent people from capitalizing on it. “I can’t trademark it. It’s not something that belongs to anyone,” Mr. Roncin said in a telephone interview. “If it’s a slogan, it cannot be a brand.” Mr. Roncin said that even arms manufacturers had filed requests with the French patent office, hoping to sell weapons with the phrase. He said that the patent office has said it will not trademark the slogan. Mr. Roncin has only granted Reporters Without Borders permission to use the image to help raise money for Charlie Hebdo. (In its first issue published after the attacks, the magazine ran a cartoon depicting people in Bangladesh hunched over sewing machines sewing “Je Suis Charlie” T-shirts.) Mr. Roncin posted his image on Twitter not long after the killings. With only around 400 Twitter followers, he expected only a few friends to share the image, but it swept across social media, and tens of thousands marched in Paris on Jan. 11 holding “Je Suis Charlie” signs. “It’s incredible,” Mr. Roncin said. “Now it’s crazy.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/arts/design/theres-no-branding-a-symbol-of-free-speech.html

Her debut exhibition will celebrate the work of Lynn Hershman Leeson, a 73-year-old artist whose prescient mixed-media creations began addressing the relationship between gender and technology as early as the 1960s. Following that, Donahue will host a show featuring the work of the artist and fashion designer Susan Cianciolo, whose homespun zines, pillows and clothing demonstrate artisanal flair and a subversive sensibility that fits the space.

Lipes, whose varied credits include “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” several episodes of “Girls,” a Jay Z video and the dance film “NY Export: Opus Jazz,” follows the rising choreographer Justin Peck as he creates an original work for the New York City Ballet (the company’s 422nd): “Paz de La Jolla,” a critically-lauded reverie set on the beaches of his native Southern California. Lipes captures the young dance-maker and his collaborators during every step of the two-month process, from the first choreographic sketches through costume and lighting design to the premiere. The result is a vivid, multifaceted depiction of the hard and necessary work of making art for the 21st century. In the exclusive clip above, Peck observes and corrects several of the company’s dazzlingly fast dancers during a rehearsal.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/ballet-422-new-york-city-ballet-documentary-exclusive-video-clip/

2015-02-03,North Korea: Investigator Rules Out Reforms by Kim," The special United Nations investigator of human rights abuses in North Korea suggested in an interview published Monday that the ruling Kim family must be replaced before the country’s extensive network of prison camps can be broken up. The investigator, Marzuki Darusman, emphasized in the interview with The Associated Press that he was not advocating force to oust North Korea’s government. But in discussing how to end abuses, most notably in the North’s penal system, he was quoted as saying: “That can only happen if this cult leadership system is completely dismantled. And the only way to do that is if the Kim family is effectively displaced, is effectively removed from the scene, and a new leadership comes into place.” North Korea’s rights abuses were documented in a United Nations report published last year, which the government of Kim Jong-un has denounced as propaganda orchestrated by the United States.

Over in the 11th, at 6036 — a 14-seat izakaya named for the distance, in miles, between Paris and Tokyo — the chef Haruka Casters plays up seasonal small plates (sake-steamed clams with cabbage, teriyaki burgers). “Paris is a cosmopolitan city with many opportunities to improve one’s cooking,” says Casters. “But it’s also much easier to be seen here than in a megalopolis like Tokyo.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/t-magazine/japanese-chefs-paris-neige-dete-resto6036.html

He was the 16th president of the United States and the first one killed in office. (A madman once tried to shoot Andrew Jackson, but both of his pistols misfired.) An assassination is treason by way of murder. Lincoln’s assassination was more — an act of war. Lee surrendered to Grant on April 9. Lincoln was the last of the Union dead. His death had another meaning, too.

Their critics have claimed they do so because they fear being held accountable for how much children learn. But over the past few years, on both the right and the left, in scattered suburbs and in urban neighborhoods, a small yet growing group of parents have begun to join teachers in denouncing standardized testing. They complain about the narrowing of the school curriculum to the questions asked on high-stakes exams, the many hours and days — sometimes up to a quarter of the school year — spent testing and prepping for tests, and the stress that testing imposes on children. Some parents even have their children opt out of standardized testing altogether.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/the-test-by-anya-kamenetz.html

The Caribbean island, a British overseas territory about seven miles north of St. Maarten/St. Martin, is a blip on the radar — a mere 35 square miles with just six traffic lights. It’s dry and flat, and its tourism scene took off only some 20 years ago; until the 1960s, after all, much of the island lacked electricity and telephone service. Yet fabulous Anguilla is home to some of the region’s toniest resorts, epicurean eateries and breathtaking beaches. It has architecturally striking villas like those at Altamer, named for exotic gemstones. And it is a magnet for celebrities like Kevin Bacon and Jimmy Buffett, a kind of British St. Bart’s. Without the pretension, though — Anguillan style is a perfect paradox: unfussy chic, barefoot elegance. There are no cruise ships, casinos or high-rise hotels, but there is a thriving local music scene, headed by notable up-and-coming singer-songwriters like Omari Banks and Ruel Richardson, and showcased at Moonsplash, the island’s annual reggae festival. And the fabulous factor grows with every season: luxe hotel unveilings include Malliouhana, reopened late last year after a three-year overhaul, along with coming debuts of Zemi Beach Resort and Spa, an opulent 115-room resort, and the Reef by CuisinArt, a boutique hotel powered by a four-acre solar field.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-anguilla.html

Its location — to use the name of the Stephen Adly Guirgis play opening at Second Stage on Feb. 11 — is “Between Riverside and Crazy,” and it is a place where distinctions of mental health and morality blur vividly. First seen in an Atlantic Theater Company production last summer, this constantly surprising work from Mr. Guirgis (author of the unprintably titled “The ______ With the Hat”) tells the story of a retired police officer (the wonderful Stephen McKinley Henderson) doing his best to hold onto to his dignity, his family and, most crucially, a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side. Mr. Henderson’s character is called Pops, but this angry old man is far less cozy and more complicated than his folksy nickname suggests. The same is true of this play, directed by Austin Pendleton with a sharp ear for everyday urban ambivalence.

Her lesser books, like “A Patchwork Planet” and “Noah’s Compass,” stumble into predictability and cliché. Ms. Tyler’s latest novel, “A Spool of Blue Thread,” unfortunately falls into that category.

Long housed in a block-filling chunk of Beaux-Arts granite that also held an art school, the museum had limited exhibition space and could show only a fraction of its holdings of 17,000 works. Now nearly half of them are being absorbed into the National Gallery of Art. And maybe just as important, the remainder will be parceled out to other Washington-area museums, raising the chances that, with a little schlepping, we’ll eventually be able to see more of the Corcoran than we could when it was intact.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/a-partial-look-at-the-corcoran-collection.html

But in fact, according to Al Qadiri, the group’s modus operandi is less deliberate than it seems. “It’s all on accident,” as Al Qadiri says, backstage at a show at Los Angeles’ Catch One disco. “The thing that unites Future Brown is that there’s very little agenda.” The four D.J.s, who sit at the intersection of music, art and fashion, are linked through their ties to DIS Magazine, a tongue-in-cheek lifestyle webzine that Al Qadiri describes as an incubator for artists working in different mediums. “We’re indebted to curators that want to bring fresh air into the art world,” Al Qadiri says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/future-brown-album-vernaculo/

The clothes the characters wear, how they talk and what they talk about, the grainy texture of the images and the weariness of the world they capture — all of these emerge from a time capsule devoted to an era that doesn’t quite have a name.

Globally, and for the most part even within countries, a rise in debt isn’t an indication that we’re living beyond our means, because as Fatas puts it, one person’s debt is another person’s asset; or as I equivalently put it, debt is money we owe to ourselves — an obviously true statement that, I have discovered, has the power to induce blinding rage in many people.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/debt-is-money-we-owe-to-ourselves/

2015-02-06,Mo Yan’s ‘Frog’,"In October 2012, Mo Yan became the first citizen of mainland China to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Since then, he has been attacked both inside and outside China for his collaboration with the Communist literary establishment: for his vice chairmanship of the state writers’ association, for remarking that censorship falls in the same category as airport security. In the summer of 2012, he controversially hand-copied, for a special commemorative edition, part of the 1942 “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” Mao Zedong’s statement of orthodoxy on the arts that became the theoretical ur-text of Chinese socialist realism and literary censorship. Yet readers will find little in “Frog,” Howard Gold­blatt’s fluent translation of Mo Yan’s 2009 novel about his country’s one-child policy, that validates the society created by the Chinese Communist Party. It is an anarchic, brutal book about the inhumanity of servants of the Communist state, the inadequacy of Chinese men and the moral vacuum at the heart of post-Mao China.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/mo-yans-frog.html

The phrase resonates in three new picture books that highlight issues of race, gender and justice. These stories — about Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Susan B. Anthony, and the Loving v. Virginia case that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage — all have main characters with a steadfast determination to change their lives. They are willing to fight their known hell for an unknown, possibly harsher fate. In each book, the law looms as a character, too, a force that can save lives or kill spirits.

Leovy is a longtime reporter for The Los Angeles Times, where for years she maintained the Homicide Report blog to track every murder in the county, in an effort to “communicate the horror of it,” as she said on NPR’s “Fresh Air” recently. “I don’t like blogs very much,” she told the host Dave Davies. “You can scan a newspaper front page and get an idea of what you need to be thinking about very quickly. A blog is just a stack, an undifferentiated stack of news. You can’t tell the trivial from the weighty. And so it doesn’t work for a lot of things — but it occurred to me that it would work for this, that the form would suit what I was trying to say exactly, which is to give everything equal weight. . . .

Richard Brookhiser, the award-winning author of biographies of the founding fathers, now adds to that list, venturing past the Revolution into a new era to explore the life of this most written-about American. In many ways, however, this is less a book in which Brookhiser moves forward in time than one that endeavors to pull Lincoln back into the 18th century, claiming him, in the title’s words, as fundamentally the “founders’ son.” Brookhiser casts Lincoln as what might today be called an originalist, a leader who applied the doctrines of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in accordance with the founders’ intentions in order to chart his way through a new national crisis.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/founders-son-a-life-of-abraham-lincoln-by-richard-brookhiser.html

2015-02-06,"‘X,’ a Novel About Malcolm X","It would be fascinating to get Malcolm X’s take on the current surge of racial tension in America. At first glance, we seem to have made great strides toward equality since the civil rights movement. We elected Barack Obama, a black man, president. Twice. We almost universally condemn outright racism. But is it possible that racism (most notably against African-­Americans) hasn’t receded so much as it has evolved and become more refined? “The elegant racist,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has written, “knows how to injure nonwhite people while never summoning the specter of white guilt.” Housing segregation, for instance, is both devastating and hard to detect. And according to the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform, racial minorities are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be convicted and to face stiff sentences. With recent racially charged events like the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York City — as well as the rising plea for more representation of minorities in children’s literature from the We Need Diverse Books movement — I can’t think of a more appropriate time for a book about the early years of Malcolm X.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/x-a-novel-about-malcolm-x.html

In Willhelm’s hands, geometric cuts and experimental textiles explore not utility, but the sometimes messy rules of attraction — and he’s quick to cite the adage that we put on clothes hoping someone else will take them off later. “I think if you have sex with somebody it’s very, very important that you have a little laugh together,” says Willhelm, noting that he was the first cover boy for the magazine Butt. “When sex gets too serious it’s unbearable, and that’s the same with sexy fashion.” This good-humored dedication to liberation is on full display in Willhelm’s exhibition “When Fashion Shows the Danger Then Fashion Is the Danger,” co-conceived with his longtime collaborator Jutta Kraus, and opening this weekend at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/bernhard-willhelm-moca-exhibit/
2015-02-06,1940: Canadian Ship Torpedoed,"LONDON — The first Canadian ship of the war to be lost, the 9,874-ton Beaverburn, of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company, was torpedoed by a German submarine off the southern coast of Ireland today [Feb. 6]. Other ships in the vicinity hurried to the scene and rescued all but one of the seventy-seven members of the crew. Constructed in 1928, the Beaverburn was one of the fastest Canadian freighters and carried the most modern equipement for fruit refrigeration. Its attacker was believed to be the same submarine unofficially reported in the trans-Atlantic shipping lane off Cornwall peninsula. Fifty-four members of the 100-man crew of the 875-ton British minesweeper Sphinx were lost when it foundered yesterday as it was being towed to port, after having been attacked by German planes. The captain and four seamen were killed during the attack and the other forty-nine were drowned. During the week ending February 5, eight British merchant-ships, totaling 25,069 tons, and six neutral ships totaling 17,546 tons, were lost by enemy action. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Feb. 7, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/1940-canadian-ship-torpedoed/

He asked them to kiss, and he clicked the shutter. Three months later, on Dec. 8, 1980, John Lennon was fatally shot at the entrance to the Dakota, home to him and his wife, Yoko Ono. Just three weeks prior to Lennon’s death, Shinoyama’s photograph of John and Yoko’s kiss at Central Park Pond had appeared on the cover of what would be their final studio album, “Double Fantasy.” Shinoyama made other photographs that day, of course — 800 in all, in fact — but many of them have never been shown until now, on the occasion of Taschen’s forthcoming publication of “Kishin Shinoyama.

2015-02-09,Mexico: State Officials Find 60 Bodies Inside an Abandoned Crematorium," The bodies of 60 men, women and children have been found piled in an abandoned crematorium in Acapulco, the authorities in Guerrero State said Friday, but they appeared to have been prepared for cremation and then left behind rather than dumped there by drug gangs. “It is another kind of crime,” said Osbaldo Berber, an adviser to the state prosecutor. The crematorium, Cremaciones Pacífico, above, had been closed for a year, and the bodies, which were found Thursday night, had been embalmed and doused with quicklime to cover the scent of decomposition, officials said. Investigators are gathering local funeral home records to determine the identities of the bodies, the prosecutor’s office said, and are considering charges of improper burial and abuse of a corpse. The owner of the crematorium, Guillermo Estua Zerdain, is missing, officials said. With no sign of organized crime, the discovery of the corpses appears to be unconnected to the case of 43 missing college students believed to have been rounded up by corrupt police officers and turned over to a drug gang in Guerrero in September.

2015-02-09,Venezuela: Grocery Chain to Be Seized," Ratcheting up a conflict with retailers of basic goods, President Nicolás Maduro on Friday ordered the government takeover of a supermarket chain that officials have accused of hoarding products as part of an “economic war” against his government. Mr. Maduro did not name the company, which he said had 35 medium-size stores in seven states, but it was clear that he was referring to the Día a Día chain. The stores are generally located in lower-middle-class or poor neighborhoods. Promising to use an “iron fist” in tackling economic problems, Mr. Maduro said the chain, which had a warehouse full of cooking oil and other items, was “making war on the people” and would be taken over by a government supermarket network known as Pdval. Venezuela has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil, its only major export, and shortages and long lines at stores are common. Also on Friday, the government filed criminal charges against a manager of the supermarket chain, accusing him of destabilizing the economy. It filed similar charges this week against two executives of the country’s largest pharmacy chain, Farmatodo.

2015-02-09,What’s on TV Saturday,"1:15 P.M. (Starz Cinema) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance in Paris (“Before Sunset”) that began nine years before that in Vienna (“Before Sunrise”), Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are in Greece, at the end of a vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), the son Jesse left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with Hank. Celine sees his question as a demand. And so they will fight about this — and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women — throughout the course of a day. “ ‘Before Sunrise,’ ‘Before Sunset’ and ‘Before Midnight’ are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists’ offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this trilogy from the director Richard Linklater. This final installment, he added, “is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect.” “Before Sunset” will be shown at 8:40 a.m. on HBO2.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

A decade ago, as a doctor in the intensive care unit at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, I met Vincent — I’m using this name to protect his privacy — on his ninth stay of the year. He was a “frequent flier,” back and forth between the I.C.U. and his nursing home down the street. He would come in dying, we’d plug him into life support, treat his infection, pump up his blood pressure and send him back to the nursing home. But then he’d deflate like an old tire and be rolled back in by paramedics within anywhere from three days to three weeks.

2015-02-09,"Ancient Savagery, and How It Worked","As blood sports go, the Super Bowl has nothing on the Colosseum and its events. Built near Nero’s onetime pleasure palace by the emperor Vespasian as a symbol of Roman military might, the amphitheater (capacity: 50,000 or so) boasted gladiators, wild beasts, crucifixions and elaborately staged Greek myths that often didn’t end well for the performers, as when criminals were catapulted above the arena to recreate Icarus’s flight toward the sun. The pièce de résistance might be a mock sea battle, the better for mass drownings, in which the amphitheater would be flooded in the morning and drained in time for the afternoon mayhem. But how, exactly, was all this achieved? With a labyrinthine system of underground pulleys, lifts and trap doors to rival the most elaborate Broadway show, says Heinz-Jürgen Beste of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. In “Colosseum: Roman Death Trap,” the first installment of “Building Wonders” on “Nova,” Wednesdays on PBS, Mr. Beste proves his point, recreating an ancient lifting machine to release a wolf into the arena.

The statues, known as the Wolsey Angels, were commissioned in 1524, just before the cardinal lost his power after failing to convince the pope to annul the king’s marriage. The cardinal appeared in Hilary Mantel’s novel “Wolf Hall.” Ms. Mantel said in a statement that the recovery of the angels “is one of those miracles that historians pray for; something that seems irrevocably lost has been there all the time.” After Wolsey’s death in 1530, Henry VIII acquired the statues for his own tomb, which was never completed. They were eventually sold during the 1640s to raise money during England’s Civil War and were unheard of again until two surfaced at an auction in 1994. The other pair was discovered in 2008 at a country house in Northamptonshire in central England. The majority of the funds for the purchase came from a two-million pound grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, while another 500,000 pounds came from the Art Fund, a charity that helps British museums purchase art. Additional funds came from donations and museum supporters — including 33,000 pounds from on-site donations and one-pound “Save the Wolsey Angels” badges. The statutes are on display at the museum but will be temporarily removed to undergo conservation treatment.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/arts/design/wolsey-angels-to-go-to-the-va-museum.html

Directed by Amma Asante and written by Misan Sagay, the film chronicles the challenging love life of Belle, an educated beauty — including a dashing suitor, John Davinier (Sam Reid), as well as several not-so-charming ones. The movie also covers Belle’s uncle, the lord chief justice who must decide on a case involving a Zong slave ship on which more than 130 Africans were massacred for an insurance payment. “The movie plays with the historical record for dramatic effect, as is often the case when the past is disinterred for entertainment, and its realism at times groans under the weight of too many passionate speeches,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Yet the weave of the personal and the political finally proves as irresistible as it is moving, partly because it has been drawn from extraordinary life.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

(TCM) CHARADE (1963) A Parisian widow (Audrey Hepburn) tries to find her murdered husband’s hidden fortune with the help of a vacation acquaintance (Cary Grant) while eluding the killers who want it themselves in this romantic, Hitchcockian caper directed by Stanley Donen. And while this film includes scenes of “ghoulish humor” and “gruesome violence,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, “there’s a lot to be said for it as a fast-moving, urbane entertainment.” Hepburn, he added, “is cheerfully committed to a mood of how-nuts-can-you-be in an obviously comforting assortment of expensive Givenchy costumes, and Mr. Grant does everything from taking a shower without removing his suit to fighting with thugs, all with the blandness and the boredom of an old screwball comedy hand.” Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer received an Oscar nomination for their song “Charade.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Creating the bangle’s elaborate architecture required nearly 500 hours and the skill of 10 craftspeople — Van Cleef’s so-called “Mains d’Or,” or golden hands — among them a designer, a model maker, a lapidary, a gem setter and experts in hard stones, pearls and diamonds.

Yet to many veterans, his story offers a chance to discuss and debate a remarkable array of complex and personal questions: the mix of motivations that lead people to sign up in the military, the riot of emotions troops feel when they kill or witness death, the struggle to reengage with civilian society upon coming home.

The references to slavery and segregation inspired debates about how deeply religion was implicated in those institutions (the short answer: a lot more deeply than many Christian conservatives care to admit today, though not in exactly the same way that religion is implicated in the crimes of ISIS; the South was many things, including a home to terrorism, but it was not a utopian theocracy); the reference to the Inquisition inspired some discussion of just how bad the institution really was (the answer: not as bad as Black Legend-style history would have it, but at its worst quite, quite bad enough).

The move is a departure for Yelp, whose main business has been selling advertising bought by local businesses with those reviews. But Yelp’s growth is starting to slow, and it reported a decrease in regular visitors in its most recent quarter. In a statement, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said the purchase would help Yelp customers more easily do business with companies online. Yelp will have plenty of competitors. GrubHub, an online food ordering company and a longtime competitor of Eat24, recently acquired DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, two delivery services that take food directly to customers who order it through the company. Yelp also faces start-ups like Postmates, which enables customers to order food from almost any restaurant for delivery, and Square, which recently bought the food delivery start-up Caviar. Bigger competitors may be coming, too. Amazon and Google have experimented with on-demand delivery services, and Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, has signaled its own ambitions of becoming a way to deliver anything to anyone.

Missouri law prevents grand jurors from discussing their work in most instances, and the 12-member panel that decided not to indict Mr. Wilson for killing Michael Brown, 18, has remained anonymous. One juror sued last month seeking protection from the restrictions, naming the prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, as the defendant. That lawsuit, which said that the public’s understanding of the grand jury was “not entirely accurate,” indicated a willingness to discuss what happened during the hearings and “advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted.” In the lawsuit, the grand juror, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, indicated a fear of being prosecuted if he or she spoke publicly.

2015-02-11,Midcentury Modernism Arrives in the California Desert,"In the coming days, design and art lovers will descend on the desert east of Los Angeles for the 10th edition of Palm Springs Modernism Week. Among the lectures, house tours, exhibitions and fairs this year, one unofficial event stands out — and even offers the chance for the snowbound to get in on the action. The auction site Paddle8 has partnered with the design firm Homepolish to create “Desert Living: Icons of Modern Design,” a pop-up series of interiors vignettes at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club’s 4,000-square-foot clubhouse space. The four installations, says Jason Stein, Paddle8’s senior design specialist, reflect “what our favorite homes in Palm Springs would be; a setting we’d want to live in.” And though midcentury art and design are, as expected, well represented, the collectibles on offer extend far beyond the “Mad Men”-era nostalgia typically associated with the region. One California-themed tableau includes Frank Gehry’s cardboard chair, Bill Curry’s “Cattail” lamp, John Baldessari prints and an Ed Ruscha painting; another explores the notion of opulence through such pieces as a chrome 1970s Gucci wine cooler and a Helmut Newton nude photograph. And a future-themed area features Gerald McCabe’s seven-stemmed “Daisy” table and artwork by Kenny Scharf, Sam Francis and David Hockney. The environments will be accessible to visitors this weekend and are, Stein promises, “really layered”; for those stuck in less salubrious climes, everything is up for auction starting Wednesday on the Paddle8 site.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/t-magazine/palm-springs-modernism-week-desert-living.html

But Gupta thinks of them as more than discards; these are also someone else’s memories on display. Because he transforms certain objects into larger-than-life, sometimes shocking sculptures, Gupta has been called the “Damien Hirst of New Delhi”; alternately, his methods of appropriating and displaying other people’s objects could be described as Duchampian. The truth is, Gupta is a sentimentalist at heart.

2015-02-11,What’s on TV Wednesday,"7 P.M. (Reelz) INVICTUS (2009) This rousing drama from Clint Eastwood, based on the book “Playing the Enemy” by John Carlin, was inspired by a true story of reconciliation and athletic triumph. Morgan Freeman portrays Nelson Mandela, newly elected as South Africa’s first black president, and Matt Damon is François Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by many blacks. Mandela views the team as a vehicle to bring the country’s races together, especially if it can win the Rugby World Cup tournament in 1995, which South Africa is to host. “ ‘Invictus’ has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.” In “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom” (2013), Justin Chadwick’s biopic, at 6:35 on Showtime, Idris Elba portrays Mandela and Naomie Harris is his wife, Winnie. “Mr. Elba’s towering performance lends ‘Long Walk to Freedom’ a Shakespearean breadth,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. “His Mandela is an intensely emotional man whose body quakes in moments of sorrow and whose face is stricken with a bone-deep anguish. The carefully chosen words in his eloquent declarations of principle, spoken with gravity and deliberation, are deeply stirring.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/arts/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Channing’s request was hardly a surprise; after all, the Capitol had served as a church for many decades, and preachers had long spoken in its halls. What was astonishing was that Garnet was a black man, no longer relegated to the galleries but standing at the speaker’s dais.

Two prison staff members were released unharmed after being held for 14 hours at the Kaohsiung Prison, said the official, Chen Ming-tang, a vice minister in the Justice Ministry. The six inmates, who were all serving lengthy terms for crimes that included drug trafficking and murder, apparently complained about their living conditions to get a meeting with prison officials, whom they then took hostage on Wednesday, according to local news reports. The inmates later took firearms from a prison armory, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported. Taiwanese news outlets broadcast a series of demands from the men, including that they be provided with vehicles and that former President Chen Shui-bian, who was convicted of embezzlement and taking bribes in 2009, be returned to prison. Mr. Chen was released on medical parole in January. But early Thursday, the six inmates shot themselves, Mr. Chen, the ministry official, said in a brief televised interview.

2015-02-12,What Our Paranoia About Drones Says About Us,"A lazy drift of mist obscured an already gray November morning as I stared skeptically skyward in Morningside Park. It was not, I told myself, technically raining; still, moisture had begun to collect in the folds of my jacket as I surveyed the weather conditions. Driven more by impatience than by prudence, I decided to go ahead with the plan. Carefully following the precise sequence prescribed by the instructions, I switched on my remote controller and then the Wi-Fi transmitter, and finally double-pressed the power button on the back of the DJI Phantom 2 Vision quadcopter I purchased the night before. The copter trilled, then emitted four consecutive beeps. The GPS system began searching for satellites to map its launch coordinates, and a moment later the rotors whirred to life, sending ripples across a nearby puddle. And then the drone was airborne, rising to a hover six feet above me, conducting an aerial choreography to maintain its position despite the wind pushing it toward Manhattan Avenue. The copter streamed an image to my iPhone — me with my cap pulled low against the November drizzle, head tilted to meet the camera’s gaze. A drone selfie.

In December, a study suggested that work might be contributing to Americans’ sleep deprivation — its authors argued that “making the work start time more flexible may help increase sleep time; even if total time spent working is kept constant.” And in January, Samantha Cole at Fast Company reported on another study, this one finding that employees who were given flexible schedules and the option to work from home slept more than other workers, and also felt more well rested.",Opinion,https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/does-your-work-fit-your-life/

When “12 Years a Slave” won best picture, only about six million people had seen the film; “Gravity” sold many more theater tickets, but even so, more people watched the Oscars than had seen that movie then. To judge from the recent flurry of culture-war-inflected skirmishes about some of the nominees, it’s clear that it’s no longer a question of whether the Oscars matter but why. Manohla Dargis and A.

2015-02-12,"‘The Whites,’ by Richard Price Writing as Harry Brandt","Many years ago, in a magazine interview, Richard Price (now the author of nine novels, including “Clockers” and “Lush Life”) was asked why he devoted so much of his considerable literary talent to crime fiction and film scripts featuring criminals. He responded by saying that when you circle around a murder long enough you get to know a city. I cut that line out of the magazine and taped it above my computer screen. For several years, it presided over what I wrote in my own novels. With that answer, I believed that Price had crystallized what many writers knew and attempted to practice. That is, he considered the crime novel something more than a puzzle and an entertainment; he saw it as societal reflection, documentation and investigation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/books/review/the-whites-by-richard-price-writing-as-harry-brandt.html

Built from paper, cardboard and wood painted white, these grids dominate the show, their units square or rectangular, their perpendicular divisions thick or thin.

Martha’s Vineyard, where much of the action takes place, looks pretty good too. And though there are episodes of bloody mayhem and steamy sex, the mood is contemplative, at times almost serene.

The long-suffering title character desperately wants to be free of her husband, who refuses to let her go. So year after year, Viviane pleads her case before a rabbinic court, waiting for her divorce as days slip into weeks and then months, her pacific face glazed with tears and her body occasionally rocked by a laugh tinged with knowing and madness.

2015-02-13,Colorado: Senate Rejects Funding Plan for Driver’s Licenses for Immigrants,"An effort to fund the state program that provides driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants has failed, leaving the program with little ability to function. On Thursday, State Senator Jessie Ulibarri, a Democrat, submitted an amendment that would have assigned funds collected from immigrant applicants to pay for the program. The Republican-controlled Senate voted down the measure. Unauthorized immigrants can receive driver’s licenses in 10 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Colorado’s program began in 2014, and state motor vehicle offices issuing these license have been swamped with requests from immigrants. But critics maintain that the program rewards people who have crossed into the country without authorization. Last month, the state’s joint budget committee voted not to approve about $166,000 in new funds for the program, forcing officials to lay off workers and stop issuing the licenses at four of the five participating motor vehicle offices. One office, in Denver, was left to process the licenses. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/us/colorado-senate-rejects-funding-plan-for-drivers-licenses-for-immigrants.html

The assertion by the Islamic State, published in an English-language version of its online jihadist propaganda magazine, is believed to be the first time the group has said anything concerning the whereabouts of the woman, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26. French officials suspect that she was an accomplice of the gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, killed in a Jan. 9 shootout with the French police. The article asserted that Mr. Coulibaly had arranged for her travel to lands controlled by the Islamic State before the attack. She was quoted as saying that she was happy to be living in an area controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and was quoted as advising other women followers of the group to “be bases of support and safety for your husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons.” Turkish officials have said that Ms. Boumeddiene traveled to Turkey from Spain before the Paris attack and entered Syria through a Turkish border crossing on Jan. 8, one day before the supermarket siege.

2015-02-13,What’s on TV Friday,"3:45 P.M. (TCM) THE BIRDS (1963) A flock of birds never looks quite the same after a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic horror film about a California town tormented by malevolent fowl. Tippi Hedren stars as a spoiled socialite who follows a handsome man (Rod Taylor) to the home of his mother (Jessica Tandy), where, for no apparent reason, the attacks begin. “Making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be one of nature’s most innocent creatures and one of man’s most melodious friends, Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

The idea was that it would be an informal, incisive discussion of various developments in the world of culture and media. Sometimes it managed to live up to its name, and sometimes it didn’t, but for me the show — or webcast, or schmooze fest, or whatever it was — had a much simpler reason for being: It guaranteed that I would have a few hours a week in the company of David Carr.

During her glamorous previous life in the 1990s, Newbery was the assistant to Susan Train, the legendary Paris bureau chief of American Vogue, and later served as office manager for John Galliano, back when he was being courted by LVMH to take over Givenchy. Next, she moved to London where she penned three rollicking romans à clef about the fashion industry, before leaving that world for good. Today, with her press-shy English husband, Newbery runs Common Farm Flowers, a floral company that delivers cheerful bouquets and centerpieces by mail throughout Britain. They grow most of the flowers organically themselves at Common Farm, a seven-acre spread with a ramshackle house they are restoring. Newbery has also returned to her original love of writing and combined it with her third career as a florist, producing “The Flower Farmer’s Year: How to Grow Cut Flowers for Pleasure and Profit” ($30, Green Books), a richly illustrated how-to guide in which Newbery shares all that she has learned in her 10 years in the fields of southern England.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/georgie-newbery-flower-farmers-year/

2015-02-13,Inside the List,"Adaptation, Part I: Readers who have kept tabs on Nick Hornby’s career might not be surprised that his new novel, “Funny Girl” — new at No. 9 on the hardcover fiction list — devotes considerable attention to a couple of scriptwriters. That’s because Hornby, who made his name with the 1995 novel “High Fidelity,” has lately embraced Hollywood in a big way. He received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for the 2009 movie “An Education” (adapted from Lynn Barber’s memoir), then went on to adapt Cheryl Strayed’s “Wild,” currently in theaters, and Colm Toibin’s novel “Brooklyn,” which had its premiere last month at Sundance. (Interestingly, Hornby did not write the screenplay for “High Fidelity,” which jumped to film in 2000, or any of his other books to become movies — confirming the wisdom that it’s better to operate on other people’s children than your own.) In a recent online interview with The Atlantic, Hornby, who is British, explained why he had actively pursued the “Wild” gig: “There’s a side of me that responds very deeply to American things,” he said. “The book to me felt like a Springsteen album. I always loved Springsteen, but he’s very American. That kind of directness is really interesting to me because it doesn’t have to be unsubtle. It’s just a different way of being, a different way of thinking.

2015-02-16,1915: Britain Hails Air Raid’s Success,"LONDON — All England is rejoicing to-day [Feb. 13] at the superb flight of her great air fleet, thirty-four strong, across the Channel, with not a serious injury to a pilot, and accidents to only two of the machines. It seems almost incredible that it was only five years ago that Blériot made the pioneer aeroplane trip across the Channel, so vast and rapid has been the progress since. The raid not only represents the largest fleet of air craft that has ever operated together, but it is a fitting reply to the German bombardment of British towns, and a warning to the Kaiser’s forces in Belgium of further damage. One fact well demonstrated by the raid is that in case of such an attack, land guns are unreliable defences, and it is necessary to meet aeroplanes with aeroplanes. The attack probably puts an end to Germany’s reputed intention to use Zeebrugge and other places on the Belgian coast as bases for submarines. The Admiralty states that no submarines were seen. This indicates that German preparations are too incomplete for them to trust these craft in Belgian harbors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Feb. 14, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/1915-britain-hails-air-raids-success/

Starting Thursday, a broad sweep of her unsettling work will inaugurate Bridget Donahue, a new gallery on the Lower East Side being opened by a longtime director at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, the West Village gallery. Ms. Donahue said she had been drawn to Ms. Hershman Leeson as a kind of prophet of “our cybernetic condition,” through early interactive works that delved into artificial intelligence and surveillance and yearslong performances that blurred the line between acting and life. The show, “Origins of the Species,” through April 5, will span from the late 1960s to recent work exploring the implications of genetic manipulation. (99 Bowery, 2nd floor; bridgetdonahue.nyc.)

We pay a visit to Sharjah, where the progressive sheikh’s daughter, Hoor Al Qasimi, has inherited — and subsequently boosted the profile of — a humble but growing art expo with some serious indie cred. Stateside, we take a closer look at Philip Johnson’s iconic Glass House, which may be the late architect’s greatest achievement (even if it’s not quite right to call it his home). And in the never-dull French capital, where politicians have been known to air their laundry for all to see, Liesl Schillinger spins a true-life tale of sex, lies and presidents truly befitting the City of Light. Elsewhere, Cathy Horyn assesses the promise and perils of a post-trend fashion world; a pair of authors and a visual artist spill secrets from their diaries; a writer with a rare skin condition that keeps her isolated from the outside world sheds light on her life in the darkness; the talented and at-times controversial French-Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan sets his sights on Hollywood; and the prolific makeup artist Pat McGrath gets a close-up of her own in By the Numbers.

Mr. Rezaian was formally charged in January, even though the judiciary has not disclosed any details. His mother, Mary Rezaian, said that under Iranian law, Mr. Rezaian should be put on trial by early March, within 60 days after formal charges are set. But now, she said, “there are rumblings” that her son’s case will not be heard until after the Persian New Year holiday, which falls on March 21 and lasts for about two weeks, “so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6.” Mrs. Rezaian, an American who lives in Turkey, made the assertions in a written commentary posted on CNN’s website. American officials and The Post have repeatedly called on Iran to release Mr. Rezaian, 38, a dual Iranian-American citizen.

The auction house Christie’s announced last week that the original working manuscript and typed drafts to the song — 16 pages total — would be auctioned on April 7 in New York. Mr. McLean, 69, told Reuters he decided to sell the documents on a whim. Other than admitting that a line in the song, “the day the music died,” refers to the Feb. 3, 1959, deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. Richardson, known as the Big Bopper, Mr. McLean has been mostly vague about the meaning of other parts of the song. He told Reuters that the “writing and lyrics will divulge everything there is to divulge.” “American Pie” was released in 1971.

2015-02-17,Review: Berlin Philharmonic Goes to London in Simon Rattle Homecoming,"LONDON — Whenever the conductor Simon Rattle takes his Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra to London, there’s a sense of reckoning: about the boy who went away, made good and is now bringing home the proof. For British audiences, the very idea that a conductor from England — what Germans used to call “the land without music” — is in charge of Germany’s flagship orchestra is a continuing source of national delight. British music lovers are always curious to know how the relationship has worked out.

2015-02-17,"A Bold, Punky Lip at 3.1 Phillip Lim","It’s unquestionable (and understandable) that designers have lately preferred to keep their beauty looks simple, and the choice to eschew that effortless style in favor of a bold one feels innovative and inspired. During a season that’s so far been filled with natural-looking lips, it’s refreshing to see a color speak for itself, as we did at 3.1 Phillip Lim’s fall 2015 show today. Backstage, the makeup artist Francelle Daly professed her love affair with Nars Cosmetics’ newest lip color, VIP Red, taking us down a nostalgic burgundy punk path. “I fell in love with this shade when they showed it to me,” Daly said. “I remember in the ’90s and late ’80s, it was all about my red leather Dr. Martens boots.” The oxblood red lipstick is also the perfect complement to the clothing Lim showed: “It really fits into all these beautiful gold, brown and green tones that you see in the collection,” Daly said.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/phillip-lim-fall-2015-beauty/

(ABC Family) MATILDA (1996) For every child who ever thought the world was unfair, there’s hope that, like Matilda (Mara Wilson), he or she may one day discover a way to even the score. In this film based on Roald Dahl’s novel, Matilda is a clever heroine born to a loathsome set of parents — played here by Danny DeVito, who also directed the film, and Rhea Perlman — who is sent to a school overseen by a monstrous woman who torments her students. But things begin to change when Matilda realizes that she can use her telekinetic powers to defend herself and her fellow underdogs. Though the film may be too twisted for very young children, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, the “sweet, self-possessed little heroine” is someone to admire: “Even when addressed by her father as ‘You lyin’ little earwig,’ Ms. Wilson’s poised Matilda never loses the quiet confidence that guarantees she will prevail.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

But the prime minister is not available, and instead an aide conducts a tour of the premises — up the famous staircase with portraits of previous occupants and into a grand state room.

Simmons), an intense, strict and frequently verbally abusive  teacher. The film’s editor, Tom Cross, worked closely with the director, Damien Chazelle, to shape the cuts.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/below-the-line-editing-whiplash/

2015-02-18,In Defense of Islam,"Consider this post a kind of complement, maybe, to my anti-anti-Crusades commentary of late. The big foreign policy piece that everyone is talking about this week, and deservedly, is Graeme Wood’s deep Atlantic dive into the religious premises underpinning the Islamic State’s vision and grand strategy. Wood’s argument is rich enough to defy easy summary, but his core point is that Western analysts tend to understate not only the essential religiosity of ISIS’s worldview, but the extent to which that worldview has substantial theological grounding. It isn’t just a few guys making up a cult out of random bits of scripture; its political-religious vision appeals precisely because it derives “from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.” And we ignore the coherence of those interpretations at our peril: The Islamic State’s “intellectual genealogy” is intensely relevant to its political strategy, and its theology “must be understood to be combatted.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/in-defense-of-islam/

2015-02-19,Paula Hayes Reimagines a Victorian Totem in Madison Square Park,"Paula Hayes can see into the future. “I’ve always been a bit witchy,” she squeals. It’s true: Hayes has been infusing her sculptures with a bit of history and magic since she began creating work back in the 1990s. But it wasn’t until her first show in 2004 with Salon 94, which represents her to this day, that it became clear the environmentally focused artist’s iconic medium, the round terrarium, would trickle down into critical mass. These days, retailers like Target unknowingly shill imitations of her work. Now that every twentysomething in Brooklyn (and their mothers elsewhere) own the little glass spheres that contain living plants, succulents and crystals, Hayes has moved on. “I’m contemplating in the realm of nature, but it has moved into sculptural form and illumination,” the 57-year-old says. On top of her terrariums, Hayes is internationally lauded as a landscape artist — even divining the backyards and terraces of the art world’s elite, including the gallerists Jeanne Rohatyn Greenberg (of Salon 94), David Zwirner and Marianne Boesky. For her next project, though, “I’m not using living plants,” Hayes says. “That’s a huge departure for my audience, the aspect of the botanical or horticultural, with more than 15 years in garden design,” Hayes continues.

But new cases have generally been increasing in Guinea and Sierra Leone in recent weeks, and Mr. Ban said that more than half of the newly infected people in those two countries had not been in contact with people known to have been infected. “This reminds us that setbacks can quickly follow apparent gains,” he said. Dr. David Nabarro, appointed by Mr. Ban to lead the United Nations anti-Ebola effort, also spoke to the General Assembly and expressed concern about unsafe burials of Ebola victims, considered a major source of new transmissions. He said an Ebola-infected corpse, not handled safely, could spread the virus to as many as 30 others. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/world/africa/ebola-risks-linger-officials-warn.html

Standing on a stage lit by gleaming chandeliers before an audience of Russia’s elite celebrities, the parodist Elena Vorobei sings to the tune of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” in a crude impersonation of Conchita Wurst, the Austrian drag queen who won the 2014 Eurovision song contest. Vorobei is dressed in a sparkling gown, winking cheekily, scratching at her bearded face and swishing her lustrous wig around. “I have a beard!” she belts. At one point she throws out a Hitler salute, a gesture that’s meant to evoke Austria, Conchita’s homeland. The camera pans the laughing audience, cutting for a moment to a well-known actor-singer-writer-bodybuilder and then to one of the show’s M.C.s, Russia’s pop king, the also-bearded Philipp Kirkorov (widely assumed to be gay). The men, who are almost all tanned, in sharply cut suits, grin with unconstrained glee. The bejeweled women wear tight, knowing smiles.

It had been more than two months since protesters first sat on that street in their raincoats, sleepless and worried that the military would soon arrive. The fear had now dissipated, and on this cool December evening, the atmosphere was raucous and festive. People filled the empty spaces between tents, spilling out of a metro stop and pouring over concrete barriers with the help of carefully constructed wooden steps. They lined up for free souvenirs — silk-screened T-shirts, leather necklaces, protest stickers — and gathered around microphones for open meetings. They threw glitter and snapped photographs. They sang along to pop songs crooned by a man called Bananaooyoo (now a protest icon whose signature color, like that of the protest itself, is yellow). Archivists removed pieces of artwork for safekeeping, and a few activists hung yellow banners: “We’ll be back.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution-isnt-over-yet.html

The genre’s operatic plotlines require high-volume, wet-cheeked waterworks, and Contreras, who recently played the lead in 162 episodes of “Corazón Indomable” (“Wild at Heart”), weeps on camera almost every day during production. “TV screens are small — people need to see that tear to feel the emotion,” the 28-year-old actor says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/how-to-cry-on-command.html

Conveniently, it’s just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America’s best bars.

Direct, viscerally affecting images with familiar subjects: huge rallies, impassioned speakers, people carrying placards (“I Am a Man”), dogs and fire hoses turned on innocent protesters. These photos, as well as the portraits of national leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, are explicit about the subject at hand. They tell us what is happening and make a case for why things must change. Our present moment, a time of vigorous demand for equal treatment, evokes those years of sadness and hope in black American life and renews the relevance of those photos. But there are other, less expected images from the civil rights years that are also worth thinking about: images that are forceful but less illustrative.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/a-true-picture-of-black-skin.html

2015-02-19,"My Dear, Dear, Dear Watson","Part of the Internet’s beauty is the space it affords people to take an idea and run with it . . . and run with it and run with it, until they end up miles away from where they started. Among a subset of online superfans of the BBC show “Sherlock,” solving mysteries is mere window dressing for the real story: one about unrequited love between Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman). This sort of wholesale invention, by viewers, of a romance between fictional characters who are not romantically linked on-screen is a form of something known as “shipping” (short for “relationship-ing,” the term can also refer to rooting for actual fictional couples). It is by no means limited to “Sherlock” — any form of pop culture, from “Scandal” to One Direction, is fair game — but that show has inspired vast and vivid fictional worlds, completely imagined by shippers who share screenshots, drawings and even entire books speculating about what a dalliance between Sherlock and Watson (or Johnlock, as it’s known) might look like. These fans wring meaning out of every lingering glance and anguished expression that crosses Cumberbatch’s impressively dimensioned face and superimpose their own dialogue atop these moments, amassing a trove of erotic imaginings that is in some respects more compelling than the canon, at least in the unpredictability of the plot twists. For example, one offshoot of Johnlock, known as Fawnlock, imagines Cumberbatch as an ethereal deer, complete with graceful antlers and a speckled coat — and of course his lover, Watson, cradled in his forelimbs.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/my-dear-dear-dear-watson.html

2015-02-19,What’s on TV Thursday,"8:30 P.M. (CBS) THE ODD COUPLE Matthew Perry stars as Oscar Madison, a slovenly sports radio host, and Thomas Lennon is Felix Unger, an avowed neat freak, in this remake of the ’70s Jack Klugman-Tony Randall sitcom about roommates struggling to survive their divorces. Wendell Pierce plays Oscar’s agent; Leslie Bibb lives in their building and is willing to date Oscar, but only for sex; and Lauren Graham is his ex-wife. “The new show updates the surface details without dissolving the central bond between the two friends,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “This is Mr. Perry’s third attempt at sitcom success after a decade on ‘Friends,’ and there is an uneasiness to his performance — in some scenes he looks startled, even frightened — that makes it hard to play off Mr. Lennon, who seems very comfortable as a nervous nelly. That chemistry could come with time, but even if the show flops, it’s an interesting experiment.” In “The Big Bang Theory,” leading in at 8, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) gets some startling news as the gang prepares to help Stuart (Kevin Sussman) celebrate the reopening of his comic book store. And in the finale of “Two and a Half Men,” at 9, rumor has it that Charlie Harper, the character played by Charlie Sheen, may still be alive.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Donatello (1386-1466), has come to New York, and it’s not at the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Frick Collection. It’s at the Museum of Biblical Art, a 10-year-old institution not noted for producing once-in-a-lifetime shows, and it’s a beautiful, soul-stirring exhibition. It’s also a terrific valedictory show, as the museum will be leaving its current location at the end of June because of the building’s recent sale by the American Bible Society. Where it may reopen is yet to be determined. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/arts/design/review-donatello-in-a-valedictory-show-at-the-museum-of-biblical-art.html

Last month, the artist received a 2014 U.S. State Department Medal of Arts; and this week, he prepares for his first museum retrospective, “A New Republic,” which will open at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday. Throughout his career, Wiley’s pieces have canonized the people they portray: Descendants from Africa, Haiti, Jamaica and elsewhere, depicted along with emblems of culture and identity. “My work, for a long time, has focused on the ideals that we celebrate in America and abroad,” he says. Many of his paintings outsource their influence from popular movements that predate the 19th century, like Flemish portraiture from the Northern Renaissance. But instead of using dark colors to create a sense of severity or authority, Wiley’s portraits explode with energy and color — particularly in their use of clothing, which occupies a central role in his work. “Fashion is fragile and fleeting,” he notes. “But it is also an indicator for the cultural and social appetites for a nation.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/kehinde-wiley-retrospective-brooklyn-museum/

2015-02-20,Lucy Skaer: ‘Sticks & Stones’ and ‘Random House’,"In two shows, the excellent British artist Lucy Skaer covers much ground in several mediums with uneven results. The repurposing and recycling of objects, images and forms — from other art, her own work, her life — are prominent in Ms. Skaer’s work, as with many artists today. The strategy yields outstanding results in the five related sculptures at Murray Guy. The tone is set by a low-lying sculpture: two thick, rough-edged slices of mahogany inlaid with smaller objects found around her studio — a tiny prototype, parts of other sculptures, a small lithography stone and an oblong blue ceramic tile. The piece, which evokes sculptures by Carl Andre and Bruce Nauman, is itself a prototype for the next four: an all-ceramic version; one in marble with touches of malachite; another in aluminum with gunmetal; and, finally, an all-wood version (including veneer). Together they form a stunning meditation on processes, materials and craft, on mutating details and textural contrasts, on looking, achieving an almost cosmic scope. I doubt each would seem quite so rich on its own.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/arts/design/lucy-skaer-sticks-stones-and-random-house.html

A small show at the Lehman College Art Gallery of 14 quilts by seven artists, all made since 1990, and an accompanying exhibition of photographs, offers an update.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/arts/design/gees-bend-quilts-in-2-shows-at-lehman-college.html

Then there are the narrow side streets and uninviting storefronts where the real treats lie: feasts that reward the adventuresome and often cost less than an appetizer anywhere else.

After parting the hair to the left, he divided it into several sections, saturating each one with Phyto Professional Wet Gel for a smooth, sleek texture. Pecis then used a blowdryer to add volume to the front of the hair before pulling it all into two ponytails, which he twisted together, pinning them up into a sleek, smooth variation on the elegant chignon.

Then, when he decided to write “good” books, he took the advice of his mentor, Colette — “Get rid of all the literature, and you’ve got it” — and spent the next five decades producing more than 200 serious novels, keeping meticulous accounts of his multitudinous foreign translations and film adaptations, and moving his family from the French countryside to Arizona, New England, Quebec and back to Europe again, even while finding time to enjoy three very French family meals each day, and to walk with his adored children in the local parks.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/books/review/the-case-of-georges-simenon.html

Then, from 2007 to 2014, he took on the even scarier role of Hank Moody, the wild-boy writer in “Californication” — surely the most debauched novelist to appear on television since Angela Lansbury’s Jessica Fletcher in “Murder, She Wrote.” But Lansbury never produced a novel of her own. Duchovny has done just that, and the book — “Holy Cow,” his debut — enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 16. It’s not necessarily the novel you’d expect from the man who played Hank Moody. The protagonist, Elsie Bovary, is a talking cow who sets out for India after she learns that cattle there are viewed as more than hamburger meat; along the way she’s joined by a pig determined to reach Israel (where pork is off the menu) and a turkey bound for Turkey (“That was really just a play on words,” Duchovny told the trade magazine Kirkus Reviews). But beneath the goofy plot, which The Huffington Post described, not wholly favorably, as “a mash-up between ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘Chicken Run,’ ” Duchovny is thinking seriously about environmentalism and animal rights. “It’s an attitude of brotherhood,” he told Kirkus, “not only with other human beings, but with all the animals on the planet. I think it’s because of climate change that everyone is coming around to the idea that this is the finite planet and there’s a lot of unnecessary pain and overconsumption on it and there are things around us that have feelings that we don’t normally ascribe to having feelings.

Willem Dafoe plays Peter Van Houten, the misanthropic author of Hazel’s favorite cancer story, who lectures the couple on the difference between fiction and reality; Sam Trammell and Laura Dern are Hazel’s stricken parents; and Nat Wolff is Gus’s slightly goofy wingman. “Though it is a tragic love story, it is also a perfect and irresistible fantasy,” A. O. Scott wrote of the film in The New York Times. “Hazel and Gus possess an absolute moral authority, an ability to assert the truth of their experience that few can share and many might covet.” He added, “The loudest weeping you hear — including your own — may arise not from grief or admiration, but from envy.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Simmons will win for best supporting actor as a music teacher from hell in “Whiplash.” In the best actress category, Julianne Moore is the front-runner for her portrait of a professor with early-onset Alzheimer’s in “Still Alice,” while Patricia Arquette, as a mother filmed across 12 years in “Boyhood,” is the favorite for supporting actress. And Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “Birdman” may squeak by in the best picture category, which is filled out by Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood,” a close contender; Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper”; Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel”; Morten Tyldum’s “The Imitation Game”; Ava DuVernay’s “Selma”; James Marsh’s “The Theory of Everything” and Damien Chazelle’s “Whiplash.” Mr. Iñárritu, Mr. Linklater, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Tyldum and Bennett Miller, for “Foxcatcher,” are also nominated for best director.

False lashes were then chopped into small, square sections and ironed (yes, actually ironed) flat before being layered onto the lower lashline just above the oblong for extra emphasis. The look was finished simply with a careful curl of the top lashes (for prettiness) and a generous dab of lip balm.

2015-02-23,What’s on TV Monday,"9 P.M. (HBO) CITIZENFOUR (2014) Laura Poitras had been working on a film about surveillance for two years when Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency whistle-blower, contacted her in January 2013, using the name “Citizenfour.” When Mr. Snowden let Ms. Poitras know that he would not conceal his identity as the source of information about N.S.A. surveillance, she persuaded him to let her film their encounter. This Oscar-nominated documentary chronicles the encounter in a Hong Kong hotel room of Ms. Poitras; Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who first wrote about Mr. Snowden’s revelations; and Mr. Snowden as he hands over classified documents that provide evidence of the N.S.A.’s invasion of privacy and copes with the resulting media storm. “Cinema, even in the service of journalism, is always more than reporting, and focusing on what Ms. Poitras’s film is about risks ignoring what it is,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It’s a tense and frightening thriller that blends the brisk globe-trotting of the ‘Bourne’ movies with the spooky, atmospheric effects of a Japanese horror film. And it is also a primal political fable for the digital age, a real-time tableau of the confrontation between the individual and the state.” He added: “Thinking about the issues Ms. Poitras raises can induce a kind of epistemological vertigo. What do we know about what is known about us? Who knows it? Can we trust them? These questions are terrifying, and so is ‘Citizenfour.’ ”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

The valley widens above Wickenburg, and much of the town lies upon lowlands close to the course of the stream, and it was almost certain that the vast body of water which rushed out of the reservoir had carried away many houses at that place. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Feb. 25, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/1890-arizonas-catastrophe/

Another is the muse for his new piece, the emerging downtown legend Juliana Huxtable, who as an artist in her own right will also contribute a series of photographic self-portraits to the show. Benson’s piece, titled “Juliana” (2015), is a hyper-realistic, life-size 3D print of the transgender beauty, the third in a series of figurative sculptures whose previous subjects were a nude man and clothed woman. Draped horizontally on a plinth with fingers pinched in a Cleopatran gesture, Huxtable was originally meant to be immortalized in one of her signature looks before Benson, apprehensively, asked her to pose nude. “I was nervous of what she might think of that,” he says, “so I sent her this intense email full of historical references.” And though she is without clothing, her personal style is retained in the braids Benson painstakingly drew in a digital drafting program and the green makeup spray-painted onto the statue’s skin. The artwork stands as a token of how virtuosity and virtuality come together in the digital age. “I want the sculpture to exist as a completely finished entity inside the computer,” Benson says. “The 3D model is its ultimate version and the print is the real-world manifestation of it.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/frank-benson-new-museum-triennial/

I had taken three of my kids with me, so I was a little distracted when we got out. All of our passports were in the backpack, as well as my laptop, where everything I have written in the last 20 years is stored. I never talk to taxi drivers, but this one had been so friendly that I ended up questioning him a little. At a red light he even took out a photograph of his children, which he showed me. When we got back to the hotel that afternoon, I asked the receptionist what we could do. He just shook his head and said I could forget about seeing my backpack again. This is New York, he said. But the driver was from Nepal, I objected. And he had two kids. I’m sorry, the receptionist said, I don’t think that will help much. But of course you can report it missing. At that point the doorman came over, he had overheard our conversation and said he knew some Nepalis, should he call them for me? So he did, and I met them outside the hotel a while later.

2015-02-25,Bear Extraordinaire,"In the annals of human-animal comradeship, there is nothing quite like the tale of a brown bear cub named Winnipeg, Winnie for short, the inspiration behind A. A. Milne’s “Winnie-the-Pooh.” She was bought for $20 by a Canadian soldier at the outset of World War I, sailed with him to England, then ended up living out her years at the London Zoo. There, a little boy named Christopher Robin took a shine to her, renaming his own stuffed bear Winnie and prompting his father to write the classic children’s books. As a new picture book by Sally M. Walker plays it, this is a “gee-whiz” kind of story, with one improbable, satisfying moment after another and little to no conflict. Jonathan D. Voss’s sweetly realistic, nostalgic watercolor illustrations go down easy as well, casting a benign glow even over scenes of army life during wartime. The little brown bear is adorable and affectionate, winning the heart of every human she comes into contact with, and her owner, Harry Colebourn, is a paragon of kind, virtuous, never-say-never manhood. Though Winnie earned her place in history accidentally, Walker’s storybook narration makes her legendary status seem well deserved, even preordained.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/books/review/winnie-by-sally-m-walker.html

It is a way of making our metaphors concrete, and it shades into myth in one direction, allegory in another. Once, many years ago, a French translator decided that my novel “Stardust” was an allegory, based on and around John Bunyan’s “The Pilgrim’s Progress” (it wasn’t), and somewhat loosely translated the book with footnotes to that effect. This has left me a little shy of talking about allegory, and very shy of ever mentioning “The Pilgrim’s Progress.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/books/review/kazuo-ishiguros-the-buried-giant.html

Like Ferretti’s new collection, the resulting coiffure has a flowing, classical quality that’s meant to enhance each ensemble. “It has a kind of purity to it, which is so Ferretti,” he said, “but it will have a slightly old-fashioned take which feels very right for this collection.” Palau also notes that the hairstyle hides the models’ ears, adding to its timeless appeal and giving it an “untouched” and “painterly” look.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/alberta-ferretti-fall-2015-beauty/

There won’t be any clouds of smoke, though. The pot law, approved by 70 percent of city voters last November, is so tightly restricted to home use that this social revolution may be largely invisible in the city at large.",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/marijuana-legalizationnot-the-drug-itselfsows-confusion-in-d-c/

All three works explore extreme contrasts of high and low, loud and soft, fast and slow, and such, as the composer explains in liner notes. But nothing can explain the cosmic allure, audacious inventiveness and gripping strangeness of Mr. Ruders’s ingenious music. This recording album brings together three recordings of the three works made over 17 years, conducted respectively by Oliver Knussen (with the Capricorn ensemble), Paul Mann and Scott Yoo (with the Odense Symphony Orchestra).

For the lips, she chose similarly muted hues: “a pale pink” and “a pale orange.” (She also noted that she used “a little bit of blush” over the lightly applied foundation to complete the look.) It was a stark contrast to the brand’s bold spring/summer 2015 look, which involved bleached eyebrows with striking cat-eye makeup. “It was very funny because last season was a nod to punk — and for Miu Miu we had bad girls,” she said, referring to her work with another Prada S.p.A.-owned label. “But this year it seems like they’re good girls.” And it’s true — the fall beauty look has a refinement that matches the ladylike air of the collection.

Heady, who speaks about sake with reverence — “it’s the drink of the gods” — has since returned as an apprentice for about six months each year during brewing season. “The brewers are wizards who use fermentation to bring rice to its highest purpose,” he says. Fittingly, the blend he brews there — with notes of cooked citrus and wet wool — is called A Zen Ai Koshu, or “Love.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/t-magazine/gordon-heady-sake.html

But, she added, as in all of Mr. Anderson’s films, “there’s a deep, pervasive melancholia here, too, a sense of regret evident in Mr. Bishop’s slouch (with his plaid pants, he is a walking John Cheever tragedy) and in the way Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look, and don’t look, at each other.

On April 18, 1906, the Pacific tectonic plate, which extends under the ocean from Japan to central California, darted northward about 20 feet in just under a minute; in San Francisco, buildings that were not shattered by the earthquake burned, and within two days, 80 percent of the city was gone. At the time, American companies and governments still bought insurance from the old British firms, and the payouts to San Francisco were enormous. As was standard practice, the insurers paid in gold, shipping $65 million worth of bars — an estimated 107 tons, representing 14 percent of all British gold reserves — to the Bay Area. Afraid that all that gold leaving its vaults would permanently impoverish the kingdom, the Bank of England doubled interest rates on British bonds. In response, so many wealthy Americans sent money to England that, a few months after the gold came west from London, $30 million in U.S. gold traveled east.

2015-02-27,1890: Cholera in Persia,"Rigorous measures are being taken by the Russian Government, says the St. Petersburg correspondent of the Times, to prevent the spread of cholera from Persia and Mesopotamia into the Trans- caucasus. The Official Messenger publishes a long account of the progress of the disease towards the Russian frontier, with the opinions of Russian Consuls. The Consul at Bagdad states that, in his opinion the cessation of the epidemic in Mesopotamia at the end of 1889 was only temporary, and that it will soon reappear. Various arrangements of a sanitary and preventive character are ready to be put into force on the frontiers of the first warning. All vessels from the infected countries will have to submit to ten days’ quarantine and disinfection at Batoum and Theodosia. All pilgrims and travelers from Persia and Turkey are to be sent on through Batoum and Baku, where they will undergo quarantine and have their luggage disinfected. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Feb. 28, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/1890-cholera-in-persia/

Books about the enemy are typical in times of war. What was atypical about “Ho” was its fawning tone: “In his lifetime,” Halberstam wrote, “Ho had not only liberated his own country . . . he had touched the culture and soul of his enemy.” It’s a pretty lousy biography by any measure, every page a basket of freshly picked cherries, but for many historians on the right it’s still viewed as traitorous rot — as if Ernie Pyle had written, in 1943, “Goebbels: A Celebration.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/books/review/elliot-ackermans-green-on-blue.html

His soon-to-be ex-wife, Diane, has left with all of her things, and Sunderson drinks a bottle of Canadian whisky. “This had gone on a couple of days and . . . a colleague had checked up and found him facedown and comatose on the floor of the unheated enclosed back porch after a 10-degree night.” Up until this point, Sunderson’s steady drinking has been recklessly celebratory in this whisky-soaked novel, the kind of soaking one expects from a divorced detective at the outset of his retirement. But when he blithely reveals that he spent a few days unconscious, all the previous pages are cast into a foggy doubt.

2015-02-27,Jorie Graham’s ‘From the New World’,"Writing about Jorie Graham at this point, seven books after she won the Pulitzer Prize for “The Dream of the Unified Field: Selected Poems 1974-1994,” means joining a cacophony of voices. Google her name and you will find her elders, her peers and those she has influenced (and she has influenced most poets younger than she is, and not just in English, whether they know it or not) making cases for and against the importance of her work. People have all sorts of reasons to love or hate her, and even love to hate her for reasons they sometimes can’t articulate. The most evident case for Graham’s importance is the volume of chatter eddying around her name. Tune all of that out and the deeper reasons for her lasting reputation grow louder. Graham’s great body of work, summarized in “From the New World,” her new career-spanning selected poems (one can understand why active poets resist the tombstone of a “collected” volume), has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing.

Her mother has “ransacked” her room and “thrown all her stuff out, thinking it was stolen. Well, it was stolen now.” Gwen, you see, is ­upset, so don’t start with Gwen — the joke being, of course, that Chapter 2 is starting with her.

It is not advisable to read Irvine Welsh’s 13th book, “The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins,” and snack simultaneously. Because Welsh, known for his gleeful depictions of the depraved degenerates who populate Scotland’s seediest hollows, has turned his attention to one of his adopted homes, Miami Beach, that “sun-drenched refuge for strutting grotesques and desperate narcissists.” This is not Welsh’s first Rollerblade around Florida; “Crime” followed a coke-addled Edinburgh detective along the same bright sidewalks. It is, however, his first to be narrated by two Americans. And not just any two Americans. Female ones. This is a man who once successfully narrated a portion of a novel from the point of view of a tapeworm. The question is, in assuming the perspectives of women, has he bitten off more than he can chew?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/books/review/irvine-welshs-the-sex-lives-of-siamese-twins.html

To live in your body after is another.” Which might be the simplest way to communicate the impact of Elisa Albert’s brilliant new novel. “After Birth” cuts open the body of literature on mothering, birth, feminism, female friendship, female hateship — whether academic treatise or poem or novel — and wrenches out something so new we barely recognize it.

2015-02-27,"‘Hell and Good Company,’ by Richard Rhodes","Is it possible to speak intelligently about supremely ideological political events from a standpoint that airily dismisses the supremely ideological politics? Richard Rhodes has put this question to a test by writing an aggressively anti-ideological history of one of the most extravagantly ideological events that has ever occurred, the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. The Spanish war broke out because, on one side, the radically leftist Socialist Party pushed the Republican government ever further to the left, and large parts of the labor movement pushed still more sharply leftward, unto the zones of collectivist and libertarian revolution — and because, on the ­opposite side, the national army and most of the Catholic Church and other parts of society veered sharply rightward, unto the nether regions of the fascist extreme. And, well, the two sides could not get along. Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin made their own specialized contributions. Three years of this and Generalissimo Francisco Franco became the caudillo of Spain, and wartime atrocities gave way to peacetime atrocities.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/books/review/hell-and-good-company-by-richard-rhodes.html

2015-02-27,Inside the List,"A Massive Wobble: “H Is for Hawk,” Helen Macdonald’s moving memoir about falconry and her father’s death, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Macdonald is hardly the first best-selling memoirist to combine nature and grief: In 2012, Roger Rosenblatt spent a couple of weeks on the extended list with the elegiac “Kayak Morning,” in which he paddles around a Long Island creek and reflects on the death of his 38-year-old daughter, while Cheryl Strayed’s “Wild,” about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail after her mother died, has logged more than two and a half years on the hardcover and paperback lists. (It’s currently No. 3 in paperback, after 100 weeks.) Still, Macdonald was unprepared for the kind of success her book has achieved — particularly in her native England, where it was published last year and has become something of a sensation. “It’s freaking me out a bit!” she told The Belfast Telegraph recently. “There was a moment about two weeks ago when I went to do a book talk. People were queuing up to get books signed, and some were incredibly nervous and had shaking hands. I was horrified! They didn’t see me as a person — they saw me as a place holder for being a ‘writer’ or ‘author’ or some figure that wasn’t really me. That threw me into a massive wobble!” Her experience, she said, “taught me that this relationship with what is technically very much a wild animal is a way of getting in touch with all sorts of elemental things. . . .

2015-03-02,What’s on TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (TCM) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet young man and Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother, in this adaptation of Mr. Maclean’s 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression — and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. “These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this visually stunning film, for which Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for best cinematography. “Between the novella’s well-known first sentence (‘In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing’) and its elegiac last line (‘I am haunted by waters’), ‘A River Runs Through It’ circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Maclean’s early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories.” She added: “It’s easy to recognize Robert Redford’s reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love. While the film is more lavish than Mr. Maclean’s story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.” The evening’s lineup, part of TCM’s “31 Days of Oscar,” continues with “A Few Good Men” (1992), at 10:30; “The English Patient” (1996), at 1 a.m.; and “The Fisher King” (1991), at 4.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Finally, Wind Blown 05 Dry Finishing Spray completed the coiffure and added some texture.

2015-03-02,"D. W. Griffith, A New Perspective ","Hollywood usually loves an anniversary, yet even in the centennial of “The Birth of a Nation,” theatrical screenings of this foundational movie that helped establish the industry are rare. It’s no secret why: D. W. Griffith’s three-hour blockbuster of the Civil War and Reconstruction, while a giant leap forward for cinema, is also art in service to racist propaganda, promoting the Ku Klux Klan as defenders of the South from predatory freed blacks.  ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/movies/d-w-griffith-a-new-perspective.html
2015-03-02,Six Clarinetists In a Circle,"The rigorous, even-toned Chicago clarinetist James Falzone takes the role of his instrument in the history of improvised music seriously — and also the practice of balancing tight composition with open improvisation, extending outward from jazz into European classical and devotional traditions. He doesn’t come to New York often, and he comes to Roulette this week with a special new group, the Renga Ensemble, playing from a careful, bracing, provocative album, “The Room Is” (Allos Documents). It’s a set of pieces written for six clarinetists in a circle, with no rhythm section; it was inspired by renga, a centuries-old Japanese form of collaborative poetry, with a protocol to weave together individual voices into a coherent whole. The musicians on the record, and in the concert on Wednesday, are high-powered improvisers: Aside from Mr. Falzone, there’s Ned Rothenberg, Ken Vandermark, Keefe Jackson, Jason Stein and Ben Goldberg. Within the design of the compositions, each will get his say. (8 p.m., 509 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, roulette.org.)
