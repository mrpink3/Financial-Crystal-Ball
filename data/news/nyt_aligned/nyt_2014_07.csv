The agent, Jesus Mesa Jr., shot Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on June 7, 2010, through a barbed wire border fence near El Paso. Mr. Mesa and the Obama administration argued that the agent could not be sued because constitutional protections did not apply since the youth was not in the United States. A three-judge panel of the court, in New Orleans, rejected that argument, saying the agent’s conduct was obviously unlawful, so he did not qualify for immunity.

The ban, which took effect three years ago, set French authorities on a collision course with conservative Muslims who said the wearing of such veils by women was an obligation of their faith. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, said Tuesday that the ban was a legitimate attempt to preserve the norms of France’s diverse society and that it did not infringe on Europe’s Convention on Human Rights. The court was ruling on a case brought by an unidentified Frenchwoman who said the law was discriminatory and violated her freedom of conscience. The 24-year-old woman, a college graduate, requested anonymity for fear of reprisals if her identity became known. France was the first country in Europe to enact such a ban, followed by Belgium.

(FX Movie Channel) THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) Brad Pitt received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benjamin Button, a man born in his 80s in 1918 New Orleans, who ages in reverse into the 21st century, in this adaptation of a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cate Blanchett, above with Mr. Pitt, is Daisy, the dancer who loves Benjamin at whatever stage he is in. And Taraji P. Henson, who was also nominated, is the nursing home caretaker who raises him when his father abandons him. From Fitzgerald’s “odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that the film “sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist’s condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

2014-07-03,Q. & A. | Maya Lin on Saving the Planet Through Art,"In 1981, Maya Lin first caught the world’s attention with her design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Three decades later, she is working on what she calls her “last memorial”: What is Missing?, a nonprofit that blends art and science to raise awareness about the ongoing loss of biodiversity and natural habitats. Man’s precarious relationship to nature is also at the center of Lin’s studio practice, where she uses the tools of a scientist — sonar resonance scans, satellite mapping — to create strikingly minimalist works. Her environmentally-minded site-specific projects, including “Pin River — Sandy,” a ghostly wall-sized installation that maps Hurricane Sandy’s flood plain using straight pins, are the subject of the exhibition “Platform: Maya Lin,” which opens this Friday at the Herzog & De Meuron-designed Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill, N.Y.

After Carpenter burst onto the West Coast literary scene in 1966, with his gritty first novel, “Hard Rain Falling” (reissued in 2009 by New York Review Books), he became an unofficial adviser to fellow Bay Area writers trying to ride Jack Kerouac’s coattails. Never a hippie celebrity like Richard Brautigan or a living legend like Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Carpenter was a straight man to the more illustrious neo-Beat and -Dada artists of the era. With his moon face, receding hairline, professional discipline and calm demeanor, he was a steadying antidote to the counterculture bedlam of the tumultuous 1960s and beyond.

2014-07-03,Independence Days,"Reviewing a debut novel titled “The Orchard Keeper,” in 1965, the New York Times critic Orville Prescott chastened its author for nearly submerging “his own talents beneath a flood of imitation.” That young author was Cormac McCarthy, and the influence whose weight Prescott saw him sagging beneath belonged to William Faulkner. Among the hand-me-down characteristics Prescott noted: “the wandering pronouns with no visible antecedents; the recondite vocabulary and coined words; the dense prose packed with elaborate figures of speech; the deliberate ambiguity, the hints and withheld information; the confusion in time and place; and the flashbacks that fail to shed much light into the intermittent gloom.” All of these factors, he concluded, made for an exasperating book. “But the wonder,” he pivoted, “is that in spite of them it is also an impressive book.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/books/review/smith-hendersons-fourth-of-july-creek.html

2014-07-03,Escape From L.A.,"Some dystopian novels, like Cormac ­McCarthy’s “The Road,” explore human relationships in dark, existential post-collapse scenarios, uninterested in either causes or solutions. Others engage with global warming head-on and imagine the possibilities beyond catastrophe, as in Margaret Atwood’s ultimately optimistic Madd­Addam trilogy. But there’s a middle path too — one exemplified by Edan Lepucki’s first novel, “California,” in which characters traverse a cross-section of mid-collapse landscape, framed by the gradual decline of civilization. This approach may seem too optimistic given dire news about melting icecaps and acidic oceans, but it does allow for a reading of the novel as satire, skewering the elements of modern life that have brought us to this tipping point.

With neighbors feuding over whether to lease drilling rights to companies accused of poisoning the environment, it’s no wonder that a crazy old recluse like Aubrey Dunigan would be testy with anyone he finds hanging around his decrepit farm.

The countries that send troops, mostly from South Asia and Africa, are currently paid an average of $1,210 per soldier per month, a rate that has not changed for about a decade. The payments will increase gradually over the next four years, according to an agreement that is expected to be approved by the United Nations General Assembly, to just over $1,400. The countries contributing troops had wanted a rate of more than $1,700, based on an estimate provided by the United Nations Secretariat. Countries that fund peacekeeping missions — the United States, Japan and France are the largest funders — called that demand unrealistic. The total peacekeeping budget has increased to $8.6 billion, a record, though as the United Nations points out, that is less than 1 percent of total military expenditures worldwide. Each country decides how much of the reimbursement rate goes to individual soldiers. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/world/un-peacekeepers-pay-dispute-is-resolved.html

2014-07-04,1939: Nazi Germany Unprepared for World War II,"BERLIN — Germany is faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles to real preparedness for war, according to the semi-annual economic review of the Reichskredit Gesellschaft, which was published here today. Just at a time when the entire world is studying the Reich’s economic position in an effort to determine its war potential, this mid- year report reveals there are still a number of monkey wrenches in the country’s war machinery. Germany apparently is still handicapped by a severe shortage of labor, food products and raw materials. The economic expert, who summarized the report, found that the labor shortage is one of the weakest spots in Germany’s militarized economy. Even with the present size of fine armed forces, there is a shortage of one million workers and the only apparent way to increase the number of industrial and building workers is to import more foreign labor and ‘‘comb out superfluous labor’’ in the retail trades. It is estimated that the country could get 450,000 laborers by the combing-out process. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 5, 1939.",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/1939-nazi-germany-unprepared-for-world-war-ii/

Morton was a middle class guy in Austin with no criminal record, and he came home from work one day to find his wife murdered–and himself a key suspect. He spent the next 25 years in prison for murdering her, partly because the authorities suppressed exculpatory evidence. It’s as harrowing a story as you can imagine, and it’s a good starting point for a discussion about what to do to improve the justice system. Three elements of an improvement would be, I think: 1.) an end to the disastrous mass incarceration experiment that began in the 1970’s; 2.) an improved network of mental health services, so that prisons and jails are no longer our default mental health system; 3.) improved treatment programs for addicts, so that a failed war on drugs no longer fills up prisons and jails.

Warships from both countries lurk in the distance, and from time to time, the Chinese send air force fighters into the rig’s vicinity to show they mean business.

2014-07-07,1914: America Sends a Million Dollars of Gold to Mexico,"EL PASO, Tex. — More than a million dollars of gold from big business sources in the eastern States alone have been poured into the Mexican rebel coffers during the last nine months. This is admitted by Constitutionalists of prominence. It is added that since the split between Generals Carranza and Villa much money has been withheld, and the rebel cause now faces serious embarrassment. The bitterness engendered by the clash of the two leaders has loosened tongues, and the facts are now known for the first time. The money has come here in single drafts for $50,000 at a time on two local banks transferring the funds. It is impossible to get documental proof, but it is believed that most of it has gone to the honest needs of warfare. So acute has become the need of more money that Senor Alberto Madero has hurried to New York to impress the capitalists alleged to be financing the revolution with the necessity of funds. General Villa is trying to raise money by concessions for the sale of dynamite and the exportation of cattle. The Pearson and Guggenheim lumbering and mining interests have been allowed to reopen. Unusual protection is being afforded the latter. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 7, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/1914-america-sends-a-million-dollars-of-gold-to-mexico/

The tweets, as well as expletive-laced reactions toward his firing, have been removed from his account but can be found online. In the news release, Patrick Reilly, a SiriusXM spokesman, called Mr. Cumia’s comments “abhorrent” and “wholly inconsistent” with the company’s values. Fans have taken to social media to express support of Mr. Cumia, some saying they’ve canceled their SiriusXM subscriptions. An online petition to reinstate him had reached nearly 7,000 signatures through early Sunday afternoon. The show’s other host, Greg Hughes, a.k.a. Opie, posted on Twitter that he was devastated and would meet with SiriusXM on Tuesday. The hosts have a history of trouble.

Now the man who turned the Beastie Boys and the Red Hot Chili Peppers into icons has tapped the Australian folk-blues sibling duo Angus and Julia Stone as his new protégés. “It’s few and far between that I hear something that really excites me,” says Rubin, who’s notorious for rarely speaking to the press. “I heard their music and it really moved me. They make the kind of songs that I can listen to over and over again for a long period of time. They have hypnotic, poetic depth.” What Rubin didn’t know when he contacted the pair — who started making music together in 2006 — was that not only did they have no plans to write any further songs at the time, but they flat-out weren’t getting along at all. “It was only when I reached out to them that they decided to get together to make the album we eventually made, and through that process had a family healing and are better friends today than they, I think, have ever been,” Rubin says. “None of this was intentional.

Harding served only briefly, from 1921 to 1923, before he died in office, but his administration has been widely regarded as visionless, ineffectual and corrupt. He slashed immigration quotas, appointed his cronies — one of whom, his secretary of the interior, accepted bribes from oil companies in what became known as the Teapot Dome scandal — and brought an end to the famously reform-minded eras of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Perhaps the best that can be said about Harding is that he seems to have been conscious of his defects. “I am not fit for this office and should never have been here,” he once conceded.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/magazine/letters-warren-g-harding.html

The painting, “Odalisque in Red Pants,” was recovered in 2012 by F.B.I. agents in Miami when they arrested two people and charged them with trying to sell the long-missing artwork. Officials do not know when it was stolen from the Contemporary Art Museum of Caracas, where it was part of the museum’s collection, because the thieves put up a fake version of the painting in its place — a ruse that was discovered in 2002. Photographs showed that the fake, which experts said was crudely executed, was in place at least as early as 2000. News of the painting’s recovery two years ago caused a stir in Venezuela, and officials on Monday made a show of bringing it home, with a live television broadcast from the Caracas airport. When it was recovered, American officials said the painting was worth $3 million. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/world/americas/venezuela-stolen-matisse-painting-returned.html

2014-07-08,A Victory for Same-Sex Unions," The marriages of gay men and lesbians who work for the United Nations Secretariat will be recognized by the organization if they have been wed in a jurisdiction where same-sex unions are legal, including New York. Previously, the secretariat, the body of employees who work under the secretary general, deferred to the laws of a staff member’s home country in classifying his or her marital status: Same-sex unions were recognized by the United Nations only if the employee’s home country deemed such marriages to be legal. The change, said the organization’s deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, reflects Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s support for “greater equality for all staff.” The new rule was announced in an internal staff bulletin, Mr. Haq said Monday. It expands the civil rights of gay and lesbian employees, even as many of the United Nations’ member states, including Uganda, whose foreign minister assumes the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly in September, crack down on their own gay and lesbian citizens.

The report, which calls for greater effort and funding to redress inadequate sanitation, measures the world’s progress on the so-called Millennium Development Goals intended to improve the health and well-being of the global poor. The report notes some advances: A greater number of children are living past their fifth birthday. As many girls as boys are enrolled in primary school. Extreme poverty has been halved since 1990. But about one in five people in the developing world still lives on less than $1.25 a day; about 25 percent of the world’s children suffer from stunted growth, reflecting the effects of chronic hunger; and nearly half of all pregnant women did not see a doctor during their pregnancy.

The collection’s pared-back sensibility was inspired by a now-defunct 1930s Le Corbusier apartment on the Champs Élysées. Like that apartment’s mash-up of design motifs — a gold baroque mirror that sat atop a modern outdoor fireplace, for example — Lagerfeld’s designs married the old and new. Case in point: this modern-silhouetted maxi dress with ornate gold embroidery. Paired with a coordinating messenger bag, it made for a standout look that lent fresh new meaning to the term “matchy-matchy.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/chanel-bag-matches-dress-at-couture-fall-winter-2014/

In “Tiny House Nation,” at 10, John Weisbarth and Zack Giffin tour ingenious small spaces — among them, a micro-apartment in New York City, a transformed caboose car in Montana and a mini-mobile home for taking road trips — while helping families construct their dream dwellings in no more than 300 square feet.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

It takes a disorienting look at the parallel universes on either side of the Iron Curtain, a “Twilight Zone”-like scenario where everything is the same — except that it’s different. “The similarity of objects from the East and West are pretty remarkable,” said Bill Ferehawk, who organized the show with Justinian Jampol, founder of the Wende Museum and Archive of the Cold War, and Sarah Lorenzen, the VDL House’s director. They use no labels, so unless visitors consult the iPads in the room, only clues like German phrases on coffee cans will hint at the décor’s origins.

Bankers claim “regulation has become too onerous in the wake of recent settlements over money laundering” connected to remittance transfers. But The Times believes “banks want out because they face dwindling profits from cash transfers. Over the last five years, there has been a successful global effort to lower remittance costs through greater transparency, better technology and other innovations.” If banks can’t profitably transmit remittances, “then other secure, low-cost options must be found.”",Opinion,https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/morning-views-32/

Nearby, Jennifer Nichols works with thin, bright acrylic, creating abstract tumults of transparent brushwork and, more recently, calmer arrangements of letterlike shapes.

A dozen of his limpid gouache renderings of Michigan houses, all masterly compositions of point, line and plane, show buildings broken into constituent walls, roofs, floors and columns. With a palette of photographic black, white and gray, accented in blues and reds, he created weightless abstractions; solids and voids intersect in optical puzzles. He brushed calligraphic proposals for the new streamlined building types of the Machine Age — gas and radio stations — with a fierce graphic energy. His radically angled photographs of America’s traffic jams, skyscrapers, fire escapes and power lines found their way into “Amerika,” the German architect Erich Mendelsohn’s photographic essay of American cityscapes. Letters from Theo van Doesburg, Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe authenticate his position as a peer.

2014-07-11,What’s on TV Friday,"8 P.M. (Starz) FROZEN (2013) Warm up your vocal cords. This Disney 3-D animated movie musical produced “Let It Go,” the Oscar-winning power anthem, written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, on seemingly every child’s (and quite a few adults’) lips since its release in November. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a handsome prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace atop a mountain, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. “Allegorically, ‘Frozen’ lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” “There are moments when you may feel that you are inside a giant crystal chandelier frosted with diamonds.” Josh Gad plays Olaf, the snowman sidekick (above, with Anna and Kristoff, voiced by Jonathan Groff) who would rather be a beach bunny, in this Oscar winner for best animated feature.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

The diorama, made of laser-cut acrylic and stretching out over 19 feet in length, is a riot of color and light: Every structure belonging to Quicken’s billionaire owner, Dan Gilbert, is topped in orange and illuminated from within, and Gilbert currently owns 60 of them, a lordly nine million square feet of real estate in all. He began picking up skyscrapers just three and a half years ago, one after another, paying as little as $8 a square foot. He bought five buildings surrounding Capitol Park, the seat of government when Michigan became a state in 1837. He snapped up the site of the old Hudson’s department store, where 12,000 employees catered to 100,000 customers daily in the 1950s. Many of Gilbert’s purchases are 20th-century architectural treasures, built when Detroit served as a hub of world industry. He bought a Daniel Burnham, a few Albert Kahns, a Minoru Yamasaki masterwork with a soaring glass atrium. “They’re like old-school sports cars,” said Dan Mullen, one of the executives who took over Quicken’s newly formed real estate arm. “These were buildings with so much character, so much history. They don’t exist anywhere else.

So far, the Obama administration, which has worked to maintain ties with the monarchy despite human rights concerns, has responded weakly.

2014-07-11,1964: Dance Marathon in Paris,"PARIS — The huge doors of firehouses throughout the city swung open this afternoon and thousands of Parisians invaded gaily decorated courtyards to start off the annual dance marathon coinciding with the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. By tomorrow evening, scores of competing “bals” will have sprung up at most of the major intersections and squares, and seemingly nearly all of Paris will be kicking high in a polka or weaving in a conga line. With a frenzy matching the revolutionary fervor in the streets on July 14, 1789, many will pursue the dancing until dawn on Tuesday. The hardiest then will rest briefly before hustling over to the Champs-Élysées for the annual military parade. Officially, July 14 has been celebrated as a national holiday only since 1880. The parliament then, it has been said, wanted to endow the Third Republic with a fête day comparable to those established under previous regimes. Although nearly a century had passed since the Revolution, strong but futile protests were delivered in parliament against the official glorification of a day associated with the parading of decapitated heads on spikes in the streets. Some of the rites marking that first official commemoration continue to be observed today. Others have been modified or have disappeared. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 13, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/1964-dance-marathon-in-paris/

He says the customers are curt and rude much of the time. “They treat you bad,” says Bella, a native of Nigeria who lives in the Bronx. “Not everybody. But when you try to deliver to them, some people are drunk. They act up. I say nothing. I just say, ‘Thank you, have a good day, bye.’ ” ﻿Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/magazine/12-food-orders-and-the-people-who-delivered-them.html

2014-07-11,1939: ‘Peace’ Raid Made Over France,"LONDON — More than 120 of the finest heavy and medium bombers of the British Royal Air Force participated today [July 11] in the most impressive and significant sham air raid yet staged in air-conscious Europe. Taking off in succession this morning from their aerodrome in the English Midlands, the British planes pointed southward and “spread their wings” out over France. Never before had so many military planes of one country carried out an expedition of this character over the territory of another. The only information given the squadron commanders before they left the ground was that their destinations were “somewhere in France.” Sealed orders, when broken in the air, instructed the heavy bombers, totaling about eighty units, to make a round- trip, non-stop flight to Bordeaux, the French port on the Bay of Biscay, a two- way distance of nearly 1,200 miles. Similar orders provided a shorter flight for about forty medium bombers passing above the French cities of Le Treport, Orleans, and Le Mans, near Cherbourg. Their cruising radius is more restricted. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 12, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/1939-peace-raid-made-over-france/

Oh, no, that was my teenage daughter’s diary of her life in eighth grade last year. (Sorry for the joke, darling; I would never read your journal, really.) But in Weitz’s novel, those things do happen — save that the adults are all dead.

Picture books about ­potty training, tantrum throwing, the death of a pet and other emotionally charged topics proliferated, and were often shelved together at the library under the catchall heading of “bibliotherapy.” Some authors explored these concerns more artfully than others. Judith Viorst (“Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day”) and the late Charlotte Zolotow (“The Hating Book,” “William’s Doll”) proved to be masters of the genre, their dry-eyed wit, empathic touch and storytelling prowess easily a match for their good intentions.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/books/review/from-there-to-here-the-good-pie-party-and-bad-bye-good-bye.html

In the sweltering hospital waiting room, Devorah, dressed in a long wool skirt and tights for modesty’s sake, envies other girls sitting near by who are wearing shorts and tapping on cellphones, despite a sign forbidding their use. Devorah, 16, isn’t allowed a phone, because her family is part of the strict Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement. She used to admire how Rose, who had a “wild side,” read fashion magazines on the sly. Now, she laments how her sister has grown meek in marriage.

2014-07-11,School for a Scoundrel,"The name Seneca brings a particular image to mind: a gaunt, half-naked old man, glaring wildly, his veins open, his lifeblood seeping into the small bath beneath him after he was forced to commit suicide. Painted by Rubens, memorialized by Dante in his first circle of hell, gilded into medieval manuscripts alongside Plato and Aristotle, Seneca has come to represent the perils of proximity to absolute power. The central question of James Romm’s “Dying Every Day” is this: When we confront this tragic Roman wordsmith, tutor to the emperor Nero (and, some argue, the power behind that terrible throne), who stares back at us? Is it a tyrannodidaskalos, a tyrant-teacher? Is he the ultimate exemplar of Stoicism, a would-be philosopher king? Or is Seneca simply an accretion of history, a phantom constructed to fit our ravening for heroes, for antiheroes and for the sensational in the stories of antiquity?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/books/review/dying-every-day-by-james-romm.html

2014-07-11,Inside the List,"The Fur Flies: Comedy is like sex, or subatomic particles: The more you try to analyze it, the more elusive it becomes. So it’s probably futile to look too closely at Joan Rivers’s latest book, “Diary of a Mad Diva,” new at No. 7 on the hardcover nonfiction list. But what the heck. As its title suggests, the book is structured as a conventional diary that happens to be filled with the author’s brand of rapid-fire politically incorrect jokes — in the second entry, Rivers contrasts herself favorably with Anne Frank: “I’ve written six books, and Anne? She didn’t even complete her one.” Rivers is unavoidably outré — racist, sexist, raunchy, crass — which isn’t to everybody’s taste. (Another way comedy resembles sex, and maybe subatomic particles — I’m no scientist — is that different folks like different strokes.) But readers seem divided as to whether Rivers is truly meanspirited or whether it’s all a provocation, a persona she slips into as easily as the fur coat she’s wearing on her book’s cover. When the CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield suggested as much in a recent interview, noting that Rivers is a well-known animal rights advocate and wondering whether the fur was there just for its shock value, Rivers went ballistic. “Are you wearing leather shoes? Then shut up,” she said, before storming off the set. “I don’t want to hear this nonsense.” She didn’t seem to be joking.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The presidency has been largely a ceremonial post, but if Mr. Erdogan wins, as is widely expected, he is likely to try to expand the powers of the office. Mr. Erdogan has been the most powerful figure in Turkish politics for a decade. His opponents fear that if he is elected president, he will face no checks on the autocratic tendencies he has displayed in recent months while confronting challenges from street protests and a corruption inquiry. Speaking to more than two thousand supporters in Istanbul on Friday, Mr. Erdogan offered few details but vowed to expand democracy in Turkey if elected and to expand its role in international affairs.

The agency revised its funding appeal to $658 million from the original $371 million and warned that without urgent contributions, “the consequences could be drastic.” In another barometer of the worsening crisis, the charity Save the Children warned that a cholera outbreak that first appeared two months ago had spread, infecting more than 2,600 people and killing more than 60. Pete Walsh, Save the Children’s director in South Sudan, said in a statement that the country’s overstretched health service was plagued by widespread shortages of lifesaving supplies, as “desperate parents are coming to clinics with children who are already considerably weakened by the disease.”",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/world/africa/south-sudan-refugee-crisis-worsens.html

2014-07-14,1914: Brady Climbs The Mönch in Just Ten Hours,"LITTLE SCHEIDEGG, Switzerland – The ascent of the Mönch made on Saturday by Mr. J. H. Brady, of Baltimore, was accomplished in face of the most unfavorable conditions, and the route chosen on the northern side of the peak was one of the most difficult. The progress of Mr. Brady and the two Grindelwald guides, Christian and Peter Kaufmann, who accompanied him, could be observed nearly all the time through glasses from the Seiler Hotel, at Little Scheidegg. The party took ten hours to reach the summit. The ascent of the Mönch peak, although its altitude is not quite as great as that of the Jungfrau, is one of the most difficult climbs in the Bernese Oberland. From Little Scheidegg, at the foot of the Eiger — which with the Mönch and the Jungfrau forms the Interlaken group of peaks, of which the Mönch is the central one — the journey requires at least thirteen hours, with a stop for rest and sleep at the Guggi Hut, where climbers for the Mönch and the Jungfrau part company. The Mönch was first scaled by Dr. Porges, of Vienna, in 1857. Its altitude is 13,465 feet, and the climb from the Guggi requires between nine and ten hours. It cannot be undertaken by anyone but a most experienced climber, as the difficulties to be overcome are innumerable. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 14, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/1914-brady-climbs-the-monch-in-just-ten-hours/

2014-07-14,1939: England Bans Revengeful Wills,"LONDON – One of the foundations of English law — that a person of sound mind may will his property to whom he likes — was set aside today [July 13] by the inheritance family provision act which came into operation in the British Isles. The act provides for nullification by court order of revengeful wills in which husbands or wives cut off their widow or widowers and children with a contemptuous shilling or nothing at all, leaving them destitute while the money goes to charity, to persons outside the family or to some freakish cause. Testators are given self-defense, however, in a clause permitting them to append a side statement to their wills setting forth the reason for ignoring the dependants. The courts will take such a statement into consideration when dealing with a contested will. Those who may benefit under the act are limited to a widow or widower, unmarried daughters of any age, sons under twenty-one and sons or daughters who cannot earn their living because of mental or physical incapacity. If any such persons contest a will, a court will decide whether ‘‘reasonable provision’’ has been made. If not, the court may ‘‘tear up’’ the will and redistribute the assets of an estate. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 14, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/1939-england-bans-revengeful-wills/

Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) tries to scrape together a living smuggling cargo from one fringe of the universe to the next in this film written and directed by Joss Whedon. But the crew members’ off-the-radar existence is threatened when an agent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) of an oppressive government tracks them down, intent on killing a teenager aboard the ship (Summer Glau, above). Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis compared this science-fiction adventure with the “Star Wars” movies by George Lucas. “Scene for scene, ‘Serenity’ is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas’s recent screen entertainments,” she wrote. “Mr. Whedon isn’t aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

The court’s decision, which said that party members who had not been convicted of crimes should not be excluded from public life, appeared to pave the way for the rehabilitation of members of Egypt’s once-disgraced old guard. Mr. Mubarak’s National Democratic Party, which dominated politics for decades, was dissolved after his ouster. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that won successive elections after Mr. Mubarak’s fall, was swept from power during a military takeover of the government last year and banned as part of a crackdown on political opposition. Experts say a new election law is likely to further constrict Egypt’s political life, producing a legislature subservient to the new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while reviving some of the patronage networks that thrived under Mr. Mubarak.

P. Singh, in a case that drew international attention, prompted an outcry in India and led to the strengthening of sexual assault laws. The court on Monday stayed the executions of Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh; the executions of two other defendants were also stayed by the Supreme Court in March after appeals were filed. All four were convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death last September. The district court that convicted the men categorized the case, in which the victim was repeatedly assaulted with iron rods on a moving bus, as the “rarest of the rare,” a designation that allowed the application of the death penalty. The four defendants plan to continue their appeals, and a final hearing is scheduled for August, said Manohar Lal Sharma, a lawyer for two of the defendants. Another accused, a juvenile at the time of the crime, was sentenced to three years in prison, and a sixth hanged himself in his prison cell.

Its six guest bedrooms were then filled with pieces by Hauser & Wirth’s impressive lineup of artists, including Pipilotti Rist and Paul McCarthy, and the grounds were landscaped by none other than Piet Oudolf, the Dutch garden designer behind home-like public gardens such as the High Line in Manhattan.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/hauser-wirth-newest-outpost-somerset-opens/

2014-07-16,Introducing a Poet Who Works in 3-D,"The writer Alex Butler may live in brownstone Brooklyn, but that’s about the extent of her similarities to the young literary set. A licensed social worker, she has also worked for the designer Jane Mayle, served as a production assistant on the set of “Sex and the City” and recorded a series of humorous performance videos. It was the loss, in quick succession, of both her parents — and Butler’s experience as her mother’s caretaker during a harrowing illness — that spurred her to turn what had been a secret hobby into a career. But rather than sit down at a laptop and type about the experience, she began speaking words and dialogue into a Dictaphone — and later her computer’s camera — which led to not one, but two books: her debut memoir, “Walking the Night Road,” due out next year from Columbia University Press, and “Circling the Same,” a 41-poem meditation on loss. The latter — newly available online through its publisher, the Los Angeles–based gallery and art-book press Ohwow — is as much art object as literature: Butler’s words are printed alongside photographs from the artists Mirabelle Marden and Andrea Longacre-White. “Both of these artists’ work, and what I imagined were their intentions, reminded me of a world altered by grief,” she explains.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/alex-butler-a-poet-who-works-in-3-d/

Do the work. It’s a stay against paralysis, against the descent of dread. It’s less dramatic than “seize the day!” more affirming than “stop overthinking everything!” It is functional, and that’s what she’s trying to be. Do the work. She repeats it on airplanes, in taxis, on the long walks she takes to calm her nerves before a show. Sometimes she amends it to: Just do the work, the “just” a reminder that she’s not, after all, performing surgery on babies. There’s another, more refined version, too. Do your bits, she’ll tell herself, resigned to the idea that this may always be a struggle.

That goal is within reach.” In recent talks, Iran has shown flexibility on the main issue, “its future ability to enrich uranium that can be used to fuel nuclear power plants or, at higher levels of purity, nuclear bombs.” Its history of hiding its nuclear program has caused legitimate suspicions, and there are risks in any deal. “But there are many more if there is no deal — Iran’s program resumes unchecked and an opportunity to work with Iran on other regional challenges slips away.”",Opinion,https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/morning-views-37/

Ng’s men’s wear line AXS Folk Technology, which debuted two seasons ago, draws on the state’s pioneer spirit as well as the practical demands of communing with nature: “For me, the idea of quality comes from the sense that you can do anything in it,” Ng says, “that your clothes won’t break.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/axs-folk-technology-objects-without-meaning-los-angeles-brands/

The essay as a whole is an extended discussion of our current end-of-history era, engaged with some of the same questions as Mark Lilla, Steven Pinker, and other writers frequently discussed in this space. But its conclusion speaks directly to the moment’s foreign policy debates, offering critiques of both the anti-imperial left and the interventionist right, qualified sympathy for what McCarthy calls “anti-liberal anti-imperialists” (like his magazine’s founder, Pat Buchanan, and the late George Kennan, who are “among our greatest critics” but “preach what a liberal nation will not hear”), before coming around to a qualified endorsement of a “conservative realism” in the service of a liberal empire:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/the-challenges-of-empire/

2014-07-18,Staring at the Flame,"I reckon I spent five hours at most in Philip Seymour Hoffman’s close company, six at a pinch. Otherwise it was standing around with other people on the set of “A Most Wanted Man,” watching him on the monitor and afterward telling him he was great, or deciding better to keep your thoughts to yourself. I didn’t even do a lot of that: a couple of visits to the set, one silly walk-on part that required me to grow a disgusting beard, took all day and delivered a smudgy picture of somebody I was grateful not to recognize. There’s probably nobody more redundant in the film world than a writer of origin hanging around the set of his movie, as I’ve learned to my cost. Alec Guinness actually did me the favor of having me shown off the set of the BBC’s TV adaptation of “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.” All I was wanting to do was radiate my admiration, but Alec said my glare was too intense.

That shot, notable in an era of gross-out special effects marked by eruptive alien parasites and dramatic lycanthropic transformations (and originally placed in the movie’s opening scene), made the reputation of Mr. Cronenberg, the Canadian director, who was then 37. “Scanners” opened at the top of Variety’s box-office chart in January 1981.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/movies/homevideo/david-cronenbergs-scanners-in-a-blu-ray-dvd-edition.html

O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called “a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial.” Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecil’s close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. “In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf,” Mr. Scott wrote. “ ‘The Butler’ has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at each’s point of view.” He added: “We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

Almost as if these reports had not been broadcast Poland issued today a new warning to the Fuehrer. A semiofficial communiqué issued in Warsaw read: ‘‘Quite apart from the manner in which Germany may desire to incorporate Danzig in the Reich, Polish political quarters declare that the very fact of such an incorporation would constitute an inadmissible violation of the present political and juridical state of affairs and would evoke the appropriate response.’’ This response, if previous Polish declarations are to be trusted, would be in the form of the use of force by Warsaw to restore the status quo ante in the Free City. In a declaration in the House of Commons at the beginning of last week Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it clear that should Warsaw determine to resist an attempted change from within or without in the status of Danzig, Britain, backed by France, would come to its aid. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 19, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/1939-london-and-warsaw-skeptical/

2014-07-18,1964: Anti-Negro White Is Shot," ATLANTA — Restaurant owner Redell Crosby last night shot and critically wounded a 22-year-old white man who entered his integrated restaurant with other whites shouting that Negroes should leave. The shooting coincided with racial outbursts in other Southern cities, including St. Augustine, Fla., and Philadelphia, Miss. Police said five white men who entered Mr. Crosby’s drive-in restaurant were arrested and charged with assault in a scuffle that preceded the shooting. The victim of the shooting was identified as Maurice Lawson of Atlanta. Mr. Crosby was arrested and charged with wounding Mr. Lawson. He was released on $1,500 bond. Detective Tony Quave said Mr. Lawson and the five told the Negroes in the restaurant, “You just have to go.” Mr. Quave said the white men attacked two of the Negroes, punching one in the nose, before Mr. Crosby pulled his pistol. Mr. Crosby held his fire and ordered the white men to leave. All left except Mr. Lawson, who advanced on the restaurant owner with a beer bottle. Mr. Crosby then began shooting. A few blocks from Mr. Crosby’s restaurant, a white man and his son were wounded by blasts from a shotgun fired by Negroes from a passing car. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 19, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/1964-anti-negro-white-is-shot/

Since so many of the criticisms of the reformist tendency have focused on issues where there either isn’t a definite “reform” position or where our ideas are more modest and incremental than the received wisdom about what American conservatism “must” do, I’m concerned that my responses — whether on immigration, foreign policy, the culture war, or climate change — have contributed to the sense that reform conservatism somehow has an ambition problem … that it’s a plausible first step toward a new right-of-center agenda, but lacks (or hasn’t yet been gutsy enough to advance) the Big Ideas that conservatism really needs to matter in American policy debates again.

The school said it had grounds to expel the two who took the video, as outlined by the handbook given to all students: “Students may be disciplined for any other misconduct which is deemed by school authorities to be disruptive or to interfere with the educational process.” There seems to be no rule, however, explicitly banning filming and circulating a fight.

So is 13 a lucky number for Siddons? Maybe not, judging from the largely disappointed comments readers are posting online about “The Girls of August.” But Siddons has overcome negative reviews before. As a student at Auburn University in the late 1950s, she was fired from the campus newspaper for defying the administration with a scorching column in support of integration (an incident that later found its way into her novel “Heartbreak Hotel”). “Never write a column when you’re mad or sick or disgusted, or all three,” she proclaimed early in the offending essay. “These are the things that make bad little columnists get reprimanding letters from the intelligentsia. Only the greenest, foolhardiest, most naïve amateur would broach a forbidden subject in Enemy Territory. . . . Meet an amateur par excellence.” Later in the same column she mulled the word “tolerance” — “It’s a grown-up word. Children and mobs do much better with four-letter ones” — and criticized people who were content to let their “moral petticoats” drag in the “good old Southern mud.” Auburn finally did integrate in 1964, seven years after that column, and the school eventually forgave Siddons for her justified dudgeon. It awarded her an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1997, and organized a tribute to her last fall on the anniversary of the column’s publication date.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But two decades since that revolution began, she’s not impressed: “We are at risk of starving in the midst of plenty,” Taylor writes. “Free culture, like cheap food, incurs hidden costs.” Instead of serving as the great equalizer, the web has created an abhorrent cultural feudalism. The creative masses connect, create and labor, while Google, Facebook and Amazon collect the cash. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/the-peoples-platform-by-astra-taylor.html
2014-07-18,Viva la República,"There’s a certain sense of fatedness that emerges in the 13 espionage novels Alan Furst has written about Europe before and during World War II, even if it’s never quite enunciated in their wry, reticent storytelling. It has to do with the nature of the genre. Furst’s makeshift spies act with courage, but their choices are shaded with a brutal irony, darkened by what we readers, a few paces further along in history, know will be coming for them and the people they care about: the battlefields, the camps. The consolation Furst offers for this knowledge is present in a careful hedonism, which insists on the heightened beauty of the evanescent during wartime — the unexpected pleasure of a meal or a glass of wine, a night in bed with a stranger as it snows outside, anything human.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/midnight-in-europe-by-alan-furst.html

2014-07-18,A ’70s Childhood,"In his fourth book of poems, “Bicentennial,” Dan Chiasson is after beauty of a kind, so his poems are often beautiful, odd and quite moving. He seldom resorts to lilting cadences or glow-in-the-dark imagery to achieve this, and complicates any move toward traditional lyric warmth; his poetry is genially brainy, jokey, casually formal, sometimes essayistic and humorously oracular. Yet “Bicentennial” is no mere intellectual pleasure. It’s also a journey into a 1970s New England childhood haunted by a father Chiasson never knew.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/bicentennial-by-dan-chiasson.html

Rumsfeld square off in a battle of wits and words on topics including truth, power, torture and the Iraq war as Mr. Rumsfeld, above, reads aloud from a dozen or so of the most memorable memos — or “snowflakes,” as they were known at the Pentagon — he composed during his six-year tenure in the administration of George W. Bush. “Yes, it is a probing and unsettling inquiry into the recent political and military history of the United States, but it is also a bracing and invigorating philosophical skirmish,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The tension between those two registers — between hard facts about state violence and devilish abstractions about causes and consequences — is what gives the film some of its energy and suspense.” The film, he added, “is a cat-and-mouse game in which each player thinks he’s the cat, making it both thrilling and disconcerting to watch. It is also a nature documentary about behavior at the very top of the imperial food chain and a detective story about the search for a mystery that is hidden in plain sight.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

The violence, and demands from civil-rights leaders that the city act to protect the Negroes, prompted the mayor’s office today to order a study of complaints of police brutality.

After that, I put the ketchup through a food mill to achieve smoother texture, but that step is optional.

It aims to mobilize efforts to end female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriages. The study said child marriage remains widespread in parts of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. South Asia is home to almost half of all child brides worldwide, the study found. While an adolescent girl today is about a third less likely to be subjected to genital mutilation compared with 30 years ago because of activism, legislation and changing attitudes, Unicef said that in countries where it is still practiced, parents “continue to compel their daughters to undergo the procedure because of strong social pressure.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/world/asia/united-nations-study-tracks-millions-of-child-brides.html

The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office, in a statement carried by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency, said the officers had fabricated an investigation into a supposed terrorist group as a pretense to spy on top officials. More than 500 prominent figures have been illegally wiretapped since 2010, CNN Turk television reported, citing the prosecutors’ office. More than 100 officers have been charged with falsifying evidence, illegal wiretapping and espionage, and 67 were taken into custody in a 22-city security operation. Some of those who were detained were involved in a corruption inquiry that ensnared Mr. Erdogan’s close circle and forced four ministers to resign in December, news reports said. Mr. Erdogan has said the graft investigation was driven by people loyal to Fetullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and is a former ally who still has influence in various state institutions. Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels, called the arrests “the latest episode in the war waged against the Gulen community.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/turkey-officers-arrested-in-spy-case.html

Warns of Polio Risk in War Zones," The United Nations expressed concern about the possible spread of polio in the war-ravaged countries of Syria and Iraq and beyond on Tuesday despite the biggest vaccination campaign undertaken in the history of the Middle East. A report by the World Health Organization and Unicef said that 36 children had been paralyzed by the polio virus in Syria since the disease first reappeared there last October after a 14-year absence. Polio also has been detected in two Iraqi children in Baghdad, and it paralyzed one of them in April, the report said. Although 25 million children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated multiple times in seven Middle East countries under an emergency campaign, the report said many Syrian children missed out because of fighting and restrictions on distributing medical aid. The report said 765,000 Syrian children under 5 live in hard-to-reach areas. Polio, which is spread by feces, was thought to be nearly eradicated a few years ago, but it has spread in some fragile countries this year. In May, the W.H.O. declared a global health emergency because of the resurgence, imposing travel restrictions on Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon because the virus had spread from those countries to neighbors.

The ruling, which The Board calls “mindless and harmful,” seized on “poorly drafted” language in the Affordable Care Act to end subsidies in the states that opted not to set up a state health exchange and instead relied on the federal exchange. “It defies common sense to think that Congress really intended that there be no subsidies at all in 36 states,” The Board writes. For now, the outcome is unclear: A second federal appeals court panel ruled the opposite way just a few hours later and the Obama administration is expected to appeal the first decision. “Consumers are expected to retain their coverage and tax credits while this and similar suits in other jurisdictions wend their way through the court system.” In future decisions, The Board calls for “common sense in interpreting the law, not ideological opposition to Obamacare.”",Opinion,https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/morning-views-41/

2014-07-23,"Ghost Towns, Puffins and Unspoiled Views","Bruce Miller throttled back the engines of his 27-foot boat and entered the pinched harbor at Ireland’s Eye, an uninhabited, rock-rimmed island that lies eight miles off another, much larger island: Newfoundland. Scattered piles of weathered, gray boards dotted the steep, grassy banks like forgotten kindling. The captain held up a black-and-white 8-by-10 photo that echoed the view circa 1940. Back then, the timber stacks were clearly houses, schooners rested at anchor, and on the farthest hill stood a white church. Now, in the church’s place, a steeple lay in the tall grass. Worshipers last attended a service here in 1965, before a government resettlement policy forcibly moved the 157 residents of the remote fishing village, or “outport,” to larger communities in order to centralize the population.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/travel/ghost-towns-puffins-and-unspoiled-views.html

In May, the San Antonio thirty-year-old failed a random urine test administered by her parole officer, and in July, as punishment, she was sent back to jail before being released to house arrest.

The West German Red Cross said today that East German consulates were carrying on an active campaign in Poland to persuade persons of German extraction to move to East Germany. The campaign has thus far been unsuccessful. However, reports circulated in West Germany that Poland and East Germany were about to sign an agreement for the mass resettlement of 150,000 such persons. Those involved presumably would have no choice over their fate, according to these reports. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 24, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/1964-east-germany-seeks-germans-in-poland/

This five-CD album of choral works offers Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis” from the mid-1950s with the Philharmonia Orchestra and a 1947 Brahms “German Requiem” with the Vienna Philharmonic. Of special interest for me is the 1952 account of Bach’s Mass in B minor, with the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Singers of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and quite a quartet of vocal soloists: Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Marga Höffgen, Nicolai Gedda and Heinz Rehfuss. This recording, the one I grew up with, harkens to an earlier time of weighty, thick-textured Bach performances. Contrast Karajan’s opening “Kyrie,” which lasts 12:17 minutes, with Philippe Herreweghe’s 1996 account on period instruments, an undulant 9:29! Still, Karajan draws solemnity, depth and character from the score. A fascinating recording.

2014-07-24,The Maya Decorators Had It Tough,"Grain’s new line of decorative pillows was produced with Maya artisans in Guatemala — the country, as it happens, where the company’s now-married founders met eight years ago while students at Rhode Island School of Design. At that time, James and Chelsea Minola were introduced to the region’s fabric-making techniques, including the use of foot looms and indigenous-plant dyes, and they have been working with the makers ever since. “Colors can vary depending on the season and how much rain they’ve had,” Ms. Minola said, adding: “It’s a little nerve-racking from a designer’s point of view: You can’t match a Pantone chip and you can’t always get it exactly perfect.” This mildly erratic quality, however, is part of the charm of the five textiles in the new collection. The pillows come in two sizes: 16-inch square and 20-inch square, and range in price from $118 to $285.

If visitors were attracted to, say, a Shaker-inspired table or hammered-brass pendant light, and decided six months later that they wanted to buy it, how would they find that particular item? “We decided to make the process easy,” Mr. Miner said. In January they introduced WorkOf.com, a website that sells goods by some 60 makers in the New York area, such as Stefan Rurak, a Brooklynite whose Hephaestus chair, pictured ($1,500), is solid ash that has been torched then sealed with oil and trimmed in black leather.

They split up when she was 3, and her mother — herself the daughter of a dancer and a vaudeville performer — took Jenny and her sister to Van Nuys, in the San Fernando Valley, where she worked as a waitress and struggled to keep her family afloat. “We were on welfare,” Lewis said, before describing the day their fortunes changed, when an agent picked young Jenny out of a crowd at her preschool. “I think mostly because I was a redhead,” she said. “And I was a weird little kid, a weird little tomboy.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/the-jenny-lewis-experience.html

Most of the truly spectacular structures — like the Chrysler Building, with its aspirational steel spire — emerged in Midtown, previously a region of open rail yards and shabby industry. Beginning with the reconstruction of Park Avenue in the early 1920s, Midtown became a destination neighborhood for the city’s ultrarich, eager to abandon their stand-alone Fifth Avenue palaces in favor of contemporary “mansions in the sky.” Alongside the real estate boom came a decadent new night life and a host of more serious cultural diversions, all of them fueled, in Miller’s telling, by a steady supply of ambition, energy and illicit booze.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/supreme-city-by-donald-l-miller.html

It reads like a story by Graham Greene, Ian Fleming or John le Carré, all of whom make appearances, leavened by a dollop of P. G. Wodehouse. But, in fact, “A Spy Among Friends” is a solidly researched true story. The London journalist Ben Mac­intyre, who has written nine previous histories chronicling intrigue and skulduggery, takes a fresh look at the grandest espionage drama of our era. And like one of his raffish characters relaxing around the bar at White’s, that venerable clubhouse of England’s old boys’ network, he is able to play the role of an amusing raconteur who can cloak psychological and sociological insights with dry humor.

2014-07-25,Russia: 2 Activists Sent to Prison Colony," A Moscow court on Thursday convicted two prominent activists and sentenced them to four and a half years in a prison colony for their roles in organizing a protest a day before President Vladimir V. Putin’s inauguration in May 2012. The protest against Mr. Putin ended in violence between the police and demonstrators. A three-judge panel concluded that Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of the Left Front, had tried to organize “mass riots” in regions across Russia using money provided by a lawmaker from Georgia, with which Russia fought a war in 2008. The prosecutors’ case was partly based on information from a television special called “The Anatomy of a Revolution” that was broadcast on a state-funded television station. Mr. Udaltsov, the most prominent of 11 opposition activists sentenced to prison since the May 2012 protest, said the case was politically motivated. Mr. Udaltsov’s co-defendant, Leonid Razvozzhayev, accused Russian agents of kidnapping him while he was seeking asylum in Ukraine.

(Starz Cinema) WADJDA (2013) A rambunctious 10-year-old Saudi girl (Waad Mohammed, above) enters a Quran-reciting contest with a cash prize in the hope of buying the bicycle of her dreams — a mode of transportation discouraged for women, with which she intends to race a boy — and in the process overcome her reputation as a troublemaker. Heartbreak hovers over “Haifaa al-Mansour’s sharply observed, deceptively gentle film, reportedly the first feature ever directed by a Saudi woman,” with its “decorous, deliberate scenes” hinting at the difficulties facing her gender, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But “with impressive agility, ‘Wadjda’ finds room to maneuver between harsh realism and a more hopeful kind of storytelling. There is warmth as well as austerity in Wadjda’s world, kindness as well as cruelty, and the possibility, modestly sketched and ardently desired, of change.” (In Arabic, with English subtitles.) ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

It may sound at first suicidal on the part of this small country to seek to measure itself against the might of the Dual Monarchy. But the Servians don’t seem to have an atom of fear. Undoubtedly — and the opinion of all military experts who have seen them is the same — the officers and men of the Servian army constitute the best fighting material in Europe. I saw them, at the time of the first Balkan war — three divisions, or 60,000 men, march through Mustapha  Pasha, to the aid of the Bulgarians. Every man had already been in one, two or more actions. Everything one hears and sees leaves the impression that the Servians know what they are about, and that their lack of fear concerning their traditional enemies, the Austrians and Hungarians, is not without good reason. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 26, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/1914-servian-nation-to-resist-austria/

When Greenberg could no longer stand the provocations, which were echoed by an angry, roaring crowd, he confronted the third baseman and was rushed out of the park by local police for protection.

2014-07-25,Marlon’s Method,"The title of Susan L. Mizruchi’s Marlon Brando book is a hassle. You don’t want to be seen with anything called “Brando’s Smile.” You just don’t. I read the book the old-fashioned way — on paper. I read it in restaurants, on the subway and in the park. I read it with the front cover obscured. To dislike the title of the book is to reject its putative premise — that Brando wasn’t just a sexy slob with no technique but an extremely skilled, deeply intelligent, fiercely perceptive “public citizen” who “carefully controlled his smiles.” Mizruchi seems to be making a case that the modus operandi of one of the movies’ greatest performers can be reduced to the strategic concealment of dental work.

2014-07-25,Inside the List,"Private Lives: America’s most famous literary recluses are back in the spotlight. J. D. Salinger, who died in 2010, is the subject of Thomas Beller’s gentle New York-centric biography, “J. D. Salinger: The Escape Artist,” while Harper Lee turns up at the center of “The Mockingbird Next Door,” by the former Chicago Tribune reporter Marja Mills, new at No. 4 on the hardcover nonfiction list. There are a lot of superficial similarities between Salinger and Lee: Born seven years apart, both wrote beloved novels that have endured for decades as staples of high school reading lists — “The Catcher in the Rye” and “To Kill a Mockingbird,” as if you didn’t know — and both quit writing in the early 1960s to retreat into strictly enforced silences. But they probably never met for drinks, to judge from the portrait of Lee that emerges in “The Mockingbird Next Door.” Mills first met Lee and her sister on assignment for The Tribune, and eventually rented the house neighboring theirs in Monroeville, Ala., for a year and a half, during which she had ample time to observe Lee going about her ordinary daily life: eating at McDonald’s, feeding the town ducks, fishing with hot dogs as bait. Contrast those humble details with what we’ve learned over the years about the deeply eccentric Salinger, whose daughter claimed he sat in an orgone box and drank his own urine, and it becomes clear they don’t have much in common after all.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2014-07-25,Much Ado About Everything,"I once met a man with magic in his pocket. He was a former hairdresser named Maurice Ward, and the magic was a material he invented called Starlite. He said it was one of the most astonishing thermal barriers in the world and had been tested in high-profile labs, including a British atomic weapons facility, where it withstood several simulated nuclear flashes. Despite its dizzying potential — fireproof airplanes, laser-resistant tanks — Starlite never ventured far out of Ward’s pocket, because he refused to sell or reveal its recipe before his death a couple of years ago. I mention this because it still intrigues me, as a good mystery should, and because it was my first encounter with the head-­scratching, captivating possibilities of man-made materials.

2014-07-25,The Wealth of Ideas,"Before it became a political philosophy, liberalism was not that difficult to define: A person was liberal if generous, catholic in taste or even excessively rotund. Liberal people may not have been universally admired, but few took to castigating them as dangerous to the health of the state. The opposite of “liberal” was not “conservative” but “strict.” When Bassanio tells Portia in “The Merchant of Venice” that he will give her “the dearest ring in Venice,” she replies, “I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.” No one in Shakespeare’s audience would have concluded that the dissolute nobleman with whom she banters stood on the left side of the political spectrum.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/liberalism-by-edmund-fawcett.html
2014-07-25,Against Closure,"A while ago, on the planet of the novelists, two warring factions argued over whether or not characters had to be likable. Absolutely not, the frowny-face contingent claimed, arguing that one of literature’s goals is to illuminate the state of being human, in all its flawed glory. The smiley-face tribe took umbrage: What’s the matter with creating characters readers would like to have as friends? But maybe the question of liking or not liking is the easy one. The harder one, maybe, is what should we make of characters who never really allow us to know them? Characters who are in pain for reasons we understand and behave badly for reasons we can comprehend, but who inspire nothing as strong as liking or loathing. What happens when we close a book with neither a shudder nor a smile, but only a shrug?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/howard-normans-next-life-might-be-kinder.html
2014-07-25,Off the Reservation,"As I began Brando Skyhorse’s “Take This Man,” I thought, Ah, another New Agonist! New Agonists serve the kettle corn of memoir, candy you can’t put down. But often, at book’s end, there’s little to do except swap horrors: “Can you believe the part where Brando’s mama tries to drown him in the toilet?” “What about when she tries to put him up for adoption by placing an ad in a magazine?” And so on.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/take-this-man-by-brando-skyhorse.html
2014-07-25,Love Is Strange,"My inappropriate nickname for A. L. Kennedy is “Dr. Strangelove.” Not because she’s a devious former Nazi played by Peter Sellers in a movie of the same name, but because her work is obsessed with love and strangeness and, in this particular case, with the strangeness of love. There’s also a strangeness in her writing — both her premises and her sentences — that makes it tricky to situate this prolific Scottish author in any particular literary context. She does things her fellow widely prized and widely translated peers do not: compose whole novels in the second person, write BBC dramas, perform stand-up comedy and ponder in prose the existence of such items as a chocolate-flavored condom, as she does in her new collection of stories, “All the Rage.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/all-the-rage-by-a-l-kennedy.html
2014-07-25,World of Our Great-Grandfathers,"Back in the days when Jews could travel without having to go anywhere — one minute a house was in Poland, the next in Russia — they lived in places called shtetls, defined neither by physical size nor population, possessing mysterious features both urban and rural. Though Christians lived there too, the shtetl tilted spiritually toward Jerusalem, while performing economic services for the Slavic society to which it also belonged, giving it an Eastern European character all its own. Its amorphous nature has made it the subject of easy mythologizing, so that it often pops up in the American imagination as a kind of Jewish Brigadoon where all the villagers are singing, unless they are running from a pogrom.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/the-golden-age-shtetl-by-yohanan-petrovsky-shtern.html
2014-07-25,Insatiable Gaze,"Was Lucian Freud really a great painter? I’m not convinced. But he looms large in the social history of postwar London, an inimitable figure who crossed paths with everyone from Kate Moss to the Kray brothers. Born in Berlin in 1922, Freud was 10 when his family moved to London (well before his famous grandfather, who escaped Austria only in 1938). He showed precocious talent as a draftsman — and as a troublemaker. Quick with his fists, he was a chronic expellee. Eventually he ended up at a private art school in Essex run by Cedric Morris; when the school burned down one night, Freud took the credit. But he remained a protégé of Morris, one of a series of gay elders with whom the young Freud knew how to ingratiate himself — though he was conspicuously, not to say voraciously, heterosexual. His looks were as striking as his talent, despite Stephen Spender’s observation at the time that he resembled Harpo Marx.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/lucian-freud-by-phoebe-hoban.html
2014-07-25,"Was Warren Harding, In Fact, a Terrible President?","The many scandalous letters that Warren Harding wrote to his mistress, Carrie Phillips, which the Library of Congress is releasing on July 29, are deliciously fun to read. Written from 1910 to 1920, before Harding was elected president, the correspondence has helped inspire reassessments of his time in office. Harding is usually relegated to the bottom of presidential rankings. But he shouldn’t be, according to Vox’s Dylan Matthews and Slate’s Ronald and Allis Radosh. “Harding was hardly a great president,” Matthews writes, “but he doesn’t deserve the overwhelmingly negative reputation he’s developed.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/was-warren-harding-in-fact-a-terrible-president/
2014-07-25,Decline and Falling,"Ten floors up in a seedy apartment building on the edge of a city on the edge of a dry continent and a vast ocean, Tim Winton’s antihero teeters on the brink of destitution and despair. In the wake of several storms that have engulfed his life, he’s been left stranded, a fish flapping uselessly on the sand. Set, as so many of Winton’s books are, in Western Australia — “which was, you could say, like Texas. Only it was big” — his new novel, ­“Eyrie,” is a dark but dazzling study of people and places on the edge. These marginal zones are where Winton enjoys spending time, scavenging for driftwood, floats, rope, old sea boots — and characters like Tom Keely, a washed-up environmentalist who’s been unceremoniously ejected from the world of idealism and activism.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/books/review/tim-wintons-eyrie.html
2014-07-25,A Contender,"“So much precious time goes by and it seems to me I get so little out of it,” Elia Kazan wrote to John Steinbeck in 1955. “I ask myself is this it? Is this why? Is this what I wanted to do? Is this why I accumulated what dough I have. I feel like a highly publicized meal ticket, some of the time, doing what the hell my wife and family and society expects of me and not at all — since I dont think originally enough — what I’d like to do.

That post offered theological and sociological reasons to be skeptical of Kasper’s broad suggestion, offered in an interview with the editors of Commonweal, that Catholic marriage generally is in a crisis more severe even than divorce statistics would suggest, in which (he argued) possibly as many as half of all Catholic marriages are actually invalid. The second post, which I promised and then didn’t deliver, was supposed to be a detailed response to his specific proposal on communion, which he first presented in remarks to his fellow cardinals in the winter and then elaborated again in the Commonweal interview this spring.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/against-walter-kasper-ii/

2014-07-28,What’s On TV Saturday,"9 P.M. (Epix) THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (2013) A camera-ready Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, above) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) embark on their victory tour of the Panem districts as the Capitol prepares for the 75th games in this franchise’s second installment, directed by Francis Lawrence from the books by Suzanne Collins. But the champions aren’t safe yet: this new round of games pits past winners against one another in an ultimate death match. Donald Sutherland returns as President Snow, the target in Katniss’s sights; Liam Hemsworth is one of her love interests, Gale Hawthorne; Woody Harrelson is Haymitch Abernathy, the only living Hunger Games victor from District 12; and Elizabeth Banks is Effie Trinket, the tributes’ escort. “ ‘Catching Fire’ isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Boys (and men) are still boys, of course, including in movies, but the very existence of Katniss — who fights her own battles, and kisses and leaves the boys, only sometimes to save them — suggests cultural consumers are ready for change, even if most cultural producers remain foolishly stuck in the past. It’s unlikely Katniss will lead the real revolution the movies need, but a woman can dream.” The original “Hunger Games” (2012) leads in at 6:30.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Marks, general counsel of the Atomic Energy Commission, who said the Manhattan Project was a state unto itself that had ‘a peculiar sovereignty, one that could bring about the end, peacefully or violently, of all other sovereignties.’ ‘Manh(a)ttan’ provides a cleverly imagined portrait of the men and women who were at the epicenter of that peculiar sovereignty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

The measure, rushed through the House of Commons in record time last night, was given a hasty first reading by the House of Lords today. Earl Stanhope, First Lord of the Admiralty and leader of the Upper House, said the government wanted the bill passed by the Peers tomorrow, rather than wait until Monday. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 28, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/1939-britain-set-to-deport-all-suspects-in-i-r-a-blasts/

The kernels take on a beautiful color, and their sweetness contrasts nicely with the charred and picante flavors that run through this salsa. The corn also contributes crunch.

His combination of storytelling and hooks has earned comparisons to the hitmaking likes of Lorde and Frank Ocean, but a streak of naughty humor, often at the singer’s own expense, is uniquely his own. “That comes out of being Canadian,” he laughs. “There’s a reason why great comedians like Jim Carrey and Mike Myers came from Canada.

It is unclear whether Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has seen the letters. Mr. Hekmati, a former Marine from Flint, was arrested in 2011 while visiting relatives in Iran for the first time. He was tried and sentenced to death for espionage, but the verdict was overturned and he was later convicted of cooperation with a hostile government — the United States — and given a 10-year sentence. Iranian prosecutors have never explained the substance of their case, and Mr. Hekmati and his family have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing.

That is, until Jason’s mother (Loretta Devine), a postal worker with a chip on her shoulder, arrives from Brooklyn at the estate of Sabrina’s uptight parents. “Our family were never slaves,” says Mrs. Watson (Angela Bassett), who likes to converse in French. “We owned slaves.” Mayhem, of course, ensues as the film examines, among other subjects, class conflict among African-American families. Writing in The New York Times, A. O.

Terry Branstad, who is seeking his sixth term in November, is hoping to become the longest-serving governor in the nation’s history. And Christie — who referred to Branstad as a “dear friend,” a “legend” and someone who embodies “what public service is all about” — hoped to perpetuate his dynasty. In fact, he even offered to return to Iowa, over and over, “as often as Governor Branstad wants me to.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/magazine/what-is-chris-christie-doing-in-iowa.html

In particular, it’s been interesting to watch Ryan’s liberal critics train so much fire at his blueprint’s support (not as a universal requirement, as I understand it, but as a potential model for states to follow) for a contractual approach to anti-poverty spending, in which beneficiaries draw up customized life plans, set goals and targets, and have rewards and penalties pegged to their follow-through on those responsibilities. The liberal critiques of this idea, from writers like Annie Lowrey and Jamelle Bouie among many others, have been genuinely informative: I feel (sincerely!) like I have a better handle on the left-of-center view of poverty and anti-poverty policy than I did a week ago, and hopefully my future posts on the subject will profit from that advance in understanding.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/the-right-the-rich-and-reciprocity/

2014-07-31,Everyone Into the Kitchen,"In 1976, while Johnny Grey was still in architecture school, he cooked up a “punk Gothic” kitchen for a friend. It was the opening salvo in his war on cookie-cutter kitchens. With encouragement from his aunt, the renowned cookbook author and shopkeeper Elizabeth David, he designed what he calls “sociable kitchens” and promoted the principles that make them work. Today considered one of the world’s most influential kitchen experts, Mr. Grey, 63, estimates that he has produced more than 500 kitchens, and his company, in Hampshire, England, takes on about 20 projects a year. A recent example — a pool house with cooking capabilities in Cambridge, England — piqued our interest during these dog days of summer.

A young married couple, Frances and Michael, take a post-breakfast walk down lower Fifth Avenue that soon goes south metaphorically as well when she observes him checking out other women. They repair to a bar and knock back three glasses of brandy apiece while the husband, prodded by his wife, expounds on his greed for the bountiful “picnic” of female pulchritude on display in New York and she cries hopelessly. Seventy-five years after that story was first published in The New Yorker, a descendant of the Brevoort, where the couple lived, still stands. But their argument would probably play out not over Courvoisier but coffee with hearts etched into the foam on top, or complicated green juices. If Michael’s leers turned into actual overtures, he might be excoriated on Twitter for street harassment (#HollaBack); safer to examine his quarry on Tinder instead.

2014-07-31,Russia: Officials Deny Violating Treaty," Russia denied on Wednesday accusations by the United States that it had violated a significant arms control treaty by testing cruise missiles. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Washington of airing old grievances and using “megaphone diplomacy” to try to score political points during the Ukraine crisis. It said that problems stemming from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty were “not new” and that Russia also had concerns about American weapons tests, including of missile defense systems slated for deployment in Poland and Romania, as well as armed drones. The Russian statement did not refer directly to an American demand that it allow a delegation to visit Moscow immediately to discuss the United States’ concerns. But the Foreign Ministry said Washington had previously rebuffed Russian attempts to get an explanation about its questions.

2014-07-31,Libya: Benghazi March Protests Militias," Residents of the eastern city of Benghazi marched Wednesday in protest against Islamist militias, the city’s dominant force for years, in a burst of public fury a day after the Islamist fighters seized a local special forces base. Residents marched to a hospital, temporarily routing fighters from the extremist militia Ansar al-Shariah, who had been providing security for the hospital. But the militiamen fired on the civilians when they tried to approach the special forces base, scattering the demonstrations. Protesters said they were especially angered after the leader of Ansar al-Shariah declared Wednesday on the radio that Benghazi was an “Islamic emirate.” Violence in Libya has sharply escalated in recent weeks, in Benghazi and in the capital, Tripoli, where rival militias have been fighting for control of the international airport. Several countries have closed their diplomatic missions, and thousands of Libyans have fled to neighboring Tunisia in recent days.

2014-07-31,Immortal Beloved,"In the show “30 Rock,” there was a running joke about tragedy. A character appears, reveals her tearful past, then brightly adds, “They made a Lifetime movie about me” — the credential of an absurdly pathetic story with a redemptive payoff. Of all the great composers’ lives, Ludwig van Beethoven’s seems the most made for Lifetime. The curtain opens on a difficult childhood: an abusive alcoholic father, a boy genius mocked for his dark skin. He survives, makes his way to Vienna for fame and fortune — only to be stricken by (gasp) deafness. In addition, we have impossible passions for mysterious beloveds, side themes of class struggle, freedom, individuality, the backdrop of Napoleonic conquest and a score (what a score!) surging with alternating storminess and tenderness. Beethoven’s story is almost too good to be true, and almost too bad to be television. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/books/review/beethoven-by-jan-swafford.html
2014-07-31,Mr. Salinger’s Neighborhood,"“J. D. Salinger: The Escape Artist,” by Thomas Beller, is a story of echoes. In this short, sensitive and irresistible biography, echoes ricochet from Salinger to Beller and back, bouncing off a word, a phrase, an accent, a memory, a chat with an acquaintance. Beller grew up in Salinger’s far-reaching shadow, that cool, shady place so many kids have discovered in “The Catcher in the Rye”: the overwhelming relief of shared anxiety. He also grew up in New York. The sidewalks, the gravel paths of Central Park, the elevators and white-tiled bathrooms that figure so prominently in Salinger’s work are part of Beller’s vocabulary, too. He writes about New York in both his fiction and nonfiction with intimacy and patience and wonder. New York City is a unifying theme in “J. D. Salinger,” almost as much as Salinger’s life itself, almost as much as Salinger’s work. It is in New York, the fictional, literary city and the actual city, where the two writers truly meet.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/books/review/j-d-salinger-the-escape-artist-by-thomas-beller.html
2014-07-31,A Distant Mirror,"Next to the more apocalyptic spells of American history, the dismal span of 1973 to 1976 would seem a relative blip of national dyspepsia. A period that yielded the blandest of modern presidents, Gerald Ford — “a Ford, not a Lincoln,” as he circumspectly described himself — is not to be confused with cataclysmic eras like the Civil War, the Great Depression and the Vietnam ‘60s. The major mid-70s disruptions — the Watergate hearings and Richard Nixon’s abdication, Roe v. Wade, the frantic American evacuation of Saigon, stagflation, the dawn of the “energy crisis” (then a newly minted term) — were adulterated with a steady stream of manufactured crises and cheesy cultural phenomena. Americans suffered through the threat of killer bees, “Deep Throat,” the Symbionese Liberation Army, a national meat boycott, “The Exorcist,” Moonies and the punishing self-help racket est, to which a hustler named Werner Erhard (né Jack Rosenberg) attracted followers as diverse as the Yippie Jerry Rubin and the Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

Phoenix and Salt Lake City have already eliminated chronic homelessness among their veterans, and New Orleans is expected to do the same within six months, she said.
