Readers can then vote on the winner, who will receive a publishing contract and a $25,000 advance from Penguin.

2007-10-02,Paris Monopoly,"The principal discovery during the fashion break was the new bicycle system in Paris, whereby you can rent a bike for one euro (or an astonishing five euros for a week) and ride anywhere you like, leaving the bike at a stand when you’re finished. On Sunday morning, I picked up a bike near the Place Vendome, road to Avenue George V, journeyed on to the Left Bank, rode through the empty little streets of the 7th, stopped for something to eat at the Café de Flore, and continued to Notre Dame, where the Paris fire department had just put out a fire in an apartment building. I headed toward Les Halles, up to the Place de Victoire, and down to the Opera. Near Charvet, the shirt maker, I returned the bike to a stand. I had a thought in the afternoon, as I went over to the Rick Owens show at the Beaux-Arts, that you could almost do the collections on a bicycle, apart from the very distant or late-night ones, and wouldn’t it be funny to see a swarm of Yohji and Prada-clad editors wheeling their way to a show?

The charges against the American company, Armour Pharmaceutical, and the physicians in 2002 involved seven children in British Columbia who became infected with H.I.V. through a blood-clotting drug for hemophiliacs. The judge for the trial said he had found “no conduct that showed wanton and reckless disregard.”",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/world/americas/02briefs-blood.html

Also down on ABC compared with last year were “Brothers and Sisters” at 10 (13.3 million) and the two-hour premiere of “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” at 7 (11.7 million). Some of the year-to-year drop-off on these and other shows is attributed to increased DVR use, which Nielsen calculated has more than doubled since premiere week in 2006. Among adults 18 to 49, NBC finished a strong second with live “Sunday Night Football” coverage, followed by CBS and Fox, which tied for third. All of CBS’s programming on the night, a 90-minute edition of “60 Minutes” (12.8 million), featuring an interview with Justice Clarence Thomas, followed by “Cold Case” at 9 (13.6 million) and “Shark” at 10 (11.4 million), saw slight improvements over their season debut ratings a week ago.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/arts/television/02arts-HOUSEWIVESST_BRF.html

After a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, prosecutors decided that no individual officers would be charged in connection with the killing. The prosecutor for the trial, Clare Montgomery, described a “noisy and chaotic” operations room on the morning of July 22, a day after five men tried to detonate backpacks filled with explosives on the London transit system. “The police planned and carried out an operation that day so badly that the public were needlessly put at risk, and Jean Charles de Menezes was actually killed as a result,” she said.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/world/europe/02briefs-london.html

Shape, cutting, and special fabrics defined this collection, predominantly in vivid floral prints and in old-fashioned couture fabrics as well as high-tech synthetics like foam.

2007-10-03,East Coast Friars Win Legal Battle,"A long-running East Coast-West Coast Friars Club war has been won by the East Coast. Judge Otis D. Wright of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles ordered the Friars of Beverly Hills on Sept. 14 to stop using the Friars name by Oct. 15. The decision was a victory for the original Friars Club, a fraternal organization of entertainers founded in 1904 and situated in a six-story town house on East 55th Street in Manhattan. The New York Friars, a nonprofit organization, spent $300,000 in legal fees arguing that in 2004 after the pharmaceutical heir Darren Schaeffer bought the financially strapped West Coast outpost of the Friars Club, he transformed it from a nonprofit to a commercial operation and sought to exploit the Friars name. The Beverly Hills club, in a largely windowless building on Santa Monica Boulevard, was founded in 1947 by entertainers who had moved from New York. Its heyday was in the 1960s and ’70s when hosts like Dean Martin and Milton Berle presided over roasts attended by Frank Sinatra, Don Rickles, Fred Astaire, Bob Newhart and others. Membership dwindled through the 1980s and ’90s as the club fell into disrepair before Mr. Schaeffer’s efforts to rejuvenate its restaurant and attract private events. Contacted by phone yesterday, Mr. Schaeffer said he “wasn’t aware” that the club, where he invested around $10 million and was listed as chief executive, had permanently lost its right to the Friars name. Freddie Roman, dean of the Friars Club in New York, said the victory allowed the club to protect its name. “I feel very vindicated,” he said, adding that he was now focused on endeavors like the Oct. 19 roast of the comedian Pat Cooper at the New York Hilton, with Lisa Lampanelli as toastmistress.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/arts/03arts-EASTCOASTFRI_BRF.html

Earlier this year, however, the cancer returned and the strip chronicled Lisa’s health care decisions (including ending chemotherapy); how she told her 5-year-old daughter, and her efforts to lobby Congress for more cancer research money. “There have been a lot of people who think that comics should only be funny,” Mr. Batiuk said in a telephone interview. “But I’ve also been hearing from a lot of people who are in the middle of this, or know someone who is, and they appreciate seeing what they’re going through reflected in the strip.” Today will also bring the release of “Lisa’s Story: The Other Shoe,” a collection of the strips comprising this year’s story line and that of 1999. The royalties from sales of the book will benefit the Lisa’s Legacy Fund for Cancer Research and Education, established by Mr. Batiuk and the University Hospitals Ireland Cancer Center in Cleveland. “To think that some real world good might come out of this character is incredibly gratifying,” Mr. Batiuk said.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/books/04arts-COMICSTRIPDE_BRF.html

2007-10-08,Discrimination Suit Against Ballet Theater,"American Ballet Theater fired a trumpeter in its orchestra because it believed he was too old, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged in an age discrimination lawsuit. The musician, Henry Nowak, was let go in 2005 at age 74, says the suit, filed on Thursday in United States District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Nowak was a 28-year veteran of the orchestra and had never been criticized for his playing, the commission said. An unnamed conductor who helped to have Mr. Nowak dismissed, the complaint said, had asked another orchestra member for advice on how to persuade older players to retire and said of them, “It’s time to go.” The commission brought only 50 age discrimination lawsuits nationwide from October 2005 to September 2006 out of 16,548 complaints, a commission lawyer, Judy A. Keenan, said. “We believe that this was an egregious violation of the statute,” she said. Ms. Keenan said the commission had evidence of other cases in the Ballet Theater orchestra. A spokeswoman for the company, Kelly Ryan, declined to discuss Mr. Nowak, his status with the orchestra or the charges. “ABT is an equal opportunity employer,” Ms. Ryan said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/dance/06arts-DISCRIMINATI_BRF.html

2007-10-08,U.S.C.’s Stunning Loss the Latest in Season of Upsets,"Typical of a college football season where it seems as if the higher a team is ranked the better the chance is it will get beat, hapless Stanford stunned No. 2 Southern California, 24-23, in Los Angeles on Saturday night.   The victory will redefine the standard for an upset in college football in terms of the Vegas point spread, as Stanford entered the game as a 41-point underdog, according to The Associated Press.  The upset is indicative of the unpredictable tenor of this wild college football season, as this marks the second time in three weeks that that upset standard has been re-set, as Syracuse was a 36.5-point underdog at Louisville when it won there two weeks ago. And don't forget Appalachian State's shocking victory at Michigan to open the season.  One of the biggest story lines heading into the game was if U.S.C. Coach Pete Carroll would run up the score on Stanford as payback for a series of comments Stanford Coach Jim Harbaugh made this year to tweak Carroll.   Instead, Harbuagh's managed to get even further under Carroll's skin.   Coming into the game, the lone victory for Stanford (2-3) came against San Jose State, It was also playing without its starting quarterback, T.C. Ostrander. But the Cardinal backup Tavita Pritchard threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds remaining.   This will only increase the tension between Carroll and Harbaugh. The tiff started when Harbaugh openly speculated in The Los Angeles Times this spring that Carroll would be leaving U.S.C. after this season. (That caused Carroll to go on the defensive, as statements like that can damage recruiting.) Then, at Pac-10 media day, Harbaugh said that this U.S.C. team had was one of the best in the history of college football. Nothing ticks off a coach more than daunting praise.

2007-10-08,Inside the List,"‘THREE-ALARM EMERGENCY’: “The Best American Short Stories 2007” is new on the trade paperback list at No. 14. We excerpted Stephen King’s introduction on our back page last week — but also worth finding is David Foster Wallace’s blistering introduction to a companion volume, “The Best American Essays 2007.” “In your 2007 guest editor’s opinion,” he writes, “we are in a state of three-alarm emergency — ‘we’ basically meaning America as a polity and culture.” Explaining why this year’s volume has more political pieces than usual, Wallace writes: “It is totally possible that, prior to 2004 — when the re-election of George W. Bush rendered me, as part of the U.S. electorate, historically complicit in his administration’s policies and conduct — this B.A.E. Decide would have selected more memoirs or descriptive pieces on ferns and geese, some of which this year were quite lovely and fine.” About the lack of celebrity profiles in the book, Wallace says: “Some sort of personal quota was exceeded at around age 35. I now actually want to know less than I know about most celebrities.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/07tbr.html
2007-10-08,The Talk: Dream Weavers," Modernism has not been kind to curtains. Le Corbusier damned them, along with cushions and other props of bourgeois prosperity. Mies, on the other hand, was a tyrannical curtainmeister: in some of his Lake Shore Drive apartments, in Chicago, residents are still obliged to use a gray, white or silver material to shade their floor-to-ceiling windows. By the time minimalism rolled around, fabric was at its nadir. For the textile industry, it must have felt like peddling fountain pens in the dawn of the computer age. Of course, there have been talented fabric designers all along, but the net effect of modernism has been to reduce our idea of textiles to a sea of nubby beige tweed. Now that decoration is no longer Satan in satin, the challenge is how to reinvent the possibilities — and ultimately the perception — of fabric in a modern setting.

2007-10-08,Crisis on the Right,"Before there was a Heritage Foundation or a Federalist Society, or a Cato or Claremont or Discovery or Hudson or Manhattan Institute, there was the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Founded in 1953 to seed a new conservative generation (and originally called the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists), this pioneer of what would become a sprawling conservative counterestablishment boasted as its first president a young man named William F. Buckley Jr., who would go on to bigger things. As conservatism rose first to prominence and then to power, and as the conservative counterestablishment became an establishment in its own right, I.S.I. plugged along, mostly in the background. Today, as conservatism staggers through its worst crisis in a generation (or two), I.S.I. is still there — now asking what went wrong.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Rauch-t.html

He had shown himself to be a savvy political performer who would intersperse off-color jokes and prankish gimmicks among proclamations of a “revolution” that would wipe out the old political leadership — the “corruptocracy,” as he put it. Ignore all that, the ambassador’s line went. Despite the bluster, Chávez's actions would turn out to be fairly moderate.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Kurtz-Phelan-t.html

What wisdom do the great historian’s secret writings offer today? “That ambitious politicians will ignore the lessons of history if it suits them,” Dowd said in an e-mail message. “As Schlesinger told Al Gore during one of their mystical chats, when the historian was baffled at what Al was getting at, the lessons of history are ambiguous.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Upfront-t.html

The Mobile Art container, which is to roam the world from 2008 to 2010 bearing installations by 18 international artists. But the real showstopper is bound to be the container itself: a Zaha Hadid-designed U.F.O. made of gleaming-white fiberglass with a ring of interactive exhibition space inside. Lagerfeld dreamed up the project after a chance encounter with Hadid in the lobby of the Mercer Hotel in New York; impressed by the starchitect’s ability to detach herself from “the totalitarianism of the Bauhaus,” he hoped that together they could reinvent the notion of a gallery while creating a spectacle that would align Chanel with contemporary art and design. The project’s curator, Fabrice Bousteau, calls it “a research investment.” Lagerfeld has already deemed it money well spent: “We could have inundated the world with ads,” he said. “But it is a more noble project.” ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/style/tmagazine/07chanel.html

This is part of the continuing evolution of “mobile payment,” a phrase that can’t help but make you wonder what exactly was immobile about cash. One step in this evolution is an innovation introduced at Starbucks last week: the ability to automatically pay for and download to your laptop or iPhone the song playing in the background. This makes buying songs over iTunes — or any other online download service — look like a deeply premeditated act. It’s as if Joni Mitchell had instant wireless access to your ears and your wallet.

2007-10-08,The Oates Diaries,"In March 1978, Joyce Carol Oates experienced “flashes of lightheadedness,” which she put down to irregular eating. “But I can’t eat more than I do,” she told her journal; “it simply doesn’t attract me, I have no appetite.” To force herself “would not only be unpleasant but a waste of time. And I must admit I’m beginning to regret the time I waste eating. When I could be playing piano. Or writing. Or reading.” Almost two years on, the journal keeper, who often refers to “Joyce Carol Oates” in the third person, or to “JCO,” depicts the writer “working steadily for days. For days. A complete page-by-page revision of ‘Spider Monkey.’ And, yesterday and today, a play called ‘The Spoils.’ ... I could begin in the next five minutes on another play: ‘The Enchanted Isle,’ for instance. But I must try to rest.” And a question: “Am I in love?” Although Oates the diarist is a great poser of rhetorical questions (“What is art? All that we can’t be? Can’t control?”; “Do I differ from my colleagues at all? But how? In degree? In kind?”), this one gets an answer: she is “in love,” she supposes, but with “the products of the imagination.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Campbell-t.html

After all the madness of hospice nurses and morphine and final confessions, the relentless deathlike goings-on you’ve endured, life will snap back to a normal shape. Death is just a hiccup, a trick, a detour in your lives. Soon, the two of you will walk down the street to a bar, order a few drinks and complain about how uncomfortable the whole thing was, how absurd and overdramatic.

Spence writes in his beautiful new book, dreams of the “accidental discovery of a previously secret and hidden world” had long “lain at the very center of Chinese sensibility.” But Zhang’s imaginary wonderland was not a realm of peace and eternal peach-blossom spring; it was, instead, a secret library concealed in “a hermitage of rock”: “Shelves full of books are all around me. Opening the different volumes I take a look, and find the pages covered with writings in unknown scripts — tadpole traces, bird feet markings, twisted branches.

Unlike its namesake, “Transmorphers” has no recognizable actors, no merchandising tie-ins and a garbled sound mix.

Such topics appear to belong far from the halls of government. Yet Hass did serve, responsibly and diligently, as poet laureate from 1995 to 1997: he has remained visible ever since, writing newspaper columns, compiling popular anthologies, teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and keeping up his collaboration of decades with the Polish Nobel Prize-winner Czeslaw Milosz (who died in 2004) on translations of Milosz’s verse and prose. All that service seems to have strengthened Hass’s powers: this first book of poems since his term as laureate ended shows the worth of playing against type, the survival of his private talent and the artistic uses of his public life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Burt-t.html

2007-10-08,F.Y.I. | From Aalto to Zanuso.,"The book “Design: Intelligence Made Visible” (Firefly Books), by Stephen Bayley and Terence Conran, traces the development of design from the 18th century to the present, offering an alphabetical who’s who of pioneering manufacturers (like Fiat and I.B.M.) and designers (like Christopher Dresser and Carlo Mollino). Bayley, a consultant and critic who was the first director of the Design Museum in London, and Conran, the designer and retailer who also founded that museum, have assembled a lively and opinionated history. The bygone age of enlightened corporate sponsorship gets loving treatment. But design today? Not so much. The few contemporary designers who get their own entries include Apple’s Jonathan Ive, the car designer J Mays and Sir James Dyson of vacuum-cleaner fame. Philippe Starck gets one, too, but mainly as an illustration of what the authors call “the ‘designer’ phenomenon, or problem.” Doesn’t bode well for a Volume 2.

That status was conferred on the unsuspecting twenty-five-year-old, literally overnight, when he was the first aviator to fly without stopping from New York to Paris, a feat that many people-even many aviators-had thought impossible. Making Lindbergh's triumph all the more newsworthy was that he flew without a copilot, a radio, or even a front window for thirty-three and a half hours in a single-engine airplane made from wood, canvas, and piano wire. The New York Times showed its awe by devoting its first five pages to the dimple-chinned American's landing at Le Bourget, the dusty airfield where 100,000 Frenchmen-nearly all of them chanting ""Lan-Bairgh! Lan-Bairgh!""-were so eager to stare at the spent pilot that they almost trampled him to death after he climbed out of his cockpit.

2007-10-08,Paperback Row,"MY LIFE IN FRANCE, by Julia Child with Alex Prud’homme. (Anchor, $14.95.) This is a delightful account of how a “6-foot-2-inch, 36-year-old, rather loud and unserious Californian” became America’s grande dame of French cooking. Writing with Paul Child’s great-nephew, Julia recalls how she ate “the most exciting meal of my life” at a restaurant in Rouen on her first day in France in 1948, and where the road from Rouen led. Illustrated with 79 black-and-white photographs, many taken by Paul, the book “is really a love story,” Alan Riding said in the Book Review. Julia, who died at 91 in 2004, “loved Paul Child ... she loved France; she loved French cooking; and she loved life.” M. F. K. Fisher, who discovered French cooking 20 years before Julia, became one of America’s most stylish and sensual food writers before her death in 1992. A STEW OR A STORY: An Assortment of Short Works by M. F. K. Fisher, edited by Joan Reardon (Shoemaker & Hoard, $15.95), collects five decades’ worth of Fisher’s short magazine pieces. Although some are lackluster, our reviewer, Julia Reed, praised several entries, especially an autobiographical short story. “Lovers of Fisher should have ‘A Stew or a Story’ on their shelves for those pieces alone,” Reed wrote.

In full gunslinger mode, Romo was dreadful for all but the last four minutes, but he still managed to lead a game-winning drive when it mattered. The real star was kicker Nick Folk, who had to make a 53-yard field goal (his longest ever) twice to win the game because Bills Coach Dick Jauron called timeout right before the snap. The folks at AOL Fan House are calling for an end to that strategy, which has been used at the end of at least two other games this season.

2007-10-10,Celebrating Classic Japanese Cars,"A 1967 Mazda Cosmo Sport. (Photo by Koji Yamaguchi/Japanese Classic Car Show Association) More PhotosRecently I wrote about Brian Baker, an authority on the Honda S600 and S800 models, though his Honda expertise extends far beyond those little roadsters. Last weekend, Mr. Baker flew to California to attend the third Japanese Classic Car Show in Long Beach as a guest of Jay Leno.  As I wrote in the article, Mr. Leno had bought a Honda S600 a few months ago and hired Mr. Baker to help him obtain parts for the restoration, as well as to offer some technical advice. Mr. Leno was hoping to have the car finished in time for the car show.  That didn't happen. Instead, Mr. Leno drove his Mazda Cosmo Sport 110 to the event, which was held at the Queen Mary Event Park in Long Beach. According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Leno acquired the Cosmo, which was produced from 1967 to 1972 and never imported to the United States, two years ago.  All of the cars at the Japanese Classic Car Show were pre-1985. Many of them, like Jay Leno's Cosmo and the Nissan Skyline, were never sold in America. Organizers told me that more than 350 cars were registered. I can believe it.  A 1969 Toyota Corolla was among hundreds on display in Long Beach. (Photo by Koji Yamaguchi/Japanese Classic Car Show Association) More Photos  The popularity of vintage Japanese cars has been growing over the past few years. I first noticed it around 2000, while I was the editor of an import tuning magazine in Los Angeles. During that time, I met a few middle-age shop owners who had their own stashes of older Japanese cars, mostly Datsun 240Zs, Datsun 510s, and Toyota Corollas. Since then, interest has spread beyond people who grew up with the cars to every age group.  There are Web sites, like Japanese Nostalgic Car, dedicated to vintage Japanese cars. Benjamin Hsu, who founded the site with his brother Dan, is 31. Dan is 25.   Mr. Hsu said that the trend is growing.   ""There are people who you would not expect to be into vintage Japanese cars,"" he said.  ""We were driving back from the Motoring J-Style show in the Bay Area to where we were staying in San Jose, and we drove past a 1977 Toyota Corona station wagon, slammed on Hayashi wheels,"" he said, referring to classic Japanese racing wheels produced in the 1970s.  ""We followed him for a while, until he stopped to meet up with another car, an '82 Corolla,"" Mr. Hsu said. ""We stopped to talk to them -- and they were 16-year-old kids. They had no idea there was a car show for classic Japanese cars 40 minutes away.""  This was the first year for Motoring J-Style, a Japanese car show organized by Martin Swig and his son, David. Martin Swig is known for his collection of vintage Alfa Romeos and for organizing vintage car rallies like the California Mille. And as a sign of the increasing value of Japanese vintage cars, the Motoring J-Style Web site offers regular market reports on prices of vintage Japanese car sales.  According to the Wall Street Journal article, Mazda USA recently purchased a Cosmo 110 for about $40,000, which Mr. Leno said was money well spent. ""The one thing the Europeans always had was heritage,"" he said. ""Now, for the first time, the Japanese have heritage.""  Need more proof?

The trial, which comes days after intruders broke into the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and punched a hole in a painting by Claude Monet, concerns Rindy Sam, a 30-year-old artist who was arrested in July after kissing the Twombly work at an exhibition in Avignon, France. “I just gave it a kiss,” Ms. Sam told the court, which was shown a reproduction, above, of the lipstick mark. “It was an act of love; when I kissed it, I wasn’t thinking. I thought the artist would understand.” The prosecution demanded a fine of 4,500 euros ($6,300) and a civics course as punishment for what it called a form of cannibalism, though it said the young woman “clearly does not realize what she has done.” Mr. Twombly’s untitled work, measuring about nine by six feet, is valued at almost $3 million. A verdict is expected in a few weeks.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/arts/design/10arts-AKISSISJUSTA_BRF.html

2007-10-10,'Grand Central',"While commuting from Manhattan to an upstate New York teaching job, I got to experience the vigor of morning rush hour in Grand Central Terminal. I found the flow of people hypnotic.  VideoIt's like an epic ballet with a cast of thousands -- most of them oblivious to the grandeur of the event, focused on navigating their way to somewhere else.   My commute happily coincided with the morning sun streaming into the station through the east window. Each week, I shot a two-minute roll of film before rushing off to catch my train. Most of the film was shot with a 75-year-old 16 mm Bell and Howell Filmo, which was one of the first home movie cameras ever mass-marketed. There is a lot of this beautiful old camera's personality in this film. I used black-and-white because Grand Central is always black-and-white in my mind. This particular film has a very low sensitivity to light (A.S.A. 6) and is very contrast-y. The only way to make an exposure was to literally shoot the pools of window light. As people move through the light, it's almost as if they are sculpting it with their passing silhouettes.   The wonderfully dramatic music is by Shay Lynch.

Take a look at Michael Schumacher’s treatment at Ferrari and it is easy to see that the same concept of equality was never something that Ferrari particularly worried about. (Whether they were right or wrong is irrelevant, as is whether Schumacher deserved this or not. It could be argued that Schumacher was just so much better than most of his teammates that the team felt obliged to help him on a down day, knowing he would deliver in the end.) My point is that it is simply clear that Ferrari supported Schumacher over his teammates and did not worry about the concept of equality, whereas McLaren – which is being accused here and there of not treating both teammates equally – DOES value equality.",World,https://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/a-question-of-f1-equality/

Mr. Sutherland, left, the Emmy Award-winning actor who portrays Agent Jack Bauer on the Fox hit “24,” is likely to serve at least a month in the Los Angeles County jail after pleading no contest on Tuesday to a misdemeanor charge of drunken driving. Mr. Sutherland, 40, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 21 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The Los Angeles city attorney’s office recommended that he serve 30 days for the charge and another 18 for violating his probation for a 2004 drunken-driving incident. The most recent charge was his fourth related to alcohol since 1989. The city attorney also recommended that Mr. Sutherland be given five years’ probation, complete an 18-month alcohol education program and be prohibited from driving until at least May 9. A judge could decide not to accept the city attorney’s recommendation and sentence Mr. Sutherland to up to a year in jail. Fox Broadcasting and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying that production of the new season of “24,” already under way, “will not be adversely impacted.” The season is scheduled to begin in January, and Fox said it expected production to be completed in May as planned. In a separate statement, Mr. Sutherland apologized. “I’m very disappointed in myself for the poor judgment I exhibited recently, and I’m deeply sorry for the disappointment and distress this has caused my family, friends and co-workers on ‘24’ and at 20th Century Fox,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/arts/television/11arts-JAILLOOMSFOR_BRF.html

Kurtz, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, called 911 to report that his wife was not breathing. When the police arrived at their home, they found Mrs. Kurtz dead and discovered materials for a biologically based art exhibition. Medical examiners later determined that her death was not suspicious; she died of heart failure. But the federal government, arguing that public safety issues were involved, indicted Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Ferrell. The case has drawn widespread criticism from the art community and civil libertarians and is the subject of a recently released movie, “Strange Culture.” Mr. Ferrell has been ill with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and has suffered two strokes. In a statement, his daughter, Gentry Chandler Ferrell, said he had agreed to the plea in part because of health concerns.

One of the most pointed criticisms of Ms. Lessing came from Harold Bloom, the Yale professor and literary critic, who told The Associated Press, “Although Ms. Lessing at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities, I find her work for the past 15 years quite unreadable.” He went on to add that the prize is “pure political correctness.” Interestingly, Ms. Lessing had some strong thoughts about political correctness, thoughts she expressed in this adapted article, which appeared on the Op-Ed page on June 26, 1992.

Called Dia:Beacon, it houses a fabulous collection of contemporary art: massive torqued sculptures by Richard Serra, minimalist boxes by Donald Judd, string sculptures by Fred Sandback. A gallery the size of a football field is devoted to the iconic fluorescent-light sculptures of Dan Flavin; another gallery, every bit as large, displays 15 equally iconic scrap-metal sculptures by John Chamberlain. A single Andy Warhol wraps around all four walls of one big room. Twenty-five artists, almost all of them people who in the ’60s and ’70s helped to create the language of contemporary art, take up the entirety of Dia:Beacon. The art represents the permanent collection of the New York City-based Dia Art Foundation.

2007-10-15,The Measures of Wealth,"New Yorkers often have trouble explaining, to themselves and others, why they submit to the extortionate demands of their hometown. When they visit one of those normally priced “quality of life” capitals — say, Portland, whether the one in Maine or in Oregon — they’re moved to wonder why they’re paying as much for their 1,000-square-foot apartment as their friend pays for his 4,000-square-foot house with a backyard big enough for flag football. In fact, slightly less than half of New Yorkers, according to a poll commissioned by the New York Times Magazine, believe that the city is not “worth what it costs.” They wouldn’t actually move, of course; that’s unthinkable. But living here in the center of the universe exacts a terrible tribute, not only in dollars but in anxiety and envy — not so much of our suburban or country cousins as of the lucky few who glide above us on the sweet breezes of wealth.

Deng told Eggers (pictured below) his story of wandering from his ruined village through the war zone to resettlement camps and finally to the United States, where he found opportunity but not safety. With “generous spirit and seemingly inexhaustible energy,” Francine Prose wrote in the Book Review, Eggers transforms Deng’s story into a novel “with the imaginative sweep, the scope and, above all, the emotional power of an epic.” Another African conflict is the subject of THE WONGA COUP: Guns, Thugs, and a Ruthless Determination to Create Mayhem in an Oil-Rich Corner of Africa, by Adam Roberts (PublicAffairs, $14.95). It describes a failed attempt, planned by a British aristocrat whose accused supporters included Sir Mark Thatcher, the former prime minister’s son, to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea and install a puppet who would let them exploit the country’s oil.

2007-10-15,Good Grief!,"Toward the end of his life Charles Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” wished he were Andrew Wyeth. What Wyeth did was fine art, he grumbled, while he was just a newspaper cartoonist, a draftsman, whose work would surely not last. In fact, “Peanuts” is still read, in anthologies and compilations, by many more people than ever looked at a Wyeth, and Schulz’s was arguably the greater talent. He transformed the newspaper cartoon strip, busy and cluttered by the time he turned up in the late ’40s, by flooding it with white space, and by reducing his childish characters to near abstraction — huge circular heads balanced on tiny bodies — he rendered them far more expressive than their cartoon peers. The strip was able to register grown-up emotions, like anxiety, depression, yearning, disillusionment, that had never been in cartoons before. Instead of the “Slam!” “Bam!” “Pow!” sound effects that were the lingua franca of the comics, it employed a quieter, more eloquent vocabulary: “Aaugh!” and “Sigh.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/McGrath-t.html

It is what you can remember.” The English Civil War is summed up, helpfully, as a “Struggle between the Cavaliers (Wrong but Wromantic) and the Roundheads (Right and Repulsive).” By these lights, William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, may have been the ultimate Cavalier. His name is linked to his ignominious defeat with Charles I’s troops at the Battle of Marston Moor, a Royalist debacle, with 4,000 men killed in a single day.

So how great to report that a Turkish Bath — or hammam — has opened its doors in Rome’s historic center. Now before you protest that a Turkish bath in Rome doesn’t feel place-appropriate, guess again: Turkish hammams are the descendents of the traditional Imperial Roman baths — more Roman than anything that exists in modern day Italy.",Travel,https://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/a-roman-turkish-bathaaah/
2007-10-15,Ambition and Heroism,"Novel? Epic poem? Historical chronicle? “War and Peace” is all of that and, as they say, more. This is the third time I’ve read it. The first was incollege for one of those loony world-lit survey courses: two weeks for “Don Quixote,” another two for “Bleak House,” etc. I missed so much of the novel; I remember skimming the war parts to get to the peace parts. The second time was right after 9/11, and the book just seemed like reportage: the generalized anxiety, the fragility, the terrifying ease with which the world can change. This time, (maybe it’s my post-Reading-Like-a-Writer phase) I’ve been trying to figure out how Tolstoy does what he does, and what I can’t get over is the almost reckless wildness of his ambition, the sheer nervy bravado of his technical competence. Anyone who’s ever tried to write fiction knows how hard it is to introduce characters, one or two at a time. Even Dickens makes sure you get a character fixed in your mind before he moves on to the next one. But Tolstoy essentially starts the book, or at least the second chapter, by plunking you down in a room crowded with major and minor characters, all talking at once, then the action moves to another room filled with completely different characters, then another household, then the home of a dying man, a house in the country, then a battle. Deal with it. And the amazing thing is that the reader can keep it all sorted out  the identities, the familial relations, the histories and hopes and fears of a huge cast. Reading it feels a little like looking at a Velásquez and trying to figure out how he puts a few dots of white paint at the end of his brush, and bingo! a string of pearls just wills itself into being.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/ambition-and-heroism/

Somehow I managed to make it through college and into late middle age without having read “War and Peace.” Though Tolstoy wrote one of my favorite pieces of fiction (“Anna Karenina”) and one of my least favorite (that misogynous chastity pamphlet, “The Kreutzer Sonata”), W&P was always too intimidating in scale, and too show-offy to bring to the beach. The Russian language I studied to work in Moscow was more functional than literary, and while my tutors dosed me with just enough Pushkin to nod appreciatively when Evgeny Onegin came up in conversation  more often than you’d think  the master of Yasnaya Polyana was scarcely mentioned. (Although I was duly warned that Tolstoy, pronounced as we pronounce him in the West, means “thick” or “fat,” and could be appropriately used to describe “War and Peace,” but in Russian the writer’s name is pronounced with the emphasis at the back.) While I’m owning up to my lack of qualifications, I should add that I have not written a literature term paper in 40 years, and that I have never participated in a book club.

But still, you might wonder how Tolstoy knows exactly how a beautiful young woman feels when she is asked to dance at a formal ball. Or how she responds when she believes that her life is being squandered in waiting for her fiancé to reappear, and a handsome man — Tolstoy so obviously enjoys writing about cads, it makes you wonder! — begins to pursue her with his seductive, unrelenting attentions.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/characters-and-contradictions/

2007-10-18,Tolstoy’s Irreverence,"Unlike my more erudite fellow panelists (and many of the readers who have posted such impressive comments), I’m making my way through the book for the first time. So my thoughts on Sam’s question — How does Tolstoy do it? — are at this point derived from the first volume: a mere 295 pages. But it strikes me that one way Tolstoy humanizes and universalizes his characters is by refusing to treat them with reverence. He allows his major figures to speak and act foolishly, to be caught in moments of pettiness, cowardice, naïveté, humiliation. Examples abound, but one of my favorites in the first volume is the way Tolstoy treats Nikolai Rostov’s puppy-love adoration of the tsar. Tolstoy himself was not immune to emperor-rapture, and it may well have been true, as he writes, that “nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love” with their tsar. But Count Nikolai’s devotion is portrayed as a paralyzing schoolboy crush — his bashful ecstasy before the beautiful visage of the young emperor, his detailed daydreams of dying in the ruler’s presence, and ultimately his juvenile terror and abject flight when the opportunity arises to approach his beloved. Tolstoy has made Rostov real by subjecting him to ridicule. I expect that in the pages to come Tolstoy, having whittled Rostov down to size in this way, will let him grow.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/tolstoys-irreverence/

2007-10-19,Test Favors Shakespeare Portrait,"A long-running argument about which painting offers a true likeness of Shakespeare has taken a new turn. Experts have found that ink on a label identifying a portrait said to be of Shakespeare dates back to his time, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The painting, right, was made by John Sanders, a Shakespearean-era actor born in 1576, and has been in the possession of Lloyd Sullivan, a retired Ottawa engineer, since his mother gave it to him in 1972. He has spent 15 years and an estimated $750,000 on tests to buttress his belief that the painting is the only true portrait of Shakespeare. On Wednesday Joseph Barabe, a forensic analyst for McCrone Associates of Chicago, said that “the formula of the ink” on a small handwritten label on the back of the Sanders painting “certainly fits” with manufacturing methods and materials from the first 50 or so years of 17th-century England. He said, “I see all of the evidence kind of falling in the realm of authenticity — and I don’t see any evidence coming forth that brings it into question.” When the painting, dated 1603, was shown last year with five other “Shakespeares” in London, it was said that the sitter appeared far younger than the 39-year-old Shakespeare would have been.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/19arts-TESTFAVORSSH_BRF.html

The finding contradicts an earlier autopsy by a New Jersey pathologist, who had found the death “directly related” to ground zero dust, and revived the emotional debate over the care and treatment of 9/11 first responders. The family of the highly decorated detective — who died in January 2006 at age 34, did not smoke and had no history of asthma — believes he died from sarcoidosis, a lung-scarring disease.

2007-10-19,Stray Questions for: Kay Ryan,"Kay Ryan (Photo: Jane Hirshfield)  Kay Ryan's most recent books of poems are ""The Niagara River"" and ""Say Uncle.""  What are you working on?   This is such a difficult question. I’m not working on anything. I’m almost never working on anything. It’s an indefensible life. What I answer when people ask is that I’m “working on my next book."" They seem completely satisfied and never have any follow-up questions. It was just something they had to get out of the way.   Novelists have it good. I always think writing a novel must be like having this large knitting project you’re working on. You have so much to do! It’s going to take ages! You can pick it up, add a little and put it down. The comforting workbasket is always with you. Even if it’s something you do in little squares, you have the larger plan of hooking the squares together. It’s going to be magnificent.  All this is naturally denied the writer of poems who is constantly drowning. I’m sorry to have to change the metaphor away from yarn products but there simply isn’t that cozy feeling about poem writing. Even if the poet has managed to build up a little island of words in the middle of the sea, stand up and take a couple breaths, the island immediately sinks and she is left treading open water again. Oh and plus, you can never build an island the way you built it last time. That’s a particularly cruel rule.  So, I’m working on my next book.   How much time - if any - do you spend on the Web? Is it a distraction or a blessing?   I really don’t spend much time on the Web, but occasionally I do look into something. For example, a few days ago a friend asked me if I would write a new mnemonic for the number of days in the months, so I looked up the “Thirty days hath September” rhyme. I found the whole history of its evolution from the middle ages. Who knew it was that old? At such times the Web feels like a blessing. But in general something in me protests that it’s too easy, and vastly too much. There were already too many connections among things.   Whose books are generally shelved next to yours in bookstores? How does it feel to be sitting between them?  I like the assumption of this question, that I am sitting between other poets on a shelf. That I am my book – or if it’s a really good bookstore – books. Because this is pitifully true. Sometimes I go to look for myself in inferior bookstores – at airports, say – and I find I don’t exist. Sometimes my entire people does not exist. From the condition of not existing, I have no way of mustering the self importance necessary to bring myself into some future being by asking to speak with the book buyer. I am unpersoned. I can barely buy gum.  ",Blogs,https://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/blogs/19papercuts-stray-qu211.html

The songs ride, invariably, on the nonstop eighth-note pulse that We Are Wolves learned from Kraftwerk and 1980’s electropop; above it are Vincent Levesque’s analog synthesizer sounds. The bass-drum beat is programmed (as is some other percussion) since Antonin Marquis plays his drum and cymbals standing up. But Mr. Ortiz’s fuzzy, insistent bass lines stray across genre lines toward punk, while his hopped-up vocal interjections owe something to John Lydon of Public Image Limited and to the primal synth-pop provocateurs, Suicide. And songs like “Teenage, Bats and Anthropology” — a fondly remembered list of teenage activities — have lyrics that are more than rhythmic placeholders. While a certain archness is built into any new analog electrpop, We Are Wolves makes it not just a joke, but a good sweaty joke.

2007-10-22,Fighting for the Barnes,"Opponents of a plan to move the Barnes Foundation and its world-renowned art collection from a Philadelphia suburb to a downtown museum quarter asked a Pennsylvania judge yesterday to reconsider his 2004 decision allowing the relocation. Lawyers for the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a community group, and for the government of Montgomery County, Pa., where the Barnes has been since its founding in the late 1920s, appeared before Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court in Norristown, Pa., to request that he reopen the case. Judge Ott’s ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, below in a portrait by Giorgio de Chirico, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion, Pa. The judge said he considered the move “the only viable alternative” to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But the opponents contend that there are now other alternatives. The county has offered to buy the foundation’s buildings and land for $50 million or more to keep the collection in place. Mark D. Schwartz, a lawyer for the Friends group, told the judge that “very simply our position is that you were misled” by the Barnes about its financial options before the 2004 decision, and he implored the judge to overturn his earlier decision immediately. Judge Ott declined and accused Mr. Schwartz of trying to play to the crowd that had packed the small courtroom. “That’s a grandstand request, and I don’t appreciate it,” he said, and then asked the parties to establish a schedule to file additional papers for the case to proceed.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/arts/design/20arts-FIGHTINGFORT_BRF.html

Judge John F. Walker  of Federal District Court in Los Angeles acted on Thursday, four days before a scheduled hearing. The Norton Simon Foundation and Marie von Saher of Greenwich, Conn., each claimed ownership of the works, which the museum’s founder, Norton Simon, bought from an heir to the Stroganoff family in the mid-1970s. The Bolsheviks seized the panels from the Stroganoffs during the Russian Revolution, according to the museum. But Ms. von Saher, who last year won the return to her family of some 200 artworks from the Dutch government, claimed that the paintings had hung in a Ukrainian church and that the Soviets had merely lumped them in with the Stroganoff collection for sale at auction. The works, she contended, belonged to her father-in-law, the art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, who bought them from the Soviets in 1931.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/arts/20arts-JUDGERULESFO_BRF.html

The space was originally underwritten by a $7 million gift from the Hermitage Development Trust, headed by the British financier Jacob Rothschild and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Yukos Oil Company. Mr. Khodorkovsky, once Russia’s richest man and a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, is in a Siberian penal colony for tax evasion and fraud, charges that he has repeatedly denied. The closing follows strained relations between Britain and Russia over the radiation-poisoning murder in London in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, another critic of Mr. Putin and a former K.G.B. agent. The Hermitage also has a branch in Amsterdam and runs an exhibition space in Las Vegas with the Guggenheim.

Travel time from ghetto shocker to hipster amusement: just under two decades. Instead of the obscenity prosecutions that greeted 2 Live Crew in 1990, Spank Rock gets knowing laughs and dance-floor bustle. And lest anyone think he’s sexist, he performed while surrounded by women onstage, including his opening acts Yo Majesty and Santogold. A trash-talking female rapper, Amanda Blank, shared Spank Rock’s tracks, with own her boasts of nasty know-how.

2007-10-22,Risqué Business," Perhaps it’s today’s Babylonian climate — impending environmental catastrophe; an unending battle in Iraq; drug-addled, pole-dancing pop tarts — that has fashion designers and nabobs of the night looking back to another turbulent time: 1920s Berlin. From the ashes of World War I, which left Germany an economic and political mess, rose the Weimar Republic, in all its artistic, intellectual and debauched glory. It was a “decade when everything appeared to have become unhinged,” Ian Buruma writes in the catalog for “Glitter and Doom: German Portraits From the 1920s,” last winter’s exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Painters, intellectuals, prostitutes and gender-bucking entertainers led the show in this erotic metropolis. Life was a cabaret — a titillating theater of ideas, sex and song, all in a cigarette haze. ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/style/tmagazine/21risque.html

A regular collaborator with style compatriots Junya Watanabe and Jun Takahashi, Kamo follows a routine when it comes to teamwork: “First, I give them my idea, and then we work closely together on it.”",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/style/tmagazine/21contributors-t.html

2007-10-22,The Future Is Drying Up,"Scientists sometimes refer to the effect a hotter world will have on this country’s fresh water as the other water problem, because global warming more commonly evokes the specter of rising oceans submerging our great coastal cities. By comparison, the steady decrease in mountain snowpack — the loss of the deep accumulation of high-altitude winter snow that melts each spring to provide the American West with most of its water — seems to be a more modest worry. But not all researchers agree with this ranking of dangers. Last May, for instance, Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of the United States government’s pre-eminent research facilities, remarked that diminished supplies of fresh water might prove a far more serious problem than slowly rising seas. When I met with Chu last summer in Berkeley, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which provides most of the water for Northern California, was at its lowest level in 20 years. Chu noted that even the most optimistic climate models for the second half of this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack will disappear. “There’s a two-thirds chance there will be a disaster,” Chu said, “and that’s in the best scenario.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/magazine/21water-t.html

2007-10-22,Paperback Row,"A WELL-PAID SLAVE: Curt Flood’s Fight for Free Agency in Professional Sports, by Brad Snyder. (Plume, $16.) When the St. Louis Cardinals wanted to trade Curt Flood to Philadelphia in 1969, the center fielder refused, even though the reserve clause allowed owners to buy and sell players as they liked. Flood sued, and while the Supreme Court upheld the reserve clause in 1972, public opinion turned against the owners, and other players took advantage of the opening Flood had created. Snyder situates Flood among the second generation of black ballplayers, who faced abuse away from the spotlight that had focused on Jackie Robinson. When Howard Cosell remarked that Flood’s salary was hardly “slave wages,” Flood retorted, “A well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave.” Snyder (pictured at right) is “a sure-handed and meticulous guide” who “knows baseball and writes about the law engagingly and clearly,” David Margolick said in the Book Review. Ira Berkow, a sports columnist for The New York Times, also writes about baseball in his memoir, FULL SWING: Hits, Runs and Errors in a Writer’s Life (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95).

2007-10-22,True Believers,"Children, even good children, hide some part of their private lives from their parents; and parents, having been young and furtive themselves, remember the impulse. So when Ruth Ramsey, the divorced 41-year-old mother who is the protagonist of Tom Perrotta’s new novel, “The Abstinence Teacher,” learns that her teenage daughter, Eliza (who could be a grumpy, pimply poster child for “The Awkward Years”), has concealed a book from her, she’s not surprised. “She must have kept it hidden in a drawer or under a mattress,” she reflects — just as she herself once hid books like “The Godfather” and “The Happy Hooker.” But the book Eliza has been keeping under wraps is not a pulp fiction fable of vice and libertinage: it’s the Bible. And Eliza has yet another secret to spring on her mother: she and her little sister, Maggie, want to start going to church. To Ruth, a tolerant, progressive sex-ed teacher, her daughters’ embrace of “Goody Two-Shoes Christianity” comes as a slap in the face. “I don’t think you’re a born-again, fundamentalist, evangelical, nut-job Christian,” she tells Eliza, not imagining she would disagree. “I believe in God,” Eliza stubbornly replies. “And I believe that Jesus is His only son, and that He died on the cross for my sins.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/books/review/Schillinger2-t.html

Gerhardie had been brought up in St. Petersburg and had read Chekhov in Russian, and his little book (long out of print) is as good an introduction to Chekhov’s work as Vladimir Nabokov’s little book is to Gogol’s. Both writers sensed what made their subjects unique and managed to convey their enthusiasm, their privileged understanding, with vivacious brevity. Gerhardie arrived at the peak of his literary renown in the 1920s. His early novels were a dramatic and happily acknowledged influence on his young contemporaries: Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene and Anthony Powell. It was Gerhardie, known as the “English Chekhov,” who introduced the influence of the great Russian into 20th-century British literature, where it still potently lingers. The Chekhovian worldview and, most particularly, the Chekhovian sense of humor have been silently and hugely assimilated.

2007-10-22,‘Fire in the Blood’," We were drinking a light punch, the kind we had when I was young, and all sitting around the fire, my Erard cousins, their children and I. It was an autumn evening, the whole sky red above the sodden fields of turned earth. The fiery sunset promised a strong wind the next day; the crows were cawing. This large, icy house is full of draughts. They blew in from everywhere with the sharp, rich tang of autumn. My cousin Hélène and her daughter, Colette, were shivering beneath the shawls I'd lent them, cashmere shawls that had belonged to my mother. They asked how I could live in such a rat hole, just as they did every time they came to see me, and Colette, who is shortly to be married, spoke proudly of the charms of the Moulin-Neuf where she would soon be living, and ""where I hope to see you often, Cousin Silvio,"" she said. She looked at me with pity. I am old, poor and unmarried, holed up in a farmer's hovel in the middle of the woods. Everyone knows I've travelled, that I've worked my way through my inheritance. A prodigal son. By the time I got back to the place where I was born, even the fatted calf had waited for me for so long it had died of old age. Comparing their lot with mine, the Erards no doubt forgave me for borrowing money I had never returned and repeated, after their daughter, ""You live like an animal here, you poor dear. You should go and spend the summer with Colette once she's settled in."" ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/books/chapters/1014-1st-nemirovsky.html

2007-10-22,24 Hour Plays: Theater from Scratch,"Tomorrow night will be the seventh annual presentation of “The 24 Hour Plays on Broadway,” the event where six writers, six directors and 24 actors get together to create and put on six ten-minute plays from scratch, all in one day. Getting a play up on Broadway under normal circumstances can take years; so doing it all in 24 hours is pretty action-packed. Think Jack Bauer meets “Waiting for Guffman.”We decided it would fun to sit in from start to finish and keep a running commentary.* I’m going to get some sleep in the quieter times–I’m not crazy–but I’ll try not to miss much. At every point over the next 24 hours some people will be awake doing something, even if it’s just staring at blank pieces of paper.The cast is usually rather dazzly and this year is no exception: Chris Rock, Billy Crudup, Lili Taylor, David Cross and Rosie Perez to name a few. The roster of writers and directors–there are six of each–includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Pulitzer finalists, a Tony winner and all sorts of other award winners. Proceeds, I should add, go to Working Playground, a non-profit organization that brings arts programs to under-served schools.Here’s a guide to what the next day will bring: at this point, the participants are arriving at the American Airlines Theater on 42nd Street to meet and will have their pictures taken. At 11 pm the writers will head over to the W Hotel, and write, in relative seclusion, until 6 am tomorrow. The directors will then show up and start reading scripts and choosing the ones they want to direct. At 8:30 the casts will show up at the theater and start rehearsals, which will go on all day.** If all goes well, the plays will be put on tomorrow night at 8 pm and then everyone will go to a big party. So that said, let’s get it started. ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/24-hour-plays-theater-from-scratch/

2007-10-22,Is New York’s Economy Due for a Hit?," Wall Street’s fortunes may be taking a turn for the worse — a development that would have major ramifications for the local economy. Major banks, most recently Bank of America, have announced shrinking profits, job cuts or both. The gloomy reports are dashing hopes that large year-end bonus checks for investment bankers and traders would continue to fuel the local economy, Patrick McGeehan writes in a news analysis. The chief economist for the city comptroller’s office says the chance of a recession is increasing. Wall Street is a critical fulcrum of the local economy, generating one of every five dollars of income in the region. Economists estimate that each new job on Wall Street leads to at least 1.3 other jobs, so for every three investment bankers laid off, four other workers are in jeopardy.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/is-new-yorks-economy-due-for-a-hit/

So says the Parisian engineer Pascal Cotte, who maintains that his highly detailed digital scans, above, of this 16th-century portrait of a Florentine merchant’s wife allowed him to burrow through layers of paint to “see” its past, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Cotte, 49, estimated that he had spent 3,000 hours analyzing data from scans he made in the Louvre’s laboratory three years ago. He said his analyses also revealed the painting’s colors as they looked on the easel, before age, varnish and restorations affected them. Although some art historians have expressed skepticism about Mr. Cotte’s findings, he said he hoped his technique could guide restoration work around the world. “To communicate our cultural heritage to our kids, we need to provide the maximum of information,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/arts/design/23arts-THEMONALISAS_BRF.html

Andrei first noticed the tree in early spring, when the tree, like him, was resisting nature’s call to rebirth. Back then, he was pleased to find the oak “scowling, motionless, ugly and stubborn.” Seeing it, he thought, “Let others, the young ones, succumb afresh to this deception, but we know life — our life is over!” Andrei had given up his hopes of joy in life until they were rekindled when he met Natasha. The green leaves remind him that his life is not “over at 31,” and is not independent, but interwoven with many other lives, and with forces larger than himself. “My life is not only for myself,” he realizes. “It is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!”",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/a-man-for-all-times/

2007-10-23,Transcending Period and Place,"Well, it’s precisely that combination — the familiarity and the exoticism, the immersion in a particular historical period and the almost eerie “modernity” — that makes the novel so extraordinary and so engrossing. So many events and characters have contemporary, or near contemporary, counterparts. Pierre’s attraction to Masonry evokes, for me, all the longing and discontent that drove so many people in the 1960s and 70s to follow some goofy guru or other; every era (including ours) has its spiritual charlatans. Tolstoy’s characterization of Napoleon — the pettiness of his vanity, his shortsighted refusal to consider any views that don’t mirror his own — is distressingly reminiscent of the absolute worst, and most dangerous, qualities of today’s world leaders. The beautiful scene in which Andrei’s interest in the war and (by extension) his career is dwarfed by the pressures and terrors of caring for a sick child — variant versions of that are playing themselves out, at this moment, in homes and families everywhere. And yet, as we read the novel, we are constantly being reminded of how much has changed: everyday manners and mores, notions of female virtue and dishonor, the givens of class, status, family obligation. The duel has been replaced by the drive-by, and happily, it’s no longer taken for granted that sensible parents can, and actually should, auction off their marriageable daughter (or son, for that matter) to the wealthiest bidder.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/transcending-period-and-place/

2007-10-24,Karma Rewards Ferrari Champion,"Kimi Raikkonen celebrating after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. (Photo by Kerim Okten/European Pressphoto Association) More photos.When Kimi Raikkonen, racing for Ferrari, won the 2007 Formula One world championship on Sunday, it definitely had the feeling of karma finally coming back around for him -- although it took a while to develop. After qualifying on Saturday, Raikkonen sat third, behind Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton, who qualified first and second. Fernando Alonso was fourth. At that point, it would’ve been tough to believe in a Raikkonen title.  Then Hamilton made a big mistake. Fighting Alonso for position through the fourth corner, he braked late and ran wide, falling behind and tracking over the cross-grained curb. The two Ferraris pulled away with the lead.  I wasn’t rooting against Hamilton. And I would have been thrilled with a Hamilton win. But deep down I was pulling for Raikkonen (even though I said it was unlikely that he'd take the title). Here's why:  Formula One is filled with conflicts of social guilt, which could be best illustrated by the fact that the championship came down to two teams that spend a combined $700 million each year – much of that going toward parts used in a single grand prix before being scrapped. By and large, Formula One drivers are coddled like precious show ponies. They spend more time thinking about the scruff of their facial growth and mutton chops than their fans, who shell out hundreds to watch them from afar. They lack emotion, speak only in clichés, and only a few sign autographs (and don’t enjoy it). The ugliness spilled out this season reached a new peak, with the Ferrari-McLaren spy story and courtroom proceedings, backstabbing e-mails and ego wars.  Rooting for one multimillionaire cover-boy zombie over another makes me very self-aware of the indefensible nature of my support. Raikkonen has never been an easy guy to root for. He doesn't seem care for the history of Formula One. He's reclusive. And he speaks like a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica. But he's also one of the most naturally gifted drivers in the history of the sport. And one of the unluckiest. And deep down in the layers of chance and probability that factor into each sporting event and season, there lurked the slimmest of opportunities for karma to return some of what it took from Raikkonen over the past five years. How could you root against that?  *  Though Raikkonen was just two points from the title in 2003, everyone talks about 2004, his third season with McLaren, as the one that best symbolizes the rotten luck that would plague his racing career. Known for producing tremendously reliable racecars, McLaren lost its touch that year, and Raikkonen's engines kept going kablooey. In the first seven races, he only completed two. At Hockenheim he lost his rear wing while lapping at 180 m.p.h. The wing just detached from the car, a completely freak occurrence, a one-in-a-million malfunction from a team that never leaves its Tag Heuers unsynchronized. But still, it was Michael Schumacher’s year, as he won 15 out of 18 races and clinched the championship with four races remaining.   The following year, on the other hand, was definitely in Raikkonen’s reach.   Slide Show: Highlights of Kimi Raikkonen's Career  In 2005, Raikkonen had overcome some early misfortunes (bad tire valve, and bad tires in general) to contend for the championship. But while leading the European Grand Prix, he flat-spotted a tire while lapping Jacques Villeneuve. The tire’s irregular shape caused his suspension to vibrate excessively. These were the days of the single-tire rule, and Raikkonen wasn’t allowed to stop for a tire change without suffering a penalty that would put him out of the points. The team decided to take a chance and left him out on the track. It almost worked. But on the final lap, the suspension failed, and he smashed into a tire wall. He lost the championship that year to Alonso by 21 points.   It looked like Raikkonen was on track for a similar outcome this season. His only DNFs were from mechanical problems. Heading into Brazil, he had more career wins than several world champions. Next year, he would have passed Stirling Moss as the driver with the most wins without a title. In other words, he was due for some good luck, but even with a strong start and a fast car, so many other things had to go right:  - First of all, he needed to win -- not necessarily a given in Brazil, where he had yet to win a grand prix.  - He needed Hamilton to finish sixth or worse. Hamilton ended the suspense early when he took the long way around turn four, after battling Alonso through the Senna S’s and the back straight. But by the second lap, Hamilton had already reclaimed several lost positions. He was definitely on the charge when his gearbox went on the blink, suddenly shifting to neutral and staying there for several seconds. There are reports that Hamilton says he accidentally thumbed the button for the start sequence (of course, McLaren has denied this), but whatever happened, Hamilton was 18th by the time his car recovered.  - In order for Hamilton to finish with less than four points, Raikkonen needed the BMW Saubers and Nico Rosberg’s Williams-Toyota to stay between Hamilton and the three leaders. This meant that two young second-year drivers (Rosberg and Robert Kubica) needed to drive cleanly while fighting for position throughout the final stint of the race. It also meant that Rosberg’s car had to stay together through an entire race, which didn’t happen much this season.   - Massa had to finish second behind Raikkonen. In the post-race interview, Raikkonen said that the Ferraris were much faster than the rest of the field (and had more speed than they revealed in the race), so it probably wasn’t that difficult for Massa to stay far ahead of Alonso. Even so, he nearly went off a few laps before the final pitstop but managed to recover after losing only several seconds.  (By the way, how upset did Felipe Massa look on the podium and in the post-race interview? If fact, he looked more upset than Raikkonen looked happy. Massa seemed to go out of his way to not congratulate Raikkonen, saying he was happy for the team instead. His lack of tact was made more striking when Fernando Alonso began his first statement by offering his congratulations. I can understand being disappointed, but not enough not to congratulate his teammate.)  - McLaren needs to lose its appeal against the stewards, which should be heard by the F.I.A. in a couple of weeks. At the end of the grand prix in Brazil, the stewards confiscated the two Sauber BMWs and Nico Rosberg’s Williams to check for a fuel temperature violation. The results were inconclusive and no penalties were handed down. But McLaren has filed an appeal against the ruling. Should they win, it still isn't immediately evident that the F.I.A. would disqualify the three cars in question, which would take the championship away from Raikkonen and award it to Hamilton. Several drivers have spoken out against this result, including Hamilton, Alonso, and former driver Stirling Moss. But still, it’s Raikkonen we’re talking about, so anything can happen...

Thankfully, each team has at least four games remaining against teams with losing records, but that doesn’t mean the prognosis is good. Alex Marvez at foxsports.com and Clark Judge at cbssportsline.com break down the Rams and Dolphins in an effort to learn when the madness will end.

It took months of negotiating and crafting a proposal for how his responsibilities would be handled, but eventually his firm agreed.

And he is, I think, particularly acute on the relationship between Tolstoy and his century, the question Sam has posed for our panel. So let’s leave Andrei and Pierre and Natasha and the rest for a moment, and time-machine forward to the 20th century. Berlin’s clever template for the discussion of great thinkers was, as the hyperliterates who have been participating in this discussion know better than I, “The Hedgehog and the Fox.” The hedgehog, in Berlin’s formulation, views the world through one great defining idea, a “single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate.” To this category Berlin assigns Dante, Plato, Hegel, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Proust and others. The more intellectually promiscuous fox, in contrast, pursues “many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way,” not joined by an overarching moral or aesthetic principle. Aristotle, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce and, of course, Shakespeare, are foxes.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/ich-bin-ein-berliner/

Endurance is crucial, too, she writes, especially in those core muscles, “since it keeps the stabilizing muscles and connective tissues going through a long workout or game.” Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but there may be a silver lining: “Having a strong back, you will be happy to hear, means not doing sit-ups.

Tess Gallagher, Carver’s widow, is spearheading an effort to have all 17 of the stories in that book published, unedited, in a new volume that she plans to call “Beginners.” The stories were radically edited and cut by Gordon Lish, then Carver’s editor at Alfred A. Knopf. At the time, Carver tried to halt publication of the book, which cemented his literary reputation. Gary Fisketjon, Carver’s editor at Knopf later in his career, is opposed to her plans, partly because Carver had the chance to restore some of the stories to their unedited form in later collections. Andrew Wylie, the agent representing Ms. Gallagher and Carver’s literary estate in the effort to publish “Beginners,” said he and William L. Stull, a professor of English at the University of Hartford, and Mr. Stull’s wife, Maureen P.

2007-10-26,How Little We’ve Learned in Two Centuries,"I agree that it might be a good idea to read the book every five years, to note the astonishing way it seems to change as the world around us changes. I mentioned in an earlier post that I read the novel right after 9/11, and I remember thinking that the scene in which Pierre sees the French cook being flogged as a spy reminded me of the ways in which innocent Muslims were being targeted. Once more, the book seems relevant to the current moment. I only wish that the battles Tolstoy describes sounded less like the war in Iraq. Obviously, the weaponry and technology are very different. Satellite communications have replaced those poor messengers galloping in with the bad news; missiles and tanks have taken the place of muskets and stallions. And the military strategists no longer (literally) stand on the hilltops watching all hell break loose on the plains below. But nearly everything else — the inequities, the dispositions of power, the costly mistakes and the inadequate responses to those mistakes, the bloodshed and chaos and misery — all that seems painfully familiar. Old Kotuzov dies in his bed, and Napoleon and the Tsar aren’t the ones being blown to bits at Borodino; young men were, and are still, taking the hit — so to speak — for the leaders who send them off to battle. I’ve always thought that Tolstoy’s mini-essay, in Volume IV, on the difficulty of waging war against small, mobile, highly motivated bands of guerilla fighters should have been, and should be, required reading for everyone in the military, from rank and file soldiers to Pentagon planners, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense. Quite honestly, this has been, for me, the least pleasant aspect of rereading the novel: the sobering realization of how modern those sections seem, and of how little we appear to have learned in almost two centuries.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/how-little-weve-learned-in-two-centuries/

I think Tolstoy wrote like a hedgehog, but acted like a fox. My father, a Russian literature professor, has been corresponding with me during this panel (as have many of my friends, notably one who recently translated Zamyatin’s “We,” a book that should be more often read — at least as often as “1984,” which seems to have won the totalitarian futuristic fable competition). My father reminded me that Tolstoy did not bring his Olympian understanding of human nature to his own family life — at least, according to his wife Sofia Andreevna. In her letters (now on display at American University, along with photos of Yasnaya Polyana, the Tolstoy estate), she complains about his need to be treated like a god, and not to be bothered by daily concerns. He died, essentially, running away from home. But why can’t a man’s reach exceed his grasp?

2007-10-29,Letters: Iraq Numbers,"Re “The Reality in Iraq? Depends on Who’s Counting” (Oct. 7):I worked out of The New York Times Baghdad bureau from November 2003 to May 2007. One of the main points you addressed, how the military defines sectarian killings, has long been a major point of contention in Iraq.Reporters there have never had a clear picture of the military definition of the term. A question at the heart of the debate is whether the military counts bombing victims, including ones from the ubiquitous car bombs, when tallying deaths from sectarian violence. You cite a military manual that says the victims of such bombings should be counted.But while in Iraq, I found that in practice, the top commanders generally did not count deaths from bombings as sectarian killings, even though it is clear to even the most casual observer of the war that the bombings are motivated by sectarian and ethnic hatreds. Rocket and mortar attacks also were not counted.Instead, at least during my time in Iraq, American commanders usually counted only people shot dead as victims of sectarian violence. The reasons are obscure. Some critics of the military say the commanders might have done this because it would be easier at some point to prove a downward trend in violence if one looked only at victims killed in shootings, rather than victims killed in shootings and bombings. The American military and Shiite-led Iraqi government have yet to find a way of ending the horrific bombings carried out by Sunni Arab insurgents.Only once did a military officer articulate the military’s point of view on this issue to me. A top general in Baghdad told me the military had chosen to limit its definition of sectarian killings because it wanted to track specifically the type of violence that occurred by shooting, because some officers apparently believed that this type of killing, rather than bombings and projectile attacks, was a more accurate indicator of the level of Shiite-Sunni sectarian hatred out in the streets.Some critics have said that another reason for leaving bombings outside the definition of sectarian violence is directly related to the Bush administration’s pronouncements on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The military usually attributes large bombings to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and its spokesmen still claim that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is trying to “ignite” or “inflame” sectarian civil war in Iraq rather than acknowledging that the largely Sunni Arab group is a crucial player in one side of an already raging Iraqi civil war.As you noted in an earlier column, American officials have long sought to depict Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as an outside organization with close ties to Osama bin Laden that seeks to destroy the Sunni-Shiite “relationship” in Iraq. Actually, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a component of the Sunni-Shiite civil war, not an outside element. As you know, the reality is that a vast majority of members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia are Iraqi Sunnis who are trying to overthrow the Shiite-run Iraqi government.So critics of the military have asserted that the military has in practice sought to remove bombing victims from the definition of “sectarian killings” so that bomb attacks, and their victims, would not be seen as part of an Iraqi civil war. Rather, they would be counted as part of the “terrorist” actions done by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which military spokesmen and Bush administration officials have for years tried to portray as an outside force, not one that is part of the internal Iraqi dynamic.In other words, whether to count bombings when measuring sectarian violence has become embroiled in the politics of defining the main narrative of the Iraq war. Critics say the less the war looks like an internal civil war and the more it looks like a front in the global jihad movement or in the Western war against “Islamo-fascism,” the more the Bush administration can justify its policies and the continuing American military presence in Iraq.The bottom line is that car bombs and other types of bombings, as well as rocket and mortar attacks, are major tactics in the ethno-sectarian civil war that has been unfolding in Iraq for years, and should by anyone’s definition be counted as sectarian violence.Edward WongTaipei, Taiwan, Oct. 7, 2007●Be it 1,654, 1,280 or 827, the number of Iraqi civilians being killed every month is a horrific tragedy. These “numbers” are actually human beings — mothers, fathers, sons and daughters — and this is not acceptable.Nor is the tragedy in this country acceptable — 30,000 civilian deaths every year from gunshot wounds. Why isn’t this number reported on a regular basis, along with the 65,000 wounded?The cost in dollars for medical care is about $15 billion annually and, the cost in human suffering is incalculable. If these figures were coming out of Iraq — 2,500 Americans dead and more than 5,000 wounded a month — the war would be over. Why do we accept this casualty rate on our local streets with no discussion and little dismay while we (quite rightly) give at least some attention to civilian deaths in Iraq?Andrea CukorBerkeley, Calif., Oct. 8, 2007●",Opinion,https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/letters-iraq-numbers/
2007-10-29,"Letters:”Questions and Answers, in No Particular Order”","Re “Questions and Answers, in No Particular Order” (Oct. 14):As a writing instructor at a public university, I’m always on the lookout for good interviews to use as models for my students to follow. While I use interviews from The Times’s business and science sections, I do not use Deborah Solomon’s work. Her interviews routinely belabor her cleverness at the expense of her subjects.Her questionable methods come as no surprise. Such hostile questions and quips could hardly have elicited all the responses she claims. More disquieting to me as a Times reader, however, was the reaction of Gerald Marzorati, the editor of the magazine. I agree with your assessment that just because Ms. Solomon’s interviews are “an entertainment” doesn’t mean she can disregard The Times’s standards. I’m left wondering if everything in the magazine is “an entertainment.”Nicole ArchambeauSanta Barbara, Calif., Oct. 16, 2007●I had always believed that “Questions For” was a verbatim transcription of a brief interview. To find that it is Deborah Solomon’s willy-nilly editing of an hour-long conversation is something different. In the future, I will skip reading it. I don’t consider it New York Times-quality reporting.Chris AltweggSeattle, Oct. 14, 2007●What stuck me like a lightning bolt was your statement that the “Questions For” column is viewed by its writer and editors as entertainment.While I understand and appreciate the pressure that cable stations and Internet blogs impose on traditional news, the fact is that The New York Times has been the gold standard of newspapers because of the journalist standards that the paper has imposed on itself. If those standards are being abandoned, fine. But please, let us know that this is the case, that The Times is no better that the countless competitors online and in print.Richard DashefskyPhiladelphia, Pa., Oct. 15, 2007●Deborah Solomon’s misquotation and self-promotion are exactly what reporters should never do.Her manipulations cast an extremely negative light on The Times, and make readers wonder: If the paper refuses to discipline a reporter who exaggerates and distorts trivial matters, how does it handle what is really important?Simon DeDeoChicago, Oct. 15, 2007●You paint a dismaying portrait of the care with which the Times Magazine’s “Questions For” column is produced.Add to the criticisms the failure of the questioner Deborah Solomon or the Magazine’s editors to disclose, in a June 26, 2005, interview with Bruce Ratner, the Atlantic Yards developer and New Jersey Nets principal owner, that Mr. Ratner’s company was a development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters.Byron Calame, the public editor at the time, chastised The Times in his Web journal for the failure to disclose such ties, but no letter or disclosure was ever printed.Norman OderBrooklyn, Oct. 15, 2007The writer writes the Atlantic Yards Report, a blog devoted to the Atlantic Yards project.●Thanks for raising some of the troubling issues surrounding quotations in The Times Magazine. This deals with one of the most important — but rarely discussed — challenges facing reporters and interviewers: how to capture the spoken word and put it in type.As a former newspaper journalist and longtime teacher of news writing, I know that we even have a tough time quoting material that’s easy to look up and verify. (Consider the alterations to the iconic Vietnam-era utterance: “It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.”)You covered the issue of whether or not there’s a “protocol” or manual for the handling of quotations. You mentioned The Times’s Manual of Style and Usage, which is very clear on the topic. The Associated Press’s style book has gone through changes over the past few decades and reads similarly. Frank HerronWinchester, Mass., Oct. 16, 2007The writer is an adjunct instructor of political science at UMass Boston.●I have been appalled to see the inclusion of these bogus “interviews.” Deborah Solomon’s sole intent seems to be to skewer, disrespect, and hurt her subjects. Her columns are devoid of genuine content, at most reflecting the interviewee’s ability to respond gracefully to hostile sniping.It is no surprise that Ms. Solomon has been playing fast and loose with her questions and editing. Here is one loud plea for the magazine to drop “Questions For” entirely, with an apology to readers for having published it for so long.Lyn OppenheimFelton, Calif., Oct. 17, 2007●For years, I have been uncomfortable reading the “Questions For” column. Now I know why.Usually the challenging questions read more like an attempt to trap the famous person. This may entertain some, but it doesn’t work for me. In fact — even beyond not living up to The Times’s standards — it is blatantly rude.Sharon AucoinNorth Andover, Mass., Oct. 15, 2007●I agree with your view that the Deborah Solomon “Questions For” columns need a disclaimer noting that they are the result, frequently, of several different interviews or contacts, and that the order has been altered or new questions inserted for “readability.”I find many of her columns snarky and mean-spirited, and to realize that they are largely stitched together on her whim is even more disturbing. The magazine’s editors really have given way too much free rein here.Many of us were taught that quotes were sacrosanct, and use ellipses or brackets when we truncate or otherwise edit quoted material. I think it’s unfair to readers to pass off a crazy quilt of questions and answers as an “interview,” though what an accurate label should be isn’t clear.

But they didn’t impress Larkin, who reviewed jazz records from 1961 to 1971 for The Daily Telegraph and could barely tolerate even Coltrane’s most accessible late music, like the devotional suite “A Love Supreme.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/books/review/Mishra-t.html

But St. Lucia's under-the-radar status is changing as a bevy of new luxury resorts vie for the best view and the most over-the-top amenities. Still, if the $1,000-a-night, private-plunge-pool experience doesn't appeal to you or your wallet, deals abound, and with them, a chance to sample the real St. Lucia.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/travel/28stlucia.html

When he’s treating an invalid (pronounce the word however seems appropriate) like me, he will have to proceed like a therapist faced with a physical inadequacy that can’t, of itself, be fixed. His prose is going to have to work on the surrounding muscle to compensate for a more deep-seated weakness.

For them, it’s all about the period called the Hot Stove, and baseball’s rumor-mad off-season really starts boiling at the annual winter meetings, in which league muckety-mucks congregate in a hotel to sit through slide shows, bounce around trade ideas and try to avoid late-night peccadilloes at the bar. From Dec. 3-6, the eyes of every obsessive baseball fan will be focused on the sprawling Gaylord Opryland in Nashville, where this year’s meeting will be held. It’s the one time of year when everyone — the G.M. and his assistants, the agents and their lackeys, the scouts and their scotch — assembles in one place. The marquee event is the Rule 5 draft (in which teams select among players who have more than three years’ experience and are not on a team’s 40-man roster), held on the final day and broadcast on MLB.com, though the more festive attendees are probably partial to the “annual banquet,” a formal affair that closes the meetings. (This year, according to the agenda, it features a “traditional holiday dinner with all the trimmings” as well as the vocal stylings of country-music artist Pam Tillis.)",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/sports/playmagazine/28mainevent.html

The very long letter, printed on Nov. 11, 1973, was sent by Timothy Leary. Here are some selections: “For 30 years, I have read critiques in your pages dealing with the great scoundrels of history: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Nixon, et al. I cannot recall any of your reviewers being so angry at a public figure as to confess homicidal wishes. Now comes Midge Decter, whose review of Myra Friedman’s book, ‘Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin,’ has just reached me. It finds the behavior of a contemporary artist (the subject of the Friedman biography) ‘so profoundly infuriating’ that ‘one [i.e., Decter] would have been driven to throttle her on the spot.’ Your middle-aged, middle-class readership will love Midge Decter’s comments. She tells them what they wish to hear: the bad girl takes dope and comes to a bad end. ... ‘To know who Janis Joplin was,’ says Midge Decter, ‘is to know a good deal, if not indeed everything that matters about the epidemic of antic despair that carried off so many of our children in the late 1960s.’ What pretentious rot! ... I hope that Janis would like this letter better than The Times’s review. It’s a small act of love for her ... and her eyes would sunshine thanks, and she’d hand me a bottle of Southern Comfort. ...

2007-10-29,Paperback Row,"COLLECTED POEMS, 1947-1997, by Allen Ginsberg. (Harper Perennial, $25.) Allen Ginsberg (pictured at right) died in 1997, but he is still making trouble. Earlier this month, 50 years after a judge ruled that his poem “Howl” was not obscene because it had “redeeming social importance,” a New York radio station declined to broadcast it for fear of being fined for indecency by the Federal Communications Commission. Luckily “Howl” appears in this new edition of Ginsberg’s “Collected Poems,” along with classics like “Kaddish” and nearly 1,200 pages’ worth of other, sometimes uneven but always exuberant work. A companion to the poems is I CELEBRATE MYSELF: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg (Penguin, $18), a well-researched, readable biography by Ginsberg’s friend and archivist Bill Morgan. It follows the writer from his New Jersey childhood through his incarnation as a Beat poet in New York and San Francisco to his role as the bard of the antiwar movement of the 1960s.

If athletes who read books are seen as dangerous radicals (Bouton was known as “the Communist” around the New York Yankees clubhouse of the 1960s), then athletes who write them are even more so. Bouton, then a pitcher on the downside of his career, revealed the seedy side of Mickey Mantle. Meggyesy was a linebacker who read C. Wright Mills.

At 23, Dudamel was not only an unusually young contestant; this session with the Bamberg Symphony marked his first time conducting a professional orchestra. He seemed unfazed. “You are young and inexperienced, but you should somehow create an aura of confidence and authority,” Salonen explained to me recently. “Gustavo is not concerned about authority. He is concerned about music, which is exactly the right approach. The orchestra gets seduced into playing well for him, rather than forced.” After the prize was awarded to Dudamel, Salonen telephoned Deborah Borda, president of the L.A. Philharmonic. “He says, ‘Deborah, you won’t believe this kid from Venezuela who won the competition,’ ” Borda recounted to me. “I said, ‘What’s he like?’ He said: ‘He’s a conducting animal.

Pollack, who once wrote speeches for Bill Clinton, had a bone to pick with the University of Michigan, which he has been rooting for since he was 6. One of the country’s most storied football schools, Michigan fielded its first football team 120 years ago; was a charter member of the Big Ten when the conference was formed, 111 years ago; won the first Rose Bowl, in 1902; and is the winner of 42 conference and 11 national championships. Michigan’s football team generated around $50 million of the $87 million the athletic department reaped last year — figures that trail only those of its archrival, Ohio State, in the Big Ten. Much of that money comes from such things as television rights, licensing fees for the school’s logo and so on.

What did she ever create? She was only a wife, far less interesting than the great men she was married to.

There were just two seconds left, and the Saints were losing, which wasn't unusual. The unusual thing was that the game was still close: 17-16. The Saints had the ball, and a field goal would win it — except the ball was in the Saints' half of the field, on the 43-yard line. And the record distance the ball would have to travel — 63 yards — was only the first of the kicker's problems. He was kicking from a dirt surface churned up like a World War I battlefield. The ball would need to cut through the thick, humid New Orleans air and into the closed end of Tulane Stadium, where the wind swirled unpredictably. On top of all that, the kicker lacked the most basic requirement for his job: a foot.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/sports/playmagazine/28lewis.html

Zelikman, a blond European scarecrow whose heart has “turned to stone,” and Amram, a towering African, are apt if unlikely companions on the Silk Road’s shifting social terrain. Each has his pet passions — Zelikman for his hat and his horse, Amram for a sword called Mother-Defiler — and they bicker like the two leads in a buddy film, in this case bound together by the accident of birth that made them both Jewish.

But by the time Campbell’s father became the 25th thane of Cawdor, its potency seems to have waned. In her memoir, “A Charmed Life,” a witch takes up residence at Cawdor Castle, doubling as an evil stepmother. By that time, Campbell’s father has transformed himself into the sort of charming monster Shakespeare might have relished. Unlike Macbeth, he wasn’t responsible for a murder — unless you count the destruction of a priceless ancestral legacy.

I felt strongly that Matsuzaka would get a hit against the Colorado Rockies.Even though Matsuzaka was 0 for 4 with the Red Sox this season, I watched videotape of him in two games in Koshien, Japan’s famous high school tournament, for an article last February and felt he had a sweet swing. He hit cleanup for his high school and I was guessing that he hadn’t totally lost his stroke.So while I was at lunch with my Times colleagues Tyler Kepner and Ben Shpigel, and Mike Vaccaro and Joel Sherman of The New York Post, I predicted that Dice-K would get a hit. My prediction didn’t cause a stir. No one stopped chewing. The waitress didn’t write it down. But I wanted to have my thoughts on the record.Sure enough, when Matsuzaka batted in the third inning against Josh Fogg, he rapped a single into left field to drive in two runs. Matsuzaka gave Boston a 6-0 lead and made himself look great. He also made me look good. I can brag for about three seconds over lunch today.

Mr. Davis, who is also music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, was appointed artistic adviser, and the rest of the rotation consisted of Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor and Marek Janowski as a guest conductor. But last January, Mr. Tamburri announced that the orchestra had appointed Manfred Honeck, an Austrian conductor, as its music director starting in September 2008.

2007-10-29,Motorcycle Fantasyland in Tokyo,"Honda EVO6 (Photo by Jerry Garrett) More Photos  TOKYO -- Although most of the media focus at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show is on the three convention halls stuffed with the latest four-wheel dream machines, Tokyo is the only major auto show that also showcases motorcycles. They're over in a pulsating big top tent officially called the North Hall, but for bikers, it should be called Fantasyland -- something on the order of ""Blade Runner"" meets the mechanical bull scene in ""Urban Cowboy.""  Besides the eyeball-assaulting light show, music loud enough to make your ears bleed and models in go-go boots and vinyl minidresses, there is a full spectrum of new rides, from futuristic to retro.  Let's start at the Honda booth, where on one side, it's back to the future, and on the other, Jimmy Carter is president again: the CB1100F, to me, evokes great old Hondas like the CBX, albeit with fewer exhaust pipes. Others will see what they want to see, but either way, it's a beaut. The CB1100R (R for race) is about as '70s as shag carpet, monaural LPs and polyester pants. Great retro themes overall though, and certainly buildable.   Muscle Bike Party: the Honda EVO6 has some really outer-galaxy styling and it's coupled with a smart use of Honda's underutilized six-cylinder engine from the Gold Wing. Output in this format would be more than the Gold Wing's 118 horsepower. It looks like the styling department, however, ran out of time before they got to the rear of the bike.   The Suzukis are wild. Silent runner: the Crosscage is a fuel cell bike that really works; no gas engine at all. The powerplant is made by Intelligent Energy of the U.K., the same group that made the ENV fuel cell bike I tested -- and thought was viable even if it sounded like a U.F.O., not a bike. The Biplane supposedly has a V-4, but the show bike is most likely a make-believe mockup. Looks to be straight out of a video game. When will either Suzuki be produced? Right after the 12th of Never.  Suzuki Biplane concept (Photo by Robert Gilhooly/European Pressphoto Association) More Photos  Yamaha's Tesseract looks like it wound up on the cutting room floor from the ""Transformers"" movie. It has another one of those dreamweaver hybrid powerplants; the jury is out whether it would even be classified as a motorcycle. Would it look quite as cool with air bags, seatbelts and impact-resistant bumpers? I don't think so. It's kind of a grown-up version of one of those scooters for the ""help-I've-fallen-and-can't-get-up crowd."" Perfect for cruising supermarket aisles. A lot of showgoers cooed over the retro-classic Yamaha Sakura. A standard-style bike with an 1,100cc V-twin would generate a lot of showroom traffic, methinks.  Finally, at the Kawasaki stand, the Z1000 gets a new suspension layout that helps improve engine and exhaust placement; that, in turn, permitted some low- and mid-range performance gains. KZ also says this screamer has better suspension components and brakes. But the leaner, meaner ZX10R is the more significant new intro, now with 170-175 horsepower, thanks to dual fuel injectors on each cylinder. Compression ratio is up to -- yikes -- 12.7:1. Stand back when you fire that puppy up.   The Ninja ZX-14 had to be massaged to meet tighter emissions standards, especially in Europe, so Kawasaki engineers thought, ""Why not ratchet up that engine output while we're at it?"" Horsepower was already an unpublished number, but now, figure it has been bumped north of 180 at the rear wheel, 200 or more at the crankshaft. Last but far from least: A new 2-into-1 exhaust on the Ninja 250R perks up the engine; a new full fairing perks up its looks.  Important Note: Kawasaki was showing bikes they will produce; the competitors were showing daydreams they (and we) wish they could.  Google these bikes, or check out our slide show.

2007-10-30,Elizabeth Taylor to Keep Van Gogh,"An effort by heirs of a German Jewish art collector to recover a van Gogh painting once owned by their great-grandmother and now owned by Elizabeth Taylor, below, ended yesterday when the United States Supreme Court refused to hear their appeal of a ruling that their lawsuit against the actress was filed too late. Ms. Taylor’s father, an art dealer, bought the painting for her at auction in 1963. The painting, “Vue de l’Asile et de la Chapelle de Saint-Rémy,” painted in 1889, had been sold by the estate of Alfred Wolf, a Jewish businessman who fled Germany in the 1930s. An earlier owner was Margarete Mauthner, another Jewish refugee; in 2003, four of Ms. Mauthner’s great-grandchildren wrote Ms. Taylor asserting that while the painting had not been confiscated by the Nazis, Ms. Mauthner had disposed of it under duress and they were entitled to its return under laws to deal with Holocaust-era restitution claims. Ms. Taylor refused, and the heirs sued the next year in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. The district court, noting that Ms. Taylor’s ownership of the painting had been publicized for decades, dismissed the suit as untimely. In addition, the court said, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act did not authorize private lawsuits. The ruling was upheld on appeal in May.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/arts/30arts-ELIZABETHTAY_BRF.html

Writing on the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Web site (richmondfed.org), Doug Campbell, an economist, addressed the furor over tickets with a face value of $26 and $56 that sell for hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars, prompting complaints from fans and their parents. “To economists, this complaint misses the point,” Mr. Campbell wrote of one of them. “The ticket company didn’t inflate the price; the forces of supply and demand did.” He added, “The more fundamental issue is that the promoters of the ‘Hannah Montana’ series apparently haven’t priced tickets commensurate with the demand, opening the door to a secondary market with much higher prices.” Mr. Campbell suggested that one solution “would be a system in which a certain number of seats are auctioned off to the highest bidders, with the remaining ones sold for a flat price. This aids the promoter in not over- or underpricing tickets beforehand and more closely mimics a true market for high-valued seats.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/arts/31arts-THEFEDOPINES_BRF.html

Elliot Spitzer’s more controversial plans: “Hillary Rodham Clinton stumbled badly at last night’s Democratic debate when she repeatedly refused to give a direct answer about whether she supports Gov. Spitzer’s plan to give driver’s licenses to illegal aliens – and got slammed by her opponents for evasive double-talk,” the paper reports. “The driver’s-license issue puts Clinton in a bind, because opposing giving them to illegals could alienate Hispanic voters and left-wing activists who are influential in the primary, while favoring the plan could alienate many moderate voters with whom the plan is highly unpopular.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/target-hillary/

My husband, Warren, grew up in Queens and, frankly, he hated it.”But Ms. Sloan and her husband, Warren Lehrer, did fall in love with Queens, where they have now lived for years. Their 2003 oral history of Queens immigrants, “Crossing the BLVD: Strangers, Neighbors, Aliens in a New America,” based on hundreds of interviews, amounted to a whirlwind tour and love poem of what has often been called the most racially and ethnically diverse county in America.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/an-oral-history-of-queens-immigrants-hits-the-road/

2007-11-01,Translation and Journalism,"The discussion this week of the translator’s art has made for a fascinating round, and has brought out some perceptive comments from readers. For a former foreign correspondent — and an editor with reporters dispersed around the globe — this is a discussion with decidedly extra-literary implications. While we try to assign correspondents overseas who are fluent in the relevant language, there is no way that a paper as serious about international news as The Times can operate without interpreters. Many, many interpreters. As a reporter, I’ve worked with native interpreters of languages from Armenian to Zulu, and have come to believe that the craft of working with an interpreter is at least as important in our line of work as the mastery of languages. The obvious imperative in working with a translator is to get the facts right. (Witness the recent dispute over what Ahmadinejad actually said about gays during his speech at Columbia University.) But beyond that, it’s about getting the voice right. The quality of a translation goes not just to accuracy of detail or intent, not just to felicity of language, but to clarity, nuance and credibility. An intellectual who makes a powerful point in Polish or Pashto can sound less convincing in a clumsy translation. A good translation can convey the charisma of a rabble-rouser, the egotism of a tyrant, the wit of a poet, the heartbreak of a victim; a bad translation can deny us the sense of character.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/translation-and-journalism/
