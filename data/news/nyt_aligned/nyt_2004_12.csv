Analysts said the move was an apparent attempt to assure investors that relations have improved between the brothers and to shore up the stock prices of the companies in the Reliance group, India's largest industrial conglomerate. Shares of Reliance Industries fell about 10 percent and Reliance Energy fell by about 15 percent after the conflict became known two weeks ago. The directors resigned on Thursday but Reliance Energy did not say why.

Revenue rose to 4.6 billion Canadian dollars from 4.4 billion. The quarterly performance was hurt by a charge of 192 million Canadian dollars associated with the layoffs and with other cost-cutting moves that were part of a restructuring program that was announced in September. About 40 employees, most of them executives and senior managers, were told last month that their jobs were being eliminated. The balance of the work force reductions will come next year. The latest quarterly results were also affected by the Royal Bank's decision to write down the value of its RBC Mortgage operation, which is based in Chicago, by 130 million Canadian dollars.

2004-12-01,World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Economic Growth Surges,"Brazil's economy grew at its fastest pace in the third quarter in eight years, lifted by surging exports and a sharp increase in domestic consumption. The government's statistics agency said that gross domestic product expanded 6.1 percent from July through September compared with the year-earlier period. The most recent performance was the fastest growth rate for the quarter since 1996. When compared with the second quarter, however, the economy grew a more modest 1 percent, slightly below most forecasts. All sectors of the economy expanded in the quarter, with exports soaring 18.2 percent from a year ago and industrial output rising 7 percent. Household consumption, meanwhile, rose 5.7 percent, the biggest increase since 1997. Brazil's economy, South America's largest, is expected to grow 4.66 percent this year. But growth is expected to slow to about 3.5 percent in 2005 as a recent increase in interest rates threatens to weigh on the economy. The government also revised last year's growth numbers, saying the economy expanded 0.54 percent in 2003 instead of shrinking 0.2 percent.

2004-12-01,"Arts, Briefly; Rubens's Surprise","When the Prado in Madrid restored Rubens's ""Adoration of the Magi,"" below, experts found a few surprises. The Flemish master, it turned out, revised the painting some 20 years after he first executed it, in 1609, adding a self-portrait and changing the Virgin's posture. The discovery prompted the museum to organize an exhibition, which opened yesterday, on the evolution of Rubens's style. The show features a radiographic study showing how the painting looked before Rubens's revisions and has original sketches and an anonymous copy of the 1609 version. The most significant changes in the painting were made to the Virgin, whose beauty ""is more natural and more modest in the definitive version,"" said the exhibition's curator, Alejandro Vergara. Her cloak was also transformed from a soft pink to a bolder red and blue. Rubens revised the painting during his second trip to Spain, from 1628 to 1629. The exhibition runs through Feb. 27.

CBS narrowly won the overnight Nielsen ratings overall, however, with ""NCIS,"" ""The Amazing Race"" and ""Judging Amy.""

After the publication of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1966, Capote decided not to return to the apartment and told the landlord that he was abandoning any possessions there. The box was rescued by the housesitter, whose relative has now consigned several manuscripts for sale.

Many items were sold to Russian collectors hungry for works that were taken from the country after the Russian Revolution. Christie's said that it set a record for the sale of a 19th-century Russian painting, with two works that each exceeded £1 million (about $1.9 million): ""Study of a Family Portrait"" by Ilya Repin, and ""St. Isaac's on a Frosty Day,"" above, by Ivan Aivazovsky. The new breed of collectors first gained a reputation for deep-pocketed boldness in February when the industrialist Viktor Vekselberg pre-empted Sotheby's auction of Malcolm Forbes's Fabergé collection by buying his entire collection for more than $90 million. Christie's two Russian auctions on Tuesday totaled nearly $23 million. The auctions continued at Sotheby's on Wednesday and Thursday, with paintings, Fabergé objects, books and other items; Wednesday's sales alone came to more than $17.6 million. A newly opened auction house devoted to Russian art, MacDougall's, also had sales this week.

2004-12-03,'STAGING HAPPINESS',"After Stalin came to power in 1924, Soviet spinmeisters began to have a field day with make-believe. Their job was to convince humanity that production hummed at farms and factories; that worker morale was high; that the Soviet Army was invincible; in short, that the Soviet Union was the best of all possible worlds. An effective means of making fiction look like fact was photography, already a medium that had been used by avant-garde artists for their own aesthetic purposes. Now it was being manipulated to serve the government's as well. There were plenty of talented photographers to call on, among them the great Aleksandr Rodchenko. This show of more than 30 Soviet propaganda photographs, mostly from the 1930's, gives a good account of how photographic subjects were stage-managed by lensmen themselves, or adjusted later, by retouching, montaging, overpainting and airbrushing, all in the cause of glorifying the Soviet enterprise. The well-selected, heroic-looking soldiers of ""An Oath, Red Square, Moscow"" (1936), above, by Rodchenko, are tightly ranked under a banner proclaiming ""Workers of the World Unite!"" Arkady Shaiket's heroic image of a parachutist, Katya Melnikov (1934), in the cockpit of her plane glamorizes the new Soviet Woman. Smiling workers! Stalwart soldiers! Devoted families! Intrepid athletes! And a fearless, benign father uniting them. These are some of the carefully contrived images that make this show a tribute to the talent of Soviet photographers even as it reveals their complicity in Stalin's big lie.(Nailya Alexander Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, through Dec. 30; free.)

2004-12-03,World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Steel Shortage At Carmaker,"Nissan Motor may have to curb vehicle production again in March, after a temporary plant closing this month, because of a shortage of steel, the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said. In total, Nissan may be forced to reduce its production by as many as 40,000 vehicles because of the tight steel supplies, a loss that would reduce the company's profit by as much as 16 billion yen ($155 million), Mr. Ghosn said. Nissan has not been able to get enough steel because of higher-than-expected sales of some of its cars and because strong demand in China has left many steel makers with little capacity to raise output. Mr. Ghosn predicted that other Japanese automakers might also face shortages in March, typically the peak month for auto production in Japan.

2004-12-03,ISIS,"This band specializes in long, loud, slow-building songs that borrow everything from metal except the heaviness: even the chugging guitars are surprisingly light, providing just enough thrust to help the music hover in midair. In October Isis released an engrossing new CD, ""Panopticon"" (Ipecac), featuring seven of the band's subtlest compositions so far. The sounds never stop swelling and fading and shapeshifting, but somehow, the mood stays almost supernaturally constant: the loudest passages feel profoundly peaceful, and the quietest passages feel secretly furious. Also on the bill: Tim Hecker, an equally subtle Montreal-based electronic producer who has (for the moment) abandoned rhythmic tracks to focus on texture. Last year, he released ""Radio Amor"" (Mille Plateaux), a disc united by disintegrating piano chords, inspired by an encounter with a Honduran shrimp-boat captain named Jimmy.

2004-12-03,A.B.T. STUDIO COMPANY,"Here's a troupe that encourages discoveries. Each year, the Studio Company, American Ballet Theater's second company, trains 12 talented young dancers and presents them in old works and new. Then those dancers go on either to Ballet Theater or to other organizations and are replaced by another group of 12. John Meehan, the Studio Company's artistic director, said in a recent interview that about half of Ballet Theater's present dancers have come from the Studio, including such prominent performers as Herman Cornejo, Michele Wiles, David Hallberg, Misty Copeland, Sascha Radetzky, Craig Salstein and Kristi Boone. This weekend the troupe is staging two premieres and two older pieces. Both premieres are by Texas-based choreographers almost totally unknown in New York. Mr. Meehan unhesitatingly called Stephen Mills, the artistic director of Ballet Austin, ""a really underappreciated choreographer."" He will be represented by ""Hush,"" a flowing work to music by Philip Glass. Dominic Walsh, a former Houston Ballet dancer who now heads his own Dominic Walsh Dance Theater, will offer ""Alchemy,"" to a score collaboratively composed by Two Star Symphony, the string quartet that will play it live. Mr. Meehan said the ballet concerns a man facing his thoughts and feelings in encounters that are sometimes comforting and sometimes ""a little abrasive.""

2004-12-03,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Nintendo Surprised By Console Sales,"Nintendo, the world's biggest maker of hand-held game machines, said yesterday that American sales of its DS hand-held console were ""faster than anticipated"" in the first week. The company, which gets more than 60 percent of its revenue from hand-held game software and consoles, said that it sold 500,000 units of the dual-screen device in the United States during the week after its Nov. 21 debut. The sales results may be a sign that Nintendo's record $40 million advertising campaign to promote the device to older teenagers is hitting the mark at a time when its rival Sony prepares to enter the $4 billion hand-held market next week. Nintendo, which is based in Kyoto, Japan, sold 90 percent of DS consoles available in the United States, the company said. The Tokyo-based Sony will start selling its PSP PlayStation Portable, which will also play music and video, in Japan on Dec. 12 and in the United States by the end of March.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/business/technology-briefing-hardware-nintendo-surprised-by-console-sales.html

2004-12-03,BRIAN F. O'BYRNE AND CHERRY JONES,"That men of the cloth are also men of flesh isn't exactly shocking news these days, with headlines regularly touting tales of priests who have found all sorts of ways to break vows of chastity. But the charismatically human Father Flynn -- who is suspected of taking a too ardent interest in a 10-year-old schoolboy in ""Doubt, a Parable,"" the superb new drama by John Patrick Shanley -- is no case study from the tabloids, limned in lurid black and white. As embodied with photographic vividness by Brian F. O'Byrne, Father Flynn is an affable, accessible-seeming fellow, equally skilled at preaching down-to-earth sermons and teaching kids the art of basketball. But when he speaks from the pulpit about the loneliness of ""private calamity,"" you wonder just what shadows darken his own heart. Mr. O'Byrne, who won a Tony for portraying an admitted child killer in ""Frozen,"" here presents an equally compelling study of a man whose innocence or guilt will never be clear to anyone -- possibly, including himself. Mr. O'Byrne is matched to perfection by Cherry Jones as the nun of steel who makes it her personal mission to expose Father Flynn as a pedophile. The friction generated between them gives real fire to the smokey ambiguities of this sharp and subtle play.

The enforcement officers seized documents from the subsidiary, Yuganskneftegas, Interfax reported. Yukos offices in Moscow and at other subsidiaries have been raided repeatedly over the last year in connection with federal prosecutors' investigation into government claims for more than $24 billion in back taxes owed by the oil giant. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, on a three-day visit to India, said the Russian government would welcome a bid by companies in India to buy assets of Yuganskneftegas. A 77 percent stake in the subsidiary is to be auctioned on Dec. 19 to help Yukos pay back taxes. The Indian oil minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, above, said Mr. Putin ""welcomed bids by Indian firms, either on their own or in collaboration with Russian firms,"" Reuters reported. Erin E.

Luciano Pavarotti, left, announced this week that he would end his 43-year career in opera with a 40-city world tour, though he says he will do no more than two or three concerts a month. ""He doesn't go on the road like the Stones or Paul McCartney or Madonna for a slog of 40 days, because he's taking care of his voice,"" said Terri Robson, his manager. That voice will be under exclusive contract for the duration of the tour to the British producer Harvey Goldsmith, who is to announce the tour's details next month, Ms. Robson said. She added that the tour would probably go beyond Mr. Pavarotti's 70th birthday on Oct. 12 and denied reports that he would stop singing altogether on that date. Still, like his friend Eric Clapton, who vowed to retire from touring in 2001, only to hit the road again in June, or Cher, whose farewell tour, begun in 2002, is expected to go on until at least March, Mr. Pavarotti's star may not burn out anytime soon.

The friends, including the policeman (Kevin Bacon) on the case, begin to suspect a connection. And that leads to tragedy.

I mean underground. This was the year of art and archaeology, when scholars and institutions went down like Dante to the underworld, and emerged with dazzling objects and insights -- notes from underground. You could almost hear the tectonic shifts as old ideas of the clash of civilizations yielded to a fresh understanding of how cultures borrow from one another to create new aesthetic syntheses -- and vivid books for the holidays.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/books/review/the-year-of-art-and-archaeology.html

The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of a gifted leader, treasured friend and generous benefactor, Julius Koppelman. Julius, an AJC Honorary Vice President, and his beloved late wife Dorothy were longtime members of the AJC family, serving on our National Board of Governors, National Leadership Council and Horizon Society. In honor of their 50th wedding anniversary in 1993, they endowed AJC's Julius and Dorothy Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations to help build stronger bonds of friendship and understanding between our communities. We were proud to honor Julius with AJC's Avraham Harman Award in 2001. A man of great integrity and gentility, Julius supported, in word and deed, a host of meaningful causes and did so always with a quiet grace and kind heart. His passion for Israel and for the physical, social and spiritual well-being of the Jewish people was boundless. Indeed, he left this world a brighter and more hopeful place than he found it and his legacy of goodness will long be remembered. We send our deepest condolences to his four daughters and their families, and to all who grieve the passing of this extraordinary man. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec. Dir.

It may have cost Veronica $1,600 to do this bit of surfing-that's the fee she would collect that afternoon in Los Angeles after modeling for Union Bay jeans, J. Crew, Sunglass Hut, or any other company that was seeking a knockout blonde with the Southern California surfer look. Veronica Kay was certainly that: she had won Seventeen magazine's New Star Showcase (supermodel Niki Taylor got her start in the same contest), and was already the star of modeling sessions in Tahiti for Wave Action magazine and heading for Bali in May for another shoot. Kay was also a ranked surfer, obsessed with the waves since the age of thirteen, winning at the end of her sophomore year her first national competition at Trestles, a surf spot near San Clemente.

2004-12-06,QUICK BITE/Teaneck; Smoky and the Brisket,"If you're looking for that unmistakable smoky meat flavor of real down-home cooking, Stickey's B.B.Q. is your kind of joint. It was opened last April by Larry Hage, an award-winning pit master on the barbecue circuit, who started his first restaurant in Cortland, N.Y., in 1996 and cut his barbecue teeth at Bubba's in Austin, Tex. Stickey's evokes a kitschy, Disney-like country jamboree, with its rustic paneling, corrugated-tin ceiling and craft-fair folk art on the walls. The restaurant is aptly named, as the rolls of paper towels on the tables, along with an ample supply of Wet Naps, portend the shirt-staining meal to come. But unlike the oven-baked ""barbecue"" served at many New Jersey restaurants, Stickey's serves the genuine article. The meat is slow-cooked up to 12 hours in specially designed smokers that burn white oak and cherry wood logs.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/nyregion/quick-biteteaneck-smoky-and-the-brisket.html

2004-12-06,Smashing Posters,"The vibrating colors and illegible typographic lettering of psychedelic concert posters in the late 60's gave us a universal graphic language for the hippie sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll era. Posters were designed to advertise bands, appeal to aficionados and offend everyone else. Hip-capitalist entrepreneurs, however, quickly reduced real psychedelia to a youth-culture style that sold everything from tie-dyed neckties to Volkswagen vans. The coffin was nailed when psychedelic lettering popped up on TV in the logo for ""The Dating Game."" An era was over. What came next, in the 70's, was punk music -- and an anarchic graphic sensibility typified by D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself), a deliberately clumsy hodgepodge of images that were cut and pasted and frequently stolen and photocopied. Punk was known for its ransom-note aesthetic, introduced by Jamie Reid on his record sleeves for the Sex Pistols; this stuff broke the tenets of legibility but telegraphed clear-coded messages to its audience. In the years since, rock posters have come to embrace a wide range of raucous comic styles and typographies -- as well as frequent parodying of, and homages to, passé fashions (including psychedelics) -- intended to convey moods and make statements that are often satirically political.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/books/review/smashing-posters.html

2004-12-06,Singing Badly Well,"As heard on recordings like ""Murder on the High C's,"" the amateur soprano Florence Foster Jenkins (1868-1944) had one of the worst voices ever put before the public, sounding more like a barnyard of sick animals than a music teacher from Philadelphia. Still, Jenkins achieved a kind of camp fame for her private recitals at the Ritz-Carlton in New York and a sold-out Carnegie Hall concert just before she died. Her career, and the larger question of artistic self-delusion it raises, are the subjects of ""Souvenir,"" a new play by Stephen Temperley that is at the York Theater through Jan. 2. In it, the admired Broadway singer Judy Kaye (""Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Mamma Mia!""), above -- aided by the longtime Broadway music director Jack F. Lee as Cosmé McMoon, Jennings's real (if presumably pseudonymous) accompanist -- gives a master class in singing badly. Here, some pointers for the would-be caterwauler.

Generally, when a famous artist passes away, the price of his or her work skyrockets. So what is happening to the work of these three photographers? Initially their works were selling ""right in estimate, not high, not low,"" said Denise Bethel, the director of photography at Sotheby's in New York. ""I do not think their passing has affected the market"" (which rises slightly at this time of year). Morbidly glamorous frenzies tend to accompany the deaths of younger artists, like Andy Warhol (59) and Jean-Michel Basquiat (27). Markets for the works of Avedon, Cartier Bresson, and Newton had developed during their long lives, their deaths were not particularly shocking and their estates are expected to be well managed, all of which keep prices steady. But all that may be changing, as the clues below indicate. ""Death cannot be factored into the estimate,"" said Joshua Holdeman, an international director of photography at Christie's.

(That week, it was gunned down by a murderers' row of novels that included Erich Segal's ""Love Story"" at No. 1, John Fowles's ""French Lieutenant's Woman"" at No. 2 and James Dickey's ""Deliverance"" at No. 3.) The Corleone family is back on the list this week in Mark Winegardner's book ""The Godfather Returns,"" which makes its debut at No. 7. Winegardner, 43, is a literary novelist who teaches at Florida State University. Like a lot of readers of a certain age, this one included, he first picked up Puzo's ""Godfather"" when he was 11 or 12 because he'd heard it had dirty parts. In a Newsday interview, Winegardner recalled admitting this fact to a friend, the writer Lorrie Moore: ""Without missing a beat, she said, 'Page 27!' Sure enough, Page 27 -- the scene with Sonny Corleone and Lucy Mancini doing it standing up."" Winegardner's book has received generally positive reviews, including the one in this issue, written by Sarah Vowell. Some readers may give Winegardner bonus points for being true to his school. In ""The Godfather Returns,"" he has Sonny Corleone's daughter enroll at F.S.U.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/books/inside-the-list.html

2004-12-06,A Victory for Terror (the Good Kind),"IN his famed study of fairy tales, ""The Uses of Enchantment,"" the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim pointed out the dangers of exposing children ""only to the sunny side of things."" When ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" opens on Dec. 17, parents will have an opportunity to decide whether they buy his argument. Based on the first three books in the dark but immensely popular series of novels by Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket, the movie tells the story of the three Baudelaire orphans. After their parents die in a suspicious fire, they are left, unaccountably, in the care of a distant relative, Count Olaf (played in the film by Jim Carrey), who, in varied disguises, tries to bump them off to obtain their fortune. In each book, the other adults in the story are blind to the count's intentions, while the children literally see through his tricks and always manage to outwit him. The dry style of the books speaks to preteens and adolescents. But what's funny on the page -- a baby dangling by a rope from a tower, say -- could be horrifying on screen, at least to the younger set. And while the books are marketed to readers over 10, the film's producers -- Paramount, DreamWorks, and, significantly, Nickelodeon Films -- will surely need to appeal to a wider audience to recoup its $142 million cost.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/movies/a-victory-for-terror-the-good-kind.html

Born in Philadelphia, Sydney attended Harvard College before serving in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1945, when he was discharged as a Lieutenant Commander. Sydney went on to graduate from the University of California, Berkley, and received a law degree from Columbia University. After a career in law and insurance, he retired in 1985. Late in life, Sydney returned to an earlier passion--painting--and experienced great success and satisfaction creating wonderful paintings, drawings and prints in his studios in New Mexico, New York and Connecticut. Sydney will be profoundly missed by his many friends and devoted family. He is survived by his beloved wife Flora, his daughter Alexandra (Bimmy) and son-in-law John Basinski of Jenkintown, PA, brothers Stark and Oliver, stepchildren Michelle Evans, Duncan Irving, Cully Irving, Fiona Donovan and their spouses, nine step-grandchildren and two step-greatgrandchildren.

A three-alarm fire in a three-story house at 976 Decatur Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that erupted around 10:20 a.m. left two families homeless and prompted the evacuation of about 16 people from two adjoining buildings as flames scorched their upper floors. Two women were injured, and one was taken to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where she was treated for smoke inhalation. Eleven firefighters also suffered minor injuries, and three were taken to Kings County Hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but fire officials suspect some foul play, said Tim Hinchey, a department spokesman. Shortly before 7 p.m., a fire broke out in a 26-story apartment building at 555 Kappock Street in the Spuyten Duyvil section of the Bronx, leaving a 66-year-old woman suffering minor injuries from smoke inhalation, Firefighter Hinchey said.

At a news conference, Mr. Morgenthau said judges should be allowed to set sentences for first-time offenders convicted of possessing or selling small amounts of drugs, and he advocated more funds for rehabilitation treatment. He also proposed strengthening the law to make it easier to prosecute those accused of being drug ringleaders. Mr. Morgenthau, 85, who has won eight consecutive terms as district attorney, may face a difficult race next year against a probable challenger, Leslie Crocker Snyder, who has criticized Mr. Morgenthau for failing to support reform.

According to the Italian news agency ANSA , Mr. di Stefano's most serious injuries resulted from a bad fall he took when the unknown attackers ripped from his neck a gold chain given to him by his longtime duet partner, Maria Callas. Mr. di Stefano, 83, one of the most acclaimed Italian opera singers of the 1950's and 60's, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, and since then neurosurgeons have operated on him more than once, said Irene Daluma, a nurse on duty Monday night. She described the last of these as a success, but said that Mr. di Stefano would remain in the hospital's intensive care unit. The Italian press has said that robbers ambushed Mr. di Stefano and his wife as the couple left their villa near the picturesque Mombasa coast.

The federation said in a news release that the sponsor, identified by the federation in an October release as Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, had not provided the financial guarantees necessary to hold the match. The prize fund was to be $1.2 million. The match was part of an effort to reunify the world championship, split since 1993. The winner was to have faced Vladimir Kramnik, the other current world champion.

In the letter, he said the Turkish chess federation was prepared to raise the money and organize the match and urged the federation to accept the offer. In yesterday's announcement, the federation did not mention the Turkish offer but said that it was negotiating with potential sponsors and that the match would occur in the spring.

""Spanish Cinema Now,"" this month's film festival at Lincoln Center, makes that point clear. The festival, opening today and continuing through Dec. 28 at the Walter Reade Theater, offers a sampling of this year's acclaimed Spanish movies that are not as familiar in the United States as those of Mr. Almodóvar, the Oscar-winning director. The festival, sponsored by the Cervantes Institute in Spain and the Spanish Ministry of Culture, features 13 recent films, like ""Te Doy Mis Ojos"" (""Take My Eyes"") by Icíar Bollaín, which deals with domestic violence, and ""La Pelota Vasca"" (""The Basque Ball""), a documentary by Julio Medem, which explores the Basque separatist conflict. The highlight is a series of films starring Fernando Fernán Gómez, right, like the 1951 classic ""Esa Pareja Feliz"" (""That Happy Couple""), by Luis García Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem, and the 1998 hit ""El Abuelo"" (""The Grandfather"") by José Luis Garci.

Elizabeth Williams, one of its producers, said ""Bombay Dreams"" would have a national tour beginning during the 2005-6 season. When ""The Good Body"" completes its run at the Booth Theater on Jan. 2, it will have played 27 previews and 56 regular performances.

Hevesi. In the report, Mr. Hevesi said the unexpected education costs, along with potentially higher expenses this year for Medicaid and for overtime pay for police officers and firefighters, could widen the annual gap in the city's budget by about $650 million beginning in the 2006 fiscal year, which starts next July. The city had been forecasting a gap of $3 billion that year. The Bloomberg administration has said that the cost overruns resulted partly from unexpected expenses for special education. Mr. Hevesi said the overruns were also due to accounting problems within the Education Department, which he said the city has pledged to fix.

Stier, also of Great Neck, with whom he recently celebrated a 50th wedding anniversary. He began his professional career with Chase Manhattan Bank and earned his law degree from St. John's University before joining the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in 1959.

2004-12-09,World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Inflation Rises,"Inflation in Brazil rose in November for the second consecutive month, adding to expectations that the central bank will increase interest rates next week for the fourth time in four months. The government's statistics agency said its IPCA consumer price index, the central bank's main gauge in setting interest rates, rose 0.69 percent last month, a larger-than-expected increase, pressured by rising fuel costs. In October, the index rose 0.44 percent. So far this year, inflation has climbed 6.68 percent and it is expected to hit 7.4 percent by the end of December, according to a central bank survey released this week. While that would be higher than the government's year-end target of 5.5 percent, it would still be within a tolerance band of 2.5 percentage points. In 2005, the central bank hopes to bring inflation down to 5.1 percent.

2004-12-10,LOUISE BOURGEOIS,"This artist's drawings have been steadily outstanding throughout the ups and downs of her three-dimensional work, and across a seven-decade career that has linked her to Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, feminist art and Postminimalism. Still, her 29th New York gallery show in 59 years may startle you: Ms. Bourgeois has made some of the best drawings of her life this year. Not bad for a woman on the brink of her 93rd birthday who hasn't left her house in nearly a decade. Consisting of big batches of small, individually framed sheets, these works have a diaristic, slightly obsessive effect. They suggest different chapters of a book, each of which worries a single repeating motif into an impressive variety. One chapter (14 drawings) is all about densely worked grids in blue or black, with brown shadows. Another work, ""Tous les Cinque II,"" holds forth over the course of 76 drawings (detail above) on red concentric circles that occasionally break into dots or fade, like a television screen losing reception. In a third chapter, red parallel lines alternate with thicker ones whose undulating edges bring to mind both rick-rack and polyps. At once seismographic and decorative, these images distill the childhood trauma (her father had an affair with her nanny) that has long fueled Ms. Bourgeois's art and often overburdened her works in bronze, marble and installation. They are stream-of-consciousness abstractions, joyful exorcisms in the key of drawing. (Cheim and Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, through Dec. 31; free.)

WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times Company and one of the few remaining sources of classical music on the air in the New York area, has ended unlimited free streaming on the Web. The station signed an agreement with AOL's radio network, which is available only to AOL customers. The station's feed can be obtained free through AOL's Radio@Netscape service, but only for two hours a day. Tom Bartunek, the station's president and general manager, noting that WQXR is a commercial station, said the Web feed cost money every year but produced no revenue and had little such prospects. Moving to AOL, which is not paying WQXR for the feed but is picking up much of the streaming costs, is a way to maintain Web streaming and attract listeners who already use the AOL service. It has also improved the sound quality and provided a stereo broadcast, Mr. Bartunek said. WQXR had about 100,000 Web listeners several years ago, but the number through AOL is not yet available, he said. DANIEL J.

Two years ago he lost a game to Judit Polgar, Susan's youngest sister. Asked on Wednesday if he had changed his assessment about whether a woman could become champion, Mr. Kasparov shrugged and said that he still did not think it would happen in the next 20 years. Judit Polgar is ranked No. 9 in the world, but there are no other women among the Top 100 players.

2004-12-10,TINA RAMIREZ,"Tiny and chic, Tina Ramirez looks like anything but the apparently inexhaustible institution-builder that she has proved to be as the founder and director of the 34-year-old Ballet Hispanico, which performs this weekend at the Joyce Theater. But underneath that bright smile and gentle manner there lies a resolve of steel. Her strength may have come from her Mexican bullfighting father or from her wide experiencing of American dance once she left her native Venezuela. Her determination has kept the company and its school going through some very tough times for American dance. The company went from earthy modern dance to a streamlined and increasingly slick ballet look. Now, the company is both earthy and classically elegant. It has also managed to do for transplanted Latin culture what others have done for black American lives in dance. One of the most moving performances of this year's Fall for Dance Festival at City Center was Ballet Hispanico's presentation of ""Desame Soñar,"" a bittersweet dance by Alexandre Magno, which the company will perform tonight, tomorrow and Sunday night in a trilogy called ""Night Club."" The choreography and performing made a familiar story live, as testimony to the vibrant contribution, largely neglected in dance, of Latinos to American culture. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7:30, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42.)

2004-12-10,SPANISH CINEMA NOW,"The title character of the warm-hearted Spanish film ""Hector"" is a 16-year-old boy (played by Nilo Mur, above) who is taken in by his aunt's family after the death of his single mother, a drug addict and prostitute. Solemn, tense and prone to fits of vomiting at moments of anxiety, Hector served as his mother's caretaker during her decline. His suppressed anger comes to a boil when his rakish Mexican father, Martín (Damián Alcázar), visits Spain in hopes of luring him to Mexico. The boy is caught in a psychological tug-of-war between his aunt Tere (Adriana Ozores), who narrates, and the biological father who abandoned the family when Hector was a child. The struggle is one of many dramas that swirl around him in the film, directed by Gracia Querejeta. The movie is one of the high points of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Spanish Cinema Now series, which runs at the Walter Reade Theater through Dec. 28. A similarly humane psychological realism informs ""Take My Eyes,"" also directed by a woman (Iciar Bollain), which swept the Spanish Academy Awards, winning seven Goyas, including best picture, director, actress (Laia Marull) and actor (Luis Tosar). The movie, which has its last screening tomorrow, is a beautifully observed story of a battered wife (Ms. Murull), whose scary husband seeks therapy for his abusive behavior and the couple's attempts to save their marriage just as she is venturing out of the house to work as a museum guide. Unlike most movies about domestic violence, ""Take My Eyes"" delves into the psychological roots of the husband's violence without sugar-coating his sincere efforts to change. It's a small, fine film without a false note. (""Hector"": tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.; ""Take My Eyes"": tomorrow night at 9, Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600.

2004-12-10,PLAYBACK NYC,"The form known as Playback theater uses the life stories of the audience to build drama, and it finds that audience in clubs, homeless shelters, prisons and schools as well as theaters. The tools are verbal improvisation, music, and the kind of forceful movement that creates characters instantly. The connection to commedia dell'arte is obvious. Commedia conquered Europe in the 16th century with its broad populist mockery of class divisions and social types. (Bumptious street clowns, greedy merchants, army braggarts, clever servant girls and sheltered but lively maidens are the types we know as Harlequin, Pantalone, the Captain, Columbine and Isabella.) Commedia troupes traveled light. They would set up a small stage in a public square, then don the masks and costumes that quickly identified each character. The only form today with that mobility and popularity is hip-hop. Rapping, D.J.-ing, break dancing: the elements are instantly recognizable So are the stories, from power struggles to celebrity gamesmanship. The eight actors (Marguérite Hamden and David Gandy, above) and two musicians of Playback Theater New York have been working to fuse commedia and hip-hop since 1998. This weekend, after a series of workshops organized by the Hip-Hop Theater Festival, audiences can see the results.

2004-12-13,"Arts, Briefly; 'Meet the Press' Meets Criticism","A consortium of more than 20 religious and secular organizations and leaders supporting reproductive rights has sent a letter to Tim Russert, right, the host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" voicing concern over the news show's recent segment on religion, politics and moral values. The signatories, coordinated by the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and including the presidents of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Catholics for Free Choice, as well as Gloria Steinem, contend that the show ""represented irresponsible programming"" by failing to provide a balance of perspectives on abortion. Moderated by Mr. Russert, the segment, broadcast on Nov. 28, was a roundtable discussion on religious and moral topics among the Reverends Jerry Falwell, Richard Land, Al Sharpton and Jim Wallis. ""It was predictable that abortion would be discussed,"" the letter stated, ""yet not one woman expert was involved, and three of the four participants are known for their anti-abortion views."" Though Mr. Sharpton supports abortion rights, the consortium argued that the discussion failed to present a ""pro-choice, biblical perspective"" on abortion. Two of the organizations contacted Mr. Russert's office on Nov. 24 to voice concern about the slate of panelists. Responding to an inquiry about the letter, Barbara Levin, senior communications director for NBC News, said Mr. Russert had seen it, and she added: ""For 58 years, 'Meet the Press' has set the standard for fairness and objectivity. We receive thousands of letters, e-mails and phone calls before and after each program, and everyone -- including special interest groups -- are most welcome to share their opinions.""

For more than a decade, the mainly Flemish region has celebrated the saint's day, Dec. 6, by delivering chocolates to schools.

Frank's book, a biting and sometimes quizzical assessment of why blue-collar voters are embracing the Republican Party, was published back in early summer and quickly went on the list. It fell off but made a comeback in mid-November after reeling Democrats, trying to figure out where things fell apart, began lugging it home from bookstores. Frank's publisher, Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company, gets credit for being prepared. ""It did occur to us that if George Bush won the presidency a lot of Democrats might be asking why it happened,"" Holt's publisher, John Sterling, told The Associated Press. ""We made sure we had plenty of stock in our warehouses the first thing after the election.""

2004-12-13,The Year in Ideas: A to Z,"In what has become an annual tradition, The New York Times Magazine takes stock of the passing year by creating a mini-encyclopedia of the most noteworthy ideas of the previous 12 months. We put out feelers, fine-tune our journalistic antennae and call on a fleet of reporters and researchers to scour the infosphere for the most captivating, baffling, promising and influential ideas from all walks of life -- not just science and technology, politics and policy, but also tattoo culture and fast-food management, horticulture and shoe design. Once we separate the wheat of innovation from the chaff of familiar notions, we offer up the alphabetical harvest now before you: 71 of the ideas that emerged -- in ways big and small, for better and worse -- in 2004. Connoisseurs of ""The Year in Ideas"" will discover a few changes in this issue, most notably the addition of the ingenious, whimsical photographs of Zachary Scott. But our central mission -- to salute the absurdly wide range of human originality and insight -- remains the same. You'll find innovations that will make you smile (""Self-Storage""), that will make you blink (""Eyeball Jewelry""), that will prompt speculation about the fate of nations (""Lawfare"") and that will inspire reverence for even the smallest applications of human reason (""The Best Way to Skip a Stone""). This year was also marked, of course, by a presidential election and an accompanying rise of interest in the social and cultural divisions of the United States; politics became a sort of prism for refracting all manner of concerns about American life.

Writers are honored in France almost independent of the quality of their work. La rentrée littéraire, the early-autumn period when the largest number of books is published, is a hagiographic celebration. Faces of authors smile down from newsstands; lines for author signings wind around a shopping mall; magazines and newspapers teem with book reviews, most of them glowing. So quick to protest, argue and rebel, the French turn into turtledoves when placed before a hardcover: ""Devour this book without moderation!"" a critic exclaims in Lire, France's best-known literary magazine. ""Amélie Nothomb is a star,"" declares a rival publication, Muze.

It was the kind of success -- more than 70,000 bags and accessories were sold in the first year -- that earns a media-friendly nickname like the It bag. Also last year, Dooney & Bourke released a handbag line that looked quite a bit like Louis Vuitton's trendy model, albeit at a far lower price. Dooney & Bourke named its new product the It Bag. The company has sold about 500,000 of these. The most popular version seems to be the one that looks the most like the Vuitton. Not surprisingly, the matter ended up in the courts. This past summer a federal judge in the Southern District of New York issued a ruling saying that while Dooney & Bourke had ""copied"" Louis Vuitton, it had not violated the French fashion giant's intellectual property rights, and could go about its business.

In this spirit, by leaving his mark on a work of art that is a reference to another work of art that is itself a send-up of a pop-cultural figure, Mr. Kantor was adding one more twist to the brief, ignoble history of artists vandalizing art in the name of art. In fact, Mr. Kantor, below at bottom, brought his own film crew to document the event. Herewith, a few colorful acts of creative destruction that artists have performed in recent years.

The first is that the land that is today Iran is the heir to a long line of remarkable predecessors. In its day, the Persian Empire was a superpower like nothing the world had ever seen-with a monotheistic religion, a vast army, a rich civilization, a new and remarkably efficient method of administration, and territory stretching from Egypt to Central Asia. All Iranians know that history well, and it is a source of enormous pride to them. It has given them a widely remarked sense of superiority over all of their neighbors, and, ironically, while Tehran now refers to the United States by the moniker ""Global Arrogance,"" within the Middle East a stereotypical complaint against Iranians is their own arrogant treatment of others.

And now these liberals have a rallying cry -- ""popular constitutionalism"" -- which appears in the title of a book published this year by Larry Kramer, the new dean of Stanford Law School. In the early 90's, Kramer became interested in the idea that the public might do a better job of protecting its rights than the courts. He became convinced that the framers of the Constitution expected it to be interpreted not by unelected judges but by the people themselves -- through petitions, juries, voting and civil disobedience. Several years later, he was astonished to find the Supreme Court striking down laws one after the other and claiming to do so in the name of the founders' vision.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/popular-constitutionalism.html

Jonathan Caouette used such a video recorder to shoot parts of ""Tarnation,"" his autobiographical first film, and he has succeeded, to an extent unmatched by any other filmmaker I can think of, in unlocking the metaphorical and literal potential of modern video technology to turn the camera's lens into a mirror.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/enter-narcicinema.html

Mr. Spitzer's report is a seedy tale that, unfortunately, will not get anybody in trouble because Albany's lobbying laws conveniently overlook such behavior. But the canal report is still a vivid illustration of why these laws need fixing -- why New York State needs legislation that lets the public know exactly how billions of dollars in state contracts are awarded, and who lobbies whom to get the goodies.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/opinion/nyregion/peeking-at-albanys-secrets.html

2004-12-13,Land-Mine-Detecting Plants,"This January, the Danish company Aresa Biodetection announced that it had produced an unusual new variant of thale-cress, a small flowering weed: a strain that turns red in the presence of land mines. Aresa scientists had genetically modified the weed so that it reacts to nitrogen dioxide, a gas commonly emitted by explosives. A result is a new way to detect mines: sprinkle the seeds over a suspect area, wait a few weeks for the thale-cress to grow and -- presto -- wherever they turn red, you have danger. ""It's much more efficient,"" says Simon Ostergaard, Aresa's C.E.O. ""It's very tedious to clear mines the normal way. You're putting a stick in the ground every three centimeters. One man can sometimes only do two square meters a day.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/landminedetecting-plants.html

2004-12-13,Game Show Panelists: A History,"Lately, the Game Show Network, handily known as GSN, seems to be taking an unfortunate turn toward modernity. Since it was created a decade ago, the channel's major selling point has been its array of old-time game shows: guessing-game shows like ""What's My Line?"" and ""The Name's the Same"" from the 1950's, and two Ford-era favorites, the Mad Libsesque ""Match Game"" and the old chestnut ""Family Feud."" But the network is now forsaking these old favorites, trading them in for late-model game shows like ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" and ""The Weakest Link,"" and some original programs, like the admittedly compelling ""Extreme Dodgeball."" It's too bad. Aside from their hosts' ubiquitous bow ties and their contestant-swallowing shag carpets, older shows offer something that seems inconceivable in today's world: the spectacle of distinguished intellectual and literary arbiters duking it out to, say, guess the identity of a pretzel twister or fire hydrant salesman.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/arts/television/game-show-panelists-a-history.html

Twenty-five years later, though, things haven't worked out as planned. American basketball players can throw down mind-blowing dunks, but leave them wide open for a jumper and chances are pretty good they're going to clang it off the rim.

Films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" below, with its brutal indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, and ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" from the generally shunned horror genre, probably owe their Oscars to the credibility and cachet they gained from the New York critics. The circle can also take credit for helping to set up many actors for an Oscar win, including Marcia Gay Harden, who was just a low-profile trouper in an art-house indie (""Pollock"") when she was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by New York's critics four years ago.

2004-12-13,Fertile Red States,"After this year's presidential election, pundits agreed that George W. Bush won by turning out conservative voters in greater numbers than Democrats turned out liberals. According to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, that feat will only be easier for Republican candidates in the future. Instead of having to rely on the same conservative voters, Republicans may benefit from the fact that there simply will be more voters in conservative states. The reason, Longman argued in The Washington Post this summer, is that voters in red states are having children at much higher rates than their counterparts in blue states.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/fertile-red-states.html
2004-12-13,Peeking at Albany's Secrets,"Every so often, evidence of New York State's grubby political subculture bobs unexpectedly into the daylight. One such enlightening tidbit arrived recently, courtesy of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had been asked to investigate a transaction in which the state sold the development rights to the Erie Canal system to a self-promoting entrepreneur for a paltry $30,000. Mr. Spitzer's report is a seedy tale that, unfortunately, will not get anybody in trouble because Albany's lobbying laws conveniently overlook such behavior. But the canal report is still a vivid illustration of why these laws need fixing -- why New York State needs legislation that lets the public know exactly how billions of dollars in state contracts are let, and who lobbies whom to get the goodies.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/opinion/peeking-at-albanys-secrets.html

The letters he had written to family and friends in the final weeks of his young life were not at all what one would expect of a person about to take his own life. In a letter dated March 16, 2001 -- the final day of his life -- he wrote passionately about wanting to pursue a degree in paralegal studies while in prison so that he could make a difference for young people in trouble. He asked his Uncle Dennis for a shipment of coffee -- and talked about Twizzlers, one of his favorite candies. He signed the letter, ""Love you, Jesse,"" and added a smiley face to the salutation.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/13/opinion/how-the-justice-system-criminalizes-mental-illness.html

2004-12-13,"Arts, Briefly; Rat Pack Nouveau Tops Weekend Box Office","""Ocean's Twelve,"" Steven Soderbergh's sequel to ""Ocean's Eleven"" reuniting, above from left, George Clooney, Elliott Gould, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle, along with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts, opened on Friday with a bang. The film, which adds Catherine Zeta-Jones to the bank heist mix, took in an estimated $40.9 million over the weekend, almost $3 million more than ""Ocean's Eleven"" made in its opening weekend in 2001. A spokesman for Warner Brothers, the film's studio, said the opening take was the biggest for any film in December other than the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. ""Ocean's Twelve"" had more than double the box office take of the weekend's No. 2 film, New Line's ""Blade: Trinity,"" the sequel-of-a-sequel vampire movie produced by and starring Wesley Snipes, which took in $16.1 million. Since opening on Dec. 8, the film has grossed $24.1 million in the theaters. Three films that dominated the theaters for the last several weeks slipped to the lower rungs of the top five, though they continued to draw sizable audiences: ""National Treasure"" (Disney) made $9.8 million this weekend, bringing its cumulative sales to $124 million; ""Polar Express"" (Warner Brothers) took in $9.8 million, bringing its total to $110 million; and ""Christmas With the Kranks"" (Sony) pulled in $7.6 million, which brought it to just under $55 million in total. Wes Anderson's new film, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" (Buena Vista), didn't have such big numbers. It made $114,000 for its opening weekend -- but in only two theaters, in New York and Los Angeles. The film will have a wide release on Christmas Day.

But Verona's city hall is not completely heartless, so as clean-up crews begin plucking off the love notes, a digital alternative is being devised. Lovers who feel compelled to share their warm and fuzzy feelings with the world can send cellular text messages or email messages that will appear on a screen inside the Capulet manor.

Joseph Picchi, a department spokesman, said yesterday that the licenses of 6,000 commercial drivers, one of several groups to be scrutinized, would be automatically suspended beginning Friday, unless the drivers can provide valid Social Security information within 15 days.

2004-12-14,World Briefing | Europe: Italy: Pope Defends Christmas Traditions,"Pope John Paul II defended Nativity scenes in public places after several Italian schools changed Christmas ceremonies to avoid offending Muslim pupils. ""It is an element of our culture and of art, but above all a sign of faith,"" the pope said at an annual ceremony at the Vatican blessing figures of the baby Jesus to be used in crèches around Italy. ""Big or small, simple or elaborate, the Nativity scene constitutes a familiar and, moreover, an expressive representation of Christmas."" Some teachers have said that they would not allow Nativity pageants, to reflect growing multiculturalism in Italy, while one school replaced the word ""Jesus"" with ""virtue"" in a Christmas carol and another said it would substitute ""Little Red Riding Hood"" for its Nativity play.

He was a pioneer in the struggle to raise professional and public awareness of the deadliness of oral cancer and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. He was a crusader against oral cancer for more than 50 years, starting at a time when many dentists weren't routinely doing oral cancer exams. Dr. Oringer used electrosurgery, a technique he invented, to remove suspected cancerous tissue for examination without the fear of spreading the disease through severed blood vessels. His 1957 lecture, presented at the Greater New York Dental Meeting, ""Electrosurgical Biopsy: A Safe and Simple Technique,"" was covered in the New York WorldTelegram ""Science and Medicine"" section. In 1964, as a consultant to St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, he helped to create an oral cancer prevention and detection clinic, making St. Francis the only hospital in New York to have such a facility. For the next 40 years he continued to lecture extensively on oral cancer at programs sponsored by the New York State Health Department, the American Dental Association, the American Cancer Society, and many other organizations. A loyal alumnus of NYU College of Dentistry, Dr. Oringer created a scholarship fund at his alma mater in 2000 so that students would be able to concentrate on their studies without suffering under the weight of heavy financial debt, parttime jobs, and other distractions.

Spano, left, who is up for re-election next year, is expected to sign the budget tomorrow, his spokeswoman said. County officials said larger-than-expected revenue estimates allowed them to avoid raising taxes, making budget negotiations the smoothest in years.

Alex Cheimets, the editor of a gadfly Web site devoted to the appliance industry, recently took note of the Thermador fridges on ""Desperate Housewives,"" and as he suspected, they are not there by happenstance. Pier 3 Entertainment, a product placement agency, got them there, in exchange for an annual six-figure retainer from BSH Home Appliances, which makes Thermadors. ""It's an inexpensive way to get your name out there,"" said Nelson Zager, the agency's president. Mr. Zager scours Hollywood lots and TV studios for scripts requiring status-granting appliances and then offers Thermadors (similar to the one at left) at a 35 to 40 percent discount, he said.

Sure, the Finnish soprano Karita Mattila stripped down to the buff in the Dance of the Seven Veils in last season's memorable ""Salome"" at the Metropolitan Opera, but that was only a punctuation mark in a performance notable for its connectedness of singing and acting: one of the rare interpretations able to make the figure of this warped teenage princess come to life. After this, Ms. Mattila, above, was the toast of the town, raising the bar for her appearances this season in a rather different kind of opera, Janacek's ""Katya Kabanova."" Where ""Salome"" offers over-the-top drama, ""Katya"" is a piece about bourgeois life in the provinces: the only thing the works have in common is that both can be showpieces for a singing actress. ""Katya"" has been underperformed at the Met, and this revival of Jonathan Miller's production is here for only five performances, through Jan. 1, though it is hardly what one would call holiday fare. Other highlights of this revival are 100 percent Czech: the company debut of the eminent conductor Jiri Belohlavek and the Varvara of a popular mezzo who hasn't sung here often, Magdalena Kozena.

2004-12-17,Once Upon a Gloomy Childhood,"There is something irresistible about children's books with under-age heroes named Baudelaire and something diabolical in that two of those tots are called Sunny and Klaus. Those unfamiliar with the cycle of books called ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" written by Lemony Snicket, the nom de plume of Daniel Handler, might be alarmed at these macabre allusions, particularly since the heroes in question are 14, 12 and a baby of indeterminate age if exceptional biting power. But it's comforting that the spirit of Roald Dahl lives and that child readers haven't been completely subjected to the tyranny of nice. Since the publication of the first book in the ""Unfortunate"" series several years ago, the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult after another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/movies/once-upon-a-gloomy-childhood.html

2004-12-17,The Listings; HOLIDAY WITH PRESTON STURGES,"Preston Sturges's most creative period lasted a mere eight years -- from his 1940 directorial debut, ""The Great McGinty,"" to ""Unfaithfully Yours"" in 1948 -- but that short time was enough to yield perhaps the most profound comic vision of American life ever recorded on celluloid. During the next three weekends the American Museum of the Moving Image will be screening eight classics by Sturges (above), beginning tomorrow at 2 p.m. with ""The Great McGinty,"" an ever more relevant fable of American politics in which an unemployed Chicagoan (Brian Donlevy) is selected as a sham candidate for governor by the local machine. At 4 p.m. tomorrow and 2 p.m. on Sunday, the series will present ""Sullivan's Travels,"" Sturges's most socially engaged film, about a lightweight Hollywood filmmaker (Joel McCrea) who embarks on a tour of underclass America as research for his ambitious new project, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (a title since appropriated by Joel and Ethan Coen). The series continues on Dec. 26 with Sturges's great romantic comedies, ""The Palm Beach Story"" and ""The Lady Eve"" (repeated on Jan. 1), and concludes on Jan. 2 with the film many critics consider Sturges's masterpiece, ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek."" A cheerfully blasphemous takeoff on the Nativity story relocated to the American home front of World War II, it finds a small-town good-time girl (Betty Hutton) mysteriously in a family way after spending a dimly remembered night with a soldier whose name may or may not have been Ignatz Ratskiwatski.

2004-12-17,The Listings; ROGER BROWN,"Along with Leon Golub, H. C. Westermann and Jim Nutt, Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago in the post-World War II era. With a deadpan, seemingly artless touch, he blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio de Chirico, Grant Wood, Outsider Art and comic strips of the 40's to create expansive, deceptively simple, funny and mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. One of nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 in the first Brown exhibition in New York in 10 years, ""Buttermilk Sky"" (1974), above, is a masterpiece of grid-based patterning and all-American transcendentalist romance. Under phalanxes of ovoid clouds that recede to the horizon, silhouetted travelers pause on highways passing between rolling hills dotted by glowing bushes. The air feels charged by some pantheistic immanence. Maybe the Second Coming is at hand. It is here in the gallery, anyway, in a 1976 painting called ""An Actual Dream of the Second Coming,"" in which trumpeting angels hover against swollen black and red clouds that loom over burning forests, fields where lively skeletons appeal to heaven and a cartoon city by the lake.

Dick possessed a remarkable ability to listen to others and build consensus, while encouraging debate and ensuring that all voices were heard. While we are bereft of a beloved leader, colleague, and friend, we give thanks for a life extraordinarily well lived.

2004-12-17,The Listings; 'THE GOOD BODY',"December can be cruel to the waistline. More than the usual alcoholic consumption may be necessary to endure the office Christmas party. Baked goods, lately reduced to skulking around the fringes of the culinary world, are suddenly first-class citizens again. The scale beckons balefully from the corner of the bathroom. Before heeding its merciless call, it might be wise to pay a visit to Eve Ensler's ""Good Body."" In her new solo show at the Booth Theater, which will end its run on Sunday, the author of ""The Vagina Monologues"" dispenses theatrical therapy for audiences who can't manage to separate self-esteem from waist size. Ms. Ensler, above, feels our pain and intends to assuage it. Drawing on interviews with women who include a feisty black teenager and Helen Gurley Brown, Ms. Ensler sloughs off the psychological toxins absorbed from an image-obsessed American culture to find a measure of self-acceptance. True revelations may be in short supply -- ""The Good Body"" is not the galvanizing piece of agitprop that ""Vagina Monologues"" was -- but in the dark days of late December it is not new insight but simple comfort, preferably unaccompanied by calories, that is really needed. (This weekend's schedule: tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., and Sunday at 3 p.m., Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $86.25.)

Outsiders on the hunt for the usual Southwestern signatures -- turquoise, adobe, intermingled cultures, blue skies, chiles -- often fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport, then drive right away to Santa Fe or Taos and miss an opportunity. Albuquerque has the requisite turquoise and chiles, too, and charges less for them. But more, it has a lived-in, bustling, modernized kind of charm, with no forced quaintness. Unfreighted by tourists' ideas of how it should look and what it should offer, it often surprises. There's a buoyancy to the Southwest style here, and, in a not-unrelated development, probably more resident balloonists per capita than in any other city on earth.

He joined the Rockefeller board in 1994 and became its Chairman in 1998. The University was fortunate to have the benefit of his enormously effective leadership. His quiet strength and deep integrity meshed beautifully with a generosity and hugeness of heart. Dick possessed a remarkable ability to listen to others and build consensus, while encouraging debate and ensuring that all voices were heard. While we are bereft of a beloved leader, colleague, and friend, we give thanks for a life extraordinarily well lived. A man of deep intellectual curiosity, Dick was a remarkable business and civic leader, an enlightened patron of the arts, and a philanthropist of generosity and distinction. Among many other qualities, he will be remembered for his warmth, wit, and kindness. He was a great man, and he will be greatly missed.

Dick's generosity is well documented, but he gave more than money. He was the leader who lead by example, intensity of purpose, compromise and intellectual commitment to seemingly unobtainable goals.

2004-12-20,Food Talk,"If you've ever floundered while decoding a sushi menu, puzzled over which sauce signifies what ingredients in classic French cuisine or tried desperately to pronounce huitlacoche in a good Mexican restaurant, help is at hand. EATING YOUR WORDS (Oxford University, $20), edited by the former New York Times restaurant critic (and now a book critic) William Grimes, is the culinary equivalent of a Berlitz phrase book, a handy reference of more than 2,000 gastronomic terms and ingredients beginning with acorn squash and ending with zwieback. Making for an even richer feast is Grimes's introduction, a cogent account of how we've gone from being a people who once carelessly categorized all pastas as ""macaroni"" to a nation that knows its rigatoni from its rotelli. In the main text, Grimes includes a generous helping of shorter reflections, including a lexicon of diner slang and a consideration of the hot dog. Not quite as helpful are the unannotated lists (types of sugar, varieties of tea, the many guises a cake may take), which could leave you hungry for more explication. And there are gaps. If you say toe-MAY-toe and I say toe-MAH-toe, we may have to call the whole thing off, because we're given no preferred pronunciation. Still, once fortified by this verbal batterie de cuisine you'll be able to order huitlacoche, palacsinta, saganaki and a salmagundi with confidence. But not, one hopes, all off the same menu.

Bouvard and Pécuchet (the names Gustave Flaubert gave to his two comic heroes) discovered through their friendship a common purpose: the pursuit of universal knowledge. To achieve this ambitious goal, they attempted to read everything they could find on every branch of human endeavor and, from their readings, cull the most outstanding facts and ideas. Flaubert's death in 1880 put an end to their enterprise, which was in essence endless, but not before the two brave explorers had read their way through many learned volumes on agriculture, literature, animal husbandry, medicine, archeology and politics, always with disappointing results. What Flaubert's two clowns discovered is what we have always known but seldom believed: that the accumulation of knowledge isn't knowledge.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/weekinreview/the-pursuit-of-knowledge-from-genesis-to-google.html

He joined the Rockefeller board in 1994 and became its Chairman in 1998. The University was fortunate to have the benefit of his enormously effective leadership. His quiet strength and deep integrity meshed beautifully with a generosity and hugeness of heart. Dick possessed a remarkable ability to listen to others and build consensus, while encouraging debate and ensuring that all voices were heard. While we are bereft of a beloved leader, colleague, and friend, we give thanks for a life extraordinarily well lived. A man of deep intellectual curiosity, Dick was a remarkable business and civic leader, an enlightened patron of the arts, and a philanthropist of generosity and distinction. Among many other qualities, he will be remembered for his warmth, wit, and kindness. He was a great man, and he will be greatly missed.

A native of Chengdu (Sichuan), China, Dick has lived in the US for over 40 years. Among six other siblings, Dick was son of Lieutenant General William Shih-Chieh Diao (Cmdr 95th Army, Republic of China) and Pei-Chi Chen. Dick touched many lives with his infectious smile and gentle spirit. Dick received his economics degree at National Central University in Chungking, China, earned his MS at the University of Illinois, and did his PhD work at New York University. Dick returned to China with his fiance Eva Hsu in 1950 to work at the Central Ministry of Finance as a researcher. Dick taught economics at the Central Institute of Finance in Beijing until branded a ""rightist"" by the Communist Party and sent to a collective farm as a forced laborer. Dick subsequently fled to Hong Kong with his young son and was later joined by his wife and daughter, and then emigrated to the United States. Dick was a Research Associate at Columbia University while he completed his research on two published economic textbooks on the People's Republic of China. Dick and his family then moved to the Washington, DC area where he was an editor for 22 years at Voice of America (US State Department). Dick was deeply devoted to Eva, his beloved wife of 54 years, whom he had courted while she was attending college in Iowa, and the two returned to China together to pursue their life dreams. Theirs was a remarkable tale of a life that revolved around their mutual love and devotion. During their later years, they enjoyed many activities together, including round dancing, square dancing, cruising, and mahjong. Besides Eva, Dick is survived by his children Nancy and Charlie, and five lovely grandchildren, Willie, Kelsey, Eva, Devin, and Linley, as well as an extended family of Dick's siblings, his nieces and nephews, and their many children and grandchildren.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/classified/paid-notice-deaths-diao-richard-dick-k.html

After a flurry of interviews in the newspapers and on TV, she sold a novel based on her blog to Hyperion for a figure that Wonkette estimated at $300,000.

2004-12-20,'American Brutus',"Good friday had never been a well-attended night at the theater, but on that evening, the city of Washington was in a partying mood. On Palm Sunday, General Robert E. Lee had surrendered his Virginia troops to General Ulysses S. Grant at the village of Appomattox Court House. Though some forces remained in the field, Lee had been the greatest obstacle on the path to victory. Now that his troops were out of the way, the bloodiest war in America's history would soon be over, and the celebrations had already begun. Four years to the day after its surrender, Fort Sumter was again under the Stars and Stripes. The flag raising there that day was marked with speeches, music, and prayers of thanks. There were prayers in Washington as well, but a lighter, more carefree atmosphere prevailed. There, buildings were ""illuminated"" with gas jets configured in the shape of stars, eagles, or words such as ""peace"" and ""victory."" The city's population, which had ballooned to more than two hundred thousand during the war, had gone crazy. The streets were crawling with silly, drunken revelers-soldiers back from the war, tourists passing through, and all the usual odds and ends-staggering from one bar to another in search of a party and another toast to the military victors. All things considered, maybe this Good Friday 1865 was not such a bad night for the theater after all. ",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/books/chapters/american-brutus.html

2004-12-20,Your Blog or Mine?,"One of the first sex scandals of the blogosphere ended, of course, in a book deal. In May, Ana Marie Cox, the Internet gossip whose Web log, Wonkette, focuses on Washington, published a link to another blogger who called herself the Washingtonienne. In the blog, Washingtonienne, a Capitol Hill employee, used a Senate computer to post intimate details about her experience sleeping with six different men, some of whom were paying for her favors. Washingtonienne listed her partners by their initials and occupations, from the married ''Chief of Staff at one of the gov agencies, appointed by Bush'' to her current boyfriend, a fellow Senate staff member. Praising Washingtonienne for her candor and honesty (''You go, girl!''), Wonkette identified her as Jessica Cutler, a 26-year-old mail sorter for Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, who promptly fired her from her $25,000-a-year job. After a flurry of interviews in the newspapers and on TV, she sold a novel based on her blog to Hyperion for a figure that Wonkette estimated at $300,000. Cutler's agent announced that she would pose nude for Playboy but would not talk to the media until the book was published. Her privacy, after all, had to be respected.

2004-12-20,"Arts, Briefly; A Case of Mistaken Identity at the Met","The drama onstage at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday night was ""Katya Kabanova,"" by Janacek (review, Page 5). In the audience, it was opera buffa, written in part by the actor and playwright Wallace Shawn, right. At intermission, a patron reported that someone was secretly taping the performance, a major violation at the Met, which constantly struggles against bootlegging. When a security official arrived, according to François Giuliani, the Met's spokesman, he was told that the miscreant was wearing a blue shirt. When the official confronted Mr. Shawn, who was wearing a blue fleece, he could be seen standing with his arms out, saying: ""I didn't do it! I didn't do it!"" Mr. Giuliani called the officer off and apologized to Mr. Shawn. As of Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he did not know if the real culprit was caught. Mr. Shawn, however, said Sunday that he did not remember an apology and felt ""extremely upset and offended"" by the incident. ""This sort of thing does happen to me,"" he said. ""That may just be because I'm a paranoid person. A hundred people buy fruit in a grocery store and somehow I feel they come up to me and say, 'Are you stealing fruit?""' Mr. Shawn said he also did not relish the publicity. ""It's already encouraged me not to leave the house again."" DANIEL J.

2004-12-21,"Arts, Briefly; The Year of Usher","For Usher, below, it has been a very good year. His single ""Yeah!,"" featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris, was No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart for 12 weeks, and was immediately followed in the top slot by his ""Burn,"" which stayed there for eight weeks, giving him a 20-week consecutive run at the top of that Billboard list, a record. (The Hot 100 is calculated through a combination of sales and radio play.) ""Yeah!"" and ""Burn"" captured both the No. 1 and No. 2 slots on the magazine's year-end singles chart, which Billboard says is the first time one act has performed that feat since 1964, when the Beatles had ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You."" Usher didn't have a bad year with albums, either. The R&B crooner's ""Confessions"" (La Face) rode high in the Billboard charts not once but twice: the original release of the album, in March, reached No. 1, and a ""Special Edition"" reissue in October, with four additional tracks (including the hit ""My Boo,"" with Alicia Keys), reached No. 2. The combined sales to date for the two albums is 7.3 million, according to Nielsen SoundScan. BEN SISARIO",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/21/arts/arts-briefly-the-year-of-usher.html

2004-12-21,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Graduate Assistants Said To Back Union,"A majority of Columbia University's graduate teaching and research assistants have indicated they want to form a union, the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday. Mr. Spitzer's office does not have formal authority over recognizing unions, but the students asked Mr. Spitzer's office to count the cards they signed in support of a union. The move was part of a wider campaign of pressure against Columbia. Graduate Student Employees United, a group affiliated with the United Automobile Workers, is seeking to unionize nearly 2,000 graduate assistants at Columbia. But last July, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that graduate assistants at private universities were students, not workers, and therefore did not have the right to form a union, even when a majority wanted one. Despite that ruling, the graduate students' group is seeking to pressure Columbia into recognizing such a union. Susan Brown, a Columbia spokeswoman, said the university was abiding by the N.L.R.B. ruling.

Dr. Zimmerman earned her medical degree from Case-Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1974.

She retired from her medical practice in 2003 to devote more time to the cause of international religious freedom, to take aid to those who are suffering and dying because of their faith and to specifically come alongside fellow Christians worldwide. In 1997, Zimmerman, Betsy Vigneri and Lisa Scaling founded the American chapter of the international human rights organization Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW). The group promotes human rights around the world, and in particular the basic rights of Christians in nations where they are persecuted. Her involvement with CSW took Zimmerman to the Sudan many times. Zimmerman's first trip to the war-torn African nation was made with Baroness Caroline Cox, the founder of CSW and a member of the House of Lords in the UK. She participated as a leading member of CSW buying the freedom of women and children who had been enslaved. Anne Templeton Zimmerman was a trustee of the John Templeton Foundation, established by her Father, Sir John Templeton in 1987 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. She is survived by her husband; her father; her children Rhonda, Mitchell, Michael and Renee Sterling; brothers John Templeton Jr., M.D., president of the John Templeton Foundation, and Christopher Templeton; a stepsister Wendy Brooks, and seven grandchildren.

She was among the greatest singers of the 20th century and the Met was fortunate to present her in 269 performances, more than any other opera house in the world. From the moment of her Met debut on January 31, 1955, she became a favorite of our audience and remained so well after she retired from singing. Mme. Tebaldi's opulent, powerful voice made her ideal for the core Italian repertory, and no one who heard her in the theater can forget the tremendous beauty and visceral impact of her interpretations. The epitome of the great Italian singing tradition, Tebaldi will remain a touchstone of that art for as long as people listen to opera. She considered the Met ""her"" opera house, and in many ways it was. The warmth she projected on stage added to the public's adoration, while her very real personal warmth and professionalism off stage made her a special favorite of those who worked behind the scenes on all levels of the staff and administration. We share in the sadness of her many friends and admirers and offer our sincere condolences to those closest to her. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr.

2004-12-22,World Briefing | Americas: Canada: Report Endorses Muslim Law In Ontario,"An Ontario government report recommended that Muslims be allowed to use religious laws to settle inheritance and family disputes outside the court system. The report came after an Islamic group, the Canadian Society of Muslims, announced plans to apply Shariah, a legal code based on the Koran, to settle disputes over issues like marriage, divorce and property. The report's recommendation drew sharp criticism from several groups, including the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, which said Shariah contradicts Canadian laws of equality for women. Provincial law already gives religious authorities limited powers to arbitrate civil matters, but plans to extend those rights to include Shariah have stirred bitter debate. The report, prepared by Marion Boyd, a former Ontario attorney general and a feminist activist, also recommends safeguards to ensure that neither party in a Shariah arbitration is subject to domestic violence and that there be ample opportunities to appeal decisions.

The outbreak of SARS in April 2003 added to the sudden decline in local moviemaking. After heavy lobbying by the film industry, which this month staged a large protest outside the legislature building in Toronto, the province agreed to increase tax credits to 18 percent from 11 percent for foreign films and to 30 percent from 20 percent for domestic ones, representing an investment of about $39 million.

2004-12-24,The Listings; 'LA FORNARINA',"Questions: did the great Renaissance painter Raphael (1483-1520) really paint ""La Fornarina"" (""The Baker's Daughter"")? If so, when? And who was she; the lover of this artist, famous for his womanizing; the new bride of a patron; or simply an idealized portrait of a Renaissance woman? These puzzles and more are occasioned by the sensuous painting of a half-length nude now on view at the Frick Collection. With her head covered by a bejeweled silk turban; a face distinguished by lustrous brown eyes and an ambiguous Mona Lisa expression, and breasts bared as she holds a piece of diaphanous material in a feeble gesture of cover-up, the lady has caused speculation among centuries of scholars. On her left arm she wears a bracelet with Raphael's signature on it, but the work was not listed, shortly after his death, among those done by the artist. Recent speculation has it that she may be Francesca Ardeasca, the bride of Raphael's greatest patron, Agostino Chigi, painted by the master in commemoration of Chigi's marriage to her. In any case, the painting, lent by the National Gallery of Art at the Palazzo Barberini in Rome, is shown here for the first time, as part of a three-city tour that will include Houston and Indianapolis. Whoever she was, ""La Fornarina"" is well worth looking at. (The Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 30.

2004-12-24,The Listings; 'WELCOME TO KANAGAWA',"The current revival of ""Pacific Overtures"" at Studio 54 may not be the definitive, mind-blowing production that Stephen Sondheim's fans had hoped for, but there are moments when the music transcends all. Toward the end of Act I, not long after ""Chrysanthemum Tea"" (a deliciously polite song about poisoning), the show turns gloriously playful with ""Welcome to Kanagawa."" The mid-19th-century Japanese have sworn to fend off the foreign invaders, led by Commodore Perry, but at this point -- with the Shogun dead -- some of them are having second thoughts. A local madam (Francis Jue, far right above, a Chinese-American from Northern California, looking his loveliest in ethnic drag) assesses the situation musically with an exhilarating conviction that much of the show lacks. ""When a country is in trouble/Choices are few,"" the madam sings. ""And apart from charging double/ What can you do?"" If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, especially if these strange giants have money to spend. The cost is 20 yen for music and food, a little extra for an even warmer welcome. The madam goes over the establishment's sexual menu (""That you'll have to bend for,"" ""That you'll need a friend for""), and her ""girls"" (from left above, Mayumi Omagari, Daniel Jay Park, Yuka Takara and Hazel Anne Raymundo), some of whom are fresh off the farm, soon get into the spirit of things, expressing their enthusiasm with girlish refrains of ""Yo ho!"" The number establishes that doing business can be fun, that life is all about change and that we're all terribly sophisticated about gender identity.

Protesters have urged the mayor to intervene and scheduled a post-New Year's boycott of the Castro because the owners recently fired its veteran programmer, Anita Monga, who is credited with shaping its innovative showings for 16 years. The director Philip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff"") and others came to Ms. Monga's defense as theater employees quit and small distributors withdrew their offerings in protest. The Castro's owners, Ted Nasser and the Nasser family, said the firing was a business decision and replaced Ms. Monga with a Los Angeles booker who handles 17 movie houses. Local filmgoers formed Audiences in Action to fight her firing and denounce programming that they fear will commercialize the historic art house. The group has organized a boycott from Jan. 1 to 5 in hopes of dealing a financial blow to the Nasser family and forcing Ms. Monga's return.

2004-12-24,The Listings; CEDAR WALTON,"Jazz in New York keeps shifting philosophically; new listeners trickle into it all the time from a thousand tributaries. But jazz does keep a few unshakeable core identities, and in the end they are not ideas but people: the warrior band leaders who play week after week, year after year, spreading a time-tested language. The pianist Cedar Walton is one of them. Mr. Walton, who refined his technique in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers during the early 1960's, has a style rooted in be-bop. But he never sifted out his vernacular blues and soul phrases, the licks that soften the edges of complexity. And all of that comes filtered through a delicate, precise keyboard touch, producing a chiseled sound when he wants to be loud and a nearly silky rustle when he is accompanying a bass solo in a ballad. Now 70, he brings in his trio for two weeks every December to the Village Vanguard, adding a different fourth member each week; this week it's the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring. Mr. Walton, in this gig in particular, has come to be one of life's dependable pleasures.

The choice of a new prime minister illustrates some of the reasons why: Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla leader, was questioned by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia only a couple of weeks before he was picked to lead Kosovo's government, and he may soon be indicted for war crimes. If the Kosovars want to show that they can run an independent country in which the Serbian minority will be safe, this is a bad way to do it. Yet President Ibrahim Rugova forged a political alliance with Mr. Haradinaj, and the United Nations' administrator of Kosovo did not block it.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/opinion/a-poor-choice-in-kosovo.html

2004-12-24,The Listings; NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA,"Without choruses from Handel's ""Messiah,"" alternately cheery and devotional carols, frothy selections by the Strausses, or indeed any overtly seasonal programming at all, the annual Christmastime concerts by the New York String Orchestra have become a sturdy and satisfying holiday tradition. The orchestra is made up of students between 15 and 22 who have come to New York, mostly from conservatories across the United States, for 10 days of master classes and rehearsals and, of course, two concerts at Carnegie Hall that in past years have been remarkably polished, soulful performances. The program was started in 1968 by Alexander Schneider, and has been led by Jaime Laredo (above, at a recent rehearsal) since Schneider's death in 1993. Many of the program's alumni have gone on to careers in orchestras and chamber groups, and there have been some famous soloists as well, among them the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the violinists Pamela Frank, Cho-Liang Lin and Gil Shaham. Mr. Shaham returns to the orchestra tonight as the soloist in Saint-Saëns's ""Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso"" and Dvorak's Romance in F minor. The program, which is to be conducted by Mr. Laredo, also includes Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D (BWV 1068) and Wagner's ""Siegfried Idyll."" (Tonight at 7, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $17 to $47.)

As unalike as three photographers could be, they nevertheless all worked for magazines, overlapping in the public eye for at least a couple of decades; thus they unintentionally collaborated to enlarge the public sense of what photography could do.

2004-12-27,A Full Dance Card,"Most years, modern dance fans get one crack, maybe two, at seeing their favorite companies. But in 2004, the Mark Morris Dance Group logged the most MetroCard miles of any modern company in recent memory, giving local devotees four chances to see them within city limits. (And for the E-ZPass set, there were three more, at Tanglewood and Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts and Tilles Center on Long Island.) ""We called it 'Summer in the City,""' says Nancy Umanoff, the company's executive director. The New York appearances began in June, with the company's annual season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Next it went to Prospect Park for the Celebrate Brooklyn! series. It danced at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival in August. And the following month it was back, for the City Opera's ""Platée"" performances. It's not just the company that was all over the map. Mr. Morris offered very different experiences to different audiences. He served up ""All Fours,"" with its jagged Bartok score, at BAM, and took the jaunty social dances of ""My Party"" to the park. For the Mostly Mozart crowd, he offered the formal chorales of ""Jesu, Meine Freude."" There wasn't much overlap, Ms. Umanoff says. Except, of course, for the ""core audience.""

I bought a cheap set of barbells and weights, stood in front of the living-room mirror and to the amusement of my children performed set after set of dead lifts until my back muscles began to loosen up. Then, bored, I did a few barbell curls, a few standing shoulder presses and lay on the living room rug to do a few bench presses. A few months later I was astonished to discover that I had lost fat and gained muscle. So I went looking for a gym.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/body-by-joe.html

If the deal is completed by early next year as expected, the holding company combining the two utilities would generate more than 52,000 megawatts of power, serve nine million customers and have about $26 billion in annual revenue. The deal is subject to approval by federal and state regulators. Shareholders of Public Service, the parent of P.S.E.&G., will receive 1.225 shares of Exelon stock for each share they own, according to terms of the agreement. That offer values Public Service shares at $51.28, about an 8.5 percent premium above the close on Dec. 17. It also includes the assumption of $14.1 billion worth of debt.

That's Anthony Trollope describing the heroine of his 1863 novel ""Rachel Ray."" It also happens to be a pretty good depiction of a different Rachael Ray, this one the cutie-pie host of two popular Food Network shows, ""30-Minute Meals"" and ""$40 a Day."" Ray has quickly become a food-world phenomenon -- arguably this country's best-selling cookbook writer. She has had three books in the top five of the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list this year (""30-Minute Meals,"" ""30-Minute Meals 2"" and ""Cooking 'Round the Clock""), and last week she cracked the children's chapter book list with ""Cooking Rocks."" Ray's books are like her shows: friendly and unpretentious. She emphasizes fresh ingredients but isn't afraid, once in a while, to take the kinds of shortcuts that make some foodies cringe. (Her recipe for Chicken Caesar Romaine lettuce wraps tells you to go ahead and make them with a supermarket rotisserie bird.) Ray's travel guide, ""$40 a Day,"" distills the populist ethos that helps her connect with viewers. She'd rather talk about great but inexpensive restaurants than talk about Le Cirque, she writes, because ""a television show shouldn't have the power to make one feel left off the first-string team in life."" Ray has written that her first word as a child was ""vino."" In Trollope's novel, Rachel Ray falls for a brewer.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/books/inside-the-list.html

2004-12-27,THE PUREST HEROIN,"For the second year in a row New Jersey leads the nation in heroin purity, though the purity level is down by more than 10 percent, according to a report issued last week by the Drug Enforcement Administration. In October, the state's heroin purity level was at 61.3 percent, down from 71.4 percent last year, according to the D.E.A.'s Domestic Monitoring Program, which gathers data on the price, purity and geographic source of heroin being sold at the retail or street level in 23 American cities.

2004-12-27,The Big Heat,"On Nov. 6, 1961, in the eastern Algerian desert, there was a spark and a flash and then a tremendous, rumbling growl when a pipe on a natural-gas well ruptured. More than 6,000 cubic feet of flaming gas per second exploded through a hole in the ground, and a deafening jet of fire roared 800 feet into the sky, melting the Saharan sand into glass. The fire burned so intensely that, like a hurricane, it was given a name -- the Devil's Cigarette Lighter -- and it was seemingly endless: four months later, John Glenn looked down from orbit and saw a slash of orange flickering above one of the largest deposits of natural gas on the planet.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/the-big-heat.html
2004-12-27,$50 Million for 50 Cent,"Recording artists who endorse products or license music to advertisers used to be labeled sellouts; now they are entrepreneurs. The year 2004 will be the first in four that the music business has managed to increase American album sales. But sales are up about 2 percent, a meager showing over last year's weak figures. That places high pressure on artists to ferret out other sources of income. The stars-turned-marketers range from Britney Spears (television movie, fragrance) to Lil Jon (energy drink, adult film and soon an authorized Halloween costume). But few have out-hustled 50 Cent, the Queens-bred rap star who has been striking deals with the urgency recommended so starkly in the title of his debut CD, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'."" Sources close to the artist say 50 Cent's forays into fashion, entertainment and even beverages in the last 12 months or so generated income in the $50 million range. Here's a rundown of his ventures. JEFF LEEDS",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/arts/music/50-million-for-50-cent.html

Since the early 90's, he had been exposing in the pages of Forbes magazine the nexus of business, politics and gangsterism in the former Soviet Union with an almost missionary zeal. He knew that such work could be lethal: 10 Russian journalists had been murdered in contract killings since Putin came to power. But Klebnikov believed in Russian redemption. In an editorial in the first issue of Forbes Russia -- which began publishing in April, with Klebnikov as editor -- he declared that Russia had entered a more civilized stage of development. He started telling his friends and colleagues that he was sure the lawless days were over. He was even considering moving his wife and three children from New York to Moscow. But his hopefulness proved ill founded. On the night of July 9, Klebnikov, 41, was assassinated, shot four times from the window of a speeding Lada outside his Moscow office.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/back-to-russia-with-love.html

But I doubt they gave that a second's thought. Here they play only ballads, knocking them out of the park with a grace that seems effortless.

No, I caught him on a late-night television viewing of the overripe Tennessee Williams vehicle ""The Fugitive Kind,"" in which he is called upon, somewhat implausibly, to make goo-goo eyes at an aging and desperate Anna Magnani rather than at a very young if crazy Joanne Woodward, and yet manages to cradle Magnani's ravaged face in his hands as if it were the only one that spoke to him. (Nevermind the disheartening truth of the matter, as revealed in Peter Manso's biography, which is that Brando went out of his way to reject Magnani's advances at every opportunity.) Years later, I would try to capture the combustible effect Brando had on me by composing a poem in a college writing class that transformed him into a verb. It was addressed to some love object of the moment, to whom I paid the highest compliment I could think of. ""You Marlon Brando me,"" I wrote, meaning that the subject of the poem had bypassed all the subtle indexes of wit and sophistication by which I usually measured men and gone straight to the heart of my amorous craving.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/wild-one.html

He had started playing basketball only two years earlier and his skills were still raw, but there was no denying his physical attributes. And then there was his desire: Dare's first love had been tennis, but determined to escape his meager existence in the northern Nigerian city of Kano, he devoted himself to basketball. Inspired by his countryman and idol Hakeem Olajuwon -- and Manute Bol of Sudan and Dikembe Mutombo of Congo -- Dare hoped to make millions in the N.B.A. Hoop dreams, it turned out, were no longer just a phenomenon of America's inner cities; they had taken root in Africa too.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/blocked-shot.html

Over all, hip-hop and R&B dominated radio and retail, while rock and pop appealed most to downloaders, who were perhaps attracted by Apple's aggressive marketing: songs by U2 and Black Eyed Peas, for instance, were intially available only on iTunes. Here are the top 10 iTunes downloads for 2004. JOEL TOPCIK",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/arts/music/ihot.html

Mr. Rothschild's legacy included a life filled with passion for his family, serving his community, achieving excellence in the workplace, and a desire to travel the world.

He was the Managing Partner of the Delaware office of Skadden Arps, which he helped found more than 25 years ago. In addition to being a successful attorney and business leader, Mr. Rothschild was committed to and passionate about serving his community. His community service included, but was not limited to, having served as President of United Way, President of The Kutz Home for the Aged, President of The Delaware Art Museum, and Finance Chair for Senator Carper. As importantly, he was a mentor not only to his sons, but also to young leaders in the broader community. Steven Rothschild touched the lives of those who knew him.

2004-12-27,Why Some Politicians Need Their Prisons to Stay Full,"The mandatory sentencing fad that swept the United States beginning in the 1970's has had dramatic consequences -- most of them bad. The prison population was driven up tenfold, creating a large and growing felon class -- now 13 million strong -- that remains locked out of the mainstream and prone to recidivism. Trailing behind the legions of felons are children who grow up visiting their parents behind bars and thinking prison life is perfectly normal. Meanwhile, the cost of building and running prisons has pushed many states close to bankruptcy -- and forced them to choose between building jails and schools.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/27/opinion/why-some-politicians-need-their-prisons-to-stay-full.html

""It seems that the Blair government's capacity to disappoint knows no bounds,"" he said in an interview published in The Sunday Telegraph. His remarks swelled a chorus of criticism since Fiona McTaggart, a government minister in the Home Office, which is responsible for law and order, declined last week to criticize the forced ending of the play's run at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in the British Midlands. The play, by the Sikh playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, is set partly in a Sikh temple and includes references to rape, homosexuality and murder. The theater canceled its run eight days ago after hundreds of Sikh protesters besieged the theater and clashed with the police. Mr. Rushdie, who was forced into hiding under police protection after the Iranian authorities pronounced a death sentence on him in 1989, said that ""it has been horrifying to see the response"" from the government to the play's cancellation. He continued: ""It is pretty terrible to hear government ministers expressing approval of the ban and failing to condemn the violence when they should be supporting freedom of expression. The minister is sending entirely the wrong message."" ALAN COWELL",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/27/theater/arts/arts-briefly-rushdie-supports-canceled-play.html

2004-12-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   FORD, GEORGE EDWARD","FORD--George Edward. Of Palm Beach, FL, a private investor, sportsman, and philanthropist died on Friday, December 24, 2004 at Hospice of Palm Beach County following an extended illness. He was 97. Born in Barrie, Ontario (Canada) on May 10, 1907, his parents were Thomas Henry Ford and the former Rachel Mary Jones. His family moved to Rochester, New York when he was a child, where he completed his secondary education and then graduated from the University of Rochester, College of Engineering. Mr. Ford was a leader and innovator who never allowed anything to deter him from further exploration. At the age of 38, he left his position as Vice President of Engineering at the Rochester Manufacturing Company to establish a new company when he became aware of a major deficiency in the manufacturing industry of heavy electronic transformers and generators of diesel engines while using gas and flame without protective devices from unexpected accidents.In 1948, Mr. Ford founded QUALITROL Corporation in Fairport, New York to fill that need and provide the electric utility industry with the protective devices and monitor the systems for transmission and distribution. He opened a branch of QUALITROL in Waynesboro, TN to manufacture valves. Mr. Ford bought the MICROCONTROL in St. Louis, MO, a manufacturer of thermostats, and the DYNAPAR CORPORATION in Gurney, IL a manufacturer of digital controls. In the late 1960's, he sold all of his business interests to devote more time to his love of sports. As a child, Mr. Ford was a natural athlete who excelled in skiing, hunting, horseback riding, salmon fishing, and sailboat racing. Of all these activities,the one that Mr. Ford always referred to with the most passion was sailboat racing. He started sailing at the age of twelve and was ""hooked"" at the tender age of fifteen when he crewed in a Canadian Cat dingy. (He later introduced from England the International 14' racing dingy) Over the years, Mr. Ford won countless cups in national and international waters with different sailing boats, some of which he helped to improve the design. Among his many championships, he won the Canadian Douglas Cup in 1934 as the first American to win it since 1925; the Rochester Race that covered several hundred miles across fresh water; the Isaac Bell Trophy at Cowes Week in England; and several races in the Great Lakes. Mr. Ford was an upland game hunter most of his life and helped increase the membership in the Ruffed Grouse Society of North America from 150 members to 3000 members after he became its President. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club; the Rochester Yacht Club; The New York Yacht Club; the the Rochester Country Club; the Sporting Rock Beach Association in Newport, R.I.; and the Everglades Club, and the Bath and Tennis Club both of Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Ford was very interested in good, responsible government. Among his many friends were General Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller, as he organized the industry in support of their political campaigns. He was a past Chairman of the Palm Beach Long Range Financial Planning Committee, and most recently was very active in the Absentee Vote of Republicans Abroad. Mr. Ford was preceded in death by his first wife Mary Louise Watters Ford, who died in 1970. In 1974, he married the former Beatriz Algarra-Cuellar of Bogota, Columbia. In addition to his wife, Beatriz, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Louise Ann Ford; and a grandson, Nicholas George Grant, both of London, England. The family will receive friends on Wednesday, December 29, 2004 from 6:00 until 9:00 PM at Quattlebaum Funeral Home 1201 South Olive Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL 33401. A Funeral Service will be held at 11:00 AM on Thursday, December 30, 2004 at the Royal Poinciana Chapel, Palm Beach, FL, with Dr. Robert Norris, Pastor, officiating.

Dr. Fernando Rielo Pardal, founder of the Idente Missionaries, died approximately 10 p.m. on Monday, December 6, 2004, at the age of 81. He expired surrounded by the members of one of his religious communities in the City of New York, where he had been residing for purposes of medical treatment since 1988. Although the great physical suffering which marked his last years gradually exhausted his vital energy, he kept a lucid mind until the end. We, his spiritual sons and daughters, have constantly received strength from his fragility. He has left us the inheritance of his passionate love for the Most Blessed Trinity, his profound sense of being a son of the Church, and a heart merciful towards all. Dr. Rielo was born in Madrid in 1923. On June 29, 1959, in Tenerife (Spain), he founded a Catholic religious institute, the Institute Id of Christ the Redeemer, Idente Missionaries, canonically recognized as an Institute of Consecrated Life with missions in 25 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. He promoted several non-profit religious, cultural and scientific organizations: the Idente School; the Fernando Rielo Foundation, best known for the annual World Prize for Mystical Poetry; and the Idente Youth Association. His cultural creativity, based on his metaphysical, theological and literary meditations, has given rise to numerous written works, many of which are as yet unpublished. At this time, when grief over his absence and joy over his his absence and joy over his arrival in our Father's House go hand in hand, we send our heartfelt thanks for your prayers for his eternal rest and for the spiritual growth of the enterprise he has entrusted to us.

Ms. Smith's husband, the poet Nick Laird, is collaborating with her. The musical will revolve around the three women in Kafka's life. In an interview with the British magazine Dazed and Confused, Ms. Smith said she was the first to admit: ""It's not exactly a cheery, high-kicking affair. It'll need some good actors like Nathan Lane or Anthony Sher."" Ms. Smith went on to say how great it would be if the show went to the Royal National Theater in London but added: ""God knows who wants to watch a musical about Kafka.

Armando Calidonio, the vice minister of security, said another six people were detained for belonging to gangs but had so far not been linked directly to the latest violence.

2004-12-28,Security Policy Modified,"SECURITY POLICY MODIFIED -- Reacting to complaints from women who said they had been groped by airport screeners under a new policy to search for nonmetallic explosives, the Transportation Security Administration last week modified the procedures for pat-down security searches. But a lawyer representing some women seeking legal redress for what they claim were unnecessarily invasive pat-down searches that in some cases constituted ""groping or fondling,"" said yesterday that the modifications, though they ""slightly minimize the randomness of the selection"" of whom to search, were inadequate. The modified policy now states: ""Patting down the chest area will now only be conducted if it alarms a hand-held metal detector or if there is an irregularity or anomaly in the person's clothing outline. Unless these criteria are met, screeners will only pat down a line below the chest area to the waist, followed by a pat-down of the individual's entire back."" But Norman Siegel, the civil rights lawyer representing the women, said, ""I do not believe the announced changes address the heart of the issue."" He and some of his clients have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow with the agency in Washington. One concern, he said, is that ""since many women wear underwire bras, the wand is going to go off,"" subjecting that woman to a ""degrading"" pat-down search. The agency has said that screeners ""are trained to conduct the inspections in a professional, respectful manner, while maintaining our high level of security.""",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/business/security-policy-modified.html

2004-12-30,World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Gas Pipeline To Open,"A 2,500-mile pipeline to pump natural gas from western to eastern China was set to start commercial operation today, Chinese energy officials said. The pipeline will draw gas from the Tarim Basin in the remote inland Xinjiang region and distribute it to towns and cities as far east as Shanghai. The pipeline will carry up to 12 billion cubic meters of gas a year by 2007, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission, a government agency responsible for long-term economic strategies, said at a news conference. Construction of the pipeline began in July 2002 and has cost $36 billion. The Chinese government has said it will reduce the reliance of the energy-hungry east on coal and oil. But multinational companies that were involved in negotiations to participate in the project, including Royal Dutch/Shell and the Exxon Mobil Corporation, pulled out earlier this year over concern that government limits on gas prices will make it commercially unviable. The pipeline is operated by PetroChina, a government-controlled company.

He served as a consultant on organizational design in the United States and abroad, including Thailand, Italy, France, the Philippines and Nepal. Martin Landau supported the labor movement and the civil rights movement - contributing to Thurgood Marshall's historic planning sessions for Brown Vs the Board of Education. He was dedicated to the racial integration of education and all institutions - and worked closely with Horace Bond at Lincoln University and with John H. Franklin at Brooklyn College. His motto was FDR's ""the only thing to fear is fear itself"".

One of six children who survived into adulthood, she was born following her father, Sassoon Sheena's, miraculous return home after seven years of hiding from his Ottoman captors during WWI. She was thus named ""Semha"", meaning a joyous event. As an exceptionally intelligent youngster, and a child of enlightened parents, she spent summers studying in her beautiful and beloved Lebanon, and finished high school as a top student in all of Iraq. With these credentials, at the age of 15, the determined ""slip of a girl"" convinced the Minister of Education to allow her admission to the Royal College of Medicine in Baghdad, as the first and only Jewish female student. She completed her MD, traveled widely in the region with her colleagues, and practiced medicine in Baghdad. In approximately 1946, Semha traveled to England and Scotland pursuing post-graduate training, and in 1948 accepted an invitation to sail on the Queen Mary to the USA. In New York, she was introduced to the fledgling Iraqi Jewish community, and met and married George Nathaniel, also of Baghdad. They became US citizens, raised three children and remained together until George's death in January of this year. Semha was an extremely intelligent, perceptive, compassionate, clever and trustworthy woman, in many ways ahead of her time. She was an advisor, confidant and ""guardian angel"" to very many in the Iraqi Jewish community.

But this year, something else has been happening: hip-hop and reggae D.J.'s have been taking an interest, and the music has even been sneaking onto Anglo urban radio stations in New York, Miami and beyond. No reggaeton star is better positioned for crossover success than Daddy Yankee, who contributed a ferocious verse to the first mainstream reggaeton hit, ""Oye Mi Canto,"" by the rapper NORE and the Puerto Rican R&B duo Nina Sky. And Daddy Yankee's most recent release, ""Barrio Fino"" (VI/Universal), is one of this year's best albums, a riotous disc full of techno-fied club tracks, salsa-driven love songs, even a surprisingly good thug-love ballad -- in Spanglish, no less. Tonight, Daddy Yankee is scheduled to play the Copacabana, celebrating the end of his biggest year yet. This should be one of the night's best and wildest parties.

(So many Jerrys, so little substance.) Phaedra's colleagues, who strut their illusionary stuff in a nightclub in St.-Tropez, are generally more, er, expressive.

2004-12-31,The Listings; 'ORGANIZED DELIRIUM: NEW YORK 1970-78.',"Only in the past few years has Yoko Ono begun to be fully appreciated as the important artist she is, and she's the star of this low-key but intriguing historical group show at Galerie Lelong. A multicultural artist in the 1960's and 70's, working in film, performance, sound, print, sculpture and drawing, she was doing it all before there really was an all, as is suggested here by text pieces, photographs and her extraordinary film ""Fly"" (1970-71). She was also part of a loosely knit but collaboration-intensive avant-garde. John Cage was part of it; so were Robert Smithson and Gordon Matta-Clark, who is represented here by designs for housing projects to float on the Hudson River. The fringe-of-the-fringe filmmaker Jack Smith, now a hero to a new generation of young artists, was in the mix. He influenced the Brazilian conceptualist Hélio Oiticica (1937-1980), who lived in New York in the 1970's. An installation by Oiticica and Neville D'Almeida titled ""CC2 Onobject"" (1973, above) is the show's big piece. (Lelong now represents the Oiticica estate.) It's a combination of padded cell and playpen, with pictures of Charles Manson flashing on the wall to the sound of Ms. Ono's keening voice.

2004-12-31,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SILBERSTEIN, WILLIAM","SILBERSTEIN--William, a devoted family man and a passionate and accomplished athlete, who after an extraordinary career as an entrepreneur, generously devoted his life to philanthropy, died Wednesday night at New York University Medical Center. He was 88. Born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1916, Silberstein was a 'Hoosier' at heart. He attended Indiana University on a basketball and tennis scholarship and was a key member of the university's 1935 ""Big 10"" Basketball championship team. It was there he met his wife of 61 years, Sylvia Levin. They married October 12, 1937, in Crown Point, Ind. Shortly after college Mr. Silberstein started a chain of jewelry stores. He also ventured into the real estate business. It was after the Silbersteins moved to Scarsdale in 1950 that Mr. Silberstein with the dedicated help of his wife founded Sealectro Corp., a lucrative electronic components company, which went public in the 1970s and was later sold to BICC in 1981. Today the company is currently known as ITT Sealectro. The Silbersteins relocated to Rye in 1968, where Mr. Silberstein has resided since. Mrs. Silberstein passed away in 1998. In 1985 Mr. Silberstein established William Silberstein Associates, Inc. in Mamaroneck, New York. The organization provides operational assistance to manufacturing concerns, acquisitional evaluation of companies and organizes capital ventures. The Silbersteins shared a deep philosophy for giving back to the community. The couple owns the distinction as donors of the first fully endowed athletic scholarship in the history of Indiana University. Each year three fully endowed athletic scholarships are given to the basketball players for notable achievements. Locally, their generosity has extended to the medical community. At the White Plains Hospital Center, The William and Sylvia Silberstein Neonatal and Maternity Center, Silberstein Pavilion and Silberstein Cardiology Center and the sponsored William and Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Institute at New York University Medical Center were all established through the financial support of Mr. and Mrs. Silberstein. The couple also established a foundation in their names, the William and Sylvia Silberstein Foundation, to support other charitable causes including The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the United Jewish Appeal. Above all of his successful enterprises and life accomplishments, William Silberstein always placed his family and friends first. He gave and received bounteous love, joy, and wholeness through his children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. William Silberstein is survived by a daughter, Betsy Levinson; a son, Bruce, and his wife, Carolyn; a son, Sigmund; his five grandchildren, Beth Grotta, Jill Altneu, Debbie Deitz, Michael Silberstein and Matthew Silberstein; and three great - grandchildren, Mat thew and Lindsey Grotta, and Brooke Altneu. ""I had a life replete with excitement and challenges. My success can be attributed to luck, hard work, and timing. I love being around people and have been fortunate in having in my life, my family and many good friends,"" said Silberstein, reflecting on his life in a 2000 interview. A service will be held at 1 PM on Sunday, January 2, 2005, Congregation Emanuel in Rye, NY. The surviving family of William Silberstein has requested all donations be sent to the White Plains Hospital Center Neonatal and Maternity Center, Davis Avenue and East Post Road, White Plains, NY 10601.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/31/classified/paid-notice-deaths-silberstein-william.html

2004-12-31,The Listings; JACQUES TATI'S 'PLAYTIME',"At the time of its release in 1967, Jacques Tati's ""Playtime"" was the most expensive movie ever made in France. Filmed on an elaborate set made of high-rise glass and steel office buildings, a glittering restaurant and a sleek airline terminal, it is an examination of the rhythms and peculiarities of modern life without plot or characters, and a comic extravaganza largely without jokes. Tati, in the trademark high-waters and narrow-brimmed fedora of his alter ego, Monsieur Hulot, stumbles through the streamlined chaos of modern consumer capitalism, a landscape of loneliness and disconnection, but also one that is both charming and sublime. Tati's ambitions for the film were enormous -- he spent 10 years trying to make it, and shot it in grand, screen-filling 70 millimeter, the form in which it is being shown at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. If you need a break from the noise and frenzy of the holidays -- or, for that matter, if you didn't get enough noise and frenzy -- this odd masterpiece may be just the ticket. (Today through Wednesday, Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, Tickets: $10; students with ID, $7; Film Society of Lincoln Center members, $6; 65+, $5 for weekday matinees only; children 6 to 12, $5.)

2004-12-31,"Paid Notice: Deaths   GLASER, MILES RUDOLPH","GLASER -- Miles Rudolph. Died peacefully on December 24, 2004 at M.D. Anderson Hospital after a courageous battle with cancer. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on May 2, 1925 he was the son of Dr. Oskar and Marketa Glaser, both of whom perished in the concentration camps. Miles survived three brutal years in the camps and upon being liberated in May 1945 returned to Prague. When the Communists came to power in 1948, he was smuggled across the border into Austria and resided in Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1949. Miles held various jobs in Chicago and New York City before moving to Houston in 1954 as the representative of a foreign owned steel exporter. He became an American citizen in 1955, and for the next twenty years continued as an executive in the steel business, eventually becoming the owner of Global Steel. It was during this time that he met John de Menil and his wife Dominique, from which grew a life long friendship. He was invited to become a member of the Menil Foundation Board and served as the Chief Financial Officer of the Menil Foundation until his retirement in the late 1990s. He remains the Emeritus member of the board. Miles is survived by his wife, Slavka, to whom he was married for ten years. She and his friends will remember him as an extraordinary man, filled with a passion for life and an unwavering belief in the rights of each individual. He suffered no fools and defended fiercely the principles of loyalty, ethics, and freedom. He did not bend to the particular winds of the day, but steered his own course with humor and wisdom. Those who knew Miles will never forget him; he touched us all. By his own wishes he will be privately cremated.
