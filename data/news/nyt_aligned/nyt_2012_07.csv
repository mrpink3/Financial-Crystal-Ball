They banished last season’s color, at least until a dash of pastel pink and blue at the end — and then not so very much. The suits were dead simple. The collection’s many renditions of full-cut trousers worn with blousy shirts — sleeves rolled up, some with sheer elements — looked at once macho and graceful. Military meets ballet. Mr. Ossendrijver also tackled the season’s themes of transparency and fabrics with glossy, crinkled surfaces. Indeed, few designers did them better.

He had been rehearsing in a studio with his band, Dirty Projectors, preparing for a tour to support its latest record, “Swing Lo Magellan,” due Tuesday (Domino). Lean and easily engaged, Mr. Longstreth, 30, the group’s singer-songwriter and guitarist, is a critical darling and musical overachiever who has collaborated with the likes of Björk and David Byrne. Especially after “Bitte Orca,” their 2009 breakthrough album, Dirty Projectors became synonymous with complicated, conceptual indie rock. But “Swing Lo Magellan” took a different tack. “These are songs without any context,” Mr. Longstreth said. “They’re less about arrangement. They’re less about orchestration.” And they were made with a slightly different lineup from the band’s previous albums: Mr. Longstreth wrote with the singer Amber Coffman; another regular vocalist, Angel Deradoorian, was on hiatus. “I think change and flux is a bit in the DNA of the band,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/arts/music/david-longstreth-of-dirty-projectors-on-the-new-album.html

In an article at the Financial Times, Evans, a journalist and amateur philosopher who heads the 2,000 member-strong London Philosophy Club, describes an emerging scene in which people from a diverse range of backgrounds gather at cafés, pubs and pizza parlors to tackle the great philosophical questions. He also traces the historical ebb and flow of public philosophizing, from the Greeks through the Enlightenment, concluding that “such clubs flourish during periods of economic and moral crisis.” Professional philosophers are of course still welcome, and indeed, because Evans sees “a huge popular demand for academics to share their expertise,” are encouraged to participate. Ending with cautious optimism, Evans adds that to ensure that these kinds of gatherings are “more than a fashionable trend,” they will have to find the “shared ethical commitments” that are necessary to “create genuine communities.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/stone-links-the-rise-of-caf-philosophy/

The report, which contradicted Mr. Arafat’s medical records, resurrected conspiracy theories on Twitter that he had been killed by agents of Israel or by Palestinian rivals. Al Jazeera said its report was based on traces of polonium found on his underwear and other belongings given by his widow, Suha, to the Institute of Radiation Physics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Mr. Arafat, left, fell ill in October 2004 and died at a hospital in France on Nov. 11 of unannounced causes. He was 75. An inconclusive Palestinian inquiry in 2005 ruled out cancer, AIDS or poisoning. His medical records, obtained by The New York Times that year, showed that he had died of a stroke that resulted from a bleeding disorder caused by a mysterious infection.

2012-07-05,Vain Glorious | Virtual Workouts,"I first learned about live-stream workouts when I took my first class (in person) at Ballet Beautiful, in SoHo. Mary Helen Bowers, a former dancer for the New York City Ballet and founder of the ballet-inspired isolated-muscle fitness regimen, was busy performing inner-thigh reps alongside her laptop. As I made small talk (I was early for class), I noticed that she was politely juggling my chitchat with someone on the other end of the computer screen. Soon after, a classmate warned Bowers that she would be away the following week but would tune in to her workout from her hotel room. The idea, explains Bowers, who almost always leads the class, was born out of necessity. “I had the opportunity to train with Natalie Portman for ‘Black Swan,’ and the program we created was intense and involved a lot of travel.” So to stay in touch with my New York clients during that period, my solution was to work them out online.” Like Portman, who is still a Ballet Beautiful regular, other celebrities have begun to prefer the privacy of exercising remotely. Rumor has it that Lady Gaga does her Soul Cycle spin sessions on the road via recorded classes. (Soul Cycle will have streaming content in the next six to eight months.) “It’s a new experience in fitness,” points out Bowers, who charges $35 per broadcasted class or $280 per month for unlimited access. “Not only is it happening live but it’s interactive, so there’s a social element to it.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/vain-glorious-virtual-workouts/

Not only did many of these movies (“The Wedding Planner,” “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,” “Failure to Launch”) have barely distinguishable posters and plots, Mr. McConaughey also served a constant function in them: Usually playing an upwardly mobile urban professional, he was a tanned emblem of a fantasy of modern masculinity, roguish but secretly sensitive, indecisive but (when push came to shove) true.

2012-07-06,Who Made That Cigarette Filter?,"“Moist lips are thrilling lips! Keep them soft, alluring.” So proclaimed a 1936 ad for a novelty cigarette, designed for women. At the time, almost all cigarettes were unfiltered. Companies sometimes added special mouthpieces — called beauty tips, often made of cork — for women. After all, what seductress would want to be seen picking tobacco flecks off her tongue? In the early 1950s, when scientific reports showed just how dangerous smoking could be, tobacco companies scrambled to add mouthpieces to most cigarettes, hiring labs at Dow and DuPont to design them. In 1952, the Kent Micronite came equipped with a filter that sucked particles out of the smoke — “Here’s proof you can see. . . . Kent gives greater protection than any other cigarette,” the ad read. But the Micronite contained asbestos fibers that were far more dangerous than tobacco smoke. Philip Morris promised that an antifreeze chemical (diethylene glycol) in the mouthpiece would take “the FEAR out of smoking.” And DuPont scientists tried to trap harmful particles with new fabrics, including Dacron, the same polyester that allowed for wrinkle-free pantsuits.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/magazine/who-made-that-cigarette-filter.html

Rusher — to develop a plan to draft the Arizona senator and stalwart conservative Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination in 1964. As the group strategized, Frank Whetstone, a newspaper publisher from Montana, stood up and said while he trusted White (a resolute insurgent who masterminded Goldwater’s nomination), he wondered “where the rest of you s.o.b.’s will be when we get down to that final ballot.” It was a valid question. A previous attempt to get Goldwater the nomination, in 1960, had been a flop. This time the campaign would be serious. The men in the room, David B.

This young woman’s charmed entrance into this tiny village, which is accessible only by water, captures the attention of Pasquale Tursi, the azure-eyed, even younger proprietor of an empty pen­sione, the “Hotel Adequate View.” “Chest-deep in daydreams” and also seawater, Pasquale, who aspires to turn the village into a resort town, has taken on the Sisy­phean task of trying to build a beach out of “the rocky, shrimp-curled cove” by getting wet and digging the stones out of the inlet by hand. He holds a big rock beneath his chin and watches in “a burst of clarity after a lifetime of sleep” as Dee ascends onto the pier.

2012-07-06,Inside the List,"UNEQUAL EXCHANGE: For a few weeks now, two drastically different arguments about America’s income gap have been bouncing around the hardcover nonfiction list. In “The Price of Inequality” (currently at No. 27 on the extended list), the Columbia professor and Nobel-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz makes the case that the growing gulf between haves and have-nots is a drag on the economy and a drain on society. Meanwhile, in “Unintended Consequences” (at No. 12), the former Bain Capital managing director Edward Conard says inequality is healthy and America could use more of it. This is a political dispute as much as an economic one, of course: Conard is close to his old Bain colleague Mitt Romney, and Stiglitz was chairman of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997. But basic economic theories are also at play. Who’s right? I’m not qualified to judge — I was a French major — but the books are in such perfect, symmetrical opposition that I’ve been a little surprised not to see their authors duking it out on every Sunday morning talk show. So I figured I’d give them the chance here.

David Givey, 68, who retired in 2006 — were found to have violated a code of behavior that includes a ban on physical contact, but they did not abuse children, the archdiocese said. The priests, who have been removed from ministry and may ultimately be laicized, are among 26 who were placed on administrative leave after a 2011 grand jury report found that several dozen priests accused of abuse were still in active ministry. Five other priests have been found unsuitable for ministry, and 12 others are still under investigation. On June 22, Msgr. William J. Lynn, former secretary for clergy at the archdiocese, was convicted of child endangerment for not acting strongly to keep those suspected of molesting away from children.

Knowing this, the Italian house recently consulted with its archives in Palazzo Spini Feroni in order to reintroduce a select group of crocodile kitten heels — sharp-toed burgundy pumps, slate sling-backs, emerald and chestnut T-strap Mary Janes (that also come in a maroon ostrich skin) and Regency-era lace-ups — with its prefall collection. “What I want to create is accessories and garments that will never lose their allure,” says Ferragamo’s creative director Massimiliano Giornetti, “that go beyond trends and can be used for years and years.” True to form, these low-riding lady heels don’t look a day over 20-something when worn with prefall’s chocolate pleated croc miniskirt or disco printed jumpsuit. “What really can be defined as ‘classic’ will never lose an intrinsic message of modernity,” Giornetti says.

The boxes are shelf stable, can be resealed with a screw top, and are especially handy to keep in the refrigerator for iced coffee. For hot coffee, the packages cannot be microwaved; it is best to pour the drink into a mug first, then heat. You can also throw a few packs into the freezer and use them first as chillers for a picnic basket, and then to drink.

Bush proposed (to swift and certain opposition from Democrats) in 2007; and one from Yuval Levin, in which he discusses the McCain campaign’s 2008 proposal and Paul Ryan’s 2009 alternative to the Democratic health care bill.

The logic of both is obvious enough, but since beauty counters and boudoir boutiques offer so many expensive options, figuring out what works and — most important — what’s worth it can quickly become an illogically pricey endeavor. Stella McCartney is now solving one of these dilemmas with a new line of everyday lingerie called Stella. “Well-made lingerie is key,” says the designer, whose frilly, pretty main line’s underthings already have an adoring audience. “Feeling constricted by one’s underwear just isn’t my thing; you need to rely on the quality. It has to fit, function and do its job first and foremost.” Available in August, the Stella collection includes five different bra shapes including molded underwire, low plunge cups, a strapless style and a seamless, underwire-free style — in youthful pops of electric blue or python and more timeless hues of blush pink or black — all made from organic cotton and recycled metal (for the strap’s gold Stella-encrusted rings).

Among them are the physicists Roger Penrose and Steven Weinberg, the novelist John Updike, the theologian Richard Swinburne and the philosopher John Leslie. Along the way, Holt suggests that cosmology is still conceptually stuck in its religious past, where the existence of the world is just assumed to require an explanation: “When we ask why there is something rather than nothing at all, we are, wittingly or not, heirs to a way of thinking that is a vestige of early Judeo-Christianity.” Also interesting is how the concepts of goodness and perfection end up figuring in Holt’s metaphysical inquiry: one critical modern source for this injection of normativity, says Holt, is Leibniz and his notion of our living, necessarily, in the best of all possible worlds.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/stone-links-on-something/

2012-07-11,Theater Executive to Write Memoir,"Bernard Gersten, whose retirement as executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater was announced on Monday, said on Tuesday that he would write a memoir of his 67 years in theater. Mr. Gersten, who turned 89 in January, is one of the last titans of the 1970s and ’80s, when nonprofit theaters emerged as artistic and financial rivals to commercial Broadway. Acclaimed hits like “A Chorus Line” opened at the Public Theater in 1975 and then ran on Broadway for 15 years. Mr. Gersten helped create Lincoln Center Theater in 1985 after a revolving door of companies had struggled for two decades to mount shows at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on the Lincoln Center campus. Before moving uptown Mr. Gersten helped to run the Public in the East Village from 1954 until 1978. “I stayed as long as Lincoln Center Theater would have me, and I would have stayed longer, but the timing is appropriate,” Mr. Gersten said. He is among the highest paid executives in American nonprofit theater; in 2010, according to the latest available tax records, he was paid $506,417, and he will receive a payout of $450,000 in deferred compensation upon leaving. Lincoln Center Theater will not appoint a successor to Mr. Gersten; his duties will be shared among executives including André Bishop, the artistic director, and Adam Siegel, the managing director.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/theater/theater-executive-to-write-memoir.html

The groups claim that the Interior Department failed to adequately assess the risks of an oil spill in the fragile Arctic ecosystem when it approved Shell’s response plans this year. Shell’s plans to begin drilling this month have already been set back by several weeks by unusually persistent sea ice, and the company said it was reassessing its timetable.

The pipeline spewed 843,000 gallons of oil sands crude into the river, soiling 35 miles of wetlands and waterways and sickening 320 people and nearly 4,000 animals. The board voted unanimously to accept the findings and recommendations of its investigators, which include revising the federal pipeline safety agency’s rules on identifying and fixing cracks, conducting a comprehensive inspection of Enbridge’s pipeline management program and requiring operators to train first responders in best practices for responding to spills.

2012-07-11,Russia: Parliament Ratifies Adoption Pact With U.S.," Parliament on Tuesday ratified an agreement with the United States on adoptions, formalizing an accord that was brokered after several reports of apparent abuse or maltreatment of Russian children living with American parents. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, signed the pact in Washington last July. The agreement specifies that children from either country can be adopted abroad only when it is impossible to find a family in the native country. The agreement also provides for stricter oversight and reporting requirements for adoptive parents. The injury or death of adopted Russian children in the United States had become an emotionally charged issue in Russia.  The most prominent case involved a 7-year-old boy whose adoptive mother in Tennessee sent him back to Russia on his own, saying he had emotional problems. The most recent case  involved a 9-year-old boy living with adoptive parents in Nebraska who died in a house fire in May. Russia’s ombudsman for children’s rights demanded an investigation.

The self-immolation took place on Saturday and was the 43rd self-immolation since 2009 in protest of Chinese rule in a Tibetan area, the Radio Free Asia report said. The condition of the man was unclear. Free Tibet said he was Tsewang Dorjee, 22, a nomad. Radio Free Asia, citing a person from Lhasa, said the self-immolation took place in an area that Tibetans call Damshung, and the Chinese call Dangxiong. The Chinese government has denounced the self-immolations as the work of separatists. In May, two men self-immolated in Lhasa in front of the Jokhang, the holiest temple of Tibetan Buddhism. The Chinese government generally does not allow foreigners, including foreign journalists, to travel independently to Lhasa or other parts of central Tibet. Many areas in eastern Tibet, the region where most of the self-immolations have taken place, are now also closed to foreigners.

In 1984, a sports historian named Robert Barney was exploring a Greek archaeological site when he leaned over to tie his shoe and noticed a symbol etched into a weather-beaten stone: five linked rings.

2012-07-13,This Is London,"In “Capital,” a modern offshoot of juicy social satires like Trollope’s novel “The Way We Live Now,” John Lanchester puts two of his characters in a compartment of the London Eye, the Ferris wheel that went up on the south bank of the Thames to celebrate the millennium. It’s the spring of 2008, a sunny day for once, and a Polish builder named Zbigniew and a Hungarian nanny named Matya are on a date. Though Britain is reeling from the double whammy of global economic woes and terrorism jitters, Zbigniew and Matya take in their bird’s-eye view with no special feeling of unease, apart from a twinge of motion sickness. On terra firma, both work for wealthy homeowners on a gentrified street called Pepys Road in the up-and-coming South London neighborhood of Clapham. At the beginning of the 21st century, before the bursting of the real estate bubble, property values on Pepys Road had soared — even for the modest end house, owned by a Muslim family, that holds a corner shop, and even for the crumbling terraced house owned by an elderly grandmother, which hasn’t had a change of linoleum, wall­paper or electrical wiring in 50 years. Owning property there, Lanchester writes, “was like being in a casino in which you were guaranteed to be a winner.” Lately, though, all is not well on Pepys Road. The high rollers’ holiday bonuses aren’t secure, cash in hand is getting scarce, and ominous postcards have been arriving in every mail slot, reading: “We Want What You Have.” If that weren’t alarming enough, a young man in a hoodie has been seen lurking in the dawn hours. We all know what that means.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/capital-a-novel-by-john-lanchester.html
2012-07-13,A Friend of the Family,"It takes a while for the reader to get the proper hang of Frances ­Thorpe, the narrator and protagonist of Harriet Lane’s debut novel, “Alys, ­Always,” because we meet her at a moment when a crisis has brought out the best in her. Driving home to London one Sunday evening after a visit with her parents in the suburbs, Frances happens upon a car that has flipped onto its side. She pulls over, approaches cautiously and hears from inside the car a woman’s voice — not screaming or moaning, but “a sort of muttering,” in “a low, conversational tone.” The windshield is shattered in such a way as to have turned opaque, and the injured driver cannot be seen; Frances’ image of her is formed entirely by her “expensive, cultured voice,” and by a kind of upper-class conversational refinement that even an apparent head injury cannot undermine. Frances, while neither a doctor nor a paramedic — she is just a “subeditor,” which is to say copy editor, in the beleaguered books section of a downsizing London newspaper called The Questioner — does unflinchingly what little she can: first she phones for an ambulance, and then she stays beside the car and talks soothingly with the trapped woman, whose name is Alice, until Alice’s frightened yet still genteel voice turns unintelligible. The police arrive and, shortly afterward, Alice dies of her injuries.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/alys-always-by-harriet-lane.html

Set in contemporary India, it stars the Indian actress Freida Pinto as the title character, a poor country lass who falls for a rake, Jay (Riz Ahmed). Jay pursues Trishna and then abandons her, literally and emotionally, only to return to her arms amid a great deal of melodramatic busyness, pulsing colors, churning dust and very little heat.

2012-07-13,Mexico: Runner-Up Mounts a Challenge," Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the runner-up in the presidential election, said Thursday that as part of a formal complaint he would hand over to electoral officials evidence of widespread vote buying and excessive campaign spending by Enrique Peña Nieto, who won by six percentage points. He also called for the election results to be invalidated. In 2006, Mr. López Obrador narrowly lost to Felipe Calderón and disputed the results for months. Most analysts doubt the vote will be annulled but say Mr. López Obrador’s efforts, and recent street protests, carry symbolic value as an expression of dissatisfaction with the return of Mr. Peña Nieto’s party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

He would advance not just security but also “opportunity and justice” — and “not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces.” He would send in “agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers” — a virtual “civilian surge” to fashion a new Afghan economy, train policemen and assist farmers. His goal was a level of societal coherence and governmental functionality never before seen in that mountain redoubt of a country.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html

Iris is unsure what the firm does, beyond delivering vague letters to “clients” and producing long strings of unconnected numbers. What’s more troubling is that the place seems to be emptying out around her. Co-workers are disappearing. Offices are abruptly abandoned, shut up, her colleagues replaced by piles of broken or obsolete office equipment, “things that are no longer things, but not yet trash.” Her boss vanishes for longer and longer periods, days, weeks at a time, turning up for brief interludes to perform suspicious activities — like hiding envelopes in the floorboards — only to go missing right out of his office just as Iris comes in with the supplies he’s requested.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/radio-iris-by-anne-marie-kinney.html

Still, a kind of stern traditionalism undergirds the story. When it comes to imagining the continuing lives of our storybook legends, the author seems to side with the sixth-grade teacher of his main characters — twins lost, literally, in a good book — who denounces the Disneyfication of the classics: “Fairy-tale ‘adaptations’ are usually stripped of every moral and lesson the stories were originally intended to teach, and replaced with singing and dancing forest animals.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/the-land-of-stories-by-chris-colfer.html

Finally, I broke down and bought myself a pair of stainless steel fish pliers made specifically to remove pin bones. They work wonderfully. (You can see them in action in the video above.) Unlike regular pliers, they have a very slender tip made for grasping the bones, and I can throw them in the dishwasher when I’m done. They are easier to handle, have a better grip than tweezers, and are far, far more efficient than my fingers.

The journalist, Eskinder Nega, and more than a dozen others — most of whom had fled the country — were convicted of attempting to foment a revolution in Ethiopia, human rights advocates said. Two opposition figures received life sentences. Mr. Nega’s case stemmed from writings challenging the prosecution of fellow reporters and editors. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, strongly condemned Mr. Nega’s conviction in June, saying the Ethiopian government “misuses its institutions to silence its critics.” PEN International, which honored Mr. Nega with a press freedom award this spring, said Friday that it was “appalled” by the sentencing and called for his immediate release.

He said those responsible would be arrested and prosecuted. The worst of the trouble took place around the Catholic Ardoyne enclave in northern Belfast after a Protestant parade. At least 10 shots were fired at the police, though no officers were hit. Some rioters also threw homemade bombs, bottles and stones at the police; at least 20 officers were treated for cuts, bruises and burns. The police responded by firing plastic bullets and blasts from water cannons. The annual Orange Order parades are viewed by many Catholics as provocative and often set off sectarian violence.

At a Comic-Con International panel in San Diego, DC Comics and Mr. Gaiman announced that he would write a new Sandman mini-series, drawn by J. H. Williams III (Batwoman), to be published by the company’s Vertigo imprint in 2013. Upon its release it will be the first new Sandman story in nine years and will coincide with the original series’ 25th anniversary. That series, which Mr. Gaiman, above, wrote from 1988 to 1996, won numerous accolades, including a World Fantasy Award for best short fiction in 1991, the only comic book to receive that honor. Mr. Gaiman stopped writing comics full time to focus on fantasy novels, including “American Gods” and “Anansi Boys,” and children’s tales like “The Graveyard Book.” He has returned to the Sandman only twice since the series ended, most recently for “Endless Nights,” a graphic novel short-story collection, published in 2003. “I’m excited; this has been an incredibly long time coming,” Mr. Gaiman said in the video message played on Thursday. “It was one of the few stories that actually felt, when I finished Sandman, like I had failed because I had not told this story.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/books/neil-gaiman-plans-return-to-comic-books.html

So it’s with a little wink that Judith Leiber, the legendary black-tie-bag enterprise of 49 years, named its new contemporary offshoot Overture by Judith Leiber. “They are evening bags,” says Jana Matheson, the brand’s creative director, “but they are far more versatile than the standard satin and rhinestone pouches that you carry to the opera.” The 32-piece collection of industrial brushed metallic boxes, jewel-embellished canteen satchels and elongated bow bags in colorful exotic skins inherited the distinctive Leiber DNA — compact and polished sums it up — but it’s priced from $295 to $995 (compared to the main line’s minaudières that can cost as much as $6,000). Matheson hopes that making dressier clutches easier for young women to access will encourage a new way of thinking about what they carry and when. “We have to be retrained to think about wearing going-out bags for date nights, girls’ night out, drinks after work, you name it,” she says. “We make a shoe change, add lipstick and, now, should switch our bag.” Not unlike our grandmothers before us. “They had it right!” Matheson says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/judith-leibers-second-act/

In March, two monks from the same monastery died after setting themselves on fire. The Chinese news media did not immediately report Tuesday’s death, but in the past it has portrayed the spate of self-immolations as acts of terrorism orchestrated by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.

In fact, Gray argues, Hobbes thought that human beings are driven more by fear and “an overpowering need for safety,” and turn to violence primarily (though not only) in self-defense. But even if we understand him correctly, was Hobbes right? Gray thinks that another misunderstood book, Cormac McCarthy’s novel “Blood Meridian,” might offer an answer.

Among the factors complicating an assessment: the government’s estimates of how much radioactive material leaked from the plant could change again. An earlier World Health Organization study said the amount of radiation exposure fell below what it said were cancer-causing levels. The latest study was conducted by the meteorologist John E. Ten Hoeve and the environmental engineering professor Mark Z. Jacobson, who said that deaths might have been higher if winds had not blown most of the radioactive material out to sea. The study’s best estimate was that the disaster would cause 130 additional cancer deaths among the public, almost all in Japan.

2012-07-19,J.Crew’s New Jeans,"The latest addition to J. Crew’s curated “In Good Company” collection comes from Goldsign, the Los Angeles jeans brand founded by the denim industry’s designer-guru Adriano Goldschmied. The item: a classic five-pocket called Jenny made of selvage denim that is “in between a sexy jean and a boyfriend jean,” Goldschmied says. Available in two washes — a dark vintage and a lighter shade with a green cast — the one-year-old style was originally inspired by a pair worn by Norma Jeane Baker in photographs taken by André de Dienes in the 1940s. Just like those jeans, the Jenny has a straight side seam, a high waist and a cuff (that’s easy to undo, as shown here). “Back then women were buying men’s jeans and rolling them up,” Goldschmied explains. “I was in some way a little bit tired of the skinny that was born in L.A. and that’s been very successful. I was looking for what’s next. My way of designing is about starting from something that’s part of a tradition and not just replicating it but innovating through fabric, fit and wash.” It’s a lot like what J. Crew does with American classics like striped tees and khakis: it twists and turns them through styling into more forward-thinking fashion. “J. Crew and I have a lot of things in common,” Goldschmied acknowledges.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/j-crews-new-jeans/

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the waivers relieve states from “well intentioned but burdensome requirements” of the law, particularly the condition requiring that every student be proficient in math and reading by 2014. The states granted waivers were Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and South Carolina, as well as the District of Columbia; 32 waivers have now been granted. The law has been up for reauthorization since 2007, but Congress has so far not acted on a new version.

A remake of a 1940 film by Marcel Pagnol, it turns on a humble young woman, Patricia (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), who’s literally swept off her feet and across a stream by a grocer’s son, Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle). By the time he puts her down, their lives have inexorably changed and she seems on her way to becoming one of fiction’s female martyrs, an innocent sacrificed on the altar of social hypocrisy and an authorial need to lecture on such hypocrisy.

Mailer’s very titles — “Advertisements for Myself,” “An American Dream” — told us he was on a mission, committed to the transformation of country and self, and even as he gave himself over to unremittingly private (and epic) meditations on God, the Devil, cancer and plastics, he was also determined to remake the civic order. He ran for mayor of New York City, he tried his hand at directing movies and in 1955 he helped start an alternative weekly known as The Village Voice. Part of the exhilaration of Mailer was that he cared so ravenously even when he failed; he was shooting for the moon even when he shot himself in the foot.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/books/review/a-hologram-for-the-king-by-dave-eggers.html

2012-07-20,Rainbow Merit Badge,"WITH more and more American institutions becoming inclusive and even openly gay-friendly, the Boy Scouts of America has just reaffirmed its unregenerate straights-only status: a special committee, formed in 2010, recently announced the organization’s intention of sticking with the 2000 Supreme Court decision that it is within its constitutional rights to exclude gays from leadership roles. All this is richly ironic in view of the fact that the founder of the Boy Scouts, Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell (raised to the peerage as Lord Baden-Powell) was in probability a gay man himself — though closeted, of course, considering the circumstances. A Victorian military hero who skyrocketed to fame after his valiant defense of the besieged city of Mafeking during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was one of the British Empire’s most adulated soldiers, looked to as the very model of muscular Christianity. Baden-Powell, the author of the hugely popular and influential “Scouting for Boys” (1908), inspired a national cult of manliness even as he entertained serious worry about his own sexuality.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/opinion/scoutings-gay-founder.html

The dosimeter used A-weighting, which mimics the human ear’s sensitivity to sound at various frequencies. The machine was set up to log multiple types of doses based on standards set by the government: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. The device was carried at chest height — it was never held up to speakers or other noise sources to amplify readings — and measured noise exposure for periods from 20 minutes to 8 hours.

2012-07-20,Tennessee: More Delays for Permitting of Mosque," An Islamic group that has faced lawsuits, vandalism and anti-Muslim threats will not be able to move into its new mosque in Murfreesboro this week as planned, its leaders said Thursday. Members had hoped to move in for the holy month of Ramadan as it began this week. But the mosque’s opening will be delayed until it passes a building inspection and gets its occupancy permit. For two years, construction of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro’s 12,000-square-foot mosque has been a heated issue in the central Tennessee city. In May, a judge voided the approval for construction of the mosque, saying the Rutherford County Planning Commission did not adequately inform the public of a meeting when it approved the plan for the mosque. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order allowing the congregation to begin using the mosque pending an inspection. “It is unfortunate that we cannot be in our building for the start of Ramadan tonight,” the mosque’s leaders said in a written statement. “However, it does look like we will get to enjoy most of Ramadan in our building, especially the breaking of the fast at the end of Ramadan, on Eid-ul-Fitr.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/us/tennessee-more-delays-for-permitting-of-mosque.html

Along with running the Strand Theater in Baltimore, Ms. Pryor, 43, performs stand-up and stars in an autobiographical solo show, “Fried Chicken and Latkes,” which returned to New York on Saturday. Ms. Carlin, 49, starred in her own solo show, “A Carlin Home Companion,” and hosts a Sirius radio show featuring comics.

A Republican vote against extending the nation’s borrowing authority would risk a financial-market meltdown, she insisted; her colleague replied that the risks were justified. “We’ve spent way too much money,” he told her.

2012-07-20,Generation O,"This book gives us the story of the new Democratic foreign policy elite, mostly obscure Washingtonians raised up by President Obama to be his loyalists, along with a few luminaries to protect him politically. The people at the inner core need to be more widely known because they will hover for decades to tutor future Democratic leaders and hound Republicans. The most trusted of them occupy key slots on the National Security Council staff, while the next tier fill top positions in the Defense and State Departments. They are centrists, not ideologues like the neoconservative Republicans who preceded them. Strikingly, however, they do not cling religiously to the middle ground come what may. Rather, they regard the center as a jumping-off point for complicated and often contradictory positions. In “The Obamians,” James Mann tells us who they are, what they think and how they use power.

When cooked by mad word scientists like Glen Duncan — whose new horror novel, “Talulla Rising,” is a sequel to “The Last Werewolf” — this harmonic hybrid delivers sweet (plot), salty (character), sour (emotional pathos), bitter (psychological probity) and umami (stylistic and linguistic panache).

He had been a professional opera singer, and a racer of fast boats and faster cars. But according to his own father, whom he often referred to as “Nabokov,” he had also been — perhaps above all else in the end — his “best translator,” devoting the last two decades of his life to translating his father’s earlier work from Russian to English and Italian.

Since mid-April, cholera has killed an additional 400 Haitians and sickened 50,000 more, according to Haitian government statistics. This brings the official death toll to 7,442 and the caseload to 580,947 since the first cases were detected in October 2010.

2012-07-23,The Politics of “The Dark Knight Rises”,"In addition to effectively exploring the anxieties of a civilization threatened more by nihilists and world-burners than by traditional geopolitical rivals, Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy is notable for being much more explicitly right-wing than almost any Hollywood blockbuster of recent memory. I had thought that some of the conservative attempts to claim 2008’s “The Dark Knight” as a brief for the Bush-era War on Terror were overdrawn, but after watching the final movie’s faux-revolutionary villain appropriate the themes and exploit the grievances of the Occupy Wall Street movement in order to launch a 21st century Reign of Terror, I don’t really think the saga’s rightward political tilt can be denied. And it’s a testament to how rarely one sees that political tilt in American cinema, I suspect, that the mere existence of conservative themes in a major summer movie has inspired extraordinary overreactions from ideologically-inclined movie writers.

Much of that discussion has centered on the debt owed to those who have served, and the moral obligation of a grateful nation to repay that debt. To be clear, it’s a debt both real and owed. However, to suggest that efforts to support our veterans with meaningful jobs and education is based solely on repaying a debt is both limiting and dangerous. Instead, it’s critical for policy makers, politicians and, most importantly, the American public to understand that the support and care of wounded warriors, veterans and military families represent a compelling national security imperative.

2012-07-26,Gaza: Fears of Economic Isolation," The United Nations’ top Middle East diplomat expressed growing concern on Wednesday about the precarious finances of the Palestinian Authority and the economic isolation of Gaza. The diplomat, Robert H. Serry, special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told the Security Council that the Palestinian Authority “faces an acute challenge in maintaining its solvency” and noted its late payment of government salaries. Mr. Serry also said that during a visit this month to Gaza, which is run by the anti-Israeli militant group Hamas, he was “struck by the fragility and unsustainability of the present situation.” His assessment, part of a broader appraisal that held out little hope for renewed Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, coincided with the release of a World Bank report that said the Palestinian Authority was facing the worst financial crisis since its founding in 1994 and was not ready to support statehood, partly because of an over-reliance on foreign aid. “It is critical for the Palestinian Authority to increase trade and spur private sector growth,” the report said. It also said Israeli security restrictions on the Palestinian territories “continue to stymie investment.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/world/middleeast/gaza-fears-of-economic-isolation.html

Most Iranians who go overseas will no longer be allowed to trade their rials for dollars at the artificially low official rate. Those embarking on religious pilgrimages abroad are exempt from the restrictions, the Central Bank said. The announcement added to economic pressures confronting Iranians because of the sanctions, which have contributed to steep inflation and caused shortages of foreign goods. The price of chicken, a staple of the Iranian diet, has surged in the past few months, partly because of difficulties in securing imported feed. The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Shahbaz Hasanpur, a member of Parliament’s Planning and Budget Committee, as saying new measures would stabilize the price of chicken and other basic goods in coming days.

And in any case, take it from a social conservative with a fair amount of experience in potentially lost causes: When you find yourself on the losing side of an argument that you used to be winning, accusing your opponents of being lunatics and nihilists isn’t usually the ideal way to turn the tide.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/on-gun-control-and-prohibition/

After 20 minutes, she pulled into a pebbly driveway.

2012-07-27,Now Collaborating | VPL + Anthropologie,"VPL designer Victoria Bartlett is giving girls one very good reason to keep investing in summer clothes: a new collaborative inner-as-outer wear collection with Anthropologie called UV_UnderVisibles. Inspired by the work of the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher, Bartlett created an 18-piece collection starring six subtle micro-prints — a definite departure from her own large-scale graphics. “We had never worked with such small patterns for VPL, so it was quite exciting,” says the designer, who, in some cases, downsized and softened her main line’s bigger patterns to make sweeter ones, like the pink and melon repeat on a bra and high-waisted underpant set. “We found this type of print really worked with the sporty energy of the UV line.” Indeed, though cheerful and pretty, the pieces also hit an athletic note with a price point that will please a young shopper’s budget. Bras and underwear start at $68 and $48; chemises and camisoles go for $128 and $98, respectively. As one of Anthropologie’s monthly collaborations with independent designers, the collection will be available online for under 10 weeks after its July 30 unveiling. “It’s based in the roots of VPL, which lie in the desire to bridge the gap between inner and outerwear,” Bartlett says. Given recent temperatures, we might lean toward wearing it like the latter.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/now-collaborating-vpl-anthropologie/

Auden: “Form looks for content, content looks for form.” It’s a pithy bit of near tautology that also happens to neatly describe Skinner’s thoughtful and genre-defying book. Skinner has not led a typical poet’s life, to the extent that there is such a thing. Raised in the quintessentially American working-­class enclave of Levittown, on Long Island, he spent many years as a private investigator before landing, later in life than most professional poets, in academia. His book — at once a memoir, how-to, advice column, stand-up act, confession and, most of all, ode to the art form — edifies and entertains while reflecting on the unexpected turns that poets’ lives are bound to take.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/books/review/the-6-5-practices-of-moderately-successful-poets-by-jeffrey-skinner.html

Federal prosecutors began investigating the Seattle Police Department after the fatal shooting of a homeless Native American woodcarver in 2010 led to a public outcry and accusations that the department was out of control. Investigators said they had found that the Seattle police had engaged in excessive force that violated federal law and the Constitution. Under the agreement, officers will receive training in avoiding bias, in conducting stops and in the use of force. The department also will be required to develop more specific policies on what constitutes biased policing and better reporting when such episodes do occur.
