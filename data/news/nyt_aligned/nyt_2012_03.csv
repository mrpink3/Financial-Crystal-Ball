It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scene, since Jonathan is played by Robert De Niro, the most famous taxi driver in movies. “Being Flynn” is a much milder movie than “Taxi Driver,” pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas, but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro’s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.

Part of it has to do with a studio tendency toward surf tropes and clichés (“Cowabunga!” “Hang Ten!”). More of it has to do with the nature of the sport itself: it breeds localism. Not just the xenophobic, occasionally violent expressions of localism that enforce the pecking order, but, more prevalent, a fierce love of place. To learn the personality of a particular wave is to become intimate with the contours of a landscape, to map that landscape and make it yours. Surfers will say that the character of a break influences the local culture. In other words, a filmmaker who wishes to get a surf spot right by its locals has his work cut out for him.

2012-03-02,Fantasy Focus: Early Spring Notes,"The big news of the week was the Astros’ curious decision to shift Brett Myers from the rotation to the closer role. This has already been dissected at length, so I’ll keep it short, but while Myers is a No. 3 starter at best in terms of talent, he threw 439 innings over the past two years for Houston and that has a lot of value, particularly in keeping the bullpen fresh. It’s also curious given that the Astros actually have some talent in the bullpen: David Carpenter, Wilton Lopez, Juan Abreu (12.0 K/9IP in Class AAA), and yes, even Brandon Lyon. Either way, this is really about the future for Houston, which apparently feels that to a contender at the trade deadline, a shut-down reliever has more value than a No. 3 or 4 starter. The Astros may be right there, but this does nothing but make it more likely that Houston drafts No. 1 over all in the 2013 draft.",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/fantasy-focus-early-spring-notes/

Like Dermont’s book, it also delved into the confused and sometimes reckless lives of adolescent boys. “One of the things that most impresses me in ‘The Starboard Sea’ is Dermont’s access into the experience of a teenage boy,” Henderson said in a recent e-mail. “I tend to be annoyed when readers get excited by a writer who ‘crosses over’ into a character of the opposite gender, as though the opposite gender is some unidentified species or something. But Dermont’s commitment to seeing the world through a boy’s eyes seems complete to me, and I think it’s because of her powerful crush on her own narrator, Jason. I feel the same way about Jude, the 16-year-old protagonist of my novel — in high school, I would have liked to have a boyfriend like him, as screwed up as he is. All writers should be a little in love with their characters, I think. Because Dermont was, I fell for Jason, too.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/books/review/up-front.html

In fact, posterity has occasionally hinted that Adams was partly responsible for Clover’s death, as if omitting her from “The Education” suggests guilt rather than a surfeit of feeling. Adams did tell a friend that the “great calamities in life leave one speechless,” and three years after Clover died he wrote that he was still “sad, sad, sad.” He then burned some of the diaries he kept during his marriage. If Clover left a suicide note, he must have burned that too. “Wisdom,” he declared, “is silence.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/books/review/natalie-dykstras-biography-of-clover-adams.html

Today we’re faced with the sorry spectacle of so-called leaders in business and politics seemingly always advancing their own interests, or those of their narrowly defined group, while disingenuously claiming allegiance to the greater good.

Decades of public profligacy, societal indolence and fiscal duplicity have made Athens the moribund man of Europe.

2012-03-02,Inside the List,"HOWL: “The Wolf Gift,” Anne Rice’s first non-Christian novel since she publicly left the faith in 2010 (after a 12-year return to the Catholic Church of her youth), is at No. 5 on the hardcover fiction list this week. Rice is as responsible as anyone for pop culture’s current fascination with vampires — her 1976 novel “Interview With the Vampire” represented a “tectonic shift” and a “radical innovation,” as the essayist Victoria Nelson puts it in her forthcoming book “Gothicka,” “because it was the first to tell the story from the vampire’s point of view.” Now Rice has turned her attention to that other pop-Gothic standby, the werewolf. Her new novel once again mixes vaguely philosophical inquiries about good and evil with standard horror trappings: “His fingers, or were they claws, touched his teeth and they were fangs! He could feel them descending, feel his mouth lengthening! . . . His voice was guttural, roughened. . . . His hands were thickly covered with hair!” Hmmm. A growth spurt, a deeper voice, hair in new places — if you’re smirking here, well, Rice knows that werewolf stories have always echoed the truly scary specter of puberty. On Amazon, where she’s a prolific reviewer of other people’s work, she weighed in last June on “The Company of Wolves,” a 1984 movie by Neil Jordan (who also directed the big-screen version of “Interview”). She called it a masterpiece. “Werewolf films have for decades dealt with the emerging sexuality of adolescents,” she wrote. “But this film outdoes them all. . . . It’s in a class with films like Cocteau’s ‘Beauty and the Beast.’ It goes deep to the very core of what the werewolf myth has always been about.” Disappointingly, Rice hasn’t written an Amazon review of Glen Duncan’s elegant, feral novel “The Last Werewolf,” which spent three weeks on the extended list last summer.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Mann, and related e-mails, saying he suspected that Dr. Mann used fraudulent climate data to secure grants. A lower court also denied the request, saying Mr. Cuccinelli presented nothing to back up his accusation.

The shift by the federation applies to its top boys teams around the country, requiring players on those teams — known as Development Academy teams — to participate in a nearly year-round season and, by extension, forcing them and their soccer moms and dads to decide whether they should play for their club or play for their school.

Violeta Urmana, scheduled to sing, was ill. (Sondra Radvanovsky had filled in for her on Tuesday.) So with just some studio coaching sessions and no rehearsal onstage, Ms. Moore, a 33-year-old Houston native, made her Met debut in the last performance of the revival of the company’s 1988 production this season, with Marco Armiliato conducting. The audience loved her. When Ms. Moore took her solo curtain call at the end, she received an ecstatic ovation.

2012-03-05,Heroine Is Chosen for Last Williams Play,"The coming production of “In Masks Outrageous and Austere” — the final full-length play written by Tennessee Williams and a work that has never been produced for the stage — has found its heroine, the producers are to announce on Monday. Shirley Knight, left, a Tony, Emmy and Golden Globe award winner, will play Babe Foxworth, a wealthy Southern belle who is kidnapped. Ms. Knight has brought many of Williams’s characters to life in the past, most notably Heavenly Finley, in the film version of “Sweet Bird of Youth” (1962), for which she received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. In a telephone interview Ms. Knight described this character as “fierce and wonderful” and compared her with other strong women from Williams’s plays like “The Glass Menagerie” and “Sweet Bird of Youth.” She added: “There is a whole other dark comedy quality to it. It’s very funny. It is unique, but you know it is his voice. It’s Tennessee. It couldn’t be anybody else.” The play is scheduled to run from April 5 to May 26 at Culture Project and is to be directed by David Schweizer. Williams wrote the manuscript over a span of four years until his death, in 1983, and it was kept out of the public eye for years by Gavin Lambert, who worked with Williams on it and to whom he entrusted the manuscript. Mr. Lambert released the play shortly before he died, in 2005, and the work eventually reached Mr. Schweizer. Ms. Knight recalled a missed opportunity in which she was meant to star in Williams’s “Red Devil Battery Sign,” but the production fell apart after his death. She sees this casting as a second chance. “I feel like somehow this came to me for a reason,” she said. “I was meant to do this.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/theater/heroine-is-chosen-for-last-williams-play.html

2012-03-05,Backstage Beauty Report | Kenzo,"“She’s grown up a little bit,” said the hairstylist Anthony Turner backstage of the directive Carol Lim and Humberto Leon gave for this season’s Kenzo girl. “She’s met the man of her dreams — and he’s a rich man.” In contrast to last collection’s loose braids, this girl has hair that’s “the day-after-the-night-before,” meaning a mussed-up version of her date look that led to, well, spending the night. “She had a little romp on the Upper East Side.” To create this effect, Turner used Tigi Catwalk Sessions Series Strong Mousse with a flat brush to blow-dry hair and then pull it into a tight, low ponytail, pinning the folded-over ends up and then destroying the look a little with his fingertips. Wet Look Gel was dabbed on messy ends and the hairline at the face so that when light hit it would look as though the girl had gotten caught in the rain on her way back downtown. For more grown-up makeup, Yadim used M.A.C. Black Track Fluid liner to draw a thick contour with a bit missing; he erased part of the end with the swipe of a wet Q-tip. On cheeks was Taupe creme blush and highlighter on all the planes of the face. Then there was what Yadim called “the surprise of the show” — a changing gradient of lipstick meant to match the clothes that show the girl within the different rooms of her new man’s pad. There was, appropriately, Sin, Dare You, Ruby Woo, Russian Red, So Chaud and Girl About Town mixed with Dare You.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/backstage-beauty-report-kenzo/

Last April a Sony online network for its PlayStation game consoles was hacked, compromising the personal data of some 77 million users; the Sony Music Japan site and Sony Ericsson online store were also hacked in the following weeks.

The treadmill is designed to support speeds up to 50 m.p.h., but the company said it planned to test the Cheetah outside the lab as soon as possible. The previous record was 13.1 m.p.h., set at M.I.T. in 1989. Boston Dynamics, based in Waltham, Mass., has designed a range of mobile robots with financing from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Previous designs, like BigDog, have been machines intended to follow walking soldiers in the field with loads of up to 1,000 pounds. The company said that while Cheetah was a research project, both military and civilian applications were possible, including emergency rescue and the navigation of rugged terrain.

Tonight, at Salle Wagram, the same place where Alexander McQueen staged his dance-marathon collection, his successor, Sarah Burton, gave a magical rendering of both. The show started calmly with snowy white bell-shape coatdresses and laser-cut calf skin, resembling lace. All the models wore helmetlike white-blond wigs, their eyes shielded by visors. Then Ms. Burton turned up the volume, first with feathery and fur coats (like dandelion heads before the wind catches them), and gradually the shapes became monumental in scale.

2012-03-07,Asked & Answered | Paul Dano,"On the afternoon before his New York City premiere of “Being Flynn,” directed by Paul Weitz and based on a profanely titled book by Nick Flynn, the actor Paul Dano waits at the window of an unassuming West Village luncheonette. In a black beanie, thin-rimmed spectacles and gray A.P.C. button-down shirt, which he purchased at half-off, Dano orders a green tea and chicken ratatouille sandwich. Fuel for a day of hustling ahead, he says. (Hustling, for Dano, is having to dine like this with reporters like me.) “It’s not really why I signed up to be an actor,” says the 27-year-old in a thoughtful but unapologetic manner. Dano is a smart guy with an interesting face. He’s not too cocky and he still blushes from time to time, but it’s clear he can hold his own against even the most intimidating actors (his former co-star Daniel Day Lewis, in their Oscar-winning, nightmare-inducing film, “There Will Be Blood,” comes to mind). It’s part of why Paul Weitz cast him opposite Robert De Niro in “Being Flynn,” in which Dano plays the troubled, 20-something Nick Flynn trying to cope with the reemergence of his narcissistic alcoholic father, Jonathan Flynn (De Niro). “At first, I immediately got over the fact that he’s Robert De Niro,” says the actor of his established co-star. “But there was this one day. …”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/asked-answered-paul-dano/

They include tart, slightly bitter collards, called gomen, with some jalapeño heat; a golden turmeric-infused salad of cabbage and carrots, tekele gomen (shown above at right); split yellow peas, or kik (at center), intensified with turmeric and the sweet heat of ginger; and spicy red lentils, or misir (at left), at once mellow and rustic with cumin and berbere, the Ethiopian spice blend.

For men, Pilati made clothes that were dressed up, grown-up, controlled. For women, he had more fun and introduced things like tulip skirts and tunics, leading fashion into silhouettes that shocked and then lasted. (Can one count the number of tulip skirts that were made and worn between 2005 and 2007? Did the tunics that Pilati showed with leggings in his fall 2006 collection not prompt Skinny Jean Mania?). Balancing severity with sexiness, always, Pilati exits YSL with a legacy of looks for the books, from fall ’06’s flower-pouf capelet to fall ’07’s A-line tuxedo mini and the most recent chain-mail racer dress.

2012-03-07,Backstage Beauty Report | Alexander McQueen,"“I’ve always done something outrageous,” explained the manicurist extraordinaire Marian Newman backstage at Alexander McQueen. For at least the past five collections, she said she’d veered away from a natural nail. This season called for something different. “A beautiful, ethereal woman” is how she described the girls with fingernails painted soft white, toenails sheer pink or beige. “A pure girl, almost like a statue,” was how Peter Philips imagined the models at McQueen. He used Chanel’s Mat Lumiere foundation on most of the girls as the primary makeup with a little brow pencil and Rouge Coco Shine lip balm. Eyelashes were curled, but only, Philips admitted, for the purpose of backstage photography, as everyone was to wear futuristic, mirrored glasses/visors, which clipped around the sides of the head. Guido Palau had the difficult task of sourcing 36 wigs in a platinum, almost yellow blond, with four in gray to go with the pink looks in particular. The wigs were fitted with identical hairlines and cuts to “take the personality away,” according to Palau. He was channeling manga racer characters with the slicked-back androgynous look he created with a heavy dose of Redken Forceful 23 Hair Spray. The idea was to contrast the beautiful  super-romantic clothes with a futuristic hairstyle.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/backstage-beauty-report-alexander-mcqueen/

2012-03-07,What Happened to the Girls in Le Roy,"Before the media vans took over Main Street, before the environmental testers came to dig at the soil, before the doctor came to take blood, before strangers started knocking on doors and asking question after question, Katie Krautwurst, a high-school cheerleader from Le Roy, N.Y., woke up from a nap. Instantly, she knew something was wrong. Her chin was jutting forward uncontrollably and her face was contracting into spasms. She was still twitching a few weeks later when her best friend, Thera Sanchez, captain of one of the school’s cheerleading squads, awoke from a nap stuttering and then later started twitching, her arms flailing and head jerking. Two weeks after that, Lydia Parker, also a senior, erupted in tics and arm swings and hums. Then word got around that Chelsey Dumars, another cheerleader, who recently moved to town, was making the same strange noises, the same strange movements, leaving school early on the days she could make it to class at all. The numbers grew — 12, then 16, then 18, in a school of 600 — and as they swelled, the ranks of the sufferers came to include a wider swath of the Le Roy high-school hierarchy: girls who weren’t cheerleaders, girls who kept to themselves and had studs in their lips. There was even one boy and an older woman, age 36. Parents wept as their daughters stuttered at the dinner table. Teachers shut their classroom doors when they heard a din of outbursts, one cry triggering another, sending the increasingly familiar sounds ricocheting through the halls. Within a few months, as the camera crews continued to descend, the community barely seemed to recognize itself. One expert after another arrived to pontificate about what was wrong in Le Roy, a town of 7,500 in Western New York that had long prided itself on the things it got right. The kids here were wholesome and happy, their parents insisted — “cheerleaders and honor students,” as one father said — products of a place that, while not perfect, was made up more of what was good about small-town America than what was bad. Now, though, the girls’ writhing and stuttering suggested something troubling, either arising from within the community or being perpetrated on it, a mystery that proved irresistible for onlookers, whose attention would soon become part of the story itself.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html
2012-03-07,Austerity Chic,"If the British economy is flagging, it’s no worse than it was in 1948, when London’s last Summer Olympics earned the nickname the “Austerity Games” — an irony that hasn’t gone unnoticed. Luckily the city’s museums are stepping in to burnish its brand: two exhibitions focused on postwar British design are making the case that the country’s economic tribulations have always coincided with periods of creative ascendancy. “British Design 1948 to 2012,” opening March 31 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, charts artistic upticks after the war, during the oil crisis in the ’70s and after the recession in the ’80s, when the “creative salvage” movement spurred the careers of designers like Tom Dixon. “Designing Women,” at the Fashion and Textile Museum, which opened March 16, focuses on the midcentury modern textile designs of Lucienne Day, Jacqueline Groag and Marian Mahler, and plays up a heroic moment of British ingenuity: three women inspired by the Bauhaus and the Secessionists rejected the chintzes and florals of the ’30s and ’40s and helped democratize modernism.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/austerity-chic/

McIlroy, 22, was in the audience to watch the exhibition between Sharapova, the former No. 1 player, and his girlfriend, Caroline Wozniacki, who began the year ranked No. 1 and is now No. 4. Toward the end of the match, which Sharapova won, 6-3, 6-4, Wozniacki summoned McIlroy from the stands and handed him her racket. More details can be found at the On Par blog.

You can imagine what Rush Limbaugh, who came up with some choice words for a Georgetown Law School birth-control advocate, might have called Sanger, who, though technically married and the mother of three, had a number of ardent lovers, including a Spanish militant with whom she traipsed around Europe during months of self-imposed exile. Actually, she was on the lam. She had been charged in the United States with distribution of a pamphlet called “Family Limitation,” which discussed birth control methods and pleaded for women to “know their own bodies.” Under the Comstock Act, passed in 1873 and still in force in 1914, this amounted to obscenity.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/what-would-rush-limbaugh-have-said-to-margaret-sanger/

And there’s a full schedule of cultural highlights for 2012. The list includes many music festivals — this is, after all, the country that paved the way to independence with a Singing Revolution — and the premiere in May of a ballet at the Estonian National Opera, “Modigliani, the Cursed Artist.” Throughout Tallinn, remnants of the Soviet era are being repackaged as tourist attractions, while many of the city’s chefs, inspired by the “new Nordic” movement, are busily creating a Baltic cuisine that takes traditional ingredients — from beet root to wild boar — and uses them in inventive ways.

History may well look back on 9/11 as the world’s last underdocumented mega-event. But aside from the absence of phone cameras, the people and streets of September 2001 looked pretty much identical to those of September 2011: the clothes, the hair, the cars. I mention this because it has been only in the past decade that we appear to have entered an aura-free universe in which all eras coexist at once — a state of possibly permanent atemporality given to us courtesy of the Internet. No particular era now dominates. We live in a post-era era without forms of its own powerful enough to brand the times. The zeitgeist of 2012 is that we have a lot of zeit but not much geist.

Though we do solicit professional writers, it is open to anyone with a good tale to tell, and we try as best we can to keep up with the steady torrent of submissions. At the risk of making our jobs utterly impossible, I want to encourage even more writers to take the plunge — because the more stories we get, the higher the quality of what ends up on the page. In doing this, it is not our intention to set people up for failure. The truth is, while getting published is a wonderful achievement, the process of writing a story is itself a rewarding experience.

This display at the Grolier Club, organized by the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library, includes period maps, newspapers and other items related to the Civil War that tell the stories behind the conflict, from the tensions that led to it to the battles that defined it. (Included, above, is an 1864 Currier & Ives lithograph with Lincoln and the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis tugging on a map of the United States held by Gen. George B. McClellan, a Union Army general who unsuccessfully ran for president against Lincoln.) Other pieces include a map used by Lincoln to plot troop movements; the war itself led to a remapping of major battle areas. On Tuesday at 6 p.m. Ronald Grim, curator of the Leventhal Map Center, will talk about the significance of the maps; the talk, like the show, is free, but reservations are requested by e-mailing mbrennan@grolierclub.org, or calling (212) 838-6690.

McClellan, a Union Army general who unsuccessfully ran for president against Lincoln.) Other pieces include a map used by Lincoln to plot troop movements; the war itself led to a remapping of major battle areas. On Tuesday at 6 p.m. Ronald Grim, curator of the Leventhal Map Center, will talk about the significance of the maps; the talk, like the show, is free, but reservations are requested by e-mailing mbrennan@grolierclub.org, or calling (212) 838-6690. The exhibition can be seen Mondays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, grolierclub.org.; it will be on view at Ford’s Theater in Washington, beginning in December. Map-folding skills will not be tested. (Anne Mancuso)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/arts/events-the-150th-anniversary-of-the-civil-war.html

2012-03-09,Up Front,"Douglas Coupland has a knack for making terms stick. He popularized “Generation X.” Ditto “McJob.” And in his review of Hari Kunzru’s new novel, “Gods Without Men,” he may have done it again, by delineating an entire literary genre: “Trans­lit.” (See his review for the definition.) Coupland’s innovations aren’t restricted to the written word, however. The author of 13 novels, a story collection and seven books of nonfiction, he is also a visual artist who has exhibited in North America, Europe and Asia. (His art is on display through March 11 at the Armory Show in New York.) Much of his work has examined the collision of technology with culture, body and spirit. “Aliens didn’t come down to Earth and give us technology,” he said via e-mail. “We invented it ourselves. Therefore it can never be alienating; it can only be an expression of our humanity.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/up-front.html

There for the taking are fresh bread, cheese, artisanal salami, chestnuts, cookies and many varieties of sparkling wine, all on the honor system — or, as the proprietor, Cesare De Stefani, phrases it, “trust in the people.” De Stefani, who produces the salami and prosecco nearby, asks that visitors simply leave money for what they eat and drink in a locked box on site. “I thought how nice it could be for a tourist or friend to arrive here and discover my vineyard and the old house,” he says, “finding fresh prosecco wine to be tasted in the absence of the landlord.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/edible-selby-inn-absentia/

In “The Escape Artists,” Noam Scheiber, a senior editor at The New Republic, covers many of the same meetings, egos and behind-the-scenes debates. In both books, the president comes across as cerebral, well intentioned and initially naïve — no match for obstructionist Republicans in Congress. Both authors portray Obama’s former chief economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, as the quintessential turf-obsessed senior White House aide. Scheiber also shares Suskind’s disappointment that the Obama administration did not act more aggressively to combat the economic crisis it inherited from George W. Bush.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/the-escape-artists-by-noam-scheiber.html

2012-03-09,Marrying Up,"Seventy-five years ago, Edward VIII swapped his kingdom for a divorcée, the American-born Wallis Warfield Simpson. At this advanced date, could there possibly be anything new to add to the mountain of autobiographies, biographies, memoirs, novels and films that have accreted on this subject? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. In “That Woman,” Anne Sebba boldly recasts the relationship that was once considered the “most romantic love story of the last century” as “a tale of gothic darkness with a Faustian pact at its core.” The king, in Sebba’s telling, emerges as a man who today might be looked on as something of a stalker.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/that-woman-by-anne-sebba.html

But it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and fortunately we also have the ability to operate on automatic pilot, performing complex behaviors without any conscious thought at all. One way this happens is with lots of practice. Tasks that seem impossibly complex at first, like learning how to play the guitar, speak a foreign language or operate a new DVD player, become second nature after we perform those actions many times (well, maybe not the DVD player). “If practice did not make perfect,” William James said, “nor habit economize the expense of nervous and muscular energy, he” (we, that is) “would therefore be in a sorry plight.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/the-power-of-habit-by-charles-duhigg.html

2012-03-09,Inside the List,"OFF AND RUNNING: One recurring knock against Ernest Hemingway is that late in his career, he fell back on lazy imitations of the terse machismo that had made him famous. But any writer with a distinctive style runs the risk of self-parody. Consider Tom Wolfe, who used exclamation points and electric Kool-Aid prose to help reinvent journalism before moving on to Technicolor zeitgeisty novels like “The Bonfire of the Vanities” and “A Man in Full.” Wolfe’s new novel, “Back to Blood,” won’t be released until this fall. But the book’s description on Amazon makes it sound like the sort of sprawling social novel that might have been churned out by a white-suited Tom Wolfe cyborg. Here it is: “As a police launch speeds across Miami’s Biscayne Bay — with officer Nestor Camacho on board — Tom Wolfe is off and running. Into the feverous landscape of the city, he introduces the Cuban mayor, the black police chief, a wanna-go-muckraking young journalist and his Yale-marinated editor; an Anglo sex-addiction psychiatrist and his Latina nurse by day, loin lock by night — until lately, the love of Nestor’s life; a refined and oh-so-light-skinned young woman from Haiti and her Creole-spouting, black-gang-banger-stylin’ little brother; a billionaire porn addict, crack dealers in the ’hoods, ‘de-skilled’ conceptual artists at the Miami Art Basel Fair, ‘spectators’ at the annual Biscayne Bay regatta looking only for that night’s orgy, yenta-heavy ex-New Yorkers at an ‘Active Adult’ condo and a nest of shady Russians.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html

These additions to Pom Pom — which was introduced in 2007 — include 12 rings, 11 bracelets and 3 earrings set “in a more daring way, one that breaks the rules of traditional fine jewelry,” Morante says. Take, for example, the chandelier earrings, whose asymmetrical aquamarines are suspended almost haphazardly between pink sapphires and white diamonds, or the cocktail ring made of a cushion-cut red tourmaline bursting from a bed of flat, rose-cut diamonds.

2012-03-09,The Week Ahead,"IF you like your entertainment blood chilling instead of heartwarming — and failed to succumb to the magnolia-scented charms of “The Help” — you might consider spending time with “THE MAIDS,” which opens on Thursday in a Red Bull Theater production. Like “The Help,” an Oscar nominee for best picture this year, “The Maids” considers the problems of sorely put-upon domestics, who are routinely humiliated by their affluent, self-centered employer. But because “The Maids” was written by Jean Genet, one of the most subversive dramatists ever, sentimentality doesn’t figure in this coruscating one-act drama from 1947. The fire of homicidal rebellion glows in the hearts of the play’s title characters (who were inspired by an infamous French murder case of 1933). And they do their darnedest to fan that spark into flame by acting out fantasies of their much-loathed mistress’s destruction. Jesse Berger directs this in-the-round presentation of Genet’s identity-bending chef-d’oeuvre. Ana Reeder and Jeanine Seralles portray the sisters in servitude, while the wonderful J. Smith-Cameron (of television’s “True Blood” and the movie “Margaret”) is the eminently killable lady of the house.

Jaczko, said that despite the disaster the plant probably met the agency’s safety goals because it did not result in big radiation doses to the general population. The accident’s immediate health consequences were “very close to nothing,” with “little to no” long-term health effects, he said. But the destruction of reactors, the mass evacuations and the destruction of property were “clearly unacceptable,” Mr. Jaczko said. The commission’s great challenge is to be “proactive” in identifying previously unforeseen risks, primarily natural disasters.

Hope you enjoyed the spoils, money and adulation of your peers. But now that your keeper deadline is approaching, there may be one other residual from your victory. In many leagues, especially keeper leagues, draft picks are tradable. In fact, chances are you may have parted with some picks last season to ascend that peak. But now you have a surplus of players to keep, and it’s incumbent on you to maximize your value in trading them off. But it’s easier said than done – the other owners know that you have a surplus, and naturally value their picks, especially if they traded off some of their talent last season to compete better in the future. One method that worked well for me this year is the Silent Auction.",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/fantasy-focus-the-silent-auction/

But for both photographers, there is an element of blind faith at work here. For the past six years, Ducklo has documented visually impaired visitors interacting with sculptures on touch tours of museums like MoMA and the Met. Monteith spent the better part of a year at the American Academy in Rome where he captured tourists looking at the city’s many monumental attractions, seeking the precise moment when the artwork infiltrates the viewers’ imagination and the act of looking becomes an act of seeing. “You don’t know how they are experiencing the work, but you know how it looks like they are experiencing it,” says Ducklo regarding the slippery nature of perception. At the very least, says Cory Jacobs, who curated the show, “the photos make you slow down and take notice of how quickly we tend to pass things by.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/points-of-view-matt-ducklo-and-matthew-monteith-at-hermes/

Putin by a rock band made up of masked feminist activists in front of the altar of Christ the Savior Cathedral last month must remain in pretrial detention until April 24. The women, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were arrested on March 3, on the eve of Russia’s presidential elections, which Mr. Putin won after a wave of protests appeared to threaten his rule. They face up to seven years in prison. A video of the performance circulated on YouTube. Mr. Putin’s spokesman has said that he found the performance offensive. Russian Orthodox Church leaders have said that the band’s actions were blasphemous and that the women should be prosecuted, although not necessarily imprisoned. Yet some church activists have said that the case is politically motivated and have called for their immediate release. The women’s lawyers said there was no proof that they participated in the performance.

Indeed, there was much to celebrate. The Flatiron location, once a wild frontier for retail, has been a neighborhood hub — a hot spot for expat Englishmen and local actors and musicians who’d hang out in the store’s suit room — since it opened in 1987. I worked there around that time (as an esteemed stock boy); the stacks of printed corduroy shirts, oversize paisleys and natty Prince of Wales suits were a far cry from the collegiate-preppy of my past, and I became hooked. Paul, as he was called pre-knighthood, visited the store often and was known for his pranks and silly sense of humor. True, his eccentric Englishness showed in the clothes via colored linings and purple pinstripes, brightly embroidered button holes and all kinds of prints: floral, animal, fruit and vegetables.

Rick Owens created an homage to his wife, partner and muse, Michelle Lamy, with the director Ruth Hogben. The Japanese brand Comme des Garçons’ contribution, “Silence, Genius at Work” (shown here), is an intimate encounter with the pianist Madeleine Malraux by Katerina Jebb, who has worked with the brand in the past on fragrance projects. “These things just propose themselves,” says Jebb of her current subject. Jebb’s aim was to make an abstract study of Malraux that did not follow any particular narrative path, or as she puts it, “an observation of nonspecific ambition,” who might as well be speaking about the designer Rei Kawakubo, who shows her nonspecific ambition on her sleeve every season.

2012-03-16,Strange Justice,"Texas justice has rarely been kind to homosexuals. Take, for example, the case of Calvin Burdine, who was sentenced to death in 1984 for the murder of his male companion. Burdine’s court-­appointed lawyer, when not dozing, referred to his client as a “fairy.” The prosecutor, meanwhile, demanded the death penalty by arguing that gays actually look forward to the rewards of prison life. “Sending a homosexual to the penitentiary,” he claimed, “certainly isn’t a very bad punishment for a homosexual.” Astonishingly, a federal appeals panel first upheld the verdict on the grounds that nothing in the law guarantees a defendant the right to a fully conscious attorney. Burdine eventually won a new trial, at which he was again convicted, but this time sentenced to life in prison — a veritable candy store, it was said, for a “pervert” like him.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/the-story-of-lawrence-v-texas-by-dale-carpenter.html

Apparently she knew the perpetrator, since she let him into her handsome home on a quiet side street in Greenwood, S.C. The crime itself was horrific. She was beaten with a blunt object, stabbed repeatedly — one ear was almost severed — probably sexually assaulted; her body was stuffed into a bedroom closet, where it was discovered on Monday afternoon, Jan. 18. The next day the police arrested Edward Lee Elmore, a 23-year-old handyman whom Edwards had recently hired to do a few odd jobs around the house. He was formally charged with first-degree murder on Jan. 21, tried in the second week of April, found guilty by a jury that deliberated for two and a half hours, and sentenced to death.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/anatomy-of-injustice-by-raymond-bonner.html

Before he escaped, he wrote a letter explaining his actions and vowed that once he had earned enough money he would reimburse his owner, Susan Williams, to prove “that I dont mean to be dishonest but wish to pay her every cent that I think my Servaces is worth.” Brown’s letter reveals much about his character. He was orderly and moderate. He hated to do something that was “criminal” but felt he had no choice. His had not been a hasty or unreasonable decision.

His roots and manner were journalistic — he fit into the world of newspapers (including The New York Times Book Review, which he edited in the 1970s), magazines (Harper’s, The Nation, New York), radio (“Fresh Air”) and television (“CBS Sunday Morning”) — and that casual, accessible tone may be why, for all his erudition, he is usually not discussed in the same breath with other literary arbiters who radiated more gravitas.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/john-leonards-reading-for-my-life.html

Now comes Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III with a bracingly clear and bipartisan message: All the theories are bunk! According to Wilkinson’s “Cosmic Constitutional Theory,” “the theories have given rise to nothing less than competing schools of liberal and conservative judicial activism, schools that have little in common other than a desire to seek theoretical cover for prescribed and often partisan results.” As a result of their cosmic theorizing, Wilkinson concludes, liberal and conservative judges and justices are too quick to second-guess the choices of legislatures, and the casualty is “our inalienable right of self-governance.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/cosmic-constitutional-theory-by-j-harvie-wilkinson-iii.html

But during this year’s presidential campaign season, another candidate evidently thought it was. In January, during the run-up to Russia’s March 4 election, the front-runner, Vladimir Putin, proposed “a canon of 100 Russian books that every school leaver will be required to read at home . . . and then write an essay about one of them.” Reading, according to Putin, is not just an elective individual activity, but one that has decisive implications for the nation. “State policy with regard to culture must provide appropriate guidelines,” he wrote in an essay in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, and culture shapes “public consciousness and . . . patterns of behavior.” The Kremlin’s duty, Putin explained, is to counter the decline in literacy and restore Russia as “a reading nation.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/books/review/russias-leader-proposes-a-new-canon.html

Writing in 2008, soon after Wallace hanged himself at 46, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of Wallace’s astounding voice: “Hyperarticulate, plaintive, self-mocking, diffident, overbearing, needy, ironical, almost pathologically self-aware (and nearly impossible to quote in increments smaller than a thousand words) — it was something you instantly recognized even hearing it for the first time.

It’s a place so singular and remote that it has its own peculiar time zone, 1.5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time — though in truth it feels like it’s hundreds of years behind: when it’s 10 p.m. in New York, it’s 1825 on Fogo Island.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/t-magazine/the-possibility-of-an-island-in-canada.html

2012-03-16,Inside the List,"APOCALYPSE THEN: The historian Elaine Pagels has been a popular, though polarizing, figure ever since she introduced readers to early competing views of Christianity in her 1979 book “The Gnostic Gospels,” which won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. That book, her first for a mainstream audience, received a mostly dismissive review in our pages from the Rev. Raymond E. Brown, a biblical scholar and Catholic priest who concluded, in his last sentence, that the gnostics’ chief adversary, “crusty old Irenaeus,” had been “right, after all, to regard the gnostics as the crazies of the second century.” But Pagels’s analysis of the early church struck a nerve, and not just at the time. As Laura Miller noted recently in Salon, a “badly garbled version” turned up in “The Da Vinci Code” in 2003 and “proceeded to blow the minds of many readers.” Coincidentally (or not), 2003 is also the year Pagels scored her first New York Times best seller, “Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas.” Her next book, a study of Judas written with the Harvard professor Karen King, also landed here, in 2007, and now Pagels is back. Her latest effort, “Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Reviewing the book in The New Yorker this month, Adam Gopnik highlighted Pagels’s argument that Revelation is “essentially an anti-Christian polemic . . . written by an expatriate follower of Jesus who wanted the movement to remain within an entirely Jewish context, as opposed to the ‘Christianity’ just then being invented.” Gopnik continued: “The scarlet whores and mad beasts in Revelation are the Gentile followers of Paul — and so, in a neat irony, the spiritual ancestors of today’s Protestant evangelicals.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But lawn care was far from Budding’s mind when he invented the push mower. His original brief was to solve a mechanical problem for a clothing mill regarding the production of guardsmen’s uniforms. Budding was asked to come up with a way to “cut all the tufts and bobbly bits off the nap of the cloth,” writes Brian Radam in “Lawn Mowers and Grasscutters: A Complete Guide.” Budding soon realized the device had other applications. In 1830, he filed a patent for a machine that, when pushed and pulled, would cause a cylindrical blade to rotate over a stationary shear, cutting grass and collecting the clippings. The mower may have put the scythe men out of work, but it enabled the English fashion for grass carpets.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/magazine/who-made-that-lawn-mower.html

His audacity had merit. The origins of the widescreen image can be traced to “Napoleon,” which also featured hand-held camerawork, eye-blink-fast editing, gorgeous tints, densely layered superimpositions and images shot from a pendulum, a sled, a bicycle and a galloping horse.

A small excerpt of that story appears in the pages that follow, and I hope you will find it as charming and disarming as we do. On the one hand, it’s like a literary version of Mike Mills’s “Beginners,” almost entirely populated by Hasids; on the other, it’s a wonderful exploration of the stories we tell ourselves to justify and impart narrative weight to our curiosities and compulsions.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/t-magazine/editors-letter.html

Nowadays the theory is well-established, and straightforward techniques for determining probabilities are available. But even in modern times, experts can often get egg on their faces in simple probability problems, as was seen in the famous brouhaha caused by the Monty Hall problem.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/numberplay-picking-items-from-a-bag/

2012-03-20,The Right Angle,"Ward Bennett (1917-2003) was one of design’s great American success stories. He left home at 13, created dresses and window displays, met Brancusi and studied painting with Hans Hofmann — before he was 30. When he turned to design, his clients included David Rockefeller, Gianni Agnelli and Jann and Jane Wenner. Bennett used industrial materials before they were chic and insisted that his furniture be comfortable. Many of his designs went out of production, leaving aficionados to hunt the secondhand market. But now Herman Miller is adding several Bennett pieces (including the Scissor chair and I-Beam table shown here) to its Herman Miller Collection, a portfolio of products for home and office that also includes classics by the Eameses, Nelson and Noguchi; contemporary designers like Sam Hecht, Leon Ransmeier and Ayse Birsel; and the Italian brands Magis and Mattiazzi. (The collection will make its debut this month; go to hermanmiller.com) As Ben Watson, the company’s executive creative director, says, “We are celebrating our design heritage, but we’re not just looking backward.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/the-right-angle/

2012-03-20,The Ryan Budget 2.0,"The new House Republican budget looks a lot like last year’s House Republican budget, and is likely to earn the same sort of reactions: If you loved Paul Ryan 1.0 you’ll love 2.0 as well; if you considered the first iteration a nightmare of social Darwinist cruelty then the second iteration probably won’t change your mind. But for those of us who considered last year’s document a brave rough draft in need of substantial improvement, the good news is that it has been significantly improved: The proposed Medicare reform, which is the centerpiece of the budget and far and away its most important and courageous component, has been revised in the direction of the proposal that Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden and Ryan co-sponsored earlier this year, which means that it includes (among other things) a more realistic vision of how fast the proposed “premium support” for Medicare recipients would grow and a traditional fee-for-service Medicare as one of the options competing for those premium-support dollars. For a longer version of why this shift makes sense, I recommend reading Yuval Levin’s Weekly Standard piece on Medicare reform; for the shorter version, suffice to say that Ryan 2.0 addresses the fairest liberal attack on the original budget’s Medicare proposal, making its vision for entitlement reform more plausible as policy and politics alike.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/the-ryan-budget-2-0/

This commenter from Seattle only tells us that the experience can be attended by the fear that an investment banker will inevitably arrive, buy the land and start “herding cattle with a helicopter.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/experiences-in-nature-from-our-readers-and-an-18th-century-philosopher/

Among the most frequently used were the Converse sneakers and the structured handlebar Prada bag (although no one recommended wearing these things together). One user created two pants-driven layouts that made our list (tinker23, from Turkey, apparently loves pointy-toed pumps and hoop earrings — so easy to get behind this spring). Another user, catv41, proposed a mustard/navy color combination anchored by black accessories that I would wear tomorrow if I could.

2012-03-22,Chile: Landmark Gay Rights Ruling," The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that Chile must pay damages to a judge who was denied custody of her three daughters by the Supreme Court in 2004 because of her sexual orientation. The ruling by the human rights court, a judicial entity of the Organization of American States, requires Chile’s government to pay the judge, Karen Atala, left, $50,000, in addition to $12,000 in court costs. The February ruling, which was made public on Wednesday in Chile, is the latest development in a multiyear legal battle waged by Judge Atala, a lesbian who had lost custody of her daughters to her ex-husband, also a judge. Judge Atala’s lawyer called the decision “historic” for Chile’s legal system. Justice Minister Teodoro Ribera said Wednesday that Chilean authorities had acted to protect the “superior interests of the children involved,” but he also said Chile would respect the ruling.

The vocabulary, however, is not especially sophisticated. The jumps and turns, though often breathtakingly fast, don’t extend the lexicon.

2012-03-23,Who Made That Granola?,"You can trace breakfast cereal back to gruel-eating ancient Greeks, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that the idea of eating cold cereal was embraced. In 1863, Dr. James Caleb Jackson, a health reformer who believed illness was rooted in the stomach, began experimenting with cold cereal to augment the mineral-spring treatments at his sanitarium in upstate New York. He baked graham flour into brittle cakes, which he then crumbled and baked again. It was not an immediate success; in fact, it was edible only when soaked in milk overnight. Even so, Jackson’s granula, as he called it, would soon have competition. It was not long before Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a Michigan man with a sanitarium of his own, was also promoting a healthful cold cereal. Kellogg ran the Battle Creek Sanitarium, popular with luminaries like Amelia Earhart. He, too, was a digestive evangelist, and in the late 1870s or early ’80s, Kellogg combined wheat flour, oatmeal and cornmeal into a mixture that he also called granula. Jackson sued. Kellogg duly switched the “u” to an “o,” and by 1889, he was selling two tons of granola a week. Kellogg went on to invent the cereal flake, which led to the Kellogg’s cereal empire, which led to Froot Loops and Cocoa Krispies.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/magazine/who-made-that-granola.html

2012-03-23,Mall Rats,"Nobody ever hated the contemporary world with as much intensity and conviction as J. G. Ballard. In five decades of unforgiving literary production, he drowned it, scorched it, flayed it with whirlwinds, deluged it with Martian sand, even transformed it into a crystalline jungle populated by jewel-skinned crocodiles, people and parrots. His characters have been sodomized in car crashes, driven crazy by scientific researchers, hounded by billboards and forced to observe atrocities looping endlessly on movie screens until even Zapruder’s exploding bullets seemed as mundane and predictable as elevator music. For Ballard, who died in 2009 at the age of 78, the true horrors of our collective future don’t concern what might happen hundreds of years from now in a spaceship; rather, they reverberate in the very ordinary now-ness of freeway overpasses, sports stadiums, high-rise apartment complexes and gated communities.

2012-03-23,Inside the List,"THE ICK FACTOR: For his academic research into morality, the psychologist Jonathan Haidt — his new book, “The Righteous Mind,” is at No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list — likes to ask the kind of hypothetical questions that are more commonly the province of seventh-grade slumber parties. Would you drink apple juice if you knew a sterilized cockroach had touched it? Would you sign a nonbinding contract to sell your soul? If you find your dog dead on the road, killed by a passing car, is it O.K. to carry it home and cook it up for dinner? Haidt’s book is a serious study of divergent moral viewpoints in politics and religion, but he obviously gets a kick out of confronting his subjects with the ick factor: “If you are not a liberal or libertarian Westerner,” he writes in his first chapter, “you probably think it’s wrong — morally wrong — for someone to have sex with a chicken carcass and then eat it.” Haidt doesn’t say where he comes down on the chicken question, but he did tell The Boston Globe recently that his book initially stemmed from a desire to advance liberal positions. “When I switched over into studying politics in 2004,” he said, “I did it expressly to help the Democrats beat the Republicans. I wanted to use moral psychology to help my team! But in the process of learning about all sides, and delving deeply into political psychology, I sort of lost the partisan fervor, and now I’m fascinated. That’s what I hope moral psychology can do for people — replace demonization with fascination.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that most of those laws were unconstitutional, saying that they endangered prostitutes by forcing them to work on the streets rather than in controlled circumstances indoors and prevented them from taking certain safety precautions, like hiring bodyguards. But the court did uphold laws against soliciting. The federal government is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The hands-on process takes about four hours per rug; devising the patterns can take considerably longer.

2012-03-28,Pairings: Stuffed Trout With Porter Sauce,"Porters are deceiving. They show dark richness in the glass, but on the palate, the beers are refreshingly dry, not heavy, and can harmonize with more foods than a fruit-forward cabernet. Every match is welcome, from a plate of briny oysters to a rack of ribs rimmed with char. If the dish mirrors some of the beer’s subtle notes of chocolate, coffee, spice, toast and smoke, all the better. I roasted a good-size trout seasoned with soy sauce — another flavor that showed up in the beers — and stuffed it with toasted bread crumbs. A healthy splash of porter also went into the pan to make a sauce. The fish can be readied for roasting well in advance. And the recipe can easily be doubled, serving four or more for a dinner party.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/dining/stuffed-trout-with-porter-sauce-recipe.html

States that use sodium thiopental to render prisoners unconscious as part of their execution protocols reached out to foreign suppliers when the sole domestic manufacturer stopped producing the drug, which had not been approved for importation. The F.D.A. said it had no jurisdiction over execution drugs. Judge Leon wrote that the agency “appears to be simply wrapping itself in the flag of law enforcement discretion to justify its authority and masquerade an otherwise seemingly callous indifference to the health consequences of those imminently facing the executioner’s needle.

In the months that followed, some of Washington’s most connected Democrats and Republicans told me in casual conversations that they didn’t know whose story to believe, or even what, exactly, had been on the table during the negotiations. A few mentioned, independently of one another, that the entire affair reminded them of “Rashomon,” the classic Kurosawa film in which four characters filter the same murder plot through their different perspectives. Over time, the whole debacle became the perfect metaphor for a city in which the two parties seem more and more to occupy not just opposing places on the political spectrum, but distinct realities altogether.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html

2012-03-29,Creation and Expression: Reflecting on Text and Context in Art,"Overview | What does art tell us about the time and place of its creation, and what does the context tell us about an artwork? In this lesson, students consider the work of Keith Haring in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which can be used as a framework for studying any artist and era. Students research historically and culturally significant events as a potential means to understand artists and their works.

I always found that nature’s “silence,” that is, what remains when the din of human presence is subtracted, far superior as an affirmation of being. Only there can I really become aware of the effect of my presence. Here in the New York-Boston corridor, noise is everywhere, almost impossible to bear. I can’t separate my presence from the noise.

It was there that JEM, a Toronto rubber company, introduced a contraption known alternatively as the “poo-poo cushion” and the “boop-boop a doop,” until, in 1932, it settled on “whoopee.” A collector named Stan Timm owns an early model: it’s green, with a wooden mouth and a drawing of a gun-toting boy wearing a devious smile and a kilt.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/who-made-that-whoopee-cushion.html

Meanwhile, as the planet warms, ice caps melt, oceans acidify and dry regions desertify. To choose just one metric of doom, about 30 percent of the world’s fish populations have either collapsed or are on their way to collapse; to choose another, global carbon emissions rose by a record 5.9 percent in 2010, a worrisome development considering that the period was characterized by slow economic growth.

M.R. is “renowned in academic circles,” an eminent philosopher, a diplomatic administrator and a selfless hard worker. But a creeping distress threatens to engulf her. Living by herself in the museumlike president’s house has proved lonely and uncomfortable. She has no intimate friends. Her secret, much older lover is not only long married to someone else and ensconced at far-off Harvard, he has begun staying away entirely, seeming less than thrilled by her professional ascent.

Or would this novel (which I loved) have been relegated to “Women’s Fiction,” that close-quartered lower shelf where books emphasizing relationships and the interior lives of women are often relegated? Certainly “The Marriage Plot,” Eugenides’s first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Middlesex,” was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about women’s lives never find a way to escape “Women’s Fiction” and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men (and, yes, some women — more about them later), are prominently displayed and admired.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/on-the-rules-of-literary-fiction-for-men-and-women.html

2012-03-30,Inside the List,"HELP, THANKS, WOW: There was a time, three or four years ago, when it seemed every novelist had a blog, and why not? Blogging gave writers another way to reach readers, to promote their work or air their grievances or test their ideas in mini-essays that played to their strengths. But technology evolves, and despite some notable holdouts (Elif Batuman is one) Twitter has killed the blogging star. Now writers connect with their publics in 140 characters or fewer. The medium especially favors authors with distinct voices, preferably funny ones, who can toss off pithy observations or one-liners — authors like Anne Lamott, say, whose new book, “Some Assembly Required,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 9. Lamott’s best writing has always had the dashed-off immediacy of a good tweet; her excellent 1993 book “Operating Instructions” strung together one punch line after another to capture the joys and anxieties of her son’s first year of life. The new book is a sequel — her son (and co-author), Sam, now has a son of his own — and to promote it, Lamott has been posting her daffy, neurotic, inspirational shtick in the telegraphic shorthand that Twitter followers are used to. From an airplane on the first leg of her recent book tour, she wrote: “New low @ 30,000 feet — checked Amazon sales rank of ‘Some Assembly . . . ’ @­samlamott trying to wrestle iPad out of my hands. I need air marshal.” Later, in Washington, she was more reflective: “D.C.; cherry blossoms in full pink pyrotechnic bloom. Humbling & convincing (but I’m easy). 3rd great prayer, after Help and Thanks, is Wow!” Almost 20 years ago I sat in on Lamott’s writing class in Marin County, Calif., where one of the students turned out to be her former elementary school principal. Even in second grade she’d been a bundle of comic nervous energy, he told me. “We all knew she was going to be a star.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The portrait by Brooke Hodge and Jason Schmidt reveals it as the most wonderful place, crammed with porcelains, photographs, children’s party favors, cactuses and shells. One feels as though one has entered a terrarium, a feeling that lingers as one crosses the garden back to her house and spies, nestled in the plantings, more of Garofalo’s delightful porcelain wonders. It’s marvelous to encounter such a harmonious place where there are no walls between that which is interior (creativity and love, for a start) and that which is exterior.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/t-magazine/editors-letter-t-spring-design-issue.html
