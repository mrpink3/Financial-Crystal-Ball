It’s a scene familiar from countless western films, but in Pedro Almodóvar’s new short, “Strange Way of Life,” in theaters next month, only a few minutes elapse before the two characters end up in bed together. When Silva (Pedro Pascal) visits his former lover Jake (Ethan Hawke), he rekindles their romance before revealing less amorous intentions. Intrigue ensues, and the shock of two gay cowboys gives way to what we might expect from a classic western: shootouts, horseback chases, fugitive justice. Almodóvar’s second film in English forgoes the melodrama for which he is best known, adhering instead to genre traditions, so “the interrupted and then resumed love story between these two men will be taken more seriously,” the 73-year-old Spanish director says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/t-magazine/gay-cowboys-masculinity.html

2023-09-08,A Jewel-Encrusted Ring That Conjures the Spirit of a Black Forest Wedding,"One senses that the establishment of Van Cleef & Arpels was preordained. The husband and wife Alfred Van Cleef and Estelle Arpels — the son of a diamond cutter and the daughter of a gemstone dealer — opened the French maison in 1906 in Paris’s First Arrondissement, where they began making wristwatches and jewelry adorned with wood and gems inspired by good luck charms. During the following decades, the brand continued to innovate — inventing the minaudière and creating necklaces that could be worn as bracelets — and in 1933 it introduced the Mystery Setting, in which stones appeared to be invisibly placed without any of their metal fasteners showing. Whimsical designs, which gained a loyal following from the likes of Princess Grace of Monaco and Elizabeth Taylor, took cues from the cosmos, flora and fauna, mythology, poetry, ballet, fairy tales, architecture and Surrealism. In the 1940s and ’50s, Van Cleef & Arpels introduced a collection of dome-like gold rings covered in kaleidoscopic arrays of multicolored jewels.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/t-magazine/van-cleef-arpels-bridal-crown-ring.html

When he was a fourth grader, his all-Black elementary school in Kentucky was preparing for a visit to a nearby white school to mark what was then known as Negro History Week. “We were supposed to sing this song,” recalls Wolfe, 68. “And our principal told us that when we got to a certain line, we should sing it with full conviction because it would shatter all the racism in the room.” To this day, he can remember standing with his classmates singing, “These truths we are declaring, that all men are the same,” and then suddenly belting out, “that liberty’s a torch burning with a steady flame.” “That’s why I’m a storyteller,” he says. “Because someone told me when I was 10 that if I fully committed with my passion and my intelligence and my heart to a line, I could change people.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/t-magazine/carrie-mae-weems-george-c-wolfe.html

In idiomatic usage, per the dictionary, “vanilla” (or, more damningly, “plain vanilla,” as if that were not redundant) means “having no special or extra features.” So: the bare minimum, the absence of flourish, the annihilation of fun — buttoned-up and bougie, innocuousness incarnate.

When the results came in, however, about 900 straight women who participated were surprised by what the email offered: a friend match instead of a love interest. The survey was a lark, something most Tulane students saw as an icebreaker more than an important service. But the results pointed to a phenomenon at the school — and at many other schools — that has only grown more pronounced since then, one that affects much more than just students’ social lives: Women now outnumber men on campus, by a wide margin.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/magazine/men-college-enrollment.html

Musk talks about having Asperger’s, which makes him “bad at picking up social cues.” As the people closest to him will attest, he lacks empathy — something that Isaacson describes as a “gene” that’s “hard-wired.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/books/review/elon-musk-walter-isaacson.html

2023-09-12,What Ancient Greek Tragedies Can Teach Us About Grief,"Sometimes, art precedes life. The word “landscape,” for instance, originally meant a painting, and only later also the land itself. In a similar way, “tragedy” originated onstage, as a dramatic form, before acquiring the more general meaning of a devastating or unfortunate situation. What we now think of as Greek tragedy is a relatively small corpus from the fifth century B.C., fewer than three dozen plays from the hundreds that were produced over the course of that century. Among the tragedians, there are extant works from only three: Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Their plays premiered at the annual City Dionysia, a festival that was held on the slopes of the Acropolis each spring, drawing large audiences. Some of the features of those premieres might seem strange to us now: Each dramatist presented four plays at a time, in competition; the performances took place outdoors in daylight; the actors wore masks of fixed expression; and, with the exception of the chorus, the roles in any given play were performed by no more than three actors, all male. Theatrical conventions have changed since then. But the plays still reach us with their clarity, nobility and wisdom. When I flew to Athens last summer, it was to fulfill a dream of seeing Greek tragedy performed in Greece. I hoped to come closer to the strange power of these works.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/magazine/greek-tragedy.html

As the submissions rolled in, one trend stood out: “There were so many cigarettes!” So many, in fact, that when their “Secret Show” opened in May, one room was dedicated entirely to cigarette-inspired art: There were nearly three-foot-high versions that resembled shaggy plush toys, made by Thomas Martinez-Pilnik, 29. There were sculptures in a variety of stubbed-out shapes constructed from steel by Mary Gagler, and clay by Emily Marchand. And on a 4-by-5-foot square of AstroTurf, 17 true-to-scale ceramic butts by Taylor Lee Nicholson, 32, were scattered like the contents of an overturned ashtray. “For these artists, cigarettes seem to represent childhood memories of their parents or grandparents smoking, but also a lost human connection,” Gori says. “I think there’s a yearning to return to an analog socialness and a time that cigarettes represent.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/t-magazine/cigarettes-food-art.html

2023-09-14,An Exhibition of U.F.O. Art Lands in Idaho,"Seen from Paris’s Pont de la Tournelle, the eight-story facade of the landmark restaurant La Tour d’Argent looks about the same as it did when its third-generation owner André Terrail grew up there in the 1980s, deploying toy parachutists into quayside traffic. But the interior is no longer indifferent to the 21st century: Late last month, La Tour d’Argent reopened its doors after a yearlong renovation led by the Paris-based architect Franklin Azzi. “It’s my Tour,” says Terrail, who took over following his father’s death in 2006. “The same, but more exacting, more thoughtful.” The new look draws on the outsize history of the classically French fine-dining institution, which has been serving diners since 1582, taking particular inspiration from the streamlined motifs of its Art Deco era. On the seventh floor, the redesigned restaurant — overseen since 2020 by executive chef Yannick Franques — functions more than ever as a theater. The airy dining room, in shades of indigo and silver, looks onto an open-plan kitchen and an elevated platform where the restaurant’s signature pressed-duck dish is prepared nightly. Upstairs and downstairs are new bars suited to less formal occasions: Le Bar des Maillets d’Argent, an all-day lounge with a fireplace, and Le Toit de la Tour, a rooftop terrace. Given that it has the welcoming air of a boutique hotel, it’s no wonder that the building can now host overnight visitors in a private apartment on the fifth floor, complete with a touch of Scandinavian-style minimalism attributable, in part, to Terrail’s Finnish mother. tourdargent.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/t-magazine/ufo-sightings-art-sun-valley-museum-idaho.html

2023-09-15,The Make-Do Joys of Terrazzo,"For the Queens-based duo Raphael Martinez Cohen, 34, and Ryan Bush, 32, terrazzo is a way to repurpose the detritus of daily life. The two artists founded their joint sculptural practice, Ficus Interfaith, nine years ago. Since then, they have added peach stones, oyster shells, the royal blue glass of Saratoga water bottles, petrified wood and deer bones — discovered on Martinez Cohen’s parents’ property in upstate New York — to the mix of marble chips, other stone fragments and cement that is traditionally ground up to make terrazzo, the speckled composite material that has become the pair’s primary medium. Martinez Cohen and Bush combine their unconventional rock substitutes with colored cement or epoxy, forming a slurry that they pour into zinc and brass outlines to create kitschy, expressionistic tableaus. The results suggest Roman mosaics by way of Brooklyn: “Date Palm Tree (Tree of Paradise)” (2018), a 6-by-2-foot composition in a pine frame, depicts a palm tree with a wiggly trunk and faux-naïve fronds from which hang fruits inlaid with sections of real date pits.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/t-magazine/terrazzo-craft-artisans.html

In 2022, the second of two originals — inspired by a childhood adventure of sneaking into a famed dance hall to watch couples drag and sway to the live performances of Clyde McPhatter or Duke Ellington — came up for auction at Christie’s, selling for $15.3 million. The buyer was the Houston-based energy trader and high-stakes gambler Bill Perkins, 54, who won a bidding war against 22 other prospects. This vast divergence of price belies a convergence of spirit: The countless individuals hanging inexpensive prints on the walls of bedrooms and barbershops share with Perkins (and no doubt with the other wealthy collectors who bid the painting up to more than 76 times its high estimate) an ineluctable desire for the nostalgia and affirmation that Barnes’s work conveys.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/t-magazine/ernie-barnes.html

Both doors open onto long, dark hallways; one runs through the east wing, the other through the west wing. Take a few steps down either hallway, turn south and you’re suddenly standing in a cavernous 1,800-square-foot space: part living room, part dining room and kitchen, all sheathed in Kebony. In place of a back wall, there are 115 feet of sliding glass doors, angled to appear like a massive bay window.

So many times she’s listened to the waiters sing those bars, on her birthday and her brother’s, year after year, every milestone celebrated in that fantastical dining room tricked out with fake trees. Back then, the address was just outside of Chinatown, which emerged in the 1870s within the predominantly Irish and later Italian Five Points slum, at the bracket of Bayard, Mott and Pell Streets. The New York Times first mentions the neighborhood by name in 1880, coolly noting that a few property owners in the area refused to take Chinese tenants, while others demanded rents “considerably above those paid by Christians.” These days, depending on whom you ask, the neighborhood sprawls from Delancey Street down to Chambers Street, west to Broadway and east as far as the river.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/t-magazine/manhattan-chinatown-neighborhood.html

Now taking their place in the canon is the “girlie” — the tongue-in-cheek sobriquet used by so many young women chronicling their lives online. The summer that just blazed by belonged unequivocally to the girls and girlies, cultural archetypes who embodied, in their despondency and their delight, the incongruities of being young and female in America. Unlike the always-hustling girlboss, the girlies do not dream of labor. They pick at “girl dinners,” go on “hot-girl walks” or rot in bed with Sylvia Plath and Ottessa Moshfegh paperbacks. On TikTok, the incubator from which new varieties of “girl” emerge daily, they sort themselves into “city girls” (who know that romance is a game and make their peace with its cruelty) or “lover girls” (who are destined for eternal heartache but won’t let that deter them from searching for love). Their shared vision of tortured femininity and undefinable malaise is not constrained by age.

2023-09-19,Luxurious Takes on Pâté en Croûte,"Pâté en croûte, the centuries-old French dish composed of meat terrine baked in savory pastry, was first developed out of economy as a way to preserve and use up bits of offal. But today, with skilled kitchen staffs in short supply, the labor-intensive delicacy — which requires multiple days of confiting, jellying, laminating and simmering — feels like a luxury item. “I like the technical aspect of it,” says the chef Nicolas Delaroque, 42, who serves a classic rabbit-and-tarragon version modernized with a little less fat and a bit more spice at his restaurant, Maison Nico, in San Francisco. Markus Glocker, 42, of New York’s Koloman, likewise set out to create a lighter take on the original. “You’re not going to feel like you just ate a stone,” he says of his salmon en croûte, in which slices of tramezzini, a fluffy Italian bread, are wrapped around a rare salmon filet slicked with scallop-and-parsley mousse and topped with gherkins and a beet-infused butter. At Melbourne, Australia’s Aru, the pâté en croûte is reminiscent of a fancy bánh mì. Chả lua, a ground Vietnamese pork loaf, is combined with chicken liver pâté for the filling, and the jelly layer between the meat and the pastry is seasoned with rice vinegar, soy sauce and Maggi, an MSG-spiked seasoning. “It’s quite a humbling experience,” says the charcutier George Jephson, 39, of assembling his iteration, which is stuffed with pork belly, confit pork tongue, crisped chicken skin, pistachios and port jelly, and can be found at his East London wine bar, Cadet, and at nearby restaurants, including Chiltern Firehouse. Still, making use of the whole pig, he says, is worth the effort. “I worked 10 years as a butcher, and we didn’t sell a single piece of pork liver,” he says. “Now I sell 60 kilos a week.” — Lauren Joseph",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/t-magazine/luxurious-takes-on-pate-en-croute.html

Not even in Barton’s most delirious dreams could he have envisioned “Cassandro,” about a flamboyant, sequin-clad luchador who takes his ring name from a telenovela. But I bet Barton could have drafted the film’s outline, which uses the same squelchy gym bag of tricks as many underdog sports dramas.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/movies/cassandro-review.html

2023-09-21,Poem: ‘CAIN’,"Ariana Reines’s poem “CAIN” travels in couplets. Each line is like one foot, then another, falling onto the pavement of the city, and with each step, thought itself moves, then transforms. The easy way of seeing the world begins to look like a socially convenient illusion. In its place is something so shocking — and perhaps shockingly out of fashion — that it requires scare quotes. “The truth,” with all its ancient and uneasy heft, appears.

2023-09-21,"At This Vending Machine, Four Quarters Get You One Surprise Artwork","An unusual nigiri will soon be on offer at Bar Miller, a new omakase restaurant in New York City’s East Village: the humble bluefish, sourced from the New York-New Jersey coast, served raw. “Bluefish has this reputation as being a lesser tier, like a poor man’s fish. But if you treat it with care, it’s incredible,” says Jeff Miller, the executive chef. “When it’s in season, it’s rich, fatty and buttery, with a little bit of subtle tuna iron quality.” Featuring bluefish on a sushi menu is surprising when the city is awash with omakase that, like those in Tokyo, offer prestigious (but unsustainable, according to Seafood Watch) fish like bluefin tuna, Japanese yellowtail and Japanese eel. “Sometimes I think my life would be so much easier If I’d gone that route,” Miller says in reference to the classic omakase menu for which there are standard suppliers. Instead, through trial and error, he built a menu entirely from domestic fish. Bar Miller, which is set to open on Sept. 27, serves San Franciscan anchovies, Hudson Valley eel head trout, and Long Island porgy. (The latter, Miller says, tastes sweet and “super subtle [with] a deep oceanic flavor.”) Miller’s attention to local delicacies extends beyond marine life: The restaurant’s sushi rice is farmed in the Hudson Valley; its sushi vinegar is fermented in Pennsylvania; its soy sauce comes from Connecticut. Even its sake is hyperlocal, fermented in Sunset Park and Bushwick. For Miller, sourcing locally is about expanding on his lifelong appreciation of Japanese cuisine; sustainability is an attendant benefit. barmiller.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/t-magazine/anastasia-inciardi-prints-vending-machine.html

The couple would go hunting and fishing at his 100,000-acre Reay Forest estate in the Scottish Highlands, where, on blustery days, the designer often borrowed the duke’s tweed blazers. Eventually, she enlisted the Scottish mill Linton Tweeds to produce her own yardage and, having famously cast aside delicate crepes and muslins, she presented her first cardigan made from the nubby fabric. “I asked wholesalers for natural colors,” she would later recall to the French novelist Paul Morand. “I wanted women to be guided by nature.” Chanel’s bouclé tweeds and tartan ensembles, which were made in monochrome as well as pastel palettes, became synonymous with her refined, ever-so-slightly rugged style.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/t-magazine/chanel-brooch-tweed.html

But when he encountered the work of the 39-year-old Mexico City-based ceramist Perla Valtierra, he felt an immediate connection. Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective — Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration — her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. “What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it,” he says. “That’s what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/t-magazine/gael-garcia-bernal-perla-valtierra.html

We enter this book already aware that our narrator is an untrustworthy one.

2023-09-25,What Is a Gallery?,"Commercial galleries are an old business, and a unique one within the New York City economy, something between a storefront and a salon, the anchor of both a largely unregulated marketplace and of creative expression itself. The earliest examples of galleries in New York, from the first half of the 19th century, predate every major museum and auction house in the metropolitan area, not to mention Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State Building and Grand Central Terminal. This would seem to suggest there is something indelible about galleries in the landscape of this city and, by extension, any truly global city that values culture. That New York has the largest network of galleries in the world is a fact that many observers of the art business simply take for granted: Why does New York have so many galleries? Because it’s the center of the art world. Why is New York the center of the art world?

2023-09-25,Dassai Opens Its Sprawling Sake Brewery in the Hudson Valley,"Dassai, the brand of sake made by Asahi Shuzo in Yamaguchi, in southern Japan, is not new to the United States. But this week its sake produced in the Hudson Valley is making its debut. On Oct. 12, the company’s new sake brewery in Hyde Park, N.Y., a 55,000 square foot complex of rooms for washing and soaking rice, koji-making, drying, steaming, fermenting and bottling, will open its visitor center for tastings and tours by reservation, $50. The facility is producing a few sakes, the first of which, Dassai Blue 50, is now appearing on store shelves and in restaurants. Kazuhiro Sakurai, the company’s president, said that Dassai has partnered with the nearby Culinary Institute of America, which approached them to open the brewery in part to work with its instructors, students and chefs to educate them about sake. Dassai is a supporter of the cooking school. In addition to the brewery’s sprawl of antiseptic white rooms equipped to handle the various stages of sake-making, there is a separate building where the rice for sake is milled at enough of a distance to prevent dust from the process from tainting production. Rice is milled or polished to varying degrees — the more extreme the finer the drink. Dassai Blue 50 refers to the rice grains that are polished to 50 percent of their original size, making the drink a daiginjo. (The company plans to introduce sakes at 35 percent and a 23 percent.) For now the rice is being imported from Japan, but Dassai has begun cultivating the proper variety in Arkansas. Dassai Blue 50 (about $35) is clear, with a fruity, honeydew aroma, and a smooth, slightly sweet flavor. Though most sakes, including Dassai’s imports, have 16 to 17 percent alcohol, Dassai Blue 50 is 14 percent. Mr. Sakurai’s father, Hiroshi Sakurai, the company chairman, said that one of their goals is to make sake more acceptable to accompany cuisines other than Japanese; “a challenge,” he said. The company recommends using stemware, not traditional sake glasses.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/dining/dassai-blue-sake-brewery-hudson-valley.html

Before opening Secret Project Robot on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, Nelson and her partner, Erik Zajaceskowski, spent the last two decades cultivating a distinctly outsider status in the art world. They became serial starters, opening up new spaces to show art that could never quite be described as galleries. In the late 1990s, Zajaceskowski founded an underground D.I.Y. party venue called Mighty Robot. The live shows helped establish the Williamsburg alt scene of the early aughts (bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had some of their first New York performances at Mighty Robot). Nelson and Zajaceskowski consider parties an art form in and of themselves, but also a way to show art. “Originally, we threw parties to encourage people to stay and look at the work,” Zajaceskowski tells me.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/t-magazine/artist-run-galleries-new-york.html

Pale wood counters for dining, and shelves holding all sorts of goods fill the 40-seat room. Alessandro Pepe, a partner in the Roscioli company, is running the New York venture with Ariel Arce, who originally owned Niche Niche in the space. He said Roscioli prides itself on stocking preserved vegetables, olive oils, cheeses, condiments and cured meats from small producers. New York’s outpost will carry both imported and local products, pared down from the hundreds of choices in Rome. The wine bar menu of small plates, pastas, meatballs, supplì alla Romana and focaccia, features many of these products, some of which, with respect to low carbon footprint, arrive from Europe by sailboat. The chefs are Tommaso Fratini from Rome, and Aaron Lirette, who was at Niche Niche. Kenneth Crum, also from Niche Niche, is working with Mr. Pepe and Ms. Arce in developing the wine list.

Two of Farhadi’s subsequent features (“A Separation” and “The Salesman”) won the Oscar for what was then called the best foreign language film, and he has become a reliable, methodical specialist in a certain brand of domestic drama.

2023-09-28,"‘Flora and Son’ Review: Once, With More Feeling","“Flora and Son,” a satisfying demimusical from the Irish writer and director John Carney (“Once,” “Sing Street”), opens with an unexpected blast of techno. This kind of hard, sweaty beat propels our churlish heroine Flora (Eve Hewson), although by the end of the first sequence, it’s clear that the clubbing, and the booze, and the one-night stands have given her a perpetual hangover. Barely in her 30s, the self-destructive single mother is throwing away her future with an assist from her feckless ex, Ian (Jack Reynor, sputtering and hilarious), and their 14-year-old son, Max (Oren Kinlan), a thief and would-be rapper. It’s a testament to Hewson’s extraordinary charisma that her character can openly wish Max would get kidnapped and we root for her anyway. But since she’s saddled with the boy, Flora foists a junked guitar on him as a birthday present. “It’s a piano,” she jokes. The lad is unimpressed.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/movies/flora-and-son-review.html

2023-09-28,A Tasting Room for Black Currant Liquor in Upstate New York,"The Danish chef Mads Refslund first began working on Ilis, his new restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2016. After years of high-profile jobs at places like Manhattan’s Acme and Shou Sugi Ban House in the Hamptons, Refslund, a co-founder of Noma, wanted a permanent space where he could create an immersive culinary experience. The open kitchen, and its live fire grill, is at the center of the 4,800-square foot room on Green Street. The space has 17-foot ceilings with wooden beams and exposed brick walls; custom rosewood tables and leather banquettes frame the perimeter (though a few counter seats provide the best vantage of a meal coming together). “This is about transparency,” Refslund says. The name Ilis is a portmanteau of sorts, with ild meaning “fire” in Danish and is meaning “ice.” It’s a nod to the dichotomous spirit of the restaurant — serious cooking with laid-back dinner party vibes. The menu allows guests to choose from a selection of primary ingredients, say New England scallops or Pennsylvania wild duck, and, in some cases, style of preparation (raw or grilled, for example). The seasonal cuisine is informed by Refslund’s Scandinavian upbringing, as well as his travels to Japan and Mexico City. But, the chef says, “hopefully, it will just become a New York restaurant,” a reflection of the city he now calls home.

My daughter is uncomfortable with this and feels that it gives her an unfair advantage other kids don’t have; she says she wants to apply on her own merit.

Hendricks noticed several well-dressed Black men and women. As Hendricks later explained, he was particularly struck by the fashion sense of two African men.
