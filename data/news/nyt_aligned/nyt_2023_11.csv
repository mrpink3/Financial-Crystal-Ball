Late in his lush, labyrinthine “Same Bed Different Dreams,” Ed Park recreates that moment, twisting the doomed flight’s number into a James Bond motif that resonates throughout the novel. Double agents, sinister corporations, slasher films, U.F.O.s: If Park’s suitcase is stuffed, well, it’s an inspired choice for an odyssey that unpacks, in Pynchonesque fashion, Korean history and American paranoia.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/books/review/same-bed-different-dreams-ed-park.html

Summon memories, if you can, of the Sign of the Dove, Parioli Romanissimo, Mortimer’s, Elaine’s, David K, Quo Vadis, Le Cirque, Jams, Arcadia, An American Place and many more. On the list was a chop house, Hoexter’s Market (two stars from Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times in 1978). It was an adjunct to a butcher shop, also called Hoexter’s Market, both owned by Robert Shapiro who went on to open Flex Mussels in more than one location. Hoexter’s Market, with a checker logo (as in checker cabs, another memory) closed in the mid-80s. But recently, Alexandra Shapiro, a daughter of Mr. Shapiro, and Laura Shapiro, his wife, have been determined to revive Hoexter’s. “It’s been my mission,” Alexandra said. And the family has done it.  Steps from the original location, it has dropped the Market from the name. Enter into the bar, forest green with fanciful wallpaper, then proceed to the main dining room with rough brick and plaid on the walls, tablecloths and a mural showing regulars from the original restaurant. Another dining room beyond has a shimmering chandelier, red leather banquettes and a celestial theme, and doubles as a party space. The chef, Lauren Schwichtenberg, has roots in Oklahoma and Minnesota, and her menu is as contemporary as its double smash cheeseburger. Also on offer are tuna crudo, onion soup, steamed artichoke, chopped salad, pork Milanese, a roast chicken, Faroe Island salmon with smoked beurre blanc and prime rib for two.

In Delhi, India, where Taseer grew up, quick trips for the purpose of worship were commonplace. “People would do a pilgrimage on an ordinary Sunday,” he says, “instead of going to an amusement park.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/t-magazine/travel-behind-the-scenes.html

She is 97, diagnosed with moderate dementia and is considered high risk to be left home alone. We had been applying for Medicaid long-term care to receive a home health aide since early November 2021. She finally got a home health aide in January 2022, but it’s been a nightmare. They are so desperate to hire workers that they will take anyone. She was left without an aide on many random days with a late-notice telephone call or text message from the aide needing the day off and the agencies not able to find a replacement in time. I have changed agencies multiple times. My husband has been a great support the entire time. We rely on security cameras we installed in our apartment to see how she is doing while we are at work. How is it on a daily basis? It is emotionally and physically draining.

It’s insane. The exercise is absurd to begin with,” says Gabriela Cámara, the chef and owner of Contramar and three other restaurants in the Mexican capital, at the outset of the video conversation I’d arranged to do just that: identify the specific meals or bites (or drinks) that best represent the metropolis’s formidable food scene right now. Nonetheless, Cámara was up for the challenge, as were the four other panelists I’d convened, all of whom live in Mexico City either year-round or part time: Ana Dolores, the chef and owner of Esquina Común restaurant in the Condesa neighborhood; Anais Martinez, who founded the Curious Mexican, a street-food tour company, and recently opened Manada, an all-Mexican cocktail and natural wine bar in Narvarte; the food writer Alonso Ruvalcaba, the author of the guide “24 Horas de Comida en la Ciudad de México” (2018); and Carla Valdivia Nakatani, T Magazine’s art director, who splits her time between Manhattan and Mexico City, where she co-owns a boutique in Roma. Before we met as a group, I’d asked each participant to nominate around 10 dishes, including a sweet and a drink, from 10 different spots, ranging from fine-dining restaurants to street carts and market stalls. Then we spent two hours and several subsequent emails and phone calls debating our choices, trying to whittle down the 50-plus nominations to 25 in order to produce a list like those in the ongoing T 25 series devoted to food in Paris and in New York.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/t-magazine/mexico-city-restaurants-food.html

Unlike the usual Eataly template, there are no dining counters in the retail food departments like the pizzeria or butcher. The restaurant’s wine list and menu are thoroughly Italian, with beef carpaccio, cold seafood salad, radicchio salad, tagliatelle Bolognese, rigatoni carbonara, lasagna with mushroom ragù and various pizzas. The market side of the establishment sells groceries like sauces, oils, pastas and condiments, including some newly anointed with Eataly’s private label. Fresh food like produce, meats, seafood, cheeses and charcuterie is all prepackaged.

So far things were going great. He had met all the stars and players, was widely feted as the next in line to save the eternally struggling industry and was well into the process of renovating a landmark house in Beverly Hills. “You’re the dog that caught the bus,” the billionaire octogenarian cable pioneer John Malone, one of Discovery’s largest shareholders, told him.

But that approach is changing as designers are increasingly placing moss in the spotlight, embracing it as a substitute for evergreens in holiday wreaths or draping swaths of it across mantels and tabletops.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/t-magazine/moss-flowers-arrangements.html

2023-11-21,Figure Eight Takes a Southern Approach to Chinese Cuisine,"Emmeline Zhao, an owner of Silver Apricot, where Chinese food is interpreted through a new American lens, has created her own competition. Next door to Silver Apricot she has opened this new spot, in the brick-walled premises that previously housed the beloved Pearl Oyster Bar. “So far the two restaurants seem to reinforce each other,” Ms. Zhao said. “We’ve had people come here for a drink and a snack, because Silver Apricot doesn’t have a bar, and then have dinner at Silver Apricot.” The Chinese American approach, intended to express something of the immigrant experience, is given a narrower frame than at Silver Apricot, with emphasis on the Southern Atlantic region where Ms. Zhao, a North Carolina native, was raised. So you’ll find turnip tots with lap cheong mayo and shrimp ketchup; shrimp cocktail with Chinese horseradish; Hong Shao collard greens with pork belly and Thai chile; grilled branzino; soy-poached chicken with collard greens and crispy hoppin’ John; and hot fried skate with chile crisp, buttermilk ranch dressing and sesame biscuits. Like its sibling, the tables are not set with chopsticks but they can be requested. The executive chef, Calvin Hwang, who grew up in New Jersey, worked at Crown Shy and Saga. The pastry chef, Janice Sung, was at Saga and One White Street; among her creations is a banana custard pie seasoned with Chinese five-spice. The restaurant has three areas. At the entrance is a 12-seat bar with a standing rail and a jazzy dragon splashed across the wall. The main dining room is done mostly in blue and white in homage, Ms. Zhao said, to Pearl Oyster Bar’s seafood. And there’s an intimate semiprivate room.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Our Trip to Orlando Was Ruined and We Want Our Money Back.,"This past June, my wife and I, along with two of our children, flew from our home in India to the eastern United States to see family and visit Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. The trip included three domestic flights over five days on Frontier Airlines: Philadelphia to Orlando, Orlando to Atlanta, and Atlanta back to Philadelphia. The total cost for four people on three flights was an affordable $939.75, including a $99.99 “Discount Den” membership on Frontier. (We also spent $1,269.52 on tickets at Universal.) But our first flight was delayed and eventually canceled, and Frontier’s staff told us the next available flight was three or four days later — too close to our return flight to India. We were given a QR code at the Philadelphia airport to file for a refund, which we did for all three flights. But all we got was an email with a credit worth $339.92 and good for three months, plus four additional messages with a $100 voucher for each of us. Since Frontier does not operate in India, the credit and vouchers are useless. I fought Frontier through my Discover card, but lost. (Meanwhile, Universal reimbursed us in full.) Can you help?

2023-11-27,The Ceramists Putting a Fresh Spin on Traditional Korean Techniques,"The Brooklyn-based ceramic artist Eun-Ha Paek’s pieces are defined by their renegade spirit. A recent work, a foot-high stoneware form, resembles a child’s stick-figure drawing, but with a Surrealist bent: Instead of a head, it has a blue-and-white delftware-style dinner plate; instead of eyes, there are painted butterflies. “I like combining serve ware with food shapes, as if elements of a meal had come together and were having a dinner party,” says Paek, who builds her works’ hollow extremities, including legs that look like hot dogs, with a machine called an extruder and molds other parts by hand before coating the finished forms with cobalt and iron oxide washes and glazes. The pieces reflect Paek’s training in animation, film and video at the Rhode Island School of Design — now in New York, she teaches ceramics at Doclay and at Greenwich House, and illustration at the Parsons School of Design — as well as her upbringing. Born in Seoul, she immigrated to Los Angeles with her family when she was 9 and was dazzled by the new culture she encountered there. “The first place we went was to a drive-through for hamburgers,” she says. “I think my parents saw it as a symbol of having made it, to live in a country where food was brought to your car.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/t-magazine/korean-ceramics-art.html

Gerwig and Baumbach’s wise screenplay delicately dramatizes how Brooke first seems like Tracy’s platonic ideal of the young urban woman, then slowly reveals herself as messy in a multitude of ways. Gerwig’s multilayered performance is one of her best, while Baumbach orchestrates the picture’s shifts from character drama to door-slamming farce with bouncy ease.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/movies/mistress-america-tramps-streaming-movies.html

It was a year when many of the best songs came from looking inward: at tricky relationships, at memories, at individual hopes and fears. Yet in the music, introspection led to exploration: expanding and toying with sonic possibilities, enjoying the way every note is now an infinitely flexible digital choice. For me, there was no overwhelming, year-defining album; this list could just as well be alphabetical. Instead, 2023 was a year of artists going in decidedly individual (and group) directions to grapple with their own questions, risks and rewards.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/arts/music/best-albums-2023.html

The name Lannan comes from a Gaelic word meaning “house,” and Maher’s choice of baked goods is intentionally nostalgic. Staples include an apple-and-custard-filled croissant and a custard slice with pink sour cherry icing. “Growing up, we made a chocolate sponge with little crunchy flaked almonds for birthdays,” Maher says. “We’d pour ganache over the top and I thought it was the most amazing thing to see it drip down the side.” (The chocolate cake at Lannan is now made with buttermilk and rye.) Maher, who grew up in the Scottish Borders with an artist mother and a scientist father, appreciates the way baking fuses creativity and precision. It takes three days to produce all the laminated dough pastries in preparation for the bakery’s Thursday through Sunday open hours. After the pain Suisse or crème brûlée Danishes disappear, inevitably by around 9 a.m., out come the cakes (from fig leaf sponge to quince Bundt), jambon beurres and finally a few sliced-up Roman pizzas and oatmeal raisin cookies. instagram.com/lannanbakery.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/t-magazine/lannan-bakery-edinburgh-scotland.html

So delicious! OMG So easy!” raves Charlotte Thacker, a reader — exactly what we want for a casual dinner thing.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/dining/fuss-free-and-fancy-feeling.html
