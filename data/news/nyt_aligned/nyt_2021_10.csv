2021-10-01,A Classic Clutch With a New Twist,"Bottega Veneta began in 1966 as a leather-goods company based in the Italian town of Vicenza, focused on quiet sophistication and meticulous craftsmanship. Nearly a decade later, the brand debuted a collection of handbags, made by artisans in the Veneto region, using a centuries-old weaving method called intrecciato, meaning “intertwined.” That style — which involves interlocking long, fettuccine-thin strips of leather into a braided pattern that resembles a lattice pie crust — quickly became the leitmotif of the house, known for refraining from logos altogether. In the ’80s, Lauren Hutton carried one of its intrecciato clutches in “American Gigolo” (1980), and Andy Warhol, who often turned to Bottega for his Christmas shopping, was photographed holding up a braided loafer in a department store. (The artist was such a fan of the brand that he produced a short film for the company in 1985.) To teach future artisans the intrecciato method, which takes up to three years of training to master, Bottega partnered with the Scuola d’Arte e Mestieri in Vicenza, an institution devoted to handmaking crafts such as leather goods.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/t-magazine/bottega-veneta-bag.html

A searing ultramarine, it references the celestial blue of Afrofuturism and, with its throne-like shape and spear-modeled armrests (an iklwa is a short stabbing spear innovated by the Zulu nation in the 19th century), is intended to invoke authority and entitlement. A more personal aspect is at play as well: The blue is the same shade as the tailored suit that Collins’s grandfather Clifton wore when he immigrated to England from Jamaica in 1955 as part of what is known in the UK as the Windrush Generation.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/mac-collins-furniture-design.html
2021-10-04,The Artist Who Dreamed Up a Kaleidoscopic Basketball Court for London’s Canary Wharf,"Having grown up in a vibrant multicultural community of immigrants in London, Yinka Ilori was acutely aware of color from a young age. “I would go to these parties and see a cluster of my mom’s friends wearing pink, and another cluster of women wearing purple, and the men wearing green,” recalls the 34-year-old Nigerian-British artist and designer, describing how groups of friends would purchase the same fabric and orchestrate matching outfits for celebrations. Those early memories of “color blocking,” as he calls it, eventually found vivid expression in Ilori’s work: The artist uses kaleidoscopic hues and energetic shapes in an eclectic range of projects, from architecture and furniture to public sculpture and urban interventions. Whether he’s creating carnivalesque cultural and social spaces (like his summer installation in the courtyard of London’s historic Somerset House) or reimagining forgotten elements of the cityscape (swathing a dreary underpass in rainbow tones), he seeks to spark euphoria and foster connection via an aesthetic that marries the sensory richness of his Nigerian heritage with pristine yet provocative designs.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/yinka-ilori-art-design.html

Ly showed me some garden roses, plucking them out of a water bucket and pinching their petals delicately between her fingers as she pointed out the complex, open structure that differentiates them from more tightly petaled varieties. “I love romantic flowers,” she said. “I love having the chance to be around a lush, really overgrown, gushy world.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/doan-ly-floral-design.html

2021-10-04,An Artist Couple Who Live Among the Furniture They Create Together,"For the artists Chris Johanson and Johanna Jackson, the border between art and design is as blurred as that between work and life. The couple, based in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, have been married for 18 years and have worked under the same roof, more or less, since first striking up a friendship in a San Francisco bookstore in the ’90s. And though the bulk of their oeuvres are distinct — Johanson is considered a linchpin of the Mission School, the post-punk movement that borrowed from both graffiti and folk art, for his colorful semi-figurative paintings, while Jackson is known for exploring the poetic and surrealist potential of handmade household objects, as with a U-shaped porcelain candelabra or a sculpture that incorporates sweaters she hand-knit — the couple have also been quietly collaborating for a decade on collage-like salvaged-wood furniture and functional structures, which populate their own home and studios. This fall, some of these pieces will make their way into his-and-hers solo shows in New York (Johanson’s opens in October at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, Jackson’s in November at Tennis Elbow at The Journal Gallery), each offering an immersive view of the artists’ range and overlap during this recent housebound era.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/chris-johanson-johanna-jackson.html
2021-10-04,A Textile Designer Who Draws on Art History and Neuroscience,"As a child, Ellen Van Dusen became fixated on the kinetic colors in the artist Ellsworth Kelly’s paintings, which she’d come upon during her frequent museum visits in Washington, D.C., where she grew up. She was puzzled by Kelly’s abstract minimalist works, several of which comprise flat, solid stretches of a single shade; “I was like, ‘It’s just a green canvas; what’s wrong with my brain?’” says the 35-year-old owner of the textiles and home-accessories brand Dusen Dusen. Such questions stuck with her when she was an undergraduate at Tufts, where she majored in a multidisciplinary mix of art history, neuroscience and visual anthropology. “I studied the visual process from different angles,” she says. “Neuroscience is where I focused on vision: how things come through the eye, how they’re processed through the brain and what evolutionarily draws the eye.” But she kept coming back to color.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/ellen-van-dusen-design.html
2021-10-04,How a Design Devotee Turned Her Passion Into a Thriving Business,"Maggie Holladay was a collector of design objects with a serious tchotchke-hoarding habit — accumulating marble ashtrays and espresso demitasses by the dozen, to cite just two examples — when her then boyfriend staged an intervention. His advice was to stop amassing and start selling. Holladay agreed, and before long she’d graduated from knickknacks to more substantial pieces. “I started out with little marketplace finds, but then found one amazing item and made a huge profit off it,” she says; it was a modular channel bouclé sofa she sold to the model Elsa Hosk, who bought it prior to an Architectural Digest shoot featuring her SoHo apartment. That such a transaction was eminently iterative was not lost on her: “I repeated this process of saving up to buy one really great item and reselling it,” she says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/maggie-holladay-claude-home.html

For Arati Rao, the founder of the Brooklyn-based rug and textiles company Tantuvi, the site is a wonder — partly because though it looks like a contemporary art installation, it was actually built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century. “It always just blows my mind,” she says. “The curves, the lines — it feels so modern and fresh.” It’s a place that Rao, 39, goes on almost every trip she makes to India (pre-pandemic, she would typically visit once or twice a year) and that frequently sparks inspiration for her creations, which have abstract and geometric properties of their own.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/arati-rao-tantuvi-rugs.html

Is that big enough? Does that make sense? Do I want — ’” At this point in reciting his list of self-prompts, the 27-year-old broke out into a crash of laughter. “I’ve always gotten into trouble for being overly analytic,” he’d tell me, later in our conversation. Nonetheless, it’s a quality that drives him. Olunkwa, whose practice includes furniture design, architecture, editing, writing and producing the occasional radio show, is ceaselessly probing and interrogating the world around him — and the world he wants to create.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/emmanuel-olunknwa-pinup-design.html

If his work space leaves an inchoate impression on this August afternoon, it’s likely because the 32-year-old designer hasn’t had time to fully inhabit it, having quit his job at the prestigious design firm Studio Giancarlo Valle only a few weeks earlier in order to become a furniture designer full-time. His decision to venture out on his own was the culmination of a heady year and a half, during which Kim established himself as one of the most sought-after furniture makers in the contemporary design space, using primarily wood and fiberglass to fashion chairs, tables, lamps and cabinets possessed of a poetic, off-kilter presence. “It’s very wild,” he says of his recent dizzying ascent. “It gives me some anxiety, too, because I feel like it could go away so easily.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/t-magazine/minjae-kim-furniture-design.html

When our daughter was born with a full head of dark hair and almond-shaped eyes, the nurses all commented on how much she looked like her father, which, I admit, felt a bit unsettling, not because of any racial shame but because it has always been difficult for me to see myself in anyone or anything other than myself. But now, while my wife slept at night, I would stand over our daughter’s bassinet, compare her face at one week with photos of myself at that delicate, lumpen age and worry about what it might mean to have an Asian-looking baby in this America rather than one who could either pass or, at the very least, walk around with the confidence of some of the half-Asian kids I had met — tall, beautiful, with strange names and a hard edge to their intelligence.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/magazine/asian-american-identity.html

White heads rose up from dusty Jeeps and dark hair thrashed in a harsh new wind like tattered flags. OURS! the men shouted. Their rifles gleamed as if they’d only just been bought: a megastore militia. Through a hasty breach in MaViolet’s blinds, I even saw a boy among them, blond and sneering in a pickup window. Men leapt from back seats, sprang out of truck beds, and rushed toward the faces of our homes. White hands clutched metal canisters, swung torches spilling flames. Bright shouts, the rising haze of smoke— all that and more rousted us out. From our patchy front yards, we saw bodies blur as some of our neighbors charged forward to try to stop them. We saw a teen struck with the butt of a rifle, his temple spraying red. A toddler flailed, diapered and clinging to its mother’s hip as she sank knees first to the sidewalk.

Starting around dusk (depending on where in the world you are, how warm the day, the ponderousness of clouds), the pale, waxy buds, which resemble elongated artichokes, start to open, the pink-tipped sepals peeling back millimeter by millimeter until, by midnight, the secret is told: the blossom announcing itself, so white it seems to glow, with skinny yellow streamers at its throat.

Like most of her ideas, that purse, dubbed the 2.55 (to commemorate the month and year it was introduced), had feminist underpinnings: The strap allowed women to keep their hands free instead of clutching a handle. In 1983, Karl Lagerfeld, the label’s longtime creative director, subtly updated the 2.55, replacing the simple twist Mademoiselle clasp with interlocking C’s, and would go on to make other modifications. The reinterpreted bag was named the 11.12, evoking the internal style code of Lagerfeld’s medium-size version, the A01112. But while the shape of the purse has remained consistent through the decades, Chanel continues to iterate its embellishments, capitalizing on the house’s small specialist craft ateliers, called Métiers d’art.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/t-magazine/chanel-embroidered-flap-bag.html

It’s named for Robert Whittle Dowling, a former owner of the hotel and an influential urban planner. The room has shed the somewhat fussy country house décor of its previous iteration as the Carlyle Restaurant in favor of a sleeker 1940s look in black, white, silver and lime, more supper club than dining room. The walls are covered with photos, graphics and paintings, many of them vintage, including the Bemelmans prints. There’s also a new chef in charge, Sylvain Delpique, formerly of the “21” Club, whose menu is stylishly conservative, befitting the Upper East Side, with foie gras terrine, tuna tartare, a wedge salad, roast chicken and, given tableside flourish, Dover sole and steak Diane. Béarnaise sauce replaces ketchup or mayo for dipping the waffle fries. His excellent chicken paillard from “21” is also on the menu. “I’ve brought over a few dishes, things I like to prepare,” he said. The walls of a cozy bar, a prelude to the restaurant, are sheathed in bright, glossy tortoise shell pattern.

Recall, first, that in many states it was illegal for an enslaved person even to learn how to read and how to write. Then the barbarities of the slave trade, the Middle Passage and cradle-to-grave bondage, were followed by another century of lynching, Jim Crow segregation, disenfranchisement and officially sanctioned forms of violence. Does the English language fail us, Baldwin wonders, in the face of racist terror? No, he decides; we must embrace it, occupy it, refashion it in our images, speak it in our own voices. We must deploy it to redress this terror. “To accept one’s past — one’s history,” as Baldwin insisted, “is not the same as drowning with it; it is learning how to use it.” This, surely, is integral to the freedom to write — the freedom to bear witness to the full range of our common humanity, and all that that entails, no matter how uncomfortable the process can be.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/books/review/freedom-literary-expression-henry-louis-gates.html

Everywhere you turn, you see images of his latest film role. They show what appears to be a high school student, only there’s something strange about him, an odd fusion of boy and man. He wears a striped polo shirt and springy ringlets of hair that, observers insist, absolutely must be a wig. Sometimes you’re offered a still picture of him sobbing, his expression wrenched and tortured — the way a stage actor, exaggerating for Broadway’s rearmost seats, might portray grief. Sometimes it’s a seven-second video in which Platt stammers and then takes off running down a high school hallway — an awkward jog, somehow both hypnotic and bewildering, from a 28-year-old who has been playing the same 17-year-old, onstage and now in film, for some seven years.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/magazine/movie-memes.html

He wrote poems about God and nature and other grand things befitting, he believed, the stately tenor of verse. His workshop companions were high school and college students; a mother who brought her restless child along, equipped with crayons and a coloring book; young professionals coming directly from downtown jobs — all Black and brown women and men, some 50 strong, for whom poetry was an unruly thing that could break lines, hold picket signs, make love and cuss.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/t-magazine/black-art-collectives-creators.html

2021-10-13,A Bulgari Necklace With a Jazz Age Flair,"The tassel has been used as decoration at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians — one made of gold and silver was found in the tomb of Tutankhamen — but for fine jewelers, its heyday was the 1920s, when hemlines rose to the knee as waistlines and necklines plunged. The flapper’s boyish silhouette became the ideal, leading to the popularity of the sautoir, a long necklace often ending in a tassel, strung with tiny pearls or gemstones, that nestled against the breastbone. It could be twirled languidly as one stood in sophisticated conversation during the cocktail hour — a ritual that was born during that heady era. Bulgari, the Rome-based house founded in 1884 by the Greek silversmith Sotirio Bulgari, was responsible for creating iconic versions of such Jazz Age passementerie, and has never stopped innovating the form. A dangling tassel is the focus of this new jewel-encrusted convertible sautoir, which can be worn nine ways, including as a brooch, pendant or choker, and features a 10-carat antique cushion-cut ruby from Mozambique.

Ellis and Gordon S. Wood) or the hopes of a high school basketball team during an epidemic of suicides on a Native American reservation (in “Brothers on Three,” by Abe Streep). Fiona Hill’s memoir of an up-from-the-bootstraps British immigrant who becomes an expert analyst on the National Security Council, only to testify in the impeachment trial of an American president? That’s part of the experiment. So is Andrea Elliott’s “Invisible Child,” her minutely observed profile of a New York schoolgirl struggling against the scourge of homelessness.

The Birkin would be bigger than the Kelly, but smaller than the Haut à Courroies, and contain interior pockets for storing belongings, as well as a burnished flap top with the house’s signature saddle stitching and a turn-lock swivel clasp.

Tending the perennial beds and clipping the yew hedges at the house — sometimes still in pajamas or late into the evening — she often finds herself thinking about the death-and-resurrection cycles that have taken place there through the centuries, and of the literary gardeners who have shaped her and her work. In her mind, they are as alive as the white roses that climb her new home’s 18th-century white-plastered brick facade.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/t-magazine/england-garden-olivia-laing.html

The technique is bare bones, leaving no option for adjusting the texture to taste: lightly sauté the rice in extra-virgin olive oil (included), then add a measured amount of boiling salted water all at once and cook, stirring. The cheese and butter go in at the end, and the licorice gets dusted on just before serving. The kit is designed to serve three, but can accommodate four.

2021-10-19,How the American Right Fell in Love With Hungary,"For one week this summer, Fox News beamed the face of Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary into the homes of Tucker Carlson’s 3.2 million viewers. In a two-tiered library adorned with dark wood and the Hungarian flag, Carlson sat across from the prime minister in Budapest with an expression of intense concentration, though he evinced little familiarity with the internal affairs of Hungary. The trip was hastily arranged after Orban agreed to the interview: Carlson dined at the prime minister’s office the evening before the broadcast, and earlier in the week, he was taken in a military helicopter to a tightly controlled area along the country’s southern border, generally off limits to journalists, in the presence of a Hungarian minister. There, Hungary became the idealized backdrop for Carlson’s habitual preoccupations: Thanks to a barbed-wire fence, Hungary’s border area was “perfectly clean and orderly,” free of the “trash” and “chaos” that mark other borders of the world. Consequently, “There weren’t scenes of human suffering.” He did not bring up the fact that civic groups have repeatedly taken the Hungarian government to court for denying food to families held in immigration detention centers.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/magazine/viktor-orban-rod-dreher.html

This means the conversations parents need to have with their older kids about marijuana have a new wrinkle. The good news is that many of the tactics used to navigate other tricky topics with teens can be deployed to talk about why edibles are not as harmless as they might look.

Here, Mexican ingredients and their own corn tortillas will be for sale. To make their tortillas, they are importing more than a dozen varieties of heirloom corn in a rainbow of colors; about 20,000 pounds, in sacks, are stacked throughout the premises. A glassed-in, tortilla-making area is adjacent to the future shop; beyond is the dining room and bar. Mr. Wangeman came from Oaxaca right after high school and studied at the Culinary Institute of America to become a pastry chef, and worked at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain and Per Se in New York. He returned home to deepen his understanding of Mexican cuisine, and later, back in New York, opened pop-ups featuring traditional Mexican ingredients. His wife, a physician whose mother, Carina Santiago Bautista, is the owner and chef of Tierra Antigua near Oaxaca, joined him in the business.

One is tempted to say that it could scarcely have come at a more awkward time — what with the conventions, the exhibition of candidates, the dubious state of this particular and perhaps increasingly dubious union, and the American attempt, hopelessly and predictably schizophrenic, of preventing total disaster, for white people and for the West, in South Africa. There is a carefully muffled pain and panic in the nation, which neither candidate, neither party, can coherently address, being, themselves, but vivid symptoms of it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/review/roots-alex-hale.html

In some cases, such views are rewarding; in others, unforgettable. In any event, one sees things somewhat differently, especially if the reporting is done with an irreverent eye, a waspish tongue and a “no holds barred” attitude to customary villains, heroes, strategy and tactics. By dint of these talents, Jane Jacobs achieves a brashly impressive tour de force in her reinterpretation of the problems and needs of the contemporary metropolis.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/review/jane-jacobs-death-and-life-great-american-cities.html
2021-10-21,Essay: ‘The Second Shelf’,"If “The Marriage Plot,” by Jeffrey Eugenides, had been written by a woman yet still had the same title and wedding ring on its cover, would it have received a great deal of serious literary attention? Or would this novel (which I loved) have been relegated to “Women’s Fiction,” that close-quartered lower shelf where books emphasizing relationships and the interior lives of women are often relegated? Certainly “The Marriage Plot,” Eugenides’s first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Middlesex,” was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about women’s lives never find a way to escape “Women’s Fiction” and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men, are prominently displayed and admired.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/meg-wolitzer-second-shelf.html

He advises us also never to tell another person that he is wrong, but adds that if we are wrong ourselves we can turn a liability into an asset by admitting it “quickly and emphatically.” If we do all that, we are pretty sure to win friends.

The materials of “The Makioka Sisters,” widely regarded as the most important Japanese novel since the Second World War, are therefore quite familiar to us in the West. In its massive and tender reconstruction of a moment in social history, its day-to-day explicitness, its full but swiftly evocative dialogue, its psychological directness, it is like the work of a very fertile but conservative novelist of our own culture.

Fire and firestorms have consumed forests and cities, and from the fall of ashes and soot everything is gray, the river water black.

Probably the novel reflects a national tendency. To be sure, after we have carefully separated ourselves from the soil, we are apt to talk a lot about the advantages of a return to it, but in most cases it ends there.

He must also value experience and have a truth-telling nature. I think I have that. In their youth most people worry whether or not other people will like them. Not me. I had the choice of going under or surviving, and I survived by understanding (after the iron — if not the silver — had entered my soul) that it is I who am keeping score. What matters is what I think, not what others think of me; and I am willing to say what I think. That is the critical temperament.

One might be inclined to assume that Smith, who began writing the book when still a Cambridge undergraduate, has bitten off more than she can chew; one might even feel a little huffy that one so young (she is 24) has aimed so high.

He tells what happens to a farmer’s daughter from Wisconsin who went to Chicago almost as a child, and there to seek her level in the world.

Anne Boleyn, the tease eager to supplant her, won’t let the king know what she’s wearing until their wedding night; she says “yes, yes, yes” to him, “then she says no.” Thomas More, willing to go to any lengths to prevent the marriage, wears a shirt of bristling horsehair, which mortifies his flesh until the sores weep. As for Thomas Cromwell, the fixer who does the king’s dirty work just as he once did the cardinal’s, what is he hiding under his lawyer’s sober winter robes?

Yet, firm as they both were in achievement and promise, they didn’t fully forecast her new book, “Song of Solomon.” Here the depths of the younger work are still evident, but now they thrust outward, into wider fields, for longer intervals, encompassing many more lives. The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family. In short, this is a full novel — rich, slow enough to impress itself upon us like a love affair or a sickness — not the two-hour penny dreadful which is again in vogue nor one of the airless cat’s cradles custom-woven for the delight and job-assistance of graduate students of all ages.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/review/song-of-solomon-toni-morrison.html

As to just why, it would take an expert in the subconscious and a corps of child psychologists fully to determine. Not the intoxication of words which keep “tumbling into rhyme,” as one little girl neatly described it; not the irresistible rhythm of such songs as “Bring me bread, bring me butter” and “Round is around,” nor the fun which flashes out when least expected, can fully explain its success. Perhaps it is because, in addition to these virtues, Miss Stein has caught within this architectural structure of words which rhyme and rhyme again the essence of certain moods of childhood: the first exploration of one’s own personality, the feeling of lostness in a world of night skies and mountain peaks.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/review/famous-authors-childrens-books.html
2021-10-21,"Review: ‘The Complete Stories,’ by Flannery O’Connor","The title sums up author, book and life: “Flannery O’Connor: The Complete Stories.” She died in 1964 at the age of 39; she published 31 stories, of which 12 have been uncollected until now. Now they are all in one book, arranged in chronological order from the stories she wrote for her master’s thesis at the University of Iowa to “Judgment Day,” a harrowing version of her brilliant early story about an elderly Southerner’s exile in New York, “The Geranium.” Since the stories here include the original openings and other chapters of her two novels, “Wise Blood” and “The Violent Bear It Away,” and since stories were more natural to her than novels, we do have almost all of Flannery O’Connor “complete” here. Especially when you reflect that the driving characteristic of her style, her mind, her particular faith, was to find people “complete” in the smallest gesture, or in a moment’s involuntary action that could decide a life forever.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/books/review/flannery-oconnor-the-complete-stories.html

Or did he just simply take all the strings off that scientific imagination of his and let it riot unrestrained with his central idea?

2021-10-22,The Enduring Appeal of Laura Ashley,"In 1952, a 28-year-old secretary attended a traditional handicrafts exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Inspired especially by the hand-printed fabrics she encountered there, the young woman returned home and told her husband that she had never seen anything like them in stores, and wanted to try making some similar styles herself. The pair spent 10 pounds on wood for a screen, dyes and linen and, after poring over a handful of instructional library books, began silk-screening textiles at the kitchen table of their small London flat. The following year, while awaiting the birth of their first child, they printed scarves, largely because they had just returned from a trip to Italy, where young girls were emulating Audrey Hepburn’s character in “Roman Holiday” (1953) and knotting them around their necks. Orders from high street shops soon flooded in. Next, they made tea towels, napkins and place mats with simple geometric patterns. Not long after, in March 1954, the couple, Laura and Bernard Ashley, officially founded Ashley Mountney Ltd. — Mountney being Laura’s maiden name. Eventually, though, Bernard felt that an unambiguously feminine-sounding moniker would better suit their products, and they rechristened the company Laura Ashley.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/t-magazine/laura-ashley-batsheva.html

Now that I’m older, have suffered more and realize my life is likely more than half over, it’s her seriousness, her coldness, that appeals. Some days, and in the dark intervals between days, it seems to me that Glück’s preoccupations are what poetry is for, that poems are confrontations with the void. If we’re on a moving walkway approaching the void, we can ignore it, avoid all thoughts of it, for only so long.

In 1996, he co-founded the influential arts and culture magazine Index. And between 2002 and 2011, he served as the director of Yale’s M.F.A. painting program. But he is best known for his often gargantuan neon abstract canvases, which he has made in subtly varying forms for four decades (a show of his recent works is currently on view at Dallas Contemporary). Comprising cell-like shapes connected by “conduits,” his paintings are at once luminous and austere, with textured surfaces he laboriously builds up using layers of acrylic frequently mixed with Roll-a-Tex, a surfacing material for houses. A native New Yorker, he works mostly from a 5,000-square-foot studio in West Chelsea, a former industrial building filled with buckets of Day-Glo paint and bins of splattered rollers. But his studio in Connecticut, a modest two-story house wrapped in black-stained shingles that he bought and renovated in 2010, and where he now spends a few days each week, is a very different kind of work space. It serves as both a refuge for making the 17-by-22-inch studies on which his large-scale paintings are based — a meditative process he likens to composing music but with colors instead of chords — and as a memory palace of sorts, filled with furniture and objects from each chapter of his life.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/t-magazine/peter-halley-design-art-collection.html

Shut out from the New York papers since the calamitous article about the JOUAM parade in the summer of ’92, he had chanced upon the right person in Edward Marshall, and even if the encounter cost him a miserable week in bed, Marshall’s position as Sunday editor of the Press gave him the power to open the door and allow Crane back into the world of journalism. Marshall was just two years older than Crane, and beyond having the wit to recognize talent when he saw it, he was a generational ally who understood what was new and original in Crane’s work. Five days after Crane died at a sanatorium in the Black Forest on June 5, 1900, Marshall wrote a stunned, tight-lipped article for the New York Herald (“Loss of Stephen Crane—A Real Misfortune to All of Us”) that focused mainly on their wartime experiences together in Cuba but also touched on Crane’s first visit to the Potter Building: “One day . . . a young man came to my office with a letter of introduction.
