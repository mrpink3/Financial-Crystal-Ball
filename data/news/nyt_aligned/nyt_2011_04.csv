2011-04-01,The Illustrator of ‘I Stink!’ Shows Off his More Elegant Work,"Parents of small children probably know James McMullan as the creator (along with his wife, Kate) of the popular picture book “I Stink!” about the nightly rounds of a profoundly disgusting but hard-working New York City garbage truck. He is also enshrined in disco lore for the paintings he did more than 30 years ago for New York magazine that became the visual inspiration for “Saturday Night Fever.” But these days Mr. McMullan is much better known for the elegantly expressive show posters he makes for Lincoln Center Theater. And this week a large selection of those posters – for plays and musicals like “Ah! Wilderness,” “Carousel” and “South Pacific” – went on display near the theater they helped promote, at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, on Lincoln Center Plaza off Amsterdam Avenue near 64th Street. The posters, as well as preliminary sketches, photographs and watercolor and gouache studies, will remain on view at the library through June 11, and on April 4, Mr. McMullan will join fellow theatrical graphic artist Frank Verlizzo, known as Fraver, at the library for a discussion about the living art of poster-making.

Offered as main selections would be Feynman’s autobiographical rambles (as told to Ralph Leighton), “ ‘Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!’ ” and “ ‘What Do You Care What Other People Think?’ ” For alternate selections, readers could choose from his more serious works, like “QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter” — a spirited account of the counterintuitive behavior of the quantum world — and the legendary “Feynman Lectures on Physics.” Whatever the man said had swagger.

Like a hermit crab that has outgrown its shell, a refugee must seize the best shelter he can before another needy creature is able to grab it. Nevertheless, in David Bezmozgis’s first novel, “The Free World,” set in Rome in 1978, a proud Soviet Jewish émigré couple, seeking visas, take offense when a clerk in the briefing department asks for their “Persecution Story.” “What do we need this for?” the wife asks. “Nobody’s saying you need it,” the clerk explains. “The Americans need it. You’re claiming refugee status. To be a refugee you need to have been persecuted.” To which the wife indignantly retorts: “The entire country was persecuted.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/books/review/book-review-the-free-world-by-david-bezmozgis.html
2011-04-01,Les Murray and the Poetry of Depression,"The signature quality of a Les Murray poem is anger — a visceral smoldering that freshly lights up the tired old landscape and turns conventional pieties inside out. A lifelong outsider and champion of the underdog, Murray grew up among impoverished farmers in rural Australia, where, as an overweight “redneck” teenager, he was mercilessly tormented at school. Today he is the closest thing Australia has to a national poet. A sui generis autodidact (he now suspects he has Asperger’s syndrome) equipped with a fierce moral vision and a sensuous musicality, he writes subtly about post­colonialism, urban sprawl and poverty and, in his most intimate poems, reminds us of the power of literature to transubstantiate grievance into insight. (His admirers have argued he ought to be considered for a Nobel.) But he is equally capable of writing emotionally simplistic and strangely soured poems in which the enraged adolescent emerges all but unmediated. This mercurial doubleness can make his work hard to categorize or describe: this is a mind at once revolutionary and reactionary. Or maybe just a poet who’s willing to show more id than most.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/books/review/les-murray-and-the-poetry-of-depression.html

A while later, as the midwife collected her fee, Xinran noticed a movement in the slops bucket. “To my absolute horror,” she recalls, “I saw a tiny foot poking out of the pail.” But she was the only one who was shocked. “It’s not a child,” the headman’s wife told her. “If it was, we’d be looking after it, wouldn’t we?

The war and the Holocaust forced millions of civilians across national frontiers. Afterward, multitudes of ethnic Germans were expelled from Eastern Europe and many of the Jews in Poland fled from a new wave of persecution there. Those lucky enough to survive these migrations faced months and years in limbo as the authorities wrestled with the logistical, political and moral difficulties involved in returning them home — or in finding them a new one.

(She liked to say she was the organization’s “most-threatened-with-court-­martial person.”) Instead Coughlin poured her a drink and asked if she would volunteer to report on the postwar transition in Java. Wouldn’t she! Foster, who spoke Malay and had lived in Batavia, had already told a friend about her “confidential plan” to infiltrate a small Indonesian island and emerge as “the Great White Queen of Bali.” The friend half-believed her.

Vowell also includes an exegesis of the cheesy 1987 surf flick “North Shore,” but insists she approaches wave-riding as a purely spectator sport. “I do love watching surfers,” she said in an e-mail. “I’m especially entranced by that moment they gather together offshore waiting for a wave. Maybe they’re out there talking trash, but from the sand it’s the perfect image of camaraderie. In the book I quote a hula scholar friend who calls surfing, like hula, quintessentially Hawaiian. The missionaries thought hula was ‘satanic.’ They were less offended by surfing. I read one missionary diatribe that predicted it would die out once the Hawaiians became accustomed to being fully clothed.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/books/review/InsideList-t.html

Latakia is particularly interesting because the town and province are the heartland of the Alawites, a Shiite sect that produced the ruling Assad family and much of the current governing elite.

The release from Universal Pictures cost $63 million to make, and audience-interest surveys indicated it would open to about $25 million in ticket sales. But a strong, whimsical marketing campaign did the trick, aided by the comedian Russell Brand, who gave voice to the main character, the Easter Bunny’s teenage son, right. Teenage girls, it turns out, find Mr. Brand as hilarious as many adults find him irritating. Summit Entertainment’s “Source Code,” an action thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, was second with about $15 million in ticket sales, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. “Insidious,” an extremely inexpensive horror film from FilmDistrict, was third with about $13.5 million in sales. “Insidious” cost only $1 million to make, according to Jason Blum, a producer of the film. “Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules” (20th Century Fox) was fourth with about $10 million, lifting its two-week total to $38.4 million. “Limitless” (Relativity Media) was fifth, selling roughly $9.4 million in tickets for a three-week total of $55.6 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/movies/hop-is-off-to-a-surprisingly-robust-start.html

Last year his play “Equivocation” took the honors following a run at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

And then as they got to know me and got more comfortable, then I would’ve started toying with the format and trying new things. I think we were overly ambitious.

The owners have donated three roomfuls of the scenery, painted by the muralist Rufus Porter’s nephew Jonathan Poor, along with underlying layers of plaster and lath, fireplace mantels and an entire staircase. The museum is raising $60,000 for the dismantling work, by the salvager David Ottinger, and is renovating an 1830s house that will accommodate the acquisition. Poor died in his early 40s, soon after completing the work for a local physician, perhaps because mural painting was a hazardous profession. “My supposition is that all the materials they worked with were poisonous,” Julie Lindberg, the Porter museum’s curator, said.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/maine-museum-to-get-newly-discovered-1840s-murals/

She has been hinting at a move for ages, and speculation that she wouldn’t last has been gurgling pretty much since her first day in the anchor’s chair five years ago. But rarely was she ever so open with her ambivalence about the job as she was in an interview with Andrew Goldman, which appears in the April 10 issue of the magazine but which we’re publishing online now. Goldman conducted it on Friday, March 25, the day before Couric took off for a pre-big-news vacation to Turks and Caicos. Although she wouldn’t confirm that she was leaving the show — she was more interested in discussing her new book, “The Best Advice I Ever Got: Lessons From Extraordinary Lives” — she expressed some regrets about trying to push the nightly-news genre too far too fast and she floated a theory (though she wouldn’t put her name behind it) that CBS’s local news lead-ins might have kept her mired in third place.

2011-04-04,David Foster Wallace’s Unfinished Novel — and Life,"Every writer dies, probably, still intending to write something. It’s a basic fact of (to put it slightly trivially) scheduling: the time lines of mortality and ambition rarely coincide. Thomas Aquinas finished only the first two sections of his “Summa Theologica” — a work that would loom over philosophical thought for centuries — before (according to some biographers) he hit his head on a branch while riding a donkey and plunged into his final illness. Walter Benjamin worked for 13 years on his magisterial “Arcades Project” but left it unfinished when he committed suicide to avoid falling into the hands of the Nazis. The list could go on almost indefinitely, with works snuffed out by illness (Flaubert’s “Bouvard and Pécuchet”) and genocide (Némirovsky’s “Suite Francaise”) and alcoholic dissipation (Flann O’Brien’s “Slattery’s Sago Saga”). The loss is particularly hard when an author seems to have been really humming along — when the last big thing was a masterpiece and the next one promised to be another. “Dostoyevsky,” the novelist Norman Rush has said, “died still intending to write another volume of ‘The Brothers Karamazov.’ It’s like a knife in my heart that he didn’t.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10Riff-t.html

She has whipped up Eton mess à la française, lemon and lavender roast chicken, tonka bean soufflé, and croque madame muffins. Khoo’s favorite dish so far, pot au feu fajitas (melt-in-your-mouth beef stew and fresh vegetables in a tortilla with sauce from the pot au feu), summarizes the spirit of her book: “It’s not quite French, but it takes on the initial French flavors.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/lean-cuisine-pariss-tiniest-kitchen/

The Hollywood Reporter said that Mr. Hayes will join Will Sasso, of “Mad TV” and “$#*! My Dad Says,” who is set to play the follicularly deficient Curly Howard. The  movie  is not a biographical film and will instead feature a slapstick trio in new comedy sketches based on the original Stooges.  It has already taken a few eye gouges en route to the big screen: at one time, the planned cast included Sean Penn as Larry, Jim Carrey as Curly and Benicio Del Toro as Moe, but that fell apart like a high-society pie dinner after Mr. Penn withdrew from the project.

2011-04-05,Paul Ryan and the Triumph of Policy,"You do not have to like the long-term budget that Paul Ryan and the House Republicans have released this morning. There’s plenty in the plan for liberals to hate, moderates to doubt, and conservatives to question. But you do have to respect it. As my colleague David Brooks writes today, it is “the most comprehensive and most courageous budget reform proposal any of us have seen in our lifetimes.” It puts flesh on the bones of the standard-issue conservative pledge to limit government’s growth, and it does so not with evasive pledges on process (like the risible idea of a balanced budget amendment) or dishonest suggestions that the deficit can be erased by defunding N.P.R. and slashing foreign aid, but by attacking entitlement spending deeply and directly. George W. Bush touched the third rail of American politics with his Social Security gambit, and lived to regret it. With their proposal to transform Medicare from an open-ended entitlement to a system that provides support for seniors’ premiums, Ryan and the Republicans are reaching out and grabbing it with both hands. In the process, they are being brutally honest with the American people, in ways that the Obama White House has repeatedly refused to be, about the scale of the deficit challenge and the scope of the reforms needed to address it.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/paul-ryan-and-the-triumph-of-policy/

(Stops included M.A.C. and Sephora.) She recently discovered Super, Dr. Nicolas Perricone’s new collection, at its flagship in Berkeley, Calif. — the band is based in San Francisco — and swears by the First Blush Brightening Serum: “I’ve been using it over makeup to set it and have a bit of a glow.” Other must-haves include Osis Mattifying Powder (“I sprinkle it in my hair and it looks teased”), Stila Kajal Eye Pencil in black (“looks better the next day”), Frederic Malle Une Rose (“androgynous but romantic — plus the traditional Goth girl scent is rose water”) and Tom Ford Bruised Plum Lip Color (“it’s like neu-Goth, because it’s sheer”). But the singer is always looking to evolve with her look: “I really want to start wearing brown lipstick. I’ve been watching a lot of ‘My So-Called Life’ lately, and they all have that brown lipstick! I think the ’90s are what it’s all about right now.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/stage-beauty-tamaryn/

Although final audience figures for CBS’s live broadcast of the N.C.A.A. men’s championship game were not immediately available on Tuesday, preliminary overnight estimates were down slightly compared with last year, when 23.9 million watched the title matchup on CBS. Despite that modest decline, the game’s ratings were still high enough that CBS might have led the night over all were it not for lower ratings preceding the basketball coverage for sitcom reruns at 8 and 8:30, “The Big Bang Theory” (9.6 million) and “Rules of Engagement” (7.4 million). The repeats lagged in comparison with ABC’s 10 p.m. audience for “Castle” (11.7 million) following “Dancing With the Stars.” NBC ranked third with “Harry’s Law” at 10 (7.4 million) following a rerun of “Chuck” at 8 (2.5 million) and “The Event” at 9 (3.9 million).

2011-04-06,Remembering Don Hill,"When Don Hill, who opened his eponymous downtown club in 1993 (and before that, the Cat Club and Kenny’s Castaways), died last Thursday, social media were buzzing with words of remembrance. Many people knew him as the man at the end of the bar, drinking tequila and Heineken, occasionally playing video games. “We did parties last month for the First Precinct and the Hells Angels,” said Paul Sevigny, who, along with Nur Khan, began working with Hill about seven months ago to bring some new blood to the place. “That’s how universally loved he was.” Loved, yes, but also a mystery even to those who knew him — details about his family and childhood remain fuzzy. “You’d go in there with someone who’d never been and you’d be like, ‘Oh, there’s Don!’ And people would be like, ‘There’s actually a Don Hill?’” said the makeup artist Mike Potter. “People didn’t know he was a real person.” Like many, Potter, a club regular in the ’90s, has Don Hill’s to thank for his career: After John Cameron Mitchell recognized him from the SqueezeBox party, the two became friendly, which led to Potter doing the makeup for “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” Brendan Manning, of the New York City chapter of the Hells Angels, points out that Hill, whose memorial service is tonight at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in NoLIta, had booked — for $200 a week — “a guy named Bruce Springsteen,” back in the Kenny’s Castaways days. The Moment asked a few who knew Hill personally to tell us about him (in more than 140 characters).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/remembering-don-hill/

Democrats have been known to mess that last part up and nominate a dweeb, but Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America.

Ms. Tulloch, who has lived between Australia and New York, went on to write other books, but “Fabulous Nobodies” seemed to strike a chord with people who were in New York (or wanted to be) at that time. More interesting to me is how difficult it has been for a filmmaker to capture the fashion scene. What are the great fashion films?

The shoes — velvet, satin and felt wedges and heels (all vegan, to match the 33-year-old’s lifestyle) in salmon, saffron and cardinal red — attest to what Sizzi learned while working as an accessories designer at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. Clever ’60s proportions and mod collaborations with the milliner Patricia Underwood and the jeweler Thomas Bliven add a bit of nonecclesiastical zing.

For the rest of this melancholic film by the Portuguese director João Pedro Rodrigues that image lingers as a mental double exposure with the visage of the movie’s protagonist, Tonia (Fernando Santos), a fading drag queen in 1980s Lisbon.

Extramusical notions often animate the music as well. “Mirage,” a string quartet, evokes both the desolation and the power of the Israeli desert; “Spices, Perfumes, Toxins!,” a kaleidoscopic percussion concerto, builds on the mingled allure and peril of the substances in its title.

In the nearly 50 years since its publication, her account of those proceedings, “Eichmann in Jerusalem,” has come to overshadow its subject. The book, it is true, commands attention. It is a breathtaking admixture of genres (history, philosophy, journalism) and contains strong, often unconventional, moral judgments (especially her contempt for the Jewish leaders who cooperated with their murderers). It aims to render grand historical conclusions but remains unintentionally and inescapably personal.

Brigge has something of Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man seething within him, and also recalls the sordid unnamed narrator of Henri Barbusse’s novel “Hell”: misfits and spiritual lepers, indeed spat out by fate, these characters are simultaneously too outraged and too sensitive for civilization. They are precursors to perhaps the most notable misfit in 20th-century European fiction, Meursault from Albert Camus’s novella “The Stranger.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/books/review/book-review-the-terrible-privacy-of-maxwell-sim-by-jonathan-coe.html

How sad, how brave, how hard to watch! In the film “Summertime,” Katharine Hepburn played such a woman, on a solo vacation in Venice, winking back tears while maintaining perfect posture and a rigid smile. But what if the lonely tourist weren’t as lonely as she appeared? What if a man was coming to lay claim to that chair, that coffee, that woman; and what if that woman wished he wouldn’t, “doesn’t at all want a coffee” and is “aware now that we’re at an age when we must take care not to be embarrassing.” Might the man’s presence make the woman lonelier than his absence?

2011-04-08,How Evolution Explains Altruism,"What do colon cancer, ant colonies, language and global warming have in common? This might sound like the front end of a joke, but in fact it’s a serious challenge to the standard view of evolution. Martin A. Nowak, the director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, has devoted a brilliant career to showing that Darwin, and particularly his followers, batted only two for three. Random mutation and natural selection have indeed been powerful motors for change in the natural world — the struggle for existence pitting the fit against the fitter in a hullabaloo of rivalry. But most of the great innovations of life on earth, Nowak argues, from genes to cells to societies, have been due to a third motor, and “master architect,” of evolution: cooperation.

For a filmmaker in the reborn Russia the thrill of the new was palpable. Vertov, who saw theory and practice as inseparable, sought to uncover what made the young medium of moving images distinct from the other arts. Every film and every manifesto was an opportunity to examine the latent possibilities and harness the untapped power of cinema.

Since 2001 this Brooklyn band — Tunde Adebimpe, Dave Sitek, Kyp Malone, Jaleel Bunton and Gerard Smith — has made ambitious rock with shades of post-punk, electronica and psychedelic jazz, and lyrics about global politics, love and language. The group made its latest album, “Nine Types of Light” (out Tuesday on Interscope), in Los Angeles, where Mr. Sitek now lives, its first recording outside New York; on Wednesday, the band will make its debut as headliner at Radio City Music Hall. But its members have not given up the indie ethos of the Brooklyn community that nurtured them. The band has already made videos for each song on the album, to be released both individually and edited into a film. “We as a band always have so many ideas for things that aren’t just musical,” Mr. Adebimpe said. “And for less than the price of a Maroon 5 video you can make a full-length feature.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/arts/music/tv-on-the-radio-members-share-tales.html

But it was one of those weekends when a flop was the news: “Arthur,” a $40 million Warner Brothers remake starring Russell Brand, right, was a distant second with about $12.6 million — a terrible result considering the studio’s considerable marketing campaign. Brand burnout may have played a role. Mr. Brand, the comedian, known for his fingernails-on-a-chalkboard voice, has made recent appearances to promote his films — he is also a prominent member of the “Hop” cast (as the voice of E. B., left) — on outlets as varied as “American Idol” and the “Kids’ Choice Awards.” “Hanna,” a Focus Features release about a 16-year-old assassin, was a stronger-than-expected third with $12.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticket statistics. “Soul Surfer” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fourth with about $11 million; this drama, based on the true story of a girl who returns to surfing after losing her arm in a shark attack, received positive scores in exit polls. “Insidious” (FilmDistrict) was fifth with about $9.7 million for a two-week total of about $27 million. Also notable: “Your Highness,” a stoner comedy starring Natalie Portman and James Franco that cost Universal about $50 million, was a bomb, opening in sixth place with $9.5 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/movies/russell-brand-is-up-and-down-at-movie-theaters.html

For graphic design, it’s letterpress, a labor-intensive printing process that creative types are taking up as an antidote to days spent staring at their iMacs. Produced on antique presses and characterized by heavily impressed lettering on thick paper, letterpress cards and stationery — if you’ve received a wedding invitation from an even vaguely arty couple in the past few years, chances are it was letterpress printed — are the graphic design equivalent of slow food. For designers who want to unplug, literally, letterpress is a chance to spend time refining their craft using a method that was considered old-fashioned long before the days of Photoshop. “People miss the hands-on experience of printing,” says Daniel Gardiner Morris, a fourth-generation letterpress printer and the founder of the Arm, the Williamsburg studio where many local printers have learned the basics of handling Industrial Revolution-era machinery. “Even if you don’t know anything about the process, when you pick up something that was printed on a letterpress, you know there’s something different about it.

Scott looks back at the trial and execution of St. Joan as recounted in the silent classic by the Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer in “The Passion of Joan of Arc” (1928). The film is based on the transcripts from the trial and explores it from a political and religious perspective. “There’s something powerful and mysterious about beholding the image of a human face,” Mr. Scott says about the film’s use of close-ups to build a kind of spiritual intensity. The entire first half is a succession of close-ups, which, Mr. Scott says, “create a feeling of intimacy and confinement. And the drama, even the narrative itself, are contained within these faces.” The film is ultimately more concerned with emotion than politics, making it that much more of a human story. “‘The Passion of Joan of Arc’ creates an uncanny, unforgettable, almost unique sense of connection to its main character,” Mr. Scott says. “We may not ultimately understand Joan, but we know her.” Have you seen the film?

That is to say, do they bully others because they don’t know the difference between right and wrong, or simply because they don’t care about other people’s feelings? Gianluca Gini, Tiziana Pozzoli and Marc Hauser studied this question for the Journal Personality and Individual Differences. They studied 719 children between the ages of 9 and 13 and found that those who engaged in bullying had advanced moral competence. They could make sophisticated distinctions between moral and immoral conduct. They scored low on measures of compassion, though. This reinforces a growing body of research that suggests knowing right from wrong is not necessarily connected to behaving rightly or wrongly.

In the journal Sociological Spectrum, she reports that blacks have lower rates of drug use than whites during early adolescence, but this gap gets inverted as they age. That is to say, whites are more likely to age out of drug use—they stop as they get older. Blacks, perhaps because of work, economic and family conditions, age out less, so by middle age they are using drugs more than whites. This would seem to put a dent in the theory that blacks suffer higher rates of drug use because they are more likely to grow up in single parent homes. If that were true, you’d see the effects in early adolescence. The evidence would seem to point to broader social influences.",Opinion,https://brooks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/substance-abuse-in-black-and-white/

He made his first pin, a replica of the men’s restroom icon, when he was 16. “I just wanted to start something, I wanted to stand out.” He sells his designs — bow ties, barrettes and an assortment of brooches like a thought bubble or a football — through his Web site ($55 to $75; go to bytaj.com). “I want to keep them special — that’s why I don’t create too many too fast.” When asked how Diaconu got her hands on that darling panda face, he shrugs with disbelief. “I have no idea,” he says. “But I sure was happy.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/lapel-invader/

2011-04-14,‘Anything Goes’ Extends Into 2012,"Broadway’s revival of “Anything Goes” won’t be going anywhere any time soon. On Wednesday, Roundabout Theater Company announced that its production of that Cole Porter musical, starring Sutton Foster as the evangelizing nightclub singer Reno Sweeney and Joel Grey as the milquetoast gangster Moonface Martin, will extend its run by about six months. The revival, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, is now planned to play at the Stephen Sondheim Theater through January 8; it was originally scheduled to close after July 31. (That’s roughly 184 more performances of cruise-ship based musical farce, so let’s hope everyone packed some additional swim trunks.) Reviewing this production of “Anything Goes” for The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that it “exudes the effervescence of a freshly poured gin fizz,” adding that when Ms. Foster “turns her toothy, triumphant smile on the audience there’s no doubt that she’s made many converts.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/anything-goes-extends-into-2012/

Worth’s article, reads “el-Qaddafi walad al-Yahudiya,” or “Qaddafi, born Jewish.” In other words, Qaddafi the non-Muslim, the unclean.

2011-04-15,"Two Points of View, Miles Apart","IT might be simplistic or a little silly to say that Robert Whitman — the performance pioneer who is probably the least known member of the vanguard that gave birth to the American experimental theater scene in the 1960s — basically foretold the creation of the Internet in his work. But when you consider the evidence, it’s hard not to believe he created it himself. Decades before YouTube and years before the video camera became a common artist’s tool, Mr. Whitman, a kind of junkman of fleeting imagery, extolled the virtues of television “as a great way to collect stuff; besides what’s on the air, a camera on anything brings it in live.” In 1972, in “News,” the first of his telephone pieces, he enlisted people around the city to use pay phones to call in descriptions of what they were doing or seeing at that moment, which the radio station WBAI broadcast live, a kind of aural Twitter stream. In one of his earliest theater pieces, “American Moon,” in 1960, he split the audience apart in separate tunnels to give each person a slightly different sense of the action. In doing so, he fulfilled what the curator Lynne Cook once described as his distinctive desire to work “collectively to construct an experience intended for the solitary individual,” a phrase that could just as well describe a lot of the social and cultural architecture of the Web.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/robert-whitmans-passport-in-two-states-at-once.html

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., will make it to Broadway this fall, but with only one of the two high-profile actors who were expected to appear in it. Producers for the play said on Thursday that Samuel L. Jackson, the Academy Award-nominated star of “Pulp Fiction,” will portray Dr. King in the production, which will be presented at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, with previews beginning Sept. 22 and opening Oct. 13; Kenny Leon, a Tony Award nominee for last year’s revival of “Fences,” will direct. Halle Berry, who was supposed to play Camae, a hotel maid at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in Ms. Hall’s imagined account of the night before Dr. King’s assassination, will not be participating in the production as had been anticipated. In a statement, producers said “Ms. Berry would not be appearing in the role due to child custody issues,” and that an actor for the role “will be announced shortly.” “The Mountaintop,” which made its debut in London in 2009, won Ms. Hall the Olivier Award for best new play last year. The play is produced by Jean Doumanian Productions, Sonia Friedman Productions, Ambassador Theater Group, Jerry Frankel, Ted Snowdon, Bob Bartner and Tom Wirtshafter.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/the-mountaintop-will-come-to-broadway-with-jackson-but-without-berry/

Just as Mailer and Truman Capote once advertised the literary intentions of their journalism with the term “nonfiction novel,” Mailer now honored a television show by suggesting that it wasn’t a television show at all, but something else, something literary. The irony was that Mailer had it backward. “The Sopranos” represented the end of whatever remained of television’s status anxiety; it didn’t need to be anything but itself to be taken seriously.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-use-and-abuse-of-literature-by-marjorie-garber.html

2011-04-15,Shakespeare Subpoenaed,"Kenji Yoshino is a respected legal scholar (the Chief Justice Earl Warren professor of constitutional law at New York University) who regularly teaches a course on literature and the law. The device he has come up with in “A Thousand Times More Fair” is to match a play of Shakespeare with some modern event or issue. One can see how this might stimulate class discussion, and it seems to succeed, since he tells us that his course on constitutional law is oversubscribed by two to one, but the class on literature and law has more applicants by six to one. The process apparently works. But what of the product? Considered apart from the give-and-take of the classroom, one of three things can be the result. First, the stereo­scopic approach can deepen one’s understanding of both a play and the event matched with it. Second, at least one of the pair can be given new understanding. Third, meaning can be drained, not deepened, on both sides of the matchup.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-a-thousand-times-more-fair-by-kenji-yoshino.html
2011-04-15,Geoff Dyer’s Wide-Ranging Curiosity,"Assembling a collection of reviews and essays is a test of the richness of a critic’s inner life, an echo-sounding exercise that measures the depth of available talent. While a single piece may be impressive in isolation — rehearsed in a glossy magazine or nestled in the review pages — the book-length selection takes us out of the safety of those shallows and asks whether a writer’s reflections still rise beyond the threshold of banality when repeated over several hundred pages. If a critic’s sense of artistic achievement is sclerotically narrow, or based on a single approach applied to every work under consideration, the collection will coolly sketch a relief map of those failings.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-otherwise-known-as-the-human-condition-by-geoff-dyer.html

And we were both wordsmiths, cuddle-mad, and extremely playful. . . . All couples play kissy games they don’t want other people to know about, and all regress to infants from time to time, since, though we marry as adults, we don’t marry adults. We marry children who have grown up and still rejoice in being children, especially if we’re creative. Imaginative people fidget with ideas, including the idea of a relationship.

A diamond isn’t like fur, which can’t do much to hide its origins. But there is a lurking suspicion that, like the gold of the Nibelungs, no good can come from this bright rock.

In her new film, “Hanna,” she tries the role of ruthless C.I.A. agent on for size.

Just 3.3 million viewers tuned in to the premiere of “The Paul Reiser Show” at 8:30 p.m., according to Nielsen’s estimates. The new series faces considerable odds, coming after NBC’s similarly ratings-starved sitcom “Community” (3.5 million), at 8 p.m., and occupying a time slot otherwise dominated by “American Idol” on Fox. For the night, NBC ranked a distant third, garnering its best ratings at 9 p.m. for “The Office” (7.7 million), which featured a guest appearance from Will Ferrell. Fox led the night with 21 million viewers tuning for an elimination episode of “Idol” and 11.9 million at 9 p.m. for “Bones.” CBS placed second, despite broadcasting a line-up of all repeats. ABC was fourth, finishing close behind NBC with reruns from 9 to 11 p.m. following a new episode of “Wipeout” at 8 (6.2 million).",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/viewers-not-so-mad-about-paul-reisers-return/

2011-04-18,"Sentence of the Week, Insomnia Edition","This was one of those magical weeks of bedtime reading, when the house got perfectly quiet and my books got very loud and I ended up staying up until 2 in the morning just about every night. I was reading: a big, heavy, three-volume hardcover edition of Samuel Johnson’s “Lives of the Poets”; a newfangled iPhone essay (with pictures, audio, etc.) about ants called “Before the Swarm”; “Father and Son,” Edmund Gosse’s 1907 memoir about growing up with evangelical Christian parents (this was also on my iPhone, via the less high-tech Project Gutenberg); and an advance copy of Nicholson Baker’s erotic fantasy novel “House of Holes: A Book of Raunch.” (This won’t be published until August, but — hoo-boy, people, get ready for this book. It is going to be Talked About. There will be fistfights in the hallways of your local public library. I keep describing it to people as “porny Alice in Wonderland” — an impossible combination of crazy, cheerful imagination and industrial-grade filth. It made me hoot out loud every other page or so, and on a few occasions my mouth actually, literally dropped open.

In an environment that becomes more competitive year after year, we asked a sampling of colleges and universities for a sense of how things were stacking up. Over all, admittance rates continued to decline. For example, the Ivy League on average admitted 10 percent of applicants, down from the 11 percent recorded last year. The results shouldn’t surprise. Some 2.2 million online applications have been filed for the fall using the Common Application alone, up almost 22 percent from 2010. The glut of applications means admissions offices must deny an increasing proportion of students. But take heart: when the dust settled on last fall’s freshmen class, the average acceptance rate was 67 percent.       ",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/education/edlife/edl-17data.html

The median income figure the C.B.O. used (see Table 4-4 on p. 65 of the report) is $94,900 for a family of four, which (as a number of readers have noted) seems much higher than the usual estimates for median income in a four-person household. It turns out that I didn’t catch a crucial footnote in the C.B.O. document: “All income is assumed to be from compensation, which includes employment-based health insurance and the employer’s share of payroll taxes.” That is to say, the $94,900 in income includes the estimated value of the median family’s health care plan as well as their salary, which is not what most people think of when they hear the term “median income.” I apologize for the confusion.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/a-note-on-median-income/

Jeff Bridges, the “Big Lebowski” star who played a country singer so well in “Crazy Heart” he won an Academy Award for it, will record a solo album for the Blue Note Records division of EMI, the label said on Tuesday. The album, which does not yet have a title (can we humbly suggest “Careful, Man, There’s A Beverage Here”?) will be recorded with the producer T-Bone Burnett, who first met Mr. Bridges on the set of “Heaven’s Gate,” and selected music for the “Big Lebowski” soundtrack and co-wrote songs for “Crazy Heart,” including the Oscar-nominated track “The Weary Kind.” Blue Note Records said in a statement that Mr. Bridges “will contribute several of his own compositions” and perform songs by Stephen Bruton and John Goodwin, Greg Brown, Bo Ramsey, Tom Waits, and others. Though we wouldn’t hold out much hope for the Dude’s Creedence cassettes, Mr. Bridges’s album is planned for a late summer release.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/the-dude-records-jeff-bridges-plans-solo-album/

Soviet-style economic policies have depleted Belarus’s foreign currency reserves, and people have been waiting in long lines to exchange rubles for increasingly scarce dollars and euros.

That first glimpse was surprising — the stout, pale-skinned woman in sturdy sandals, standing squarely a half-step ahead of the lithe, darker-skinned figure to her left. His elas­tic-band body bespoke discipline, even asceticism. Her form was well padded, territory ceded long ago to the pleasures of appetite and the forces of anatomical destiny. He had the studied casualness of a catalog model, in khakis, at home in the viewfinder. She met the camera head-on, dressed in hand-loomed textile dyed indigo, a silver earring half-hidden in the cascading curtain of her dark hair. She carried her chin a few degrees higher than most. His right hand rested on her shoulder, lightly. The photograph, taken on a Manhattan rooftop in August 1987 and e-mailed to me 20 years later, was a revelation and a puzzle. The man was Barack Obama at 26, the community organizer from Chicago on a visit to New York. The woman was Stanley Ann Dunham, his mother.

2011-04-21,China: Documentary Film Festival Is Canceled," A prominent independent documentary film festival in China, scheduled this year for May, has been canceled because of the tense atmosphere created by the continuing government crackdown on freedom of speech. The English edition of Global Times, a populist newspaper, published an article on Wednesday about the cancellation in which it quoted Zhu Rikun, the festival’s art director, saying the organizers had decided to cancel it themselves. “The overall situation was tense, and we had received a lot of pressure,” Mr. Zhu said. “We worried that the films to be shown would meet some problems in this environment and decided to cancel it.” Another festival organizer, Li Shanshan, told Global Times that about 20 overseas guests, 10 directors and around 40 fans had registered to attend the festival. The cancellation of the festival, which is usually held every year in Songzhuang, on the outskirts of Beijing, was first announced Monday on the festival’s microblog on sina.com.

His arrest has worsened relations in the power-sharing government that includes the M.D.C. parties and President Robert Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party. Since the M.D.C., the party founded to fight Mr. Mugabe’s rule, accepted the power-sharing arrangement in 2008, about 30 of its 109 members of Parliament have been arrested at one point or another, according to human rights lawyers and the M.D.C.

Visitors enter the exhibition in a space surrounded by video images from Lindbergh’s recent cinematic series, “Invasion,” a film that depicts a crowd in slow motion moving into a cloud of smoke.

2011-04-21,Space Invaders,"“Home Show, Revisited,” opening this month at the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum in California, puts a new spin on the expression “mi casa, su casa.” Now in its third iteration, the site-specific exhibition pairs 10 Los Angeles artists with 9 area residences, inviting the artists to explore the notion of home. Some of the work, like the circular swimming pool that Piero Golia built in the yard of an updated Spanish-style gem or Jennifer West’s experimental surf films, which will screen at sundown at a Carpinteria surf shack, makes direct references to life in Southern California. Other installations play with personal space: the sculptor Ry Rocklen’s tiled floor piece speaks to the work of the mosaic artist who is hosting him, and Bettina Hubby (above) has created curtains — depicting her “living” inside a Montecito Tudor — that will hang outside the windows, “providing privacy for the owners but exposing me,” she says.

2011-04-21,What Gary Taubes Eats,"Gary Taubes, the author of last week’s cover story (“Is Sugar Toxic?”) as well as an anti-carb cover story from 2002 (“What If It’s All Been a Big Fat Lie?”) and the book “Why We Get Fat,” has plenty of critics. But no one could accuse him of failing to practice what he preaches. His is a steak-and-egg-heavy diet, without the pasta and potatoes. If you fear for his arteries, you can check out an analysis of his blood lipids posted on his blog. When I talked to Gary this morning, he was in Los Angeles, visiting family for spring break, and (in addition to answering hundreds of sugar-related e-mails) was preparing breakfast: scrambled eggs and bacon for his wife; scrambled eggs, bacon, Italian sausage and black coffee for himself; Cheerios, raisins and Italian sausage for the kids. He did cop to this rare, vacation-related indulgence: last night he ate a chocolate macaroon. It’s Passover, after all. He reports that it was delicious.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/what-gary-taubes-eats/

As the founder of the graphics firm and indie publishing imprint An Art Service, Dugan has become a go-to designer for galleries like Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth, or for virtually anyone in Dan Colen’s crowd. Now he’s slowly making his presence known with Karma (21 Downing Street; open Thursday-Sunday from noon to 7 p.m. or by appointment), a tiny shop in the front of his office where he sells his own catalog of gritty pop-minimalist art books and posters alongside books and objects that inspire him. Dugan started the publishing arm of his business in 2009 as an additional platform for the artists whose Web sites, books and ephemera he was already designing. “Allan Kaprow, Ed Ruscha and a lot of the Fluxus artists were designing all these amazing objects to help support their projects,” he says. “I guess I think of us as trying to help continue that lineage.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/high-browse/

Right now, there are more than 30 skyscrapers under construction — among them the Trump Ocean Club and The Panamera, which will be Latin America’s first Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (both are set to open later this year).

Hardly anyone knew him; he had been Donatella Versace’s assistant for many years. But Mr. Zanini brought a clean vitality to Halston, especially to the day clothes. That show remains a favorite of mine, and it was his only Halston collection because he and the owners parted ways within a few months. Then he got the gig at Rochas, and he’s taken a completely different approach with the sporty French label.

2011-04-22,Pink and Blue,"If you are buying clothes for a newborn, what color do you buy? The general rule these days is that girls are more likely to wear pink and boys are more likely to wear blue. But that wasn’t always the case. In 1918, an article in Ladies Home Journal advised: “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.”",Opinion,https://brooks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/pink-and-blue/

The duo behind the label United Bamboo recently set out to create an eco-friendly line that would give green technology a bit of boudoir appeal. “There are many companies putting out clothes labeled as organic, but the fabrics might have been dyed or finished with harsh chemicals,” Pham says. Bamboo By, a new collection of camisoles, dresses and smocks inspired by Victorian undergarments, definitely delivers on the sexy front. But as far as organic goes, there is still work to be done. “It’s a long process and will most likely never be 100 percent eco-friendly,” Pham adds, “but we encourage our vendors to offer more organic pieces to supplement the nonorganic collections they carry.” With current eco lines focusing on ethics as well as design, we look forward to Bamboo’s commitment to both moral and aesthetic standards.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/naughty-by-nature-2/

Peter Matthiessen attended the wedding. James Baldwin stayed with the family in Roxbury, Conn., while writing “Another Country.” Alexandra — called “Albert” by her father — remembers Frank Sinatra “lathering up” in the outdoor shower at their summer retreat on Martha’s Vineyard. When James and Gloria Jones, “drinkers and swearers,” came to visit, Gloria wouldn’t let her husband pass the room where little Albert was watching television without snapping, “Give her a twenty!” Edward Kennedy risked his dignity on Vineyard dance floors.

The work he is showing nearly 50 years later at the William Griffin Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., straddles both genres — illuminated light bulbs protrude from the canvases, and abstract figures dance across them. The installation includes eerie watercolors and a number of lamplike sculptures. Lynch’s proclivity for “shape and light” drew him to another project, Silencio, a nightclub set to open this summer at 142 rue Montmartre in Paris, for which he designed the interiors and the furniture. “I enjoy how architecture and design create mood,” he says. The club was named for the spooky theater in “Mulholland Drive,” so no telling what that mood will be.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/master-mind/

In a statement released by the company on Friday, Mr. Stiefel, 38, said he had decided to withdraw so that he could focus on his duties as dean of dance at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. This is Mr. Stiefel’s final year as dean. He is to take on the role of artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet in September. “Leading the U.N.C.S.A. School of Dance through a critical period of transition has required the type of energy and attention that has kept me from properly focusing and physically preparing for my upcoming performances,” Mr. Stiefel said in the statement. “I am truly disappointed not to be performing with my colleagues at ABT and for the New York audiences.” This season he was scheduled to dance opposite Alina Cojocaru in “Giselle” in May and Natalia Osipova in “Coppelia” in June. Mr. Stiefel, who joined Ballet Theater in 1997, has also withdrawn from American Ballet Theater’s tour of Japan in July.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/ethan-stiefel-to-withdraw-from-american-ballet-theaters-spring-season/

And the finished text shows none of the PowerPoint insipidness we associate with committee-speak or with later group translations like the 1961 New English Bible, which T.S. Eliot said did not even rise to “dignified mediocrity.” Far from bland, the King James Bible is one of the great masterpieces of English prose.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/weekinreview/24mcgrath.html

Amale Andraos and Dan Wood of Work Architecture Company will focus on Portland, Ore.; Michael Bell of Columbia University on Temple Terrace, Fla.; Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang on Cicero, Ill.; Hilary Sample and Michael Meredith of MOS on the Oranges in New Jersey; and Andrew Zago of Zago Architecture on Rialto, Calif. The program, “Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream,” was organized by Barry Bergdoll, MoMA’s chief curator of architecture, and Reinhold Martin, director of Columbia University’s Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture. A four-month workshop phase is to begin May 7 with a public symposium at MoMA P.S. 1, where the public can view the work in progress on June 18 and Sept. 17.

Eliot; the two issues of  Wyndham Lewis’s vorticist zine Blast;  the more visual Rhythm, which published several designs for the Ballets Russes, among them “L’après-midi d’un faune”; as well as such well-known journals as Scribner’s Magazine.

2011-04-25,For the Record,"Indie record shops generally look like Championship Vinyl, the music-geek hangout owned by John Cusack in “High Fidelity,” which is to say the closest they get to décor is the album covers on the wall. “Everyone asks why we don’t have records on the wall,” says Ian Marshall, the co-owner, along with his wife, Jade Gordon, of L.A.’s Wombleton Records. “It’s like it’s some sort of requirement. But when we opened the store we knew we’d be spending a lot of time here and that’s not really the kind of environment we wanted to be in.” Instead, the couple has created a used-record shop that resembles a Victorian parlor, right down to the embossed wallpaper and potted plants. Marshall, a self-described Anglophile who grew up outside of Toronto but spent his school holidays visiting family in Britain, wanted the Highland Park store to have an English feel, a conceit that extends to its name, a play on the popular British children’s books (and later a BBC series) about the Wombles. To get Wombleton’s 19th-century ambience just right, the couple spent hours trawling eBay for vintage furniture and prevailed upon friends like David Donohue, a graphic designer and surf board builder who made the harpsichord-shaped record bins, and Nic Taylor and Jennifer Brandt-Taylor of Thunderwing Press, who created the store’s logo, a stagecoach on LP wheels. “Which is very apt,” Marshall says. “We spend a lot of time in foreign countries, driving around in rental cars looking for records.” But perhaps the most refreshing quality about Wombleton is its lack of snobbery. Unlike Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Todd Louima), “the musical moron twins” who staffed Championship Vinyl, Marshall and Gordon, who stock an eclectic mix of British pop from the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, won’t deride your taste. “I’m a bottom feeder,” Marshall says, laughing. “I like crap.

(See Gramm, Phil and Connally, John, among others.)

2011-04-27,Light Fantastic | Olafur Eliasson in Iceland,"On May 4 the Icelandic capital will celebrate the opening of the Harpa-Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Center, a stunning monolith whose shimmering glass facade was designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson. The building will be the new home of the Icelandic Opera and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (which previously had to make do with performing in movie theaters), and for the opening celebration there will be concerts by local bands like Mammút and Agent Fresco as well as screenings of nature movies and documentaries. Many Icelanders hope the building, conceived of as a new cultural hot spot for the city, will also be a tourist draw during the long, dark winters — a fact of life that was central to the design. “In Iceland, 30 percent of the day is twilight. One third of people’s lives are lived in this transitional zone,” says Eliasson, whose facade reflects the low northern light in bewitching variation, as though it is lit from within. “The relationship people in Iceland have to the landscape is like the relationship you have to a close family member. It has to do with the way the light gives the landscape a constantly changing personality. It speaks to you with such finesse.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/light-fantastic-olafur-eliasson-in-iceland/

But the proposals that eventually became the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare at least took the the system’s pathologies seriously, drew on some of the smartest liberal health care wonkery, and tried to grapple with the scale of the problems they were confronting. The Republicans, on the other hand, never coalesced around a substantial alternative, declined to embrace the best proposals from conservative policy thinkers, and generally made a purely negative (and sometimes cynical) case against the Democratic bill, rather than setting out a convincing and rigorous alternative.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/the-white-house-the-democrats-and-the-deficit/

2011-04-28,In Praise of Monarchy,"I appreciate the small-r republican ardor with which Mark Oppenheimer assails America’s royal wedding obsessives, but he’s fighting a losing battle. “Americans are supposed to loathe and reject monarchs,” he writes, but it’s telling that all his examples of that loathing (“In the earliest years of English settlement, this land was a proud haven for king killers … [we] fought a bloody war for the privilege to ignore the king of England … Anti-monarchism was then written into our Constitution …”) are centuries old, dating from a time when republicanism was an exciting cause rather than a somewhat-ossified assumption. Since those days, we’ve regressed to the (very human) mean: We’re fascinated by the royal family that we once overthrew, we have our own hereditary dynasties (and the slobbering coverage to match), and we’ve gradually turned our presidency into a quasi-imperial office, complete with coronations and cultic devotions and all the rest. True, by the standards of modern history, with its parade of strongmen and caudillos and presidents-for-life, our republican institutions have been impressively resilient. But even the American experience suggests that the anti-monarchical temper Oppenheimer invokes is ultimately artificial and unnatural, a triumph of theory over instinct and idealism over human nature. In their hearts, most people want a king and queen. ",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/in-praise-of-monarchy/

2011-04-29,Magic Lanterns,"The young designer Marco Dessí, who was born in Italy and who is based in Vienna, has a knack for clarity. A recent case in point is his Basket chandelier for the venerable Viennese manufacturer Lobmeyr. Dessí took as its starting point the glass-tube arms of an 18th-century chandelier but employed them in a new way, bending them into hexagons, stacking them in a shape inspired by mosque lanterns and the glass-tube windows of Frank Lloyd Wright’s S. C. Johnson Administration Building, and weaving them together with jewel-toned silk cords. The result is an alluring combination of the industrial and the glamorous.

Organizers of the Suzhou music festival, called Strawberry, said in messages on the Internet this week that the event was canceled for reasons related to recent rainstorms. But artists and observers of the music industry in China have speculated that Strawberry was canceled because of official pressure after a political incident at a music festival last weekend in Jiangsu Province. At that festival, called Zhouzhuang, the name of the detained artist Ai Weiwei was flashed on a big screen. Days later, Zuoxiao Zuzhou, a Chinese rock musician who expressed support for Mr. Ai at that festival and in a newspaper article, was temporarily detained by police officers. Another music festival, Midi, is scheduled to take place this weekend in a suburb of Beijing; its organizers have privately told people that they are anxious.

Or think of the reader who first encountered the opening of “The Sound and the Fury”: “Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting.” By the end of Faulkner’s first page, that reader surely wondered if there had been some problem at the printing press. Could the pages have been scrambled?

Such a nation-bound approach to the writing of American history implies that the lives of those who left were not significant. Yet they were, and Maya Jasanoff, who teaches history at Harvard, has provided a richly informative account of those who made the choice to embrace imperial Britain. As earlier historians of the Revolution have pointed out, the loyalists tended to have strong connections to the imperial administration, belong to the Anglican Church and possess close business or family ties to Britain.

Her husband, a neuroscientist named Boris Izcovich, has asked for a “pause” in their marriage so he can take up with a younger colleague, “a woman with whom he had no past.” After a short, agonizing stay in a psychiatric ward, Mia decamps from her Brooklyn apartment to tiny Bonden, seeing no choice but to wait out the “cruel crack of hope” in her husband’s request. There she finds herself immersed, somewhat accidentally, in an all-female world that includes her mother’s five lively geriatric friends, the seven adolescent members of a poetry workshop and the young mother next door, whose husband travels often for work. Over the course of the summer, Mia confronts, with the help of phone sessions with her (female) therapist, her own history as a willing second-class citizen, “a scribbler of the stolen interval” who “hadn’t fought for myself.” Along the way, she re-examines everything she’s believed about the differences between men and women and the possibility of married love.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/books/review/book-review-the-summer-without-men-by-siri-hustvedt.html

In the 1950s and ’60s, even with the Gold Rush a century past, California still had its sand and its sun and its surf to beckon the hopeful westward, and of course it had the movies too, on screens as big — and sometimes as loud — as giant waves. After the gloom and horror of the Second World War and in the midst of the cold war’s nagging anxieties, all those bright blue skies and that warm Pacific water and that clean, soft, shimmery sand looked mighty inviting. “Catch a wave,” the Beach Boys sang, “and you’re be sittin’ on top of the world.” They sounded as if they meant it.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/movies/california-and-the-end-of-beach-movies.html

2011-04-29,What Was Condoleezza Rice Playing on ’30 Rock’?,"Of the many bizarre plot lines running through last night’s episode of “30 Rock,” Condoleezza Rice’s sly cameo as the ex-girlfriend of Alec Baldwin’s character, Jack Donaghy, was by far the highlight. In the scene, shown above, Ms. Rice, a former secretary of state and classically trained pianist, challenged Mr. Baldwin, a Lincoln Center regular himself, to a musical face-off. (Mr. Baldwin does not actually perform in the episode.) We asked Anthony Tommasini, the chief classical music critic of The Times, who interviewed Ms. Rice about her chamber music experience in a profile in 2005, to identify the pieces. “They are all by Mozart,” he said. “The first is the opening of the third movement, the Rondo, from the Piano Quartet in G minor. The second is the opening of the first movement, the Allegro, of that same Piano Quartet in G minor. The third, and this gets complicated, is the slow movement, the Romanze, of the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, not the opening of the movement, but the beginning of the fast middle section of that movement. Whew.” For insiders, Mr. Tommasini said, “the joke is the snippets of pieces played are not at all pieces for flute.” He added, “He tried to match her playing this music on the solo flute, an unfair match.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/what-was-condoleezza-rice-playing-on-30-rock/

Fox was planning on Sunday to show new installments of those series with an interconnected story line about a hurricane on the Eastern Seaboard. These episodes were planned several months ago, before the recent storms that have killed nearly 300 people in the South. But on Friday, Fox said in a brief statement, “In light of the recent storms that have affected the nation, Fox has decided to postpone the crossover episodes of ‘Family Guy,’ ‘American Dad’ and ‘The Cleveland Show’ that were originally scheduled to air this Sunday.” A spokeswoman for the network said these episodes will instead be shown next season.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/fox-postpones-animated-comedies-with-hurricane-story-line/

The curators, Josée Lepage and Aric Chen (who has written for The Times), and the gallery have created a pop-up tattoo parlor, engaging one of the city’s best tattoo artists, Sarah Bolen from AKA Berlin, and offering designs from a diverse group of artists and designers, including heavyweights like Lawrence Weiner and Wim Delvoye, as well as fashion favorites like the architect Peter Marino and the German conceptual pranksters Bless. One of the most compelling designs comes courtesy of Olaf Nicolai, who suggests that collectors mark the initials of someone they love or hate using his codified variation on the alphabet. In designing his alphabet, Nicolai says that he “found [a] minimalistic style more interesting,” which didn’t function “like a billboard.” (In other words, you’re out of luck if you’re looking for hearts pierced by daggers or busty mermaids.) His design emphasizes “not just information, but also communication.
