2023-10-05,‘Fair Play’ Review: Risky Bonds,"“Fair Play” is a superbly malevolent erotic thriller about two ambitious financial analysts who drink too much, sleep too little and cannot afford to bring their feelings to work. The trouble is that Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) are secretly engaged — a tension aggravated when their boss, Campbell (an intimidating Eddie Marsan), promotes her over him. “I’m so happy for you,” Luke manages to croak. Emily believes him (briefly) but Chloe Domont, the writer and director of this impeccable debut feature, suspects this couple might not survive her cutting observations on money, gender and power. Domont doesn’t destroy their bliss with a sledgehammer; she uses a shiv. The agony that follows is a star-making performance for Dynevor and a star-correcting one for Ehrenreich who, in playing a nepotism hire confounded by his first brush with failure, reminds audiences why we’ve been rooting for the actor to succeed.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/movies/fair-play-review.html

The film, scripted by Friedkin himself, is the latest adaptation of a stage warhorse: Herman Wouk’s play “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,” the author’s dramatization of the trial portion of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Caine Mutiny.” (The 1954 film version, featuring an unmatchable Humphrey Bogart as the unstable Lt.

Farrier directed and co-stars in an account of those events that can rightly be called a documentary horror film.

2023-10-05,‘Foe’ Review: The Space Between,"Set in a future when devastation of the environment has humanity turning to outer space as a homestead, “Foe” presents a spectacle of futility.

The somewhat gimmicky genre combination may have had the potential to be a winning combo, but “Totally Killer,” directed by Nahnatchka Khan, struggles to muster up enough charisma to stick the landing.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/movies/totally-killer-review.html

2023-10-05,A Mordant Glimpse at the Austrian Aristocracy,"The name Hemlock Neversink might conjure a wooded fairyland, and that idea isn’t too far from the truth. The 34-room all-inclusive hotel, opening Oct. 13, is set on 230 tree-filled acres in New York’s Catskills region. Activities include guided bird-watching and pine-needle weaving, but the core purpose of the property is to serve as a wellness retreat. Guests will be offered a survey with questions such as “How structured do you like your days?” and “Would you like to move or rest?” The answers are meant to inform a daily itinerary created by the Hemlock team, which might include animal therapy with an on-site herd of goats or a morning cardio dance class. At the spa, nature-inspired treatments such as the Neversink Ice and Stone Ritual, which involves an herb-infused cold water bath, a hot steam shower and a hot river-stone massage, are available for an added charge. The property’s design draws from the region’s Quaker heritage, with a neutral color palette, ash and walnut furniture and quilt-inspired custom wool rugs by Manhattan’s Crosby Street Studios. The husband-and-wife owners, Sims and Kirsten Foster, who were recently nominated for a James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurateur for their other Catskills hotels (including the DeBruce and Kenoza Hall), conceived of another inviting dining space for Hemlock Neversink: Bittersweet, which has two fireplaces, will focus on seasonal and locally sourced dishes.

Even white pigment, which has frequently appeared in Martinez’s pieces since his 2018 “White Out” series, has a charged presence, boldly countering a base painting or washed thinly across the canvas so that the ghost of an underlying color peeks through. His teeming works seem, on the one hand, to be urgently composed, but the carefully accrued coats of paint — sprayed, silk-screened or directly applied from pigment sticks — also point to an artist who knows how to surrender to the pace set by his materials. “I need the paint to dry to produce the layers,” Martinez tells me one overcast afternoon in his studio in Ridgewood, Queens, ahead of his solo show at London’s Timothy Taylor gallery, opening October 12. The walls are hung with pieces in varying stages of completion. He pauses in front of one and leaves a single, deliberate stroke of brown. “I have to override my impatience for the sake of letting it become the painting it needs to become,” he says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/t-magazine/eddie-martinez.html

2023-10-10,Looking to the Dutch Masters for Answers to Life’s Big Questions,"When he moved from New York to the Netherlands in 2002, Benjamin Moser was at the beginning of both his career and a love affair — a triply tenuous situation. He found comfort in the country’s museums, in particular the artists of the 17th-century Dutch Golden Age, an era characterized by social mobility, scientific innovation and economic expansion (as well as rampant colonialism). In “The Upside-Down World,” Moser covers some 18 of the period’s painters, both the famous (Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals) and the lesser known (Adriaen Coorte, Hendrick Avercamp, Rachel Ruysch). He describes the book as the record of an education, learning about and from artists who guided him through “an uncertain life in a new land.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/books/review/the-upside-down-world-benjamin-moser.html

2023-10-10,Noma Co-Founder Opens a Restaurant in Brooklyn,"Some new restaurants are opportunistic, the result of circumstance. Others, like the Danish chef Mads Refslund’s new Brooklyn project, are years in the planning — eight years exactly, said Mr. Refslund, a founder of Noma in Copenhagen. What he set out to achieve is a fluid fine-dining concept, where the cooks are the servers. “Everyone is a cook,” he said. “They can best explain the food to the customers, but turning cooks into waiters is a challenge.” There are 26 of them, all dressed in black and rotating their stations. They’re in full view at work: The dining room amounts to a huge square kitchen, surrounded by 58 counter and table seats, and a bar and a lounge in an industrial space — previously a rubber factory — with a white brick 1930s facade. The restaurant’s menu lists ingredients, each of which can be ordered, in consultation with a cook/waiter, hot or cold, grilled or chilled, or, as the name has it, fire (ild in Danish) and ice (is). The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison. Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal (priced per item) patrol the dining area. The menu is à la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ($150); some are served family-style. The 18-seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement. Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman, his chef de cuisine (who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar, his previous gig, is any indication), are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber, venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes, tuna lightly roasted on kombu, grilled wild duck with plum juice, grilled sea scallop dumplings, surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink, and smoked barbecued eel. On Sundays, meals are served family style, starting at noon, no reservations. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

The room was dark, cold and mostly empty, except for one professor and an unexpected visitor: John Updike. Richardson never spoke to him and she still doesn’t know why he was there. But, in a phone interview, she recalled the chance encounter — “one of those things a student is popeyed over” — with fondness and reverence.

It comprises 251 seats — a mere hamlet in the vast 64,000-seat general kingdom of the place, but it was our hamlet, and on the last Saturday in July, we took up each one of those seats and watched, our collective breath held, as Taylor Swift emerged from a bevy of billowing pastel parachutes and rose up on a platform to perform the 47th show of her Eras Tour. A few songs in, she announced, laughing, that her father told her that Santa Clara had named her its honorary mayor during her two-night stay there and that the entire town had been renamed Swiftie Clara. On the way in, we saw the Police Department cheerfully exchanging friendship bracelets with legions of Swifties. The microcosm of Section 301 offered this same sense of sorority. What a nice neighborhood we had moved into, my 15-year-old son, Ezra, and I. Within minutes of sitting down, we were already a community with a shared, ardent sense of purpose.

2023-10-12,"In Paris, a Mexico City Gallery Installs a Fantasy Sitting Room","As Morocco continues its recovery from last month’s earthquake (which devastated many of the rural communities in the High Atlas Mountains), life in Marrakesh carries on largely uninterrupted, especially in the city’s economically vital tourism sector. That includes the opening of a clutch of new hotels, like Farasha Farmhouse, a four-room boutique property. Formerly an artist’s private retreat, Farasha, which lies 30 minutes outside of the city center, is the vision of Rosena and Fred Charmoy. The Marrakesh-based couple are the founders of Boutique Souk — a local high-end events company popular with visiting celebrities and fashion brands (their client list includes Chanel and Saint Laurent) — and are known for their theatrical, over-the-top parties and weddings. Farasha, though, is a more tranquil endeavor. “We loved the mountain views on both sides of the property,” says Rosena, referring to the Atlas and Jbilet ranges that appear to envelop the acres of olive groves and herb gardens. The two-story main building, which holds three suites and the soaring, open-plan common space, is complemented by a neighboring stand-alone cottage. To furnish the place, the Charmoys turned to local creative friends: floors are laid with custom tapestries from Beni Rugs; sculptures were installed by the Moroccan contemporary artist Amine El Gotaibi; and the book collection comes from the family estate of Diana Vreeland, the legendary former editor of Vogue, donated to the hotel by her son Freck, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Morocco. Food here is similarly considered, overseen by the chef Aniss Meski. The olive oil is made on-site, most vegetable dishes use the farm’s produce and a flock of chickens provides a daily supply of fresh eggs. And if the prospect of snagging one of only four guest rooms seems like a tall challenge, fear not: six more will be available to book starting next year.

His poetry often reflects the immediacy and wit demanded of its modes of distribution. In “fluid cupid,” the mixed-up nature of life itself is the unforeseeable consequence of the mating of a good and bad time. This is the zeitgeist as eavesdropped upon, then shaped up, given sonic punch, made resonant with the quirky agonies of the soul.

I Was Denied Boarding on a Cruise, and I Wasn’t the Only One.","On Aug. 6, my wife, my two children and I arrived at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal to board the MSC Meraviglia for a weeklong cruise that included a stop in the Bahamas. I am a scientist in the United States on a work visa and awaiting my green card, so I followed my lawyer’s instructions and presented my Chinese passport and my “combo card” — an American document that grants immigrants in my situation permission both to work in the United States and to travel abroad. But MSC Cruises refused to let me board, saying the card did not guarantee I would be readmitted to the country when the boat returned to Brooklyn. I soon met two other would-be travelers in the same, er, boat: Fadia, a 79-year-old Egyptian grandmother set to board with 19 relatives and friends, and Nargis, a Bangladeshi woman ready to cruise with her husband. After hours of pleading our case, even getting Fadia’s immigration lawyer to speak to staff by phone, we were all sent home. MSC refunded me about $500 in fees and taxes, but I’m still owed about $2,300 for the cruise fare for my family of four. Nargis and her husband have also not been reimbursed, nor have Fadia and her son (who stayed behind with her while the rest of the group sailed). Can you help?

2023-10-16,Is It a Moral Awakening or Just One Man’s Midlife Crisis?,"Philip Notman, the history professor protagonist of Rupert Thomson’s 14th novel, “Dartmouth Park,” is, by his own estimation, an essentially anonymous man, disguised by his education, Christianity, whiteness, heterosexuality and middle age. Long stuck in his ways, he isn’t expecting to have his life upended while returning to London from an academic conference in Norway, even after spending an unexpectedly memorable few days roving about with an enthralling younger sociologist from Cádiz named Inés Vaquero de Ayala. But an upending is exactly what happens to Philip when, on the way home, he experiences what he later calls his “Damascene moment” — a woman near him taps a travel card to get on the airport tram, and the mundane beep the card reader makes sends him into a brief but visceral fugue, wherein “his head began to float sideways and backward,” and he feels a sensation akin to a hand wrapping around his brain and squeezing, leaving him momentarily unable to think or react.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/books/review/dartmouth-park-rupert-thomson.html

2023-10-16,Earrings That Channel the Irregularity of the Universe,"Born in Mulhouse, France, in 1907, Jean Schlumberger was constantly sketching as a child. He dreamed of becoming an artist one day, but his parents, who hoped he’d take over the family textile business, sent him to Berlin to practice banking instead. In his early 20s, he defiantly moved to Paris and opened a jewelry workshop on Rue La Boétie, where he handcrafted delicate floral brooches out of Meissen porcelain, antique cameos and decorative Victorian objects he found at the Marché aux Puces. His fantastical creations soon captured the attention of the fashion world. After spotting Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark in a pair of his earrings in 1937, the Italian couturier Elsa Schiaparelli commissioned him to design buttons shaped like fruits and insects.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/t-magazine/tiffany-co-earrings-jean-schlumberger.html

2023-10-16,A Tequila Distiller Turns a House into a Showcase for Mexican Design,"IN 2008, WHEN the marketing executive Bertha González Nieves began brainstorming with the MTV creator Bob Pittman on what would become their cult tequila brand, Casa Dragones, she often stayed at the guesthouse he kept not far from his hillside estate in San Miguel de Allende, about 170 miles northwest of Mexico City. While Pittman’s house was grand, González Nieves’s living quarters, on a narrow plot on Calle Recreo, a bustling street in the middle of town, were relatively modest. Still, the property, hidden from passers-by behind a narrow cyan blue facade, was steeped in historic significance. Parts of the complex — three stand-alone buildings gathered around a courtyard, some containing only a single high-ceilinged room — dated to 1671. It had once been the site of stables for Dragones de la Reina, the cavalry regiment of Ignacio Allende, an army captain who helped Mexico gain independence from Spain in the early 19th century. How better to honor him, the entrepreneurs agreed, than to name both the house and the tequila after his troop?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/t-magazine/san-miguel-de-allende-casa-dragones.html

In his new novel, “Tremor,” all of Teju Cole’s capacities are present: the fiction writer of “Every Day Is for the Thief” (2007) and “Open City” (2011), the adventurous essayist of “Known and Strange Things” (2016), the Harvard professor, the devotee and practitioner of conceptually cool but classical photography.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/books/review/teju-cole-tremor.html

Four pages later, Thirlwell clears his throat — actually, Celine’s publicity troubles go back to the Big Bang: “The universe disintegrates into a cloud of heat, it falls inevitably into a vortex of entropy, but within this irreversible process there may be areas of order, portions of existence that tend toward a form, in which it might be possible to discern a design — and one of these was this story of Celine and her friends.” This could have gone without saying, but Thirlwell can’t help himself. In “The Future Future,” the English writer compulsively gestures to the biggest picture and decides it’s the gesture that’s profound.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/books/review/the-future-future-adam-thirlwell.html

But when we talked, she was so gentle. While preparing for the 25th anniversary of her dance company [in 1998], she sent me a telegram: “Yohji, do something for it.” That was it. So I did the costumes for Pina’s show (below, right).

It might also — depending on its genetic mix — resemble a crimson-speckled yellow orchid or a shocking pink peony. But it is, definitively, a vegetable: a herbaceous perennial descended from the ordinary blue chicory flower found by roadsides in Europe and North America. While chicory is also cultivated in the form of Belgian endive (the blanched, milky yellow root first harvested in Brussels in the 19th century) and puntarelle (spiny stalks famously beloved by Romans), radicchio is by far its most dramatic incarnation. “And the prettiest radicchios are the hardest to grow,” says Jessi Okamoto, one of the co-owners of Campo Rosso, the specialty vegetable farm in Pennsylvania that developed the Rosa di Campo Rosso. As with a handful of other varieties, the Rosa is beautiful, in part, because it has been lied to: In the fall, young plants are transferred from the field into a heated greenhouse, tricking them into a second round of growth and an overdressed debut amid December’s brassicas and tubers.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/t-magazine/radicchio-chicory.html

Today, Karlin releases a new furniture and lighting collection that is a study in contrasts rather than bound by an overarching theme. Among nine new lighting series, the Mulberry set, made from sinuous oak bentwood and delicate horn-shaped silk shades, is evocative of Art Nouveau, while the Field headboard, upholstered in an abstract floral-patterned crewel embroidery, is a nod to Arts and Crafts. Other designs include wrought-iron chairs, lanterns made from ecru-hued fiberglass and colored marble side tables. A totemic bar cabinet, inspired by massive 18th-century Swedish wood stoves called kakelugn, is clad in ceramic tiles adorned with glyphlike shapes that are a recurring motif in her work. Each piece revisits Karlin’s previous designs while experimenting with scale and material. “I’m really beginning to solidify my language,” says Karlin, who developed the collection over the past three years. “My alphabet is there, I just get to keep making new words.” From $4,250, annakarlin.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/t-magazine/canoa-lab-trnk.html

Touring late-19th-century houses, she noted the high ceilings, inlaid wood floors and carved moldings, all of which were beginning to buckle. “It felt like there had been a past that was so much more beautiful and vibrant,” Bindslev Henriksen says. That past is now the present: In short order, Portugal’s second-largest city has transformed from a quiet, industrious town into a lively creative hub. It is flush with concept shops and casual fine-dining restaurants. Young winemakers and sommeliers are bringing a fresh perspective to old vineyards. Expats are returning home to be part of the revival. Attribute some of it to the costs and crowds in other European destinations. But chefs and designers are also drawn to the innate charms of the city, whose roots go back thousands of years. The settlement on the Douro River near the Atlantic Ocean became an important port for the Romans, who dubbed it Portus Cale and are believed to have made wine along the riverbanks. The centuries brought other conquerors, including the Visigoths, the Spanish, the Moors and the French, and a wide range of architectural styles. The city’s historic center is a collection of medieval, Baroque, Gothic, and neo-Classical buildings, many with a through-line of local granite that continues into the present day.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/t-magazine/locals-guide-porto-portugal.html

Its Storico, run by Stephen Starr’s organization, closed in July. Next up is the Oberon Group from Brooklyn, where it runs Rucola, Rhodora, June Bar and more, with a focus on sustainability. Diego Moya, the group’s culinary director and a chef who rose to prominence during his pre-Covid stint at Racines, in TriBeCa, is the executive chef here, with Joseph Gaglio as his chef de cuisine. The restaurant takes its name from Clara Driscoll, who was in charge of the women’s glass-cutting department at Tiffany Studios from 1892 to 1909. She designed many Tiffany lamps, some of which are in the museum’s outstanding collection. A few Tiffany pieces and other items from that era fill the shelves that decorate the airy, off-white dining room but, like shards of truffle over pasta, not enough to make a statement. Mr. Moya’s menu has its eye on New York history with a lobster Newburg and a charlotte russe. Other dishes, like winter chicories with green goddess dressing, fluke crudo, carrot tartare, duck breast au poivre, steelhead trout and bay leaf mousse with burnt cranberries, depend on local and regional purveyors. The adjacent Café 77 for salads, sandwiches and other quick-serve items, run by Purslane, Oberon’s catering division, will open in two weeks.

2023-10-26,"Poem: Suddenly, Last Summer","Lisa Jarnot’s “Suddenly, Last Summer” develops, through ecstatic repetition, a theology of lostness. The sea-turtle hatchlings, with their instinctual desire to move toward light, risk this desire’s fatal consequence when knowing no better, they mistake the neon lights of the beach for the guiding light of the moon and stars over the water. So, too, the human voice of the poem begins lost — ready to worship but bereft of a God. In the “blue blue night” of despair, human and animal alike retain a creaturely innocence. Even the title — a pop-culture hand-me-down — underlines the innocence and ordinariness of a shared and painful predicament, the guiltless way any of us might find ourselves heading in the wrong direction. The small and unsatisfying light of the library and the deceptive brightness of the neon instigate the poem’s revelation: By these small lights, and with our fellow creatures, we learn there is a greater light to which we may return.

Trump’s presidency was a period not just of steady growth and low unemployment, but also of growth that was more widely shared than in much of the recent past — with the strongest improvement in median incomes since the 1990s, wage growth for middle- and low-income workers outpacing growth for the upper class, and the lowest African American unemployment rate in decades.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/opinion/american-dream-neoliberalism.html
2023-10-27,It’s Engagement Season — Here’s What to Get Your Soon-to-Be-Married Friends,"The intaglio — a stone engraved with an image — is a form of jewelry that goes back to ancient Mesopotamia. “In the Greek and Roman galleries at the Met, there’s a study room that’s full of intaglios,” says the New York-based jewelry designer Jean Prounis. For just over a year, her namesake brand, which often references ancient decorative arts, has been creating personalized intaglios in lapis, carnelian, onyx, jade or gold that can be set as rings or spinning pendants. Once you’ve chosen which of the settings and stones to offer your giftee, Prounis will, she says, ask you or the betrothed a series of questions about the couple’s relationship before suggesting a design, which is then etched on the stone by a specialized intaglio carver.

It was a cloudless morning in mid-August in Middlebury, Vt., and I had gone to meet Nunez, a petite woman of almost suspicious good cheer, to talk about her half-century-long writing career. She had come up from her home in New York City to give a reading — from her new, ninth novel, “The Vulnerables,” which appears this week — at the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference. Through time, Robert Frost, Toni Morrison and George R.R. Martin have all read at Bread Loaf. Nunez was joining those names, an unlikely advent. She didn’t publish a novel until she was in her 40s and wasn’t able to live on her writing until — 47 years after she began — she won the National Book Award, at 67, for “The Friend.” That novel became an international best seller, translated into more than 30 languages. I wondered how Nunez had managed such persistence. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/magazine/sigrid-nunez.html
