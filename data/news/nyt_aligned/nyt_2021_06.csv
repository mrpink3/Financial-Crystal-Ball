He opened it just four years ago with Jean-Georges Vongerichten as its marquee chef. Now he is introducing a Peruvian star, Diego Muñoz, to New York to create the food at Popular, the new signature restaurant on the property, and also to oversee the adjacent Cantina & Pisco Bar. Among Mr. Muñoz’s credits are the kitchens of Astrid y Gastón in Lima, Peru, and the Edition in Bodrum, Turkey, another Schrager hotel, as well as other projects in Peru. Working alongside Mr. Muñoz will be John Fraser, another chef in Mr. Schrager’s lineup, who will attend mainly to the restaurant management side of things. Mr. Schrager noted that this collaboration of two top chefs was something he has never done. Mr. Fraser will also curate the prepared grab-and-go items, including some by Mr. Muñoz, at Louis, a ground-floor market and coffee bar. The Cantina & Pisco Bar is a pair of marble counters, one with fresh fish on display for ceviche made to order, the other for cocktails starring pisco. There is also table seating. Popular has indoor and outdoor seating for a menu highlighting the multicultural traditions — African, Chinese, Incan, Italian, Japanese and Spanish  — that shape Peruvian cuisine in many seafood preparations, and also in dishes like papa a la Huancaína, a classic Peruvian potato dish; filet mignon saltado, a dressier version of the staple; salmon tiradito for the Japanese influence; and wood-smoked seafood paella, plus the inevitable burger. There are three wood ovens. On the Cantina & Pisco Bar menu will be razor clams, and hearts of palm with avocado. Louis will offer a ceviche bowl, Peruvian-style sandwiches and also a loaded Chrystie Street kosher hot dog; Mr. Muñoz will be coming up with cocktails at Cantina and Popular, many based on pisco, the grape spirit of Peru. Peruvian and South American selections dominate the wine list. (Opens June 12; reservations accepted from June 5.)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

It was a Black city. Following the Watts Rebellion — the uprisings that took place in August 1965 in the predominantly Black Watts neighborhood, just north of Compton in southern Los Angeles — white residents who hadn’t already left the area were desperate to get out. By the end of that decade, Compton’s population, which had previously been mostly white, was about 70 percent Black. “The difference between Compton in 1959 and in 1969 is almost like night and day,” says Robert Lee Johnson, a local historian. When the city elected Douglas Dollarhide, its first Black mayor, in 1969, he came into office with a majority Black school board and an entirely Black City Council. But keeping the city middle class was an uphill battle. The mass relocation of white-owned businesses led to sweeping job losses and soon Compton, which had formerly been “known for its housing and schools,” Johnson says, couldn’t afford to maintain either, let alone support the arts.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/t-magazine/compton-communicative-arts-academy.html

2021-06-03,What Will My Son Remember of This Horrible Year?,"“Daddy, let’s play hide-and-seek with the virus,” my son said a little over a year ago. I was surprised and saddened that at barely 2 years old he would talk about the coronavirus with such familiarity, but it made sense. The pandemic had already started to transform his life — for good and for ill, because he missed the walks through Chapultepec Park just as intensely as he rejoiced over his canceled classes (he didn’t like his incipient school life at all). Hiding from the virus, in any case, was more reasonable than hiding from the ceiling or the refrigerator, as he would often suggest to me then, or from the Bible or Shakespeare’s complete works, as I would suggest to him. So we huddled under the table and screamed fake screams of fear — fake because they were whispered imitations of screams, and also because the fear was fake, in theory, though at that moment I did feel fear. Or maybe it was fatalism — a fatalism that now, in light of events, strikes me as a barely diminished version of optimism.

He has also been criticized for pioneering the militarization of the police and espousing the racist theories of eugenics. What’s rarely talked about, however, is that he began his tenure as the head of the police department of Berkeley, Calif., in 1905 by forcing all of his deputies to resign — arguably a kind of early experiment in abolishing the police.

The Moomins were a visually and narratively original concept, a gentle family of hippopotamus-shaped trolls who lived with their friends in a valley, where all pursued adventure and mischief.

2021-06-08,"New Audiobooks From Seth Rogen, Danielle Henderson and Elon Green","The only thing more essential to a road trip than an audiobook is gas. I often spend as much time selecting the listening material for a long drive as I do mapping the itinerary, and I’ve seldom made a better choice than LAST CALL: A TRUE STORY OF LOVE, LUST, AND MURDER IN QUEER NEW YORK (Macmillan Audio, 8 hours, 11 minutes), by Elon Green. Recently, my husband and I listened to this true-crime stunner on a drive from North Carolina to New York, and the hours flew by as quickly as the landscape. In 1991, a Pennsylvania Turnpike maintenance worker opened an unusually heavy trash bag and found a mutilated body: “It looked like a loaf of bread,” he recalls, “but then I saw freckles.” The freckles belonged to a gay man, a divorced banker and father who’d last been seen at a Midtown Manhattan piano bar called the Townhouse. Just over a year later, workers emptying trash cans at a rest stop in New Jersey found a bloody bag containing a human head. It belonged to a closeted gay man, a married father of four who had also last been seen at the Townhouse. These were the first known victims of the so-called Last Call Killer, who went on to murder at least two more gay men the next year. The nearly decade-long and sometimes bungled hunt for the serial murderer gives the book its suspense. Green’s sensitive portraits of the victims, and his deeply researched re-creation of an epoch of gay history, provide its soul. Inherently shocking material needs no dramatization, and David Pittu’s understated narration highlights the tragedy and horror of these crimes. “Last Call” is the kind of book that keeps you wide awake all night turning the pages. As an audiobook, it will keep you wide awake all day as you drive, hoping you don’t get wherever you’re going before it ends.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/books/review/seth-rogen-yearbook-danielle-henderson-ugly-cry-last-call-elon-green-audiobooks.html

2021-06-15,A New Source for Seafood,"Buying seafood online has never been easier, thanks to the demands of all the stay-at-home cooks during the pandemic. There is a proliferation of new sources, and one of them, E-Fish, is the outgrowth of a wholesale company that started selling fresh fish from various sources to restaurants last year. “Chefs had to deal with individual fishermen and it was complicated for them, but by aggregating we made it easier,” said Jeff Tedmori, the chief executive and a graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of Management. He came up with the idea with his business partner and the chief operating officer Matthew Henderson, whose family has been in the fish business for generations. Soon after they saw that the fishermen on their roster could not do enough business with so many restaurants closed, they opened for consumer sales. They say most of their products are harvested to order and shipped within a day. What is especially appealing for those of us in the East is that they carry some West Coast varieties that we rarely see, like succulent petrale sole, California king salmon and live spot prawns. Jean-Georges Vongerichten is on the company’s chef advisory board. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/dining/e-fish-seafood-shop.html

2021-06-16,The Last Downtown Gallery,"One day in the summer of 1982, the art dealers Penny Pilkington and Wendy Olsoff were driving through the English countryside when their car broke down. The two had met the previous year as entry-level employees at Theo Waddington Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Though their day jobs were uptown, and they lived in a two-bedroom railroad apartment three blocks away, splitting the rent of $750, the pair shared a disinterest in the art they saw there — Waddington showed Fauvists and Inuit artists, while his neighbors were mainly gentlemanly dealers of old masters, Impressionists and male abstract painters. Pilkington and Olsoff were young, in their mid-20s, but they were also gutsy, no-nonsense and imaginative, and they began to fantasize about opening their own space together. They had traveled to the U.K., in part, to visit Pilkington’s parents, who ran London’s Piccadilly Gallery, which focused on turn-of-the-20th-century European art. But that summer day, as would happen both literally and figuratively at various points in their working relationship, they found themselves stranded at the side of the road. After looking under the car’s hood, Olsoff recalls, Pilkington removed her stockings, as if this were a very normal thing to do, and tied them in place to create a makeshift replacement for the blown-out fan belt. “It worked for just long enough to get to the next garage,” Pilkington recalls.

His new neighbors had warned the multimedia producer about the nutty lady on the ninth floor — every building has one, they joked — with her querulous duo of pug dogs toted in a baby carriage, and nonstop pronouncements issued in an archaic highbrow accent straight out of “The Philadelphia Story.” Vaczy, then 36, was instantly enchanted. Growing up in a working-class Long Island family, he had been involved in the early 1980s punk scene and was familiar with Berlin’s lore of the Pop movement, though it took him a while to connect the dots, to figure out that the woman who lived four floors above him had starred in Andy Warhol’s films and was in his inner circle for more than 20 years. Vaczy knew her as the society girl manquée who got fat expressly to spite a controlling mother, and who earned the nickname Brigid Polk at the Factory, Warhol’s studio, because she loved to “poke” herself — and anyone in the vicinity — with a hypodermic needle of amphetamines. She had always scoffed at the idea that she was an artist, but friends like Robert Rauschenberg and the sculptor John Chamberlain regarded her as an equal. John Waters once described her as “big, often naked and ornery as hell.” That afternoon at the elevator she asked Vaczy if he wanted to come up to her apartment for five minutes. “But with Brigid, there was no five minutes,” he says. “We wound up drinking all night and watching ‘Dr. Zhivago.’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/t-magazine/brigid-berlin-andy-warhol.html

2021-06-21,A Chef Looks Back on the Locavore Life,"Has it really been 10 years since Peter Hoffman closed Savoy, his steadfastly locavore gem on the edge of SoHo? Seems like yesterday. His new book, “What’s Good?,” is a lively memoir covering the arc of the restaurant’s life span, with plenty of detours into his suburban childhood; his culinary awakening; his wife and family; his interest in botany, plant genetics, biology and history; and the evolution of New York’s restaurant world. He has reason to be proud of his farm-to-table approach early in the game that depended on the nearby Union Square Greenmarket. Each chapter features a different ingredient (14 of them total), which became highlights in the restaurant, with an appropriate recipe or two for each. Leeks figure prominently. The restaurant opened in 1990 and closed in 2011, a victim of economics and the changes in SoHo, and was always a work in progress, like Mr. Hoffman’s own career. Back Forty and Back Forty West, his other places, had briefer runs. Mr. Hoffman says that he has no plans to open another New York restaurant. But another book? That’s possible.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/dining/savoy-peter-hoffman-book.html

Purists will insist that the yeast-raised buns be filled only with sweetened fruit or cheese, but in Texas, savory versions with sausage, eggs, chiles and the like are wildly popular. At the new Greenwich Village store, where everything is made from scratch, sausage from nearby Faicco’s is used in the Bleecker Kolache. A perennial item, the Pride Roll, with cinnamon and rainbow sprinkles, is sold this month with the profits donated to the Ali Forney Center to help homeless L.G.B.T.Q. youth.

Dacus had already drawn on her own life for the wry and charged songs on her first two solo albums, “No Burden” (2016) and “Historian” (2018), but “Thumbs” — a confessional song about a violent impulse felt toward a close friend’s abusive father — with its blunt reminder that a survivor owes an oppressor exactly nothing, resonated particularly deeply with her fans. “I’ve probably received more messages about that song than anything else I’ve written,” Dacus told me recently.

This year, she smartly delayed her birthday by a couple of weeks and was able to spend it with a few healthy, vaccinated friends during a sunny weekend on Fire Island. I said I’d bring the birthday lunch. Given the terrible associations we’ve all just had with the measurement of six feet, I wanted to somehow “reclaim” the language and take the gloom out of it, so of course a six-foot hero came to mind.

Almost everyone had been working at home since the firm was started in spring 2020, so when the founder, Chris James, went into the office for a rare visit on May 26 this year to watch the results during Exxon Mobil’s annual shareholder meeting, he propped his computer up on a rented desk. As an activist investor, he had bought millions of dollars’ worth of shares in Exxon Mobil to put forward four nominees to the board. His candidates needed to finish in the top 12 of the 16 up for election, and he was nervous. Since December, James and the firm’s head of active engagement, Charlie Penner, had been making their case that America’s most iconic oil company needed new directors to help it thrive in an era of mounting climate urgency. In response, Exxon Mobil expanded its board to 12 directors from 10 and announced a $3 billion investment in a new initiative it called Low Carbon Solutions. James paced around the empty office and texted Penner: “I was doing bed karate this morning thinking about how promises made at gunpoint are rarely kept.

Grand Bahama and the Abacos were once covered in dark green foliage that complemented the emerald waters; now long stretches had faded to brown, even gray. Two-story waves had blown apart wide sections of shoreline. Once-gorgeous mangrove swamps — habitat for algae and crabs and bonefish, and the land’s defense against a storm’s surge — were overwhelmed by Dorian’s salt water, and large swaths of them lay dead, their brittle shells shimmering in the heat. The same fate befell the abundant indigenous Caribbean pine trees, which take decades to grow to their towering heights of over 100 feet.

And “Triage,” after a few lines from “In the Hospital” by Boris Pasternak, is one of these beauties.

In 1980, about 5 percent of the country’s children between 2 and 19 were experiencing obesity, according to the C.D.C.; as of 2018, more than 19 percent were — and an additional 16 percent were considered overweight. Because children are far more likely to gain an unhealthful amount of weight while out of school over the summer, experts were worried last spring when in-person schooling was suspended indefinitely because of the pandemic. They feared extended closures might “exacerbate the epidemic of childhood obesity and increase disparities in obesity risk,” as researchers from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and colleagues put it in a paper in the journal Obesity in June 2020. That, in turn, would mean more children living with related conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and fatty-liver disease.

Although human history teems with people engulfed by abrupt aridity — the Akkadians of four millenniums ago, the Maya in the ninth and 10th centuries A.D., the Great Plains farmers of the 1930s — even today drought is a poorly appreciated phenomenon. Unlike mighty storms or thundering eruptions, droughts slink into our lives invisibly, unannounced. It can be hard to know you’re in a drought until it’s too late to do much about it; then, when the rains come back, it can be just as difficult to believe the water will ever run out again, so why worry about the next dry spell?
