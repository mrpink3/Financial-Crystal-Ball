2019-11-01,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Dickinson’ and ‘American Son’,"DICKINSON Stream on Apple TV Plus. Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like “dude” and “sick” in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apple’s new streaming service. “Dickinson,” which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the show’s creator, Alena Smith, described “Dickinson” as “a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time.” The tone calls to mind teen dramas like “Riverdale.” Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. “If she wasn’t that well understood in her time,” Smith asked, “can we understand her better in ours?”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-dickinson-and-american-son.html

2019-11-04,A Farmed Striped Bass Worth Roasting,"Wild striped bass, also called stripers or rockfish, are a treasure. Nothing quite compares with the sleek, muscular fish. Until now, farmed versions have been a hybrid with little flavor or succulence. But a new kind of farmed striped bass has come on the market that’s not a hybrid; it is genuine Morone saxatilis, the same as the wild fish. They are being raised in deep waters of the Pacific off northern Baja California. The company, Pacifico, says it has an agreement with the Mexican government for the only aquafarm in that area, a marine sanctuary with no industry nearby. The fish are raised on feed made mostly from the trimmings of other fish. I roasted a one-and-a-half pounder, cleaned and scaled but whole, with a fillet of wild striped bass alongside to compare them. The thick flesh of the wild fillet, from a big fish, was firm yet silky; the texture of the farmed fish was less firm. As for the flavor, they were similar, though the farmed fish was not as rich.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/dining/pacifico-striped-bass.html

AronChupa and Little Sis Nora. “Rave in the Grave” defies description in many ways, but if I were pushed into a corner, I would say that it had an “electro burlesque” feel and reminded me that Tim Burton has a lot to answer for. If I were further pushed, I would say that I am sorry to have heard it, because it will be with me always now, but that I liked the idea of someone in the Faroe Islands — this sparsely populated Danish archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic where they have developed a specialized term for the problem of falling off a cliff, so often does it happen because of the sudden onset of fog — jerking back from the radio in bewildered disgust at the same moment that I did in my kitchen in Cape Town.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-radio-garden.html

As a young woman, I starved myself, only learning to eat at 26, after my mother overdosed on her medication and died. Still, I recoiled from cameras, fearful that photos would reveal that I, too, was fat. At 38, I found a letter she’d sent me at camp: “It’s so lonely without you. I love + miss you A LOT.” I wept. That night, my fiancée, Shannon, took my picture. Studying my breasts, stomach, thighs, I saw my mother. “I love you, too,” I said, silently, as if in prayer. — Leanne Milech",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-i-couldnt-breathe-or-cancel.html

Designed by David Rockwell, it has polished wood, butterscotch leather and a soaring bar with multiple wine racks. It also provides a view of the Vessel, the complex’s centerpiece. The restaurant’s creators, Kenneth A. Himmel, a developer and restaurateur, with Marvin R. Shanken, the publisher of Wine Spectator and other magazines, describe it as an American brasserie. The chef, Eli Kaimeh, of Gramercy Tavern and Per Se, has responded in turn, creating a menu featuring a chopped salad, beef tartare, fancy pork and beans, steak-frites, herb-crusted sea bass, rotisserie chicken and a chocolate-orange creamsicle dessert. “We hope to appeal to the broadest spectrum possible,” Mr. Himmel said. “I believe that you shouldn’t be challenged by a menu.” Mr. Shanken has worked with the beverage director, the master sommelier Michaël Engelmann, to create the elaborate wine list. It includes a nice selection of wines by the glass and the half-bottle, as well as a large assortment of top-flight spirits. A second floor member-only dining club is to open in a few weeks.

You’ve stood on top of all of them. And their spirit — and their souls — are in that floor.” She’s talking about the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the venerated launching pad of several generations of musicians, comics and other performers. Directed by Roger Ross Williams, “The Apollo” digs into the theater’s rich, 85-year history through a trove of archival performance footage (Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and James Brown are among those featured) and recent interviews, which it intersperses with scenes of the preparation and performance of a stage version of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me” that debuted last year. The results are “conventional but entertaining,” Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The New York Times. “While ‘The Apollo’ itself might have taken a more inventive approach,” he added, “it derives its power from the artistry it captures.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

2019-11-06,How This 71-Year-Old Video Art Pioneer Became a TikTok Star,"ONE RECENT WEEKDAY, I was sitting with the video artist and retired professor Cecelia Condit in the dining room of her fairly nondescript apartment in the upper-middle-class Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood, Wis. The space also doubles as Condit’s studio, but other than a laptop and a few hard drives, scant evidence of a working artist could be found. Over grapes and pudding, we watched my iPhone, which was spitting out audio from “Possibly in Michigan,” Condit’s brutal, surreal and darkly funny 1983 art musical that is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Shot using then nascent video technology and set to an eerily chipper Casio-fueled soundtrack provided by Karen Skladany, who also acted in the film, the 12-minute “Possibly in Michigan” follows a masked cannibal named Arthur — played by, at different points, Condit and the actors Bill Blume and Stephen Vogel — as he stalks Jill Sands (playing a character named Sharon) and Skladany (as Sharon’s friend Janice) through a nondescript Middle American shopping mall. (Despite its name, the video was filmed in Cleveland, where Condit was living at the time.) The cannibal follows the women home, at which point he’s murdered and then eaten himself. The film ends with the body being disposed in a couple of trash bags and picked up by a local garbage collector.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/t-magazine/possibly-in-michigan-tiktok-artist.html

Falstaff, the usually rotund companion to Prince Hal (the future King Henry V), is played here by a relatively lean Joel Edgerton, opposite Timothée Chalamet as a stylish Hal-Henry. The film focuses on Hal’s evolution from sot to sovereign, ditching Shakespeare’s language in favor of a modern English script by Edgerton and David Michôd, who also directs. The story builds up to a climactic Battle of Agincourt, with help from a supporting cast that includes Ben Mendelsohn, who plays an ailing King Henry IV, and Robert Pattinson. “Michôd has a gift for screen violence and is generally good with actors,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, “yet time and again your attention drifts from Hal-Henry to the story’s edges, where the supporting actors nibble at their tasty bits.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-king-and-farming.html

To study the effectiveness of international rules against anonymous, untraceable shell companies, Sharman and two other researchers impersonated 21 different fictitious consultants and sent 7,400 emails to 3,700 so-called corporate service providers (often law or accounting firms) in 182 countries, asking for help setting one up. Nearly half the respondents failed to comply with regulations requiring the collection of identity documents. The conclusion: It is more than three times as hard to put an untraceable shell company in an offshore tax haven than in a developed country. For anonymity, set up your company in Nevada, Delaware or Wyoming; it can be done in 10 to 40 minutes, and for as little as $200.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/magazine/how-to-set-up-a-shell-company.html

Fuming and raging, lashing out at his familiars, he is a chain-smoking wild beast being kept in cultural captivity. His growing fame brings admirers to his freezing workshop, where they wonder at his ascetic indifference to discomfort, and still more — gifted as he surely is — at his capacity for self-criticism. Not that his manhood can be in any doubt: He flaunts his ravishing young mistress before his careworn, miserable wife, who nonetheless remains his devoted slave in the fervent belief that she is the one who truly understands him. In one scene, in a fit of furious dissatisfaction, he hurls a sheaf of sketches into a flaming brazier before a group of astonished onlookers. The camera shows the horror on their faces as they watch the artworks burn, a horror it is assumed we share. It isn’t just the sight of Giacometti’s sketches going up in smoke that appalls us; it’s the fact that, to our retrospective eyes, he might as well be burning thousand-dollar bills.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/magazine/women-art-celia-paul-cecily-brown.html

As soon as I read the first scene, in which a stranger chides Sasha for crying at a bar (“Sometimes I’m just as unhappy as you are.

The film focuses on the toll that the policy took during its decades of enforcement (China embraced the policy in the late 1970s and ended it in 2015). It uses Wang’s own family and story as a way in, combining her narration with interviews with people who felt the effects of the policy in different, troubling ways. It’s an emotionally intense topic that Wang and Zhang address “with clarity, concision and strategically restrained outrage,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “I’ve watched ‘One Child Nation’ twice, at times through tears,” she added, “but there’s nothing in it that’s gratuitously exploitative. It is instead an essential account of one battle in the continuing war over women’s bodies, one that, Wang forcefully observes, is in no way limited to China.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-one-child-nation-and-great-performances.html

He trained as an architect and has worked as a D.J., artist, musician and Kanye West whisperer. When it comes to fashion, his references are equally wide-ranging, and he’s proved as likely to send trench coats and pleated pants down the runway as mesh tees and floral harnesses. With his latest capsule collection, he’s baked versatility into individual pieces. Included in the 14-item line, called Louis Vuitton 2054 (the year the brand will turn 200), is a shirt that turns into a pillow, a weekend bag that morphs into a sleeping bag and a coat that doubles as a backpack. It was, according to Abloh, an exercise in rethinking the nature of apparel and what the future of fashion will be. He arrived at his answer — technical and transformable — after looking at collapsible camping equipment. “I was very much inspired by the materials and folding ingenuity that exists in that world of products,” Abloh said, in comments emailed by the brand. Indeed, folding is an integral component in experiencing these multifunctional items: The shirt, papery nylon with removable arms and plexiglass zipper pulls, can be tucked into its own back pocket, and the sleeping bag rolls out of the side compartment of an oversize lambskin duffel.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/t-magazine/louis-vuitton-2054-aman-kyoto-news.html

The brand’s spring 2019 collection, for example, was a celebration of the gay and trans communities and proceeds from a raffle at the show went to the Transgender Law Center. “Representation is a pillar of how we work,” says Leon.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/t-magazine/opening-ceremony-hats.html

2019-11-11,David Byrne and David Binder on Breaking Into the Mainstream,"One measure of artistic success is the ability to move the mainstream — to bring once-unimaginable ideas to the widest possible audience. By that metric, few people have been as successful as the musician David Byrne and the producer David Binder. Byrne, of course, headlined the ’80s rock band Talking Heads, which dissolved the barriers between disco and rock, conceptual art and dance pop. Even before going solo in 1989, Byrne’s side projects tentacled into disparate worlds: He collaborated with similarly polymathic artists such as Brian Eno, Robert Wilson and Twyla Tharp; he starred in the writer-director Jonathan Demme’s 1984 documentary “Stop Making Sense”; and two years later, he directed the Robert Altman-on-acid jukebox art film “True Stories.” In the ’90s and beyond, Byrne used his fame to advance and collaborate with a wide range of artists — the world-music acts on his label, Luaka Bop; the D.J. Fatboy Slim on “Here Lies Love,” their 2013 musical about Imelda Marcos; the singer St. Vincent on their joint 2012 album “Love This Giant.” His latest act of radical pop is “American Utopia,” an album and touring rock show (which debuted in 2018) that wears its theme lightly but seriously reimagines space: Mobile musicians hop across a bare stage, dancing to their own music. The work opened on Broadway last month and runs through Feb. 16.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/t-magazine/david-byrne-binder.html

As the 25-year-old pilot of a B-24 Liberator, my grandfather flew in some of the most decisive engagements of the war, including the Battle of Anzio and the second Ploesti oil-field raids. Upon completing his tour, he was transferred to the Eighth Air Force just in time to fly bombing runs on D-Day. According to his discharge papers, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross and two Air Medals before being sent to Texas in August 1944. He spent the remainder of the war training new bomber pilots near El Paso, a job he liked to joke was scarier than combat and in reality was hardly less dangerous. Driving through the area with my uncle several years later, he pointed to a mountain looming over the edge of town. “See all those craters?” he said. “Those were made by new guys.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/magazine/survivor-guilt-veteran.html

In the years since, the 41-year-olds have gone from stars on the rise to stalwarts, creating consistently wearable clothes that nonetheless experiment with proportion, cut, fabric and form — and that have defined (and dressed) the downtown cool girl for over a decade.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/t-magazine/proenza-schouler-inspiration.html

Formed around a central caldera and characterized by lunar-like rock formations, it has the highest concentration of beaches in the entire island group — and yet, it’s delightfully untrodden compared to its more famous neighbors, Santorini and Mykonos. It was once a critical location for the mineral trade — during the Neolithic period, the ancient Minoans exported Milos’s obsidian to the neighboring Aegean island of Crete, whose residents used the volcanic glass to make weapons — but the island is best known because of an event from more recent history. It was while digging near the Roman amphitheater in Klima, in 1820, that the amateur archaeologist Olivier Voutier discovered the marble statue known as the “Venus de Milo.” The celebrated work now lives at the Louvre in Paris, but Milos’s mystique remains intact. Thanks to its serene fishing villages, secluded caves, innumerable swimming beaches (many accessible only by boat) and an abundance of locally run restaurants offering fresh catch and regional Greek wines, this tranquil island is quickly gaining appeal for travelers who want Aegean charm without the crowds.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/t-magazine/milos-greece-travel-guide.html

The movie centers on Jesper, a mailman voiced by Jason Schwartzman who partners with a hermitlike toymaker named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) to deliver trinkets to children on the island. It is the first feature directed by Sergio Pablos, an animator and screenwriter whose decades-long history working with Disney informs this movie’s look. “It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable ‘but I can explain’ bit, are entirely digestible,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “These clichés inhibit ‘Klaus’ from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it’s worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library (not that, as a Netflix offering, it will take up any physical space).”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-santa-claus-and-sonny-liston.html

He used video, drawing, installation, sculpture and found objects — sometimes all in the course of a single piece — to examine the darkest corners of his own subconscious and memory, often hinting at a mysterious, unspoken trauma that is revisited again and again but never quite defined.

2019-11-19,Will Science Ever Give Us a Better Night’s Sleep?,"We humans spend a third of our lives asleep, oblivious to our surroundings and temporarily paralyzed. It’s a vulnerability that would seem to diminish our odds of survival, so evolutionarily speaking it must also somehow confer tremendous benefits. Yet our best guesses about what those benefits are tend to come from observing what happens when sleep is curtailed. As far as we know, all animals sleep in some way; deprive most of them of it for long enough, and they will die, but exactly why is unclear. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society published a joint statement, based on a comprehensive review of research, saying that “sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis” — which is the case for an estimated 35 to 40 percent of Americans during the workweek — is associated with adverse health outcomes. These include weight gain and obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and stroke, depression, impaired immune function, increased pain, greater likelihood of accidents and “increased risk of death.” The National Institutes of Health reported last year that sleep deficits may increase the beta-amyloid proteins in the brain linked with Alzheimer’s disease. But when it comes to “what sleep is, how much you need and what it’s for,” says Louis Ptacek, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, “we know almost nothing — other than it’s bad not to get enough of it.” Indeed, says David Dinges, one of the statement’s authors and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, “All of this makes it really tough to send out simple messages to the public about when you should sleep and how much you should sleep.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/magazine/will-science-ever-give-us-a-better-nights-sleep.html

Three broad staircases (and two elevators) lead to a grid of wide aisles lined with food stands and larger restaurant areas, punctuated with clusters of tables and benches. Most diners and shoppers will regard the two markets as a single multistory feast, but what distinguishes the Market Line from its upstairs neighbor is the greater availability of alcohol. There’s the Grand Delancey, a 200-seat beer garden; and Peoples Wine Shop and Bar, from Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra of Contra restaurant, with Daryl Nunn as manager. A cocktail bar will open soon. The beer garden has no food of its own, but you can order something to eat from some of the other stalls, and waiters will bring it to you. Some Schaller & Weber bratwurst with that I.P.A., perhaps? There’s a multicultural mix, offering handmade tortillas from Tortilleria Nixtamal, Veselka’s Ukrainian food and Puerto Rican fare from Que Chevere, among others. There will be mushroom-based drinks from Four Sigmatic, Southeast Asian desserts from Moon Man, and Ends Meat butcher and salumeria from Industry City. At Essex Pearl, you can buy a fish, have it grilled and eat it on the spot. There’s also a branch of the nearby Tenement Museum, and the museum’s food tours will now terminate in the Market Line.

At 75, she has had a long, storied, multi-hyphenate career as a painter, poet, dancer, teacher, curator and theater designer. She’s not a fan of the word “career” either: “It’s my life’s work,” she says. “There’s just a lot of things to be interested in.” Jackson traces that attitude back to her childhood in 1940s and ’50s pre-statehood Alaska, where a certain pioneering spirit prevailed. “We just did things,” she remembers. She went to college at San Francisco State University at 17, studying art, drama and dance; toured South America as a ballerina; and in 1967, moved to Los Angeles, where she tooled around town in a Buick Hearse, took drawing classes from Charles White, began showing her paintings at the influential Ankrum gallery and, in 1968, opened Gallery 32, the community-minded space she ran out of her studio near MacArthur Park for two years. There, she hosted exhibitions by emerging black artists like David Hammons and Betye Saar, as well as a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. As a single mother in her 40s with her son in tow, she earned a graduate degree in theater design at Yale, worked on productions with the Kennedy Center and the Berkeley Repertory Theater and eventually settled in Georgia in the mid-90s to teach at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She has now lived and worked in the city for two decades, in a rambling, three-story, double-wide 1890s house that she owns in the historic Starland district.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/t-magazine/suzanne-jackson-artist.html

2019-11-25,A Cocktail Necklace That Demands Attention,"Alec Waugh, brother of the novelist Evelyn, claimed in a 1974 Esquire interview to have invented the cocktail party, though a St. Louis socialite, Clara Bell Walsh, is often credited with throwing the first pre-dinner soiree devoted exclusively to mixed drinks in 1917. Amid the giddiness of the post-World War I period, when women began to assert themselves more at social events and Prohibition made booze alluringly naughty, dimly lit get-togethers became fashionable. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the era also saw the birth of cocktail jewelry: massive gems, both precious and semiprecious, in rings and pendants, made to be brazenly visible even in low light. By the 1940s, Tiffany & Co. was known for such oversize pieces, especially with aquamarine surrounded by diamonds. The ice-blue mineral, which, like emerald, is part of the beryl family, gets its color from traces of iron; it is among the hardest stones, resulting in larger, flawlessly clear crystal formations. This new pendant, with a 43-carat cushion-cut aquamarine dangling from a 21-inch rope of diamond rondels, is impossible to miss — glinting audaciously even in starlight or the first blush of dawn. 2019 Tiffany Blue Book Collection, price on request, (800) 518-5555.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/t-magazine/tiffany-cocktail-necklace.html

Morissette wrote the song — which became the fourth track on “Jagged Little Pill,” an album so popular at its height that it sold nearly half a million copies in one week — in less than an hour when she was 20. The lyrics are more affective than logical, more moody than meticulous.

2019-11-26,"‘The Cartiers: The Untold Story Behind the Jewelry Empire,’ by Francesca Cartier Brickell: An Excerpt","A few years ago, four generations of my family gathered at my grandfather’s house in the South of France to celebrate his ninetieth birthday. As we all sat on the terrace that warm July morning, enjoying our usual holiday breakfast of fresh croissants and jam, I barely stopped to think how this wonderful man at the head of the table had lived through more than we could imagine. Born in 1919, Jean-Jacques Cartier had—like so many of his remarkable generation—witnessed cataclysmic world events firsthand. He’d seen the devastating lows of the Depression and fought in the Second World War. He had experienced more years of the Roaring Twenties than of the twenty-first century. And yet, that day, watching him open his birthday cards, he was simply Grandpa, with his neatly combed white hair and mustache and smiling blue eyes. But all that was about to change. I was just moments away from making a discovery that would bring me face-to-face with not only his past but the lives of many of my ancestors.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/books/review/the-cartiers-the-untold-story-behind-the-jewelry-empire-by-francesca-cartier-brickell-an-excerpt.html

Especially the factory, where gigantic presses could smash his hands and crush them, make nubs of his fingers. The machines crashed and pounded, and the huge wheels at the tops of the presses turned, and Tiny slid his little piece of metal under the die and hooked both hands on the buttons, and the presses turned over and came down with unbelievable force and stamped out one part at a time. He hooked the part with a little rubber suction cup on a rod, drew it safely out of the way, and inserted another piece, inhaling the exhaust of the Towmotors while standing on a skid to raise himself up to the level where other men stood.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/books/review/tiny-love-the-complete-stories-by-larry-brown-an-excerpt.html

Days, if you’re doing it the old-fashioned way: salting pieces of mango and letting the jars sit in the sun, until the fruit has softened, released all its juices and lightened in color. This salt-preserved fruit, after about five days, is mixed with a powerful sludge of spices that include turmeric and crushed fenugreek and cumin seeds, staining the pickle with color and deepening its flavor — a hot, sour, salty tang that amplifies as the pickle continues to ferment for a few more days.

The “he” there is Martin Scorsese, and the film is “The Irishman,” Scorsese’s new mob epic, which deals with made men, hits and betrayals, and with aging and legacy. Robert De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a former hit man who tells the story of his life in organized crime. (He is based on a real person.) That story, seen in flashbacks that make up a large part of the movie, revolves around work for a Mafia figure played by Joe Pesci and, ultimately, and involves the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa (played by Pacino). Bobby Cannavale, Anna Paquin and Ray Romano are in the film’s ensemble. “The movie is long and dark: long like a novel by Dostoyevsky or Dreiser, dark like a painting by Rembrandt,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. “This is Scorsese’s least sentimental picture of mob life,” Scott added, “and for that reason his most poignant.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-the-irishman-and-julie-julia.html

Nicaraguans have no particular use for the spice, which has yet to make inroads in the local diet.

Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Without letting go of its grounding in the lives and desires of its characters, especially Ada, it becomes an unusual kind of ghost story, more unnerving than terrifying, a supernatural fable of resistance and revenge.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-atlantics-and-the-report.html

He credits his paternal grandmother with sparking his love of beauty, saying, “She always set a lovely table and she made all her own clothes — and mine.” After graduating from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp, where he studied women’s wear, in 1998, Van Assche was offered an internship designing men’s wear for Yves Saint Laurent; unsure if he wanted to live in Paris, he decided it would be a good placeholder until he found other work in London, Milan or New York. But then he met Hedi Slimane, at the time the brand’s creative director of men’s wear, whom he followed to Dior Homme in 2000.

Since the 1950s, Sánchez, who is now 93, has dared to expand the dimensional constraints of painting with boundless ingenuity, conceiving a new visual language for sensuality.
