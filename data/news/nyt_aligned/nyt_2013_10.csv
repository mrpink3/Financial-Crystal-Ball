2013-10-01,Greece: A Vow to Erase a ‘Shame’," Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece suggested on Monday that he wanted to eradicate Golden Dawn, the neo-fascist xenophobic political party that is now facing a major government crackdown on charges it is a criminal organization involved in murder, attempted murder, blackmail and other crimes. Mr. Samaras, who was visiting New York for the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, said in a reception sponsored by the American Jewish Committee that his government had no tolerance for the party’s anti-immigrant intimidation tactics and other fascist behavior. “We are dedicated in completely eradicating such a shame,” he said. “We must do it within the context of our democratic Constitution. But we have to go all the way and do whatever it takes.” His remarks appeared to go beyond previous statements about trying to curb the power of Golden Dawn, which has 18 members in Parliament. Over the weekend, the police arrested six of them, including the party’s leader. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/world/europe/greece-a-vow-to-erase-a-shame.html

Mr. Abbott, who traveled to Indonesia for talks, has come under fire for continuing a policy that ships asylum seekers arriving by boat to third countries for processing and denies them the right to ever settle in Australia. Mr. Abbott’s own plans for combating people smuggling — including forcing boats packed with asylum seekers back into Indonesian waters, buying up boats and gathering intelligence in Indonesian villages — have been heavily criticized by Indonesia. Migrants from the Middle East and South Asia pay smugglers to get them into Indonesia and then onto rickety boats that make the perilous voyage to the Australian territory of Christmas Island, where the migrants can apply for asylum. On Friday, a vessel carrying about 100 people from Lebanon, Pakistan and Iraq sank off West Java, killing at least 36 people.

In the screen test he took at age 10, in 2000, for the first Harry Potter film, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” he smiles brightly, ebullient, his delight in being there apparent; he is concentrating, concentrating so hard at one point that he mouths words under his breath while waiting to deliver a line, but even still, when he does finally speak, he is all natural sincerity. His face is a flawless little-boy face, his eyes huge and cerulean blue. One eye occasionally blinks more slowly than the other, but no matter. He turns, compliantly, this way and that when asked. About four minutes into the footage, someone places the iconic round glasses on him, and there he is: Harry Potter, boy wizard, the chosen one.

To explain this point, I’ll start with a quote from David Frum’s great book “Dead Right,” which was written in the early 1990s, in what seemed like a period of exhaustion and defeat for limited-government conservatism, just before the 1994 congressional sweep gave that movement new political life. Here’s how the Frum of that era — who was much more of a small-government rigorist than he is today — depicted the Reagan years and their implications for the right:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/why-the-right-fights/

In linked but separate civil cases, 13 black and Arab men requested 10,000 euros, about $13,600, in damages from the state after being stopped and in some cases frisked by the police; none of the stops were followed by further police action or charges. The court found that the men had been unable to prove racial motives for the identity checks, which are widely viewed in France as a legitimate policing tactic. A 2009 study conducted by French researchers and the Open Society Justice Initiative found that Arabs and blacks were as much as eight times more likely to be stopped than whites.

Most dancegoers have relatively narrow tastes, but the festival ignores that. Each year, it keeps drawing our attention to things we hadn’t seen, didn’t know, might have missed, new and old; it loves to place dissimilar genres side by side. Its every performance sells out and is lustily cheered; I ardently hope that it leads people to see examples of dance they’ve never visited before.

A story of lives rocked by violence, it has the urgency of a screaming headline but one inscribed with visual lyricism, emotional weight and a belief in individual rights. You can feel the conviction of its director, Jia Zhang-ke — one of the few filmmakers of any nationality who weighs the impact of social and political shifts on people — in every shot. In “A Touch of Sin,” the world isn’t an amorphous backdrop, pretty scenery for private dramas, it is a stage on which men and women struggle to fulfill basic moral obligations, including recognizing one another’s humanity.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/movies/a-touch-of-sin-four-tales-from-china-by-jia-zhang-ke.html

This critically important program is already reeling from the sequester, the senseless across the board budget cuts that began last spring, which caused Head Start centers to scale back on transportation, basic learning materials and, in some cases, to even close their doors. According to the National Head Start Association, owing to the sequester cuts that began in March, 57,000 fewer children will have access to the program this year — with even deeper cuts to come if the mindless process of budget cutting continues.

Freud has lost currency in recent decades, but few in the field of sex research, no matter how they qualify his premise or dismiss him as unscientific, would argue that our early experiences don’t have the power to profoundly shape our later cravings, and two experiments described in Jesse Bering’s “Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us” lend indirect proof.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/books/review/perv-by-jesse-bering.html

Cain set forth a concept he called the “love rack.” For him, it meant finding a way to manipulate readers into caring about his criminal characters and their plight, and surrendering to the story. The term’s connotations of torture were apt. In Cain’s novels, desire is a prison, a death trap. If the author can seduce the audience into investing in that desire, and the fate of the lovers in its thrall, the reader essentially joins them on that rack, with each plot twist proving another pull of the rope, another turn of the screw.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/books/review/elissa-walds-secret-lives-of-married-women.html

Despite defiant assertions of independence like the classic “Cherry Bomb,” the band remains cruelly underrated, a perception Evelyn McDonnell seeks to rectify in her scrupulously researched “Queens of Noise.” Ambition and self-determination are prevailing themes: for these women, pursuing those aims in the 1970s could be brutal, especially when contending with adolescent hormones.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/books/review/queens-of-noise-by-evelyn-mcdonnell.html

What came seeping from around those blockages was a mordant and effervescently graceful disquisition on the nature of poetry, poets, failure and the “interesting blind pain of wrongness”: a riff-tastic essay masquerading as a novel, or vice versa. The voice of Paul Chowder — prickly, whimsical, genially pedagogic, opinion-stippled and often lavishly intelligent — supplied the vessel, yet poetry, the novel’s subject and in some sense its main character, provided the sustenance.

As Andrew O’Hagan points out in his essay, the concept of “fine,” or perhaps “good enough,” has been lost in an age of “awesome” superlatives and extreme travel. In T Magazine’s Fall Travel issue, we discover a more contemplative mode of getting there, and being there, whether the destination is a place or something less defined. Whether with Michael Kimmelman finding Marseille, France, despite a slew of ambitious development projects, as gloriously scrappy as ever, or with the surreal and severe beauty of Craig McDean’s portraits from Iceland’s wilderness, a sense of really being present, a sense of place, is more important than a contrived sense of adventure. We also explore the Restoration Hardware tycoon Gary Friedman’s desire to become a force of disruption in the contemporary art world, a resurgence in appreciation for almost-forgotten Indian Modernist furniture and a family’s attempt to reinvigorate one of Britain’s most famous gardens by restoring its traditional agriculture.

2013-10-07,What’s on Saturday,"9:05 P.M. (Showtime) THE MASTER (2012) Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Lancaster Dodd, the leader of the Cause, a therapeutic, religion-tinged cult built around using painful questions to delve into a subject’s past and get at the root of negative emotion and destructive behavior. Joaquin Phoenix (above left, with Mr. Hoffman) plays Freddie Quell, a World War II Navy veteran and alcoholic wreck who seeks solace through Dodd’s method. And Amy Adams is Peggy Dodd, the latest of her husband’s wives and the hidden hand that guides his empire. “ ‘The Master’ is really more Freddie’s story than Dodd’s, and some of the film’s drama resides in the struggle between the two characters — and perhaps the two actors — for supremacy,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which earned its three principals Oscar nominations. “ ‘You’ll be my protégé and my guinea pig,’ Dodd says to Freddie shortly after their first meeting. There turns out to be a lot more to it than that. They are father and son, guru and disciple, passionate friends and bitter competitors locked in a relationship whose sexual undercurrents are as palpable and mysterious as the motion of water under the surface of the ocean.” The film, he added, “is wild and enormous, its scale almost commensurate with Lancaster Dodd’s hubris and its soul nearly as restless as Freddie Quell’s. It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I’ve seen recently to being a great movie.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

My belief is that the world and our life in it are conditional gifts. We have the world to live in on the condition that we will take good care of it. And to take good care of it we have to know it.

2013-10-07,Economic Reports for the Week Ahead,"E-CIGARETTES The European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, France, plans to vote on Tuesday on a broad set of proposed tobacco regulations — the most contentious of which is how to regulate electronic cigarettes. Advocates of e-cigarettes say they are less harmful than conventional cigarettes, because users inhale nicotine-infused vapors instead of smoke.

2013-10-07,"Sex, Doubt and the Pope","Many liberal Catholics have been encouraged by Pope Francis’s comments about sexual ethics in a recent interview. His general point was that these are lesser matters, not to be emphasized at the expense of the church’s essential message of healing and salvation. Asked about homosexuality, he simply evoked God’s love for all humans: “when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person? . . . In life, God accompanies persons, and we must accompany them, starting from their situation. It is necessary to accompany them with mercy.” More widely, he said: “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods . . . . The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church’s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/sex-doubt-and-the-pope/

It presents Brandon for our titillation, our disapproval and perhaps our envy, but denies him access to our sympathy. I know, that’s the point, that Mr. McQueen wants to show how the intensity of Brandon’s need shuts him off from real intimacy, but this seems to be a foregone conclusion, the result of an elegant experiment that was rigged from the start.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

It’s all about appealing to a wide range of guests. So for the new Hlemmur Square hotel in Reykjavik, he designed a high-low model to accommodate the discerning traveler at any budget. The 26 shared, hostel-style rooms are available for as little as $20 per night, while the 18 private rooms, on a separate, plusher floor, cost as much as $182. A far cry from the standard-issue budget digs of yore, the hostel suites offer duvet-covered beds, complimentary local telephone calls and optional room service. And the upgrade to a private room comes with the usual boutique hotel comforts: modern décor (earth tones and oak parquet floors, gray walls dotted with black-and-white photographs of Old Reykjavik), extra-cozy beds (made with up with Lissadell linens) and stunning, top-floor views (of the city’s boldly colored roofs).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/feeling-for-backpackers-and-businessmen-alike-check-into-hlemmur-square-in-reykjavik/

2013-10-09,The Scent of the Wild in Williamsburg,"A bearded, flannel-shirt-wearing backpacker from the Cascade Mountains of Portland, Ore., is not your typical perfumer. But in the case of Hall Newbegin, an obsessive love for the outdoors inspired him to create Juniper Ridge, a wild-crafted line of handmade colognes, soaps and incense, based in Oakland, Calif. First introduced at farmers’ markets in the Bay Area in 1998 and now carried in thoughtfully curated shops like Shelter Half in Los Angeles and Steven Alan Home in New York, Newbegin’s artisanal goods have a hyper-local focus. He forages aromatic plants, mushrooms, tree trimmings and moss on the trails around the West Coast, then distills everything using an old-fashioned enfleurage process to create essential oils that smell like the Mojave Desert after the rain or a dusky summer evening along the Timberline Trail on Mount Hood. “People say the scents remind them of camping,” said Newbegin, who currently lives by Mount Tamalpais in Northern California and trained in herbal medicine before becoming what he calls a “wildness nose.” The latest additions to his forest-centric range are two addition to his line of “backpacker’s colognes”: Big Sur, which is infused with wild sage, and Yuba River, a blend redolent of cedar log cabins and the richness of hiking-boot leather. Like all Juniper Ridge products, they’re made without petrochemicals or synthetic ingredients — “just real stuff from real places,” Newbegin explained.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/t-magazine/on-beauty-juniper-ridge-fragrances-williamsburg.html

But its roots are actually older. In 2005, Mr. Gutierrez choreographed “Retrospective Exhibitionist,” a piercing solo that explored the plight of a performer with fearlessness, innocence and humor.

Founded in 2008 by Andrés Santo Domingo, Keith Abrahamsson and Tom Clapp as the more tuneful offshoot of their rock-oriented imprint Kemado Records, Mexican Summer has since become a bastion for experimental pop, not to mention a model for successful music publishing in the 21st century. The label, which took its name from a track by the folk singer Marissa Nadler, one of its artists, has enjoyed one success after another. The first LP by the scrappy guitar-pop band Best Coast moved more than 100,000 copies (and subsequently landed in a Windows ad), a sizable number even for a major these days. The garage rocker Kurt Vile, the lo-fi experimental weirdo Ariel Pink and the chillwave act Washed Out have also experienced success with Mexican Summer. A considerable percentage of the label’s sales are on vinyl, according to Abrahamsson.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/happenings-mexican-summer-the-little-indie-label-that-could-throws-an-anniversary-bash/

Bond’s creator also suffered doubts, as any reader of Andrew Lycett’s expansive 1995 biography, “Ian Fleming” (recently republished by St. Martin’s Press), will know. While working on “Moonraker,” the third of his 14 Bond books, Fleming complained that Bond’s future was “nothing but a vista of fantastic adventures on more or less the same pattern, but losing freshness with each volume.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/william-boyds-solo-a-james-bond-novel.html

Mr. Medvedev said that Oleg Ostapenko, a deputy defense minister with long experience in space operations, would be the agency’s new chief.

2013-10-11,Views of the Rebellion,"The slow crackup of China’s last imperial dynasty during its “century of humiliation” was so fantastical it could have been made up by a comic book artist: an aspiring civil servant failed his entrance exam, fell into a delirium, dreamed he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ sent to deliver China from the Qing dynasty and ignited the Taiping Rebellion in 1850. Twenty million people died in the ensuing chaos. In the late 1890s, peasants from the north, affronted by Western influence in the empire, formed a secret society to practice the martial and spiritual disciplines of Chinese folk religion, which some believed made them invulnerable to European bullets and cannon fire. The belief did not survive the test of experience, but did earn the Boxer Rebellion an enduring place in popular memory.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/gene-luen-yangs-boxers-and-saints.html

Be adventurous!” Cecil, hearty and omnivorous, taunts his brother Anton, who would rather doze off to sea chanteys than chase rodents. But when Anton is pressed into service as a mouser on the bark Mary Anne, he’s forced to exert himself as never before. Cecil, hoping to catch up with his brother, stows away aboard another ship and finds he is not always as popular at sea as he was at home.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/anton-and-cecil-by-lisa-martin-and-valerie-martin.html
2013-10-11,The Killer Went Postal,"Jayne Anne Phillips is not sentimental. From her debut story collection, “Black Tickets,” right through to the extraordinary novel “Lark and Termite,” her fiction teems with missed chances and tough luck, and her characters — even the children — are resilient hard cases.

The full answer comes only toward the end of Jonathan Franzen’s engrossing, highly original volume. But that slow burn is part of his purpose. As a declared enemy of the easy response in an instant-access culture, Franzen finds in the unduly neglected Kraus a model of how to provoke readers while at the same time getting them to do some work.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/jonathan-franzens-kraus-project.html

We could bioengineer our main food sources — rice, wheat and corn — in such a way that a single disease could bring about catastrophic famine.

2013-10-11,Peas in a Vintage-Soul-Style Pod,"Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig are not sisters, or even related in any way, but they have been merrily twinned as the frontwomen of the indie band Lucius for nearly a decade. Both 28, they met as students at the Berklee College of Music and then, post-graduation, moved to Brooklyn in 2007 to forge a musical career. “We knew we wanted to work together and sing together and write together,” Ms. Laessig said. “But we were just kind of experimental, and that’s why it took so long to come into what we are now.” After assembling a band through friends and neighbors, their first album as a five-piece, “Wildewoman,” is due Tuesday from Mom + Pop Music. But their act — with Andrew Burri, Peter Lalish and Ms. Wolfe’s husband, Dan Molad, on drums, guitars and bass — has already earned fans for its girl-group harmonies and resourceful rhythms; for their Tiny Desk concert on NPR, they turned an empty cashew container into a drum. They’ve performed with Wilco, and worked as jingle writers and in commercials.

2013-10-14,Britain: Rules for Press Proposed," Britain’s three main political parties on Friday agreed on a plan to regulate the country’s newspapers, but the proposal faced heavy criticism from the press, casting doubt over its future. Because of worries about press freedom, the government wants newspapers to agree voluntarily to be governed by a new regulatory body and whatever rules it sets up, and has suggested some incentives to win their cooperation. The move to tighten regulations follows a phone-hacking scandal that emerged in 2011 and led to the closing of a newspaper in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Under the plan agreed to Friday, the new regulator could impose fines of up to $1.3 million for violations of its code of conduct. Several prominent newspaper groups argue that any regulatory body set up by politicians could be used to control the news media. It is unclear if the parties will now press ahead with their plan or try again to win more media support. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/world/europe/britain-rules-for-press-proposed.html

Of course, he added, “ ‘The Walking Dead’ has become one of the most popular shows on television by consistently getting the balance right.” In “Talking Dead,” at 10, Chris Hardwick, the show’s host, discusses the evening’s “Walking Dead” episode with Nathan Fillion.

2013-10-14,What’s on Monday,"10 P.M. (13) 56 UP (2013) In 1964, the director Michael Apted interviewed 14 British 7-year-olds for a television documentary, returning to film the same children every seven years as they progressed into adulthood. This latest installment finds the subjects, like Tony, left, settling into middle age. “As in the earlier movies, Mr. Apted again folds in older material from the ages of 7, 14 and so on, to set the scene and jog memories,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “The abrupt juxtapositions of epochs can be jarring, unnerving or touching — sometimes all three — as bright-faced children bloom and sometimes fade within seconds. An analogous project in print or even still photographs wouldn’t be as powerful, because what gives the ‘Up’ series its punch is not so much its longevity or the human spectacle it offers, but that these are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space. The more you watch, the more the movies transform from mirrors into memory machines, ones that inevitably summon reflections of your own life.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

But Dolly’s birth, and the rush of media attention that followed when the news broke in 1997, gave way almost instantaneously to fears and speculation about what this discovery meant for humanity’s ability to manipulate biology. The debate only intensified in 1998, when an American scientist isolated human embryonic stem cells, which can develop into any type of cell in the body, raising the hope of a new field of regenerative medicine.

The explosion took place Sunday afternoon as thousands were gathering in the capital, Addis Ababa, to watch a World Cup qualifying soccer game between Ethiopia and Nigeria. Security officials found grenades, a revolver and explosives at the scene, Mr. Redwan said. He characterized it as a terrorist plot but said it was not yet clear who was behind it. The Shabab militant group, which claimed responsibility for last month’s attack on a Kenyan shopping mall, carried out a pair of bombings in Uganda during the broadcast of the World Cup final in 2010. Like Kenya and Uganda, Ethiopia has troops in Somalia. The two men killed in Sunday’s blast were in the country illegally, Mr. Redwan said. He said that the attackers had apparently intended to strike multiple targets but that the bombs had detonated unexpectedly before the men could execute their plan.

The man, Ji Zhongxing, had been trying to draw attention to his allegations that officials in Dongguan, an industrial city in far southern China, ignored his complaints that security officers there beat him so severely in 2005 that he was unable to walk and had to use a wheelchair. The blast badly injured Mr. Ji and slightly wounded a police officer. The case kindled widespread debate in China, with some Internet users voicing sympathy for Mr. Ji and his ire with government officials. Dongguan officials said they had given him compensation of 100,000 renminbi, or about $16,400, on condition that he drop his complaints. Mr. Ji pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers argued that he had not meant to detonate the explosive, the China News Service reported. The maximum sentence for the charge was 10 years in prison.

2013-10-17,The Challenge of Diabetes for Doctor and Patient,"My patient was miserable — parched with thirst, exhausted and jumping up to go to the bathroom every few minutes. His vision was blurry and he’d been losing weight the last few weeks, despite eating voraciously. I’d only just met him, but I was able to diagnose diabetes in about a minute. What was unusual was that this was a scheduled office visit; usually, patients with such overwhelming symptoms are the provenance of emergency departments and urgent care centers.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/the-challenge-of-diabetes-for-doctor-and-patient/
2013-10-17,Was It All Boehner’s Fault?,"As a follow-up to my post on the lessons of the shutdown, and my insistence on the essentially indefensible folly of what we’ve just witnessed from House Republicans, let me say something about the alternative interpretation that’s come up in a number of mini-debates I’ve had on Twitter over the last week or so, with conservative writers like the Weekly Standard’s Jay Cost and Sean Davis of the nascent webzine The Federalist. Against my indictment of the Republican caucus as a whole, they’ve basically argued that the seeming irrationality of G.O.P. strategy across the last few weeks mostly just reflects the mistakes, shading into incompetence, of John Boehner’s negotiating strategy, rather the kind of deeper, essentially methodless dysfunction that I see when I look at the House Republicans. At bottom, these interlocutors think that the House Republicans are a fairly normal majority with a serious leadership problem, and they think I’m a victim of what you might call the pundit’s limited-horizon problem, which fails to work in vitally-useful knowledge — political science research in Cost’s case, business-school theory in Davis’s case — that would pin more of the responsibility on Boehner, and less on his backbenchers. (You can also read a more personalized version of this argument here, from the pseudonymous blogger Thomas Crown, which is based on a slight misreading of a tweet I wrote to Davis — such are the perils of Twitter! — but which works off the entirely correct assumption that my analysis of internal House dynamics lacks the benefit of sustained personal experience with high-stakes negotiations in politics, law or the business world.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/was-it-all-boehners-fault/

The line, recently rebranded as Clare V., is polished enough for a party, but not too precious for the subway — auxiliary pouches and pockets cleverly accommodate gadgets or spare pairs of shoes. “New York is full of working women who want to look chic while being prepared for all sorts of situations,” Vivier said. Those women can now find the entire Clare V. range at the brand’s second boutique and first East Coast outpost, which opens tonight in a former dressmaker’s shop on Elizabeth Street in NoLIta. Walking into the space feels like being transported to California, thanks to its airy, light-flooded interior (by the L.A.-based architect Barbara Bestor, who also designed Vivier’s Silver Lake flagship) and its mostly SoCal-sourced lifestyle goods (jewelry by Annie Costello Brown, hats by Westbrook Maker, scented candles from the Chateau Marmont).

The Saudis, who support the rebellion seeking the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, have criticized the Council over what they regard as its insufficient response to the turmoil in the Middle East. Last month the Saudi foreign minister canceled his General Assembly speech, apparently to show the Saudis’ displeasure.

They do play what could loosely be called rock songs; Matt Johnson, the keyboardist, sometimes shrieks phrases that are probably English words, though they go through so much reverb and echo there’s rarely a chance of deciphering them. But Hookworms also spent part of their set, and their debut album “Pearl Mystic,” creating and sustaining noises that are deliberately amorphous: no beat, just resonance and distortion.

2013-10-18,The Jean-Georges Kitchen From on High,"While designing the kitchen at his namesake restaurant on Columbus Circle, Jean-Georges Vongerichten traded American efficiency for Old World tyranny. The five food stations, staffed by six cooks (two on fish) and one floating chef (a chef de tournant) are arranged perpendicular to the pass, which is where the food is handed off to the food runners (seen at the bottom of the page), all under the scrutiny of another chef, who runs the line. Typically, Vongerichten says, “you cook against the wall, turn around, plate it and it goes out.” At Jean-Georges, the staff members cook various elements at their stations and then walk them up to the pass — where they assemble the dishes with monastic precision. When your shrimp appetizer, being plated lower left by two cooks, comes with crispy baby artichokes, crispy mushrooms, smoked paprika gel, lemon fennel purée, microthyme and parsley, a more collaborative and focused effort is required.

There is little doubt that most (if not all) the clients who use the food cupboard can little afford proper dental care. I believe such behavior is thoughtless, unethical and unprofessional. I am a retired dentist. BILL BOWEN, ROCHESTER",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/annual-cavity-drive.html

Parker invented the 100-point rating system for wine, and his reviews wielded such influence over sales that vintners everywhere worked to please Parker’s palate, making oaky, intensely flavored, high-alcohol wines. Kermit Lynch, meanwhile, through his wine shop in Berkeley, Calif., and also through his nationwide distribution business, chose to sell only French and Italian wines made in the unadulterated, old-school traditional style aimed at accentuating terroir — each vineyard’s unique combination of weather, soil and geography.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/kermit-lynch-terroirist.html

Amateur literary critics, like Dylan Lucia, an Amazon reviewer who gave one star to “Fahrenheit 451” (“Bradbury is a good writer [I’ll give him that], but I HATE his writing style”), may lack a nuanced understanding of the English language; some amateur film critics, like the IMDB reviewer who gave 10 stars to “Wrath of the Titans” (“i never saw a movie this good before in my life”), may have never seen another movie before in their lives. But all of us with a tongue and a functioning digestive tract are authorities on food.

But it is known that the ancient Greeks cultivated leafy greens, which they boiled and ate as a cure for drunkenness. And early Roman manuscripts include references to “brassica,” a word that encompassed wild turnips, cabbages and kalelike plants. By the Middle Ages, kale had spread through Europe and Asia. The Italians developed plants with “dinosaur” scales, while the Scots created varietals with leaves like frilly petticoats. The Russians produced kale that could survive in the snow. But by the time Tim Peters, who was then farming in Oregon, began experimenting with the plant in the 1980s, kale had become “boring.” “You only saw the green kind in the supermarket,” he says, “if you could find it at all.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/who-made-that-kale.html

2013-10-18,Inside the List,"11/22/63: As the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination approaches, Americans remain divided on the big question: Who did it? According to an Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in April, 59 percent of the country believes in a conspiracy, while 24 percent accepts the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Another 16 percent isn’t sure. (Yes, that adds up to 99 percent. The rest probably blames President Obama.) The best-seller list reflects this split personality. “Killing Kennedy,” by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard, echoes the Warren Report’s lone gunman thesis and has spent 34 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list; it’s currently on the extended list at No. 22. Meanwhile, a new case for conspiracy hits the nonfiction ­list at No. 14: “They Killed Our President,” by the renowned historian and investigative journalist Jesse (the Body) Ventura, who with Dick Russell and David Wayne argues the president was killed by “disgruntled C.I.A. agents, anti-Castro Cubans and members of the Mafia. . . . Members of the U.S. military were also involved.” Like the former professional wrestler he is, Ventura confronts his biggest rival head on. “Since Bill O’Reilly apparently thinks he knows so much about the J.F.K. assassination,” he writes, “I’d like to publicly challenge him. . . .

Let’s admit that the prose is a bit flat, and the characters lack nuance, the unavoidable consequence of withholding key information about persons and motives until those last (first!) five chapters give it all up.

2013-10-21,T Fall Design Issue,"In our latest issue, we explore distinct forms of design, whether they’re found in the asymmetrical forms of fashion, or in the ’70s-style curvilinear lines of furniture, or in the architecture of midcentury homes in the Beverly Hills neighborhood of Trousdale. Design, like all forms of art, can be very personal; members of one of England’s most celebrated families, Emma, Issy and Stella Tennant, draw inspiration from nature, namely from the bucolic surroundings in Scotland to create their sculptures and paintings. It can also be very pared down and minimal, like in the home of two fashion designers in Tokyo, or in the distilled, spacious Antwerp residence of the Belgian architect Vincent Van Duysen. On a larger scale, we discover designers and artisans determined to reinvent neighborhoods and cities around the world. In Sydney’s Rosebery neighborhood, three businesses celebrate the best of the city’s agriculture, craftsmanship and furniture design. Meanwhile, in Belgrade, locals are turning their city into a world-class destination, with the emergence of design hotels, art museums and adventurous restaurants. We embrace those who break with convention in art and design; Not Vital, a Swiss artist obsessed with habitats, is the Picasso, the Dali, the Andy Warhol of today, claims Andrew O’Hagan. Howard Slatkin’s Fifth Avenue apartment is filled with custom-made items, from floor to ceiling; each room has a combination of textiles, lighting, objets d’art from different eras and countries. Last but not least, we celebrate visionaries who are using technology to take design — and our imaginations — to the next level.

Then a grotesque figure the girls call Mama appears in the shadows and begins to wreak havoc on their lives. But is the monster simply a coping mechanism for dealing with tragedy? Or is Mama the essence of the girls’ dead mother? “Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while the director, Guillermo del Toro, “the reigning godfather of motion picture horror,” took only an executive producing credit on the film, “it fits with the more successful movies he’s signed onto. Mr. del Toro understands that nothing says terror like a home that’s become a rattling cage.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Since no one would know in advance where in society they would end up, rational agents would select a society in which everyone was guaranteed basic rights, including equality of opportunity. Since genuine (rather than “on paper”) equality of opportunity requires substantial access to resources — shelter, medical care, education — Rawls’s rational actors would also make their society a redistributive one, ensuring a decent standard of life for everyone.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/questions-for-free-market-moralists/

The new musical “After Midnight,” a revue recreating the Cotton Club nightclub scene, also had a good first week, grossing $235,823 for three previews (or 64 percent of the maximum possible amount). Over all, Broadway musicals and plays grossed $24 million last week, compared to $24.6 million the previous week, which fell over the Columbus Day holiday weekend.

The deep-sea field, called Libra, is believed to be one of Brazil’s most promising exploration areas. Legislation requires the Brazilian company to take control of the new operation, but doubts persist among energy analysts as to whether Petrobras, which has soaring debt and is trying to reverse a decline in Brazil’s oil production, is overstretched with an array of offshore projects. The auction was carried out in Rio de Janeiro amid protests by oil workers and other groups that oppose the participation of foreign companies in Brazil’s oil industry.

2013-10-23,Why Not Medicaid For All?,"My Sunday column on the potential consequences of Obamacare’s botched rollout ended by sketching a scenario in which the program’s Medicaid expansion is deemed a success while its reform of the individual market leads to much-higher-than-expected costs and much-lower-than-expected participation rates. This combination would no doubt be politically helpful to the Republican Party in the short run, but (I argued) it would actually leave liberals with a fairly clear path forward: Keep pressing the Medicaid expansion on states that haven’t taken it (and look for John Kasich-style Republicans to partner with), return to the Joe Lieberman-killed idea of expanding Medicare to 55-and-overs, and basically try to further shrink the percentage of Americans who aren’t eligible for one or both of those single-payer programs. This wouldn’t amount to the full-on push for single payer that some people expect from the left if Obamacare fails or gets repealed, but it would move the U.S. toward the closest thing to single payer that we’re ever likely to get: A system in which both the late middle-aged and the lower middle class gradually get folded into government-run insurance alongside the poor, the disabled, and the aged; the individual market survives as a kind of de facto high risk pool (overpriced but technically accessible); and the employer mandate helps prop up employer-based health insurance for a shrunken but still substantial share of the population.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/why-not-medicaid-for-all/

Below are portraits by Marvin Orellana of some of the people who have served Balthazar the longest, behind the scenes.

Its roots as a blue-collar town — as the German Athens, as Brew City — are still evident in the names of local landmarks (Pabst Theater, Pfister Hotel, Miller Park, where the Milwaukee Brewers play); the neatly demarcated enclaves that still retain strong traces of their ethnic origins; the countless cozy neighborhood taps; and the locals’ love of sausage, cheese and beer, not to mention the array of festivals (German Fest, Irish Fest, Polish Fest) that overtake the lakefront every summer. Yet this city — Wisconsin’s largest, population 600,000 — is hardly a backward-looking place. Following a few decades of diminishing population, numbers have risen slightly in the years since the 2010 census, much of the increase due to young people moving into a few revived downtown neighborhoods like Walker’s Point and the southerly, suddenly hip Bay View, with its bars and galleries.

A gleaming, complicated assemblage of gilt bronze, it has a neo-classical base from which columns resembling minarets made of basket-woven metal bands rise. These flank a roughly pyramidal tower of eight different clocks with enameled faces keeping time according to as many different systems. At the summit a little figure of Victory blows a trumpet.

In most ways it resembles the hundreds of other desolate reefs, islands, rock clusters and cays that collectively are called the Spratly Islands. But Ayungin is different. It sits on the southwestern edge of Reed Bank, an area rumored to contain vast reserves of oil and natural gas. And its shallows are home to a World War II-era ship called the Sierra Madre, which the Philippine government ran aground on the reef in 1999 and has since maintained as a kind of post-apocalyptic military garrison, manned by eight Filipino troops struggling to survive extreme mental and physical desolation. Of all places, the scorched shell of the Sierra Madre has become an unlikely battleground in a geopolitical struggle that will shape the future of the South China Sea and, to some extent, the rest of the world.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/a-game-of-shark-and-minnow.html

The case, one of the most notorious recent child-abduction cases in Europe, was formally closed in 2008. But after a campaign by the girl’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, British and Portuguese investigators began reviewing the evidence two years ago and independently uncovered new leads. In July, British officials opened a formal investigation, and now Portugal has followed suit. Portuguese investigators did not specify what the new leads were, but according to the police in London they are separate from the ones being followed in Britain. Teams from both countries met a week ago to compare notes and to brief the McCanns on the progress. Madeleine disappeared on May 3, 2007, from an apartment in a resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal, while her parents were having dinner at a nearby restaurant.

Next month, he opens his House of Waris Rare shop inside the library of Venice’s lavish Gritti Palace hotel. “I’m not just interested in well-designed trophies,” he says. “Whatever we stock should serve an actual purpose.” He steers away from comparisons to Paris’s Deyrolle or any upscale curiosity boutique, talking instead about revisiting ancient trade routes. In some ways this project is the culmination of a three-year expedition he began with the Luxury Collection, which owns the hotel and commissioned Ahluwalia as its global explorer. Everything sold at the shop — engraved tumblers hand-blown in Murano, vintage Fortuny fabrics fashioned into stuffed animals — is the type of affectionate object one might imagine, say, Ernest Hemingway gifting his mistress. Ahluwalia has stocked the shop with unique goods from artisans both emerging and established, including his own fine jewelry. “You can’t just ogle and awe,” he says about these collectibles. “You must engage as a patron. It’s not just the items that are unique — so too are the people who make them.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/in-store-waris-ahluwalia-opens-an-old-world-market-in-venice/

When you’re reading the script, it’s like there’s a series of cogs in a very clever clock. The cogs start to engage and — a good word is dread. And the dread sets in, and it stays there.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/ridley-scott-most-novelists-are-desperate-to-do-what-i-do.html

2013-10-25,The Harvard Doctor Who Accidentally Unleashed a Zombie Invasion,"Roughly two years ago, one of the most popular radio programs in America finally alerted the country to the coming zombie apocalypse. The weekend host of the radio program, Ian Punnett, was interviewing me, a Harvard Medical School physician and national expert on the compelling world of zombie neuroscience. Punnett asked me to help make sense of a new and terrifying threat to our planet, and I told him what I had learned from a discovered manuscript penned by a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had succumbed to a zombie plague while studying its origins. The newly uncovered disease was called Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome (A.N.S.D.), I explained, and the C.D.C. expert worried that the disease had been engineered by nefarious hedge-fund managers, in hopes that the stock market would plunge and become vulnerable to manipulations as the chaos spread.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/the-harvard-doctor-who-accidentally-unleashed-a-zombie-invasion.html
2013-10-25,Who Made That Coffee Lid?,"In the late 1970s, when you ordered coffee to go, you usually had to tear a hole in the plastic lid if you wanted to drink through it. This maneuver was so awkward that you risked burning your hand. So in the 1980s, a number of food-packaging engineers tried to fix the problem. William and Kenneth Dart, of the Dart Container Corporation, created one of the first of a new breed of coffee-cup lids, filing a patent in 1981 for a plastic disc with a press-down tab that acted like a valve. The inventors called this feature a “lip-engaging buttress”; you pushed on it with your upper lip to release a gulp of coffee. Once you finished drinking, the tab snapped back into place to prevent spills. (Kenneth Dart, who made a fortune in this and other business ventures, later renounced his citizenship and moved to Belize, where he was exempt from U.S. taxes.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/who-made-that-coffee-lid.html

However I feel that in our diverse, modern world, it is less than ideal. By assuming other people should be treated the way I want to be treated, it imposes my preferences and values on those around me.

He walked unsteadily a few feet in my direction at first, clutching a bunch of bananas to his broad chest.

It is a lovely derrière, no question, round, compact and firm, and I became well acquainted with how it looked whether tucked into snug jeans or perched prettily in the air when Adèle, who’s 15 when the movie opens, lies splayed sleeping face down in bed, as young children often do.

Kennedy,” to be published on Tuesday, includes correspondence to and from Harry Truman, Winston Churchill and Nikita Khrushchev, about nuclear weapons, the Cuban missile crisis and other momentous subjects. It also contains responses like the one Kennedy wrote to a young girl in 1961, which begins, “I was glad to get your letter about trying to stop the Russians from bombing the North Pole and risking the life of Santa Claus.” Martin W. Sandler, the book’s editor, estimates that two million letters came in and out of the White House during Kennedy’s presidency. “Of course I didn’t read two million letters,” he told me in a telephone interview, “but I went blind reading a hell of a lot of them.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/books/review/dear-mr-president.html

Stanton, a 29-year-old Georgia native, started photographing strangers in 2010 after finding his way to New York from Chicago, where he had recently lost his job as a bond trader. “My mom basically thought this was my glorified way of not working,” he told ABC’s “Nightline” last month. “Like, oh, Brandon’s in New York taking pictures of people on the street and putting them on Facebook, you know what I mean?” That description isn’t far off the mark, actually. But it misses the primal voyeuristic appeal of Stanton’s blog, which only increased after he started interviewing his subjects and including short quotations or anecdotes with their portraits. (“Q.

The book is full of players and posers, among them a widow who writes to the newspapers in her dead husband’s name and mourners who “performed their sadness flamboyantly, pushing the very limits of realism.” Even the elusive narrator, a magazine writer, is playacting, pursuing a story that is unlikely ever to see print.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/books/review/daniel-alarcons-at-night-we-walk-in-circles.html

The travel writer should be knowledgeable but not an expert, open in mind and body to the unforeseen twists of serendipity. But what we most require from travel writing, as opposed to mere guidebooks, is that elusive quality Nick Carraway defined as “romantic readiness.” Few 20th-century figures combined these traits in a more appealing package than the English writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, Paddy to his many friends, who died in 2011 at the age of 96. One of these was Diana Cooper, a famous beauty who turned up in the fiction of Evelyn Waugh. Now Artemis Cooper, her granddaughter, has written an affectionately intimate, informative and forgiving biography of Diana’s complicated friend.

2013-10-25,Her Dynasty,"For historians, there is no more powerful aphrodisiac than an exciting topic buoyed by a raft of unexploited sources, raising the prospect of a revisionist look at an important figure or even an entire era. There are few leaders in modern Chinese history more layered with prejudice begging to be stripped away than Cixi, the dowager empress who ruled China for almost half a century until her death in 1908. For decades, she was condescendingly referred to in the West as “the Old Buddha,” the “She Dragon,” the usurper of a throne “over whose disintegration she presided.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/books/review/jung-changs-empress-dowager-cixi.html

Eliza — totally alone in the world, her sole companions the protagonists of Dickens, her recent dreams filled with “dark graveyards and irregular vistas” — seems primed for a richly horrifying experience. Arriving soaked to the bone and in the dead of night, the new governess of Gaudlin finds not the greeting of a warm fire and a noble family at its ease, but two eerily well-mannered children alone in an otherwise empty house.

2013-10-25,The Reawakening,"Just give in — I finally did — to the rough-edged charms of Sara Wheeler’s latest hybrid of historical narrative and travelogue. Never mind that Wheeler, a British author whose previous book, “Terra Incognita,” chronicled her adventures in Antarctica, commits the same sin as at least two of the six women writers she profiles: Fanny Trollope, whose withering account of life along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, “Domestic Manners of the Americans,” infuriated American readers; and Fanny Kemble Butler, whose reflexively judgmental “Journal of a Residence in America” provoked a breach with her American husband. Wheeler seems not to have calculated the effects of her own gratuitous insults, whether aimed at the “agreeable Fatty­towns” of the Midwest or the “crap of contemporary America” she encounters at a once-grand seaside resort community in Massachusetts. Even her praise can be faintly damning: “On the whole Americans are a friendly, polite lot.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/books/review/sara-wheelers-o-my-america.html

Everything on the page is the result of a series of strenuous choices, none inevitable, and reminding the reader just who made these choices (whether conscious or not) can be amusing, aesthetically useful and a great relief from the constraints of the traditional conventions of fiction. But intelligent readers may not need reminding, may even take it as an insult. They know who the puppets are and who the puppeteer.

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that perhaps the film’s achievement “should be quantified rather than judged in more conventional, qualitative ways. This is by no means the best movie of the year, but it may be the most movie you can get for the price of a single ticket.” Its six sections also star Doona Bae, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving and Ben Whishaw. “Together the filmmakers try so hard to give you everything — the secrets of the universe and the human heart; action, laughs and romance; tragedy and mystery — that you may wind up feeling both grateful and disappointed.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The men filmed the proceedings — from pitches to billionaires and studio moguls to encounters with movie stars and directors — then turned it into a cinematic romp about Hollywood deal making. “ ‘Seduced and Abandoned,’ which uses split screens much of the time, rambles entertainingly from topic to topic,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “It begins with a complaint ascribed to Orson Welles that he spent 95 percent of his life running around trying to raise money for movies and 5 percent making them.

Despite the “Not for sale to minors” disclaimer on its cover, Prickett isn’t shy about hoping the young and curious find it, even if they have to steal it. “I want to go on the record as being very pro-minors,” she said. “I love teen girls. I wish I could have been one — I was awful at it. The best I can hope for is the feeling I had as a teen, which is that I couldn’t wait to get older. I want people to feel like that until they’re 70.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/bookshelf-an-erotic-magazine-for-voyeurs-and-literati-alike/

One online commenter, responding to Amanda Fortini’s article in this past weekend’s magazine, wondered how Hemingway could afford her lifestyle, which includes a home in Malibu on a 1.5-acre ranch with organic vegetable beds, a climbing wall and at least one horse: “The math doesn’t add up. She hasn’t had a real film career in thirty years.” In fact, she has appeared in quite a few films and TV shows, including one of the ”Superman” sequels and an episode of the sitcom “Roseanne.” Here are some of the highlights.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/mariel-hemingway-beyond-manhattan/

2013-10-30,Morocco in a Bottle,"Pure argan oil, responsibly sourced from Morocco, is the key ingredient in all of the products made by the New York organic skin care line Kahina Giving Beauty, founded five years ago by Katharine L’Heureux. The brand’s signature product, a bottle of 100 percent organic argan oil, works as well on the face and body as it does on hair, soothing dryness and replenishing moisture. But for Kahina’s first body serum, L’Heureux combined a lightweight argan oil base with 16 other oils, from watermelon and coconut to cumin and clove, to “create this more luxurious spreadable texture,” she said. It’s also the brand’s first scented product. The aroma is called Fez. Putting it on is a warm, sensory experience meant to transport the wearer to the Moroccan city, one of L’Heureux’s favorite places. “I wanted something evocative of that multilayered city that combines spirituality with all the scents of the spice market and the souk and the floral notes that happen in the spring, when the orange flower blossoms are just spilling through the streets,” L’Heureux explained. “I’ve never personally been a big scent person, but I love the idea of evoking places.” She plans to introduce additional products with the same spicy scent. $98; givingbeauty.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/t-magazine/kahina-giving-beauty-body-serum.html

2013-10-30,What’s on Wednesday,"1:15 A.M. (TCM) THE CONVERSATION (1974) Gene Hackman, above, plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert and paranoid loner who has been hired to eavesdrop on a married woman (Cindy Williams) and her lover (Frederic Forrest) by her suspicious husband, known as the Director (Robert Duvall). (A young Harrison Ford portrays the Director’s assistant.) But three people have already died because of Harry’s work, and now he’s worried that two more may soon lose their lives. The movie, written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, received three Oscar nominations, including for best picture and best original screenplay. In the same awards season, his film “The Godfather: Part II” won for best director, best picture and best adapted screenplay. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called “The Conversation” haunting and bothersome: “Haunting because its suggestion that technology has gotten out of hand, though not exactly new, is so convincingly and fastidiously detailed. It’s bothersome because Mr. Coppola, the writer as well as the director, has nearly succeeded in making a great film but has, instead, made one that is merely very good.” Worth a listen: David Shire’s evocative score for solo piano.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Another soldier is under investigation. The Westgate mall was attacked by militants claiming to be from the Shabab, an Islamic extremist group in Somalia, on Sept. 21. Security forces spent four days securing the mall. Shop owners said that myriad merchandise was looted from the mall between the day of the attack and when shop owners were allowed back, one week later.

Most discussions focused on two aspects: The high percentage of interfaith marriages and the vast support among American Jews for Israel.Fifty-eight percent of Jews who married between 2005 and 2013 have a non-Jewish spouse. Mixed marriages inevitably lead to the assimilation of Jews into American culture, and tap long-standing Israeli fears over the future of the Jewish people.

The inquiry began last month, after the killing of an anti-fascist singer by a self-professed supporter of Golden Dawn. The killing was the culmination of a string of assaults attributed to members or supporters of the fiercely anti-immigrant party, which has 18 seats in Greece’s 300-member Parliament. Out of 319 police officers questioned, 15 were arrested on various charges, including illegal weapons possession and trading in contraband goods, and of those, 10 were found to have “direct or indirect involvement with the criminal activities of Golden Dawn,” according to the head of the police’s internal affairs unit, Panagiotis Stathis. The investigation found no “organized cells, factions or unconstitutional hubs” but highlighted “inadequate supervision” within the force, he added at a news conference. The 15 officers who were arrested were suspended pending the outcome of their cases, a police spokesman said.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/world/europe/greek-police-say-10-officers-have-links-to-golden-dawn.html

The debut issue is a glossy, minimalist affair that feels rather like an exhibition catalog, except for the heartfelt introductory letter from Friedman. (Fans of Restoration Hardware’s “source books” will recognize his favored sign-off — “Carpe Diem, Gary.”) Both ventures are part of RH Contemporary Art, a platform that also includes documentaries, artist residencies and a web emporium, all aimed at selling creations by the artists it works with (who currently number about 50).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/art-market-restoration-hardwares-next-move-a-quarterly-journal-for-art-lovers/

Priming occurs when a seemingly trivial alteration in an experimental situation produces major changes in the behavior of the subjects.,Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/psyching-us-out/

2013-11-01,Old Hatreds Just Won’t Stay Buried,"Virulent ethnic hatred doesn’t die; it lies dormant until it is suddenly prodded awake, at which point it can flare into a consuming wildfire. That is the ugly message of the Polish filmmaker Wladyslaw Pasikowski’s lurid “Aftermath,” which delivers its Holocaust-related story with the clunking force of a blunt instrument slammed into the skull.

2013-11-01,A Spicy Outlier of Pink Grapes,"From a distance, the five bottles arrayed on my kitchen counter for a recent tasting — tall, with slender necks — looked Alsatian, but they were not. All contained dry Long Island gewürztraminers, which, broadly speaking, trace their style to Alsace, in northeastern France.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/nyregion/gewurztraminers-in-the-east-end.html
2013-11-01,A Writer Who’s Beat in Search of a Refuge,"“Big Sur” cracks the code of how to adapt Jack Kerouac for the screen. The secret is deceptively simple: Go to the source and stay there. The hot-wired energy and spontaneity of the Beat mystique are embedded in writing that distills its feverish essence better than any hyped-up action. The hard part is melding readings with live action, but “Big Sur” makes it look so easy that you hardly notice the transitions.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/movies/kerouac-novel-adapted-to-screen-in-big-sur.html

2013-11-01,"In Sin City, Men Will, Predictably, Be Boys","If you crossed “The Hangover” with “The Bucket List,” you might wind up with something like “Last Vegas.” For all I know, that may have been the exact pitch that brought a green light to this almost defiantly pointless film, competently directed by Jon Turteltaub. A mild geezer comedy full of jokes that might have sounded tired at a “Dean Martin Celebrity Roast,” the movie has no reason for existence and nothing much to recommend it.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/movies/last-vegas-stars-de-niro-freeman-douglas-and-kline.html

2013-11-01,Tattoos and Bluegrass Music in the Wilds of Belgium,"Much like the tattoos etched on the beautiful body of one character and the beard sprouting on the face of another, the narrative two-step performed in “The Broken Circle Breakdown” goes a long way toward distracting you from the familiarity of the story. The ink adorns Elise (Veerle Baetens), a tattoo artist, who lives with her bearded partner, Didier (Johan Heldenbergh), a bluegrass musician, and their young daughter, Maybelle (Nell Cattrysse), in the kind of picturesque country spread where a dog chases chickens that roost in a pickup truck. It looks like a slice of hillbilly heaven, except that this isn’t Kentucky but a pastoral corner near the Flemish city of Ghent in Belgium.

2013-11-01,F.D.A. Lays Out Rule to Avoid Drug Shortages,"The Food and Drug Administration detailed a plan on Thursday to prevent drug shortages. It fleshes out changes in a 2012 law that requires makers of important prescription drugs to notify the agency of interruptions in production that might disrupt supply. The rule, which is open to public comment for 60 days, applies for the first time to makers of “biological medicines,” which are produced in microorganisms, animal or plant cells. The agency said the number of new shortages fell to 117 last year, down from 251 in 2011. ",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/health/fda-lays-out-rule-to-avoid-drug-shortages.html
2013-11-01,The Private Heartaches of a People’s Princess,"Naomi Watts is one of those performers who seemingly can do no wrong, even in a waxworks like “Diana.” A slice of biographical conjecture about the Princess of Wales, this movie isn’t especially good, but it wins you over a little just because it succeeds where truckloads of sanctifying reminiscences have failed: Anchored by Ms. Watts’s sympathetic performance, it humanizes the woman behind the smile, the helmet hair and the myth. Part reheated gossip, part moony romance, it revisits an affair Diana had with a Pakistani heart surgeon, Hasnat Khan, a liaison she managed to keep from the ravenous media maw that she routinely fed and spectacularly failed to control.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/movies/naomi-watts-stars-in-diana.html
2013-11-01,More Yang Than Yin? Better Fix Your Life Force,"The fight is the thing in “Man of Tai Chi,” Keanu Reeves’s down-and-dirty and generally diverting directing debut. A story about the past and the future, the good and the bad, the strong and the weak, the movie finds a Januslike Mr. Reeves looking in two directions at once: toward the old-school kung fu movies of once upon a matinee time and the modern China emblemized by the high rises that slice through smog-swathed Beijing, where most of the story unwinds. It’s there that Tiger (Tiger Chen) logs hours between lessons with a tai chi master, Yang (Yu Hai).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/movies/man-of-tai-chi-directed-by-keanu-reeves.html
2013-11-01,Malaria in United States Is at a 40-Year High," Malaria cases in the United States have reached a 40-year high, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday, but virtually all were in travelers who were infected overseas. Of the 1,925 cases detected in 2011, almost 70 percent were in people who had visited Africa, particularly West Africa. Most others were from India. Five ended in death. Cases peaked in January and August after the Christmas and summer travel seasons. Only five cases occurred in the United States, said Dr. Paul M. Arguin, the agency’s chief of domestic malaria. One was a lab accident, another was from a blood transfusion, two were in babies born to mothers who had traveled and one occurred in winter in a patient whose travel history might not have been fully disclosed.

2013-11-01,Drop in LSAT Takers Shows Legal Field’s Slump," Once again, fewer candidates are taking the Law School Admission Test, a sign that students recognize the continuing slump in the legal field. The latest figures released this week by the Law School Admissions Council show that nearly 11 percent fewer people took the LSAT in October than the year before. The Wall Street Journal’s Law Blog calculated that this October’s 33,673 test takers represent a drop of 45 percent since the test-taking peak in 2009. Daniel M. Filler, a professor at the Earle Mack School of Law at Drexel University, blogged that some schools might see applications decline to the point that they could have to “radically restructure” to make ends meet.
