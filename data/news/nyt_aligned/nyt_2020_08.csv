Surrounded by promenades with views across the East River to Brooklyn, its rooftop, open year-round, has a collection of cabana-like pods set on patches of faux lawn for dining and drinking throughout the day. There are 28 of them, each accommodating up to eight people, to be reserved in advance. They’re equipped with umbrellas, lounge chairs, coolers and USB ports, and you can order from your smartphone. The pods require reservations; two other areas, a north patio and south patio, are first-come, first-served. The menu for the entire rooftop consists of fruity cocktails, some of them slushy, and food like fish and chips, organic chicken sandwiches, and salmon and squash kebabs. On the pier’s ground level, one restaurant, Malibu Farm, will open for outdoor dining on Thursday. The Fulton by Jean-Georges Vongerichten is opening soon, along with David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar, moving into the Bar Wayo space. Another restaurant on the pier, Carne Mare from Andrew Carmellini, which was supposed to make its debut in April, has yet to announce an opening date.

The Al Capone of this film is not the iconic bootlegger and crime boss that audiences are likely familiar with. He’s just spent 11 years in federal prison for tax evasion, and neurosyphilis is claiming his mind. As portrayed by Tom Hardy, Capone is “a boogeyman bloated with body fluids,” according to Ben Kenigsberg’s review for The Times. During this twilight period, the retired gangster lives in Palm Island, Fla., in the care of his wife, Mae (Linda Cardellini), and a doctor played by Kyle MacLachlan. Still under surveillance by law enforcement and haunted by the crimes he committed as a younger man, Capone struggles to recall where he hid millions of dollars before he was imprisoned.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-capone-and-the-titan-games.html

She and her nine cooks were getting used to working with masks on, but were they allowed to act the way they normally did, she wondered, like some amalgamation of an athletic team and a family? And how could they translate a restaurant built to feel like a laid-back afternoon hangout into an experience people could take home in disposable containers?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/daniela-soto-innes-cooking-chef.html
2020-08-10,The British Designer Paying Tribute to the Immigrant Experience,"In 1990s South London, a young Priya Ahluwalia would watch as members of her extended family got ready for garage raves, styling themselves in matching two-piece sets, dresses with chain belts and patterned silk shirts. “All the guys wore earrings,” she recalls. “I used to wish I could go party with them, too.” Perhaps her longing helped crystallize these memories, because similar pieces, such as candy-hued sweater vests, vividly patchworked hoodies and jackets made from deconstructed Levi’s, have found their way into some of the 27-year-old British men’s wear designer’s recent collections. In fact, a thread of nostalgia runs through all of Ahluwalia’s designs: In addition to drawing from the aesthetics prominent during her own childhood, she pays homage to those of other cultural epochs, as well as to her family’s Nigerian, Indian and Jamaican heritage and the broader immigrant experience in the United Kingdom.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/priya-ahluwalia-fashion-menswear.html

She believes the election of Donald Trump added fuel to her fire, and indeed, these days, as we witness the continuing state-sanctioned murder of Black people, her work feels especially relevant. Yet the western Massachusetts-based Clark, 53, isn’t making work for the news cycle. While some political art can, like Trump himself, feel temporary, a product of and for its time, Clark’s goes to the root of longstanding injustices and hypocrisies woven, if not into the actual flag, then into the metaphorical fabric of American culture.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/sonya-clark-flags-art.html

During their five years in the desert, Kamara and her father, a mining engineer, traveled frequently into the nearby mountains, where they visited caves rich with neolithic paintings and polished stone, remnants of a time when the area was green and populated by nomads. “This open archaeological site really gave me a sense of what my region is about,” says Kamara, 41, who splits her time between Providence, R.I., where her husband is a professor of computer science at Brown University, and Niamey, where her firm, Atelier Masomi, has operated since 2014. “It’s not the story we’re fed about Africa being this place with no history.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/mariam-kamara-architect-design.html

Gary, flanked by a camera crew and with a microphone in hand, had stopped her to ask a simple question: “Do you feel safe?” Beecher, who is standing with her grandfather, answers yes and proceeds to tell Gary about how she feels prepared to leave the house every day, but that there are times when she is upset about having to wake up early for school. Gary agrees that waking up early is, in fact, the worst, and then asks Beecher if, for the most part, she feels good.

2020-08-10,The Designer Bringing Traditional Persian Fabrics to British Men’s Wear,"This past January, during men’s fashion week in London, the designer Paria Farzaneh invited guests to an East London boys’ school for an Iranian wedding. A bride sat onstage in a traditional white lace gown before a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing with pastel-colored roses and baby’s breath. The groom, seated next to her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic. An older community leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the viewers sat divided by gender — men on one side of the aisle, women on the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh’s part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry — where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity — and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzaneh’s namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/paria-farzaneh-fashion-menswear.html

Garouste was born into a Jewish family in 1946, just after World War II ended, and had a grandmother who didn’t mince words when it came to describing the recent atrocities. “I transferred a kind of terror onto everything,” Garouste reflects, “and, really, I may have decided to make furniture as a means of taming those items that I grew up with.” Her primary aim for the pieces she now creates is to endow each with a buoyant personality.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/elizabeth-garouste-interior-design.html

2020-08-10,The Jewelry Designer Inspired by Ancient Rituals and Artifacts,"It’s telling that it was an artifact, not a stone or a vintage bauble, that set the London-based designer Alice Cicolini on her path to making jewelry. Thirteen years ago, while working as the director of arts and culture at the British Council in India, Cicolini traveled to Mehrangarh, a resplendent 15th-century fort and series of palaces with an accompanying museum in Jodhpur. Among the collection of courtly textiles, armory and miniature paintings, a maharani jewelry box caught her eye. “It would have housed many of the things you need to perform solah shringar,” she explains, referring to the ancient Hindu practice of a bride on her wedding day wearing 16 traditional adornments, from bell-embellished anklets to glass and gold bangles. “The box itself was fairly ordinary looking, but the idea of what its contents constituted was magic to me.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/alice-cicolini-jewelry-art.html

As the model Maya Monés, her ’60s-inspired shoulder-length wig flipped upward at the ends, made the customary spin at the edge of the catwalk, she brushed her palms across two short words spelled out by the gems, the declaration of a singular presence: “No Sesso.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/pierre-davis-no-sesso.html
2020-08-10,A Floral Designer Who Forages in the Hills of Malibu,"Sophia Moreno-Bunge sees possibilities for floral design everywhere: in mushrooms, seaweed, driftwood, bread, tomatoes on the vine. “It’s the weird, overlooked, maybe forgotten things,” she says of the materials that capture her imagination and coalesce in unexpected arrangements that might combine plumes of papyrus, say, with waxy chartreuse anthuriums and a branch of ripening green lemons. Indeed, Moreno-Bunge is part of a new wave of designers — among them the Berlin-based studio Mary Lennox and the New York-based Joshua Werber — for whom the term florist seems too narrow a definition; they’re artists who not only confirm the obvious appeal of blooms but also reveal the magnificence of their landscapes’ less flamboyant elements: leaves, vegetables, seedpods, weeds and humble grasses.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/t-magazine/sophia-moreno-bunge-floral-design.html

Also interviewed are public figures like the Rev.

The tedium of lockdown finds an analogue in his 1974 performance “I Like America and America Likes Me,” in which he shut himself in a SoHo art gallery for three days with a live coyote, some straw, dozens of copies of The Wall Street Journal and a heap of wool felt. Beuys understood that the animal imperative of survival is never far from our lives, even when that imperative is tidied and civilized almost beyond recognition.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/magazine/the-spiritual-power-of-fat.html
2020-08-12,The Fandom Around R.B.G. Is Out of Step With Reality,"When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg revealed last month that she had been treated for cancerous lesions on her liver, a YouTube video whispered across the liberal internet like a prayer. The video, titled “Hang On Ruthie!” is a 2018 parody of the McCoys’ 1965 hit “Hang On Sloopy,” and every few months, it is resurrected through boomer chain emails and Facebook pages with names like the Rude Liberals. Filmed “somewhere in Oregon” by the musical duo Buffalo Romeo, “Hang On Ruthie!” features the earnestly progressive trappings of the Pacific Northwest (a local lesbian choir sings backup in black judicial robes) and a charmingly amateurish production (still photographs of Supreme Court justices are made to wink or bob their heads to the beat). The “Sloopy” lyrics are recast to celebrate Ginsburg’s legal prowess: “You know you argue so good/You know your briefs are so tight/You got the juris and the prudence/Keep counsel up all night.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/magazine/the-fandom-around-rbg-is-out-of-step-with-reality.html

We remember blackout cake from Ebinger’s and pizza from DiFara, now famous but then the local slice joint. So one recent night, when we were finishing dinner and Michael said, “I was thinking about the ice cream at that restaurant near Coney Island Avenue,” I jumped in and said, “Remember how it always had itsy bits of ice in it!” It was just the point he wanted to make. The ice was always there, but somehow still always unexpected. I liked it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/magazine/the-particular-texture-and-joy-of-homemade-ice-cream.html

The 3.5-ounce fillets come beechwood roasted, plain, and also seasoned with chile and lime, or crusted with pepper and spices. A fourth variety, Double Manuka, roasted over manuka wood and seasoned with manuka honey, is extremely rich. The fillets each make a nice single serving and are excellent at room temperature.

The cannons of a storm sounded in the distance. In Sarah’s apartment, where she kept the tall sliding windows open, she felt the gusts even in her sleep, the geckos hunting on her walls scattering, moving toward the ceiling and its deeper shadow. She dreamed that she was swimming in an indoor pool back in New York, at the old YWCA near Fifty-Third Street, alone and chilled, until a siren wailed in the distance and the pool disintegrated. Her eyes opened, the equator returned, and the sweat on her back failed to dry. She panicked for a moment and felt for the edge of her mattress to situate herself. What day was it? Koel birds called out across the city, whooping laments, and at once she remembered the waste lots of jungle below her windows with their listing flame trees alongside the ruined tobacco warehouses that had stood there since the Japanese occupation. A faint hum came from the stormy Saen Saep Canal nearby, its black water churning with dawn commuter boats. She was alone among the flies, and the moon was still high above the dirty white skyscrapers of Bangkok.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/books/review/the-glass-kingdom-by-lawrence-osborne-an-excerpt.html

All of that is especially true now: With most travel put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, endless afternoons rattling around my apartment near Boston have left my mind with little to do but wander. My nostalgia, though, goes deeper than mere sense memory. What I’m really longing for is the more ambiguous perspective that arriving there imparts.

That period and the decade or so of video-game innovations that followed are the focus of “High Score,” a six-part series.

2020-08-20,What if We Worried Less About the Accuracy of Coronavirus Tests?,"Accuracy is everything, typically, when we take a diagnostic test — an incorrect result can lead to anguish and erroneous, if not harmful, treatment. Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/magazine/what-if-we-worried-less-about-the-accuracy-of-coronavirus-tests.html

2020-08-20,A Longstanding and Most Iconic Motif Is Reimagined,"Some logos move in and out of favor with the seasons. Then there’s Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasn’t always been around, nor does it date to the house’s founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Paris’s Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vendôme. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louis’s son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the family’s home in Asnières in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France — when seen through that lens, the monogram can’t help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the era’s great cathedrals. What is certain is that, in designing it, Georges was acting in honor of his father, who had died four years prior, leaving the brand’s legacy in his son’s hands.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/t-magazine/louis-vuitton-speedy-bag.html

In the film, he becomes politicized over his imprisonment and expresses his outrage through art. Directed by Thea Sharrock and based on K.A. Applegate’s Newbery Award-winning book of the same title, this retelling is candy sweet compared with the real Ivan’s cameo in the 1991 documentary “The Urban Gorilla,” which turned him into a 500-pound cause célèbre. This computer-animated Ivan is able to speak for himself (in the voice of Sam Rockwell). As legal efforts in Germany, Argentina and the Balearic Islands have established precedents that could make primate personhood a future civil rights fight, what’s the film’s ratio of fiction to fact?

2020-08-24,Rethinking Who and What Get Memorialized,"This is a magazine devoted to documenting visual culture, whether those visuals come from the worlds of fashion, theater, film, architecture or art. Some of the most striking visuals from the past half-year in America — and there have been many — have concerned the removal or defacement of monuments dedicated to figures from the Confederacy, whose placement in public spaces mostly in the South are, for many of us, an insult, if not an assault. I am not Black, but I keenly remember the discomfort and inexplicable shame I often felt while attending my freshman-year public high school, Robert E. Lee, in Tyler, Texas. Lee was a Confederate general, a slave owner and a commander in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. (The middle school I attended in Tyler, Hubbard, was also named for a former Confederate officer, who later became the state’s governor.) A large portrait of Lee hung in the school gym, and whenever I saw it, I felt as if my right to this country, to Americanness, was being challenged. Why, more than a century later, was someone who had fought for something this country now purported to be against still being honored?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/t-magazine/monuments-womens-fashion-issue.html

More than a third of these monuments have been removed since May 25 of this year alone, when a Minnesota police officer named Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, was caught on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for more than eight minutes while Floyd pleaded for his life. (As a point of comparison, for the nearly 100 years between 1923 and 2015, only nine such monuments were removed.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/t-magazine/confederate-monuments-reimagined-racism.html

2020-08-25,"‘El Jefe,’ by Alan Feuer: An Excerpt","It came in off the street one day—a tip, a lead, a rumor—whatever you cared to call it, it was one of the strangest things they had heard in their careers. Chapo Guzmán, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed report—perhaps that was the best way to describe it—had arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBI’s field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trade’s biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipster’s account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first name—Christian—and that he was from Medellín, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the world’s most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype. As alluring as it sounded, it was just the sort of thing that would probably turn out to be a myth.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/books/review/el-jefe-by-alan-feuer-an-excerpt.html

These were the early days of autumn, and his arms and cheeks were still summer-bronzed and freckled over the last layers of his baby fat. He was eleven years old and an expert butterfly collector. Probably the top kid-lepidopterist in Champaign County, in his own humble opinion. At night his bones ached and added marrow, and each morning his limbs felt more sinewy and masculine, as if he’d somehow entered the body of Davy Crockett. Or Daniel Boone. Manhood was calling to him in the contracting muscles of his calves and his bulkier biceps, but not yet in his loins.

He is pissed off that it hasn’t happened yet. “I think about this a lot,” he says. “Why, in this woke-ass culture that we live in, where so much attention is given to marginalized populations, do people with disabilities still largely go ignored?” The actor, who has cerebral palsy, is also, he says, “horny for representation that comes from actual disabled people, because we live in a dark hellscape of a capitalist country.

Prior to the pandemic, this city was experiencing something of a renaissance but still had a long way to go.)

On their way home, they are pulled over by a police officer (Sturgill Simpson) — an encounter that turns deadly.

The screenplay, by Lena Waithe, taps into urgent conversations about race in America. “I don’t want this movie to be as relevant as it is,” Waithe said in an interview with The New York Times when the film came out. “But the scary thing is the movie becomes more and more relevant with every passing day.” That was late last year.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-queen-slim-and-hamlet.html

This rigorously modern approach to design — often characterized by unbroken expanses of single materials (a wall of burled elm in one store, diamond-embossed aluminum in another) combined with inviting planes of color (a peony-pink wall-to-wall carpet, for example, or a standing shelving unit in copper sulfate blue) — has made Halleroed, the design studio that Christian, 46, founded in Stockholm in 1998, and which Ruxandra, 39, joined in 2015, sought after by fashion brands, particularly young Scandinavian labels whose gameness for experimentation resonates with the firm’s own.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/t-magazine/cottage-stockholm-home-design.html

This fact, that what some see as a flicker of natural brilliance is to others a nuisance to be removed, puts the lesser celandine, along with many other wildflowers, in a precarious position. And indeed, so many gardeners come down on the side of “nuisance” that to cultivate wildflowers purposely, to allow them to be the focus of one’s labors, even, is something of a rebellious act.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/t-magazine/garden-flowers-art-stationery.html

2020-08-28,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Following’ and ‘The Roads Not Taken’,"FOLLOWING (1998) Stream on Criterion Channel and IFC Films Unlimited; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. When hardy audiences trek to theaters to see Christopher Nolan’s latest mind-bender, “Tenet,” in theaters next week, they can expect two things: masks in the movie house and puzzles on the screen. For that has been the Nolan way for nearly two decades: In 2001, Nolan’s “Memento” offered “a series of clever epistemological puzzles,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Nolan’s film “The Prestige,” from 2006, “has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure,” Scott wrote in his review. The filmmaker’s 2010 dream-hopper, “Inception”? It “trades in crafty puzzles,” Scott wrote. “Interstellar” in 2014? “Tantalizing puzzles,” Manohla Dargis wrote. All echo “Following,” Nolan’s 1998 debut feature, which gave a taste of his knack for cinematic discombobulation. Shot on a shoestring — the cost of making “Following,” reported to be in the low thousands, was surely less than the hair gel budget delegated to the men of “Inception” — the film plays fast and loose with chronology, telling the story of a young Londoner (Jeremy Theobald), whose hobby of tailing strangers leads him to the city’s criminal underbelly. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the movie “a black-and-white film noir with a difference,” writing that “the usual elements of scheming and deception are well represented here, but they are made all the knottier by shifting time frames.” And, she noted, the story “offers plenty of intriguing puzzle pieces.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-following-and-the-roads-not-taken.html

Today, such disruptive noisemaking has been borrowed as a form of collective action around the world, often under the name cacerolazo (from the Spanish for “casserole”), popularized by a 1971 demonstration against food shortages in Chile in which more than 5,000 women took to the streets rattling pots, the emptiness of which gave testament to their cause.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/t-magazine/food-protest-revolution.html
