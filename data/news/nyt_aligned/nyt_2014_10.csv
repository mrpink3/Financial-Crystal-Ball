I looked around for some brands that tasted good to me (and I did need to look around), and found some great almond milk made with just about only almonds and water (it has less than 2 percent added ingredients but no sweeteners). For the others, I wanted to use coconut milk, not coconut water, which I think tastes pretty bad no matter how good for you it’s supposed to be.

2014-10-01,His Majesty the Queen,"The Berliner Ensemble returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week, in tandem with the director Robert Wilson, to present an elaborate musical pageant, “Shakespeare’s Sonnets,” featuring a score by the unclassifiable Rufus Wainwright. Twenty-five of the sonnets are set to music by Mr. Wainwright that will reflect his catholic taste, including “medieval German Minnesang, classical, pop and cabaret rock,” according to the publicity release. Expect a similarly venturesome staging from Mr. Wilson, whose production of “The Threepenny Opera” for the Berliner Ensemble was seen in Brooklyn recently. The characters gliding through this production — and I confidently predict a lot of glacial gliding, along with scads of white pancake makeup — will include Shakespeare himself, Elizabeth I and the two principal objects of affection addressed in the sonnets. Fluidity of gender will be emphasized by having the female roles played by men and the male roles played by women.

But let this be an alert to all lovers of superb pianism. This is a timely and revealing release. Malcuzynski (1914-77) had trouble escaping the shadow of the older Polish pianist Arthur Rubinstein.

Simple looking, a mere four letters, the word in question appears in “Comma,” the book’s spare and horrifying second tale. Two little girls have clambered over a wall in order to spy on the residents of a mansion known simply as the Hathaways’ house. Mary, a budding juvenile delinquent and the older and bossier of the pair, has told her companion, the 8-year-old narrator, Kitty, that something frightful and mysterious dwells in the house: a pale lumpen creature “wrapped in a blanket,” “something you couldn’t put a name to.” It might be human (“It’s got arms”), but all Mary can say for sure is that it’s awful and shaped like a “comma.” While they hide in the bushes, breathlessly hoping for some glimpse of the creature — it’s a parched midsummer day — Kitty notices “that in the beds of this garden the roses were already scorched into heavy brown blebs on the stalk.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/the-assassination-of-margaret-thatcher-by-hilary-mantel.html

The era’s telephone systems required users to connect to a handful of major hubs, which the Soviets would doubtless target in the early hours of World War III. So Baran dreamed up a less vulnerable alternative: a decentralized network that resembled a vast fishnet, with an array of small nodes that were each linked to a few others. These nodes could not only receive signals but also route them along to their neighbors, thereby creating countless possible paths for data to keep flowing should part of the network be destroyed. This data would travel across the structure in tiny chunks, called “packets,” that would self-­assemble into coherent wholes upon reaching their destinations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/the-innovators-by-walter-isaacson.html

The carbon dioxide, separated from the plant’s flue gases, will be piped to a nearby oil field where it will increase oil production from wells and remain permanently underground. About a million tons of the gas are expected to be captured annually – the equivalent of taking about 250,000 cars off the road.

(Starz) ABOUT LAST NIGHT (2014) In this remake of Edward Zwick’s 1986 adaptation of the David Mamet play “Sexual Perversity in Chicago,” the director Steve Pink reimagines Mr. Zwick’s relationship-challenged white yuppies as middle-class African-American residents of Los Angeles. There are two couples — one (Michael Ealy and Joy Bryant) is well behaved; the other (Kevin Hart and Regina Hall), not so much. “Mr. Mamet’s title was always a bit of a misnomer — his jagged play is more interested in romantic confusion and emotional complication than in freaky bedroom matters — but his map of the crooked paths to heterosexual bliss remains useful and adaptable, even when softened and tidied up by Hollywood,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times.

2014-10-03,1914: Germany Attacks Tahiti,"BORDEAUX — The following naval official communiqué is published in the ‘‘Moniteur de la Flotte:’’ On September 22 the German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau arrived off Papeete, the centre of the French establishments in Australasia and the capital of Tahiti, chief of the Society Islands. In port was the French gunboat La Zélée, without her guns or her crew. La Zélée is a gunboat of 647 tons, entirely unprotected. The two large armored cruisers of 11,600 tons, each armed with eight 210mm. guns, six 150mm. guns and twenty 88mm. guns, heroically sank our little ship at anchor, deprived of all means of attack or defence. To complete this laudable feat, the German cruisers bombarded and half destroyed Papeete. Then they steamed away. All ports in the Pacific being occupied by Anglo-French forces, the career of the Scharnhorst and of the Gneisenau must inevitably soon come to an end, for coaling for them will soon become impossible and they will have to measure themselves against, not a little wooden hull without arms or defenders, but against real warships, the French, British, Japanese and Russian cruisers which are seeking them in the Pacific. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Oct. 4, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/1914-germany-attacks-tahiti/

2014-10-03,Inside the List,"Reading Time: From 1996 to 2011, the most powerful woman in publishing didn’t work in publishing; she worked in TV. I’m talking of course about Oprah Winfrey, whose stamp of approval helped sell tens of millions of books during the 15-year run of her original book club. (She has since introduced a lower-key version she calls Oprah’s Book Club 2.0.) Winfrey’s name is pretty much guaranteed to propel a title onto the list — but she didn’t have a best seller all her own until last month, when her inspirational collection “What I Know for Sure” made its debut at No. 1 on the advice and how-to list, available online. The book, currently No. 6 in its fourth week, gathers Winfrey’s columns for O, The Oprah Magazine, mixing gauzy self-help mantras (“Your spirit,” she writes, “is whispering its greatest desires for you”) with folksy glimpses of her personal life (she grows radishes “so big I call them baboon butts”). She also writes about her love of books. “Everything I do all day, I do in preparation for my reading time,” she says. “Give me a great novel or memoir, some tea and a cozy spot to curl up in, and I’m in heaven. . . . Insight, information, knowledge, inspiration, power: All that and more can come through a good book.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2014-10-03,Moral of the Story,"Regionalism has always played an important part in American literature, with, say, William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County the iconic Southern example. Those who have read Marilynne Robinson’s radiant Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Gilead,” will remember that imaginary town in southernmost Iowa, near the conjunction of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska — Plains country, partially Southern in spirit and looking west, thereby broadly embodying the essential rural Midwestern America at a seminal period, from the Depression to around 1950. Although American literature isn’t usually known for its religious and philosophical novels, we might think of certain essential works, particularly of Melville and Hawthorne, that concern grace and redemption. Robinson’s new novel, “Lila,” combines these regional and spiritual strains of American writing. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/lila-by-marilynne-robinson.html
2014-10-03,Putting Down the Gun,"Charles Blow was only 24 when he was asked by The New York Times to direct its graphics department — apparently the youngest department head in the paper’s history.

2014-10-03,Viper’s Nest,"When Elie Wiesel approached the ­author François Mauriac in the 1950s with a draft of the memoir that would become “Night,” Mauriac was skeptical — not of the book’s quality, but of its necessity. What on earth could “this personal rec­ord, coming as it does after so many others and describing an abomination such as we might have thought no longer had any secrets for us,” have to add to the already vast body of literature about the Holocaust? he wondered. One reads this now with an ironic chuckle. As we approach the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Holocaust, among all its other perverse distinctions, has become the most documented genocide in history. There are memoirs by both survivors and high-ranking Nazis; diaries of life under Nazi rule; collections of letters between SS ­officers and their families; specific investigations of the Nazi doctors, the last few months of the war and the structure of the SS; and multiple biographies of figures major and minor.

This situation was exacerbated in the 1970s, when economic history began to migrate from history to economics departments, where it too often became an exercise in scouring the past for numerical data to plug into computerized models of the economy. Recently, however, the history of American capitalism has emerged as a thriving cottage industry. This new work portrays capitalism not as a given (something that “came in the first ships,” as the historian Carl Degler once wrote) but as a system that developed over time, has been constantly evolving and penetrates all aspects of society.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/the-half-has-never-been-told-by-edward-e-baptist.html

2014-10-03,Dirty Secrets,"Joe Gunther, one of the most honorable lawmen you’d ever hope to meet, is the designated mourner in Archer Mayor’s rugged regional mysteries. Over the course of some two dozen novels, the former Brattleboro cop, now a senior officer with the Vermont Bureau of Investigation, has borne witness to all the scourges of modern times — from the meth epidemic to freakish acts of nature like Hurricane Irene — that have laid havoc to his home state. But in the background, there have always been glimpses of another painful legacy — the human fallout from the Vietnam War — that now steps out from the shadows in PROOF POSITIVE (Minotaur, $25.99). No one in the village of Dummerston gave much thought to an eccentric hoarder named Benjamin Kendall until a hapless thief burgles his old farmhouse and finds Kendall buried under the towering mounds of detritus. A sad business, but not a case for a major crimes unit like the V.B.I., you’d think; until another body is pulled from the artfully arranged rubble. As it turns out, the reclusive hoarder was a photojournalist who had suffered a brain injury in Vietnam. Thanks to an enterprising art student who arranged for an exhibition of his war photos at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Kendall had finally come to the attention of the art world — and of an enemy who would kill to keep the past buried in the past.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/archer-mayors-proof-positive-and-more.html

She and a team of other doctors quickly diagnosed lupus, an autoimmune disease. But as they hurried to treat the girl, Frankovich thought that something about the patient’s particular combination of lupus symptoms — kidney problems, inflamed pancreas and blood vessels — rang a bell. In the past, she’d seen lupus patients with these symptoms develop life-threatening blood clots. Her colleagues in other specialties didn’t think there was cause to give the girl anti-clotting drugs, so Frankovich deferred to them.

Some staff members felt that we should try to stop him, to honor his parents’ wishes (they listed tea and coffee as a dietary restriction). I disagreed; coffee is not dangerous, and I think high-school students are capable of deciding which religious strictures to follow. The camp is legally responsible for students, and we strive to create a safe environment in their families’ stead. But are we ethically bound to enforce their families’ other preferences as well?

2014-10-03,Pagans and Christians,"Occasionally in the debates about Christianity’s weakened position in American culture, you’ll hear traditionalists and conservatives analogize the Christian situation, now or soon, to the environment the faith faced in its earliest centuries, as an embattled minority in a hostile pagan empire. I’m not a particular fan of this analogy, for various reasons: Not only because lions-and-catacombs imagery risks trivializing the concept of persecution at a time when Christians outside the United States face actual Diocletian-style consequences for their beliefs (and don’t always receive the charity they deserve from their American co-believers), but also because describing contemporary American culture as pagan in the style of the ancient world strikes me as a category error, which underplays the extent to which middlebrow American spirituality is still infused with Christian-ish sentiments and assumptions and ideas, and underplays, as well, just how radically different a thoroughly repaganized society would be from the one we (happily) inhabit today.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/pagans-and-christians/

She knows of what she speaks: For nearly three decades of an on-again, off-again career, her band has cranked out infectious little gems that have influenced countless other musicians — most notably Kurt Cobain, who covered several of their songs with Nirvana. The duo’s latest album, “V for Vaselines” (out Oct. 7 from Rosary Music), is its third since Kelly and McKee reunited in 2006. Featuring contributions from members of Belle and Sebastian and Teenage Fanclub and recorded in the studio of Mogwai, it’s a reflection of the close-knit musical community in the Vaselines’s hometown of Glasgow. What’s truly great about the album, however, is the way it captures Kelly and McKee’s mastery at creating shambolic tunes that are equal parts hooks and heartbreak.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/vaselines-band-eugene-kelly-francis-mckee-favorite-songs-playlists/

Here’s what we know or think we do: Revolving around a troupe of human curiosities that collides with a savage entity in drowsy Jupiter, Fla., circa 1952, “Freak Show” brings back series regulars like Jessica Lange, who portrays the German expat in charge; Sarah Paulson as conjoined twins; Kathy Bates as a bearded lady; and Angela Bassett as a three-breasted woman. It also introduces Michael Chiklis as a strongman; Wes Bentley as a two-faced tormentor; and Jyoti Amge, the world’s smallest woman, as exactly that. “It’s cracking open the head of Ryan Murphy,” John Carroll Lynch, who plays Twisty the Clown, said of the show’s creator (with Brad Falchuk) in an interview with The New York Times this summer. “It’s very disturbing in there.” If Mr. Lynch ever musters the nerve to see the show himself, he said, “I’ll be watching it through my fingers.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/arts/television/american-horror-story-freak-show-is-the-seriess-latest-theme.html

2014-10-03,"God, Egyptians and Amazons","Opera Lafayette, the Washington period-instrument group that has gained a strong reputation for its stagings of obscure 18th-century French repertory, needs little additional reason to champion the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau. But the 250th anniversary of his death offers an ideal peg for a new staging of his “Les Fêtes de l’Hymen et de l’Amour, ou Les Dieux d’Égypte” (“The Celebrations of Marriage and Love, or The Gods of Egypt”), which will be performed in New York on Thursday. Rameau’s orchestration and harmony were both revolutionary and controversial. Some 18th-century listeners rejected his musical aesthetic, which was inspired in part by science and philosophy. Dance was also a crucial element for Rameau; Louis de Cahusac, the librettist of this court opera (first performed in 1747) integrated dance into the plot instead of using it merely as a decorative device. Opera Lafayette’s production features three diverse troupes — New York Baroque Dance Company (representing a group of Egyptians); Kalanidhi Dance (as a tribe of Amazons); and the Sean Curran Company (as an irate God and his followers).

Many flowers could be used to describe the copper-haired Jodi Melnick, whose gossamer dancing, finely wrought, produces a flood of seemingly translucent images, but the marigold fits: Ms. Melnick may be small, but like the hearty blossom, she is resilient. Beginning Wednesday, she makes her Brooklyn Academy of Music debut with “Moment Marigold,” a trio for her, Maggie Thom and EmmaGrace Skove-Epes featuring music by Steven Reker of the band People Get Ready. In this evening-length work, she laces new movement material with remnants from past dances. Ms. Melnick, whose canvas is her body, creates a landscape of ever-changing forms.

Italian doctors had originally hoped the child could survive without drugs, as a baby born in rural Mississippi in 2010 appeared to do for more than a year. But in July, pediatricians announced that the Mississippi baby had relapsed, indicating that early treatment had not wiped out all the reservoirs of virus. The Milan child was 3 years old in late 2012 and had no detectable virus in blood tests when treatment was stopped, but the virus surged after two weeks. The Milan child was more obviously infected than the Mississippi one, said Dr. Sharon Lewin, a prominent Australian AIDS researcher who is familiar with both cases, because he had other infection markers, including H.I.V.-specific white blood cells.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/health/italy-child-thought-to-be-rid-of-hiv-suffers-a-relapse.html

Then the Immigration and Naturalization Service comes knocking. “The film’s charms are as picture-perfect as anything George and Brontë manage to manufacture,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. In “Amélie” (2001), at 10, Audrey Tautou, in her breakthrough role, plays a French sprite working as a waitress who lays out elaborate practical jokes as payback for those who offend her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amélie finds herself unable to reveal her feelings and instead turns Paris, recreated through sets and computer-generated imagery, into a kind of treasure hunt as she leaves clues about her identity and he trails after her. Writing in The Times, Elvis Mitchell called this comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet whose original title was “Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain,”“a sugar-rush of a movie.” It has, he said, “a hypnotic sense of romance; it’s a fable filled with longing, with a heroine who constantly flirts with failure.” Mr. Mitchell added that there is no denying “that ‘Amélie’ is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

The ambush came as two companies of Vietnamese infantry were returning on foot from a mission. The U.S. soldier killed was a sergeant. His body was airlifted from the scene along with a wounded U.S. adviser. Replying to a call for help, government helicopters and fighter bombers attacked the Viet Cong. Ground forces were also sent to relieve the government troops but the Viet Cong had already with-drawn by the time the relief columns arrived.

USA Today reports that researchers at the Walt Disney Animation Research Library have discovered that a bird with a New York accent was the original sidekick for the evil sorceress Maleficent in Disney’s 1959 classic, “Sleeping Beauty.” An early clip of the film shows the “cultured vulture” in a comic-relief role, trying to disguise himself as less-threatening animals to spy on Princess Aurora. In the end, Sleeping Beauty’s curse was broken, but the vulture wasn’t so lucky. It “didn’t add much to the story and also somewhat detracted from that imposing nature of the villain Maleficent,” Fox Carney, the research manager from Disney’s library, told USA Today. “And this New York type of vulture didn’t fit into the world of this classic medieval Europe where this film is set.” Scenes featuring the original bird will be in bonus features of a Blu-ray edition of “Sleeping Beauty” due out on Tuesday.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/movies/a-disney-discovery-in-forgotten-sketches.html

The demonstration began after intermission and just before the orchestra started playing, Adam Crane, the symphony’s vice president for external affairs, said by phone on Sunday. Mr. Crane was participating in a live radio broadcast of the performance from Powell Hall in St. Louis, when a man stood up in the theater and sang, “Which side are you on, friend, which side are you on?” The man was joined by demonstrators throughout the audience in singing, “Justice for Mike Brown is justice for all.” Mr. Crane estimated that about 50 people from among the roughly 1,500 in attendance participated. Banners were lowered from the balcony reading, “Requiem for Mike Brown 1996-2014,” “Racism lives here” and “Rise up and join the movement,” The St. Louis American reported. Some members of the audience and orchestra applauded the protest, which Mr. Crane said lasted three to five minutes and ended peacefully when the participants left while chanting, “Black lives matter.” The event was organized by Sarah Griesbach, 42, who told The St. Louis American that she felt it was her duty to “raise awareness peacefully but also to disrupt the blind state of white St. Louis.” All the demonstrators had bought tickets, Mr. Crane said. Mr. Brown was shot on Aug. 9 by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. The guest conductor for the evening, Markus Stenz, watched the protest play out from his podium and then resumed the concert.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/arts/music/protesters-delay-st-louis-symphony.html

(13) THE ACT OF KILLING (2013) Using re-enactments created with the help of Anwar Congo and Herman Koto, gangsters involved in the brutal campaign nearly 50 years ago against Communists, ethnic Chinese and critics of the military government that overthrew President Sukarno of Indonesia, the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer recounts massacres that began in 1965 and claimed as many as 2.5 million lives over the next year. “The garish absurdity of some of their performances — there is a musical number in front of a waterfall and another in which dancers parade from the mouth of a giant fish — does not distract from the horror,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar-nominated documentary, presented here by “POV.” “On the contrary, the way that Anwar and Herman use the fantasy language of genre movies as a tool of stylized, half-earnest confession is what grounds this film’s moral inquiry.” He added: “Some queasiness may linger at the thought of a Western filmmaker indulging the creative whims of mass murderers, exploiting both their guilelessness and the suffering of Indonesians who remain voiceless and invisible here.

Her Top Shelf interviews give an uncensored account of the beauty routines of everyone from models to fashion moguls and have become something of an obsessive read for many; to date, the site generates 10 million page views per month. All of which naturally led to her next move: launching a beauty line called Glossier, which comes out today. But does the world really need another mascara? As Weiss explains, “there are great products out there, but not a single brand that spoke to me, that I really identified with. So I wanted Glossier to be simple and effective but not too precious.” To that end, she developed four basic skin-care items “for real life”: a face mist, moisturizer, skin tint and multitasking balm, which she’s already put into the hands of friends and followers (Karlie Kloss, Garance Doré).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/emily-weiss-into-the-gloss-glossier/

2014-10-07,What’s on TV Tuesday,"12:30 P.M. (Sundance) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this Woody Allen tribute to Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer (Flavio Parenti). Also in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star, while her befuddled husband (Alessandro Tiberi) tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) visits. Alec Baldwin, above left with Mr. Eisenberg, plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movie’s limitations, “as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

That changed in 2008, when the city hosted America’s largest international biennial, Prospect.1, to help bolster its post-Katrina renaissance. Kicking off this month is the exhibition’s third installment, Prospect.3, during which museums, public parks and galleries dotting scrappy St. Claude Avenue will be transformed into a showcase for nearly 60 artists from around the world. Curated by Franklin Sirmans of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Prospect.3 aims to be a reflection of the city’s singular spirit — a show that mixes the canonized with the newly celebrated (Jean-Michel Basquiat, Camille Henrot, Lucien Smith) to explore ideas about the American South, crime and punishment and the region’s embrace of Mardi Gras culture. “New Orleans is a place where you have this high contrast between the clean and the dirty, the good and the bad, the old and the new, those who have and those who have not,” Sirmans says. “It’s really a microcosm of our whole country.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/new-orleans-art-festival-prospect-3/

With rich red banquettes and walls dotted with Art Deco paintings, London’s most storied members-only boîte has for decades been home to celebrity habitués like Frank Sinatra and Lady Gaga, and has become synonymous with revelry and riotous nights. In “A String of Naked Lightbulbs,” produced by Ridley Scott, actors, supermodels and rock stars conjure the blurry nocturnal memories they shared at the establishment — reportedly the only bar ever patronized by Her Majesty the Queen. The film focuses quite a bit on the drink of choice — claret, always claret — and the strict dress code that once kept the Beatles from getting through the door (in fairness, they weren’t wearing shoes). And while it does an excellent job of recapping the early days of the scene, it also makes a case for the venue’s enduring relevance. “I think when something is put together with that kind of affection,” the musician Bryan Ferry says, “it kind of lasts forever.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/ridley-scott-string-of-naked-lightbulbs-annabels/

The story, which ran in T’s Culture Issue earlier this year, opened with a picture of a hardy orange tree that flanks the library there. It is one of the many artfully arranged fruit trees she planted, which include the espalier apple tree, shown in the above photo of Mellon at home in 1982. In fact, she loved fruit trees so much that she used them to anchor the Rose Garden at the White House, which she designed at the Kennedys’ request. She even wore one as a brooch: circa 1950, Duke Fulco di Verdura designed a 14-karat-gold and platinum brooch to look like the very same espalier apple tree Mellon grew at home. With diamonds for leaves and rubies as apples, the design is estimated to fetch from $2,500 to $3,500 next month at Sotheby’s, which will host auctions of all of Mellon’s most beautiful belongings (she passed away this past spring at the age of 103).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/bunny-mellon-jewelry-verdura-sothebys/

As a result, a critical cocoon has formed around Dunham wherein it’s O.K. to acknowledge her as a feminist icon, but beyond that lies a danger zone — after all, who wants one’s opinions lumped in with the slavishly syco­phantic, the nakedly jealous, the casually misogynistic or the blatantly ageist?

There are stretches so platitudinous that it’s almost impossible not to hear blah blah BLAH blah Blaaaaaaaaaaah chiming in one’s head: “I’m a big believer in making your own luck.” Then there are moments of immensely appealing self-disclosure that seldom appear in other books of this genre: “I was a slightly straighter arrow than my mother.

2014-10-10,What’s on TV Friday,"9 P.M. (13) THE NANCE Nathan Lane, whose performance earned him a Tony nomination, portrays Chauncey Miles, a closeted burlesque actor in 1930s New York who plays a caricature of his clandestine self onstage — the only place he seems truly happy. Jonny Orsini is the rough-edged Ned, whom Chauncey loves in secret, in Douglas Carter Beane’s drama, directed by Jack O’Brien and produced by Lincoln Center Theater. But Chauncey’s private and personal lives collide when the city cracks down on burlesque houses, especially those featuring the effeminate, innuendo-rich characters that he specializes in. “Mr. Beane, Mr. O’Brien and their creative associates have obviously done their research,” Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times about the play, which is seen here in a “Live From Lincoln Center” presentation, directed for the screen by Matthew Diamond. “As a document of both a vanished form of theater and forbidden love in an age of repression, ‘The Nance’ — which has been designed with beautifully shabby flair by a team that includes John Lee Beatty (sets) and Ann Roth (costumes) — has been shaped with imaginative empathy.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

There, five waiters presented them with a seven-course tasting menu (after the trio of canapés and an amuse-bouche, naturellement). The meal was overseen by the star chef and eponym himself, Daniel Boulud, whose goal was, he says, “for the children to really discover a lot of flavor, a lot of layers, a lot of texture.” These discoveries included Smoked Paprika Cured Hamachi (the “most-foreign thing for them,” Boulud says), Crispy Japanese Snapper (“which they loved to see”) and Wagyu Beef Rib-Eye (“a big success”). To capture the children’s reactions, the magazine asked Jeffrey Blitz, the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Spellbound,” to make a video. The initiates seemed to enjoy the experience, but that isn’t to say they loved all those flavors and textures. At one point, after tasting a custom-made nonalcoholic cocktail, 7-year-old Chester Parish said: “This is, like, the only good course. It’s yummy.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/magazine/fine-dining-for-second-graders.html

Finland ignored demands from Moscow that its foreign minister be sent to Russia to conclude an economic and political treaty which would have handed over strategically important islands and ports in both north and south Finland. Instead, the Finnish minister to Sweden, a diplomatic and economic authority, left for Moscow at the head of a mission. The Finns are solidly united in their determination to remain neutral in the present European struggle and to resist aggression. Two hundred thousand Finnish troops are reported massed on the Soviet frontier. Evacuation of numerous towns and villages along the frontier has been ordered, and voluntary civilian evacuation of the capital, Helsingfors, has been asked. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 11, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/1939-finns-resist-soviet-aggression/

2014-10-10,Inside the List,"Blue and Gray and Read All Over: The Civil War ended almost a century and a half ago. But it’s still going strong on the best-seller lists — in 2014 alone, the conflict has appeared on the graphic books list, the hardcover fiction list, the children’s picture books list and the e-books nonfiction list. (One digital best seller, Tim Rowland’s “Strange and Obscure Stories of the Civil War,” features two photo illustrations on the cover: one of a bearded lady with the caption “Sarah Emma Edmonds was a complicated girl,” the other of a battle scene with the caption “Unleashing a maelstrom of fiery hell at a pheasant.” I believe I am warming to e-books.) The latest title to join this march is S. C. Gwynne’s “Rebel Yell: The Violence, Passion, and Redemption of Stonewall Jackson,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Gwynne — who spent more than a year on the paperback list with his previous book, “Empire of the Summer Moon,” about the Comanche chief Quanah Parker — told The Austin American-Statesman he was especially interested in how Thomas Jackson went, in 14 months, from being an eccentric and unsuccessful college professor to leading the Rebel forces in the Shenandoah Valley campaign. “What fascinates me about Jackson is the idea of transformation,” he said. “He became the most famous man of the war.” Gwynne knows something about personal transformation. In the early 1980s he was working as a banker and dreaming of a writing career when his wife went on the game show “Tic-Tac-Dough” and won $60,000. “That money lasted for years,” he told The American-Statesman. “So I quit banking.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2014-10-10,Worthwhile Woolf,"The New York Times and Virginia Woolf didn’t get off to a great start. In an unsigned review of her first novel, “The Voyage Out,” in the daily Times in 1920, the critic found, “aside from a certain cleverness,” “little in this offering to make it stand out from the ruck of mediocre novels which make far less literary pretension.” The review did note “a possibility of something worthwhile from the same pen in the future.” Indeed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/worthwhile-woolf.html

She has tacked magazine photos of her celebrity crushes and quotations from her literary idols to her walls, but they seem only to remind her of how far she has to go. She’s a chubby teenager whose large family lives on government assistance in a working-class city in middle England. Her most fulfilling sexual relationship has been with the handle of her hairbrush.

2014-10-10,The Other Self,"In “A Room of One’s Own,” Virginia Woolf considers the difficulties facing the unhistoried, culturally marginalized woman writer: “Perhaps the first thing she would find, setting pen to paper, was that there was no common sentence ready for her use. . . . Moreover, a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses.” If women’s literature were to have a future, she continues, there is a “great part which must be played in that future . . . by physical conditions. The book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that women’s books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men, and framed so that they do not need long hours of steady and uninterrupted work. For interruptions there will always be.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/sarah-ruhls-100-essays-i-dont-have-time-to-write.html

(CW) JANE THE VIRGIN Gina Rodriguez, above, stars as Jane, the determined daughter of a single mother (Andrea Navedo) who has promised her deeply religious grandmother (Ivonne Coll) that she will remain a virgin until marriage. Fortunately, her boyfriend (Brett Dier) understands — that is, until Jane ends up pregnant after being accidentally inseminated with the sperm of Rafael (Justin Baldoni), a hunky Miami hotelier, former playboy and cancer survivor rendered infertile with whom Jane happened to share a kiss long ago. Yael Grobglas plays Rafael’s scheming wife, who wants to keep their marriage intact for financial reasons despite sleeping with his best friend. The series “isn’t a Cinderella fable, it’s a charming screwball comedy folded into a spoof of telenovelas,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times about this series loosely based on a Venezuelan daytime soap “but refitted with ironic distance and much more artful cinematography.” “Jane the Virgin,” she added, “isn’t exactly sui generis: It has traces of past series that blended whimsy and wile, including ‘Ugly Betty’ and ‘Pushing Daisies,’ but this show has a delightful heroine and its own sweetly wicked inflection.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

An affiliated organization, the Memorial Center for Human Rights, founded in 1991, focuses on current human rights abuses, and has been the target of repeated efforts of government officials to curtail its activities.

The ministry’s lawsuit against the Memorial Society was filed last month but reported only on Friday. A report on the NTV television channel accused the Memorial Center for Human Rights of supporting Islamic terrorists.

Dr. Martin Luther King, the 35-year-old American Negro leader, today [Oct. 14] was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his ‘‘consistent support’’ of the principle of nonviolence in the Negro campaign for civil rights. He said he would use the 273,000 Swedish crowns prize (about $53,000) to strengthen the civil rights campaign in the United States. Dr. King is the 12th American to receive the prize. He is the second Negro leader to win in four years. The 1960 award was given to Albert Luthuli, of South Africa. A third Negro, Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, of the United States, was the 1950 winner. Dr. King, whose fight against racial discrimination has brought him many jail terms, will receive the prize at Oslo University on Dec. 10. ‘‘I do not consider this merely an honor to me personally, but a tribute to the discipline, wise restraint and majestic courage of the millions of gallant Negro and white persons of good will who have followed a nonviolent course in seeking to establish a reign of justice and a rule of love across this nation of ours,’’ he said. Dr. King was selected from a list proposed by former Peace Prize winners, members of governments and parliaments around the world and other dignitaries. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 15, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/1964-martin-luther-king-jr-awarded-nobel-peace-prize/

The film comes across as less a portrait of complex intellectuals ideologically embroiled in a conflict than as a weepie about innocents adrift.” Mr. Ejiofor can also be seen as Solomon Northup, a free black man who, in 1841, was kidnapped and sold into slavery, in “12 Years a Slave” (2013), the Oscar winner for best picture, at 11 on HBO2.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/arts/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

2014-10-16,"Québécois Circusry, Artisanal Edition","Recently, NYU’s Skirball Center has made itself a prime venue for a very niche form of entertainment: contemporary circus arts from Quebec, whose legendary National Circus School has spawned not only the glitzily famous Cirque du Soleil but a slew of smaller, more DIY companies, such as Cirque Eloize, which performed at Skirball last winter. Now through Sunday comes Cirque Alfonse’s “Timber,” which takes circusry to an artisanal, organic extreme. The troupe — which hails from the sylvan-paradise village of Saint-Alphonse-Rodriguez and is composed largely of burly, bearded fellas who lift themselves and one another into the air in various improbable configurations, plus three generations of family members, from a lovably cranky grandpa right down to an adorable mop-haired tyke — makes all of its sets and equipment from wood and other materials found on its own farm. The stage has an indie-woodsy look for which most Brooklyn coffee-shop owners would sacrifice their flannel and Red Wings. And the performers come by this show’s name the hard way: over the course of its hour-plus run time, no end of sharp-edged hatchets and giant crosscut saws are juggled, tossed and spun — often mere, unnerving inches away from those bushy beards.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/cirque-alfonse-artisanal-circus/

(Shladovsky also creates conceptual furniture that has caught the eye of, for one, Peter Marino, who installed her works in a slew of Dior boutiques worldwide.) “What’s difficult to do is go beyond your own creative community; is to engage the larger community,” she continues. “Interior designers tend to go to their events; the art world tends to stick together; the film world and music people, too.” Shladovsky has a plan to change all that.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/azadeh-shladovsky-unscene-video/

Mr. Swope and Mr. Hurst collected 120 of the photos into a book, published in 2005 by Powerhouse and now in its third printing. The photos even inspired a Broadway play, “Casa Valentina,” by Harvey Fierstein, which opened last spring. Now, Mr. Hurst and Mr. Swope are selling all 340 images at auction at Wright in Chicago on Oct. 30, hoping an institution will buy them for public display. “There’s a special magic seeing the pictures in person,” Mr. Swope said.

(As an opening offer, a yoga class comes free with the purchase of a cold-pressed juice.) “But it’s complicated to do all of these things in one place,” explains his partner Kimberly Helms, walking by a back office that has already been rented to a nonprofit that rescues farm animals. “So we approached it similarly to producing a show: by building the best team.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/the-springs-los-angeles-wellness-center/

The exploits of the 350 or so men and women from 13 countries who were with the unit from 1943 to 1951 have been chronicled in books including “The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History,” written by Robert M. Edsel, with Bret Witter, which served as the basis for this film directed by Mr. Clooney, who wrote the screenplay with his producing partner, Grant Heslov. “ 'The Monuments Men’ slices off a sliver of a great World War II story and turns it into a lightweight entertainment that doesn’t ask you to think too hard,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “That’s too bad, because if there’s anyone who you expect to smarten up a joint, it’s Mr. Clooney. The brain trust behind the original Monuments Men was staggering and included individuals who helped run some of America’s greatest cultural institutions. At the very least you expect their fictional counterparts to exchange a little shoptalk and some thoughts on art, literature and the latest restoration techniques or maybe just gossip about Picasso’s latest mistress.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2014-10-17,A Bevy of the Best,"In his introduction to “The Best Short Stories of 1915,” Edward J.

Montgomery’s beloved Anne of Green Gables, insisting that she can call a picture a poem. If that is true, then certainly the wordless picture book is vis­ual poetry. An artist of a wordless picture book must be meticulous, carefully using the tools of color and composition to elicit an emotional experience just as a poet uses words.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/books/review/marla-frazees-the-farmer-and-the-clown-and-more.html

2014-10-17,Inside the List,"Gotta Have Faith: Marilynne Robinson’s new novel, “Lila,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. It’s her fourth book to become a best seller, which is both heartening and a little weird — heartening because Robinson’s sentences are so polished and faceted and clear they could bend light; weird because most of her books engage deeply with the thornier aspects of Calvinist theology. (“She really is not like any other writer,” Cathleen Schine wrote, approvingly, in The New York Review of Books recently. “She really isn’t.”) Robinson first made the list in 2005 with her second novel, “Gilead,” which went on to win the Pulitzer and spent three months on the hardcover and paperback lists. It also laid the groundwork for both of her subsequent novels, which revisit the same characters and small-town setting. Robinson was as surprised as anyone when “Gilead” found a wide popular audience. “If you were to say to someone that you were to write a book about a minister dying in Iowa in 1956 and that he would spend a certain time on theological reflections, they would not think this was a book that would necessarily . . . sell,” she conceded to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005. Still, she found the success gratifying. “A Pulitzer Prize is very reassuring,” she told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, “and that’s a fact.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2014-10-17,"‘Just Mercy,’ by Bryan Stevenson","Unfairness in the Justice system is a major theme of our age. DNA analysis exposes false convictions, it seems, on a weekly basis. The predominance of racial minorities in jails and prisons suggests systemic bias. Sentencing guidelines born of the war on drugs look increasingly draconian. Studies cast doubt on the accuracy of eyewitness testimony.

What can you do? How can you dissuade his eye in a crowd from seeking out the cheek with acne, the infirm hand; how can you teach him to respond to the inestimable greatness of the race, the harsh surface beauty of life; how can you put his finger for him on the obdurate truths before which fear and horror are powerless?” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/books/review/paul-therouxs-mr-bones.html

Personally, when I discover I’m holding a smart novel that’s also a page turner, I get punchy. Not only have I spotted a unicorn; we are gamboling down the dale hand in hand.

To those of us who try to write for a living and couldn’t pass a science course, let alone teach one, such people are a little annoying. And now, not content with just poaching, Pin­ker has set himself up as a gamekeeper of sorts; he’s bringing out a manual, telling the rest of us how writing ought to be done. The title, “The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century,” suggests it’s even meant to supplant that classic text “The Elements of Style,” by Will Strunk and E. B.

A tall, lean guy who lives in cowboy boots and T-shirts from vintage-band concerts, Virgil wears his blond hair “country-long like Waylon Jennings.” He leaves the big-time crime-busting to his boss in Minneapolis, Lucas Davenport (“not a bad guy, though a trifle intense”), so he can grab the fun assignments for himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/books/review/john-sandfords-deadline-and-more.html

We start by traveling to two very different locales: Tangier, where we visit Yves Saint Laurent’s stunning final home, Villa Mabrouka; and Shanghai, where we stroll the Bund — and take a few selfies — with the wisecracking designer Michael Kors. Next, we look at a pair of celebrities on different ends of the career spectrum: the newly minted megastar actor Channing Tatum, who makes time in his busy schedule to indulge his secret passion, sculpture; and the rock icon Stevie Nicks, who doles out wisdom (and some moon pendants) to the rising girl band Haim at her home in Los Angeles. And in two of our most ambitious stories of the past decade, we worked with 15 renowned artists and 15 famous authors. We asked the artists (Barbara Kruger, Francesco Vezzoli and others) to get creative in the form of self-promotional advertisements, and the authors (Zadie Smith, James Patterson and others) to pool their talents for a collaborative original story. Elsewhere, Richard Rodriguez pens an essay on what it means to be naked in the digital age; Tim Wu investigates the roots of modern-day mindfulness practices in California wine country; and Gideon Lewis-Kraus travels to the remote Italian island of Stromboli to check out one of art’s oddest — and most volcanic — residencies.

Yet now, in the era of Sheryl Sandberg-styled corporate-conference feminism and leaning in — an option you don’t get to exercise in a kitchen at a Taco Bell, where you will only lean closer to the grill — it is easy to feel nostalgic for a time when a prominent face of the women’s movement could emerge from the fringe world of downtown Manhattan theater, rather than the neutered boardrooms of Silicon Valley.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/nyregion/when-living-on-tips-means-putting-up-with-harassment.html

2014-10-20,What’s on TV Saturday,"6:50 P.M. (Cinemax) HER (2013) Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a melancholic writer who composes personal letters for others, finds solace during his separation from his wife in the voice of Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the operating system who rouses him in the morning, bids him good night and organizes his life in between — without complaining as a real woman might, of course. But soon enough, Theodore and his software are headed toward becoming lovers. “It’s crucial that each time you hear Ms. Johansson in ‘Her,’ you can’t help but flash on her lush physicality, too, which helps fill in Samantha and give this ghostlike presence a vibrant, palpable form, something that would have been trickier to pull off with a lesser-known performer,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed and written by Spike Jonze, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay. “ 'Her’ is even harder to imagine without Mr. Phoenix, an actor who excels at exquisite isolation.” Ms. Dargis added: “This is a movie you want to reach out and caress, about a man who, like everyone else around him in this near future, has retreated from other people into a machine world. In ‘Her,’ the great question isn’t whether machines can think, but whether human beings can still feel.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

In 2004, the group’s second studio album, the histrionic but hooky “Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge,” set it apart from the pop-punk Warped Tour bands they had toured alongside when they began their career.

2014-10-20,Wrapped in Complexity,"The sculptures of Judith Scott, cocoonlike bundles of yarn, fabric and found objects, look perfectly on-trend in their devotion to fiber art and assemblage. But Ms. Scott (1943-2005) was not trying to insert herself into any particular contemporary-art conversation. She was born with Down syndrome, was largely deaf and mute, and spent 35 years in an Ohio institution. In 1987, her twin sister, Joyce, introduced her to the Creative Growth program for artists with developmental disabilities in Oakland, Calif., where she spent the rest of her life making art. “Judith Scott: Bound and Unbound,” opening Friday at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, celebrates her intriguing wrapped sculptures and the disability-rights movement that brought them to prominence. It asks some tough questions about the art world’s handling of artists with disabilities, challenging us to unravel Ms. Scott’s tightly wound creations without looking for a biographical thread.

That time-honored theater where hope, hormones and insecurity meet on the dance floor, where opposing sexes preen and peacock and face off against each other. This game of emotional and sexual hide-and-seek inspired Pina Bausch, one of the great 20th-century choreographers, throughout her career. Her 1978 work “Kontakthof,” which translates to “courtyard of contact,” is considered one of her first, and perhaps her most insightful, works to investigate that theme. In it, men in tuxes and women in silky pastels occupy a dance hall where they alternatively ignore and harass one another. (It has been performed by casts of high school students and people in their golden years, to underscore the lifelong relevance.)

2014-10-20,What’s On TV Sunday,"7 P.M. (Syfy) BIRTH (2004) Anna, a young widow played by Nicole Kidman, above, becomes convinced that Sean (Cameron Bright) is the reincarnation of her husband. The trouble is, Sean is only 10. Lauren Bacall plays Anna’s mother in this mystery from Jonathan Glazer; Danny Huston is her frustrated fiancé, and Anne Heche is the sister-in-law with secrets. “The film’s delicate mood of indeterminacy rests on his shoulders, or rather in his smooth, inscrutable face,” A. O. Scott wrote of Mr. Bright in The New York Times. “His character represents a premise that is absurd, even ridiculous, but for ‘Birth’ to work, it must be addressed with utter seriousness, even solemnity. And somehow, in Mr. Glazer’s hands, it does work. The hushed, claustrophobic ambience of high privilege and repressed feeling occasionally cracks, as this horror movie reveals itself also to be a rich, agonizing melodrama and a dry comedy of manners set in a fantasy Manhattan of crème caramel wainscoting and black-tie evenings at the opera.” Of Ms. Kidman, he added, “she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/arts/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

The airborne sequences are particularly compelling, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “When Hiccup first climbs on Toothless’s back and urges the dragon to take wing, the hearts of the audience soar with a primitive and durable delight,” he said. “The techniques that enabled this feeling may be dauntingly complicated, but the feeling could not be simpler.” At the beginning and the end, “ ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ is noisy and action-packed in the usual way,” Mr. Scott added, with “eye-straining, ear-popping large-scale effects.” But they are worth sitting through, he said, “for the tenderness, beauty and exhilaration that are the movie’s great strengths.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

It is hoped that Great Britain will be able to make good her case for the seizure. The right of Great Britain to insist that ships acquired by Americans be used strictly in neutral trade, and not to help late owners, is regarded as undoubted. The Brindillo is a German oil-tank steamer, now flying the American flag. She was captured by the cruiser Suffolk and taken into Halifax, N.S., by the armed cruiser Caronia.  — The New York Herald, European Edition, Oct. 21, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/1914-seizure-of-oil-steamer-interests-united-states/

2014-10-21,What’s on TV Tuesday,"7:30 P.M. (FX) ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER (2012) In this adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith’s comic novel, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) wages war, à la Buffy, on a vampire army of white Southerners whose cause is the enslavement of humans and not states’ rights. Anthony Mackie (above, with Mr. Walker) plays Will, the friend whom Lincoln saved as a child from the whip of a slaver (Marton Csokas), who took his revenge by killing Lincoln’s mother. His father died soon after. Dominic Cooper is Henry Sturges, the enigma who taught the orphaned Abe the Way of the Vampire Kill. “Outside of Nazis and zombies or, better yet, Nazi zombies, nothing says easily disposable villains like slave-trading vampires,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov. “And there is, no question, something satisfying — as the pleasure of the story’s pop conceit hits your deep historical outrage — about watching Lincoln decapitate a slave-trading ghoul, at least the first few dozen times. If only Mr. Bekmambetov had a strong sense of narrative rhythm and proportion, and as great a commitment to life as he does to death and all the ways bodies can be digitally pulverized.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

2014-10-21,Can You Uber a Burger?,"In the spring of 2009, when New York was consumed by a frenzy for extravagant hamburgers, one of the most coveted was the $26 Black Label burger, perhaps smeared with a dab of bone marrow, at the recently revamped Minetta­ Tavern in Greenwich Village. For most civilians, their best hope of devouring one of these funky, dry-aged meat pucks was to arrive promptly at 5:30 p.m. and wait — perhaps for hours, as I once did — until a table opened. For the select few, however, there was a shortcut. Keith McNally, the restaurant’s proprietor, has long maintained a private reservation line for esteemed regulars and V.I.P.s, who were ranked in their worthiness from A to AAA. For them, a $26 burger — and a table for two at 7:30 p.m. at which to engorge it — was only a phone call away.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/can-you-uber-a-burger.html

In the first bit of role playing, one student was told to make it clear, in an easygoing way, that he or she wants to go out. The recipient of the invitation was told that he or she also wants to go but has a paper due. “How can you show enthusiasm while still turning down the invitation?” a prompt on a card asked. The answer generally wasn’t hard to convey or, for the freshmen watching, to interpret. Most students found that they knew how to demur while keeping the door open for next time.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/hooking-up-at-an-affirmative-consent-campus-its-complicated.html

This became apparent on Monday morning when the company announced its earnings, missing analysts’ expectations by a wide margin.

Samuel, who died in 1996 at the age of 92, began commissioning furniture and objects in the late 1960s from artists like César, Guy de Rougemont and Philippe Hiquily, who used materials such as brass and smoked Plexiglas to create a blend of sculpture and furniture. Until then, he had flirted with the art world — he was close to Balthus, with whom he traded sofas for paintings — but never to such an extent. De Rougemont’s Nuage table, for instance, and Hiquily’s beaten brass chairs, had the shocking effect of real modernism. The interior designer Jacques Grange worked for Samuel early on, and describes an office atmosphere that was very formal and structured. “That was the place where I really learned what quality is,” he says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/henri-samuel-demisch-danant-gallery/

Yet somehow as a Brandeis sophomore I had made my way to be a finalist for the Washington Post internship. It must have been my essay. And there I was sitting at Ben Bradlee’s right hand in a Boston restaurant surrounded by other finalists, all of whom went to Harvard, were working on The Crimson, and had dazzling credentials. By the time lunch was over, I was sure I was no longer in the running. But as I got up to leave, Ben placed his hand on my arm and asked me if I had a few minutes to talk. A half-hour passed. He asked me what I thought of the Vietnam War. I remember telling him I was torn. He seemed pleased by my confusion. We talked about writing. I honestly don’t remember what else we talked about except that when we parted I knew what I wanted to do — I wanted to work for him.

A rumor also circulated that the emerald green Gulf water was a notch above the Mediterranean. That’s still up for debate, but what is not is that Naples is having its moment. The city is distinctly orderly, with landscaping reminiscent of Japanese gardens and “Truman Show” -level cleanliness on the streets. Naples is often overshadowed by its splashier cousin to the East (that would be Miami). But it has a vibrant downtown flush with high-end accouterments — a luxury pet boutique, a fancy popcorn store, top-notch ethnic and seafood restaurants, art galleries and a relaxed, good-time feeling (most evident when sampling the night life) — along with natural beauty that ranges from lush wetlands to white-sand beaches.

(Published by Toon Books, the New Yorker art director Françoise Mouly’s venture into richly illustrated books for children, it comes in two formats, with an oversize one that includes an afterword about the evolution of the tale.) All the well-chosen detail provides an ideal backdrop for what Gaiman and Mattotti have done with the Grimm Brothers’ familiar story of the two siblings who, after being abandoned by desperate parents, outwit their witchy captor.

2014-10-23,The Man Who Loved Photographs ,"Not so long ago, photography was dismissed by the art world as nothing more than a utilitarian medium. In the mid-1970s, a photograph by Edward Weston, an early 20th-century master of optical precision, could be had for less than $200 (roughly $800 today). On Sept. 29, Weston’s “Nautilus Shell, 1927,” a print small enough to hold in one hand, was auctioned at Christie’s for $461,000, an apt barometer of photography’s migration to the realm of high art. Cindy Sherman is a reigning example: At its evening sale of postwar and contemporary art on Nov. 12, Christie’s hopes to sell 21 “Untitled Film Stills” in a single lot for an estimated $6 million to $9 million; images by Ms. Sherman, Andreas Gursky and Jeff Wall have already sold for several million dollars each.

2014-10-23,What’s on TV Thursday,"9:55 A.M. (Starz) THE LUNCHBOX (2014) When a delivery service sends the lunch intended for her husband astray, a neglected Mumbai housewife (Nimrat Kaur) finds herself communicating through handwritten letters and home-cooked meals with a widowed office worker (Irrfan Khan) nearing retirement in Ritesh Batra’s debut feature. “This is not a new conceit,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, citing “You’ve Got Mail” and “The Shop Around the Corner.” “But the idea of two lonely souls connecting in a vast, modern metropolis, and remaining strangers even as their intimacy grows, has a durable charm. As do Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaur, islands of melancholy calm surrounded by silliness and noise. Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore. And Mr. Batra makes their story touching and credible, an urban fable of hope in the face of disappointment.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Representatives of the United Nations did not attend the hearing convened by Judge J. Paul Oetken of Federal District Court.

A lawyer for the United States Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, Ellen Blain, argued for a dismissal because of the United Nations’ “absolute” immunity under diplomatic treaties. Judge Oetken did not issue a ruling, and Mr. Concannon said it could be months. A separate lawsuit against the United Nations by Haitian cholera victims is pending in Brooklyn federal court.

People packed the theater night after night, some fainting after witnessing Richard Mansfield’s performance, which included an extraordinary onstage transformation from monster to doctor. This appetite for gore as entertainment spawned a major industry in print, theater and artifacts in 19th-century England.

2014-10-24,Inside the List,"Underdog: The Man Booker Prize is on a hot streak — Richard Flanagan’s novel “The Narrow Road to the Deep North,” new at No. 10 in hardcover fiction, is the ninth consecutive winner to make our list. (Which of those was most successful? At 38 weeks in hardcover and paperback, Hilary Mantel’s “Wolf Hall” edges out Anne Enright’s “The Gathering,” at 37 weeks.) Asked recently how he felt about this year’s decision to include Americans in the Booker running, which was previously limited to writers from Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth, Flanagan (who is Australian) sounded serene. “In an age where the razor wire is being rolled out everywhere,” he told The Guardian, “it’s being ripped away with this prize, and what was a great English prize is become a great English-language prize.” Then again, maybe he was just dazed. “The strange thing is that I haven’t had time to feel anything,” he told The Wall Street Journal after his victory, which he acknowledged came as a surprise. “I had friends who were true gamblers bet against me,” he said. “My mother bet on me and she did all right, but she’s my mother.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/books/review/inside-the-list.html

It makes for a strange bedtime story, and along with several of the chapters that follow, it’s threaded with a confusing tangle of details about the town’s history. But once O’Dell flashes forward to the present day, it’s clear the Nellies’ execution has left a permanent bruise on the soul of Lost Creek, a bruise its residents are still trying to heal through talk.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/tawni-odells-one-of-us-and-more.html

In “The Immortal Evening” (the phrase is from Haydon’s letters and diaries), the poet and biographer Stanley Plumly offers an idiosyncratic, heartfelt, at once sinuous and expansive exploration of the dinner, its “aesthetic context and the larger worlds of the individual guests, particularly the three ‘immortal’ writers, Keats, ­Wordsworth and Lamb.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/the-immortal-evening-by-stanley-plumly.html

Each roommate represents a different era. Mr. Waititi’s character, Viago, is a fastidious dandy with a Nazi past, and Mr. Clement’s Vladislav the Poker is a bloodthirsty orgiast. Rounding out the foursome are Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), the rambunctious baby of the group, and Petyr (Ben Fransham), its grouchy, antisocial senior member.

2014-10-27,Turkey: MERS Virus Case Is Reported," The potentially fatal MERS virus that originated in Saudi Arabia two years ago has spread to Turkey for the first time, the World Health Organization said Friday. In a report on its website, the organization attributed the spread to a 42-year-old Turkish citizen who had been working in the Saudi city of Jidda; he fell ill there last month and flew two weeks ago to the Turkish city of Hatay, where he was hospitalized and died within days. The organization said medical investigators confirmed that the man had suffered from MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and they were checking others in Turkey and Saudi Arabia who had been in contact with him during his symptomatic phase. Saudi Arabia has been under enormous pressure to control the disease, which can incubate in camels and other livestock. The Saudi authorities have been faulted for having allowed MERS to proliferate, particularly in Jidda, Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and the holy city of Mecca, where pilgrims from the entire world converge for the annual hajj. Pilgrims are known to have spread the disease to Iran, Jordan and Algeria. The W.H.O. said that as of Friday, it had tallied 883 MERS cases worldwide, including at least 319 deaths. Most cases are in Saudi Arabia. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/turkey-mers-virus-case-is-reported.html

2014-10-27,Bill Cunningham | Paying Respects,"Is there an appropriate code of dress for memorial services today? On Saturday, Oct. 18, a group of very elegant people entered St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue. It turned out to be a memorial service for Eileen Ford, a founder of the modeling agency named for her, who died in July. The spectacle of the nearly 500 decorously dressed people at the memorial service was in sharp contrast to the mixed-up looks of today’s fashion, even at funerals. For some, a dash of mauve, red or white on black, or a spectrum of grays was an appropriate approach. The clothes reflected what Mrs. Ford brought to the industry, which was a sense of decorum. On Monday, farther up Fifth Avenue, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a preview of its elegant small exhibition “Death Becomes Her: A Century of Mourning Attire,” with all the rigid rules of 19th-century mourning dress. And after the announcement of Oscar de la Renta’s death Monday evening, at benefit dinners during the week some women wore their own Oscars in honor of the designer, bottom center.

2014-10-27,What’s on TV Saturday,"7 P.M. (HBO Signature) THE CONJURING (2013) Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life paranormal investigators who declared an infamous Dutch colonial-style house on Long Island haunted, leading to the many “Amityville” movies. Their target this time is a Rhode Island farmhouse, where the blissful dreams of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Tayor and Ron Livingston, above, with Mr. Wilson, right) and their five daughters become a moaning, creaking nightmare when they find themselves playing cat-and-mouse with an evil force. The director, James Wan, “smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “That gives the movie a shiver of political currency, even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, they’re facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that aren’t much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker. It’s here.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

But when the coach arrives hours later with a hysterical Lydia inside, and the men missing, a search party ensues. P. D. James wrote the 2011 novel from which this two-part “Masterpiece Mystery!” production is adapted. “The two most famous argumentative lovers of post-Shakespearean literature are played here,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times, “with skill, intelligence and a bit too much restraint.” The most vivid performance, he added, is given by Ms. Coleman, “the current companion on ‘Doctor Who’ — she’s so squeally and broad as Lydia, Elizabeth’s youngest sister and Wickham’s wife, that she seems to be in a different, less distinguished and possibly more entertaining show.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

Zombies — not the Afro-Caribbean variety, controlled by a shaman, but the mindless, flesh-eating dead injected into American popular culture by the filmmaker George Romero with his 1968 film, “Night of the Living Dead” — are most often the opposite: slow, mindless, shambling, putrid excrescences in a state of perpetual decay.

Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan and Claire Rushbrook play Cynthia’s brother, sister-in-law and daughter, who have secrets of their own. “In a performance that lurches thrillingly from grief to comedy to compassion, never losing its tart humor, her Cynthia rises up from the sodden mess of her life to face regret over the past and uncharacteristic hope for the future,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about Ms. Blethyn, who along with Ms. Jean-Baptiste and Mr. Leigh received Oscar nominations. “Soap opera?” Ms. Maslin asked. “Never. Mr. Leigh’s wry and magnanimous intelligence keeps ‘Secrets & Lies’ determinedly unsentimental, helped immeasurably by Cynthia’s fine, tough resilience and idiomatic verve.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2014-10-28,What’s on TV Tuesday,"9 P.M. (MoreMax) NON-STOP (2014) An air marshal (Liam Neeson), consumed by heartache and a complicated past, tries to outwit a villain on a flight from New York to London who has vowed to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account. In this thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, Lupita Nyong’o, Linus Roache and Shea Whigham add to the suspense in their roles as prospective heroes or villains. And while the movie doesn’t always make sense, that’s “incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “A lot has been written about Mr. Neeson’s surprising resurrection as an older action hero, which has sometimes been more rewarding theoretically than cinematically. Mr. Collet-Serra, however, makes good on that promise with a sure genre hand and real feeling for what Mr. Neeson brings to the screen at this stage of his career, including beauty etched by time and a still-imposing body that moves with the heaviness and grandeur of an old warrior raising his sword one last time. When Mr. Neeson runs through the aisles, he can sometimes seem too big for this vehicle, even if he turns out to be exactly right.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

On any bright morning between roughly 400 A.D.

The usefulness of an ingredient existed on a temporal spectrum, with differing but comparable values at both ends; this was intrinsic kitchen knowledge, guided by recipes in cookbooks like Lydia Maria Francis Child’s “The American Frugal Housewife” (1832), or Marion Harland’s “Common Sense in the Household” (1871), or Fannie Farmer’s “Boston Cooking-School Cook Book” (1896).",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/magazine/in-cooking-good-ingredients-gone-bad-can-still-be-delicious.html

If you look at developments in all the other fields — visual, theater, music, architecture — everything is moving toward the interdisciplinary; and the interdisciplinary is the kernel of what opera is.” Sharon, who is 35, leads the Industry, which in its four years as an experimental opera company has staged productions that “move opera away from the fixed experience of proceedings.” In fact, he says, his projects are actively “immersive and participatory — your experience is prioritized.” That might sound like buzzy lip service in a post-“Sleep No More” performance landscape, but the Industry’s bona fides back up its ambitious mission statement. The company, which is based in Los Angeles (“a city that has always been a frontier for new explorations,” Sharon notes), has commissioned and produced three operas to date, all of which have been site-specific enterprises that reimagine the roles of both the performers and the audience. “Invisible Cities,” based on Italo Calvino’s postmodern book of the same name, has received the most acclaim; its composer, Christopher Cerrone, was a finalist for a 2014 Pulitzer Prize.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/invisible-cities-opera-yuval-sharon-the-industry/

After Hurricane Sandy hit, Bettany never saw them again. “I’m not a religious man, but I grew up a Catholic, and my father always used to say to me, ‘There but for the grace of God go I,'” Bettany says. He was keen to explore the disparity between that sense of empathy and what he sees as today’s dismissive view of homelessness. “Now there’s this sort of slightly aggressive response,” he says. “This idea that you must have done something to bring yourself this low, and you’re responsible for it.” In their research for “Shelter,” Bettany and his wife, Jennifer Connelly, who stars in the film, became involved with the organization Coalition for the Homeless; tomorrow they will be honored at its annual ArtWalk gala, hosted by Dolce & Gabbana, at which works from such artists as Cindy Sherman, Chuck Close and Louise Bourgeois will be auctioned off.

And at one point, he even brought on a fisherman, but not to help cast lines and bring in a big one; the sportsman instead fixed a broken strobe light Baron needed in order to get the right shot (“the way you shoot the icebergs is at night, to make them even more monumental than they were before,” he explains).",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/t-magazine/fabien-baron-tundra-monuments-project.html

(Chefs at Phoenix Sky Harbor International think so highly of their food they’re pushing to host a James Beard Foundation dinner at the airport next year.)

My friend, also an expat, was diagnosed with H.I.V. while living here. She received almost no support or therapy of any form. Her attitude and behavior changed as she became ill, and she alienated and frustrated mutual friends. While I knew the truth, I was entrusted with her secret and stayed silent when I heard people bad-mouth her. Now that she has returned home, I feel compelled to defend her honor — I believe she was judged too harshly given unfathomable pressure and circumstances. But I also feel obligated to hold on to her secret. Is it acceptable to divulge a secret to protect someone’s honor?

He and his cronies were taken to Munich’s Stadelheim prison, where they were shot on the spot — except for Röhm, whose execution occurred shortly thereafter. Similar raids took place that night against other SA leaders, who were charged, like Röhm, with having planned a coup against Hitler and his government. In reality, this “Night of the Long Knives” was the violent end to power struggles between Hitler and the army officer corps on the one hand, and Röhm, as the head of roughly two million paramilitary storm troopers, on the other. They had challenged Hitler’s absolute leadership and also the professional officer corps’s claim to be the sole bearer of arms in Nazi Germany.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/books/review/gay-berlin-by-robert-beachy.html

2014-10-31,"‘The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science,’ by Armand Marie Leroi","Armand Marie Leroi is a scientist, and Aristotle is his hero. This conjunction is interesting because, in the official telling of modern science’s origins, Aristotle is hardly regarded as heroic. Instead he’s portrayed as the obstacle over which the early heroes of the scientific revolution — Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo — had to leap in order to impose a genuinely explanatory methodology over the often deceptive input of sense perception. After all, what could be clearer to the senses than that the Earth is stationary and the heavens revolve around it? If there was any ancient whom these pioneers of modern science esteemed it was Plato. He, too, had emphasized the deceptiveness of appearances. What’s more he had suggested, however obliquely, most especially in his “Timaeus,” that mathematics reveals the true structure of the cosmos, offering us the means by which we can distinguish between reliable and unreliable appearances. So, at least, did men like Galileo read the “Timaeus,” finding insights there to topple the formidable edifice of a Church-fortified Aristotelianism. The new scientists discarded at least two of the four Aristotelian causes, the formal and the final, the latter having injected a pernicious teleology into all physical explanations. (Flames leap and rocks fall because their constituent elements are striving to get to their right places.) In place of Aristotle’s qualitative categories, the new scientists put quantitative descriptions of matter in motion. What Aristotle had sundered, the celestial and the terrestrial, were united under one mechanics.

And they love celebrating that story. But we have an innocent African-American man being sent to death row for a crime he didn’t commit, and there’s no consciousness about that. . . . One of the most powerful things for me in this book was trying to get people to appreciate that we have a criminal justice system that treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. I’m not trying to beat up on people who are wealthy, but I want us to understand if we’re really committed to justice, we’ve got to do better for the poor than we’re doing.

2014-10-31,1914: Hospital-Ship Lost Off Coast,"LONDON — In a terrific gale on the north-east coast this morning, the British hospital-ship Rohilla, bound for Belgium, ran on the rocks at Whitby and became a total wreck. The Rohilla had on board a staff of doctors and nurses who had just set out on their errand of mercy, together with a large crew. The seas were so heavy that the ship’s boats were smashed immediately after being lowered. Some persons aboard were rescued by lifeboats but eighty are still on the wreck, according to the latest news received to-day, enormous seas preventing their rescue. Several bodies have been washed ashore. A telegram received early this morning says: ‘‘The Whitby boat is disabled and the Scarborough lifeboat, in tow of a tug, is unable to approach sufficiently near to effect a rescue. Now late at night the middle of the vessel is the only portion remaining, the stem and stern having both parted. Those crowded in the dismembered portion appear to be doomed, for, so far as can be seen, no human aid can be extended to them.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, Nov. 1, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/1914-hospital-ship-lost-off-coast/

The hope is that you will be transported by these ideas and images, whether or not you plan on making any of the journeys our writers undertook — going, for instance, from London to Venice aboard the luxurious Orient Express. A pair of mystery author friends realize that the train’s original luxury, speed, has been replaced by the more contemporary luxury of time. (It takes two days to cover what would be a two-hour flight.) Those days are spent in close quarters with strangers, liveried staff and the authors’ own imaginations. More energetically, our critic at large Jody Rosen heads to Bhutan, a country where the royal family’s passion for bicycling might just rival Buddhism as the path to nirvana. Perhaps it’s no surprise that the place that engendered the concept of Gross National Happiness should also endorse a more scenic, wind-in-your-face form of getting from A to B. Closer to home — or at least to the home of the photographer Bruce Weber — a shack on the beach provides the fantasylike backdrop to a fashion shoot that evokes the freedom and beauty of youth, as captured by the teenagers Jean Campbell, a new model, and Brooklyn Beckham, child of David and Victoria. The pictures conjure a sense of the carefree idealism in those long summer days between childhood and adulthood, which — however far away those things might seem — we ought not to lose if we can help it. It is some aspect of that feeling we seek to capture in any vacation by the sea.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/great-escapism/

That miss starts, in a certain way, with the very title and theme of the synod, and it’s a failure that implicates both the Catholic right and the Catholic left, whose shared focus on explicitly familial and sexual relationships may be crowding out Christian ideas, and Christian models of community and religious life, that the modern world is going to need, perhaps desperately, if current trends in social life persist.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/the-synod-and-the-single-catholic/

As warblers go, this species is just a little larger, a little heavier and a little bulkier than its kin. They can be downright abundant in the late fall landscape, darting through the thinning tree branches, or even shaking off the season’s first snowflakes. The yellow-rumped warbler (Setophaga coronata) overwinters farther north than any other North American wood warbler, and is very hardy. Butter butts, as birders call them because of the bright yellow patch above their tails, are just beginning to show up in our local woodlands as their passerine brethren abandon the cold Northeast for the warmth of Central and South America. The birds are official New Yorkers throughout the winter months.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/meet-the-butter-butt-one-tough-bird/
