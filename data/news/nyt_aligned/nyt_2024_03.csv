Today, he makes brightly colored, highly animated papier-mâché face coverings that he builds by layering strips of recycled newspaper dipped in a flour, water and salt paste over Plasticine forms. “The first one I made was two guys cheek to cheek,” he says of the masks, which have been shown at galleries — he had a solo show at La Luz de Jesus in Los Angeles this past fall — and are sold online.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/t-magazine/papier-mache-art-crafts.html

2024-03-04,‘Hot Sheet’ Lays Out Sweet and Savory Recipes for Sheet-Pan Devotees,"Some cutting-edge appliances like the air fryer may have risen in popularity lately, but the simple sheet pan has become as essential as a cast-iron skillet. In the past, the sheet pan was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used in kitchens to make the cake known as chocolate roulade; it’s now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sanaë Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, “Hot Sheet,” you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point. As for a clafoutis, a pie plate works just fine. Photos of well-used pans with their smudges of dark residue might resonate with home cooks.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/dining/hot-sheet-cookbook-sheet-pan.html

For the preceding two and a half million years, through the Pleistocene Epoch, the planet’s climate fluctuated between frozen stretches, called glacials, and warm interglacials. At that time, Earth was warming again, and the ice sheets that covered much of North America, Europe and Asia were in retreat. Mammoths, steppe bison, wild horses and other enormous mammals still wandered the Americas, pursued by bands of humans wielding spears with fluted stone blades. Suddenly, somewhere over the Upper Midwest — an explosion. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/magazine/younger-dryas-impact-hypothesis-comet.html

While living at the Ritz Hotel with a handsome German spy, she had tried to use the Nazi race laws to wrest control of her perfume company from her Jewish partners. She also had embarked on a Nazi-authorized scheme to broker a separate peace with Winston Churchill, and she was overheard making ugly, antisemitic remarks.",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/style/the-new-look-coco-chanel.html

2024-03-05,"If You Close It, Will They Come?","You’ll be able to dine at this pair of new restaurants about as often as you receive your electric bill. Marc Murphy, who is opening Marc179, his first restaurant since 2019, will serve dinners three nights each month in the TriBeCa building that had housed Landmarc and which he uses for private events, TV and photo shoots. “Smaller works for me,” Mr. Murphy said. “I’ve missed interacting with the public and this allows me to be there.” He has redone the space with skylights and seating for 64, and will serve a four-course menu, $75. It will change monthly; the lineup for March is arugula salad, bucatini cacio e pepe, roast chicken breast with mushrooms, and chocolate mousse. A brief wine list of half and whole bottles is gently priced with a bottle of Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Chablis for $38, a bottle of Mas de Daumas Gassac cabernet sauvignon for $65, a half-bottle of Ridge Lytton Springs zinfandel for $42, and a half-bottle of Krug Grand Cuvée for $110. “I’ve gone from six restaurants and 650 employees to just four, and I can make money here,” Mr. Murphy said. When not serving dinners, the space houses his events company, MM Kitchen Studio. (Opens March 7, 8, 9) Then there’s Dan Kluger with Greywind, a complex near Hudson Yards that has a restaurant, a bar called Spygold and a bakery that becomes the Chef’s Counter three evenings a month. “I need to be there, but I don’t want to take on too much,” Mr. Kluger said. “The space is also used for private events so I can’t overcommit.” The counter has seats for eight people and offers about six courses with various themes, changing each month, with vegetables and proteins in tandem, $185 at 5:45 and 8:15 p.m. Last week’s menu included leek terrine with potato soup and trout roe, and chicken “oyster” with oyster mushrooms.

The man’s body shook with a wild tremor that nearly knocked him down again. “I was getting into bed and fell,” he explained — though the bed was too far away to make this at all likely. “Get some sleep,” the woman said gently once her husband was settled in the bed. “We’ll go to the hospital in the morning.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/magazine/bismuth-toxicity-pepto-bismol.html

Then there’s art that seems like somebody thawed it after 30 frozen years. “Glitter & Doom” doesn’t yearn for some older time. It’s pure time-warp: a gay musical-love-dramedy that could’ve screened all summer at the old Philadelphia art house where I used to work, plunked amid the queer independent-filmmaking bonanza that helped make the early-to-mid-1990s seem like every gay thing was possible. The movie’s got an earnest, amateurish case of the feel-good gosh-gollies that would have made sense playing down the hall from movies as different (although not that different) as “Go Fish” and “Wigstock,” “Zero Patience” and “The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love” and — God help us all — “Claire of the Moon.” The two dozen or so songs in “Glitter & Doom” aren’t new (but aren’t based on Tom Waits’s 15-year-old live album, either). They’re by the Indigo Girls. Many of them are songs the Indigo Girls made a certain kind of popular during the years of that very bonanza.

Last week, City Hall and the Department of Transportation issued new guidelines for Dining Out NYC, its official program, and the largest such program in the country. “It’s been a priority for Mayor Adams from Day 1,” said Ya-Ting Liu, the city’s chief public realm officer. Restaurants and other establishments that serve food can now apply for permits to take part through an official portal online. Those that are approved and pay a fee for a four-year license ($1,050) for either a roadbed or sidewalk enclosure have 30 days to remove their temporary structures or outfit them to comply with the city’s rules. The authorized structures can remain in place from April through Nov. 29. Restaurants without approval will have to remove their sheds by Aug. 3; those with a pending application will have until Nov. 1. The city has approved four prototypes designed by WXY Studio to eliminate many of the problems with existing makeshift sheds and to adapt to various roadway and sidewalk configurations. They are being built by SITU, a fabrication company, and are already in place at several restaurants. They are not heated and will supposedly be rat-proof; some models are equipped with solar panels. At Bodrum, on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, Huseyin Ozer, an owner, said the 40-foot unit in the roadway outside his restaurant had planters, could be customized with signage, will allow for 16 seats and is easy to disassemble. Hinged floor panels lift to allow for cleaning.

In 1835, a 14-year-old Vuitton embarked — by foot — on a 280-mile, two-year pilgrimage to Paris, where he spent nearly two decades mastering the art of box making under the tutelage of a prominent malletier. Following his appointment as the official trunk maker for Napoleon III’s wife, Eugénie de Montijo, Vuitton opened his first luggage shop in 1854 near Place Vendôme, where he sold leather travel goods and canvas steamer trunks. Vuitton’s business was strong enough that in 1888, his only son, Georges, trademarked his now-signature checkerboard Damier print. The company’s steamer bag, which was intended to contain laundry on trans-Atlantic voyages, debuted in 1901; in the 1930s, the brand released the Keepall, a foldable tote, originally made from cotton canvas, that was small enough to be tucked into larger suitcases.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/t-magazine/pharrell-tyler-the-creator-louis-vuitton-bag.html

Our $2,132 itinerary took us from Minneapolis to Toronto to Dublin on tickets booked on United Airlines through Expedia but ultimately operated by Air Canada, a United partner. We had boarded our connecting flight in Toronto (and I was already dozing in my seat) when the captain announced an operator had crashed the jet bridge into the starboard engine. We were given hotel vouchers and told we would be rebooked for the next day. Checkout time came and went without a word, so we went to the airport and were told to call Air Canada customer service. An agent booked us a flight for that evening, and we printed out boarding passes at an airport kiosk. But when we tried to board, we were told the boarding passes were invalid. Eventually, we were offered two options for the next day: Fly to Dublin via Newark, or return to Minneapolis. We cut our losses and went home after staying the night in Toronto at a hotel. But United refunded us only $1,087, barely half of what we paid. Air Canada did reimburse us for the second hotel and other expenses, but we believe the airlines owe us not only a full refund, but also 400 Canadian each ($295 apiece) under Canadian law for denied boarding.

After all, the president called for at least a temporary cease-fire, laying out, in his most emotional terms to date, the losses and suffering of the people of Gaza and delivered an unmistakably sharp signal that Israel must make the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza a priority. Those calls came on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris’s high-profile meeting with Benny Gantz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rival and likely successor — a snub to Mr. Netanyahu who has been denied a White House visit.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/opinion/biden-israel-gaza-policy.html

I felt a little better when we stepped inside the Dogwood Acres Pet Retreat. The lobby, with its elegant tiled entrance, might have passed for the lobby of any small countryside hotel, at least one that strongly favored dog-themed décor. But this illusion was broken when the receptionist reviewed our reservation — which, in addition to our luxury suite, included cuddle time, group play, a nature walk and a “belly rub tuck-in.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/magazine/luxury-dog-hotels.html

In 2008, the artist began hand-making everyday dinnerware in her home studio in Carroll Gardens, decorating the pieces with floral motifs in a cobalt stain. Black irises, poppies and flowering quince from her garden adorned vases, shallow banchan dishes and scalloped serving trays. Her new Poppy and Cherry collections, which were fired in a gas kiln for 12 to 15 hours, channel Dutch Delftware while depicting local flora. “I have a wall that separates my garden from my neighbor’s, and I’ve interwoven quince in it,” Goldstein says. “I’m very into blooming trees.” From $65, mgbyhand.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/t-magazine/mg-by-hand-porcelain-dinnerware.html

This closet, which has become a sacred space for movie buffs, was once a disused bathroom at the headquarters of the Criterion Collection, a 40-year-old company dedicated to “gathering the greatest films from around the world” and making high-quality editions available to the public on DVD and Blu-ray and, more recently, through its streaming service, the Criterion Channel. Today Criterion uses the closet as its stockroom, housing films by some 600 directors from more than 50 countries — a catalog so synonymous with cinematic achievement that it has come to function as a kind of film Hall of Fame. Through a combination of luck, obsession and good taste, this 55-person company has become the arbiter of what makes a great movie, more so than any Hollywood studio or awards ceremony.",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/podcasts/the-daily/the-sunday-read-sure-it-won-an-oscar-but-is-it-criterion.html

Many artists amass their collections through trades: The walls in their spaces are a biography of their friendships, their peers, their mentors and students. I’ve always thought it was a great sign of respect and admiration to hang another artist’s work in your home; much as writers are delighted to discover their book on a fellow writer’s shelf, so, too, must artists feel a special thrill of professional recognition to encounter their work in the wild.

There was cheetah-print carpeting, tall potted palms and bathrooms with mirrored walls and black lacquer. Four years in, Johnson, 46, and Hovsepian, 49, who live with their 12-year-old son, Julius, and a dog named Bruno, have transformed the 5,800-square-foot space — with its vast 20-foot-tall living room and wall of casement windows that open onto a back garden — into a radically different sort of sanctuary. “Art is the center of our approach to everything,” says Johnson. “That’s where we put our energy.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/t-magazine/rashid-johnson-sheree-hovsepian-home.html

Moya was staying nearby, at the tumbledown hotel Torre di Bellosguardo, when he learned that another unlikely (and quite strange) residence had become available. It was in the area — the southwestern Florentine hills, quiet and almost suburban, where families have long purchased properties with views of the Duomo — so Moya decided to stop by. “Anyone who lives here looks at the market all the time,” he says over espresso one frosty December morning. “There’s nothing [available], really.

In the course of the next 50 years, he’d meet and marry the artist Marina Adams, who makes rhythmic large-scale paintings in vibrant jewel tones, and together, they’d raise their son, William — all in that loft. For decades, Whitney also used part of the 2,000-square-foot space as his studio, a room without natural light where he painted and drew his abstract works, including his signature gridlike compositions of startling, luminous colors: chlorine blue, taxicab yellow.

2024-03-21,Why ‘Uncle Vanya’ Is the Play for Our Anxious Era,"IN WATCHING MIXED-BREED dogs play, I’ve often thought that mutts are more dog than the purest purebred. They’re the essence of caninity, all mud, turf and wet fur. So, too, with dramatic works: Some are purebred — think of William Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” (1611) or Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (1962) — while others are mad rambles, off leash and messy. This brings me to Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” (1897), a singularly psychologically destabilizing piece of theater that’s now being seen anew as a study of post-Covid paralysis, not to mention the existential dread of watching your life slip away by the spoonful. Although first produced in Moscow in 1899, it feels just like our present American age, when nobody hears anybody else because listening hurts too much; when the most comforting activity imaginable is a long, solitary walk followed by an even longer interlude of silence. This is a drama about being driven insane by the sound of other people’s desires, complaints and aspirations when you’re already being tortured by your own. The pandemic and the boorish political and public discourse that followed drove us inward, unable to fight back, going nuts like poor Vanya.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/t-magazine/chekhov-uncle-vanya-heidi-schreck.html

The standard-bearer tends to be a pretty young thing who has enough life in her that you don’t want it or her snuffed out (well, usually). Sometimes she’s babysitting in suburbia; at other times she is tiptoeing around a mansion with dark secrets and groaning floorboards.

Not because it doesn’t work in a theater — horror almost always benefits from being seen in a crowd — but because its writer-director duo, the brothers Colin and Cameron Cairnes, make shrewd use of some of the uniquely creepy things about television, especially its intimacy. The TV set is in your house, and you’re sitting six feet away from it, and especially in the wee hours of the night, whatever’s staring back at you can feel eerie, or impertinent.

Helena, a wealthy older artist, has invited the narrator to stay indefinitely with her and her quiet teenage daughter, Olga. The trio quickly establishes a domestic idyll of swimming, cooking and wine. The narrator trains the spotlight of her obsession on Helena, who we gather is accustomed to hero worship. The spotlight will eventually shift to Olga.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/books/review/johansson-malye-howard-guild.html

2024-03-22,How Do You Build a Jungle?,"THE ARCHITECTS MARCIO Kogan and Renata Furlanetto of the Brazilian firm Studio MK27 had just broken ground on a new house in São Paulo in 2010 when the landscape designer Isabel Duprat informed them that they’d have to raise the entire 10,225-square-foot project, known as Casa Rampa, by almost 20 inches. The root system of a towering sibipiruna tree — a flowering giant native to the Atlantic rainforest ecosystem that once encompassed much of Brazil’s coast — extended farther into the plot than they’d thought. Maintaining the original position of the residence, a second home for a couple and their art collection, would mean fatally destabilizing the plant. “There were two options: You move the house, or the tree dies,” says Duprat, 69, on a temperate afternoon this past August, standing beneath its delicate bipinnate leaves.

Known for her immersive sound and video installations (she’s currently the subject of a show at the Fire Station in Doha, Qatar), Rist believes that the bag was one of the first human tools. With a bag, she says, “you have what you need and are independent — and you’re always ready for a possible escape.” But Rist, 61, also considers a bag to be many things besides: a good friend, a portrait of its owner, a universe unto itself and a vessel — similar to the human body. At its heart, Rist says, her collection is “a phenomenological investigation into how many bags come together when a 60-something-year-old Central European woman doesn’t throw anything away.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/t-magazine/pipilotti-rist-bag-collection.html

Ishkar, a London-based company that collaborates with NGOs and artisans to create job opportunities for those living in isolated areas of countries often affected by war, recently commissioned him to create a capsule collection with women weavers in Afghanistan. Barthélemy typically works with artisans in person to create tapestries or rugs but, since the Taliban retook power in 2021, he’s had to connect with the weavers remotely. At the start of their collaboration, Barthélemy asked the weavers to draw a place that symbolized beauty to them. Many of the women chose the 14th-century Bagh-e Babur (Babur’s Garden) in Kabul. Images from those drawings, and one by Barthélemy himself, were then combined to create the patterns for three different rugs. Each one took about six months for the women to hand knot from Ghazni Wool. They are, Barthélemy says, “a collective dream of an ancient paradise.” The rugs can be seen in London at Sunbury Workshops on Swanfield Street from April 24-26, and through September at the Ishkar flagship showroom; from about $4,000, ishkar.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/t-magazine/modernist-cement-zia-tile.html
