2014-02-03,Bloomberg Picked to Be Climate Envoy," Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has a new job: United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change. The United Nations secretary general’s office said Friday that Mr. Bloomberg would be responsible for nudging cities around the world to take steps to combat climate change, helping to “raise political will and mobilize action among cities” in the months before a climate summit meeting that is scheduled to take place in New York in September. The United Nations climate agenda has been entangled in arguments between rich and poor nations over who should more urgently take steps to reduce carbon emissions. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg set a citywide goal to slash emissions by 30 percent by 2030. He tried to penalize taxi owners who did not use fuel-efficient hybrid cars, but the courts blocked that effort in 2011, calling it a de facto regulation of emissions standards — a power that, under existing laws, belongs to the federal government. Reuters first reported the news of Mr. Bloomberg’s appointment early on Friday. “I can’t think of a person better suited for this important new role,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

2014-02-03,What’s On Saturday,"7:15 P.M. (HBO) EPIC (2013) The spirited 17-year-old daughter (Amanda Seyfried) of an eccentric scientist (Jason Sudeikis), trying to prove the existence of a nearly invisible kingdom, ventures into a lush forest and shrinks to two inches, the better to ride on the backs of hummingbirds, in this animated film inspired by William Joyce’s children’s book “The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.” There, she meets the leader of the Leafmen (above, voiced by Colin Farrell), an army of ecowarriors committed to saving their environment from the evil Boggans, who want to turn it into a wasteland. Beyoncé Knowles provides the voice for the Leafmen’s ruler, whose 100-year reign will end when a flower pod bursts under a full moon to reveal the new queen; Christoph Waltz is the leader of the Boggans, who cruise on flying rodents; and Steven Tyler is the distracted yellow caterpillar in charge of recording the forest’s history. “The gorgeous 3-D adventure comedy,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, “suggests a warmer, fuzzier ‘Avatar,’ with a green heart. Directed by Chris Wedge, the movie is a hymn to nature rendered in phantasmagoric detail as refined as anything I’ve seen in a computer-animated family film. But as beautiful as it is, ‘Epic’ is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge.” Still, he added, “for what it’s worth, ‘Epic’ is on the side of the angels.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

This is a case that has been written about endlessly, but this is the first time that Dylan Farrow herself has written about it in public. It’s important to note that Woody Allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence. So why publish an account of an old case on my blog? Partly because the Golden Globe lifetime achievement award to Allen ignited a debate about the propriety of the award. Partly because the root issue here isn’t celebrity but sex abuse. And partly because countless people on all sides have written passionately about these events, but we haven’t fully heard from the young woman who was at the heart of them. I’ve written a column about this, but it’s time for the world to hear Dylan’s story in her own words.)",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/

Our hope was to bring a new twist to celebrity portraiture and produce some unusual images. One of the actors cast for the “Dream House” portfolio was Philip Seymour Hoffman. He agreed to go up to Rutland on a Sunday in August. I remember thinking, as we were driving to meet up with him at our rendezvous in a shopping center parking lot, How will we know which car he is in? But there in the big empty lot, in one lone car smack in the middle of it, was a man reading The New York Times. Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to make an entrance.

The country’s constitutional monarchy has faced coups and street protests in the past, but it has been a model of relative stability and development in Southeast Asia, a region known for its autocratic and brutal governments. As an American treaty ally, Thailand has been critically important in helping to reduce regional tensions and provided balance to the growing military assertiveness of China by championing trade and economic integration partly through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Sunday, protesters disrupted the vote by blocking the distribution of ballot boxes to polling places in about 11 percent of the country’s electoral districts. Because Thailand’s Constitution requires that 95 percent of parliamentary seats be filled before a new government can be formed, the disruption means the country will remain in limbo for months as election authorities try to conduct elections in those districts where protesters prevented a vote from taking place.

2014-02-04,What’s On Tuesday,"10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) RUST AND BONE (2012) Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a former prizefighter fleeing with his young son (Armand Verdure) from a bad situation, arrives in Antibes, on the Côte d’Azur. At a club where he works as a bouncer, he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard, above, with Mr. Schoenaerts), a trainer for a Sea World-like amusement park. Then she loses her legs in an accident with a killer whale and calls him, thinking he might help rouse her from her despair. “A plot summary of ‘Rust and Bone’ might suggest a maudlin, therapeutic fable of healing, and in many ways — or, let’s say, in hindsight — the movie is just that,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But its conventional, sentimental essence (which is overtly revealed only at the end) is effectively complicated, indeed almost undone, by the jagged textures of the filmmaking and the naturalistic intensity of the performances.” He added: “The removal of Ms. Cotillard’s legs — including in scenes in which she wears a bathing suit or nothing — is surely one of the most impressive special-effects feats of the year, and a reminder that digital cinema is not all about accessorizing wizards, monsters and superheroes. But the greater marvel is Ms. Cotillard herself, an actress of limitless bravery and supernatural poise, who is both beauty and beast. Mr. Schoenaerts is her perfect foil and complement, as large and coarse as she is small and delicate, and also as tender as she is tough.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

2014-02-04,Bookshelf | Portraits of the Hudson Valley’s Creative Community,"When Pete Seeger died last week, folk music lost one of its greatest pioneers, but so, too, did the Hudson Valley. Seeger had called the bucolic area just north of New York City home since the late ’40s, when he spent $1,700 for 17 acres in Beacon. It was from his house there that Seeger began, in the ’60s, his crusade to clean up the polluted Hudson River via his environmental nonprofit, the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater. Seeger was inspired artistically throughout his lifetime by the force of the mighty, meandering river, and it was Seeger that the British graphic designer Nick Hand initially had in mind when he decided, in the spring of 2012, to log about 550 miles biking through the region to interview and photograph members of its artisan community.

Whatever the case, the old-school sweatpant, made modern with a slim cut and more refined fabrics, is now being heralded as the “new khaki.” Luxe versions of the stretch-waist pants are showing up on runways and in presentations in both Europe and New York, where the men’s shows continue this week. For his fall/winter 2014 collection, Michael Kors explained that he blended “New York City polish with the laid-back attitude of California,” and that he did away almost entirely with structured waistbands and belt loops. Made with double-faced cashmere or a more office-appropriate glen plaid, the newly refined track pant was the linchpin of Kors’s relaxed, elegant wardrobe. Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren introduced more sportswear styles under its Purple Label than ever before. A luxurious cashmere-knit jogging-style pant paired with a matching crew-neck sweater and trim topcoat stood in stark contrast to the nipped-waist suits that are at the heart of the tailored line, yet looked no less natty. And at Bottega Veneta, Tomas Maier paired belted coats, lightly tailored jackets and suede bombers with numerous iterations of the pull-on pant, from corduroy to cashmere, to signify his belief in this new trouser alternative.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/threes-a-trend-luxe-sweatpants/

2014-02-05,Whose Turkey Is It?,"It is still a marvel to behold Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s self-confidence, even after 11 years of his rule. In recent weeks, a new poster featuring Turkey’s prime minister has appeared throughout Istanbul, on highway billboards and mass transit. Wearing his usual dark suit, Erdogan looks to be in purposeful motion, like an action hero. Two large words in block letters, SAGLAM IRADE, Turkish for “Iron Will,” accompany him. Surely some of his supporters appreciate this evocation of 1930s-era masculinity, but for others, it must feel like an invasion of personal space. The enormous billboards intensify the claustrophobia that many Turks have felt for years: that Erdogan is everywhere, in every tree or open space sacrificed for a building, in every traffic jam, in every newspaper column and pro-government tweet and call to prayer. The poster, which a group of his supporters claims to have put up, begs to be defaced, and Turks have torn at it or covered it with new slogans: “Iron Fascist,” “Iron Corruption,” “Iron Enemy of the People.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/magazine/whose-turkey-is-it.html

2014-02-06,Temporary Insanity,"For eight days in February and then again in September, more than 100,000 characters descend on New York City for the women’s fashion shows. Traffic grinds to a halt. Requests on Uber, the luxury car-service app, spike 40 percent. It’s harder to get a seat at certain restaurants, like Carbone or NoMad, than it is a front-row perch at Marc Jacobs. And there are enough crazed street-style peacocks clomping around and #NYFW selfies getting snapped to make the whole scene feel like some endless Kardashian nightmare. But it’s also serious business. The shows bring in an estimated $860 million for the city, more than the projected earnings of the U.S. Open, the New York City Marathon or the Super Bowl. Not bad for an event that began in 1941, when the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union invited 30 journalists to attend a few designers’ showrooms.

2014-02-06,Backstage Beauty Report | Bright Eyes at Creatures of the Wind,"You couldn’t help but notice that flash of electric-blue liner peeking out from under models’ eyes at Creatures of the Wind this morning. But its reason for being there? Not entirely obvious. “It’s actually a lighting effect more than anything else,” revealed the makeup artist James Boehmer. “We pulled colors from the collection and eventually landed on this metallic blue since it gives the eyes a lit-from-within effect, and looks great on everyone.” To achieve the special-effects illusion, Boehmer traced a superfine streak of Nars Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner in Khao San Road on the waterline — that innermost part of the lower lid — so it would “catch the light,” he explained, and “shock the whites of the eyes so they stood out more.” The finished result was a bit ethereal, a bit punk and definitely pretty, even if that wasn’t the point.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/backstage-beauty-report-bright-eyes-at-creatures-of-the-wind/

2014-02-07,Eichmann’s Rabbi Gazes Backward,"Perhaps the most haunting and enduring feature of “Shoah,” Claude Lanzmann’s nine-and-a-half-hour documentary — the closest thing to a definitive cinematic work on the Nazis’ mass murder of European Jews we are likely to have — is its dogged commitment to the present tense. Filmed mostly in the 1970s in some of the places where the killing was planned and carried out, “Shoah,” released in 1985, relies on face-to-face, after-the-fact testimony rather than archival footage or dramatic reconstruction. It is thus simultaneously about the imperative to remember and the inadequacy of memory. A masterpiece of historical detective work, the film is also a philosophical exploration of a gap that has only grown wider in the years since its release.

On a more typical Sunday — “my day of nothing” — she is happy to do little more than kick around her neighborhood, the Upper East Side, or look after her granddaughters, Layla, 7, and Ella, 5, who live in her apartment building with Ms. Johnson’s daughter, Lulu. ",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/nyregion/fashion-sketches-and-cartwheel-practice-with-betsey-johnson.html

In the vast area north of Naples where the Camorra mafia has buried toxic waste for decades, health and environmental authorities will have to carry out tests on the agricultural fields to measure the toxicity levels in the soil.

2014-02-07,What’s On Friday,"9 P.M. (Starz) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance (“Before Sunset”) in Paris that began nine years before that (“Before Sunrise”) in Vienna, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke, above, with Ms. Delpy) are now in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and the son (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) he left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with his son. Celine sees his question as a demand to make it happen. And so they will fight about this — and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women — throughout the course of a day. “ ‘Before Sunrise,’ ‘Before Sunset’ and ‘Before Midnight’ are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists’ offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this trilogy from the director Richard Linklater. Celine and Jesse “can get on your nerves almost as much as they get on each other’s,” Mr. Scott added. “We have known them, and they have known each other, for a long time now, but we don’t know, from one moment to the next, what their future will be, or what it is that keeps them going. That kind of uncertainty, a scary fact of life, is something most movies avoid. We prefer the magical thinking of neat endings, tidy plots and clear character arcs. ‘Before Midnight’ is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

The spotlight continues this year as Myanmar, also known as Burma, takes on the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. For now, though, as the road map for laws and reforms is being drawn, the city remains in a kind of urban time warp, still awaiting a much-needed capital infusion to fuel what it hopes to be its renaissance. Golden pagodas, colonial-era buildings, traditional shop houses and moldering jazz-age mansions form a low-rise fabric unique to Asia, the whole stitched together by tree-lined avenues swarming with buses and cars. While ethnic and religious tensions simmer along Myanmar’s borderlands, including in remote Rakhine State, where there have been recent outbreaks of religious violence, Yangon is far from these areas.

Four assistants occupy chairs around them, all holding laptops. Each of the young people who gather under Luhrmann’s big top has a fantastical back story, at least in his telling. One went to Eton and speaks perfect Chinese; another has a “grandpappy who created a little firm called the C.I.A.” All have areas of concentration — communications, for example, or “moving Baz through time and geography” — and all have been trained in “the Bazmark way,” which means that they carry portable tape recorders to capture his directives and strive always to anticipate his needs.

Charlie McDonnell, a local priest, says that 50 years ago, most climbed the mountain on Reek Sunday, the last Sunday in July. But now, people visit the site every day. Some climb for spiritual reasons, barefoot and clutching rosary beads (Mass is celebrated frequently at the peak), others for their physical health.

2014-02-07,The Body Politic,"It was six yards square and extravagantly swathed in purple and gold, from its velvet headboard and valance to its voluminous damask curtains. The Virgin Queen took it with her when she moved from one royal residence to the next, chased by winter drafts and the inevitable buildup of noisome effluvia emanating from the rudimentary sanitation of her privy. As Anna Whitelock’s “The Queen’s Bed” proves, there is still a new and fascinating vantage from which to consider Elizabeth I. While most historians of the period dissect the body politic, Whitelock doesn’t waste time in the halls of Parliament.

2014-02-07,Scenes From a Marriage,"Visitors to the White House who seek out the well-known portraits of Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan — ­eerie, El Greco-like elongations executed by Aaron Shikler — are sometimes surprised to have their attention arrested by Henriette Wyeth Hurd’s rendering of the far-less-chronicled Pat Nixon. The picture was created several years after the Nixons’ abrupt departure from Washington, and only for the sake of the subject’s daughters. The painted Mrs. Nixon seems stricken, ready to brim with tears. If the portrait could speak, it would most likely say what she herself did after the helicopter lifted off from the South Lawn on Aug. 9, 1974: “It’s so sad.

2014-02-10,Backstage Beauty Report | Liner Notes at Rag & Bone,"You can always count on the Rag & Bone girl to make the call on what’s cool, beauty-wise. For fall, the answer is: loads of graphic eyeliner. “I was inspired by yé-yé girls from the ’60s, like Françoise Hardy,” the makeup artist Gucci Westman said of the “tomboy-ish” look she created backstage this afternoon. Her muse is “accessible and cool,” Westman continued, but has a “contemporary edge and toughness.” In the makeup chair, that translated into a modern cat-eye with a strong, geometric shape. The eyeliner “goes straight out, and doesn’t follow the lash line, which makes it slightly different,” Westman explained of her technique, which involved topping Revlon ColorStay Crème Gel Liner with Revlon ColorStay Liquid Eye Pen. To clean up the edges, Westman relied on an angled Q-Tip when necessary; she left the rest of the face relatively bare. “The eyeliner is meant to be your one trick,” she said. “This is not a high-maintenance girl.” Indeed, the British model Georgia May Jagger paid Westman the ultimate compliment by describing the finished look as “quite normal — it’s actually something I would wear out.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/backstage-beauty-report-liner-notes-at-rag-bone/

2014-02-10,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) 42 (2013) Chadwick Boseman, above, portrays Jackie Robinson, a shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues, a four-sport athlete at U.C.L.A. and an Army officer during World War II. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who selected Robinson to become the first black major leaguer of the modern era. But when Rickey calls his new player “superhuman,” what he means is that Robinson will have to rise above ordinary temptations in the face of prejudice and hostility to become a flawless exemplar of his race. “While ‘42,’ Brian Helgeland’s new film about Robinson, gestures toward the complicated and painful history in which its subject was embroiled,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York York Times, “it is blunt, simple and sentimental, using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson.” He continued, “In other hands — Spike Lee’s, let’s say, or even Clint Eastwood’s — ‘42’ might have taken a tougher, more contentious look at the breaking of Major League Baseball’s color barrier.” But Mr. Helgeland “has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring. Though not accurate in every particular, the movie mostly succeeds in respecting the facts of history and the personality of its hero, and in reminding audiences why he mattered.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

But a cluster of 30 glamorous gams cut from the pages of glossy magazines is more than that. “Legs,” by the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann, questions, with an erotomaniac’s attention to detail, advertising’s ravenous commodification of beauty. The 73-year-old’s work, an obsessive appropriation of everyday objects — from photographs of unmade beds to the front pages of 250 newspapers dated Sept. 12, 2001 — is in line with that of American conceptualists like Richard Prince and Dash Snow. And yet, he has trouble explaining his ideas: “When they asked the Austrian composer Bruckner what inspired his masterwork ‘Te Deum,’ he said it came to him while . . . eating a cheese sandwich.” Feldmann frankly loves sitting in a cafe and admiring the pretty passers-by, but says that the best legs he knows belong to Ursula, his wife of more than 40 years. “Is it sexist of me to focus so much on a woman’s legs?” he wonders. “I don’t know.

Fittingly, the inspiration turned out to be a fashion sketch the designer penned himself in advance of the show. To bring it all to life, Palau etched a deep side part with his comb and saturated strands in Redken Control Addict 28 High-Control Hairspray before wrapping them firmly around the head. “It’s like a very low sweep-over, like a man’s hair,” he remarked (otherwise known as the comb-over; who knew it could look so cool?). Palau then patted on a Redken Shine Flash 02 Glistening Mist for some sheen, and pulled strands into a slim ponytail, which was later tucked out of sight into the models’ clothing. To reinforce this idea of hair-as-fashion-illustration, he also “painted away” the part lines with makeup to prevent any skin from showing, and gave the models who closed the show — including Karlie Kloss, Jacquetta Wheeler and Joan Smalls — a blast of colored hair powder for an ultra-matte effect, like ink set to dry on paper.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/backstage-beauty-report-parting-ways-at-alexander-wang/

2014-02-10,Fox Cancels ‘The X Factor’ After Three Seasons,"Fox has canceled its version of the singing competition series “The X Factor” after three seasons. The announcement followed a statement by the program’s creator, Simon Cowell, who said that he would resume his hosting duties this year on the original British incarnation. “Last year, for a number of reasons, I had to make a decision to return to the U.K. version of ‘The X Factor’ in 2014,” Mr. Cowell said. “So for now, I’m back to the U.K., and I want to thank Fox for being an incredible partner, and I also want to thank everybody who has supported my shows.” “The X Factor” completed its third season in December, drawing 6.2 million total viewers for its finale. Before the series premiere in September 2011, Mr. Cowell said that if the show did not pull in 20 million viewers, it would have to be considered a failure. It fell well short of that, attracting 12.5 million at the start, and it never matched the ratings heights of “American Idol” (once the judging home of Mr. Cowell) on Fox or “The Voice” on NBC.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/arts/television/fox-cancels-the-x-factor-after-three-seasons.html
2014-02-10,‘A Raisin in the Sun’ Loses Diahann Carroll,"Diahann Carroll has dropped out of the Broadway revival of Lorraine Hansberry’s 1959 drama “A Raisin in the Sun.” Ms. Carroll, 78, below, was cast for the role of Lena Younger opposite Denzel Washington as Walter Lee Younger, but she has decided to withdraw “due to the demands of the vigorous rehearsal schedule and the subsequent eight-performances-a-week playing schedule,” according to Philip Rinaldi, a spokesman for the production. LaTanya Richardson Jackson (“Joe Turner’s Come and Gone”) is to assume the role in her place. This was to be Ms. Carroll’s first role on Broadway in over 30 years. She last appeared in a production of John Pielmeier’s play “Agnes of God” in 1983. In 2004, Ms. Carroll, a breast cancer survivor, also had to drop out of a Kennedy Center production of Ernest Thompson’s “On Golden Pond” because of a herniated disk and severe muscle strain. “A Raisin in the Sun” is scheduled to begin previews on March 8 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, with opening night set for April 3 for a 14-week run.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/theater/a-raisin-in-the-sun-loses-diahann-carroll.html

Child dancers regularly learn aspects of technique that are beyond the capacity of us nondancers. But in big theaters, it’s easy to take much for granted — whereas studio conditions bring us closer to the practical physics of ballet.

2014-02-10,"‘Get Lucky,’ Sochi Style","The Olympics usually mint new and unlikely stars. Nearly always, they are athletes. But on Friday night, a group of mostly stern-looking police officers became sudden celebrities by covering “Get Lucky,” Daft Punk’s Grammy Award-winning record of the year shortly before the opening ceremony of the Winter Games from Sochi, Russia. The performance by the Ministry of Internal Affairs choir of “Get Lucky” went viral: It has been seen about 750,000 times since NBC posted it online. The choir’s reward: an appearance on Monday morning on NBC’s “Today.” The incongruity of the choir, dressed in evergreen uniforms accented by yellow braided cords, performing the slightly racy song (“She’s up all night for good fun/I’m up all night to get lucky”), doubtlessly accounts for its appeal. The two lead singers were the stars (a baritone joined them later); some others bobbed their heads but did not get funky, while others looked uncomfortable at their surreal dip into dance music. Rolling Stone labeled the police choir’s rendition “incredible” and noted “the officers’ hilarious ‘old, goofy man dancing at a wedding reception’ dance moves.” A spokeswoman for Daft Punk had no comment on the choir’s cover. The performance followed a studio version of the same number that was posted on YouTube in November.

2014-02-10,Backstage Beauty Report | Ballet Rehearsal Buns at Diane von Furstenberg,"With show venues spread far and wide this season, there’s a certain athleticism involved in leaping around the city. On Diane von Furstenberg’s runway in Tribeca yesterday, the relative endurance of the day fit in well with the designer’s theme. “The collection was inspired by Russian ballerinas,” the hairstylist Orlando Pita said backstage. So naturally hair was whisked up into a bun. But Pita noted an important distinction: “Diane wanted the models to look like they were in rehearsal, rather than in performance.” Conveying that sense of unfinished, dashed-off elegance came down to misting BioSilk Dry Clean Shampoo on fine hair for body or rubbing BioSilk Silk Gel Medium Hold on thicker strands for control, and piling everything up into a high ponytail. The length of the tail was then twisted and wrapped around the base, and slightly spread out with the fingers to create a wide, round shape secured with a cupful of bobby pins. But just when the bun began to look too stage-ready, Pita pulled this last step: “The trick is to put finishing spray on your brush and comb back the hair vertically,” he said, demonstrating the technique around the crown. “This makes it look like someone has taken her fingers and combed her hair up.” It lent a subtle rawness, which did seem quite en pointe.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/backstage-beauty-report-ballet-rehearsal-buns-at-diane-von-furstenberg/

2014-02-11,"Movie Star Points Way to Sanity, Maybe","“The Good Luck of Right Now” is only the second nominally adult novel by Matthew Quick, whose attention-getting first was “The Silver Linings Playbook.” Mr. Quick’s other books have been categorized as young adult fiction, though, in his hands, the two genres are not that different. Among the adult aspects of this new book are the degrees of its characters’ dysfunctionality, the jokey fact that one of them can barely complete a word without inserting an obscenity in the middle of it, and that it takes the epistolary form of a series of letters to “Dear Mr. Richard Gere.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/books/the-good-luck-of-right-now-by-matthew-quick.html

2014-02-11,Backstage Beauty Report | Sporty 3-D Hair at 3.1 Phillip Lim,"Hairstyles captured in fashion photography look amazing — but those coifs need only hold up for a few shutter clicks. Backstage at 3.1 Phillip Lim this afternoon, hair pro Paul Hanlon whipped models’ manes into tousled, sporty-slick styles reminiscent of Bruce Weber’s “O Rio de Janeiro” book from the ’80s, but with a durability that would allow the ‘dos to withstand the rigors of the runway (and several hours’ worth of afterparties). “When you see those pictures, somebody’s gone in and done the hair, and it’s a moment. This is 3-D, the models are walking and moving, and you don’t want anything to fall out,” Hanlon explained. Perhaps that was his full-disclosure reason for applying what he admitted was an “excessive” amount of styling fixers: He first brushed through volumizing mousse for body, then massaged on a root booster to help form a pompadourish flip. Next he saturated strands, section by section, in Moroccanoil Treatment Light to create a wet, separated texture all over, and combed Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream through on the front before pulling the hair tight on the sides and high on the top. To finish, Hanlon doused it all with hair spray.

2014-02-12,Backstage Beauty Report | Fairytale Lips at Rodarte,"The innocence of childhood, glimpsed through the hazy filter of nostalgia, imparted a wistful, weirdly beautiful element to the makeup at Rodarte this afternoon. Backstage, the makeup artist James Kaliardos described the inspiration as the time when “you sort of romanticize things like movies and fairytales that stick with you, and affect the way you see beauty.” The Rodarte princess, however, is all grown up and has a dark side to her as well. Providing that much-needed edge: a pair of iridescent lip colors done in rich shades of mauve and lavender. “Kate and Laura are so into makeup, and the subtle differences in color,” Kaliardos said about the Mulleavy sisters, noting that they spent hours deciding on the final palette. The models’ skin tones largely dictated which of the two shades they would wear, but the application technique was the same: Kaliardos lined the mouth with either Nars Velvet Lip Liner Pencil in El Agua (a deep rose, to be released in the fall) or Nars Eyeliner in Mambo, a reddish brown, and then filled in the lips with a corresponding hue (Nars Lipstick in Dominique Audacious and Deborah Audacious, respectively; both available in the fall). Lastly, he topped everything off with a custom blend of glitter — rose and gold mixed into a base of lipstick and gloss — packed on the mouth with a small makeup brush for precision.

Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims had occupied this building at the beginning of 1850 and while the exterior was not especially prepossessing, with its simple brick facade, the sanctuary looked very elegant. The hall, with a seating capacity of more than 2,500, boasted the largest pipe organ in the United States at the time.

We were in Fort Worth, where Davis, who is a state senator, has lived for about 35 of her 50 years, most in utter obscurity. When she joined the City Council in 1999, she was only the third-most-prominent Wendy Davis in town (the other two were socialites), and to the extent that community leaders knew her at all, it was as the wife of Jeff Davis, an attorney and former city councilman, whose civic passions would spark her own.

In Rebecca Behrens’s debut novel, “When Audrey Met Alice,” the perks that come with living in the White House (swimming pool, bowling alley, fresh-baked cookies on demand) fail to outweigh the loneliness and restrictions Audrey suffers in her role as “first daughter.” Her mother, the president, is distracted by matters of national importance. Her father, a medical researcher known as “the first gent,” is often away at his lab in Baltimore. Audrey’s ordinary teenage conundrums — how to make friends at a new school; how to act around a boy she likes — are amplified by the demands of presidential protocol and security: she can’t even choose her own clothes. It’s no wonder Audrey, who doesn’t mince words, says she sometimes feels “like punching a hole through one of my historic walls.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/books/when-audrey-met-alice-by-rebecca-behrens.html

2014-02-13,Venezuela: At Least Two People Are Killed in Protests,"At least two people were killed in unrest in Caracas on Wednesday, officials said, as thousands of people took to the streets of the capital in the largest antigovernment protest in months. The violence erupted after government opponents attended a peaceful march and rally called to protest the arrest of student demonstrators elsewhere in the country. Following the march, several hundred young protesters threw rocks at riot police officers and broke windows in a government building. One demonstrator was shot in the head and killed, and protesters blamed armed pro-government supporters. Later, President Nicolás Maduro said a community activist he had known for years had also been killed. Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly, said the man was killed by “fascists,” a term the government uses for its opponents. Mr. Maduro later said on television, “I alert the world: we are facing a planned coup d’état.” The protests in various cities in recent weeks have sprung from widespread discontent amid increasing economic problems, including high inflation.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/world/middleeast/venezuela-two-people-are-killed-in-protests.html

2014-02-13,What’s on Thursday,"2 P.M. (Starz Cinema) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” Mr. Scott wrote, adding that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

Mr. Mamet’s title was always a bit of a misnomer — his jagged play is more interested in romantic confusion and emotional complication than in freaky bedroom matters — but his map of the crooked paths to heterosexual bliss remains useful and adaptable, even when softened and tidied up by Hollywood.

Miller, who considers her open-mike nights “the last vestiges of bohemianism in downtown New York,” attributes the decline to gentrification and the Internet, where people can more easily get their fix of performance art by up-and-comers. “There isn’t the incentive that we had in the ’90s to get out the door and actually do something.” But for Daniel Gallant, director of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which introduced open mikes in 1973, social media has been a boon: “The performances generate more viral activity online,” he says.

2014-02-14,Inside the List,"The Doctor Will Thrill You Now: Like a lot of brand-name novelists, Robin Cook drops a new book every year or two — in Cook’s case, medical thrillers with punchy, ominous titles like “Outbreak,” “Terminal” or “Contagion” that invariably land on the list. His latest, “Cell” (new at No. 11), is his 28th hardcover best seller since “Coma” made his reputation in 1977. Cook started his career as a practicing doctor, but eventually devoted himself more and more to writing, where the malpractice premiums are presumably lower. From the start, he has applied himself studiously to his craft. “It’s easier to get a book published if it’s going to be a best seller,” he told an interviewer in 1977, “so I went back to some old New York Times best-seller lists and tried to find books that came from theretofore unknown writers, to try to determine what kind of book had the best chances of making the list. I found the mystery-thriller genre seemed to do this best.” If that approach seems more robotic than inspired, well, so can Cook’s prose — “Cell” may be the first thriller to open with an entire paragraph about insulin molecules. (“Rapidly infiltrating the veins, they rushed headlong into the heart, to be pumped out through the arteries.”) Then again, Cook doesn’t make great claims for himself as a writer. “I’m a storyteller,” he told the CBS reporter Don Dahler earlier this month. “I have never been tempted to wear a turtleneck — big turtleneck, white turtleneck.

Joining Cunard in her restless experimentation were the outrageous actress Tallulah Bankhead, the brazen aristocrat Diana Cooper, the electrifying jazz dancerJosephine Baker, the Polish-Russian painter Tamara de Lempicka and America’s über-flapper, Zelda Fitzgerald. They shared an edgy ambition and a taste for immoderation that led them crashing through the public psyche, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes not, but always on toward emancipation — or at least on to the next great party. As Mackrell demonstrates so elegantly, their collective defiance redefined the feminine possible.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/books/review/flappers-and-careless-people.html

In our Sign of the Times essay, Cathy Horyn examines the divide between what women actually want to wear — beautiful clothes that they feel good in — and the tricked-out, challenging get-ups that come down the runway. We also celebrate three women who insist on doing things their way: the designer Maria Cornejo, whose art-inspired designs stay true to her singular vision; the up-and-coming singer Kelela, who is finding her voice somewhere between electronic music and old-school R&B; and the Fiat heiress Ginevra Elkann, who juggles duties as a film producer, art museum boss and mother while building a legacy — and a home — that goes beyond her famous name. Additional highlights include a behind-the-scenes look at Matthew Barney’s epic new art film; a pair of New York icons, Elaine Stritch and Chloë Sevigny, tune in to the latest rap music; and five prominent novelists — Colson Whitehead, Douglas Coupland, Mona Simpson, Joyce Carol Oates and Roddy Doyle — invite us into the spaces where they created their latest works.

The students have all lost someone close to them. “This is the street I don’t like, because it has guns,” says Jaron Williams, 11, not far from where his 19-year-old brother was shot to death. “I cried the whole day. I couldn’t get him out of my head.” Then Jaron, above, joined the Roots of Music, a free music education program for middle schoolers, and learned to play the trumpet, earning his way into the Marching Crusaders — and a parade. “I feel like I’m the best thing in the world and I can’t be stopped,” he says. It’s the power of the music, Wilbert Rawlins Jr., one of the featured band directors ,maintains. “I don’t care if you just had something very tragic that happened to you in your life,” he says. “Once that band gives you that downbeat, and that music is right, and it’s powerful — just for that brief two or three minutes, you forget everything, every problem you had.

2014-02-17,"‘Lego Movie’ Tops Box Office, With ‘About Last Night’ Strong Second","Bookended by Valentine’s Day and President’s Day, the weekend was a strong one for Hollywood, despite a flatlining “Winter’s Tale” and worries that winter storms in parts of the United States would keep moviegoers on their sofas. Certifying itself as a full-blown phenomenon, “The Lego Movie” (Warner Brothers) will take in a projected $60 million between Friday and Monday, for a two-week domestic total of roughly $140 million. “About Last Night” (Sony), one of three 1980s-era remakes to arrive over the weekend, was expected to be the No. 1 newcomer by selling a strong $30.2 million in tickets. Co-starring the popular comedian Kevin Hart, “About Last Night” cost $13 million to make. Third-place “RoboCop” from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony was a disappointment considering that it had a production budget of at least $100 million; if analyst projections hold, the science-fiction remake will take in $25.1 million over the long weekend, for a total since opening on Wednesday of about $30 million. (A Sony spokeswoman noted that “RoboCop” is performing “very strongly” overseas, where it has taken in more than $70 million since opening earlier this month.) “The Monuments Men,” also from Sony, was expected to be a solid fourth, generating a projected $17.3 million, for a two-week total of about $46 million. Analysts estimated that Universal’s poorly reviewed remake of “Endless Love” would take in about $15.2 million, which is fine for a lightly marketed movie that cost about $20 million to make. But Akiva Goldsman’s “Winter’s Tale” (Warner) bombed badly, taking in a projected $8.5 million. Adapted from the 1983 magical realism novel, “Winter’s Tale” cost Warner and financing partner Village Roadshow at least $45 million to make.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/lego-movie-tops-box-office-with-about-last-night-strong-second/

The party patriarch Deng Xiaoping deemed the demonstrations, based in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, a grave threat to party power. He authorized martial law in urban Beijing, ousted Mr. Hu’s successor as party general secretary, the reform-minded Zhao Ziyang, and ordered the People’s Liberation Army to end the demonstrations. The crackdown culminated in troops taking Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4. Across Beijing, many hundreds of protesters and ordinary citizens caught in the wrong place died from military gunfire, and soldiers also died at the hands of incensed residents. The precise number of dead has been in dispute ever since 1989.",World,https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/q-a-steven-i-levine-on-tiananmen-initiative-project/

Though they are best friends bound by the same adolescent humor, Jesse’s lack of ambition doesn’t allow the focused Celeste to stay with him. But she can’t quit him, either — until suddenly she must. “While ‘Celeste and Jesse’ is decidedly conventional in most respects, it’s pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman that’s no longer predicated by mutual desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

I was behind the wheel of a 1963 Chevrolet Impala I bought outside Asheville, N.C. The car ran well and was beautiful — champagne body with a cream top, no dents, no rust. It still even had these original plastic discs, like thin translucent washers, that fit between the window roller and the door panel to keep the upholstery from being indented or pinched. I was planning to sell it in Los Angeles, where a ’63 two-door Impala in such cherry condition was the ultimate low rider and worth a lot of money.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/magazine/rachel-kushner.html

She was sitting on a stoop with an equally glamorous friend, drinking iced coffee. She had been meaning to call me. She knew it was late notice, but she wondered if by any chance I was free for a party at a friend’s compound — compound! — in the Hamptons that weekend.

And then after that, I wanted to go only to places with the biggest, weirdest rocks. Two specific memories come to mind from the past year: one is sleeping on a boat deck with my brothers under what felt like the darkest sky with the brightest stars in the Andaman Sea off Myanmar. And the other is standing with friends at the throat of an eroded volcano in New Mexico called Shiprock, right as the sun was setting on one of the last days of the year.

The college, President Obama’s alma mater, found that its endowment does not have investments in companies that manufacture such weapons for public sale, and its board of trustees voted to ensure it stays that way. “It’s a statement of principle about the mission of higher education to be a voice of reason in a world of a lot of violence,” said Occidental politics professor Peter Dreier, who was a prime mover on the issue.",Opinion,https://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/the-gun-report-february-20-2014/

(Moore is one of the all-time great deployers of the exclamation point, that cheap and skinny punctuational powerhouse — she’s also a great deployer of the epithet — so I thought I’d try one and see how it felt.

2014-02-20,Tragedy and Farce,"Gregory Feifer’s “Russians: The People Behind the Power” joins a list of classic books by Western correspondents who have covered the politics and culture of what was once the Soviet Union. ­Hedrick Smith, Robert G. Kaiser, David K. Shipler and David Remnick, among others, wrote acclaimed accounts of what they witnessed as the Soviet Union first challenged the West and then gradually collapsed under the weight of a sclerotic regime. In August 1991, Feifer was an undergraduate spending a summer in Moscow when a group of hard-line Communist officials tried to carry out a coup in a last-ditch effort to prolong Soviet rule. Their failure only sped up the process of dissolution and led to an initial period of such euphoria that many people inside and outside the country believed — as did Feifer himself — that “the U.S.S.R. would be a part of the international community, enjoying the West’s previously unimaginable freedom and prosperity.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/russians-and-words-will-break-cement.html

(The second EP was produced by Arca, who worked on Kanye West’s “Yeezus.”) The methodical, strangely placed stresses of the beats signify a lot: isolation, displacement, missed connections. Something of interest — a little burst of rhythm or a bending, decaying electronic tone — occurs in nearly every bar.

That very evening, a memorable midcourse of sea scallops with pistachios and licorice at Restaurant Daniel suggested the pairing may be worth a test run.

One of the most memorable accounts of that first night was written by the American critic Carl Van Vechten, who allied himself decidedly with the latter camp, reporting that a kindred soul in the seat behind him was so carried away that he began beating a tattoo on the critic’s head with his fists. “My emotion was so great,” Van Vechten wrote, “that I did not feel the blows for some time.” Sharing his box was another pillar of the avant-garde, Gertrude Stein, who remembered certain details differently — as well she should, Van Vechten assured her. They had actually attended the less eventful second night of the ballet, but, as he suavely added, “one must only be accurate about such details in a work of fiction.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/the-tastemaker-by-edward-white.html

2014-02-21,The Last Trial,"In Jay Cantor’s 1988 novel, “Krazy Kat,” the feline heroine praises Rube Goldberg contraptions: “Krazy liked having her mind pulled through one of Goldberg’s gadgets. He was a real artist; he had a vision.” Cantor’s vision often fo­cuses on public figures: George Herriman’s cartoon cat and J. Robert Oppenheimer; Che Guevara in Cantor’s first novel, “The Death of Che Guevara”; and now Kafka in “Forgiving the Angel.” These works and his graphic novel, “Aaron and Ahmed,” are contraptions of mixed materials: animal and human characters in “Krazy Kat,” fact and invention in “Che Guevara,” lucid writing and hallucinatory illustrations (by James Romberger) in “Aaron and Ahmed,” and now a story putatively by Kafka and stories about contemporaries who loved him. All of Cantor’s fiction (including “Great Neck,” his un-­gadgety novel of the American 1960s and ’70s) pulls the reader’s mind through sensitive history: atom bomb tests at Alamogordo; the Cuban revolution; the events of 9/11; and, in “Forgiving the Angel,” Stalin’s gulag and Hitler’s death camps.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/forgiving-the-angel-by-jay-cantor.html

St. Vincent. From a distance, it looked a bit like a toothbrush or perhaps one of those hand-held, skin-firming wands. Nope! Turns out, it was one of three new Masterclass Makeup Brushes from M.A.C. Launched this winter, these newfangled tools perform all the usual beauty tasks — blending eye shadow, smudging eyeliner, buffing foundation into the skin, saturating the lips with color — albeit with a supercool design unlike that of a traditional brush. The most noticeable difference: The head and handle point toward the face, rather than away from it, which allows you to actually see what you’re doing in the mirror without hands getting in the way (imagine that!). Another plus: The densely packed synthetic bristles — or, rather, “cosmefibres” — evenly disperse makeup particles over the face, sans streaks. Oh, and the rubberized handles are just comfy to hold, which is key for a busy makeup artist like Regan Rabanal, who spent hours painting faces at numerous New York Fashion Week shows, including Zac Posen, Cushnie Et Ochs and Badgley Mischka.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/t-magazine/on-beauty-new-beauty-tools-mac.html

The latest example is the onetime hit science-fiction series “Heroes,” which NBC announced it would resurrect as “Heroes Reborn,” a 13-episode series in 2015. The network used its platform of the Winter Olympics to tease out the announcement on Saturday, running a brief promotion. The news release that followed on Saturday night confirmed a few details: Tim Kring, who created the original “Heroes” in the 2006 television season, will be back as the executive producer. Before that, NBC is to create a digital series that will introduce the new story and characters. (Some original cast members may return.) Jennifer Salke, NBC’s president for entertainment, said in a statement that most details about the new version would be “appropriately shrouded in mystery.” Exactly when the show might appear is not known. Perhaps NBC will wait to see how the most immediate progenitor of the idea, Fox’s revival of “24,” fares this summer. CBS fashioned a hit last summer out of “Under the Dome” and has another such event-style short-run sci-fi series, “Extant,” with Halle Berry, planned for this summer.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/business/media/nbc-to-bring-back-heroes-in-new-form.html

The overall effect is hypnotic and somewhat unbearable. To what end?

This season, the ripples of those statement pieces have hit designers’ collections like a tidal wave, making the multicolored fur coat a must-have item for fall 2014. Although it is a trend we have seen before — especially at Céline, where color-blocked fur has become a signature of sorts — the frequency with which we’re now seeing fur with a graphic quality is making what once seemed like a luxury item feel like a new wardrobe staple. We first saw a version in New York at Altuzarra, where the young designer dressed up a simple, dark fur coat with vibrant colors like Yves Klein blue and tangerine. Then at J. Mendel, the house run by a long line of furriers, bold colors and abstract, latticelike color-blocking offered a fresh and modern take on the brand’s signature material. Finally at Marni in Milan, vertical panels of cobalt, white and crimson made an oversize silhouette seem long and lean — and a fluffy, neutral-colored collar provided the ultimate luxurious top-off.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/threes-a-trend-color-blocked-fur-coats/

To the left of the divide, tousled locks were tucked behind the ear and draped naturally over the shoulder. And on the right, they were pushed forward over the ear for what Philippon described as a “rock ‘n’ roll twist.” “I loaded the hair with Bb.Gel from Bumble and Bumble,” he explained while combing the product through and then ruffling it with his fingers. To finish, he used Bumble and Bumble’s new City Swept spray, which provided “beautiful natural shine.” The texture of this look is in fact quite stiff, but it offers the illusion of soft, wet hair. “I would have left it wet,” Philippon noted, “but we had fur.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/backstage-beauty-report-cedric-charliers-side-swept-locks/

Either option could end their marriage. “It is a rigorously honest movie about the difficulties of being honest, a film that tries to be truthful about the slipperiness of truth,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi and starring his daughter, Sarina, as the couple’s child. “It also sketches a portrait — perhaps an unnervingly familiar picture for American audiences — of a society divided by sex, generation, religion and class.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Lehane, who is 46, spent six years working in the Clinton White House, battling the ethical scandals that seemed to confront the administration every day — typically by discrediting the accuser or leaking a document to undercut an impending news story critical of the president or the first lady. Now Lehane uses similar strategies — opposition research, attention-grabbing antics, the crafty manipulation of old and new media — for groups like this one, the Consumer Attorneys of California. The campaign to raise the cap on damages for pain and suffering in medical malpractice suits, which was set at $250,000, might have been handled legislatively, but much high-impact law in California is made at the ballot box, in the form of well-publicized voter initiatives.

The Ice carpet was knotted by a Tibetan family using wool from sheep, yak and goats combined with silk.

The trend continued at Marc Jacobs, whose neutral collection was filled with plush, nubby matching separates like a ribbed, V-neck long sweater with coordinating leggings and scarf. And at Edun, a sporty ivory tank dress paired with slouchy trousers and sneakers in the same color looked like the ultimate weekend wardrobe.

At 14, he saw a photograph of a passenger pigeon in an Audubon Society book and “fell in love.” But he didn’t know that the Science Museum of Minnesota, which he was then visiting with a summer program for North Dakotan high-school students, had them in their collection, so he was shocked when he came across a cabinet containing two stuffed pigeons, a male and a female, mounted in lifelike poses. He was overcome by awe, sadness and the birds’ physical beauty: their bright auburn breasts, slate-gray backs and the dusting of iridescence around their napes that, depending on the light and angle, appeared purple, fuchsia or green. Before his chaperones dragged him out of the room, Novak snapped a photograph with his disposable camera. The flash was too strong, however, and when the film was processed several weeks later, he was haunted to discover that the photograph hadn’t developed. It was blank, just a flash of white light.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/the-mammoth-cometh.html

They saddle students with crushing debt while furnishing them useless degrees – or no degrees at all. These schools have been known to push students who are eligible for low-cost, federal loans into ruinously priced private loans that have fewer consumer protections and that give borrowers who get in trouble little choice but to default. That in turn makes it difficult for them to find jobs, get credit or rent apartments.

But instead of using makeup to create the illusion of a flawless face, he pampered the models with face massages to help the blood circulate and to suss out an all-natural glow. Pecheux then nourished the skin with Rodin Olio Lusso face oil, for both hydration and luminosity, followed by Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme and Idealist Pore-Minimizing Skin Refinisher. After this deluxe treatment, Pecheux applied foundation — he advises mixing two hues, especially during transitional seasons — and powder. Eyebrows were teased out to be fuller, “but not bushy, not extravagant, not Frida Kahlo,” he explained, adding that “eyebrows give a woman character.” Overall, it was a spare, natural look. “If your skin looks beautiful, you already look beautiful. After that, everything else is accessory,” Pecheux reasoned. “At Balmain, there is a lot of accessorizing on the body, so you don’t need accessorizing on the face.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/backstage-beauty-report-truly-glowing-skin-at-balmain/

2014-02-28,White Lies,"Strange times, crowed too many wise and unwise men over the millenniums. But as the art critic Jerry Saltz wrote in New York magazine last fall, maybe we’re finally at a point where the strangeness of the times is matched by an ability to accept it. In defending the perplexing Kanye West video “Bound 2,” Saltz heralded this as an age of the New Uncanny. The all-American banal-bizarre spectacle of the video (synthetic sunsets; slow-motion galloping stallions; the nippleless ingénue) is “a freakish act of creation and destruction by appropriation,” what Saltz deems “part of a collective cultural fracturing.” Saltz is riffing on Freud’s description of the uncanny as “nothing new or alien, but something familiar and old-established in the mind and which has become alienated from it only through the process of repression.” But maybe we’re not as alienated as we once were, something that occurred to me when beholding another unapologetic, all-encompassing contradiction-celebration: the story-allegory and real-surreal gyre of Helen Oyeyemi’s gloriously unsettling new novel, “Boy, Snow, Bird.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/boy-snow-bird-by-helen-oyeyemi.html

(Some kite strings have been dipped in an emulsion that includes finely ground glass.) When a participant successfully downs another kite, a small trumpet sounds a victory blast. The festival, which is celebrated at the end of the mild Indian winter, when daytime temperatures hover in the 80s, is tied to a traditional day on the Hindu calendar that marks the change of seasons. “Flying a kite brings good luck and good fortune in the new year,” says Tobias Hutzler, who captured images of the festival. “They are sending wishes into the air.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/battle-of-the-kites.html

2014-02-28,Inside the List,"Building Blocks: There’s a sweet moment in “All Joy and No Fun,” Jennifer Senior’s smart new look at modern parenting (it’s at No. 16 after three weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list), in which Clint Holder, one of the fathers Senior shadowed, shows his older son how to assemble a Lego ice-cream truck. “Here, let me help,” he says: “You put this thing on the back of it.” Watching him snap the pieces together, Senior observes that Clint “plumps with life, like a diabetic who’s finally been handed a sucking candy.” Then he notices her noticing him, and offers a sheepish-sounding explanation: “I’m biased about Legos,” he says. “They’re what I played with when I was little.” The scene will resonate with anybody who’s watched “The Lego Movie” — half of America, in other words — which likewise features a father passionate about his Lego creations. (The movie’s success has spilled over onto the best-seller list; a junior novelization, “Lego, the Lego Movie,” remains at No. 3 in its fifth week on the children’s middle-grade list.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2014-02-28,Passages to India,"In 1671, the East India Company sent 20 single women to Bombay, each supplied with an allowance of £300, a new set of clothing and a simple directive — to find a company-approved mate within a year. “In those early days,” Anne de Courcy remarks, “marriage was often undertaken with the sort of rapidity usually confined to spotting a business opportunity and pouncing on it.” But as she follows the long history of what came to be known as the fishing fleet, which supplied a steady cargo of potential brides to generations of expats, it seems clear that the official coupling of a man and a woman in British India, despite an often hastily applied gloss of romance, continued to be conducted in distinctly commercial style. By the 19th century, potential wives were paying a bond of £200 for the privilege of sailing off to a strange land to ally themselves with a virtual stranger. And pity the poor soul who — despite a ratio of three or four men to every woman, inspiring tales of proposals offered at funerals and engagements announced as husbands lay dying — failed to drag the humblest prospect to the altar. Put on a ship back to England, she would now be dismissed as one of the “Returned Empties.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/the-fishing-fleet-by-anne-de-courcy.html

2014-02-28,Days of the Dead,"“On our mountain only boys were born,” Ladydi Garcia Martínez tells us in the opening pages of Jennifer Clement’s new novel, “Prayers for the Stolen,” “and some of them turned into girls around the age of 11.” Rather than a tale of transgender magic realism, however, this is the story of a young Mexican girl who grows up in a rural mountain community in the Pacific state of Guerrero — “a land of red insects and women” — not far from Acapulco. Although named after Diana, Princess of Wales — the “saint for betrayed women” — Ladydi is called “Boy” by her mother, Rita. Turning girls into boys — or at least making them ugly — is a matter of survival on the mountain. Girls get short haircuts at the “ugly parlor”; Ladydi even colors her teeth with black and yellow markers to make them look rotted. “All the drug traffickers had to do was hear that there was a pretty girl around,” she says, “and they’d sweep onto our lands in black Escalades and carry the girl off.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/prayers-for-the-stolen-by-jennifer-clement.html
2014-02-28,A Body in the Snow,"The violent murder of a young innocent underpins Andrea Portes’s second novel, “Bury This.” Beth Krause is the victim in a 1978 case that is revitalized in 2003, when a group of film students starts to make a documentary of her life. The question posed by one of them is: “If 25 years can discover the Internet, the cellphone, this thing the iPod, can 25 years discover the secret of a girl murdered, abandoned, by the side of the road?” But the question at the heart of “Bury This” isn’t about the possibilities brought by advances in forensic science but about the possibilities of language in the face of the ugliest truths.

2014-02-28,Willkommen,"Among the trophies of the Second World War captured by Allied intelligence agents were Nazi scientists and their research on biological and chemical weapons. In a classified memorandum titled “Exploitation of German Scientists in Science and Technology in the United States,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff described these men as “chosen, rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use.” Such intellectual spoils were not to fall into Soviet hands. In 1945, Operation Overcast (renamed Operation Paperclip for the paper clips attached to the dossiers of the most “troublesome cases”) began. More than 1,600 Germans were secretly recruited to develop armaments “at a feverish and paranoid pace that came to define the Cold War.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/operation-paperclip-by-annie-jacobsen.html
2014-02-28,Bleak Houses,"If anyone can make you root for the murderer, it’s Denise Mina, whose defiantly unsentimental novels are less concerned with personal guilt than with the social evils that create criminals and the predators who nurture them. THE RED ROAD (Little, Brown, $26), as fierce a story as any Mina has written, opens in 1997 with a shocking double murder in a seedy section of Glasgow. The murderer gives up without a fight, and that, you’d think, should be that — except for the fact that the killer, Rose Wilson, is a 14-year-old prostitute (“looking 16, feeling 12”) and one of the men she stabbed to death was the pimp who had hired her out to service eight men.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/denise-minas-red-road-and-more.html
2014-02-28,Girlfish,"Alice Hoffman has always celebrated the marvelousness of what’s real in the world, even as she creates the distinctive atmosphere of uncanniness and magical potential that looms over her fiction. Her devoted readers expect melodramatic stories imbued with the atmosphere of folk tales. Omens and portents are her stock in trade. Feminist themes and generous amounts of Renaissance Faire-style potted history make her storytelling all the more suggestive. Eerie and powerful acts of nature signify undercurrents of mood the way irregular minor chords in the background music tell us how to feel during ominous scenes at the movies. Lost in a dark forest of one kind or another, Hoffman’s characters have a heightened awareness of the hidden meanings that surround them as they struggle toward the light.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/alice-hoffmans-museum-of-extraordinary-things.html

Wilson’s “Once You Break a Knuckle” keeps a rarer company — the collection in which the stories are in conversation, and together form a world to be explored not linearly but sideways, more than once, through previously unexplored corridors and secret passageways hiding in plain sight. These books, by design, are echo chambers of empathy. The world is large, they seem to say, and it is full of other people whose lives are as important to themselves as mine is to me and yours is to you.

2014-02-28,Just Say Nein,"Joachim Fest’s fascinating memoir about what it was like to come of age during the years of the Third Reich is unusual because its central character is not the author but the author’s remarkable father. Johannes Fest was the middle-class headmaster of a primary school in suburban Berlin, a pious Catholic and father of five, a cultural conservative who revered Goethe and Kant, and a loyal German patriot — “a dyed-in-the-wool Prussian,” in Fest’s words — the kind of person who might have been expected to become an active supporter of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists. In a foreword by Herbert Arnold (a professor emeritus of German studies at Wesleyan University who has also supplied informative notes throughout the text), the elder Fest is described as “tailor-made for a career” with the Nazis. And yet some quirk in his personality made him a fierce Weimar republican, ready to sacrifice himself, even his family, to principles he knew to be right even as everyone around him was yielding to mass hysteria. “Not I,” a best seller in Germany when it appeared in 2006, the year of the author’s death at age 79, is a memorable tale of lonely courage, stoic endurance, self-imposed hardship and a life lived amid ubiquitous, all-­encompassing danger: “Even ­innocent-sounding remarks could be life-and-death matters.” It reminds us that simple human decency is possible even in the most trying of ­circumstances.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/not-i-by-joachim-fest.html

On Friday, Mr. Dessner celebrates the release of “St. Carolyn by the Sea,” his debut album of orchestral music for Deutsche Grammophon, with a concert by Ensemble LPR, Le Poisson Rouge’s house chamber orchestra. The program includes Mr. Dessner’s “Lachrimae” and another piece from his CD, a suite from the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood’s score for “There Will Be Blood.” André de Ridder, who conducts the Copenhagen Philharmonic on Mr. Dessner’s album, makes his New York debut with this concert.

Mr. Stingel, who is known for continuously expanding his repertoire, has recently been immersing himself in landscapes.

2014-03-03,It Takes a Funeral: So Much Angst,"Patrice Chéreau was a creature of the theater. But he had a parallel career as a moviemaker, which the Film Society of Lincoln Center is honoring in the series Patrice Chéreau: The Love That Dares. If nothing he did for the screen had the genre-shaking impact of his stage work — his 1976 “Ring” cycle at Bayreuth helped usher in an era of Regietheater, or director’s theater — he did raise eyebrows with the sexually explicit “Intimacy” (2001), starring all of Mark Rylance, the corseted Olivia in the “Twelfth Night” that just ended its Broadway run. “Intimacy” was much discussed for how much it showed and how real or not the sex was, though what’s most real — and naked — is the emotional life of Mr. Rylance’s character. “Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train” (1998) only seems more buttoned up. As a train hurtles toward Limoges and a funeral, Mr. Chéreau plunges us into a world of interlocking relationships, of sex, desire, despondency. The style is distinctly cinematic, but the emotion verges on operatic. (Through Wednesday; filmlinc.com.) ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/it-takes-a-funeral-so-much-angst.html
