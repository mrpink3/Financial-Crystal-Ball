The encore was also heard by millions of listeners because the performance, the last show of the run, was broadcast on radio. Within hours the Met sent out a news release pointing out the encore and mentioning that Mr. Flórez was the last Met performer to offer one (in 2008) and that Luciano Pavarotti was the previous singer to do so (in 1994). The Met had banned encores in recent decades amid a more serious performance atmosphere. But the current general manager, Peter Gelb, has loosened the reins in what he has called an effort to make opera more exciting and entertaining.

Now she is quite a serious competitor, coupling her running workouts with weight lifting, lunges, squats and time on the rowing machine. “I don’t do it for longevity,” said Daprano, who resides in Atlanta. “I do it to be the best at being alive right now.” Five years ago, she became the first woman to run a seven-minute mile (6:47.91) after 70. And last month, running in the 75-79 age bracket, she set world records in the 400 meters (1:21.28), the 800 (3:18.48) and the mile (7:13.51).

But he also kept up with the running, working out on his own. It was good for his wind. “Air to a trumpet player is like gas to a car,” he said. He sometimes bet his bandmates he could beat them in the mile, running the distance himself while six or seven of them used a relay. “I took a lot of their money,” he boasted. Shaheed has been running masters events for three decades. In 2010, he became the first 60-year-old to break five minutes in the indoor mile (4:57.06). In February, he broke the world indoor record for the 60-64 age group with a 4:35.07 in the 1,500 meters.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/sports/track-and-field-masters-nolan-shaheed-62.html

And at 60, he returned to the dashes, and though his knees lock up every now and again, he is back to being the champion he was at Kansas. In January, he set two indoor world records in the 75-79 age bracket, running the 60 meters in 8.49 seconds and the 200 in 27.03.

So after four seasons of challenging pieces like patterned pajama sets and over-the-top quilted coats, the Northern Irish designer J. W. Anderson (left) has come down to earth — at least a little — for his first prefall collection. Alongside straight-leg pants, pleated skirts and jewel-tone turtlenecks (including one in blue with bright green sleeves), Anderson still offers plenty of quilting: a white A-line skirt, a red-and-white checkerboard print jacket and two puffy bombers, one in black patent leather and another in brown with white sleeves and a shearling collar. “I like the idea of storytelling, and for me this collection was the prequel to my fall collection,” the designer says. “Both collections are for the same woman and for me all the pieces work together, but I definitely aimed to design clothes that were easier and more relatable.” That doesn’t mean Anderson has lost touch with the avant-garde. For fall expect vinyl suiting, pillow-top apron skirts and a curious take on the deerstalker cap. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/easy-does-it/

The Sephardim were welcomed in Turkey, and many went to Greece, North Africa and the Middle East as well. I’ve chosen an assortment of vegetarian dishes from all of these places for this week’s Recipes for Health. Throughout the Mediterranean, springtime is the season for spinach and other greens, artichokes and fava beans, and these vegetables make delicious appearances at Passover meals.

Sunhee Hwang, a South Korean-born designer whose second collection won her an Ecco Domani prize this year, has this tip: “Before thoughts of fine fabrics, look for beautiful colors,” she says. “That’s what gets us into the dressing rooms in the hopes of finding winsome silhouettes and flattering lines.” Hwang certainly has a way with a frock herself: at the 1995 Fashion Institute of Technology graduation show, her tangerine gown attracted the attention of the Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz, then at Geoffrey Beene. “He said to me, ‘Your dresses are very beautiful. Why don’t you work for me?’ ” recalls Hwang, now 38. After stints at Beene, Anna Sui, Elie Tahari and Anne Klein, Hwang is back in the limelight with knockout Sunhee dresses, like an airy silk confection in maize yellow (above right; $825 at sunheeny.com) and a flirty salsa number in rich cobalt ($395 at sunheeny.com). “When you look at beautiful clothes, it doesn’t matter who the designer is,” she says, citing Narciso Rodriguez’s color-blocked sheaths and Jonathan Saunders’s vibrant shifts as examples of smart fits in smashing colors. “As long as you look gorgeous and feel special, you will buy it.

2012-04-03,Bookshelf | Will Oldham Speaks,"Will Oldham does not care for interviews. They’re often confounding and pointless, he finds, and the media does not seem to think he is good at giving them. What’s more, he does not want to get better. “It just feels so wrong most of the time,” the singer-songwriter and actor tells his friend Alan Licht, in a new book-length interview. “It’s just a waste of time, because it doesn’t have anything to do with anything, and it demands a lot of time and a lot of thought, and the thought has nothing to do with anything.” The book, “Will Oldham on Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy,” which will be published in Britain by Faber & Faber on Thursday and in the United States by Norton this fall, is one very long interview — an interview to end all interviews, the hope seems to be. And it just might work, for within the book’s 382 pages Oldham answers nearly every question one might wish to ask about his prolific output, which he has recorded and performed variously as Will Oldham, Palace Brothers, Palace Music, Palace Songs, Palace, Bonnie (Prince) Billy, Bonnie Billy, and Bonnie (Prince) Billy and the Cairo Gang. Longtime fans will appreciate the book’s generous portion of inside baseball. He wrote the song “I Am a Cinematographer,” for instance, after reading Robert Bresson’s “Notes on the Cinematographer,” and initially agreed to play piano on Johnny Cash’s cover of his song “I See a Darkness” despite not knowing how to play piano. (He later fessed up and instead conducted Cash and sang back-up vocals, in a recording session he recalls as surreal: “I remember it was as if I was a Colorform or paper doll that had just been pasted into that situation.”) Readers may also be amused to learn that he once passed up a possible part on “Doogie Howser, M.D.”; took classes in the waltz, the cha-cha-cha and scuba diving; and admires the comic timing of Foghorn Leghorn and Bugs Bunny, whom he cites as an influence. Though Oldham declined to be interviewed about the interview, The Moment was delighted to mine an advance copy for some of its choicest quotations.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/bookshelf-will-oldham-speaks/

2012-04-04,More on the Mandate,"My Sunday column made one point that I’d like to slightly amend. Discussing the individual mandate, I wrote: “The provision is unpopular enough that it’s unlikely to survive in the long run even if Anthony Kennedy flips a coin and decides to uphold it.” In reality, it depends on what you mean by “survive.” If Mitt Romney wins the presidency, the mandate will probably be repealed outright. If Barack Obama is re-elected, on the other hand, I would expect it to endure at least for a time, but as a poorly enforced, widely flouted, easily exploited, and generally derided aspect of American law. As it stands, the mandate already depends on a norm of law-abidingness to make its provisions work, because the penalty is small enough that people could actually save money over the long haul by paying the fine until they get sick and then taking advantage of guaranteed issue to buy insurance. Over time, I doubt that norm will hold (what worked in Massachusetts, a liberal state with a small uninsured population, is not necessarily going to work in a nation of 300 millions), and I doubt the penalty will ever be raised. So even if the mandate technically survives, the combination of non-enforcement, non-compliance and inflation will gradually make it all-but-meaningless as policy.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/more-on-the-mandate/

Her account highlights several prophetic works and visionaries, from Ezekiel to Paul to the ancient sect of prophesying Christians called the Montanists, and others. Pagels also discusses the afterlife of Revelation in the Christianity of late antiquity through the fourth century. Her thesis is that apocalyptic literature — visions, prophecies, predictions of cataclysm — has always carried political ramifications, both revolutionary and reactionary, liberal and conservative, from the very beginning up until today, as seen in conservative iterations of millennial dispensationalism and the hugely popular “Left Behind” series of novels about the end of the world.

Thus was the seed planted for a new collaborative industrial organization — teaming up theoreticians, experimentalists, material scientists, metallurgists, engineers and even telephone pole climbers — that eventually became Bell Labs.

The movie didn’t fare so well at the box office — it was released just a few months after the Challenger disaster — but 10 years old and indifferent to the critics, I loved it.

Strayed is also the author of a novel, “Torch,” but for the past two years her most widely read work was written anonymously: on Valentine’s Day, Strayed revealed that she was the voice behind the wise and compassionate advice column “Dear Sugar” at the Web site The Rumpus. “Maybe this whole thing will crumble once who I am is no longer a secret,” she reflected in the column a month before spilling the beans. “I don’t know exactly where we are now. I only know we’re at the place where the plot thickens.” A collection of Strayed’s “Sugar” columns, “Tiny Beautiful Things,” will be published this ­summer.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2012-04-06,The Imaginative Arts,"“As my ideas get bigger,” my 6-year-old son once told me, “you get smaller.” Needless to say, this was a startling assessment for a parent to hear.

Yet I also count Thomas Berger, a veteran of World War II and the (insufficiently) celebrated author of 23 novels, among my best friends on this earth. Can this possibly be true? And if so, might it be pathetic, something better kept to myself? My question has some general currency, since lately some of us befriend, or “friend,” whole armies of discorporate beings. Yet long before virtuality made this gesture prosaic and compulsive, readers were in the habit of making disembodied friendships with authors. I mean, of course, in the sense that Holden Caulfield, after reading a book, expressed the wish to call its author on the telephone.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/books/review/fan-mail.html
2012-04-06,Why the Old-School Music Snob Is the Least Cool Kid on Twitter,"My friend Lily and I met in 2004 at a showcase for a record label that bartered cassette tapes in exchange for things like drawings and telling jokes. I was there to perform some songs I had recorded on my dad’s four-track using chopsticks for drumsticks; Lily was there to support her boyfriend, who was playing in a band led by our mutual friend’s 13-year-old brother. We hit it off, and after that we often went together to see bands play in local out-of-the-way venues, like the dilapidated shack down an alleyway or the basement nightclub that was perpetually flooded with toilet water. The bands were often lousy, but that didn’t matter to us. What mattered to us was that no one else knew anything about them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/why-the-old-school-music-snob-is-the-least-cool-kid-on-twitter.html
2012-04-06,The Postwar Attitude Adjustment,"I have P.T.S.D. from a violent sexual assault at the hands of strangers. I spent a long time dismissing the idea that pain can make you a better person. Around 2003, I was involved in a study with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. I began thinking about rape as if it were an earthquake or a flood: it took away everything I had when I was too young to realize I had anything at all. But what was important was what I built out of the rubble ­— that was what mattered more than the event itself. Today, I sleep soundly, I have successful long-term friendships and relationships with family and I haven’t had a panic attack in four years. I hope to see the kind of training in this article make its way to those of us who fought solo wars on different fronts.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/reply-all-the-postwar-attitude-adjustment.html
2012-04-06,Who Made Mini-Golf?,"There are conflicting accounts as to what prompted Garnet Carter, who already owned a real golf course, to open a miniature one in the late 1920s. His wife, Frieda, believed it was meant to distract “golf widows” — much as the Ladies Putting Club, built in 1867, did at the renowned St. Andrews links in Scotland. But Carter, who owned the Fairyland Inn, a hotel outside Chattanooga, Tenn., created more than a distraction. His course was different from other forays into mini-golf. It had hollowed-out tree trunks and gnomes. It was, write Nina Garfinkel and Maria Reidelbach in “Miniature Golf,” “a way of reinforcing the Never Never Land atmosphere the inn strove to create.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/who-made-mini-golf.html

2012-04-06,The Best Nanny Money Can Buy,"How often is it the case that one parent (usually the mother, but there is a small group of fathers in this category) gives up a high-paying job to take care of children, particularly preschool-age children? In those cases, the household is “paying” for their services in the form of what economists call an opportunity cost. In this case, it is the loss of the salary of the parent staying at home. If that parent would have earned $50,000 to $100,000-plus a year, that means your internal nanny service (i.e., the parent) is as extravagant an expense as an Upper West Side counterpart.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/reply-all-the-best-nanny-money-can-buy.html

2012-04-06,In Defense of Music Snobs,"Music snobbery, which Alexandra Molotkow writes about in this week’s Riff column, has, like a lot of subcultures, a jingo-laden, elitist downside. But for some reason music snobbery tends to anger people more than, say, comic-book collecting or film snobbery. I think people are doubly hostile to pop-music snobbery because there’s something elemental to our lives about music that makes it easier to be defensive if someone knows more about it than you do, particularly if it’s something you like. I’ve definitely felt the anguish of looking like a rube next to someone more knowledgeable about something I like, and the initial reaction can be anger and rejection. But learning new information about pop music is generally worth sucking a little humble pie.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/in-defense-of-music-snobs/

Having a flamboyantly gay lead singer no longer poses any limitations whatsoever on a band’s demographic reach. People from every possible walk of life crammed the floor in front of the stage, from gutter punks to frat boys, all of them worshiping at the altar of adorable feyness that is Seth Bogart and his Punx. Looking like a scrawny version of a Tom of Finland drawing, and sporting costumes designed by the one and only Peggy Noland, Hunx steered the crowd into a frenzied surge. The passion very nearly swallowed me whole. With squawking, cheeky lyrics that poked fun at sexuality, crushes and just plain sex, Hunx and His Punx are an irresistibly twisted, fantastical cross between CBGB’s punk culture and a 1950s surf pop band.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/notes-from-the-underground-hunx-and-his-punx/

2012-04-11,Norway: Mass Killer Found to Be Sane," A new psychiatric evaluation of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing 77 people in Norway last year, concluded Tuesday that he was not psychotic when he carried out the attacks. The report, submitted to a district court in Oslo less than a week before Mr. Breivik’s scheduled trial, contradicted an evaluation last year in which psychiatrists said he had paranoid schizophrenia and was psychotic when he detonated a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people, then drove to the island of Utoya, where he shot and killed 69 people, mostly teenagers at a summer camp run by the governing Labor Party’s youth organization. The new report could give judges grounds to sentence Mr. Breivik, 33, to prison instead of a psychiatric hospital. The court must determine whether Mr. Breivik, who has said he was punishing pro-immigration “traitors,” was sane or mentally ill at the time, based on the two reports.

A staple presence both as a D.J., and as the lead singer of MEN, the band she has fronted since the dissolution of Le Tigre, Samson arguably keeps the term “feminist electro-punk artist” on the map. MEN, who are known for their playfully political dance music, appear in a new costume every show, handmade by Samson.

The idea of power, or of powerful people, seems to repel him as much as it fascinates. And yet Caro has spent virtually his whole adult life studying power and what can be done with it, first in the case of Robert Moses, the great developer and urban planner, and then in the case of Lyndon Johnson, whose biography he has been writing for close to 40 years. Caro can tell you exactly how Moses heedlessly rammed the Cross Bronx Expressway through a middle-class neighborhood, displacing thousands of families, and exactly how Johnson stole the Texas Senate election of 1948, winning by 87 spurious votes.

Tiede stuffs her in a freezer, after shooting her four times in the back. Her frozen body stays there for nine months while Bernie spends a big chunk of her fortune, millions of dollars, on assorted good deeds and indulgences, buying the people of Carthage pretty much whatever they want — cars, Jet Skis, airplanes — and pledging a new wing for the Methodist church with hardly anyone bothering to ask where he got so much money.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/how-my-aunt-marge-ended-up-in-the-deep-freeze.html

However, both the shrinking thickness and lack of any evidence that anyone has been caught with a dangerous laptop render all this “security theater” moot.

2012-04-13,South Sudan: Border Tensions Increase," South Sudan said Thursday that it was prepared to withdraw from the contested city of Heglig, which it captured from Sudanese forces this week, under certain conditions, but that it was also prepared to send its army back to Abyei, another contested city along the border. The minister of information, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, echoing statements by President Salva Kiir, said South Sudan “cannot talk about withdrawal” unless contested regions were demilitarized and international observers were put in place. Until then, Mr. Marial said, South Sudan would remain in Heglig, an oil-rich city that both Sudan and South Sudan claim and Sudan has controlled since 2005. But South Sudan has accused Sudan of using contested border regions as a “springboard” for attacks on its territory. Since their split last year, the two sides have been caught in a dispute over a host of issues, including citizenship, the demarcation of the border and how to share the South’s oil. On Thursday, the United Nations Security Council demanded “a complete, immediate and unconditional end to all fighting” between Sudan and South Sudan.

2012-04-13,The Game Is Called Chicken,"From Matt Bai’s article, we learned that the two parties’ leaders can get within a few hundred billion dollars of a nearly $3 trillion deficit deal. But we also learned that, even if one of those leaders (President Obama) were to concede the entire amount of that difference (i.e., rolling his revenue demands back from $1.2 trillion to $800 billion), the other leader (John Boehner) still couldn’t sell it to his own team. Which means we didn’t actually end up within a few hundred billion dollars of a deal. We ended up pretty much where we started: With one side absolutely refusing to raise even a minuscule amount of revenue and the other side willing to do trillions in cuts as long as it got some new revenue in return, but never getting it. Unlike Bai, I see little grounds for optimism here. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/the-game-is-called-chicken.html

Outside the downtown areas of a handful of huge cities, Americans have very little access to public transportation.

I had my first period at 10, and when I told my mother, she collapsed on the bed, sobbing: “My baby is going to be short and fat. Short and fat!” My body-mass index placed me on the extreme low end of overweight. What followed were two years of bone scans, forced physical activity, a strict diet and endless scrutiny of my body’s changes. No attempts were ever made to make me feel that puberty was normal, because my parents were very clear that my puberty was abnormal. In the long run, I turned out utterly normal (and taller and thinner than average), but I didn’t feel comfortable in my own body until years after I no longer stood out as precociously mature.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/the-incredible-shrinking-childhood.html

He used to be referred to as “Flanby,” after a brand of wobbly caramel pudding, just one of a string of insulting nicknames for a convivial man considered always at the second rank of politics. He has been called “a living marshmallow” and “Mr. Little Jokes,” and just last year, Martine Aubry, the head of the Socialist Party, described him as a couille molle, a nasty way of saying he has no guts.

Soldiers who spent years abroad dreaming of high-heeled pinups, one historian wrote, came home to wives whose wartime work required more sensible shoes. As women returned to domestic life, higher heels could, and did, become all the rage.

Schoolchildren the world over still recognize the luxury liner’s name thanks to a century’s worth of books, articles, films and deep-ocean exploration. The interrupted stories of those who died on its voyage, however, and the troubled post-disaster lives of those who survived, are less well known. Two new books attempt to fill that void.

Still, there’s not a lot you could call juvenilia here, beyond a pasted-in 1972 drawing of a creature emerging from a can of “tomato monster soup” (captioned “I drew this in the ninth grade and felt incredible afterward”) — except in the sense that her mature work aspires to be juvenilia, to extract nervous comedy and pathos from the way young people explain the world to themselves.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/books/review/lynda-barrys-blabber-blabber-blabber-and-more.html

Since then she has frequently turned to her Italian-American heritage for material; her 12th novel, “The Shoemaker’s Wife,” which slides onto the hardcover fiction list at No. 5, is based on the lives of her immigrant grandparents. A couple of years ago, in a conversation with the novelist Lauren Baratz-Logsted, Trigiani said she is sometimes mistaken for the actress Nia Vardalos, who wrote and starred in “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.” “Once on a plane,” she said, “a lady asked for my autograph. I said, ‘I’m not her.’ And she went back to her seat and halfway through the flight, she came back with a napkin, and she said, ‘Either sign this or I’ll tell the entire plane who you are and you’ll have to sign all the napkins.’ So, I signed, ‘Love, Nia Vardalos,’ on the napkin.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/inside-the-list.html

When one earns one’s living and professional acclaim by being an uncanny chameleon, it is a difficult trick to step unmasked into the bright light of fame. For Jessica Chastain, our cover girl, the path from critic’s darling to world-class celebrity has been one she has trod, in my view, with care and grace. When, in February, she walked the red carpet at the Oscars in a strapless embroidered gown by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, she announced herself as being far more than a thespian able to portray anyone in any era for any auteur. (Her slate of releases is staggering.) I love that she chose McQueen for such a moment, that she understood how extraordinary fashion could be an entirely natural partner in the project of self-definition. Chastain is a great beauty and a terrific talent and, as Lynn Yaeger reveals, a lovely young woman on the verge of a major career.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/t-magazine/editors-letter.html

On Monday a program of his recent work will be shown in downtown Los Angeles at Redcat, an exhibition space in Walt Disney Concert Hall; Mr. Dorsky, who talks about his work in accessible, charming fashion, is scheduled to appear in person.

2012-04-16,TED Teams With NPR,"TED, the nonprofit group that sponsors conferences on ideas, is coming to NPR. A 10-episode series titled “TED Radio Hour” will begin on April 27 on NPR stations and at ted.npr.org, the two organizations plan to announce on Monday. The show, hosted by Alison Stewart, the former anchor of the PBS series “Need to Know,” draws from an archive of more than 1,200 TED talks, each lasting 18 minutes or so, which become the kernels for a broader conversation, Eric Nuzum, NPR’s vice president for programming, said by telephone. Each episode is organized around a theme: one pairs competing talks on the cause of happiness; others look at the power of crowds and food sustainability. Chris Anderson, who runs the TED conferences, said in a phone interview that the challenge was to “take material that was in some cases three or four years old and make it seem fresh and relevant” by letting Ms. Stewart explore points in more depth and bring in other voices. Local stations will broadcast the program at varied times; WNYC in New York is scheduling it for the summer. NPR will wait to approve a second season, but Mr. Anderson is optimistic: “I don’t think the world’s going to run out of ideas any time soon,” she said. “I would say that curiosity is a self-fueling fire.” TED is also exploring television. “There are lots of conversations and discussions afoot,” Mr. Anderson said, declining to provide specifics.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/arts/ted-teams-with-npr.html

2012-04-17,Nature Made | Kria Jewelry Collection,"“You can’t find bones and skeletons just out and about,” laments the Reykjavík-born designer Johanna Methusalemsdottir. Fortunately, Methusalemsdottir gets help from her friends and family in Iceland, who collect and ship boxes of skeletons, teeth and other natural discards to her so that she may use them in her jewelry collection, Kria. “My studio is filled with bones and weird things that keep me really happy,” says the designer, who moved to New York as a teenager and currently makes every piece by hand in her Brooklyn studio. Her latest collection, her fifth, was inspired by the cod, a fish that kicked off decades of territorial disputes and has been central to Icelandic culture for centuries. Pieces look like wisps of smoke, cast in sterling silver and tethered to thin chains. The look book stars Methusalemsdottir’s 18-year-old daughter, India Salvor Menuez, wearing the delicate and primal-looking pieces. “The coarse sweater, the knitting, it really reminded me of fish nets and I wanted it to feel like a portrait of an old sailor or maybe a Native American,” says Methusalemsdottir. “Just very organic, nothing forced.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/nature-made-kria-jewelry-collection/

Tolkien would have been downright impossible, if not undesirable. (A tale of hungry workhouse hobbits who want more gruel? An evil, all-seeing eye visited by foreboding spirits on Christmas?) But a London publisher has nonetheless found a way to get their names onto the same project, in the form of a collaboration between descendants of Tolkien and Dickens, BBC News reported. The publisher Thames River Press said it would release two fantasy novels written by Michael Tolkien, aimed at younger readers and based on stories told to him by his grandfather, the “Lord of the Rings” author J. R. R. Tolkien. Gerald Dickens, a great-great grandson of Dickens, will narrate the audiobook releases. BBC News said the first book, called “Wish,” was inspired by the Florence Bone story “The Rose-Colored Wish” and chronicles two children who come into possession of an evil sorcerer’s enchanted artifact; the second book, “Rainbow,” takes its inspiration from another work by Ms. Bone called “The Other Side of the Rainbow.” ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/a-match-made-in-literary-heaven-descendants-of-dickens-and-tolkien-to-collaborate/

2012-04-19,Post-Prozac Nation,"Few medicines, in the history of pharmaceuticals, have been greeted with as much exultation as a green-and-white pill containing 20 milligrams of fluoxetine hydrochloride — the chemical we know as Prozac. In her 1994 book “Prozac Nation,” Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote of a nearly transcendental experience on the drug. Before she began treatment with antidepressants, she was living in “a computer program of total negativity . . . an absence of affect, absence of feeling, absence of response, absence of interest.” She floated from one “suicidal reverie” to the next. Yet, just a few weeks after starting Prozac, her life was transformed. “One morning I woke up and really did want to live. . . . It was as if the miasma of depression had lifted off me, in the same way that the fog in San Francisco rises as the day wears on. Was it the Prozac? No doubt.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/the-science-and-history-of-treating-depression.html

2012-04-20,Wandering Seoul in Patterns of Coincidence,"At once direct and elusive, “The Day He Arrives” is a story about what might have been or perhaps once was. It pivots on a teacher and lapsed film director, Seong-jun (Yu Jun-sang), who, when the movie opens, has just arrived in Seoul. He’s in town to see a friend, but there’s something rootless and sad about him, suggesting that he’s after more than a visit. As one day gives way to another — days that look remarkably the same — his visit takes on existential weight, and the movie becomes an exploration, both playful and rueful, of desire, narrative and the idea beautifully expressed by Faulkner in “Absalom, Absalom!” that “maybe nothing ever happens once and is finished.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/movies/the-day-he-arrives-directed-by-hong-sang-soo.html

2012-04-20,Slice of Life in a Cage,"Spiked with energy and attitude, the nonfiction movie “Fightville” takes a fast look at a few men who, for pleasure and sometimes profit, like to smack and take down other men while practicing mixed martial arts. Produced, directed and edited by the married couple Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker (“Gunner Palace”), “Fightville” gestures toward some promising subjects — men and masculinity, bread and circuses — about which it has surprisingly little to say, despite its washes of spilled blood; its ringside seat at that great, eternal fight known as hope versus desperation; and its occasional quotations from the likes of Nietzsche and Whitman. The increased popularity of M.M.A. is reflected in the uptick of attention paid to it and its practitioners in popular culture, including in movies like Steven Soderbergh’s thriller “Haywire” (which stars the female fight sensation Gina Carano) and Gavin O’Connor’s under-seen men’s melodrama “Warrior” (about two battling brothers, played by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, and their punishing problems). In January, MTV started its run of the reality television show “Caged,” about a clutch of young fighters from the Louisiana city of Minden. In the first episode’s hyperventilated opening minutes someone explains that one of the locals “made it big time,” as the shot holds on an image of Dustin Poirier, a main character in “Fightville.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/movies/in-fightville-mixed-martial-arts-at-close-range.html

The United Arab Emirates denounced the visit, calling it provocative. The Mehr News Agency quoted General Pourdastan, above, as saying that “Iran has had sovereignty over these islands since old times and the Islamic republic will defend this right with full force.” Abu Musa is the largest of the three islands, which sit in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow passageway that is considered a vital shipping lane for oil tankers.

Seeking to illustrate the Turkish Empire’s landholdings for his statistical breviary on the European nation-states, Playfair sliced a circle into three wedges whose sizes were determined by land area. According to a paper called “No Humble Pie: The Origins and Usage of a Statistical Chart” by Ian Spence, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, Asia’s wedge was the largest and colored green, to indicate that it was a maritime power. Europe was made red to indicate it was a “land power.” It’s not clear why Playfair made Africa yellow, or what inspired him to make a circle graph at all.

Each of the 65 chapters in “Dropped Names” offers a no-holds-barred eulogy somewhere between mash note and carpet-bombing. The collection paints Hollywood and Broadway as teeming with vulgar, neurotic and irresistible company, and Langella as relentlessly affable in the face of nonstop groping by famous people in far-flung locations. He ambles into history and falls into notable beds like some kind of sexy Forrest Gump or beefcake Zelig.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/dropped-names-frank-langellas-memoir.html

Its meaning contains (vessel-like) a well-wrought urn, a far-­sailing ship, a throbbing vein. Spoken, its whispering consonants cut swiftly past.

2012-04-20,An Island of One,"The intersection of the global and the nearly indetectable, even subatomic, realms of the personal is territory Graham Swift maps with particular acuity. His sense of leverage, and of the vectors of connection between, say, the way a woman sits in a car on the Isle of Wight and the horror of Sept. 11, is exquisite. From his early novel ­“Waterland” (which interweaves a marriage, a kidnapping, 300 years of the history of the Fens and the ways of the eel) to the novel that won him the Booker Prize, “Last Orders” (which tracks the spoken and unspoken connections among a group of elderly World War II veterans gathered in a pub), Swift has used extraordinarily subtle means to talk about the way we live now and how it’s infused not only with the way we lived then but with the way other people lived, and live.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/wish-you-were-here-by-graham-swift.html

Bolaño, a Chilean whose great subject was Mexico, asserted that realism itself was magic enough to support a novel, and his gangs of visceral realists and killers bore him out.

2012-04-20,Inside the List,"ODD COUPLE: Here at the Book Review, intuition and free association play big roles when we decide who should review the books we send out. So if one novelist reviews another, they’ll often overlap in terms of tone or themes or prose style. But sometimes a counter­intuitive pairing works just as well. In 1988, Anne Tyler reviewed “Libra,” Don DeLillo’s novel about the Kennedy assassination, in these pages. Tyler and DeLillo were already literary heavyweights, but you wouldn’t have looked for them on the same fight card — DeLillo had a reputation as a chilly analyst of paranoia and pervasive social forces, while Tyler was known for her intimate dissections of grief and domestic estrangement. (That hasn’t changed: “The Beginner’s Goodbye,” her novel about a man haunted by his dead wife, is at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list.) Still, she loved “Libra,” and came away persuaded that the C.I.A. could have been involved in the assassination. DeLillo “must have had the same source materials available to anyone else,” she wrote. “But he takes the stale facts and weaves them into something altogether new. . . . That finally we’re interested less in the physical events of the assassination than in the pitiable and stumbling spirit underlying them proves ‘Libra’ to be a triumph.” DeLillo’s novel went on to spend five weeks on the best-seller list.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html

By nature upbeat, articulate and dignified, Sakuda — who died in November 2006, outlasting everyone’s expectations by living for four years — was alarmed when anxiety and depression came to claim her after she passed the 14-month mark, her days darkening as she grew closer to her biological demise. Norbert Litzinger, Sakuda’s husband, explained it this way: “When you pass your own death sentence by, you start to wonder: When? When? It got to the point where we couldn’t make even the most mundane plans, because we didn’t know if Pam would still be alive at that time — a concert, dinner with friends; would she still be here for that?” When came to claim the couple’s life completely, their anxiety building as they waited for the final day.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/how-psychedelic-drugs-can-help-patients-face-death.html

2012-04-23,Filmmaker Wins Case Against I.R.S.,"Documentary filmmakers can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the producer and director Lee Storey won her case last week against the commissioner of Internal Revenue in United States Tax Court. The I.R.S. tried to disallow Ms. Storey’s deduction of expenses incurred while making and marketing the film “Smile ’Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story.” The movie played the festival circuit after it was finished in 2008, but it has yet to become a moneymaker. So the tax collectors contended that Ms. Storey, who is a practicing lawyer when she is not making documentary films, was engaged in a hobby — not a business — because she enjoyed filmmaking and wasn’t turning a profit despite considerable efforts to do so. That contention sent shivers through the ranks of documentary filmmakers, many of whom are in the same boat much of the time. Among the organizations that joined in a brief in support of Ms. Storey’s position — that businesslike behavior and an honest effort to turn a profit, among other things, entitled her to the deductions — were the International Documentary Association, Film Independent, the National Association of Latino Independent Producers, Women Make Movies, the National Alliance for Media Art and Culture, and the University Film and Video Association. In a ruling dated April 19 the tax court saw it Ms. Storey’s way. The court said that she was engaged in a real business, that her deductions were legitimate, and that she did not owe about $250,000, plus penalties, that was being claimed by the I.R.S. for 2006, 2007 and 2008.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/movies/filmmaker-wins-case-against-irs.html

The set featured stuffed animals and props that were meant to evoke a surrealist beach party, a whimsical conceit that is perfectly in keeping with Ogden’s elegantly naïve aesthetic. Seven years later, the idea has taken on new life in “Lily’s Castle in the Sand,” an exhibition that opens tomorrow at the Apartment, a boutique-cum-gallery in Copenhagen. “Lily’s Castle” features Ogden’s paintings and clothing designs as well as an expanded collection of appliquéd and patchwork elephants, butterflies and other animals, some plush-toy cuddly, others the size of a rocking horse, and all of them gathered for afternoon tea. Ogden, who lives in Paris and designs quilts and the Madras line for A.P.C., worked with the costume designer Lee Benjamin, who outfitted Leigh Bowery and now collaborates with the comedian and drag queen Jonny Woo and the performance artist Scottee, to create the menagerie. She traces her fascination with the world of play — “I imagine these animals gossiping about who’s wearing what and who shall we invite next time,” she says of her Lewis Carroll-style party — to her childhood in Jamaica, where her British parents moved before she was born. Growing up there, she says, “gives you a lot of freedom for inventing games from nothing.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/jessica-ogdens-creature-comforts/

2012-04-26,Samuel L. Jackson Was Ready for Some Football,"One of the sidebars that accompanies this week’s cover story on Samuel L. Jackson is “Five Curios,” a short list of surprising appearances by the actor. To this mix, let’s add another, a curio among the curios: Jackson’s promo for “Monday Night Football” back in 2003. Far as I’m concerned, it belongs up there in the pantheon of sublime Jacksonian moments right between “Where’s my super suit?” (“The Incredibles”) and “Every time my fingers touch brain, I’m Superfly T.N.T., I’m the ‘Guns of the Navarone’ ” (“Pulp Fiction”). Many of the Jackson hallmarks are on display: the crazy eyes, the grin of mischief, the escalating intensity, the quick-shift vocal impersonations. And if it lacks swear words — the promo aired on prime-time TV, remember — it compensates with what, when seen today, is a different sort of transgressive thrill, a celebration of football’s skull-crushing essence. Try not to enjoy it when Jackson starts soaring: “You want to bury ’em in the turf. You want ’em lookin’ through their earhole! You want to say, ‘I like your teeth — especially the ones scattered around the 20-yard line.’ You want their mamas to say say: ‘Oh, no, that’s not my child!

Hamid, the author of two novels, is himself a traverser of borders, having grown up mostly in Lahore, Pakistan, where he now lives, with stints in London and the United States. In addition to writing fiction, he is a prolific essayist on culture and politics for publications including The Guardian of London, Time magazine and The New York Review of Books. “I’m a political animal,” he told us via e-mail. “How the pack hunts, shares its food, tends its wounded — these things matter to me. So I write about them. Fiction and nonfiction are just two different ways of lying to try to get at truths. Fiction lies by fabricating what isn’t there. Non­fiction lies by omitting what is.

Mr. Altman originally charged the man, Norman Neesmith, 62, with seven offenses, among them murder and false imprisonment. The charges were reduced in a plea bargain. The parents of the dead man, Justin Patterson, believed the shooting in January 2011 and the sentence were racially motivated. Mr. Altman said the case had elements of self-defense and was complicated by the fact that one of the girls was 14, although she told Mr. Patterson and his younger brother, who was also at the house that night, that she was 18.

But the local food thing is almost as inbred in England as it is in France; it just sometimes hides behind poverty, war or a fatal attraction to (as they call it) America.

Her dark hair was tied in a ponytail, and her eyelids were coated in metallic blue powder. In the green glare of the mobile phone’s screen, her face looked wan and worried. When the phone finally bleeped, Amail shrieked with joy and put on the speakerphone. A teenage girl’s voice tumbled into the room. “I’m freezing,” the girl said. Her voice was husky with cold.

2012-04-27,Mythic Passions,"To the long catalog of odd hybrids that inhabit Greek myth — the half-human, half-equine centaurs, the birdlike Harpies with their human faces, the man-eating Scylla with her doglike nether parts — we may now add Madeline Miller’s first novel, “The Song of Achilles.” In it, Miller has taken on an (appropriately) heroic task: to fashion a modern work of literature out of very ancient stories — specifically, the tale of the Greeks at Troy, one of the oldest and most seminal of all legends in the Western tradition. The idea of recasting the Greek classics began with the ancients themselves; Virgil’s “Aeneid” is, in many ways, both a rewriting of and a commentary on the Homeric epics. More recently, it has challenged ambitious writers like Mary Renault, whose 1958 novel “The King Must Die” brilliantly reimagined the Theseus legend as narrated by the hero himself, and David Malouf, whose terrific 2009 novel “Ransom” invents a moving episode toward the end of the “Iliad.” But in the case of Miller, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in classics at Brown, the epic reach exceeds her technical grasp. The result is a book that has the head of a young adult novel, the body of the “Iliad” and the hindquarters of Barbara Cartland.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/books/review/the-song-of-achilles-by-madeline-miller.html
2012-04-27,Social Networks of Disease,"In “Partner to the Poor,” the medical anthropologist Paul Farmer writes that “the failure to contemplate social and economic aspects of epidemics stunts our understanding of them.” To this one might add: And hinders our ability to contain and defeat them. Craig Timberg, a journalist for The Washington Post, and Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist and medical anthropologist at the University of North Carolina, have collaborated on “Tinderbox” precisely to explore these very aspects of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. They set out to identify why AIDS emerged when it did; why Africans were so disproportionally affected; and why some countries have succeeded in reducing infection rates while others have not.

You should never ask a prisoner what he did to get put in jail, never ask a widow whether she gets lonely in bed, and never ask a freed slave what happened to her family.

Luhrmann, a psychological anthropologist at Stanford, argues that this is not as insidious as it sounds. On the contrary, mental conditioning has a noble lineage in the history of religion, and even (or especially) in this modern age, it can help humans flourish. “When God Talks Back” explains how rational people living in the 21st century can believe that God speaks to them — and why the rest of us should take them ­seriously.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/books/review/when-god-talks-back-by-tm-luhrmann.html

But now he decides it is dishonest to invent descriptions, dialogue, thoughts and feelings on a subject as serious as this. The best he can do, he concludes, is to provide a running commentary on the truth (or otherwise) of what he is writing. “I just hope that, however bright and blinding the veneer of fiction that covers this fabulous story,” he writes, “you will still be able to see through it to the historical reality that lies behind.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/books/review/hhhh-a-novel-by-laurent-binet.html
2012-04-27,Inside the List,"SONGSTRESS: Carole King’s rock ’n’ roll memoir, “A Natural Woman,” is at No. 11 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list. As famous singers go, King has always seemed exceedingly nice — more Janis Ian than Janis Joplin — and her book’s humble granola-and-chardonnay prose is about as earnest as you’d expect from the songwriter behind “You’ve Got a Friend.” But King’s best melodies often have a dark edge, and it’s detectable in her auto­biography too, especially in stories about her four failed marriages. One husband lost his mind to hallucinogens, and another beat her repeatedly before dying of a cocaine overdose. “In hindsight,” King writes, “I probably should have asked Rick these two questions: ‘Why are you living in a van?’ and ‘Are you by any chance psychotic?’ ” The music gossip’s not bad, either. In 1976 King and a boyfriend were watching “Taxi Driver” on the Upper East Side when King ran into Yoko Ono in the movie theater restroom. Ono invited the pair to spend the rest of the evening at the palatial apartment she shared with John Lennon — who had spurned King at their only previous meeting, 11 years earlier. Now she finally had a chance to ask him why. “It’s because I was intimidated,” he said. “No hard feelings, right?” This is Carole King we’re talking about: definitely, no hard feelings.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The story was originally published in serialized form in 1999. Those days were hard times for Gotham City and the caped crusader: after an outbreak of disease, the city was leveled by an earthquake. The government had enough and gave the order to evacuate the city. Batman, his allies, his enemies and many residents stayed. The story, which wove through several monthly titles and was handled by several writers and artists, was compelling. The city became divided by rival factions and familiar faces were cast into different roles. (The Penguin, for example, became a supplier of goods on the black market, while the Huntress, who felt ostracized by Batman, took on a new guise.) Most superhero stories require a good helping of suspension of disbelief, and this one is no different. When “No Man’s Land” began, fans wondered why Batman’s heroic allies did not help him or the city. There’s an adventure that addresses that (in a Justice League story, they are shown protecting Gotham’s perimeter, but are asked by Batman to otherwise keep out), which I hope will be featured in a future volume.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/graphic-books-best-sellers-a-new-volume-of-batman-no-mans-land/

When the rhubarb starts to soften, but before it falls apart (about 5 minutes), use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a bowl. Then, cook the liquid down in the pan until it thickens and turns syrupy (about 5 minutes longer). This condenses and intensifies the rhubarb flavor. Add the syrup to the bowl with the rhubarb and let cool. It will keep for at least a week in the fridge.",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/video-homemade-rhubarb-compote/

2012-04-30,Nine Things I Learned From Reading Every Last Word of The New Yorker,"Let’s first dispense with the question of whether I really read every one of the 55,000 words in this week’s New Yorker. All I can say is I tried. One of my favorite discoveries was a quote from Walt Frazier. As a girl growing up in New York City, I was obsessed with the Knicks guard. Back then you could write him a worshipful letter, care of the Garden, and get back a signed black-and-white photo. Once before a home game, my friend Paul and I saw him on the street after he got out of his Rolls. We asked him for his autograph — two adoring 12-year-olds offering up a couple of pieces of lined paper — and he told us he was only signing copies of a book about him that recently had been published, and then he turned away. I still loved him. But it was hard not to harbor a grudge. And then came all those years of his jangling play-by-play commentary. But I couldn’t help but feel a new sense of tenderness when he explained himself in Talk of the Town: “When I was a player, I rarely read anything, unless it was about me. Now I get The Times Arts & Leisure section, where they critique the plays: Riveting! Mesmerizing! Provocative! Profound! Dazzling! All these different words. I like the way they sound, so I write them down and use them.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/nine-things-i-learned-from-reading-every-last-word-of-the-new-yorker/

2012-04-30,Borough Haul | Crossing Brooklyn Ferry Festival,"If there are any doubts as to Brooklyn’s status as the coolest borough, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, a three-day music and film festival named for a poem by the Brooklynite Walt Whitman and curated by the twin brothers Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the much-loved local band The National, should put them to rest. “The independent music scene in Brooklyn is the world capital of that culture,” Bryce says. “And it has a massive visual arts scene.” So when the Brooklyn Academy of Music approached the brothers about putting together a program of musicians and filmmakers who live in the borough, they jumped at the chance. Many of the names on the bill, like St Vincent and the Walkmen, are friends of the Dessners; others, like the Sierre Leone-born Janka Nabay, were chosen to represent Brooklyn’s musical diversity. But despite being organized by a pair of musicians, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry was initially conceived of as a film festival. “BAM is singular in its commitment to commissioning new work, and we wanted the festival to reflect that,” Bryce explains. “Plus it’s exciting for musicians to work with filmmakers, so we decided to commission new films and have scores written for them.” Among the filmmakers who will be screening work at BAM’s Rose Cinemas are Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Jonas Mekas, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Poppy de Villeneuve, whose dreamy, black-and-white depiction of an afternoon on the bayou, “And So, We Begin Again,” an excerpt of which can be seen here, was hypnotically scored by Missy Mazzoli. “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, the poem, talks about leaving Manhattan and islands,” de Villeneuve says. “I took that as a very literal starting point — I went to the Everglades and then the Ten Thousand Islands.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/borough-haul-crossing-brooklyn-ferry-festival/
