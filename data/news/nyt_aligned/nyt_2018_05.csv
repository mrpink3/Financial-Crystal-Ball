Berry, the defender of rural American lands and communities, holds on fiercely to a dying way of life in this collection of essays.

2018-05-01,Celebrate Spring With an Upscale Smothered-Chicken Dinner,"Chefs are not generally the best source for recipes. They don’t use them the way we do at home. Often they don’t use recipes at all. Many of them cook instinctively, the way artists work. They do not measure ingredients before cooking. They navigate by taste and smell. They respond to the sound of fat sizzling against a piece of fish, or the sight of a shallot turning golden in the heat. When they’re happy with the food, they jot down a few notes, then cook the dish again and again until it can be made by rote. The people who work for them watch and listen and smell and taste until they can do the same — professional cooking is about apprenticeship and technique. Most line cooks don’t receive formal recipes from which to cook. They get battlefield instruction for soldiers new to the front, sauce-stained cards scribbled with notes: sweat in rondeau, drop; roast, save fond; arroser fish; crash jus with stock.

Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain. And so the straw — ubiquitous in most restaurants, bars, cruise ships and luxury resorts — has become a prime example of how tourism can have a deeply negative effect on the environment.

In March, at the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong (a trade show featuring 248 galleries from across the globe), a co-founder of Microsoft sold a Willem de Kooning painting for $35 million. Later this month, a $150 million Modigliani will go on sale at Sotheby’s in New York, a highlight of a spring auction season that Bloomberg has already predicted “is poised to be the biggest on record.” The rise of this commercial aristocracy has become something of a philosophical dilemma for many in the art world: People seem more interested in money than art itself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/t-magazine/art/sean-kelly-collect-wisely.html

Shults, 56, who had wanted to fly since she was a teenager, first tried to enlist in the Air Force and was turned down. She was instead commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and served first as an instructor pilot for the T-2 Buckeye, a training aircraft for student aviators, and then flew as an A-7 Corsair pilot. When her squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet, then the Navy’s newest fighter jet, Shults was one of the first women to pilot it. But because she was a woman, Shults was prevented from joining a combat squadron, and so she transferred to the Reserve in 1993. Shults then started working for Southwest Airlines as a commercial pilot. Two days after Shults left active duty, the Navy asked the Clinton administration to allow women to fly in combat assignments.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/magazine/women-pilots-military.html

Divided into the Inner Hebrides, a coastal barrier of 79 islands, and the Outer Hebrides, a more far-flung cluster of over 100 islands and rocky skerries, of which only a fraction are inhabited, the area occupies a mythical place in Scottish culture. First settled in the Stone Age, the islands remain wild, heather-carpeted outposts of Celtic and Norse tradition, scattered with ancient croft fields, medieval castles and gray-stone fishing villages.

The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles farther west. And the phrase “favorable weather conditions” here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain. It depends on two things — “wind speed,” which is obvious enough once it’s pointed out, and “sea swell,” a surface state of water that dictates whether a boat can make landing at the bay in Hirta, the main island in the small archipelago of St. Kilda. It rains all morning as I take a taxi to Uig, the port from which boats depart to St. Kilda, and increases in intensity for the first three hours of the four-hour ride.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/t-magazine/hebrides-scotland-michael-powell.html

The Williamsburg flagship has moved and been enlarged more than once (a Manhattan branch on Irving Place opened in 2014). Now they’re at it again, driven by the opening of Whole Foods nearby, said Jason Scherr, an owner. They have added an “appetizing” section, the New York term for Jewish Eastern European specialties like smoked and cured fish, which are sold by the pound or on bagel sandwiches. They’ve also enhanced their line of prepared foods, started selling beer and wine on tap, and installed an espresso bar at a central island surrounded by increased seating. “We can’t compete with Whole Foods on groceries so we’re doing more with prepared foods and personal interaction,” Mr. Scherr said: Bedford Cheese Shop, 265 Bedford Avenue (Grand Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-599-7588, bedfordcheeseshop.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/dining/bedford-cheese-shop-williamsburg-brooklyn.html
2018-05-07,A Deeper Understanding of Halal,"An understanding of the ideation of halal is probably not something picked up at Halal Guys or some other street-food vendor. It’s more than avoiding pork. This new book by a couple of American scholars covers the subject broadly, beyond just food — the term applies to anything that is lawful or legitimate under Islamic law. The authors address slaughtering methods, ingredients in processed foods, alcohol, the global food trade (halal chickens from Brazil are shipped to the Middle East), food in public settings like schools, the growth in certifying agencies, and how it all relates to the Quran. Differing religious opinions going back more than 1,000 years are represented, as is the modern notion of “halal cuisine” or “haute halal”: “Halal Food: A History” by Febe Armanios and Bogac Ergene (Oxford University Press, $29.95).",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/dining/halal-food-book.html

Chefs whose training may have come in French, Japanese or American restaurants are often behind the stove, adding innovation to the repertory. (See Pete Wells’s review this week of Soogil, in the East Village.) The Bari, in NoHo, blends Korean and Japanese influences. Its specialty is food in bowls (bari means bowl), with a separate section on the menu listing seven, including bluefin tuna poke, udon noodles, uni bibimbap and a rice and farro “risotto.” Other dishes include an avocado salad with snow crab, and gochujang ribs with miso. At the sushi bar, a $65 omakase includes more than a dozen pieces. The restaurant is the work of Danny Hahn, who has managed restaurants but never owned one before. His chef and partner, Mason Rhee, has cooked at several Korean and Korean-fusion places: 417 Lafayette Street (East Fourth Street), 646-869-0383, thebarinyc.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/dining/restaurant-news-the-bari.html

Nearly always, my companions and I were the only visitors; the staff, who combined the roles of receptionist, curator, docent and locker-up-at-night, appeared faintly shellshocked that anyone had stopped by at all.

That faulty valve had been replaced several years ago but wasn’t working properly and was leaking again. To fix the valve, the cardiac surgeon intended to remove the old tissue, resecting the ring-shaped wall of the aorta around it. He would then build a new vessel wall, crafted from the heart-lining of a cow, and stitch a new valve into that freshly built ring of aorta. It was the most exquisite form of human tailoring that I had ever seen.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/magazine/surgical-checklists-save-lives-but-once-in-a-while-they-dont-why.html

There is very little Ms. Bening can’t do, but one of the things she does best is play actresses — the title character in “Being Julia,” Gloria Grahame in “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool” and now Chekhov’s diva of the late-19th-century Moscow stage. Irina is charming and silly, imperious and intelligent, tough to the point of cruelty and also exquisitely sensitive.

In the following century, the town’s Belle Époque charm attracted a glamorous creative set that included Coco Chanel, Frank Sinatra and Ernest Hemingway, who characterized Biarritz as a Lost Generation playground in “The Sun Also Rises.” According to local lore, it was the screenwriter Peter Viertel, in Biarritz to shoot the film adaptation of Hemingway’s novel in 1957, who spread the word about the exposed beach break at the town’s Grande Plage; soon, surfers were flocking to Biarritz in search of good waves.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/t-magazine/travel/biarritz-guide.html

We haven’t forgotten the word, and we know its meaning, but its formulation dances teasingly just beyond our grasp. Though these mental glitches are common throughout life, they become more frequent with age. Whether this is an inevitable part of growing older or somehow lifestyle-dependent is unknown. But because evidence already shows that physically fit older people have reduced risks for a variety of cognitive deficits, researchers recently looked into the relationship between aerobic fitness and word recall.

Soon she was regularly going to a nightclub in Silverlake, a spot favored by Jack Nicholson and Madonna and run by a family friend. Barrymore and her young pals had a routine: They would go up to the balcony, rip cigs and keep watch for drinks to swipe down below. “A few times we passed out up there, slept for several hours and woke up with monumental headaches,” Barrymore would later write, “a combination of the alcohol and lying with our ears right beside the speakers.” It was 1990 when she published those words, and she was 14, having already lived long and hard enough to write a rehab memoir, “Little Girl Lost.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-drew-barrymores-little-girl-lost.html

2018-05-15,When Does a Moment Turn Into a ‘Movement’?,"Five or six decades ago, a big crowd meant something big. When 250,000 people gathered for the 1963 March on Washington, or nearly a million showed up for the 1982 anti-nukes rally in Central Park, it symbolized a certain power and legitimacy, a collective coming-of-age. A major protest presented a huge organizational challenge, and pulling one off delivered a potent message: Here was a force to be reckoned with. ¶ Today, the mass protest is often seen as a beginning, not an end — a moment of “bursting onto the scene, but only the first stage in a potentially long journey,” as the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci writes in her 2017 book, “Twitter and Tear Gas.” Getting people onto the streets remains difficult and time-consuming, but in the era of social media, it’s far easier than it once was. Now the real challenge comes after the grand event: Will the passion of the crowd translate into a “movement” capable of being sustained over the long term? ¶ That’s the question being asked of the many and varied protest efforts that have sprung up in recent months. “The Parkland Teens Started Something,” a Washington Post headline noted in mid-April. “How Can",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/magazine/when-does-a-moment-turn-into-a-movement.html

2018-05-16,The Secret Atelier Behind a Roman Boutique,"Rome is a city of pockets and alcoves. Strolling its streets, you catch glimpses of intimate spaces that exist just beyond the public facades: wisteria-draped courtyards, ivy-shrouded archways, begonias spilling from terraces. These hints of private realms beckon most alluringly from the Tiber River-adjacent Regola neighborhood, known since the Renaissance as the center for mercantile activities from plate-making to leather-stitching. It’s here, in a space in the historic Palazzo Capponi Antonelli, a 16th-century building with a pebbled cortile and a stone fountain, that the boutique Chez Dédé sells the best of contemporary Italian artisanry. In the ground-floor boutique, whose walls are hung with posters drawn by co-owner Andrea Ferolla, a 56-year-old fashion illustrator and creative director, items are arranged in inviting tableaus — a retail version of the ideal Roman home. The brand’s own patterned canvas carryalls sit atop velvet-upholstered couches, and the living room’s lampshades are sewn from vintage Arjumand’s World wallpaper; the vanity’s shelves are lined with Linda Rodin’s perfume; and beyond that, there is a closet dedicated to robes, dresses and coats by the Italian line Giuliva Heritage Collection. “I wanted to show how objects could inform each other,” says co-owner Daria Reina, a 48-year-old photographer and creative director who, with Ferolla, opened the shop three years ago. (Like many respectable creative duos, the two had a scandalous affair before becoming a couple 16 years ago, back when Reina was freelancing at an agency where Ferolla was a creative director.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/t-magazine/design/chez-dede-boutique-atelier.html

By the end of the First World War, Morocco was still a colonial entity, divided between French and Spanish powers (the country would claim independence in 1956). There were no English-language guidebooks and few accounts from those who had traveled past the international port city of Tangier (“frowsy, familiar Tangier, that every tourist has visited for the last forty years,” Wharton complained in her book). It’s difficult to imagine a Morocco so unknown to such fashionable Western society — Wharton, who kept company with dukes and duchesses and Teddy Roosevelt, and who ran in the same circles (and traveled through much of Europe) with her dear friend, the American writer Henry James, was not writing about the same place that has become so well exoticized since by everyone from Yves Saint Laurent to Marella Agnelli.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/t-magazine/edith-wharton-morocco-fashion.html

Eastern design has suffused her home in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris, too — including an extensive collection of bud vases made by Japanese potters and Western artisans, who, like herself, are enamored of those traditions. “It’s something about the shapes and the way they take on color.

Some will open with a splash, like Gaspar Noé’s flashy, amusing, then disappointing “Climax,” which played in a parallel program and has been picked up by the distributor A24. If we are lucky, others, like Alice Rohrwacher’s lovely “Happy as Lazzaro,” will also open, though probably far more quietly, buoyed largely by the ardor of critics. It is unlikely that most of these movies will mean much to the American box office, which is dominated by industrial product.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/movies/best-worst-cannes-film-festival.html

We like Glover’s brain and the music and TV he is making, but we also wonder about the speed with which he’s been anointed a “genius.” Who gets left out when we apply that label so liberally to men? What do women have to do to be considered geniuses? More specifically, why aren’t we using that term for black women?

Where we go, we go eyes open. Together.” The phrase “pretty lie” recalls “The Last Time I Saw Richard,” the closing track on Mitchell’s seminal 1971 album, “Blue.” Mitchell is in dialogue with a fellow romantic, picking through the mistakes of the past, when they’ve left themselves vulnerable to partners who ultimately disappointed them.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/arts/television/westworld-recap-akane-no-mai.html

Once she unmolded it at the table like a cake, my brothers and I would excitedly cut into it, verbally laying claim to our preferred pieces.

But the metaphor is especially apt for this week’s list of recommended titles, which includes Rachel Slade’s “Into the Raging Sea” — a true-life disaster tale that’s heavily informed by the actual black box recovered from the wreck of the cargo ship El Faro. Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (“The Girl Who Smiled Beads”), unexpected motherhood (“And Now We Have Everything”) and Eleanor Roosevelt’s relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (“White Houses”). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern world’s biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor. As with El Faro, the best thing about black boxes is their ability to resurrect the dead.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/books/review/8-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html
