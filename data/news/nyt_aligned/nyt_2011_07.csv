Yet when he died in 1968 at the age of 84, he was remembered as a courageous idealist who, in the words of a tribute in The New York Times, “spoke to the feelings that most Americans have about themselves.” In other words, he was an advocate for fairness, decency, justice and equality, a man to be admired though hardly one to be voted into office.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/books/review/book-review-conscience-by-louisa-thomas.html

To be a known john is to be trailed by shame and stigma, at least in the United States and Canada. There are millions of johns, but for one to come out voluntarily — with honesty, integrity and pride — is indeed rare. In my nearly 40 years in the world of sex workers, I’ve known only one: Fred Cherry. In the 1980s in New York, Cherry sued Mayor Ed Koch for the legal right to pay for sex with prostitutes (a case Cherry ultimately lost). To ascertain if any other such brave johns had slipped my mind, I surveyed a few of my older prostitute friends. “No, just Fred Cherry,” they confirmed. (Today, I might count Charlie Sheen.)

Churchill returned it some weeks later, saying it was all very interesting, but he had already thought most of it out for himself. But it is the very genius of Aristotle — as it is of every great teacher — to make you think he is uncovering your own thought in his. In Churchill’s case, it is also probable that the classical tradition informed more of his upbringing, at home and at school, than he realized.

In Allison’s case, the beleaguered white guy is Glen Bauer, a suburban New Jersey accountant who, offended by the sight of a black teenager in a convertible barreling too fast down his sleepy residential block, swerves briefly into his path to give the kid a scare. Instead, he crashes to his death.

2011-07-01,Taking Stock of Race in Obama’s America,"Dramatic stories of hardship and injustice have always been at the center of the struggle for racial equality.

These events and many others inspired activists to press for change and convinced average Americans that change was necessary. The worst abuses of the Jim Crow era have been eliminated, but the moral outrage inspired by a personal encounter with a bigot remains the most powerful vehicle for conveying the injuries and indignities of racial inequality. Accordingly, civil rights lawyers seek out plaintiffs whose grievances reflect larger in­justices, and activists rally around people who symbolize pervasive social problems.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/books/review/book-review-the-end-of-anger-by-ellis-cose.html

But once they have done it — ditching provincial tastes and hometown boyfriends for a sorority, a fraternity or an undergraduate bohemia — they may trade one conformity for another; they may feel haunted by their former lives. No wonder teenage life, on and off campus, seems to fit stories of vampires, ghosts, the undead. Laura Kasischke is hardly the first to use such figures (as fans of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” know) but with her new novel, “The Raising,” she pursues them almost perfectly. Almost a supernatural thriller, almost a campus satire and almost but not quite a coming-of-age tale, “The Raising” is also the best of Kasischke’s eight novels, the one with the broadest canvas, the most observation, its large cast arranged with a scary economy of detail.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/books/review/book-review-the-raising-and-space-in-chains-by-laura-kasischke.html

2011-07-01,Tennis by the Book,"“Wow, what a tournament we witnessed this week, Johnny Mac! Before we came back on the air, we were both saying that we’ve been just flat-out blown away by the talent at this year’s Intertemporal Tennis Writers Classic. Some of the greatest writers in history came and competed and showed us what it means to write extraordinarily well about tennis. This tournament attracts the world’s sharpest minds because tennis is a global sport that’s steeped in tradition, and more, it’s a gentlemanly clash of wills where you’re out there alone, and the way you play reveals so much about who you are. Somewhere between chess and boxing lies tennis. So you have to be an elite writer to get through this tournament. That’s why no one was surprised to see Touré get knocked out in the first round. Sure, he’s done some nice stories, like his profile of Jennifer Capriati for Vogue, in which he hits with her. Do we have a clip from that? ‘The whole incident takes on the feel of intense aerobics mixed with a back-alley mugging, and you’re just deflecting and defending and, eventually, after eight or nine minutes, your arm starts to throb and your lungs start to shriek and each new shot racing at you is like a punch to the chest and you feel her inner bully.’ Touré’s a solid player, but in this tournament your forehand is your vocabulary, your backhand is your eye for detail, your ability to turn words into poetry and rhythm is your volley, your use of metaphors and symbolism is your overhead, and your deep understanding of the sport is your all-important first serve. Touré writes passionately and knows tennis, but some whispered that he might have gotten into the tournament only because of affirmative action.

The group, published by DC Comics, has had a bit of a confounding history. The Legion was created in 1958. They were time travelers from the future who had traveled to the past to meet their heroic inspiration: Superboy. Cut to 1985 when DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths, a limited series intended to streamline the decades of convoluted continuity of its heroes. It was decided that Superman never had costumed adventures as a youth, so the reason for the Legion’s founding had to be reconsidered. A lot of stories were crafted to give them a new reason for forming – until it was decided, 20 years later when DC published Infinite Crisis – that Superman did have a career as Superboy so the Legion could be inspired by him.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/graphic-books-best-sellers-lost-in-space/

2011-07-01,Extra Savage,"I discovered Dan Savage, the subject of my cover story this weekend, in 2004, when I became editor of the alternative weekly paper in New Haven. I did not know much about alt weeklies, and to get ideas I looked around for some of the best. Somebody said I had to check out The Stranger, the bigger of Seattle’s two alt weeklies. So I e-mailed the editor, who was this Dan Savage guy. I figured that couldn’t be his real name; it was probably some alt weekly stunt. But “Dan Savage” sent me a bunch of issues, and the paper was brilliant: smart, good-looking, edgy. Inside, the editor wrote a really good sex column called Savage Love, and I asked my publisher if we could drop our syndicated sex column and replace it with Savage Love. “Can’t,” he said. “Too dirty. People would object.” That was about all I knew of Dan Savage for the next couple years, although occasionally I would see links to Savage’s work on Andrew Sullivan’s blog.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/extra-savage/

Sex-selective abortion is wrong because women should account for half of the human population, and in parts of the world they now account for far less.

As the Phantom and Christine, Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, above, with Mr. Lloyd Webber, left, will lead a cast of 200 people in limited performances on Oct. 1 and 2. Mr. Karimloo and Ms. Boggess, who is currently starring in the Broadway revival of Terrence McNally’s “Master Class,” originated the same roles in the “Phantom” sequel, “Love Never Dies,” in the West End of London in March 2010. The original “Phantom,” which opened there on Oct. 9, 1986, with staging by Hal Prince and Gillian Lynne, is still running. The anniversary show will be directed by Laurence Connor, who has served as associate director of the London production. Ms. Lynne will return to provide musical staging and choreography. Matt Kinley will design the set, with Maria Björnson’s original design as inspiration. “Though this special staging will naturally be drawn from the brilliant original, it will be both a spectacular and unique production,” Cameron Mackintosh, who is producing, said in a statement.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/theater/anniversary-planned-for-phantom.html

In October a large church in a small town will become the center of controversy in “The Bus” by James Lantz, followed by “Any Given Monday,” an irreverent comedy about a man trying to save his marriage through terrible means, by Bruce Graham, a former writer for the television show “Roseanne.” Last — but certainly not the least draw for 59E59 audiences — the popular “Brits Off Broadway” returns to the theater for its eighth New York program. Before the season begins, Throughline Artists, a company that promotes communication between established and emerging playwrights, presents “Summer Shorts 5.” This festival of short plays brings new works by Alexander Dinelaris (“Still Life”), Christopher Durang (“Miss Witherspoon”) and Neil LaBute (“reasons to be pretty”), among several other playwrights, beginning Aug. 4 and running through Sept. 3.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/theater/clowns-and-comedy-open-59e59-season.html

In the article, Mr. Grann examined Mr. Biro’s methods — unearthing fingerprints on paintings and matching them to artists — and found some inconsistencies in his story. In the suit, filed in Manhattan, Mr. Biro contends that the reporting is “a false and defamatory screed” against him, “written and published with malice and an indifference to the standards of responsible journalism,” and that it has caused damage to his reputation, his business and his health. Mr. Biro also sued Dan Rattiner of Dan’s Papers, a Hamptons weekly newspaper, for his follow-up article. David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, told AdWeek: “David Grann’s reporting on this story and everything else he does is painstaking in both its attention to the facts and tone.

On Friday Mr. Overstreet, finishing up a “Glee” stage tour, seemed to make reference to the news on his Twitter feed: “well its been a good yr,” he wrote, “too bad its over, time for summer and starting fresh.” He also posted about preparing to record an album. But Gleeks need not despair; Mr. Overstreet may still appear on “Glee” as a guest star, according to people close to the production, and he is expected to be seen in “Glee Live! 3D!,” a movie about the tour, to open in August. Three seasons in, Mr. Murphy doesn’t intend his characters to be in perpetual high school, he recently told Ryan Seacrest in a radio interview. “The show to me is about the way you express yourself as you start to move out into the world as a fresh young person,” Mr. Murphy later told TV Line. “Do we really want to have an eight-year senior?

And then in 2000, still looking trim in her unitard, she retired. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/arts/dance/jules-feiffers-dancer-at-river-to-river-festival.html

And of its various full-length vehicles none currently shows the troupe so well as Kevin McKenzie’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” which has returned to repertory for this final week of the troupe’s annual eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House. True, the production, new in 2007, has always been seriously flawed; in a ballet that should evoke a peak of civilization, most of Tony Walton’s sets and a few of Willa Kim’s costume designs are all too Disney. The staging’s merits, however, have now come into their own. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/arts/dance/under-an-enchantment-and-catching-zs-for-a-century-but-with-both-eyes-open.html

The clapping protests are organized anonymously on social networking sites for Wednesday evenings and began last month. Some participants stand silently while others clap. Plainclothes police officers typically swoop in and grab those who applaud, sometimes roughing them up. Vesna, a Belarussian rights group, said the police detained about 150 clappers on Wednesday.

2011-07-07,WikiLeaks Memoir ‘Postponed’,"A book deal that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, signed only six months ago has fallen through, according to a report in The Guardian on Wednesday, but Canongate, his publisher in Britain, said it was still expecting to publish the book. Canongate did not provide a date for its release, however. According to The Guardian report, Mr. Assange, left, had expressed concern that the memoir could be used against him by prosecutors in the United States. American officials have been weighing whether to try to charge Mr. Assange since WikiLeaks released a trove of State Department cables, but it is unclear where that effort stands. The book deal was announced in December; Mr. Assange said he expected to earn $1.7 million for the memoir, which was being ghostwritten by Andrew O’Hagan, a novelist. The memoir was originally scheduled for publication in April 2011 in Britain, although Mr. Assange’s American publisher, Knopf, did not release a publication date. “With projects like these, you never know about delivery, and you never know about timetables,” said Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Knopf, part of Random House. “My understanding is that the book has been postponed.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/world/europe/07briefs-WIKILEAKSMEM_BRF.html

Jackie Kennedy wore a red Marimekko dress on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1960; the Marimekko unisex Even Stripe T-shirt was a fixture on the rock and jazz festival circuit in the ’70s. Today, there is no shortage of new Marimekko material around thanks to collaborations with the likes of Crate and Barrel and Converse; and a free-standing Marimekko shop is scheduled to open in the Flatiron district in the fall. But true believers should get their clicker fingers in shape for July 13, when a trove of vintage Marimekko goes on sale on 1stdibs in conjunction with Katy Kane Vintage and Couture Clothing. The perfect, plain shirtdresses, matching jacket and shorts ensembles in unfussy floral prints and breezy striped shifts all came from a single owner, a Westchester-area homemaker, with very progressive taste. When she found a style she liked, she bought it in multiples. That orange and blue awning stripe shirt a little too bold for your taste? It’s also available in ivory and blue.

There was the chance that the toy would turn into a prince, and in that case, I would need to go to Chanel to have a dress made for our fairy-tale wedding. This season was my first at couture as an adult — one married to a man, not an amphibian — with a mature perspective on whimsy. Everything is so fast now, but the atelier creations are the sartorial version of slow food. The work is green and ethical: there is no waste, as each piece is custom-made with a client in mind (no discount racks or fast fashion to fill landfills). Every artisan is properly treated.

2011-07-08,Hollywood Takes Aim at a Space Invaders Movie,"Until the studios figure out a way to make a movie version of Pong, the primordial video game that features two blocks knocking a ball of pixels around the screen, it seems Hollywood has found the most, shall we say, minimalist source material for a game-to-film adaptation: Space Invaders, the quarter-munching, index-finger-jamming classic that first touched down in arcades in 1978, is being prepared for the big screen, The Hollywood Reporter said. Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a producer of the “Transformers” and “G. I. Joe” movie franchises, and Gigi Pritzker of Odd Lot Entertainment have optioned the film rights to Space Invaders, and boy do they have their work cut out for them: whereas even a Pac-Man movie would give you a built-in roster of dramatis personae (Jack Black as the pellet-gobbling hero, anyone?), Space Invaders features such characters as the alien that flaps its wings up and down and the boxlike tank that slides from side to side at the bottom of the screen. The producers did not immediately announce a creative team for the movie, nor how much money they will spend to recreate the level where the Space Invaders turn invisible.

All men and women are shaped by the world in which they live, and it remains unclear to what extent even the figures who loom largest, a Churchill or a Proust, have precipitated or only crystallized the values or visions with which they are now inevitably associated. “Another time has other lives to live,” W. H. Auden once observed. True enough. But to what extent can a person transform a particular time, even turn it into another time? The question is anything but academic. And when a biographer’s subject is a 20th-century woman who wants to make her mark in a field hitherto mostly open to men, the question becomes almost alarmingly urgent. Is the story really about a society that has changed enough that a woman can take the next step? Are there cases where the personal triumph actually brings about a social transformation? Or do many of these stories end in a standoff, the woman simultaneously victor and victim, embodying within a society new possibilities that remain in many respects impossibilities?

The cap gun was cold against my chest, yet I maintained a grim, professional demeanor, lest my suspects spot any weakness and get the upper hand. I trailed them among the secret stores and wholesale houses of New York’s East 20s, a neither-here-nor-there area north of Gramercy Park, where I lived. The place looked innocuous enough, but was clearly teeming with crime. The businessmen I shadowed also looked harmless, to anyone but me. I trailed them at short distances, making it easy for them to notice me, because if the killer did not know he was being followed, no one else would either. I saw myself as acting simultaneously in real time and in a film noir, so I was both tracking my quarry and watching myself do it.

2011-07-08,Asked and Answered | Michael Rapaport,"In 1998, when the hip-hop luminaries A Tribe Called Quest announced that their show at New York’s famous Tramps nightclub would be their last, fans and fellow musicians everywhere were devastated. There was no curtain call, no bows taken; it just ended. The Manhattan-born actor Michael Rapaport (“Zebrahead,” “Higher Learning”), a son of the general manager to WKTU-FM (Disco 92) and then just a fan in the crowd (he flew in from Mexico for the show), might have been the most crushed, saying now it felt as if his parents were getting divorced. Others in the loyal crowd included the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rapper Busta Rhymes, whom many consider the fifth member of the Tribe. Eight years later, at Tribe’s reunion show at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles, Rapaport applauded his favorite group backstage. “Someone needs to make a documentary about you guys,” he told Tribe’s front man, Q-Tip, whom he had met only briefly before. The response? “Go ahead, do it.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/asked-and-answered-michael-rapaport/

He would make three or four copies with carbon paper and then later make more at some expense at the print shop, but each of the covers was created by hand and unique: he drew the images in Magic Marker and then collaged in pieces of colored paper cut from magazines. Denise still had Nik’s zines in a box somewhere.

McCarthy pulls on some ratty gym clothes, descends three flights of stairs and exits the building, where, when the weather is agreeable, he meets up with about a half-dozen other G.O.P. members on their mountain bikes. Together they cruise along the Mall, past the Lincoln Memorial, across a bridge and along the Potomac River. An hour later, McCarthy will shower in the House gym, head off to breakfast with some other gaggle of Republicans, attend the morning management meeting with Speaker John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the majority leader, huddle throughout the day with his whip staff and committee chairmen and conservative advocacy groups and random needy or disgruntled members until it’s finally evening and time to round up a bunch of other Republican colleagues for a dinner that can go on for several hours because McCarthy takes it upon himself to draw the others out from their professional shells with questions like, “What’s the most embarrassing thing that happened to you at college?” or “What was the first concert you went to?” By 11 at night, he is back on his office couch with his BlackBerry and the next day’s briefings, some 2,300 miles from his wife and son and daughter in Bakersfield, Calif. — and then asleep, in a federal building, by 1 a.m.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/magazine/how-kevin-mccarthy-wrangles-the-tea-party.html

Here, a video of the three-day installation reveals him applying a wheat-paste backdrop of Peter Bruegel’s “The Triumph of Death,” then painting the rooster on top.

In the late 1970s, a beauty queen named Joyce McKinney followed the object of her affections, a plump Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson, to England, where she may or may not have abducted him at gunpoint. Through the Daily Express, McKinney claimed that Anderson consented to a three-day tryst at a cottage in Devon and was later brainwashed by the Mormon Church. With headlines like “Manacled Mormon,” the Daily Mirror told a different story, one that painted McKinney as an S&M-practicing predator who chained Anderson to a bed and forced him to have sex with her with the hope of getting pregnant. McKinney fled the country in an outlandish disguise and, three decades later, made the news again, this time for persuading a South Korean doctor to clone her beloved pit bull, Booger.

In the first book to survey his ascetic half-century career, a maximalist doorstop published this month by Phaidon, the art historian Alistair Rider relates the story of a German artist who enthusiastically sought out Mr. Andre’s work at a gallery in 1967, only to become confused when he couldn’t find it. This was because the work, 100 square plates of hot-rolled steel arranged in a rectangle almost completely covering the gallery entryway, was directly beneath his feet. He had mistaken it for the flooring, a mistake that comes with the territory in Andre country, where art — as Mr. Andre has said — gets perilously “close to zero,” meant to be experienced as much with the body as with the eyes and mind.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/arts/design/carl-andres-work-is-the-subject-of-a-new-book-and-show.html

Low-culture violence is literal, while high-culture violence is symbolic or allegorical and subject to critical interpretation. Low-culture violence coarsens us, high-culture violence edifies us. And the lower the cultural form, or the ticket price, or — let’s just say it — the presumed education level of the typical viewer, the more depictions of violence are suspected of inducing mindless emulation in their audiences, who will soon re-enact the mayhem like morally challenged monkeys, unlike the viewers of, say, “Titus Andronicus,” about whose moral intelligence society is confident.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/books/review/book-review-the-art-of-cruelty-by-maggie-nelson.html

Glowing, dramatically shaded geometric planes in tones of brown, blue and green extend outward to cover a wide and ersatz wood frame in this astute and irreverent synthesis of modernist tendencies and tics. It never fails to jolt my eye or remind me that art history is essentially nonlinear and full of overlooked treasures awaiting rediscovery.

The group is suspected to have been a central player in several terror attacks in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, and had been linked to the March 2009 attack, which killed six police guards and two bystanders in the eastern city of Lahore and halted international cricket competitions in Pakistan.

The journal was founded two years ago by Paul Kominek, a musician and sometime D.J. from Germany, with the help of his friend John Roberts, an American musician who, like Kominek, lives in Berlin. “By using the topic of traveling as an overarching theme, it gave us an amazing excuse to ask high-profile artists or cultural icons questions that avoid the obligatory ‘What do you do?’ and ‘How did you get started?’ and instead ask about different aspects of their lives that we personally find more interesting,” says Kominek. The first volume, on Japan, debuted this spring. The cover is printed on textured German cardstock, the interior pages on creamy Swedish drawing paper. It features tips from the likes of David Lynch, James Murphy and Javier Peres, as well as some handsome photographs of traditional Japanese inns, called “ryokans.” T turned the tables on Kominek and asked for his own travel preferences, and his Berlin mainstays.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/the-insider-paul-kominek/

Thankfully, the owl pin designed by Alexis Bittar for Jason Wu — the one that adorned Wu’s fall peacoats and blazers — is very much real and ours for the buying, arriving in stores on Friday. Fans will recognize the owl, a k a Miss Wu, the designer’s muse and logo (“perhaps because of too many late nights sketching,” Wu says), and also appreciate Bittar’s gutsy take on it. Inspired by the photographer Robert Polidori’s book on the restoration of Versailles, “Parcours Museologique Reviste” (Steidl), the two fell hard for the contrast between grand décor and raw metals. “I love the juxtaposition,” says Wu, who calls his fall collection Baroque Sportswear. “The piece combines opulence with early ’90s grunge,” Bittar says. “And a sense of raw romanticism,” Wu adds. “A perfect complement to the clothes.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/night-owls-alexis-bittar-for-jason-wu/

And as noted in “Why Kerouac Matters,” by the New York Times reporter John Leland, even as Kerouac was writing, the author glimpsed that his kind of rambling “may soon be obsolete as America enters its High Civilization period and no one will get sentimental or poetic anymore about trains and dew on fences at dawn in Missouri.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/books/review/book-review-the-big-roads-by-earl-swift.html

It sped the bounty of farms and factories across the land, spawned hundreds of towns and cities along its routes, pioneered in marketing and managerial organization, and employed a huge and growing labor force. The men who created and ran the transcontinentals — Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Jay Gould, Mark Hopkins, Charles Francis Adams Jr., among others — were as famous in their era as such high-tech moguls as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are today.

Take Rupert Everett. The rakish, indignantly handsome Mr. Everett made his mark in theater 30 years ago in his early 20’s in Julian Mitchell’s “Another Country,” portraying a rebellious child of privilege with an aristocratic profile and a smoldering case of the sulks. As time passed, whenever Mr. Everett (who became a minor film star) returned to the theater, he continued to portray much the same person, but in a state of arrested development, like the drug-addicted, mother-fixated son in Noël Coward’s “Vortex” (1989) or a debonaire middle-aged but boyish Charles Condomine in Coward’s “Blithe Spirit,” on Broadway two years ago.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/london-theater-journal-aging-acting-and-acting-up/

Of those collected here, 14 in all, the earliest dates from the 1950s, the most recent from the 1990s. Some are reed slim, but many glimmer with the irony, lyricism, moral vision and (despite their page counts) amplitude we associate with Drabble’s novels.

2011-07-18,Asked & Answered | Raf Simons,"The Belgian designer Raf Simons named his three-day mini-festival “Transmission” to convey how the participants convert the dynamic contradictions and contagious energy of Berlin’s creative scene into art. “Transmission” is the first installment of “The Avant-Garde Diaries,” a series of Mercedes-Benz sponsored cultural events to be curated by Simons that the car company will host in cities all over the world. For Berlin, Simons selected a group of artists who are inspired by the city but who are not necessarily based here, including the graphic designer Peter Saville, the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic, the Scottish dancer and choreographer Michael Clark, the British writer Jo-Ann Furniss, These New Puritans (a band from Southend-on-Sea), the Belgian artist Peter de Potter and New York’s very own Fischerspooner. “Transmission” also features a sampling of Simons’s favorite horror films. The show is physically situated in the Berlin Congress Center, with events running from noon to midnight. Theavantgardediaries.com, a digital magazine, will broadcast the key events for non-Berliners and introduce readers to the artists involved. Simons sat down with The Moment just hours before the opening to discuss Berlin’s significance as a contemporary creative hub.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/asked-answered-raf-simons/

Mike Royce, a creator of the show, told AOL TV that he thanked TNT for trying: “It’s different from their other shows. But even though it’s different, they took a huge chance on it, and they gave it two seasons. The bottom line is that we would have gotten three episodes on a broadcast network.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/arts/television/tnt-ends-the-run-of-ray-romanos-men.html

2011-07-18,Tom Cruise Agrees to Play Jack Reacher,"Never one to shy away from controversy, Tom Cruise, below, has agreed to play Jack Reacher in “One Shot,” an action thriller based on the best-selling series of books by Lee Child, according to Deadline.com. Reacher, a decorated military officer turned drifter, is described in the novels as standing 6 foot 5 and weighing 250 pounds; Mr. Cruise’s reported height is 5 foot 7. The physical discrepancy has already created some discontent among fans of the series, though Mr. Child has publicly supported the casting. “Reacher’s size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way,” he said. The movie, which is scheduled to begin filming in the fall, will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, whose writing credits include “Valkyrie” and the coming “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol,” both starring Mr. Cruise.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/movies/tom-cruise-agrees-to-play-jack-reacher.html

Created by Eight Inc., the designers behind the state-of-the-art Apple stores, this soaring modernist space eschews the traditional “behind-the-counter” retail approach in favor of a more user-friendly shopping experience. Eight large watch tables allow for accessible, easy viewing from all sides, while digital screens embedded in walls feature informative, up-to-the-minute videos. The store also features its own Rolex boutique — New York City’s first — which occupies almost a third of the space. To celebrate the new Madison Avenue location, Tourneau has launched a new line of timepieces, the TNY series, with the clean lines and strong look of the city that inspired it. The Rush Hour watch, made from the high performance alloy DLC, features numerals and hands in vivid yellow.

Bocce — a game that can be described as shuffleboard with balls, or curling sans ice — is enjoying something of a youthful renaissance these days in Washington, spearheaded by the DC Bocce League, an organization with teams across the D.C. area and a membership roll that includes staffers, interns, pollsters, wonks and all manner of Washingtonian young professionals. They play mostly in outdoor parks and on lawns, but these sites have nothing on the backyard at Vinoteca, which could be a miniaturized village square in Torre del Greco, were it not for the condo developments towering above or the Rite Aid across the street. Such open-air surroundings are best accompanied by offerings from the outdoor grill: fresh barbecued monkfish in romesco, warmed olives and almonds, a bluefish tuna sandwich on rustic bread and assorted Mediterranean sausages. Perhaps best of all is the playful by-the-glass wine list, including a dry assyrtiko from Santorini, Greece, and a viognier from nearby Rappahannock Cellars, in Virginia.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/bocce-and-barolo-vinoteca-washington-d-c/

2011-07-19,Schools Dropping 413 From Staff,"The District of Columbia public schools has sent termination notices to 413 teachers and other school employees, including 288 for poor performance, under an evaluation system that has become a national model. District officials said that 113 of the employees had been rated ineffective, and that an additional 175 had been rated minimally effective for a second consecutive year in a system that emphasizes students’ performance on standardized tests as well as on classroom observations. In addition, 104 employees will be let go because they failed to meet state license requirements, and 21 others because they were unable to find permanent positions a year after losing their previous jobs as a result of budget cuts and program changes. Supporters of the evaluation system have praised it as setting clear standards and enforcing consequences for ineffective teaching. But it is disliked by some unionized teachers and has been criticized as doing little to help struggling teachers and not factoring in the challenges faced by those working in poor schools.

But it said it could not spare money and staff time to do so and to give the trees the protections that come from a listing. The agency’s finding noted that scientific studies showed “a substantial and pervasive decline throughout almost the entire range of the species” in the West. The decline has been linked to global warming because the pine beetle is increasingly able to survive warmer winters and cause more damage when spring arrives. In the hardest-hit areas, Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, about two-thirds of whitebark pines are gone. ",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/science/earth/19brfs-NOPROTECTION_BRF.html

The company, based in Chicago, was in a contract dispute over salaries and rehearsal hours. The Joffrey wanted to increase the hours, to the chagrin of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing the dancers and stage managers, who maintained they were not being compensated adequately for the extra time. This month the managers of the Joffrey sent a letter to its dancers, who were on a scheduled vacation, telling them that performances would be canceled unless a contract was signed. Christopher Clinton Conway, the Joffrey’s executive director, told The Sun-Times that, pending a vote by the dancers, a tentative agreement had been reached. The new contract, for five years instead of the previous contract’s three, includes a minimum 10 percent raise. “The dancers will be back in class on Monday, and rehearsals will begin, as planned, on July 25,” Mr. Conway said. Representatives for the guild could not be reached, The Sun-Times said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/arts/dance/joffrey-ballet-dancers-agree-to-tentative-deal.html

We save hard drive space for what matters, while at the same time improving the accuracy of recall.” So forget all those warnings about how the Web just makes us dumber.

The curator Susanne Neubauer has focused on the ephemeral nature of a visionary artist’s practice, assembling rare slides, photographs, taped interviews, letters and other documents. The installation echoes Thek’s work, which, like his process, often reflected a sense of transience. A cascade of newspapers from walls to floor and pools of chicken wire are meant to evoke the spirit of his 1969 piece “Chicken Coop.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/now-showing-paul-thek-in-theory-and-practice/

2011-07-21,From the Grand Bargain to the Gang of Six,"Like Jon Chait and Matt Yglesias, I’m a little puzzled by the sudden wave of optimism about a potential deal based on the Gang of Six’s just-released bipartisan deficit reduction plan. So far as I can tell, the Gang of Six proposal bears a broad resemblance to the “grand bargain” that President Obama supposedly offered to John Boehner, except that the Gang’s tax reform proposals are more detailed (and raise more revenue) and its proposals for Social Security and Medicare cuts are less specific (there’s a lot of “requiring” Senate committees to come up with budget-cutting reforms). Depending on what came out of the entitlement reform process, I suppose that the Gang’s proposal could be a better deal for conservatives than what Obama offered Boehner. But more likely it would turn out to be a somewhat worse deal, with higher taxes and fewer real entitlement cuts, than the bargain House Republicans already inclined against when their own leader seemed to be considering it. (I recommend reading James Capretta for the sharpest conservative case against the Gang’s proposals, and Reihan Salam for some important qualifiers.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/from-the-grand-bargain-to-the-gang-of-six/

2011-07-21,A First in Long History Of Newport Folk Festival,"For the first time in its illustrious past the Newport Folk Festival has sold out tickets for its two days of events in advance, partly because of a strong effort to promote the event through social networking sites, organizers said. The festival, which was started in 1959 and became famous in the 1960s during the heyday of protest songs, has sold out before, most recently in 2002, when Bob Dylan returned to perform there after an absence of many years. But in past years people could always get tickets at the gate, even on the last day of the festival, which is held at Fort Adams State Park on Narragansett Bay. This year, all 20,000 tickets were sold in advance. George Wein, the producer who founded the festival with Pete Seeger, said the Internet buzz was only a sign of something deeper: a resurgence of interest in folk music in recent years, as rising bands like Mumford & Sons have racked up hits on pop and rock charts using a folk template. Alongside established headliners like Emmylou Harris, left, and Elvis Costello, above left, the lineup this year includes hot indie-rock groups with folk-inflected styles, like the Decemberists and the Head and the Heart.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/arts/music/a-first-in-long-history-of-newport-folk-festival.html

Only one such coin has ever been sold, bringing $7.6 million at auction in 2002. Judge Legrome D. Davis of Federal District Court will further rule on a motion that the government is the rightful owner of the coins. Assistant United States Attorney Jacqueline Romero said that the jurors “understood why it is we’re going after these things, and that there’s a larger principle involved here.” The Langbord family, heirs of the dealer, Israel Switt, are expected to appeal the decision.

2011-07-22,Egypt Antiquities Department Downgraded,"Egypt’s antiquities department has been downgraded from a ministry to a cabinet-affiliated office, according to the Los Angeles Times, which cited an Egyptian cabinet spokesman Thursday. The announcement came after a new Cabinet was sworn in that did not include an antiquities minister. Egypt’s antiquities agency had been elevated to a ministry by the former president, Hosni Mubarak, in the last days of his rule; previously it had been under the Ministry of Culture. It still remained unclear, however, who the government intends to appoint to run the office. Last Sunday, officials said the prime minister, Essam Sharaf, planned to replace Zahi Hawass, the longtime antiquities chief, as part of a cabinet reshuffling aimed at appeasing protesters. Since the revolution, Mr. Hawass has come under fire for his ties to the Mubaraks and his financial relationships with American organizations like National Geographic. Mr. Sharaf at first said that he would appoint Abdel Fattah el Banna, a professor at the University of Cairo, as the new minister of antiquities, but he reversed himself after the choice drew protests from archeologists. In the meantime, Mr. Hawass said that Mr. Sharaf had asked him to continue to go to work, according to the Art Newspaper.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/eqypt-antiquities-department-downgraded/

2011-07-22,Spare Times July 2-28,"Staten Island Outloud: Bessie Coleman (Saturday) She left a legacy of firsts, but Bessie Coleman, an early-20th-century pilot, is not a household name to many outside the aviation industry. She was the first black American woman to become a pilot, and the first black American, man or woman, to hold an international pilot’s license. (Above, she’s with her Curtiss JN-4 biplane in the 1920s.) Her story will be brought to life in a reading from her biographies on Saturday at 3 p.m., commemorating the 90th anniversary of her first flight. Sponsored by Staten Island OutLoud, the reading came about because a board member who had faced sexism when she sought to learn how to fly had developed an interest in female aviators, said Beth Gorrie, OutLoud’s executive director. Coleman faced both sexism and racism, causing her to study in France. In the United States she became a popular figure, performing stunts at air shows and surviving numerous crashes. But on a flight in 1926 to scout locations for a parachute jump, Coleman, then 34, was in a plane that took an unexpected plunge; not at the controls and not buckled into her seat, she was ejected and fell to her death. Her mechanic, who was flying the plane, also died. Members of the Bessie Coleman Aerospace Legacy, formerly the Bessie Coleman Foundation, are expected to attend the reading; model planes, including a model of Coleman’s biplane, will be flown. Miller Field, 801 New Dorp Lane, at Cedar Grove Avenue, Gateway National Recreation Area, New Dorp, Staten Island, (718) 907-0709; statenislandoutloud.org; free, but spectators should provide their own seating.

In 1775, Sade embarked on a yearlong grand tour of Italy, and wrote an enormous (and enormously tedious) manuscript about the journey entitled “Voyage d’Italie.” The rambling opus, filled with ruminations on Florentine museums and Neapolitan customs, was never completed. Sade’s attention wandered to more carnal pleasures, and in 1777, he was arrested for a long list of unsavory imbroglios, including one that historians call the Little Girls Episode. Sade was thrown into the prison of Vincennes, and would spend most of his remaining life incarcerated. “Voyage d’Italie” soon joined a range of half-finished manuscripts from his youth, scraps of verse and staid dramatic pieces, none of which Sade ever had the discipline to bring to fruition.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/books/review/why-writers-belong-in-prison.html

The default format of academic research papers and textbooks, it serves the dual purpose of enabling the reader to skip to the bits that are of particular interest and — in keeping with the prerogatives of scholarship — preventing an authorial personality from intruding on the material being presented. But what happens when this basically plodding method seeps so deeply into a writer’s makeup as to constitute a stylistic signature, even a kind of ongoing flourish or extravagance?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/books/review/an-academic-authors-unintentional-masterpiece.html

The inscrutable morality in the program is cathartic for me, and it’s a formidable artistic achievement to keep the totally metaphysical conflict going. But I found it curious in David Segal’s article that Vince Gilligan, the show’s creator, said that he could not understand why someone would chose virtue in an absurd universe. The answer to this question is easily taken from Camus’s “Plague” and any number of existentialist texts. I think Gilligan is putting us on. In fact, when the debris from the exploded airplane falls into Walt’s pool, I thought the author’s intention was to tip his hand and justify the need for a social contract.

The problem with the “big” deals that have been floated to date, Levin points out, is that none of them seriously address the long-term growth of Medicare spending: The entitlement reforms being considered, from retirement-age increases to modest means-testing, will generate only extremely modest savings when set against the projected cost explosion in the coming decades. And so it would be a mistake, he argues, for Republicans to make a significant concession on taxes without getting genuine structural reform to Medicare (along the lines of the Ryan plan, or the more centrist Rivlin-Domenici alternative) in return — a policy mistake, because it would concede too much for too little, and a political mistake, because calling something a “grand bargain” would leave the impression that our deficit problem has somehow been dealt with, when in fact this round of negotiations is just the opening act for a much larger and necessarily more controversial process of reform.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/grand-bargains-pro-and-con/

But with his new installation at the Fireplace Project in East Hampton, N.Y., it appears that the past is no longer an issue for the designer who took what turned out to be a permanent hiatus from fashion in 2005 and has been working full time as an artist pretty much ever since. “Make It Hard,” as the show is called, comprises about 20 pillar-like sculptures, which Lang created after he shredded the thousands of pieces that remained in his archive. Sad as it may be to think about all of those wasted moleskin coats, lace and rubber dresses and motocross pants, “Make It Hard” is a poignant realization of Lang’s long-held conviction that fashion and art have become one.

Last year, for instance, the studio invited attendees to make videos of themselves trapped inside a coffin; Lionsgate then emailed them the result to share with their friends online. The stunt promoted “Buried,” a thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, and it was a huge Comic-Con hit (although it didn’t pay off in box office success).",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/getting-interactive-at-comic-con-with-conan-the-barbarian/

2011-07-25,Captain America Outperforms His Peers,"Superhero fatigue? Not at the North American box office, where the summer’s fourth major movie based on comic book characters, “Captain America: The First Avenger” (right, Chris Evans in the title role) was a strong No. 1 over the weekend, selling an estimated $65.8 million in tickets. That result beat the opening totals for the summer’s other three superhero films: “Thor,” “X-Men: First Class” and “Green Lantern.” The Disney-owned Marvel Studios, which produced the well-reviewed “Captain America” for about $140 million, and Paramount Pictures, which distributed it, had worried about competition from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” (Warner Brothers). But the boy wizard fell to second place in the second weekend, taking in about $48 million for a new domestic total of $274 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. “Friends With Benefits” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was third with an estimated $18.5 million. Showing continued strength, “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” (Paramount) was fourth, taking in about $12 million for a four-week total of $326 million. “Horrible Bosses” (Warner) chugged along in fifth place, selling an estimated $11.7 million for a three-week total of $82.4 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/movies/captain-america-outperforms-his-peers.html

The police said that Mr. Ifans, above, shoved a female security guard after a member of his entourage was unable to enter the hall where the panel was taking place. In a statement Lt. Andra Brown, a spokeswoman for  the San Diego Police, said that Mr. Ifans had been “abusive, belligerent and aggressive,” and that he had been given a citation. The panel was organized to quell fans’ doubts about the direction of the popular Spider-Man character. The movie is a large financial risk for Sony Pictures Entertainment, which plans a series of wall-crawling adventures featuring Andrew Garfield in the title role. “Rhys Ifans was detained by Comic-Con security after a brief incident backstage prior to and immediately following the ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ panel,” a Sony spokesman said in a statement. “Police were notified, and a citation was issued to Mr. Ifans, who deeply regrets this incident.” The film is to be released next July.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/movies/spider-man-villain-cited-in-comic-con-scuffle.html

Mr. Feinberg has argued that many claims are presented with inadequate documentation, and said, “20,000 interim claims and the payment of over $250 million is not exactly evidence of failure.” The brief also called for Judge Carl J. Barbier of Federal District Court to declare invalid the final settlements’ provisions releasing BP and other companies involved with the spill from further suits.

None of the teams with the most extreme pitchers’ parks — the Mariners, the Rays, the Athletics, the Padres, the Mets, the Dodgers or the Marlins — are buying right now, and that means your pitcher is likely to wind up in Yankee Stadium, Arlington, the Great American Ballpark, Miller Field, U.S. Cellular Field or some other place where baseballs tend to fly into the seats.

2011-07-26,Getting To a Deal,"Last night’s prime-time back-and-forth between President Obama and John Boehner was interesting political theater, and a useful digest of the arguments (“shared sacrifice” versus “no new taxes”) that we’re going to hear a lot over the next year or so — both in the presidential election and, if we only get a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, in the run-up to the next round of deficit brinksmanship. But it felt irrelevant to the endgame that’s currently taking shape in Congress. The president will almost certainly sign any bill that can pass both houses of Congress, and we’re down to three scenarios for how that happens. Assuming that Boehner can muster enough Republican votes to pass the plan he announced yesterday — which would cut a trillion dollars in discretionary spending, raise the debt ceiling for six months, and then empower yet another bipartisan commission try to negotiate a longer-term deal — and assuming that Harry Reid can find the votes to push his plan, with similar spending cuts but a longer debt-ceiling extension, through the Democratic-controlled Senate, then some compromise between the Boehner plan and the Reid plan seems like a natural solution to the impasse. (Ezra Klein has one plausible example of what such a compromise might look like.) However, enough Republicans regard Boehner’s plan as a sellout to begin with that the speaker of the House might not be able to make that compromise, in which case it becomes a question of who cracks first: Enough moderate Senate Democrats to push the Boehner plan through that body, or enough moderate House Republicans to push a version of the Reid plan through the House. (Note that Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Reid’s plan, suggesting that most House Democrats would vote for it if necessary.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/getting-to-a-deal/

The new film from Mr. Guggenheim, the director of “An Inconvenient Truth” and “Waiting for Superman,” will chronicle the creation and legacy of “Achtung Baby,” the 1991 U2 album that included hits like “One” and “Mysterious Ways,” using archival footage and new interviews.

Talks were continuing with the other two major unions at the Met, those representing the stagehands and orchestra. The agreement with the American Guild of Musical Artists, which covers the chorus, was reached in May and ratified on June 19 during the Met’s tour of Japan. Met officials wanted to hold off on the announcement until the other two contracts were settled. The chorus agreement was to have expired on Sunday, the same day that the other two agreements end: with the orchestra, represented by Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians; and the stagehands, represented by Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The guild employees received 2 percent raises for each year. The talks are being led by Joseph Volpe, the former general manager, who was succeeded by Peter Gelb. Mr. Volpe himself is a former stagehand and is considered well versed in labor matters at the Met. The Met finished this year without a deficit but has an accumulated deficit of $51 million, Mr. Gelb said. Pension funds are $78 million underfunded, and the endowment is $243 million, more than $100 million off its peak before the recession. “We have large financial weights hanging on our backs that we are constantly reminded of,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/arts/music/met-and-chorus-union-agree-on-contract.html

Schaffner’s original 1968 adaptation of the Boulle novel; the first film generated four sequels, a couple of TV series (one live action, one animated), a line of comic books and a jungleful of merchandise before the brand began to peter out, ceding its dominance to other, stronger market beasts like “Star Wars” and “Batman.” The apes had a nice run, but nothing lasts forever.

Judge Mary S. Scriven of Federal District Court threw out the drug delivery charges against Mackle Vincent Shelton, and ordered a new sentencing hearing on other charges. Florida’s unique law expressly eliminating mens rea for drug offenses, the judge wrote, is “atavistic and repugnant to the common law.” The state is expected to appeal the decision, which could leave hundreds, if not thousands, of convictions in question and affect pending cases.

A street-smart product of inner-city public schools, Slitkin worked in “special markets” for several major book publishers, until it became clear that he was building rocket ships in the belly of a dinosaur. Two years ago, he scraped up his savings and, together with two of his buddies, Stephen Lynch and Brett Dovman, created Panelfly, an app designed to revolutionize storytelling in modern times. Cryptically described as “SuperMedia,” Panelfly, according to the official description, unlocks the full potential around a media franchise, pulling related films, books, games, interviews and art together into a singular experience, transforming how we experience entertainment altogether. At a time when everyone in the publishing and media industries is scratching their heads and bordering on desperation, Slitkin is being heralded as a boy genius.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/the-lowdown-wade-slitkin/

Other films that will be shown in competition at the festival, which will run from Aug. 31 through Sept. 10, include Roman Polanski’s “Carnage,” his film adaptation of “God of Carnage,” starring Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly; “Dark Horse,” a new film by Todd Solondz, starring Mia Farrow, Christopher Walken, Justin Bartha and Selma Blair; William Friedkin‘s film version of “Killer Joe,” starring Matthew McConaughey and Emile Hirsch; and David Cronenberg‘s “Dangerous Method,” his drama about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. The festival’s out-of-competition lineup will include “W.E.”, a new film directed by Madonna; “Contagion,” directed by Steven Soderbergh; and “Wilde Salome,” directed by and starring Al Pacino. The festival’s closing-night film will be “Damsels in Distress,” the first new feature in more than a decade from Whit Stillman.

This is ridiculous.’ ” You’d have gotten a similar reaction if you’d gone to a publisher earlier this year with a proposal for a novel that went something like this: journalists on a British tabloid hack into and delete the voice mail messages of a missing (murdered, it turns out) teenage girl. Their activities are exposed by a rival outfit, to widespread public outrage. The paper in question is shut down by its owner, despite having a circulation of millions. Senior policemen, who hired former journalists from the paper as press officers, resign. Evidence emerges of illegal payments from the paper to corrupt police in exchange for information about celebrities, politicians and crime victims. Several journalists are arrested, including two former editors of the paper, one of whom had worked for the prime minister. A whistle-blower is found dead (though police say it isn’t suspicious). The paper’s owner, mogul of an international media empire, is summoned to testify before Parliament.

From stately Buda in the west to Pest’s shabby-chic streets east of the Danube, a range of new attractions show off the achievements of local artists, producers, vintners and chefs.

Klosterman notes that “all of these series grapple with morality — more than anything else, it’s the reason they’re better than the shows around them.” But he argues that “the first three examples all create realities where individual agency is detached” and questions of personal moral choice aren’t foregrounded: “Mad Men” because it’s set in the 1960s, making its characters’ actions more a “commentary on the era” than a window into their souls, “The Wire” because it’s “more political than philosophical,” bent on constantly emphasizing the way “everyone is simultaneously good and bad” in order to offer a critique of American society as a whole, and “The Sopranos” because the fact all its major characters were involved with organized crime and its protagonist murdered people for money meant that there were never any unresolved questions over Tony Soprano’s ‘goodness.'” (We knew he was “fundamentally bad,” Klosterman argues, because “otherwise he couldn’t exist as the person he was.”)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/good-and-evil-on-cable/

2011-07-29,Ex-Yankee Irabu Found Dead,"Hideki Irabu, the former Yankees pitcher who struggled to live up to grand expectations after coming over from Japan, was found dead in Los Angeles on Thursday. He was 42. Police are investigating Irabu’s death as a possible suicide, according to various reports. Irabu came to the United States in 1997 billed as one of Japan’s premier right-handed pitchers. The Padres owned his rights, but Irabu refused to play for any team but the Yankees. San Diego traded him to the Yankees, who signed him to a four-year, $12.8 million contract. His career began with such promise, when he struck out nine and allowed two runs as the Yankees defeated Detroit in his major league debut, on July 10, 1997. That start proved the highlight of the season. He was banished to the bullpen and the minor leagues, and he finished the year 5-4 with a 7.09 earned run average. In 1999, Steinbrenner erupted after Irabu failed to cover first base during an exhibition game, calling him a fat toad.   In three seasons with the Yankees, Irabu was 29-20 and pitched in only one postseason game, when he came out of the bullpen to allow eight runs to the Red Sox in Game 3 of the 1999 American League Championship Series. Two months later, Irabu was traded to Montreal, where he started 14 games over 2000 and 2001, before finishing his career with Texas in 2002. He retired in 2004 after pitching two seasons for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan. ",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/ex-yankee-irabu-found-dead/

2011-07-29,"Treating the Cause, Not the Illness","In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger helped found one of the nation’s first community health centers. Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing “prescriptions” for food — stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be “filled” at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center’s money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: “The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.” The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the “war on poverty.” But in others, we’re still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the “social determinants of health.” In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality.

2011-07-29,Great Books: Kids’ Edition,"Last July, our staff writer Susan Dominus, who was then working as the paper’s Big City columnist, wrote a story about Jenny Rosenstrach, the keeper of a wonderful cooking blog called Dinner: A Love Story. The blog contains plenty of great (sometimes Bittman-esque) recipes — for grilled pizza, say, or minty peas (and also Manhattans) — and if you have any interest in the cooking or eating of food, it won’t disappoint. But it also occasionally contains book recommendations for kids. Usually, the suggestions come from Jenny’s daughters or from her husband, Andy. But in the past few weeks, something amazing has been going on over at DALS. The recommendations are coming from authors, and not just any authors, but some of the greatest children’s lit (or any lit) writers alive. Here is Pseudonymous Bosch’s summer reading list, for instance. And here are the recommendations made by Lemony Snicket (a k a Daniel Handler, who was the subject of this profile in our magazine back in 2001). And here is the summer reading list provided by George Saunders, whose genius is impossible to overstate and whose name popped up on our own great-fiction list just a couple weeks ago. Maybe once we finish contemplating our favorite sentences (and by the way, speaking of George Saunders, there are many amazing sentences in his most recent short story in the New Yorker), we’ll move on to our own subjective rankings of children’s books.

Sometimes he scribbles a list in a notebook, but he prefers to type it into his iPad, whence it’s zipped by app to his e-mail. “I use my inbox as my real to-do list,” he said. “If a note isn’t an action item I move it out of the inbox, so whatever is in there is about something I need to get done.”",Business Day,https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/is-better-task-management-on-your-to-do-list/

2011-07-29,Block Quote,"Gone from this mid-’70s film are the euphoric bams and pows and the psychedelia of the television version; gone are Alfred, Robin, the bat signal and virtually everything that made the kids’ version so much fun. Indeed, Clint Eastwood makes his leather mask (mixed with his rough, leathery visage) into something akin to a fetish show. The film starts with a scene in a pool hall. Three roughnecks harass a group of women when Batman shows up. They have knives, but this Batman (with no real tricks up his sleeve) is a born brawler. When Batman finally beats the tar out of the three guys, he looks at the women with a vacuous stare. The credits then play over Batman listening to a cop-radio mix with Quincy Jones’s score. After the opening three against one, you’ve got the clever standoff fight of the heavyweight-boxer type against Batman; the 40-against-one standoff in the alleyway; the marksmen fight with its constant zoom-ins; and the raid on Joker’s palace. Had Peckinpah directed these last two sequences (and not, as has been credited, Eastwood, with an assist from Hal Needham), it might be one of the greatest films Peckinpah ever directed. Still, when people ask me what’s my favorite superhero film, I usually point to this one.

But it’s not even August, and the conversation in superhero-nerdspace is all about leaked trailers for “The Dark Knight Rises” and “The Avengers,” both scheduled to be released next year, or about how Andrew Garfield, that kid from “The Social Network,” looks in his Spider-Man suit.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/magazine/the-prescription-to-save-ailing-superheroes.html

The pantheon of world cinema is too large for the available space, so the masters are arrayed in double rows, one behind the other. In order to browse, you must dig and rearrange, and on a recent visit, I felt a bit like a cinephile-archaeologist or a monomaniacal archivist as I burrowed past Ozu and Pasolini and displaced a row of Scorsese, making my determined way to Raoul Ruiz. I unearthed a small cache of movies directed by this Chilean-born filmmaker, who has made his home in Paris since the mid-1970s. I also found a book of interviews from the 1980s and another, “Poétique du Cinéma,” based on lectures he gave, mostly at American universities, over the years. The title of one lecture is “Cinema as Clandestine Voyage,” which might describe a curious viewer’s sometimes baffling but frequently enchanting journey through Ruiz’s films.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/magazine/raoul-ruiz-a-mild-mannered-maniac.html

2011-07-29,The Jam | Erick Swenson,"The Texas installation artist Erick Swenson is known for turning heads with his portrayals of hybrid creatures that look hauntingly real. His 2004 Whitney Biennial contribution showcased an animal with a fawnlike body, ears of a rabbit and a nose of a dog, frozen in a dramatic stance over what appears to be a woven rug (but is actually hand-painted fiberglass). He once created a half-eaten carcass of a killer whale and laid it across a monstrous crumpled-up ice floe — a piece so well done, critics said, it could be a natural history museum display. So how does Swenson fit in here with our downtown playlist, brought to you by Sean Hanratty? Hanratty chose Swenson for The Jam’s fifth installment not only because of their shared Texan roots but also because, he says, “I’ve always been so intrigued with the sort of fantastical nature of his work and materials.

Dr. Monnett was told of the leave in an official letter on July 18, which referred to a continuing investigation by the department’s inspector general into “integrity issues.” A few days before his suspension, a long-running contract involving polar bear research by scientists at the University of Alberta was abruptly put on hold.

But Judge Lamberth wrote that the “undisputed historical interest” in the testimony, among other factors, far outweighed “the need to maintain the secrecy of the records.” The transcripts will not be released right away; the government can appeal the decision. Stanley I. Kutler, a leading Watergate historian who filed suit to get the documents last year, said that Nixon’s grand jury testimony was “a rare opportunity to hear him — what should I say? — unplugged. There are no aides, there are no lawyers, there are no spin doctors.” With the possible penalty of perjury over his head, Professor Kutler said, “My guess is he told those people the truth.” A spokesman for the Department of Justice, Charles S.
