2021-07-06,"Angie Mar’s Latest, Les Trois Chevaux, Opens","Angie Mar is entering a new stage of her career with the opening of this elegant tribute to fine dining. “This is my restaurant, not something I inherited, and I was looking for fresh ideas,” she said. Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms — bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu — this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isn’t offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. “It’s a vast departure, but what I want right now,” she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like André Soltner and Jacques Pépin; a painting by Mr. Pépin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her father’s favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staff’s Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurant’s name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers.

Sweating naturally occurs when the body’s core temperature exceeds a certain threshold (typically between 99 and 100 degrees), at which point the brain receives a signal that triggers the release of perspiration onto the skin. There, the beads of moisture — composed mostly of water, salt, potassium and trace minerals — evaporate, removing heat from the body and cooling it down, says Christie.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/t-magazine/sweat-deodorant-soap-beauty.html

It was the first book that I read as I hunkered down in my apartment at the height of the pandemic. Ovid’s cast of human and bestial characters are at the mercy of capricious Gods who constantly change themselves and everything around them into different forms.  These transformations are both beautiful and ghastly, violent and serene — a blurring of boundaries between humans, nature and forces more powerful than ourselves. What inspired me most about the “Metamorphoses” (I read David Raeburn’s classic translation) is how vibrant and visual these stories are, and how Ovid captures human desperation and fragility.  In making these images I wanted to reflect on the idea of becoming something else. Ovid’s physical and emotional landscapes are constantly shifting. I wanted to visualize the feelings we are going through as we start to transform back into our normal lives, re-engaging with ourselves and with nature.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/books/turning-to-ovid-in-a-moment-of-transition.html

Several fancy confections are included, but most of the cakes tend to be tidy loaves or single layers, perhaps with some crumble or glaze on top and begging for a glass of sweet wine. There are several brownies and blondies, some uncommonly scented with figs and bay leaves; a brownie made with cocoa is a simple delight. Most cookies are easy, made by scooping batter onto baking sheets, and include chocolate chunk with some buckwheat flour for an earthy counterpoint. The author’s photographs are lovely. The recipes I tried all needed a bit more baking time than called for (my ovens are precise, recently calibrated), so the cook should pay more attention to Ms. Ho’s guidelines for testing doneness than to the clock.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/dining/wild-sweetness-book-thalia-ho.html

His idea is to produce classics like a crisp-skinned croissant with a properly honeycombed interior, but also to disrupt the category. So there is a delicious, flaky multigrain croissant, and one made with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. He’s making a type of brioche scented with orange and star anise, another pastry filled with rice pudding and huckleberry jam, and crunchy gougères oozing Comté cheese. The space is just a kitchen with a sales counter, so plan to eat your purchases at the few tables outside or soon after you get them home; Mr. Ansel says their shelf-life is brief.

I suspect it’s the same hunger that leaves many of us yearning to know aliens: How do radically different minds work? What is it like to be a truly different being living in a similar world? The flying objects above remain unidentified. But the incomprehensible objects below do not. We are starting to be smart enough to ask the question: How smart are octopuses? And what are their lives like?",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sy-montgomery.html

2021-07-13,"As a Doctor, May I Refuse to See Unvaccinated Patients?","I’m a family physician in private practice. More than 225 of my patients have been infected with the coronavirus. Some were hospitalized, some were placed on ventilators and more than a few have “long Covid” symptoms. When the vaccines became available, not only did I and my staff get vaccinated, but we also assisted our patients in procuring vaccination appointments. By spring, more than 80 percent of my patients were fully vaccinated, and we can now offer unvaccinated patients the convenience of vaccination in our office. A significant segment of our practice consists not of “vaccine hesitant” but of “vaccine refusing.” We attempt to create a nonjudgmental, nonshaming atmosphere for our patients to express their reasons for refusing the vaccine. Many have bizarre, almost delusional reasons for not getting vaccinated. Others have fallen prey to misinformation online. Because our patients often take mass transit to their appointments and because our office is in a high-rise and because I offer telehealth appointments, is it ethical and in the interest of public health to restrict vaccine-refusing patients to telehealth appointments?

It has a mere 0.5 percent alcohol and added probiotic yeast. Today’s bottled Peruvian chicha, usually purple and made industrially from purple corn, is often quite sweet. Mr. Miranda started on his chicha project while he was an undergraduate at Fordham University.

2021-07-20,"Sarashina Horii, Specializing in Soba Noodles, Opens","The history of this restaurant, which specializes in soba noodles, goes back to 1789 when it started serving its noodles to aristocrats and the imperial families in Japan. Using the heart of the buckwheat seeds, its soba is white, making it more delicate and refined. Yoshinori Horii, who runs the company, decided that New York would be its first overseas branch, but the pandemic stalled the opening. In the warmly decorated New York restaurant, the chef Tsuyoshi Hori (the name is a coincidence) and his staff make the soba that they use. They also make more traditional buckwheat soba using some wheat flour, and diners can select which type of soba they prefer. There are more than a dozen soba dishes, cold and hot, many served with tempura and involving seafood, meats like duck, and vegetables. Several sauce options are also available.

So she acquired a few loose four-by-four-inch tiles from the man who operated the local kiln and, after glazing them with various configurations of conjoined fetuses connected at the neck, torso and belly, using four tiles per image, returned to have them fired. “I think the guy thought I was a little bit absurd,” she says with a laugh.

2021-07-22,How to Style a Table for a Laid-Back Summer Meal,"Ask any creative type about their entertaining philosophy and their answer will almost always be that their guests are the most important element of any meal.

After all, if your job requires an eye for aesthetics, you’re likely to have an opinion about what lighting is most welcoming, or whether to offer charcuterie instead of crudités. So what are the tried-and-tested practices those people stick to when they have friends over?

To plant a tree in a public place, you need permission from the city first. Many will be eager to grant it. Trees make cities more resilient to climate change by sequestering carbon, absorbing storm-water runoff, decreasing temperatures, purifying air and reducing the costs and emissions from air-conditioning.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/magazine/plant-street-tree.html

It started when a friend invited me to join her remote book club and sent along a pirated copy of “A Murder Is Announced.” The book was my introduction to Christie’s indefatigably English world of gentleman detectives and civilized old ladies, their knitting needles and logical faculties clacking away. The murders themselves are “of quiet, domestic interest,” as Christie told Life magazine in 1956: clean, ludicrous comfort food.

He was recalling the older actor’s talking about reworking a scene in which his character, the Boston gangster Frank Costello, is supposed to murder a man in a marsh. “Jack looked at that scene” — and, truly, it was almost startling how well Damon captured Nicholson’s disquieting energy — “and he goes: ‘What I did was I made the person being executed a woman. That’s sinister. Costello executes a guy in a marsh? We’ve seen that kind of scene in movies before. That’s not what I did.’”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/magazine/matt-damon.html

It’s almost fitting then that in this poem, as in life, what is missed is not what matters most, but how we might be awed by what we notice.

Kristen Radtke, the cartoonist and art director of The Believer magazine, where she publishes cutting-edge comics, has a follow-up to “Imagine Wanting Only This,” her melancholy 2017 debut memoir, which chronicled her pervasive sense of loneliness throughout her 20s. SEEK YOU: A JOURNEY THROUGH AMERICAN LONELINESS (Pantheon, $30) amplifies her previous effort (it’s longer by 75 pages), expanding the topic through extensive research interwoven with stories from her own life. Part literature review, part essay, part autobiographical meditation, “Seek You” exemplifies the capaciousness of nonfiction comics today. In the realm of fiction, the English cartoonist Lizzy Stewart’s mournful, lovely IT’S NOT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE (Fantagraphics, $24.99), nine interlinked vignettes about girls and young women, often embodies what Radtke makes explicit in her documentary form.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/books/review/kristen-radtke-seek-you-lizzy-stewart-its-not-what-you-thought-it-would-be-anne-carson-trojan-women.html

Eagle-eyed readers may notice that this tale of gin-soaked backwoods Cape Cod is dedicated to the author’s grandmother Muriel Maurer Cowley, “whose fierce love never wavered.” Fun fact: Heller’s grandfather Malcolm Cowley was a renowned critic, historian, editor, poet, essayist and regular Book Review presence, who died in 1986 at the age of 90. In a 1973 item about one of Cowley’s books, “Works and Days of the Lost Generation,” William Styron quoted his take on the shape and meaning of a literary legacy: “A generation is no more a matter of dates than it is one of ideology. A new generation does not appear every 30 years. … It appears when writers of the same age join in a common revolt against the fathers and when, in the process of adopting a new lifestyle, they find their own models and spokesmen.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/books/review/the-paper-palace-miranda-cowley-heller.html
