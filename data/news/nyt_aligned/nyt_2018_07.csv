The roads — a pure, unpaved hell — tended to discourage folks. Fifty, maybe 60, people a day made the four-mile drive from the highway to the front gate, where many simply turned around and headed back the way they came.

Two decades ago, Thorn was invited to throw out a first pitch at a minor-league game. The ball bounced before reaching the catcher. “It was the mound that got me,” says Thorn, who still finds himself mentally replaying that one ungainly lob. If you’ve never thrown off a mound, don’t: The elevation will mess up your aim. Instead, stand in front of it, which also shortens the distance to home plate from 60 feet 6 inches to around 50 feet, increasing the odds that your ball will make it to the catcher.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/magazine/how-to-throw-out-a-ceremonial-first-pitch.html

Hall, who died on June 23, left behind a rich collection of poetry that earned him a National Medal of the Arts and a term as poet laureate of the United States. In his last memoir, he writes of life as he approached 90, with all its joys (like solitude or the ability to speak one’s mind fully) and its losses (like the death of his wife, the poet Jane Kenyon). THE BATTLE FOR PARADISE By Naomi Klein. (Haymarket, paper, $9.95.) Hurricane Maria left more than destruction in its wake. There is now a brewing political conflict over how to rebuild Puerto Rico, the subject of Klein’s investigation in this slim book. On one side are what she calls the “disaster capitalists” looking for a profit, and on the other, local communities. THE WILLIAM H. GASS READER By William H. Gass. (Knopf, $40.) A doorstop that celebrates the life of the experimental writer, this collection brings together over 50 examples of Gass’s work — essays, criticism, short stories and novels. All heady and mysterious. TRANS LIKE ME By CN Lester. (Seal Press, paper, $16.99.) A British transgender rights activist and singer-songwriter, Lester uses these witty essays to help undermine some persistent myths. For example, Lester finds a long history of the use of “they” to describe a person who doesn’t fit into one gender or another, with examples dating to Shakespeare and Jane Austen.

This liberation, he imagined, would be achieved not in the glare of daylight, but rather under the brooding, protective cover of night. Inverting a dominant literary conceit, blackness and not whiteness functioned as a metaphor for hope and transcendence — a “Night coming tenderly/Black like me,” as Mr. Hughes wrote, that abetted the struggle for racial equality and justice.",Lens,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/lens/escaping-to-freedom-in-the-shadows-of-the-night.html

Oddballs, misfits, sad sacks, melancholy, messed-up families — by now we know, or think we know, exactly what we’re going to get. Nor has Tyler made much of an effort to publicize herself.

Wielgus likes to spend time in the backwoods of the American West that lie off the edge of most tourist maps, and he dresses the part: motorcycle leathers, tattoos on both forearms, the stringy hairs of a goatee dangling like lichen from his lower lip. Atop his bald head he often wears a battered leather bush hat of the type seen at Waylon Jennings concerts. A Camel smolders in his face like a fuse. The first time I called him, he told me that he couldn’t chat because he was riding his Harley home from the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/magazine/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-wolf-scientist.html

Swarming onto the open-air property in late May, officers from the Royal Thai Police found undocumented workers from Laos and Myanmar engaged in dangerous work that exposed them to blasts of toxic fumes and dust — a common hazard on the lowest rung of their illegal and booming international trade. The products these workers handled, however, were not heroin or methamphetamines but vast piles of discarded computers, electrical wires and circuit boards.

Skip the chaos and check out Little Collins Street, one block away, one of Melbourne’s many laneways — the Aussie term for side streets, inner alleys, and arcades — that are chock-full of funky, independent boutiques, many showcasing the works of Australian designers.

The primary crime is the “coldblooded assassination” of a police officer, who’s picked off by a professional sharpshooter. The authorities in the town of White River are supposedly knocking themselves out to solve the case, but the widow has her doubts and asks Gurney to conduct his own inquiries. So when there’s a second sniper killing of a cop, he suspects a link to the victims’ secret investigation of corruption in their department.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/books/review/white-river-burning-io-john-verdon.html

2018-07-06,Tom Wolfe’s Lesser Known Career as a Cartoonist,"Tom Wolfe, who died on May 14, had a lesser-known but not-so-secret passion: He loved to draw caricatures and cartoons with the same incisive, sarcastic wit that came through in his written social commentary. His pictures were inspired by the turn-of-the-century German Jugendstil (“youth style,” or Art Nouveau), graphic artist provocateurs who regularly outraged both bourgeois and aristocratic Junker classes by poking holes in their masks and debunking their pretensions in the notorious weekly satirical journal Simplicissimus (also known as Der Simpl in the 1940s). He also owed a debt to his favorite visual trickster, Ronald Searle, whom Wolfe praised as a “giant of the graphic netherworld” on the front page of a 1981 Times Book Review. Wolfe surprisingly identified as much as a cartoonist as he did a writer, and many of his drawings were captioned. In 1979, the same year that “The Right Stuff” was published, he wrote the introduction to an exhibition catalog I edited on Simplicissimus. “Caricaturists, as any caricaturist can tell you,” he wrote, “live, work and die in a shantytown scarcely visible from that monumental Brasília known as the world of art.” He was referring to his own inclination for the comic art form, which he started practicing in 1956 at The Springfield Union (the predecessor of The Republican) in Massachusetts. He continued: “The few miserable souls in the fine art classes who are interested in caricature pass around pictures by the artists they admire, quietly, by hand, as if in some Novosibirsk samizdat network.” He likened his first introduction to the work of the master graphistes from Der Simpl, at the Union in 1959, to having discovered another planet “where, as in science fiction novels, the creatures were more enlightened than those on earth.” In 1980, Wolfe emerged from his self-imposed netherworld with “In Our Time,” his book of mocking sketches and stinging essays about the 1970s’ absurd fashions, trendy morals and silly conceits. The drawings from that book reprinted here pay overt homage to the style of the period, but even more to the audacity of its artists to subversively — often savagely — lampoon their targets while still leaving them laughing and wanting more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/books/review/tom-wolfe-cartoons.html

What it actually is is the reflection of what those makers do in their daily lives, how little they hang out with people of different skin tones.

In early October, the dining facilities at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a neo-Classical landmark built in 1928, will be the first component of the Frank Gehry-led redesign of the museum’s interior to open to the public. Mr. Gehry was selected for the renovation in 2006, but the wheels for the master plan didn’t start turning until 2010. (The whole project will be completed by 2020.) A 76-seat restaurant called Stir, to be run by Starr Catering, which came up with the restaurant’s name, will be warmly wood-paneled in Douglas fir, with a ceiling that undulates, Gehry-style. Central to the ceiling is a gridlike sculpture of curved crisscrossed slats and beams.  Mr. Gehry’s contribution to the restaurant includes the tables and chairs, but not the tableware. The chef Mark Tropea, a former chef for residents of 15 Central Park West, an apartment tower in New York, will preside over the open kitchen. He plans to offer seasonal fare with strong local connections, like Kennett Square mushrooms, Barnegat scallops and a burger topped with Lancaster Cheddar. A new, enlarged cafeteria, also run by Starr Catering, is part of the plan. The dining options do not have an outside entrance, so museum admission is required for entry. “We envision it as part of a total museum experience,” Gail Harrity, the museum’s chief operating officer, wrote in an email.  Stir will open only during museum hours, so just lunch and brunch will be served; the cafeteria will be open from morning until late afternoon.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

In May, a Harvard-funded, household-based survey calculated that the death toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is likely 70 times greater than the official estimate. The study put the number of deaths at 4,645. This inspired a Puerto Rican journalist, Gloribel Delgado Esquilín, to co-found Proyecto 4645, a social-media-based movement to promote healing for the relatives of unrecognized victims of the hurricane. The project created an installation in front of Puerto Rico’s Capitol with hundreds of the dead’s shoes, calling on the island’s governor to recognize the real magnitude of the devastation.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/opinion/contributors/hurricane-maria-killed-our-loved-ones-we-want-closure.html

Tolkien uses amply throughout the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy was the product of almost 40 years of what the English author once referred to as his “secret vice”: glossopoeia, or language creation. As Carl F. Hostetter writes in an essay in Catherine McIlwaine’s “Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth,” his was a labor “performed and preserved on thousands of manuscript pages containing Tolkien’s minutely detailed description and unceasing elaboration (and revision) of not just one but rather of a family of invented languages, which can be collectively called the Elvish tongues.” Although not alone in this practice, Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another “by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species.” Tolkien drew this partial table of sound-correspondences among five Elvish languages — Qenya, Telerin, Noldorin, Ilkorin and Danian — around 1940.

Books require that people recount their emotions; documentaries require that people bare the same emotions in front of a film crew.

2018-07-17,Room With Quite a View: Danny Meyer’s Manhatta ,"Simply entering the building to dine at Manhatta, the new downtown restaurant from Danny Meyer and his Union Square Hospitality Group (in partnership with Fosun International, a Chinese company), suggests that this will be no ordinary experience. Manhatta has its own street entrance and a plush lobby leading to dedicated elevators. Up you go to the 60th floor, the entirety of which is given over to the restaurant and the Bay Room, a spacious private event space (Mr. Meyer’s first) that abuts it. It’s worth going at least for a drink at the commanding 40-foot black walnut bar, which, like the restaurant, has sweeping views of the city and New Jersey. (There’s no back bar lined with bottles, lest they interfere. And the décor is suitably understated, with dark wood furnishings and bronze accents that would suit a tavern.) If you tire of the panorama, there’s a gleaming open kitchen, with Jason Pfeifer, the executive chef, and his team at work. Though Mr. Pfeifer was last seen in the kitchen Maialino, here he looks more to France than to Italy. The well-tailored informality and emphasis on seasonality have much in common with Mr. Meyer’s flagship Union Square Cafe. “At Manhatta, there’s less emphasis on California and the Mediterranean,” Mr. Pfeifer said. The evening menu offers peekytoe crab salad with leeks and artichokes, a French onion burger, duck tortellini in consommé and classic veal blanquette. Lunch is coming soon. Chocolate mousse, a vanilla soufflé and blackberries with walnut gelato and sabayon cater to the sweet tooth. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Manifesto, a men’s salon in London’s Clerkenwell neighborhood, is ushering in a refreshing new take on the men’s grooming experience. “At a time when barbershops were looking back to the past for inspiration, we wanted to look to the future,” says Michael Pearson, who co-founded Manifesto in 2016 with the idea to offer clients natural-looking haircuts that are easy to style. If it weren’t for the salon’s half dozen Japanese-made brown-leather barber chairs, the brick-walled industrial space could easily be mistaken for an art gallery or one of the area’s many design shops — and that’s the point. “We created a space that takes into consideration the whole experience of a haircut,” says Pearson.

In 2015, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation: Everyone, regardless of age, should restrict his or her sugar intake to less than 10 percent of all calories consumed daily. For young children, that would mean no more than about 45 grams of sugar a day. Of course, few young children are responsible for their own diets or can be expected to capably monitor their sugar consumption. That oversight usually falls to a parent. And a recent study published in the International Journal of Obesity suggests that most of us, alas, are not adept at estimating how much sugar is in some common foodstuffs.",Well,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/well/parents-kids-sugar-food.html

Each style in the small collection is made in a limited edition of 50. “We like the idea that you won’t find anyone with the same swimsuit next to you at the beach,” says Lansom. The designers cut their thin-strapped one-pieces and high-waisted bikinis in simple silhouettes and use colors that “will never be out of fashion” — such as olive green, navy and burgundy. Unconcerned about trends, the designers focus their attention on fit. “Our garments don’t fit small like many swimwear brands. We are trying to make swimwear that is inclusive,” says Lansom. “Mathilde and I are different shapes, and we will never stop until each piece fits us both.” Their look books are similarly diverse, featuring nonmodels with a range of body types — and none of the imagery is retouched. “We are just casting girls we think are beautiful in very different ways,” Lansom says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/t-magazine/fashion/five-minimalist-swimwear-brands-to-know.html

The magnetic polarity of the earth totally reverses every once in a while, too, we may as well add. The most basic consequences of the facts of our natural world can read as far more magical than any spirit or bending spoon, save we so rarely see nature in that way — for what it is.

A good crowd was on hand, and after the reading there was a long signing line at the end of which stood a woman clutching an advance reader’s edition of the book. She’d been a fan for a long time, she told me, her voice quivering with suppressed rage, and what she wanted me to explain was: How could I? How could I trade on the grief and loss of people like her for money?

Andrew McClure and Aidan Altman, Brooklyn-based entrepreneurs, use it in their FabaButter, a vegan, nondairy butter substitute they’ve just begun selling. Coconut oil is another key component. With 84 percent fat, it is a reasonably effective substitute for butter. It’s spreadable and can be melted for sauces or softened for frosting. It is effective for sautéing and even browns. The 450-degree smoke point is higher than butter’s. I found that it softens faster than butter at room temperature and for a pie shell, the dough was a bit softer and more delicate to handle, but the result was tender and flaky.

Inside, there are 36 copper pot stills, space for 300,000 maturing casks and a library of nearly 1,000 bottles.

During the ride, Woodard, who was black, asked the bus driver if he would have time to “take a piss” at the next stop. The driver, objecting to Woodard’s language, said, “Boy, go on back and sit down and keep quiet and don’t be talking out so loud.” Fresh from serving his country in wartime, the soldier shot back: “Goddamn it, talk to me like I’m talking to you. I’m a man just like you.” An hour later during a scheduled stop in Batesburg, S.C., the incensed bus driver called over local law-enforcement officers, telling them that the soldier’s foul mouth offended a white female passenger. The police confronted Woodard and dragged him out of sight of the other passengers to unleash a barrage of baton strikes and punches to the face that ruptured his eyeballs. Still in uniform, he was taken to jail and held overnight. The next morning, his eyesight now permanently gone, the police gave him a hot towel and some eye drops and left him at the nearest veterans’ hospital.

As a testament to the designers’ laid-back Hawaiian sensibility, the brand offers board shorts — a classic surfer’s style of swimsuit — only in understated colorways and in trimmer, more tailored fits. “One of our biggest inspirations is surf history here in Hawaii,” Serrao says. “We’re recreating those original board shorts that were made of durable materials and made to last.” What’s more, having the drawstring hidden within the waistband lends the trunks a clean silhouette. For Serrao, the option to have a more subdued trunk without any outlandish print or color is a matter of cultural immersion. “It becomes the situation of the local versus the tourist,” he says. “To be local is to blend in and not stand out too much: Especially in Hawaii, you never want to appear like you’re trying too hard.” $118, salvagepublic.com",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/t-magazine/fashion/easy-mens-swimwear.html

And the roadblocks are compounded when a place to eat also involves a fully equipped ice cream factory and bakery, as in the case of Ample Hills Creamery Factory and Museum. The location was one of the complications that pushed the opening back the best part of a year. Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the owners, who founded the company in Prospect Heights seven years ago, were dealing with raw space. “We had to build the infrastructure from scratch,” Mr. Smith said. They also had to switch architects midstream. The new 15,000-square-foot facility, with a scoop shop and counters in front and behind it, a playroom and an interactive museum of ice cream, is built into Beard Street Warehouses. Part of a series of brick storerooms from the mid-19th century, the warehouses were once used to hold goods like cotton and coffee. The space has allowed Ample Hills to improve production with the capacity to churn out 500,000 gallons a year (right now they’re at 50,000). In place of batch freezers, there is now a continuous system. Mix-ins like cookie pieces made in the bakery are added automatically and pints are filled by machine, not by hand. Mr. Smith said that, if anything, this industrialization should enhance the ice cream’s texture. And though the company is now able to deliver pints to many more retail shops, Mr. Smith said they would keep opening scoop shops, adding, “We don’t just want to be pints in grocery stores.” Los Angeles will have an Ample Hills in the fall, followed by another one on Prospect Park West, to bring the total to 13.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html
