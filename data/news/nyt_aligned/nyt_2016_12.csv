They weren’t just cheese puffs; they were her Burgundian birthright, well-salted dairy fat given airy form, and her mother’s recipe had never failed her before.

She managed a smile, then said: “You know, Americans give you credit for trying things.

It attracted scientists, the news industry and entertainers. It generated its own forms of commerce, wealth and celebrity and, for a while, inspired its own architecture, the luxurious movie palace. It was itself the focus of constant innovation, from the advent of sound, color and 3-D, to digitalization, which let smartphones and other devices incorporate both filmless cameras and small screens — hand-held movie palaces. And from the very beginning, creative people of all types grasped the cinema as an artistic outlet that would transform traditional storytelling and popular culture while giving a new focus to the international avant-garde.

2016-12-02,Review: A Woman’s Horrific Unraveling in ‘The Eyes of My Mother’,"From the very first shot, Nicolas Pesce’s “The Eyes of My Mother” unsettles as a broken woman staggers along a deserted country road before collapsing in front of an oncoming truck. It will be a long time before we learn who she is or what has happened to her; meantime, there are more than enough horrors to keep us occupied.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/movies/the-eyes-of-my-mother-review.html
2016-12-02,Review: ‘The Duelist’ Is a Good Shot. A Very Good Shot.,"The Russian-born author Vladimir Nabokov more than once complained about the conventions of depicting Russian duels in non-Russian works of art — noblemen with their backs turned to each other, walking 10 paces ahead, and so on. Not how it was done, the great writer insisted. “The Duelist,” a Russian-made picture about a former nobleman making his living as a proxy in honor-restoring matches of shooting skill, never shows such a duel. In this movie, directed by Aleksey Mizgirev and set in 1860 St. Petersburg, the fighters meet at close range, sometimes stand separated by a screen, and face off in other visually interesting ways. I still don’t think Nabokov would have approved — he had better taste in movies.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/movies/the-duelist-review.html

On June 21, 1964, two lost giants of the Delta blues, Skip James and Son House, were found by separate crews of obsessed music fans after weeks of amateur sleuthing along the back roads of Mississippi. James and House had each made a handful of recordings in the ’30s and ’40s, and then faded into obscurity until the folk revival of the early ’60s piqued the interest of students and coffeehouse guitar pickers in the college towns of the North.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/movies/two-trains-runnin-review.html

More recently, the clothing line Alice & Olivia, in conjunction with the Basquiat estate, produced graphic printed skirts paying tribute to the artist, while the Japanese retailer Uniqlo delivered Basquiat T-shirts. Beyond that, the Museum of Modern Art is currently reprising “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency,” Nan Goldin’s visual confessional of indulgence and torment, a defining artistic achievement of the ’80s whose themes — violence among intimates, AIDS, the reimagining of family — were totemic to the period.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/nyregion/aids-activism.html

2016-12-02,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"In Bed: We can affectionately tease Paulo Coelho, right? For one thing, the man seems impervious to it — his novel “The Alchemist,” after all, has sold more than 65 million copies even though it’s essentially a collection of motivational bromides. (“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are.” This meets the fortune cookie test: It would be improved by adding “in bed.”) For another thing, Coelho seems to be in on the joke. Here’s part of the biographical note from his latest novel, “The Spy,” new at No. 18 on the extended hardcover fiction list: “He has flirted with death, escaped madness, dallied with drugs, withstood torture, experimented with magic and alchemy, studied philosophy and religion, read voraciously, lost and recovered his faith, and experienced the pain and pleasure of love. In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces.” If this isn’t meant at least 50 percent in jest — again, it helps to append “in bed” to each item — then Coelho’s pharmacological dalliance may not be entirely a thing of the past.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

2016-12-05,All the City’s a Stage,"High on the wall of a brick building in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, a jaunty terra cotta troubadour forever plays his accordion and opens his mouth in wordless song. Peering from the window of Bergdorf Goodman, an emerald green gorilla made from feathers and sequins surveys a mystifyingly fortified Fifth Avenue outside Trump Tower, as though across an unbridgeable abyss. A fellow rider on the E train clasps a service dog that, as she also does, has a symbolic safety pin stuck to its coat. Jangled by the election and left off kilter in the last month, a walker in the city still found some assurance in the beautiful, if faded, hard structures and in the perennial urban pleasure of watching New Yorkers interact. Who is he searching for, the man who daily takes up a position on Eighth Avenue in his sculptural greatcoat? What do they see, the man on the subway gazing adoringly at the woman in the faux leopard topcoat, the woman peering into the dark tunnel? It really doesn’t matter. Every instant, some new narrative is composing itself and as quickly dissolving, with only the shutter of an iPhone to record that it ever occurred.",Fashion & Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/fashion/one-look-a-day-new-york-street-photography.html

I’ve enjoyed the incomparably rich and meaty dish since, at Le Grand Véfour in Paris and at Daniel in New York. It’s made from the meat of the hare, stuffed with pork jowl, foie gras, the hare’s innards, and its blood, and even chocolate. Lately, it seems to have become an inspiration for chefs. At Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, Massimo Bottura, the chef, has based a dessert on it, even including a layer of foie gras. “It has all the spices and encompasses everything in every taste,” Mr. Bottura said. In New York, Frédéric Duca, the chef at Racines NY, is preparing a limited number of portions through the end of the month. It takes him at least three days of boning, marinating, stuffing, poaching and saucing two big hares to make about 20 portions, which gleam in a cloak of mahogany sauce: Lièvre à la royale, $60 a portion (call ahead for availability), Racines NY, 94 Chambers Street (Church Street), 212-227-3400, racinesny.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/dining/lievre-a-la-royale-racines-ny.html

2016-12-06,What You Missed at Miami Art Week,"Art Basel Miami Beach, the art fair held every December, is often a denial of the real world. It’s where most galleries bring out the safe bets from their inventory to help cover their overhead while the surrounding city becomes curiously functionless, overtaken by satellite events and the corporate branding that comes with them. The streets and all of Miami’s glossy hotels become clogged by practiced displays of hedonism. This year’s fair, coinciding with a tumultuous presidential election and Miami playing host to an outbreak of Zika virus, turned out to be an odd buffer to such frivolity. Is there still a place for the escapism that has sustained Art Basel since its inception? If the world ends, is it still all right to party?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/t-magazine/art-basel-miami-2016.html

Even finding a name was, as he put it, “a struggle.” (It’s the street in the Fordham section of the Bronx where his father lived.) The spacious double storefront from 1848, on the increasingly attractive stretch of Eighth Street west of Fifth Avenue, looks as if it was worth the wait. Whitewashed brick walls contain a barroom and a bilevel dining room decorated simply, with a nod to midcentury modern. Mr. Kluger’s food is seasonal and market driven. And it builds on his experience working with chefs like Floyd Cardoz at Tabla, which shapes the flavors in his suckling pig and on his cauliflower with Indian seasonings, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten at ABC Kitchen, which inspired a vegetable focus on the menu. Local sourcing is so important to him that he’s grinding wheat from upstate for pasta extruded in-house.

But there are two things I recall with exceptional clarity: Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow (the hunger, the cold, the sleeping bags made of horse carcasses), and the opening soliloquy of “Richard III,” which I was required to memorize for English class at 16. I took this request very seriously, because I was not cool, and I spent many days slinking up and down the corridors hissing, “I am determined to prove a villain” to myself and narrowing my eyes.

At highflier temples of Montreal gastronomy like Au Pied de Cochon (and at New York outposts, like M. Wells Steakhouse in Queens), you’ll find a great variety of meats in the tourtières, and occasionally slices of truffle or coins of foie gras. The classic accompaniment is a fruit ketchup or green-tomato relish, something piquant and bright against the rich, cinnamon-and-clove-scented taste of the meat, the vague porkiness of the dough.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/a-french-canadian-christmas-carol.html

The exhibition “Syria: A Living History,” at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, is here to remind us of that past. The show features just 48 objects, but it encompasses centuries, and much of the work is choice. The earliest piece, a stone sculpture that looks abstract except for two pairs of staring eyes, dates from around 3200 B.C. An exquisitely carved ivory lion’s head from the eighth or ninth century B.C. has roots in Near Eastern visual traditions shared with Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Christian, Jewish and Islamic influences also came into play and mingled. Throughout all of this, there were periods of murderous struggle. More remarkable, there were even longer stretches of multicultural peace. By closing with contemporary Syrian works, the show suggests that, against all present evidence, there could be peace again.

The characters’ rapport and repartee (rapportee?) were like throwbacks to the great “Thin Man” movies, and the series cultivated such a literary vibe during its original seven-year run that websites compiled vast reading lists from its allusions. All of which is to say: When I told my wife that Lauren Graham, who played Lorelai Gilmore, would be appearing at the 92nd Street Y in New York to promote her memoir, “Talking as Fast as I Can” (new at No. 3 on the hardcover nonfiction list), we were there in a trice. Picture William Shatner speaking to a crowd of “Star Trek” fans, only 98 percent female, and you’ll get the idea: lots of fellowship and laughter and screaming, with the center of attention gamely baffled and entertained by it all. “I love you, Lauren!” one woman shouted, and Graham, grinning widely at the sea of cellphone flash bulbs, deadpanned, “I love your adherence to ‘The use of photography is strictly prohibited.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

That was the case on Friday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the provincial and territorial leaders to work out a national approach to pricing on carbon emissions. Before the meeting, Mr. Trudeau set out a plan where the price — either through a fossil fuel tax or a cap-and-trade system of emission allowances — would reach 50 Canadian dollars, or about $38, a metric ton, or 2,205 pounds, over five years. He also warned that provinces that did not buy in would have the price imposed on them. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would pull the United States out of the climate change commitments made by the Obama administration. Some Canadians, mostly Conservative politicians, say the economy will be in jeopardy if Canada goes ahead with carbon pricing in the absence of American action.

The city is surprisingly beautiful with flowering trees and the perfect climate: 70s and 80s, sunny, low humidity — almost every day. It’s a palpably multicultural place, encapsulating what is happening in Africa better than any other city on the continent. Picture new construction, a lot of people, intense traffic, and more and more Western businesses.

Twice a week, instead of driving to his laboratory at the Arkansas Children’s Hospital, he headed to the medical-school campus about a mile away. There, he joined some 20 students learning to pipette liquid extracts into gels and stain them with pigments to figure out which protein molecules they contained. Burks had only recently completed his medical fellowship, where he studied why some children have allergic reactions to milk and eggs. Now he was throwing himself into biochemistry so he could be the first to figure out what it was about peanuts that made people so allergic. “It’s easy to say you want to do something that’ll change kids’ lives,” Burks says. “But you have to focus on an area to really get it done.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/magazine/is-it-possible-to-make-a-less-allergenic-peanut.html

His latest effort consists of 13 short films whose scripts are stitched together from nearly 50 manifestoes mostly by 20th-century artists, composers, architects and filmmakers. From Futurism to Pop Art and beyond, the writings layer knowledge, language and style into head-spinning densities.

(It’s currently No. 14.) Abrams, who conceived and helped write the book, is taking some liberties here in the name of comedy — he actually identifies as secular despite his Jewish roots, and the participants really met not in a bar but in the Dalai Lama’s residence in Dharamsala, India, over the course of a week last year. But when the subject is joy, a little humor is allowed. “See if you can chuckle at your problem, at your shortcomings, at your frailties,” the book advises toward the end. “Even if it is a very grave or serious situation, there is often some humor that can be found. The human drama is often a comedy, and laughter is the saving grace.” (O.K., so those sentences are themselves strikingly earnest and humorless. But do as they say, not as they do.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

It is not good (even Rollin nuts rate it low), but I checked it out again to see if there was some Christmas or holiday theme I’d missed before. No dice.

He has also been a private chef for professional basketball players and racecar drivers, and said that many of them wanted tempting food like fried chicken and biscuits to be gluten-free. That’s what has inspired his new casual venture into Southern fare. “It can be healthy,” he said. The fried chicken and biscuits are available with or without gluten, as are the mac and cheese, potpies, several sandwiches and some of the desserts. He makes his own gluten-free flour, and cooks his grits in coconut milk, to accommodate dairy-free diets. The dozen or so sides are based mostly on organic vegetables, and there are also rotisserie chickens.

By analyzing patterns of reading and sharing, the company said, it might be able to penalize articles that are shared at especially low rates by those who read them — a signal of dissatisfaction. Finally, it said, it would try to put economic pressure on bad actors in three ways: by banning disputed stories from its advertising ecosystem; by making it harder to impersonate credible sites on the platform; and, crucially, by penalizing websites that are loaded with too many ads.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/magazine/facebooks-problem-isnt-fake-news-its-the-rest-of-the-internet.html

Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God.

2016-12-23,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Criminy: “Turbo Twenty-Three,” the latest entry in Janet Evanovich’s long-running series about the New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, is No. 9 in its fifth week on the hardcover fiction list. Evanovich keeps herself busy, James Patterson style: Besides the salty Plum novels, which she writes on her own, she also hit the hardcover list in 2016 with two thrillers she co-wrote — “The Pursuit,” written with Lee Goldberg as part of the Fox and O’Hare series, and “Curious Minds,” written with Phoef Sutton as the debut of the Knight and Moon series. All three share Evanovich’s boisterous humor, but one thing separating the protagonists is their vocabulary, as the website MyCentralJersey.com observed in an interview last summer: “Your newest heroine, Riley Moon, despite two professional degrees from Harvard, never swears,” the reporter Tricia Vanderhoof pointed out. (You have to love that “despite.”) “Instead she says Crikes, Holy Moly, Crikey. . . .

When it finally noticed my sister cruising through a space where humans normally are not, it pulled up, coming to a sudden halt, vertical in the water. The sea lion looked amazed and delighted — at least, that’s how it looked to me, looking at my sister — and at that moment, the thing I wanted most in the world was to learn how to hold my breath and dive deep long enough so that I might also startle and amaze someone, or something, like a sea lion.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-not-breathing.html

His music, by turns minimal and lush, incorporates an array of influences from Bach to rock to West African kora music. While sold-out audiences across Europe find something sublime in his searching style, some classical critics disagree — like Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian, who says it’s nothing more than the “dashed-off poignancy of an Instagrammed sunset.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/arts/music/ludovico-einaudi.html
2016-12-30,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Star Power: This week’s lists reflect book sales for the period ending Dec. 24, which means you’ll find lots of famous novelists on the fiction side of the ledger: In publishing as in home electronics, brand names sell well for the holidays. They know it, too. Here’s John Grisham — whose thriller “The Whistler” remains No. 1 in its ninth week on the hardcover fiction list — describing his target audience in a November interview with Slate: “First of all, she’s female, because two-thirds of all books are bought by women. She’s going to buy it during the Christmas season, because 35 percent of all books are sold during the Christmas season. I would guess she’s probably going to be over 40, because they buy more books than under 40. And that kind of narrows it down. That’s probably my typical reader.” In the same interview, Grisham said he often writes from a sense of injustice about a given subject — don’t be surprised if he tackles student debt in a future thriller — and he gave vent, just a bit, to his political views. The short version: He doesn’t think much of Donald Trump. The slightly longer, more diplomatic version: “I still pull for the underdog. I still like the little guy, especially when the little guy is getting screwed by the big guy: the government, a corporation, an issue, whatever. . . . But you’ve got to be careful with your audience, because they don’t always share my politics. You can’t be intrusive with your politics in popular fiction, when you’re trying to entertain people. I really have to watch that, and I do watch it. I don’t feel a responsibility to write a book next year that might change something.
