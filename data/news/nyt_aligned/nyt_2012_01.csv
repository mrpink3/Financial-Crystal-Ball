When you can get them with the greens attached, they’re a two-in-one crop, like beets, as their greens bring you a whole new set of nutrients – lots of calcium, vitamin K, vitamin A and beta carotene – and culinary possibilities.

In the original cartoons Tintin, the creation of the Belgian artist Hergé, spoke French, and thus his name should be pronounced “Tanh-tanh,” and not, as the movie has it, to rhyme with “win win.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/movies/tintin-is-a-new-breed-of-comic-book-hero-for-most-americans.html

2012-01-03,Ohio: Sites of Two Earthquakes Nearly Identical,"The 4.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Youngstown on Saturday occurred at an almost identical location to one a week before, a seismologist who studied the quakes said Monday. Both earthquakes occurred close to the bottom of a 9,200-foot-deep disposal well where for months, brine and other liquid waste from natural-gas wells had been injected under pressure. They were the 10th and 11th earthquakes to occur near the well since March, but the first to be precisely located. The finding provides further evidence to support what some scientists had suspected: that the waste, from the drilling process called hydraulic fracturing that is used to unlock natural gas from shale rock, might have migrated from the disposal well into deeper rock formations, allowing an ancient fault to slip. Similar links between hydraulic-fracturing disposal wells and earthquakes have been suspected in recent years in Texas and Arkansas. John Armbruster, a seismologist with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of Columbia University, said that the epicenter of the quake Saturday was about 100 meters, or 110 yards, from that a 2.7-magnitude quake on Dec. 24. There were a few reports of minor damage from the earthquake on Saturday, but none from any of the earlier quakes. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources reached an agreement last week with the owner of the disposal well, D&L Energy, to halt operations indefinitely and issued a moratorium on further development of disposal wells in the area until the analysis of the 4.0 quake was completed.

The capsule, Wu’s first in collaboration with a mass retailer, possesses a lot of the label’s familiar, feminine spirit but takes more direct inspiration from French New Wave films and the actress Jean Seberg. Pleated frocks with sailor-striped hemlines, dainty silk blouses with neck ties and collars, and sportier knits and tennis skirts stand out as some of the line’s most wearable pieces. “My goal was not to duplicate anything from my main collection,” Wu says. “Instead I designed completely new clothes and accessories that reflect my taste and have a voice of their own.” Friendly reminders of Wu’s work (like the touch of lace on a trench coat or T-shirt) are matched with a delightful dose of animal humor. (Meet Milu, a mischievous kitty and the collection’s mascot, who makes appearances as a print on a scarf and tee.) Here, a Riviera cotton striped A-line dress and canvas satchel explain why Wu calls the whole gamut “gamine chic.” It seems, as they say, les jeux sont faits.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/bulls-eye-jason-wu-for-target/

The stool’s graceful shape recalls a butterfly’s wings, and has also been compared to the form of torii, the traditional Shinto shrine gates. According to Matilda McQuaid, the deputy curatorial director at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the stool “epitomizes Yanagi’s approach to design. He loved traditional Japanese crafts and was dedicated to the modernist principles of simplicity, practicality and tactility that are associated with Alvar Aalto, Charles and Ray Eames, and Le Corbusier.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/seeing-things-sori-yanagis-everyday-beauty/

In all fairness, my childhood and adolescence were spent studying ballet. Anyone who’s worn a pair of pointe shoes will confirm that dancing in them is a kind of quiet torture that ceases to bother only after you’ve grown numb to the pain. Your feet never really recover from the trauma. I sought out Levine and a few other foot gurus after determining spring’s must-have shoes: the bejeweled slip-ons from Oscar de la Renta, the velvet clogs from Miu Miu and the heel-less metallic numbers with super-pointy toes from Louis Vuitton, among others. The problem? All of these options are of the 18th-century mule variety. In other words, they leave your heels fully exposed, and mine, still callused and battered to a point seemingly beyond return, were in no position to be naked.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/vain-glorious-the-happy-heel/

The apartment belonged to Doubleday & Company, my employer, and was used by the occasional sojourner from the New York office, though there was no Doubleday business in Paris to justify such luxury. At the age of 25 I was such a sojourner, rewarded for having created a successful new paperback format that would become the industry standard. In Paris I visited the offices of the great French publishing houses Gallimard, Plon and Hachette, and in the evening Barbara and I were treated to Krug and La Tâche at Le Grand Véfour and Chez Allard, where we chatted with our hosts about the Sartre-Camus quarrel, the emerging cold war and the calamity of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

After Heydrich’s elaborate funeral ceremony at the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Hitler screamed at the Czech president, Emil Hacha, “Nothing can prevent me from deporting millions of Czechs if they do not wish for peaceful coexistence.” It wasn’t an idle threat. “Since the violent death of Heydrich,” Mann lamented, “terror is raging everywhere, in a more sickly, unrestrained fashion than ever before. . . . An entire town, that supposedly sheltered the perpetrators, is massacred and razed.” Indeed, to honor Heydrich and help create what Hitler referred to as “Germany’s Garden of Eden” in the East, the Nazis chose the code name “Aktion Reinhard” for the extermination of two million people, most of whom were Jewish, in the General Government of Poland by the end of 1943.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/books/review/books-about-heinrich-himmler-and-reinhard-heydrich-review.html

Woodrell writes about violence and dark deeds better than almost anyone in America today, in compact, musical prose that doesn’t dwell on visceral detail. An unerring craftsman, he can fully describe a murder in one rich sentence: “The first time he killed the man, Jepperson, an opinionated foreigner from Minnesota, he kept to simple Ozark tradition and used a squirrel rifle, bullet to the heart, classic and effective, though there were spasms of the limbs and even a lunge of big old Jepperson’s body that seemed like he was about to take a step, flee, but he died in stride and collapsed against a fence post.” Every story is loaded with gems like that.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/books/review/the-outlaw-album-stories-by-daniel-woodrell-book-review.html

2012-01-06,Inside the List,"GOD OF WINE: “She could always go to Bacchus and bury her face against his big, thick neck and cry, and he would nuzzle her hair and breathe his warm, velvety breath on her neck, and she would feel comforted.” Reading that sentence from Tami Hoag’s new suspense novel, “Down the Darkest Road,” which enters the hardcover list at No. 11 this week, it’s easy to recall that Hoag got her start as a romance writer before turning to the grisly mysteries that made her famous. It’s not what you might think, though. Bacchus is a horse, not a bare-chested hunk, and the 15-year-old girl crying into his neck is about to risk her life facing down the villain who abducted her sister. (Spoiler alert: the climax involves a hoof pick as a weapon.) What’s more, Bacchus isn’t even fictional. In her nonwriting life, Hoag is a championship dressage rider — she’s set novels in the equestrian world before — and Bacchus is the horse she’s competed with since a 2006 accident broke her back and led to the death of her previous riding partner, Coco Chanel. “Schooling my horses is like meditation to me,” Hoag writes on her official Web site. “This is the one time of day my mind is not occupied by my fictional characters.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2012-01-06,The Strange Death of the Republican Moderate,"Half a century ago Republicans were a respectable but slightly boring presence on the political scene. Wary of excessive government, they were nonetheless reconciled to its expansion under Franklin D. Roosevelt and were mainly concerned with keeping it lean and solvent. Their beau idéal was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who in 1952 became the first Republican in 24 years to be elected president. His principal opponent for the nomination, Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, had opposed the New Deal and was a staunch isolationist who opposed supporting Britain in the first years of World War II. Eisenhower represented a more pragmatic strain of conservatism, internationalist when it came to foreign policy and willing to accept a larger government role at home. He called it “modern Republicanism.” With Eisenhower’s landslide re-election in 1956, his gospel looked like the future, at least for the G.O.P.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/books/review/books-about-conservatism-and-the-tea-party.html

Performed in the round, it features a 24-woman choir, a giant Tesla coil and several large custom-built instruments that Bjork and her collaborators invented: a portable pipe organ, four 10-foot pendulums that play harp notes as they swing, a gramophone-like contraption called a “Sharpsichord” and another piece called a “gameleste,” which is a fusion of a celesta and a gamelan.

2012-01-09,Illinois: Inmate Cleared by DNA Is Freed,"A man who has been convicted three times in the 1992 murder of an 11-year-old baby sitter in suburban Chicago was released from prison on Friday after a local prosecutor decided not to challenge an appellate court’s ruling that reversed the last conviction. The man, Juan Rivera, 39, had been incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in the far southwest suburbs of Chicago. The Lake County state’s attorney, Michael Waller, in a statement defended his office’s prosecution of Mr. Rivera, whose case was featured in an article in The New York Times Magazine. “I am mindful that for Mr. Rivera and some others, this decision will be viewed as too late in coming,” Mr. Waller said. Though there was no physical evidence linking Mr. Rivera to the crime, he was convicted of raping and murdering the baby sitter, Holly Staker, based largely on his confession. In 2005, DNA testing determined that Mr. Rivera was not the source of semen found inside Holly, and he was awarded a new trial, his third. Mr. Rivera was convicted again. In its reversal order last month, the appellate court suggested that Mr. Rivera’s confession was coerced. The investigation into Holly’s murder has been reopened.

2012-01-09,Exxon and Salazar in Settlement on Offshore Leases,"The Exxon Mobil Corporation and Kenneth Salazar, the interior secretary, agreed to settle a lawsuit in which Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, challenged the government’s decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield “billions of barrels of oil,” according to a court filing. The accord “will allow Exxon Mobil to develop this very large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased approach,” Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon, said in an e-mail. Exxon sued on Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia unit. The company and the government entered into a settlement agreement on Dec. 30, according to a filing Friday in United States District Court in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to suspend production in their fields, partly “to facilitate proper development of a lease.” The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating that the company“had not demonstrated a commitment to production” according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals followed. ",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/business/energy-environment/exxon-and-salazar-in-settlement-on-offshore-leases.html

2012-01-09,China: TV Limits May Hit the Web," Restrictions on the broadcasting of television historical dramas in China that went into effect on Jan. 1 may soon also extend to Web sites, according to a report released this week by Marbridge Consulting, a business analysis company. The report said that the agency regulating film and television, commonly known as Sarft, had said that as of Jan. 1, at least half of any satellite television network’s dramas must be set in the modern day. Last year, the agency expressed disapproval of time-travel shows, which often involve a modern-day protagonist’s being propelled back into a dynastic era. The Marbridge report said that of more than 50 dramas in production at Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang Province, more than 30 historical costume dramas had halted because of the new restrictions. Sarft’s clampdown on historical dramas is occurring at the same time that it is limiting reality television programs, which it considers “vulgar.” The actions are part of a much wider push to better control culture that was announced last October by Communist Party leaders.

Japan already requires utilities to conduct safety checks on reactors at 30 years, and again at 40 years, to stay in operation. Fresh legislation will set the legal lifespan of reactors at 40 years, though the government will still approve extensions on a case-by-case basis. Excluding the six damaged reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, 13 others in Japan will hit the 40-year limit in the next decade, according to the Ministry of Trade.

Hence, the plastic tortoise kitten heels, the fabrics that make references to shag carpets and couches (her only resources) and the jackets made of a leather that’s washed to look faux (she’s just not that fancy). “She’s sweet looking but not dull,” Henry said. And she has a terrific, intuitive sense of style, one that doesn’t require money. Here, because he likes “calm, strong, happy colors with metallics,” is a yellow shearling jacket and skirt look paired with the coolest metallic pumps and matching camera bag.

There was no rug, only a slice of cold linoleum glued to a concrete floor — hard as Lambeau Field, the Green Bay Packers’ tundra, on an icy afternoon. We wore elbow pads and kneepads and kept the windows wide open to minimize the chances of breaking one. When the football sailed through one after a bad throw, it was a beautiful thing to watch — the spiraling ball taking a sweet, long ride. We’d hang from the second story windowsill and slip down to the street to get the ball. It was just another play.We got away with it because Mr. and Mrs. Murphy never got home before 6. Besides, where else could we go? We had no backyards, and it was the 1960s in New York City — we were barely allowed to ride the subways by ourselves, and grass fields were scarce. But I loved the sport. I carried my football everywhere, just in case anyone wanted to play catch. I slept with it to prevent fumbling. And even more important, I loved the New York Giants. The “ny” on their helmets was tattooed on my heart. It’s no wonder that — 35 years after the team moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey — they’re still called the New York Giants.

Haley Barbour in his final days in office. State Attorney General Jim Hood argued that granting clemency for some convicts was unconstitutional because the pardons had not been sufficiently publicized beforehand. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Barbour, who left office Tuesday, issued a statement about the pardons, which have caused a storm of controversy. Of those granted clemency, 188 had already left prison, most of them years ago, it said, and the “pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote.” Of the 26 who were in custody, 13 were placed on “indefinite suspension due to medical reasons because their health care expenses while incarcerated were costing the state so much money.” The remaining number includes five inmates released on Sunday, including four men serving life sentences for murder, who had worked at the Governor’s Mansion.

On Nov. 13, 1894, in Chicago, the inventor Frederick Weeks Wilcox patented a version of what he called a “paper pail,” which was a single piece of paper, creased into segments and folded into a (more or less) leakproof container secured with a dainty wire handle on top.

2012-01-13,Let’s Start Paying College Athletes,"I certainly agree with Joe Nocera that basketball and football players are treated like chattel in the present system. Denying players a basic stipend when coaches are making ridiculous amounts is the height of inequity. But paying football and men’s basketball players isn’t feasible, given Title IX regulations and politics. If you disconnect moneymaking sports, women’s sports will very likely lose financing. Paying basketball and football players will not address the core problem of an unsustainable arms race in college sports. The proposition that the N.C.A.A. is in charge and can control college sports is a canard. If the N.C.A.A. pushes too hard, top conferences could create their own basketball playoff and challenge the N.C.A.A. tournament, which is currently a huge windfall for the N.C.A.A. Then the decentralization of power that began with the Supreme Court decision will only get worse. Your proposal offers an important contribution to the debate by arguing for stipends to players, the right to counsel and a defined scholarship term and the opportunity for lifetime health insurance. But getting there isn’t going to be easy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/magazine/reply-all-paying-college-athletes.html
2012-01-13,‘Why Write Novels at All?’,"Last year, I found myself mildly obsessed with a cache of YouTube clips, featuring the novelists Jeffrey Eugenides, Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace and Nathan Englander at a 2006 literary conference in Italy called Le Conversazioni. Part of what interested me, in a gate-crashing kind of way, was the backdrop: midsummer on the Isle of Capri, with flora aflame and a sky the color of Chablis. Another part, inevitably, was watching Wallace with the knowledge that he would kill himself two years later. Mostly what I kept coming back to, though, was how lighthearted, how loose — how young — these writers seemed here. It’s not that they weren’t already an accomplished quintet, with a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award to their credit. But in 2006 the gravitational center of Anglo-American letters still lay back on U.S. soil with Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy and John Updike and Toni Morrison and Philip Roth — those towering figures who, according to a Times survey released earlier that year, produced the greatest American fiction of the previous quarter-century.

Over many visits and phone conversations, Robbins explored Clark’s life behind bars and her slow transformation from unrepentant young radical to a reflective, deeply regretful model inmate.

In “Angel of the Battlefield,” the mother is not deceased but simply distracted, settling herself and the children in a new home and proving herself in a new job.

If so, it’s not the one we live in. Yet nothing in the sometimes pathetic struggle of Americans over, say, 50 to claim a respectable place in the public consciousness puts Cohen in the grumpy mood she could so rightly claim after absorbing some 200 years of the history of middle age. Instead, she’s delivered a lively, well-researched chronicle of the social and scientific forces that brought midlife America to its current befuddled state — better off by most measures than any previous generation, but miserably out of fashion.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/in-our-prime-the-invention-of-middle-age-by-patricia-cohen-book-review.html

2012-01-13,What Friedrich Nietzsche Did to America," In 1889, when Friedrich Nietzsche suffered the mental collapse that ended his career, he was virtually unknown. Yet by the time of his death in 1900 at the age of 55, he had become the philosophical celebrity of his age. From Russia to America, admirers echoed his estimation of himself as a titanic figure who could alter the course of history: “I am by far the most terrible human being that has existed so far; this does not preclude the possibility that I shall be the most beneficial.” His origins were humble for the role. The son of a small-town Lutheran minister, he steeped himself in classical literature while growing up in eastern Germany. When he was 24, he secured a professorship in Basel, Switzerland, and a few years later published his first book, “The Birth of Tragedy.” Against the common view of the ancient Greeks as the epitome of serene equipoise, Nietzsche emphasized the “Dionysian” excess and frenzy that complemented the “Apollonian” virtues of clarity and repose. The book’s success was limited, and its author was mocked by one leading classicist as an atavist run amok who should “gather tigers and panthers about his knees, but not the youth of Germany.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/american-nietzsche-by-jennifer-ratner-rosenhagen-book-review.html
2012-01-13,Michel Houellebecq’s Version of the American Thriller,"Michel Houellebecq’s new novel is a weird air plant of a book: it feeds off atmosphere, rather than soil. The climate of “The Map and the Territory” is very still and very strange, as if something bad had just been detonated over it. The same bad thing may also have convulsed France, where the story is set, because Houellebecq’s Paris exists in a state of flagrant social breakdown and the countryside has become an emptied theme park of itself. This “was exactly what the world would look like,” a character thinks on entering a picturesque French village that only second-home-owners can afford to buy into, “after the explosion of an intergalactic neutron bomb.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/michel-houellebecqs-version-of-the-american-thriller.html

While others of his generation may mine the tradition for a fond retrieval of forgotten lore, Auslander throws stones at the fiddler on the roof. He’s a black comic who’s alloyed the manic existential shtick of Lenny Bruce with the gallows humor that’s been a staple of the repertoire since the Babylonian Exile. In his two previous books, “Beware of God,” a collection of wickedly funny if not just plain wicked stories, and “Foreskin’s Lament,” a memoir that torched the bridges to his strict Orthodox heritage, he’s been relentlessly indicting the Hebrew God as a poor role model. In the process he’s made himself both celebrated and notorious: he is patently not good for the Jews.

But the primary evidence for this belief — “the unrelenting way the Orphan Master singled him out for punishment” — invites other interpretations. Like the rest of the boys, he is given a name from the list of the 114 Grand Martyrs of the Revolution that will mark him as an orphan for the rest of his life.

Co-produced by the directors Pedro Almodóvar and Fernando Meirelles (“City of God”), it examines the relationship of love and support that sustains José Saramago, the Portuguese novelist who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1998, and his wife, Pilar del Rio, as Saramago battled to write one last novel before his death in 2010 at the age of 87.

It’s a little weird, finding out you were every bit as out of touch as you feared.

The ministry’s order, which has been widely protested by many of the organization’s members, threatens to effectively silence Iran’s last remaining autonomous forum for free expression in the visual arts. The director, Asghar Farhadi, whose movie “A Separation” is favored to win the top honors at the Golden Globe awards on Sunday, told Ministry officials in the letter that “If the decision to dissolve the House of Cinema is based on the idea that the majority of the film community and members of the guild are in agreement with your method, then I suggest that you take a vote on this decision among the few thousand members of the House of Cinema.” An excerpt of the letter was published by the Web site of Shargh, an Iranian reformist newspaper that has often been shut down by the government. Mr. Farhadi’s film, about the breakup of a family, has shattered box-office office records in Iran and won nearly three dozen awards. The Culture Ministry’s order was supposed to take effect this week, and it remains unclear whether House of Cinema’s management committee will seek a way to nullify it. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/world/middleeast/iran-acclaimed-director-protest-shutdown-of-cinema-guild.html

That same story suggests, intriguingly, that perception, understanding and imagination, which we might intuitively consider to be three distinct chunks of our mental machinery, are inextricably tied together as simultaneous results of a single underlying strategy known as “predictive coding.” This strategy saves on bandwidth using (who would have guessed it?) one of the many technical wheezes that enable us to economically store and transmit pictures, sounds and videos using formats such as JPEG and MP3.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/do-thrifty-brains-make-better-minds/

It was criticized ahead of its premiere by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the Human Rights Campaign, which said in a joint statement that “by encouraging the audience to laugh at the characters’ attempts at womanhood, the show gives license to similar treatment of transgender women.” The show was poorly received by viewers in early January. Days before the schedule change was made public, Paul Lee, the president of ABC Entertainment, defended the show to TV reporters by saying, “We thought there was room for a very, very, very silly show.” ABC has not said what show will succeed “Work It” in the time slot on Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., but it may go to the returning sitcom “Cougar Town,” which has yet to be assigned a spot this season.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/arts/television/abc-kills-work-it.html

All of these operations and many more require a valid internal passport, a peculiar document that may be the most significant vestige of the U.S.S.R. in modern Russian society.Back when we lived behind the Iron Curtain, these passports entitled us to travel only within the confines of the Soviet Union. Anyone lucky enough to be allowed to travel abroad was issued a special foreign-travel passport just for the occasion and had to surrender it upon returning home. When Russians acquired the right to travel freely, they got to keep their foreign-travel passports. But the internal passport refused to die. So now each adult Russian citizen has two passports.

NBC said on Monday that its live Globes telecast on Sunday night drew 16.8 million viewers, down a whisker from last year’s 17 million. About 4 percent fewer people in the target demographic, adults age 18 to 49, tuned in, as measured by raw ratings points. (A 5.0 this year compared to a 5.2 last year.) NBC had heavily promoted Mr. Gervais’s acerbic comedic style as a reason to watch. As promised, he delivered a crude monologue – a repeat performance of 2011, when his remarks drew gasps – but shocking people twice with the same shtick is hard to pull off. Other factors possibly affecting interest in the show: NBC has limited ability to promote itself (the network’s overall schedule remains in the ratings basement), and the Globes also celebrated a batch of smaller films like “The Artist” that have produced limited box-office results. Still, the telecast was a win for NBC, delivering the network’s biggest audience, excluding sporting events, since last year’s Globes.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/slightly-fewer-viewers-for-this-years-golden-globes/

American tourists and businesspeople gravitate toward other German cities: Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt. And so Hamburg, bigger than all but Berlin, remains a bit of a mystery, poised to become a thrilling discovery. Did you know about the lake? It’s smack dab in the city center and skirted by regal buildings, a postcard-ready tableau if there ever was one. And the canals? They lattice the part of the city nearest the Elbe River, allowing Hamburg to joust with Stockholm, Amsterdam and Bruges for informal rights to call itself the Venice of northern Europe. Hamburg in winter is cold and often gray. No getting around that. But the indoors migration of many Hamburg residents gives the city a quiet and peace that I relished on a recent visit. Sure, the blustery weather persuaded me to skip the lake ferries and Elbe cruises recommended in summertime.

She had chances to win the first set, but Kuznetsova prevailed, 8-6, in the tiebreaker. The set took 69 minutes and Stephens came away with nothing. It is perhaps the harshest aspect of the tennis scoring system: sets and games — no matter how close — are winner take all. Other sports (football and basketball come to mind) stop at halftime and each team still has a chance to win. In other words, the losing team’s points are not erased.",Sports,https://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/stephenss-talent-promise-evident-in-loss/

Because if memory serves me, just a few years ago conservatives were denouncing the “flypaper theory” of tax incidence, arguing that much of the burden of corporate taxes really falls on labor, not on stockholders.

Burke’s sport, freestyle skiing, is one of a long line of sports growing more perilous as the athletes get better and  the physics get riskier as speeds and heights increase. Sure, we cheer as we see skiers and snowboarders flip in the air, gasp as race cars pass inches from one another at top speeds, howl as hockey players and football players pound each other, our knowledge of the dangers safely stashed away.

2012-01-20,Up Front,"Charles Isherwood, who reviews Ian Donaldson’s biography of Ben Jonson on the cover, has been a theater critic at The New York Times since 2004. “When I grew up theater was what the adults did, mostly,” Isherwood wrote in an e-mail. “But I evinced an early sensitivity to the form. One of my first memories is of being taken to see a stage version of ‘The Wizard of Oz.’ I was so traumatized by the appearance of the Wicked Witch of the West that I had to be taken home in hysterics at the intermission. Not the last time I’ve gotten weepy at the theater.” Isherwood went to Stanford, where he was “a generic English major”: “My mother bemoaned this fact, and remains pleasantly surprised that I am still employed today. I took classes in Shakespeare and Restoration comedy and Japanese theater, but never formally studied theater. For me college was basically an excuse to sit around reading Henry James novels, when I wasn’t racing off to San Francisco in my secondhand Chevy Vega to see bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Gang of Four and dance all night at clubs. Had I known the path my career would take, I would have spent a lot more time on Molière and Stanislavsky.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/up-front.html

As we were guided into pigeon pose, the teacher offered this: “The thing is,” she told us, “if you’re mindful, you won’t get hurt.” I went home and read the article. I had not so much a crisis of confidence, but a feeling that “if you’re mindful, you won’t get hurt” was very possibly an inadequate answer.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/magazine/reply-all-yoga-injuries.html

2012-01-20,Inside the List,"FEMALE POWER: Jayne Ann Krentz’s latest paranormal romance, “Copper Beach,” is new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. Krentz is no stranger to this page — she’s had more than 30 New York Times best sellers — and with her success she has become a vocal defender of the romance category as a whole. In interviews, she talks about the genre’s link to the “heroic tradition,” and as far back as 1992 she edited a cultural studies anthology, “Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women,” in which she argued that romances were by nature both feminist and subversive: “Readers understand that the books celebrate female power. In the romance novel . . . the woman always wins. With courage, intelligence and gentleness she brings the most dangerous creature on earth, the human male, to his knees.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2012-01-20,Georges Remi: Learning His Lines,"Cartoonists are a peculiar breed of artist. For one thing, they’re hesitant about the use of the A-word. Their craft — now that’s better — also comes with great constraints. Because the work appears in newspapers and comic books, it must strike a commercial chord quickly: there isn’t much time for it to “find an audience.” The field doesn’t boast many lonely geniuses whose work is discovered posthumously. The demands of reproduction put limits on complexity, and the panel format — those squares and rectangles — erects graphic walls. For successful cartoonists, producing every day on someone else’s schedule, the grind is relentless. Cartoonists tend not to be boulevardiers; their way of life is sedentary and often solitary, and their days are spent in the company of invented characters in an invented world. Life and work can merge in curious ways. I happen to be the son of a cartoonist — a happy and well-adjusted cartoonist — and collaborated with him on “Prince Valiant,” but it was clear to all of us in the family that our situation was not quite normal. Or, thinking back to the moment when an electrician came into my father’s studio and found him posing — on his back, wearing a wig and a skirt, holding a garbage can lid as a shield and using a plunger on a rubber tube to snap a Polaroid — it may just have been that we had a different sense of what “normal” was.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/herge-son-of-tintin-by-benoit-peeters-translated-by-tina-a-kover-book-review.html

Well brought-up women like herself were to be cultured, pious, submissive and genteel. Fuller, by contrast, was assertive and freethinking.

2012-01-20,The Shadow of Nuremberg,"On the campaign trail in June 2008, Barack Obama commented on the Supreme Court’s extension of the constitutional right of habeas corpus to detainees held at the naval facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. “During the Nuremberg trials, part of what made us different was even after these Nazis had performed atrocities that no one had ever seen before, we still gave them a day in court, and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law,” Obama said. “Now the Supreme Court upheld that principle yesterday,” he added. Obama’s statement linked Nuremberg to an idea central to his presidential campaign: The Bush administration in the fight against Islamist terrorists had compromised American values and undermined America’s wartime rule-of-law legacy. The Supreme Court had begun the task of restoring those values, Obama suggested, and he promised to finish the job as president.

2012-01-20,When Children’s Speech Turns Lethal,"In a career spanning nearly 20 years, Ben Marcus has written just four spare volumes: a story collection, two novels and a chapbook. Formally inventive, dark and dryly comic, this work has earned him critical praise and a small army of devoted fans. His prose is heavily metaphorical yet coolly ironic; it traffics in the language of scholarship, myth and history, and until now has forsaken the conventional trappings of narrative. Indeed, the pieces in “The Age of Wire and String” (1995) function more like prose poems than stories; their emotional impact is derived from their distinctive diction and syntax. The opener, “Argument,” might serve as a map of Marcus’s early career, with its stated goal of “cataloging a culture” through “an array of documents settling within the chief concerns of the society, of any society, of the world and its internal areas.” The book’s archness is both bracing and absurd; it attempts to reinvent story by repurposing, gleefully, the jargon ordinarily used to analyze it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/the-flame-alphabet-by-ben-marcus-book-review.html

It also includes the standalone special “X-Men: Regenesis,” written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Billy Tan, in which the other X-Men choose whether they will stand with Cyclops or Wolverine. The X-Men are synonymous with change, with the characters getting reshuffled into new teams every few years, so the fracture among the heroes may be temporary.

This black-and-white, largely silent film, starring Jean Dujardin, above, with Uggie, picked up the top prize, best feature, from the Producers Guild of America, which announced its winners on Saturday night in Los Angeles. The guild has followed the lead of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in nominating 10 films for best picture in the last two years. It has also accurately predicted the eventual best-picture Oscar winner, even in the expanded field. When it chose “The Hurt Locker” over the much higher-grossing “Avatar” in 2010, awards watchers considered it a bellwether prize. (Though the Academy may nominate anywhere from 5 to 10 films this year, the Producers Guild stuck with 10.) Steven Spielberg’s “Adventures of Tintin” won best animated film, and “Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest” earned the documentary feature prize. ABC’s hit “Modern Family” took home the first award of the night, for best TV comedy, and “Downton Abbey” (PBS) won for best long-form show. “Boardwalk Empire” (HBO) picked up best drama, beating “Mad Men” (AMC). “The Amazing Race” (CBS) won for television competition, and “The Colbert Report” (Comedy Central) won for talk show.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/movies/awardsseason/the-artist-wins-producers-guild-prize.html

A quarter of the Ring material did not sell, especially images of veiled mourners and gravestones sewn in memory of deceased relatives.

At the time, Los Angeles was lacking a juicery that used a hydraulic press, a machine that squelches an entire fruit or vegetable into a pulp, extracting three to four times more than an average juicer. After yoga class one day, Slater found the perfect spot for one: a 22-square-foot broom closet adjacent to the Brentwood Country Mart. Today, Pressed is a thriving business — a second location (in a truck) opened in Malibu last summer, and at the end of last year Slater and friends brought a storefront to West Hollywood. The juicery also takes orders online and delivers nationwide to loyals who can’t live without its Greens 2 (a blend of kale, spinach, romaine, parsley, cucumber, celery, apple and lemon), Detox 2 (pineapple, green apple and mint) and Almond Milk (almonds, dates, vanilla bean, sea salt and filtered water).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/drink-up-pressed-juicerys-chalkboard-goes-live/

The measure, proposed by Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, has wide support in the House and had been just a few votes short in the Senate. After several undecided senators announced their support in recent weeks, Senator Mary Margaret Haugen, a Democrat, said she also would vote for the bill, becoming the decisive vote. A vote has not yet been scheduled. If the measure passes, opponents are expected to challenge it through a ballot referendum this fall. “For me personally, I have always believed in traditional marriage between a man and a woman,” Ms. Haugen said in a statement. “That is what I believe, to this day. But this issue isn’t about just what I believe. It’s about respecting others, including people who may believe differently than I. It’s about whether everyone has the same opportunities for love and companionship and family and security that I have enjoyed.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/us/washington-gay-marriage-wins-a-crucial-backer.html

The Web site is laced with anti-Semitic material and postings supporting organizations that are widely deemed to be terrorist groups, including the Afghan Taliban. A recent recruitment appeal by Forsane Alizza called for “soldiers,” and the group acknowledges some violent aims, in particular in the defense of Muslim women. The group gained attention last year through demonstrations against a French law banning the wearing of the full facial veil in public.

Though Champagne and cigarettes abounded, this was no chic Rive Gauche affair; more like the Williamsburg-on-the-Seine scene of Rue Oberkampf or, as our in-the-know illustrator Richard Haines said: “So Bushwick L train/Morgan stop.” So true. It was an über-groovy crowd — hard to discern the models from the viewers — and a perfect welcome to the final leg of the European fashion show season. What’s more, it heralded the arrival of this new French sportswear brand, following the model of A.P.C., with its cult following and affordable prices. Quirky outfits like short leather bombers and trim tweed coats layered over colored sweaters and clashing untucked shirts (with the odd floral or plaid here and there) felt more like great personal style statements than forced fashion. A bright-eyed bearded fellow wore a tee with a floralized bearded fellow on it, along with a harvest-colored houndstooth vest, matching carrot-cut pants (imagine a slightly dropped crotch with full legs that narrow at the cuff) and a tonal, double-breasted plaid coat; an amusing outfit with Parisian charm that had me at “Bon soir.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/paris-top-5-ami/

Michael J. Kelly, who had been the chief executive since 2009, will become a special adviser to the company and an adviser to Bain Capital, the private equity firm that co-owns the company with the Blackstone Group and Comcast’s NBCUniversal.The surprise change signaled a desire on the part of the co-owners to expand the Weather Channel’s digital and mobile businesses more quickly. Through mobile apps and Web sites like Weather.com, the company sees an opportunity to have a much bigger international footprint.“Six and a half billion people need information about weather,” Mr. Kenny said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the company’s staff in Atlanta.Mr. Kenny also said that the company would make more investments in long-form programming — part of a gradual move away from live weather news and toward taped weather-related reality shows.“Now that people can get the information they need for their forecast off the Web, and certainly on their mobile phone, that gives us more license to do more long-form on the cable channel,” he said. The channel remained committed to live news during severe weather, he added.Mr. Kenny, a member of the board of directors of Yahoo, was the president of Akamai until he stepped down last October. He was previously the co-founder of VivaKi, a digital agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe.In a statement, the three co-owners of the Weather Channel said that Mr. Kenny’s experience “gives him a deep understanding of the TV and digital business, and he has the leadership experience and vision to drive global initiatives across all platforms.”Mr. Kelly, similarly, had a digital media background when he was hired two and a half years ago.Mr. Kenny said he was initially recruited to join the board of the company, and was later asked by the board to consider the chief executive position.“What I’ve long stood for is convergence,” he said. “I think you’ll see us find better ways to run the Weather Channel as one company, really organized around our hundreds of millions of users.”NBCUniversal and the private equity firms have owned the Weather Channel since 2008.",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/david-kenny-named-chief-of-the-weather-channel/

2012-01-25,Reviewing the Shanty,"The Shanty, a new bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that I reviewed this week, serves a whiskey cocktail they call the Lonesome Hero. It’s a terrific drink: an old-fashioned variant made with cherry liqueur and the Czech herbal bitters Becherovka. Yet ordering one feels a little bit like getting the salmon at Peter Luger. That’s because the Shanty – for the moment, at least – is mostly about the gin. The bar is an annex of the New York Distilling Company, which has been producing two types of gin since November. They’re not the only people to do the micro-distilling thing in the borough (there’s also the Kings County Distillery and Breuckelen Distilling in Sunset Park), but they’re the first with their own bar. The Shanty is clearly more than a gin joint, and no one will push you to order the company’s products. But after admiring their gorgeous German-made pot still through a window onto the distillery floor, it’s hard to choose something made elsewhere. This week, they have started distilling the rye that will be ready for bottling a year from now. They already have a great drink to use it in.",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-shanty/

Mr. Rushdie’s plans to attend the festival, above, stirred controversy before it opened, and he said on the first day that he would not attend, citing a risk to his safety. Mr. Rushdie’s “Satanic Verses” was banned in India in 1988, and he has been the target of criticism and a fatwa from Muslim groups. His life was threatened several times before the festival, officials told the organizers. Mr. Rushdie criticized both the Indian government and Islamic leaders in an interview on Tuesday evening with the television channel NDTV.

2012-01-26,Out of Perfume? Rosewood Hotels Enlist Fragrance Butlers,"Hotels today are in the thick of a trend that caters to their guests’ seemingly smallest needs, by doing things like providing custom playlists for their iPods and giving them eight choices of pillows for their beds. Now, the luxury brand Rosewood has a new amenity to add to the list: perfumes that are specific to each property. This month, eight Rosewood properties began supplying guests with a fragrance butler, who is trained in the merits of the different scents being offered.Within five minutes of receiving a call to the concierge to request the service, a fragrance butler arrives at a room, carrying a silver tray of perfumes and colognes. Guests spritz themselves with a scent from the fragrance menu, which is tailored to each hotel.  (The Carlyle, for example, has an elegant, old-world feel, and the choices include Chanel Chance and Hermès Eau des Merveilles for women and Ralph Lauren Polo Black for men.) There is no limit to the number of times that the fragrance butler can be summoned.",Travel,https://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/out-of-perfume-rosewood-hotels-enlist-fragrance-butlers/

Since the 1970s, when Mr. Jarrett first earned a reputation for sustained, spontaneous rhapsody, he has trained his concertgoers to gather as congregants, complicit witnesses to his search for illumination. Also: no cameras. No coughing. No, seriously. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/arts/music/keith-jarrett-in-a-solo-concert-at-carnegie-hall.html

(He claimed he was working for the U.S. government to hunt terrorists, but in fact he seems to have been kidnapping his “suspects” almost randomly off the street, and choosing them partly by beard length.)

Its people reveled in their republican freedom, yet bowed undemurringly to the collective good.

Coetzee, the two most acclaimed South African novelists of the past 20 years, could be writing about different countries — and, in a way, they are. Coetzee excels at sparsely populated fictions of gnawing interiority. His socially uneasy and anguished solitaries, often academics like himself, wrestle with psychological dilemmas and metaphysical maladies. In contrast, Mda’s greatest gift is his Dickensian social range, his ability to generate characters from diverse backgrounds, colluding and colliding across the barriers erected to divide them.

She’s also beguiling to the opposite sex, one of whom regards her charm as “will-o’-the-wisp and indefinable, all strands and tendrils and impossible to pin down.” Yet Stella is unhappy, trapped in a loveless marriage, pining for her children, all of whom have left home. Getting ready for yet another dinner party, she thinks of herself as “a priestess in an Attic temple preparing for sacrifice.” This unsettling combination of magnificence and pathos suffuses Fran­cesca Kay’s second novel, “The Translation of the Bones.” (Her first, “An Equal Stillness,” won Britain’s Orange Award for New Writers.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/books/review/the-translation-of-the-bones-by-francesca-kay-book-review.html
2012-01-27,Connecting the Lowly and Mighty in New York,"Any beginning writer could find both instruction and inspiration in Elliot Perlman’s new novel, “The Street Sweeper.” If it were tricked out with commentary in the margins — in fact, now that I’ve finished marking it up, anyone’s welcome to take my copy — it could serve as a textbook on how not to write fiction. At the same time, it gives the lie to those killjoy teachers who tell you that no reputable publisher will touch your work if you don’t learn your craft. This 600-plus-page epic turns out to have only a novella’s worth of story and substance: the rest is repetition, over and over, of basic information about who the characters are, where they are and what’s going on, long expository and hortatory speeches that no real person would ever deliver and the padded, ping-ponging dialogue beloved of amateur writers. “ ‘And your family?’ ‘My family?’ ” “ ‘I’ve always felt kind of . . . fraudulent.’ ‘Fraudulent?’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/books/review/the-street-sweeper-by-elliot-perlman-book-review.html

With devastating drought and farmer suicides growing at an alarming rate in her voter base, disgruntled farmers from the dalit, or untouchable, caste have begun to voice their discontent. Ms. Laul speculates that this might mean that the B.S.P. will not sweep Uttar Pradesh with the sizable majority it achieved in 2007, leading to instability in the state and a possible harbinger to an era of coalition politics.",World,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/newswallah-long-reads-edition-17/

2012-01-30,New Contract for Philharmonic,"The New York Philharmonic’s management and musicians have agreed on a new contract, the players’ union said late Saturday. Union officials said orchestra members had been prepared to strike, jeopardizing a European tour starting Monday, without an agreement this weekend. In a statement the musicians reported reaching a two-year deal — relatively short by industry standards — in which, they said, management had dropped proposals for “drastic cuts to health insurance and a radical reduction in pension benefits.” The Philharmonic confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the defined-benefit pension plan would remain, and that pension benefits would be capped at $70,000 a year per player. The orchestra also said that both sides agreed to hire a consultant to study “the advisability of moving to a defined-contribution pension plan.” Tino Gagliardi, president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents Philharmonic players, said management backed down from eliminating defined-benefit pensions and replacing them with defined contributions. The Philadelphia Orchestra, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, recently made the change. In light of that, Mr. Gagliardi said, “it was really, really important” to take a stand. But the matter was essentially put off for two years. Mr. Gagliardi said the pension issue would be studied by both sides and revisited for the next contract. On health insurance, he said, the agreement gives “small economic relief to the employer.” The pact, he added, calls for no wage increase this year and a 2 percent raise next year.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/arts/music/new-contract-for-philharmonic.html

The 1920s teams are not included because of severe differences in the game and the league. In this installment, we rank the running back tandems, whether they are rotations, committees, or old-fashioned three-back attacks. For the teams of yesteryear, “tailbacks” who acted as de facto quarterbacks are counted in the mix.6. 1934 Giants: Harry Newman had a short, modestly distinguished career as a 179-pound A-formation tailback (by today’s standards, a Tebow). He led the league in nearly every passing category in 1933, but in 1934 he threw just one touchdown and 12 interceptions, statistics that were almost as bad then as they are today. Ken Strong was an All-Pro fullback/defensive back for both the Giants and the Staten Island Stapletons, then an N.F.L. team, and Strong rushed for 431 yards and 6 touchdowns. His best years were behind him by 1934, though he stayed with the Giants as a placekicker until after World War II. The third member of the backfield was Wee Willie Smith, who played just one season in the N.F.L. (He is not to be confused with the legendary basketball player of the same name.) You do not have to be an expert in 1930s football to realize that a backfield with one player who played just one season and another who played just three seasons belongs low on any all-time list.",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/the-giants-history-countdown-running-back-tandems/
