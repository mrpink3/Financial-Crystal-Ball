One of the most interesting was their cold-cut coasters, made by wrapping materials such as fishnet and rope around a central wooden rod or “bone” and then slicing it, like a maki roll. The resulting multicolored disks really do look almost edible. The coasters were the inspiration for a set of four circular rugs the duo created for the luxury custom carpet company Tai Ping, which was unveiled last month at Design Miami. Using a technique the designers came up with to combine multiple fibers, the carpets were fabricated in wool, cotton, chenille, bamboo, PVC, silk and more, giving the appearance of a cross section of a living organism beneath your feet.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/t-magazine/chen-chen-and-kai-williams-cleverly-made-carpets.html

And he comes in peace, man, despite causing havoc while he tries to phone home. Simon Pegg, above with Paul, and Nick Frost are the best friends, fresh from a Comic-Con convention in San Diego, who run into Paul as they guide their recreational vehicle toward Area 51, the military base in Nevada where the conspiracy minded think the government stashes aliens.

In order to get to the tanks, he had to open a metal hatch on the deck. And the hatch was covered by two 35-gallon Coleman coolers, giant plastic insulated ice chests that he and Sosinski filled before leaving the dock in Montauk harbor seven hours earlier. The coolers, full, weighed about 200 pounds, and the only way for Aldridge to move them alone was to snag a box hook onto the plastic handle of the bottom one, brace his legs, lean back and pull with all his might.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/magazine/a-speck-in-the-sea.html

2014-01-02,Diving Into the Wreck,"Watching a talented writer take a risk is one of the pleasures of devoted reading, and “On Such a Full Sea” provides all that and more. It’s a wonderful addition not only to Chang-rae Lee’s body of work but to the ranks of “serious” writers venturing into the realm of dystopian fantasy. Colson Whitehead, Cormac McCarthy and Margaret Atwood (in her recently concluded MaddAddam trilogy) have all tackled this genre. Doris Lessing’s “Mara and Dann” is a classic, as is Anthony Burgess’s “Clockwork Orange.” Further back in time, one has only to think of Orwell, Huxley and Wells, even Jack London and Mary Shelley. As the author of such carefully realist fiction as “Native Speaker” and “A Gesture Life,” Lee has always been preoccupied by the themes of hope and betrayal, by the tensions that arise in small lives in the midst of great social change. His marvelous new book, which imagines a future after the breakdown of our own society, takes on those concerns with his customary mastery of quiet detail — and a touch of the fantastic.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/books/review/on-such-a-full-sea-by-chang-rae-lee.html

In this Russian Jewish family — the Shteyngarts moved from Leningrad to Queens in 1979, when Gary was 7 — barbed jokes, or shutki, are tokens of love: weird, hostile tokens, but tokens nonetheless. The shutki continue to fly in Shteyngart’s direction even after — or maybe especially after — he becomes a successful novelist (“The Russian Debutante’s Handbook,” “Absurdistan,” “Super Sad True Love Story”). Treating his parents to dinner at the revolving restaurant atop the Marriott Marquis to celebrate his mother’s birthday, Shteyngart is a sitting duck as his father fires off this one: “I read on the Russian Internet that you and your novels will soon be forgotten.” While that may not sound exactly like a joke, it’s riotous compared with what he tells his son at another dinner: “I burn with a black envy toward you.

On Dec. 20, the nation’s Parliament passed a strict antigay bill, which mandates life in jail for engaging in “aggravated homosexuality,” as well prohibiting any form of same-sex contact. Though it has yet to be signed into law by the country’s president, it also carries harsh penalties for anyone promoting or even discussing gay material like that covered by the film, and demands that Ugandans inform on gay people or risk jail themselves.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/ugandas-antigay-bill-vs-a-documentary-on-homophobia/

As Nicholas Griffin demonstrates, in a book filled with well-chosen examples, the Chinese team visiting Colonial Williamsburg in 1972 was comfortable eating apple pie and singing “Home on the Range.” But “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” was dicier: the line “life is but a dream” was politically incompatible with the teachings of Chairman Mao.

2014-01-03,What’s On Friday,"10:15 P.M. (TCM) A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) Russell Crowe, above, in a role for which he received an Oscar nomination, portrays John Forbes Nash Jr., the gifted mathematician who battled schizophrenia for decades before going on to win the Nobel in economic science. Jennifer Connelly won for best supporting actress as Alicia Larde, the M.I.T. student who became Nash’s wife. And Ed Harris plays Nash’s contact for a government project. The paradox of this film (which won for best picture), directed by Ron Howard from a script by Akiva Goldsman, and the emotions it elicits is that the story “is almost entirely counterfeit,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, “Mr. Crowe, with his superhuman powers of concentration, shows us a man who dwells almost entirely in an inner world, and he dramatizes that inwardness as if nobody were watching.” In the end, Mr. Scott added, “the governing dynamic of ‘A Beautiful Mind’ is sentimentality of a familiar and not altogether unwelcome kind.

But the new Disney film “Saving Mr. Banks,” written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, shares two less cheerful tales. In flashback, it reveals the “Mary Poppins” author P. L. Travers’s sad past as an Australian girl with a hard-drinking father and a suicidal mother. The other story is of two weeks in 1961 when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who had been trying to secure the film rights from Ms. Travers (Emma Thompson) for nearly 20 years, finally lured her to California, where Disney staff composers, the Sherman Brothers (Jason Schwartzman and B.

2014-01-03,Back to the Future in Algeria,"The legacy of Oscar Niemeyer, the Brazilian architect who died in 2012 at the age of 104, is most familiarly seen in the Modernist buildings he designed for Brasilia, the planned city that became the country’s capital in 1960. But his work in Algeria — not nearly so well known — has also enhanced his reputation as one of the 20th century’s great architects. Niemeyer, a Communist who fled to France following the military takeover of Brazil in 1964, designed several buildings in Algeria in the late 1960s (as well as a library in recent years that is still being built). The plan for one, La Coupole, a sports arena in Algiers, which can be seen in the slide show here, was made on a napkin. Mekki Damerdji, an architect and professor in Algiers, says Mentouri University (shown here), in the city of Constantine, is a favorite of his for its stark contrast to the more traditional buildings that dominate the country’s landscape. “We’re not used to seeing this shape in our country,” Damerdji says. “We haven’t anything like this in Algeria.

2014-01-06,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) ADMISSION (2013) Tina Fey (above, seated) portrays Portia Nathan, a Princeton admissions officer who seems to take a special kind of glee in controlling the fate of applicants aspiring to the university’s ivy-covered halls. She also has a goal of her own: to succeed the retiring dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn) and beat out her office rival (Gloria Reuben) while reclaiming Princeton’s place at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. But just as her smug English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) dumps her for an aggressive Virginia Woolf scholar (Sonya Walger), a fellow Dartmouth alum (Paul Rudd) comes along with an unusual student (Nat Wolff) he wants Portia to consider. “How could anyone make light of the brutal, capricious system by which our young people are judged and sorted?” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this comedy from Paul Weitz, adapted from the novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. “And I must confess that I don’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed that ‘Admission,’ which had the potential to be a sharp, satirical jab at the soft belly of middle-class anxiety, chose instead to be a warm and wacky fable of wish fulfillment. Mr. Weitz lines up a target placed at the explosive intersection of class, race, region and every other source of societal anguish, and then does not so much miss as aim in another direction — or several — letting fly a volley of darts that land as lightly as badminton birdies.” Still, Ms. Fey and Mr. Rudd “are fun to watch, though not as much fun as they might have been in a riskier, crazier movie,” he said, adding that “the best scenes belong to Lily Tomlin, brilliantly cast as Portia’s mother, an unbowed second-wave woman warrior with a pair of borzois and a Bella Abzug tattoo.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Steiner doled out sucrose to 175 infants before they’d had a drop of mother’s milk and saw clear signs of satisfaction: The babies showed “a marked relaxation of the facial muscle,” he wrote, and “a retraction of the mouth’s angles resembling a ‘smile.’ ” Then he tried the same experiment on several babies born without a cerebral cortex and found the same result. The joy of sugar needs no cogitation; it scarcely needs a brain.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/do-animals-have-a-sweet-tooth/

Society leaders have condemned unsparingly, bishops have shuddered, royalty has expressed uncompromising disapproval, and the tango is still danced with fervor by tens of thousands. It cannot be denied that the tango in its original form would have shocked the most Bohemian society. The very name — tango, “I touch”— has a significance which needs no comment. But it is a far cry from the original as it was danced in the most undesirable cafés of the Argentine to the severely Bowdlerized version tolerated in the modern ballroom.

2014-01-06,What’s on Sunday,"9 P.M. (13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY A fourth round of the writer Julian Fellowes’s sudsy British hit about aristocrats and their servants begins as Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) mourns the death of her husband, Matthew, who was killed on the day of the birth of their baby, George, at the end of last season. But Mary finds motherhood to be scant solace, and Matthew’s death has left the estate’s financial future shaky, since he apparently did not leave a will. Meanwhile, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) appears to have at long last found love with the editor Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards); Lady Rose (Lily James), the niece of the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), stirs things up with her newfound fondness for jazz and her particular appreciation for the singer Jack Ross (Gary Carr); and Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) struggles with her place in the family, now that her son Matthew is no longer in the picture.

Offering decadent visions of alternate realities and mystic rituals, the films became a favorite with audiences of that era, as well as with generations of (often stoned) college students ever since. The 84-year-old director, who lives in Paris, recently returned to his hometown of Tocopilla, Chile, to make “The Dance of Reality,” an autobiographical film that also manages to be a hypnotic surrealist fantasia.

2014-01-09,Fire From Latest Derailment Rages in Canada," Accident investigators were unable to approach a train near the border of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick on Wednesday, more than 24 hours after five tank cars containing crude oil and four cars filled with propane derailed and burst into flames. The accident came about five months after a runaway train carrying crude oil derailed and destroyed the downtown of Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, killing 47 people.

2014-01-10,The Mind’s Jailer,"“I’ve always responded to the history of my times,” says the beleaguered narrator of “Andrew’s Brain,” almost ruefully, as if he wished it weren’t so. He has no choice, though: Responding to the history of one’s times is the sworn duty of a character in a novel by E. L. Doctorow, who has in his half-century of writing fiction placed a remarkable number of people, both real and imagined, in their history just to watch them respond. At first Andrew, whose time is the bewilderingly eventful opening decade of this century, doesn’t sound like much of a witness: A self-­described “freakishly depressive cognitive scientist klutz,” he seems far more interested in the workings of his own mind than those of the world outside, and for a long time speaks — to someone he calls Doc — only of his messy private life and his largely fruitless research into the mysteries of the human brain. He cracks cynical jokes, tells parts of his life story in the third person, indulges in a fair bit of glib self-analysis (“I am finally, terribly, unfeeling”) and generally plays the fool. “Andrew’s Brain” is cunning. It isn’t hard to figure out that Andrew is an unreliable narrator, but by the end of this sly book Doctorow has you wondering if there’s any other kind.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/books/review/andrews-brain-by-e-l-doctorow.html

2014-01-10,Beyond Beefcake in the Work of a Gay Pioneer,"In 1951, Bob Mizer began Physique Pictorial, a magazine loaded with photographs of muscular young men wearing little more than posing straps — G-strings for men. Its imagery ostensibly illustrated health and fitness, but was really aimed at what was then an underground gay market. Mizer (1922-92) was a pioneer in making explicit the genre’s erotic appeal, enough so to attract attention from legal authorities. In 1947, he was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor by taking nude pictures of a 17-year-old, and he spent a year in prison. In 1954, he was convicted of distributing obscene material through the mail. (That conviction was reversed on appeal a couple of years later.) Those speed bumps didn’t stop Mizer’s enterprise as a commercial photographer and publisher from growing to the point at which it occupied four lots near downtown Los Angeles, like a Hollywood movie studio, earning him the nickname “the Hugh Hefner of gay publishing.” Mizer, evidently, was blessedly free of high-art pretension, but Physique Pictorial was nevertheless an inspiration for artists like David Hockney and Robert Mapplethorpe.

I opened the envelope and realized it was intended for my neighbor, a woman I have known, along with her husband, for many years. The letter chronicled the dates and locations of an affair the sender claimed his wife was having with my neighbor’s husband. I regret reading the letter. Upon looking more closely at the envelope, I was able to discern my neighbor’s name (the wife) and the words “private and confidential,” but these were obscured by the postmark. It seems the sender intentionally sent the letter to my home to keep the husband from intercepting it, counting on me to deliver it to the wife. Now that the envelope is open, the neighbors will know that I have read the allegations. What is my obligation: To deliver the letter or to inform the sender that this plan didn’t go as intended?

2014-01-10,We Didn’t Eat the Marshmallow. The Marshmallow Ate Us.,"In a series of famous experiments in the 1960s and ’70s conducted by the Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel, preschoolers were invited to sit alone in a room furnished only with a small desk. On the desk sat two marshmallows (or equivalently tempting treats) and a bell. The researcher told each child that he had to leave, but that when he returned, she could eat both marshmallows. If she wanted one marshmallow before then, however, she could ring the bell and eat one, but not both. Then the researcher shut the door, leaving the child alone with the forbidden marshmallows.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/magazine/we-didnt-eat-the-marshmallow-the-marshmallow-ate-us.html

Her 25-year-old daughter Carrie, also a singer and the youngest of three children that Cash had with her ex-husband, the singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell, was also staying there for a while. It was a full house, and Cash seemed to like it that way. Carrie appeared from a downstairs bedroom to ask Cash to help her find the “save the date” cards she wanted to get in the mail for her May wedding to Dan Knobler, a guitarist and producer. Mother and daughter moved around a partly finished jigsaw puzzle on a nearby table, and Cash began looking through a cabinet, pausing to answer a phone call from a close friend, the former New Yorker TV critic Nancy Franklin. Soon the cards were found, and Carrie was off to address them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/magazine/rosanne-cash-goes-home.html

2014-01-10,The Music Gene,"Is it premature to talk of the “Powers Problem”? For the last three decades, Richard Powers has been bringing out hefty novels at the rate of one every 2.5 years: 11 in all. At his current age of 56, he is, as a novelist, midway on life’s path; presumably he has another 11 or so novels still in him. Powers has won a National Book Award and has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; he has been the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant”; he has elicited lavish praise from the critics — most of them, anyway. Two of the words most frequently employed in connection with his literary output are “cerebral” and “ambitious.” “Cerebral” refers to his tendency to lace his novels with scientific and scholarly themes, like artificial intelligence in “Galatea 2.2,” game theory in “Prisoner’s Dilemma” and musicology cum genetic recombination in “The Gold Bug Variations.” “Ambitious” refers to his penchant for fashioning narrative structures and symbolic networks on a heroic scale.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/books/review/orfeo-by-richard-powers.html
2014-01-10,The There There,"As a diminutive child growing up in the “landlocked Illinois” town of Moline, where John Deere built his plow-and-­tractor empire, Diane Johnson (author of the popular novel “Le Divorce,” among other books about Americans abroad) dreamed of a life of adventure, “preferably at sea, before the mast.” She fled the Flyover (as coastal sophisticates call the Midwest), first to New York, where she was part of the same cohort of aspiring college students at Mademoiselle magazine that Sylvia Plath recorded in “The Bell Jar,” then to her first marriage to a doctor in California and finally to France, where she now spends much of her time. “The one thing you, we, Americans, are not allowed to say is that there is somewhere better than America to live,” she writes, confidently having found “one of the better places.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/books/review/diane-johnsons-flyover-lives.html

2014-01-10,Life in Transit,"Elisabeth de Waal’s posthumously published novel takes place in the aftermath of some of the 20th century’s greatest calamities, as it follows Austrian exiles returning to their homeland to encounter a dramatically altered physical and psychological landscape. By 1954, when the action of the novel begins, Vienna has witnessed not only the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but the Anschluss and Hitler’s reign of terror against the Jewish population, as well as repeated bombings during World War II and simultaneous occupation by four victorious foreign powers. Written during the late 1950s, “The Exiles Return” has an immediacy that makes de Waal’s readers feel the experiences of its characters in a visceral way.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/books/review/the-exiles-return-by-elisabeth-de-waal.html
2014-01-10,Islanders,"If there were a prize for ornery old men, the ornithologist Jim Kennoway in Alice Greenway’s novel “The Bird Skinner” would trounce every recluse in New England. Refusing help from his remarkably well-­adjusted son and incredibly patient neighbors, he’s drinking and smoking himself to death on an island in Maine. Trudging along in this Lear-like existence — “Wintertime, Jesus Christ, he lived like a bear” — he’s taken by surprise by the ebullient Cadillac, a remarkable young woman from the Solomon Islands who comes to stay with him before studying medicine at Yale. (Thirty years prior, stationed in the Solomons during the Second World War, Jim befriended Cadillac’s father, with whom he has since lost all contact.) If this premise sounds familiar — striking young woman brings hope to forsaken old man — the style with which Greenway weaves her tale of memory and loss is bracing in its restraint.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/books/review/the-bird-skinner-by-alice-greenway.html

2014-01-10,Inside the List,"Order Now: For the first time in three weeks, there are new names on the hardcover lists — although “new” may not be the best word to describe the thriller writers W. E. B. Griffin (“Hazardous Duty,” No. 3) and Jack Higgins (“The Death Trade,” No. 11). Higgins is well known for his audacious story lines: His 1975 breakthrough, “The Eagle Has Landed,” concerned a Nazi plot to kidnap Churchill, while his 1989 best seller “A Season in Hell” imagined smugglers transporting heroin in the corpses of drowning victims. By those lights, “The Death Trade” — about a nuclear scientist forced to work for the Iranian government — seems almost workaday. Higgins’s eating habits are less colorful. “I’m notorious for liking very simple food,” he told Virgin Media in 2000. “You can take me to some of the world’s top restaurants and I’ll leave half of it on the plate. Food is not hugely important to me.” That’s not to say Higgins never dines out — a restaurant near his home in the Channel Islands doubles as his office, he explained in the same interview. “I go in at lunchtime, do two hours’ work, and then I eat,” he said. “And then in the evening I’ll go in and do three hours and then I’ll eat. I’ll write by hand and I get so absorbed it doesn’t bother me if the place is full or the music’s playing. It’s very common, particularly at night, for the waiters to come up and say, ‘Look, it’s 10 o’clock and you haven’t had anything to eat yet.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The works include van Gogh’s 1887 “Edge of a Wheat Field With Poppies,” which will be the first van Gogh in the museum’s collection. Besides European works the donation includes pieces by major American Impressionists like Childe Hassam and William Merritt Chase. The gift has “forever changed the museum’s ability to deliver world-class exhibitions and programs,” said Christoph Heinrich, the museum’s director, and it transforms Denver’s holdings of Impressionism into one of the most important in the Western states.

2014-01-13,Sacrificing Gated Safety for a Lover and Herself,"Chang-rae Lee’s new novel is part folk tale, part picaresque adventure, part dystopian satire. It signals a bold departure from both the carefully observed realism that distinguished Mr. Lee’s powerful earlier books “Aloft” (2004) and “A Gesture Life” (1999) — and the historical vistas of “The Surrendered” (2010). In eschewing one of his most potent gifts as a writer — his ability to map the inner lives of his characters with sympathy and precision — Mr. Lee has produced an ungainly and strangely inert novel. Instead of creating a palpably real flesh-and-blood heroine, he has chosen to center his book on an anime-like character named Fan; and instead of creating a fully imagined fictional realm (as Kazuo Ishiguro did in his bravura sci-fi-like novel, “Never Let Me Go,” from 2005), he’s dropped Fan into a futuristic world that seems at once overly familiar and unconvincing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/books/on-such-a-full-sea-chang-rae-lees-tale-of-dystopia.html

Feuer, who moved upstate several years ago and commutes to his eponymous Chelsea gallery, says he wanted to try something “outside the pressure cooker.” Even Retrospective’s name alludes to what Mesler, the owner of Untitled Gallery on the Lower East Side, called the “speed of the art world” — in which younger and younger artists land exhibitions surveying their already oversize careers. “But ‘Retrospective’ also sounds like an ’80s rock band,” he adds.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/art-matters-two-downtown-manhattan-gallerists-join-forces-upstate/

(Scientists, however, have since discredited his methods and data.) The designer Ted Muehling has contributed polished quartz ovals ($200 each) that weigh, yes, 0.75 ounces. His staff grinds the stones at a workshop behind his Manhattan boutique, on machines with wet sandpaper wheels that emit mournful sounds as they spin. Mr. Muehling, who was brought up Catholic, said the translucent stones remind him of his childhood image of the soul as an internal vapor that grows cloudier with every sin. The polished talismans are also ecumenically reminiscent of crystal orbs that Buddhist temple statues carry and pebbles that Jews place on gravestones.

If you’re searching for flash, look to Darling Harbour, where celebrity chefs like David Chang and Luke Nguyen have opened outposts in the Star, a ritzy casino and entertainment complex that reopened in 2011 after a renovation costing around $800 million. For more discreet indulgences, seek out the diminutive drinking dens that now pepper the city, the result of a change in local liquor licensing laws that finally made business viable for small bars.

Mr. Mangum stayed largely out of sight as the album’s reputation spread and solidified, but his solo concerts showed him fully in command.

2014-01-16,What Was Behind All Those Whacks?,"Christina Ricci showed early that she could play creepy: One of her first film credits is as Wednesday Addams in the 1991 movie “The Addams Family.” So the role of Lizzie Borden, the odd Massachusetts woman accused of killing her father and stepmother with an ax in 1892, seems a logical fit. “Lizzie Borden Took an Ax,” a telling of the real-life story being shown on Saturday at 8 p.m. on Lifetime, isn’t shy about speculating on what actually happened in the Borden household in Fall River that bloody August day, though that has remained in dispute for more than a century. The movie also presents the record of Lizzie’s arrest and trial, whose conclusion won’t be spoiled here for the sake of those not up on their murder history. The cast includes Billy Campbell as Lizzie’s lawyer and Clea DuVall as her sister, Emma. Also listed are credits for three “Jump Rope Girls.” You can probably guess why, though the film reminds us that the oft-chanted rhyme is inaccurate. The figures of 40 and 41 whacks are greatly inflated. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/television/what-was-behind-all-those-whacks.html

2014-01-16,Raf Simons’s Colorful Collaboration With Sterling Ruby for Fall/Winter 2014,"Last night, the Belgian designer Raf Simons and the Los Angeles artist Sterling Ruby presented their collaborative fall/winter 2014 collection in a gutted raw space just off the Place Vendome in Paris. “We have done the whole thing together,” Simons said backstage about creating the label Raf Simons/Sterling Ruby with his friend of nine years. The two met through a gallerist when Simons first purchased a piece of Ruby’s art, and collaborated several years ago on a capsule collection of denim jeans and jackets. For this one-off set of designs for the label, which was presented in place of Simons’s eponymous line, Ruby decked out the runway with his signature large-scale sculptures. Shaped like red-white-and-blue fangs dripping from the ceilings, the artwork set the scene for the colorful clothes: khaki trench coats artfully appliquéd with brightly colored fabric strips and various articles emblazoned with words like “father” and “Abu Lang,” which Ruby explained stood for the phrase “abusive language.” “We loaded a lot of things into the clothing, both in terms of iconography and also our own path,” Ruby added. The pieces spattered with color were the most literal references to their craft — a real artist’s wardrobe.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/perfect-pairing-raf-simonss-colorful-collaboration-with-sterling-ruby-for-fallwinter-2014/

I have this memory of Pallett pacing about in the dark, cavernous studio, his pad in hand as he came up with ideas for each of the shorts.

He explained that they weren’t quite high enough during the first round of sampling, so he had to go back to the factory for a little retooling. “We can all use a little bit of height,” he said, smiling. In Milan, the platform lace-ups at Marni were a bit chunkier, giving a little extra lift.

He relayed a few messages through me to her, as he lay dying. His wife did well in her role as caregiver, running an in-house hospice for him. But their marriage was — by his account and all available evidence — in shambles for years. His wife knew the mistress existed, and only in the waning months of his life did my friend sever the extramarital relationship (in order to die with less complexity at home). There will be a funeral, hosted by his family. The dilemma: Enact the expressed will of my friend and ensure the mistress is present or — given the wife’s emotional fragility and proneness to angry outbursts — enact my friend’s constant goal of peace and simplicity for his child.

His book navigates five centuries of painful documents, atrocious statements and dubious literature to argue that the United States was, from its beginning, as much a Spanish colonial southern enterprise as an unending march westward.

It’s the 25th book in her “Dark” series of paranormal romances, about a race of shape-shifters called the Carpathians — basically, kindhearted vampires who refuse to kill humans and often have energetic, soul-trembling sex with them. Feehan discovered her calling while she was still in middle school; speaking with the romance website RBL Romantica early in her career, she remembered sitting in math class and working on her first steamy love scene until the teacher confiscated her notebook. “You should have seen his face,” she said. “I was about 13 at the time. I don’t know which of us was more mortified.” But despite her early start she delayed publishing for a long time, working more than 20 years as a martial arts instructor (she has a third-degree black belt in karate) and writing for herself while she and her husband raised 11 children. “I can write with the entire household around me most of the time,” she told another website in 2002. “My husband reads all my books and had better love them — and if he doesn’t, he’d better lie like crazy with a smile on his face. The only thing I avoid while writing a love scene is my children.

A professor, scholar and novelist, he completed a journey to the Black Sea in 1986, just before the fall of the old Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. Like Marsigli, he had no very clear idea of what kind of book he wanted to write, yet in the end, Magris produced “Danube,” a masterpiece.

2014-01-17,Austin City Limits,"Feeling like a fraud or a con artist can be a hazard of the writing profession; there’s a fine line, Balzac wrote, between the artist and the criminal. That’s certainly true of Frankie Abandonato — a New York grifter who makes the critical error of pulling a lottery scam on a mobster. Abandonato, the hero of James Magnuson’s novel “Famous Writers I Have Known,” slips town for Texas, holing up at a creative writing institute where he’s mistaken for a J. D. Salingeresque recluse named V. S. Mohle. (The real Mohle was expected on campus to teach a seminar while either reconciling or settling an old score — it’s complicated — with the institute’s fabulously successful founder, Rex Schoeninger, whose sprawling social novels are reminiscent of James Michener’s; their feud culminated years ago in a brawl on “The Dick Cavett Show,” after which Mohle dropped out of society and never published again.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/books/review/famous-writers-i-have-known-by-james-magnuson.html

Now, in her second, she takes a deep, long look at the intimate history of yet another creative man. This time, the action is viewed from two perspectives — those of Robert Louis Stevenson and (even more so) of his American wife, Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, who hopes to be a painter or a writer herself. “Under the Wide and Starry Sky” is at once a classic artistic bildungsroman and a retort to the genre, a novel that shows how love and marriage can simultaneously offer inspiration and encumbrance, especially when the more successful partner believes that, as far as artists go, “a family could tolerate only one.” The Stevensons’ story is full of morbidity and sacrifice, chronicling losses and gains — and, of course, the writing of classics like “Treasure Island,” “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” and “Kidnapped,” none of which, Horan suggests, would have been possible without Fanny Stevenson’s careful nurturing of her husband.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/books/review/under-the-wide-and-starry-sky-by-nancy-horan.html

Ryan’s destination is Moscow, his target a Russian businessman plotting to crash the American economy through a terrorist attack.

2014-01-20,A.P.C. and Bonton Design Children’s Wear That’s Too Cool for School,"The A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou believes that children are never too young to be exposed to good design.

When the school’s art department needed uniforms for the children to wear while painting, Touitou turned to Bonton, the hip French children’s clothier — whose founders, Thomas and Irène Cohen, are the son and daughter-in-law of the owners of Bonpoint and have a daughter in Lily’s class. The uniforms also ended up in Bonton’s five retail outlets, where they became a best seller. “The design was the right balance between playful and straight,” Touitou says. “I sort of knew that we’d have kids together one day, so to speak.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/perfect-pairing-a-p-c-and-bonton-design-childrens-wear-thats-too-cool-for-school/

2014-01-20,South Africa: Rhino Killings Increase," Poachers killed 1,004 rhinos in South Africa last year, up from 668 in 2012, as they continue to hunt the animals for their valuable horns, the South African government reported Friday. The Department of Environmental Affairs blamed poachers who cross the border from Mozambique to South Africa, then sell the horns to places like Vietnam and China, where they are symbols of wealth and are used in potions. The number of rhinos illegally killed in South Africa has been climbing since at least 2010, when 333 deaths were reported. Susie Ellis, of the global nonprofit group International Rhino Foundation, said the latest figure was almost certainly an undercount. “Those are only the deaths that we know about,” she said. Traffic, an international wildlife watchdog group, said Mozambique treated rhino-related crimes as misdemeanors.

2014-01-20,Turkey: Contentious Medical Bill Signed," Over the objections of human rights and medical groups, President Abdullah Gul signed a measure into law on Friday that makes it a crime to administer emergency first aid without government authorization. Critics contend that the law could be used by the police and prosecutors to intimidate and punish doctors and other medical workers for treating protesters wounded in demonstrations against the government, like those in Turkey last year. “Passing a bill that criminalizes emergency care and punishes those who care for injured protesters is part of the Turkish government’s relentless effort to silence any opposing voices,” said Dr. Vincent Iacopino, senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups that had campaigned against the legislation. If convicted, violators could be imprisoned for up to three years and face fines of nearly $1 million.

2014-01-20,Japan: Lawmaker Defends Shrine Visit," A top Japanese lawmaker on Friday denounced American criticism of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit last month to a Tokyo war shrine, comparing it to American politicians’ paying their respects at Arlington National Cemetery. The lawmaker, Koichi Hagiuda of Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, said it was unfair for the United States to expect Japanese leaders to refrain from visiting the Yasukuni shrine, which honors the nation’s war dead, when American politicians can freely honor their fallen soldiers. “If Japan says, ‘It’s unfavorable to pay a visit to Arlington National Cemetery,’ do they refrain from going there?” Mr. Hagiuda, a special adviser to Mr. Abe, was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News Agency. “I assume the United States will say, ‘It’s none of a foreign country’s business.’ ” Mr. Hagiuda was responding to an American government statement expressing disappointment with Mr. Abe’s visit to the controversial Shinto shrine on Dec. 26. Washington feared such a visit could anger other Asian nations, where Yasukuni is viewed as a symbol of Japan’s refusal to come to terms with its brutal 20th-century militarism because it honors all war dead, including convicted war criminals. The shrine also houses a museum that views World War II as a noble struggle by Japan to liberate Asia from white imperialism.

2014-01-20,What’s on Saturday,"9 P.M. (Showtime) SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper, above), who has returned to the home of his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) after eight months in a mental institution, following a violent crime, tries to tackle the world — and reclaim his estranged wife, Nikki, who took out a restraining order against him — through a physical and psychological regimen he created while locked away. Then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a heartbreaker who persuades Pat that she can circumvent the law by passing a letter from him to Nikki — if only he’ll enter a dance contest with her. Soon, she is leading, and he is following. “For all its high-flying zaniness, the movie has the sting of life, and its humor feels dredged up from the same dark, boggy place from which Samuel Beckett extracted his yuks,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this best picture Oscar nominee directed by David O. Russell, which also earned nominations for Mr. Cooper, Ms. Weaver and Mr. De Niro, and a win for Ms. Lawrence. “ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ is crammed with people talking and shouting and weeping and also yielding to what are sometimes called boundary issues but which here turn out to be the mad, loving scrambling of people finding and saving one another,” Ms. Dargis added. “These are characters who get in one another’s faces and occasionally punch a loved one right in the kisser.

2014-01-20,What’s On Today?,"1:30 P.M. (Showtime2) AMÉLIE (2001) Audrey Tautou, above, in her breakthrough role, plays a French sprite working as a waitress who lays out elaborate practical jokes as payback for those who offend her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amélie finds herself incapable of revealing her feelings and instead turns Paris, recreated through sets and computer-generated imagery, into a kind of treasure hunt as she leaves clues about her identity, and he trails after her. Writing in The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell called this comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose original title was “Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain,” “a sugar-rush of a movie.” It has, he said, “a hypnotic sense of romance; it’s a fable filled with longing, with a heroine who constantly flirts with failure.” The film’s “fastidious complex of flesh and fantasy is a dazzling achievement,” he added. There is no denying, he said “that ‘Amélie’ is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/whats-on-today.html

2014-01-20,What’s on Monday,"8:10 A.M. (Starz) CHARLIE BARTLETT (2008) After being kicked out of private school for making fake IDs, Charlie (Anton Yelchin, above) goes the public route, arriving at a high school in a chauffeured limousine, wearing a navy blazer with a Latin insignia and toting a briefcase. An instant pariah, he discovers a road to popularity paved with prescription drugs. Soon, he has become a sort of therapist, dispensing advice and medication to classmates. Hope Davis plays his flaky, depressed mother; Robert Downey Jr. is the high school’s alcoholic principal, whose relationship with Charlie turns into warfare, once he learns that Charlie is dating his rebellious daughter (Kat Dennings). “In the movie’s funniest scene, Charlie and his business partner, Murphy, the school bully who beat him up and dunked his head in the toilet when he first arrived, dispense Ritalin to the students and turn a dance into a frenzied free-for-all with bare-breasted girls running down the halls,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The movie, directed by Jon Poll from a screenplay by Gustin Nash, is never more amusingly subversive than in this scene, which suggests the hypocrisy of American attitudes toward drugs without putting it in words.” Still, he said, “as the movie dashes from one base to the next, it never coalesces into the character-driven, serious comedy with heart that you want it be.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/20/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

E. Cummings and T. S. Eliot. They include dozens of notebooks containing observations, notes, doodles, clippings and extensive drafts of poems, published and unpublished. There is also wide correspondence, audio and video recordings, childhood writings and diaries. Mr. Collins, 72, said by email that he had decided to sell his papers when he “started making a mental pile” and realized just how much material there was, including more than a few jottings on cocktail napkins, envelopes and other scraps. “I remember one occasion when the lines of a poem occurred to me while I was walking around the city with no pen and nothing to write on,” he said. “So I ducked into a bank and started writing the poem, standing up, on the backs of deposit slips. I used the bank pen that was attached to a desk with a chain, all of which made for a rather short poem.

The high radiation level suggests that the water had leaked from inside the reactor itself, where it would have come in contact with the melted-down fuel core. Nearly three years after the accident, the exact condition of the plant’s three damaged reactors remains unclear since high radiation levels and flooding make it impossible for workers to inspect them.

2014-01-21,What’s on Tuesday,"9 P.M. (13, 49) SALINGER (2013) With Paul Alexander’s book “Salinger” as his starting point, Shane Salerno layers biographical material with archival photographs, re-enactments and interviews with high school students, celebrities and even murderers to shed light on J. D. Salinger, above — from his World War II experiences and relationships with younger women to his decision to live in a fortress of privacy. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton, John Cusack, Martin Sheen, Tom Wolfe and Gore Vidal offer perspective. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film, presented here by “American Masters,” “less a work of cinema than the byproduct of its own publicity campaign.” He added: “It does not so much explore the life and times of J. D. Salinger as run his memory and legacy through a spin cycle of hype. Salinger moved to the woods of New Hampshire partly to escape the intrusions and indignities of American celebrity culture. ‘Salinger’ is that culture’s revenge.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

News reports said at least some of the reassigned officers took part in the large corruption investigation. Government critics fear the continuing changes in personnel — hundreds of police officers have already been purged — are meant to derail the investigation. Government officials insist, however, that the changes are legitimate efforts to eliminate what they call a “parallel state.” That refers to those in the judiciary and the police force loyal to a rival of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Wednesday’s reshuffle followed the relocation on Tuesday of nearly 100 judges and prosecutors, a move made during Mr. Erdogan’s first visit in five years to Brussels, where he confronted European Union officials’ concerns about the separation of powers and a free judiciary in Turkey.

Callahan’s opening act, Lonnie Holley, had been playing to similar audiences for two years. A number of details about Holley made this fact surprising: He was decades older than just about everyone in the club and one of the few African-Americans. He says he grew up the seventh of 27 children in Jim Crow-era Alabama, where his schooling stopped around seventh grade. In his own, possibly unreliable telling, he says the woman who informally adopted him as an infant eventually traded him to another family for a pint of whiskey when he was 4. Holley also says he dug graves, picked trash at a drive-in, drank too much gin, was run over by a car and pronounced brain-dead, picked cotton, became a father at 15 (Holley now has 15 children), worked as a short-order cook at Disney World and did time at a notoriously brutal juvenile facility, the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/magazine/lonnie-holley-the-insiders-outsider.html

On Mount Lykaion (“wolf mountain”) in Arcadia, annual traditions honoring Zeus re-enacted a seminal rite of human sacrifice. In Plato’s “Republic,” the casual observation is made that in Athens anyone who wished to injure an enemy could commission a magician to cast a harmful spell; “for with their incantations and magic formulas they say they can persuade the gods to serve their will.” Similarly, archaeologists have discovered grotesque little voodoo-like figures bristling with spikes, and curse tablets that were inscribed with malevolent prayers during this Golden Age of humanism and reason.

Years later, wild with stage fright, he hid in a bathroom to avoid getting a trophy on the dais. By adulthood, Stossel was saddled with often incapacitating nerves. His new book, “My Age of Anxiety,” uses his experience as a guide through the disorder, tracing its legacy in thought and culture. He seeks to understand what anxiety is and what it means; he probes the condition’s ambiguities. The result is ambitious, and bravely intimate: a ruminative book that often breaks into a thrilling intellectual chase.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/my-age-of-anxiety-by-scott-stossel.html

Mr. McDarrah, who died in 2007, was the first photo editor and for decades the only staff photographer of The Village Voice. He had a front-row seat for multiple revolutions, with access that photographers today cannot imagine. “You could be standing three feet from Jimi Hendrix at a cocktail party and start shooting,” said Mr. McDarrah’s son Patrick, 47. “You could never just do that now with Jay Z.” Back then, said Mr. McDarrah’s other son, Timothy, 51, “We’d answer the phone and it would be, ‘Hi, it’s Andy, is Freddie there?’ ”",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/nyregion/photographing-new-york-of-the-1960s-and-70s.html
2014-01-24,Should Pope Francis Rethink Abortion?,"Pope Francis has raised expectations of a turn away from the dogmatic intransigence that has long cast a pall over the religious life of many Roman Catholics. His question “Who am I to judge?” suggested a new attitude toward homosexuality, and he is apparently willing to consider allowing the use of contraceptives to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. But his position on what has come to be the hierarchy’s signature issue — abortion — seems unyielding. “Reason alone is sufficient to recognize the inviolable value of each single human life,” he declared in his recent apostolic exhortation, “Evangelii Gaudium,” adding: “Precisely because this involves the internal consistency of our message about the value of the human person, the church cannot be expected to change her position on this question.”I want to explore the possibility, however, that the pope might be open to significant revision of the absolute ban on abortion by asking what happens if we take seriously his claim that “reason alone is sufficient” to adjudicate this issue. What actually follows regarding abortion once we accept the “inviolable value of each single human life”? This appeal to rational reflection has been a central feature of the tradition of Catholic moral teaching. I put forward the following reflections in the spirit of this tradition.There is considerable rational basis for moral concern about abortions. In many (probably most) cases, it would be immoral to abort a pregnancy. (Note, however, that this by no means implies that most abortions actually performed are immoral.) Late-term fetuses, for example, are no different biologically or psychologically from babies born prematurely at the same stage of development. It’s hard to see how killing a premature baby is immoral but killing an identical late-term fetus isn’t. At a minimum, aborting a healthy late-term fetus would, except when the mother’s life is at risk, be immoral — which is no doubt why it is seldom, if ever, done.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/should-pope-francis-rethink-abortion/

In 2007, she began toying with sculpture in the form of small-scale works festooned with jewels and anchored by sand-cast silver bases. Beginning January 28, they will be on display at Gagosian’s London gallery in her latest fine-art exhibition, “animalvegetablemineral,” which takes its name from a parlor game. The works incorporate flora and fauna motifs, as well as rough, unpolished geodes — the raw material for the precious stones de Castellane knows and loves. Each is presented beneath a glass globe (“as they would in a natural history museum,” she explains) and christened with a girlish name (Cana Glitter Night Baby, Lunae Lumen Holly Clorum). And although the pieces are art, de Castellane couldn’t help but incorporate a sparkling bauble, to be detached and worn, into each one. “Creating jewelry is my way of expressing myself,” she says. “It’s like a language.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/on-view-victoire-de-castellanes-blinged-out-sculptures-at-gagosian/

He was living in New York in the late 1940s and studying at N.Y.U. on the G.I. Bill when he would duck out between classes, Rolleiflex in hand, and wander around the city. Penn Station was a cherished spot, even before it was slated for demolition. “When I look at the pictures now and I see the magnificence of it, I think, How could anybody knock this thing down?” Chandoha says. “It’s like knocking down the Colosseum or the Brandenburg Gate.

But throughout the years of my husband’s career as a diplomat, spent mostly in chaotic corners of Africa and Latin America, we acquired guns: mementos of the often-turbulent history that we witnessed.

There was plenty of bookish inspiration in 2013, but the results elicited less enthusiasm. Martin Scorsese’s Oscar contender, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” was adapted from a memoir by Jordan Belfort. (The book begins: “You’re lower than pond scum.”) The movie’s leading man, Leonardo DiCaprio, also played the most famous literary character brought to the screen in 2013: Jay Gatsby.

The stories of his new collection, “Leaving the Sea,” still contain peculiar linguistic and perceptual tics, but he has added to his arsenal narratives that are less relentlessly unfamiliar, less rigorously dis-enchanted, populated by characters full of longing and visible regret, though for what is not always clear. For fans of the old style, like me, there are still plenty of messed-up points of view, and we can be reassured that while most of the work in this collection begins on familiar ground, it happily disintegrates into confusion and dread. In the end Marcus presents a deeper range of identification for the reader, more emotional complexity, but still plenty of the chair-gripping alienation that marked his previous books.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/leaving-the-sea-stories-by-ben-marcus.html

Casting was a simple matter of sitting by the director while he flipped through acting photo directories and selected his preference. Theater was no different. When I took to writing plays in the ’70s, it was understood that if two mature women were talking onstage, audience members would cough and shift in their seats, but if two men of any age were talking, the audience would pay some attention. And if a man of any age and a young woman were alone onstage, you could hear a pin drop. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/writer-of-a-certain-age.html

Sue Monk Kidd followed this principle in her best-selling first novel, “The Secret Life of Bees,” in which a 14-year-old white girl and her family’s black servant join in fleeing abuse in the South Carolina of the civil rights era. Kidd’s latest novel, “The Invention of Wings,” also set largely in South Carolina, involves another unusual duo, in this case a slave and a daughter of the family that owns her.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/the-invention-of-wings-by-sue-monk-kidd.html

The ship was empty and its crew missing, although its cargo and provisions were intact, as were the crew’s possessions. The weather was calm and the ship was seaworthy, but no trace of the crew — or of the captain’s wife and 2-year-old child — was ever found. Newspapers around the world carried the story, and it inspired one of Arthur Conan Doyle’s first published pieces of fiction, “J. Habakuk Jephson’s Statement,” printed anonymously in the British journal Cornhill. From then until the present, dozens of other investigations, novels, historical accounts, television documentaries and movies have been devoted to what has become the prototypical ghost ship.

2014-01-24,Commitment,"Roddy Doyle’s new novel, “The Guts,” begins with a conversation about Facebook. Jimmy Rabbitte, the hero of Doyle’s 1987 novel, “The Commitments,” and a key figure in that book’s two successors, “The Snapper” and “The Van,” sits in a pub with his father, Jimmy Sr. The two men are arguing (or simply talking; it can be difficult to tell in Doyle’s starkly profane dialect), and the son explains social networking thus to his dad: “It’s like a club but yeh have your own room, for the people yeh want to meet. Except there’s no room an’ yeh meet no one. Unless yeh want to.” For a moment, perhaps, we think we know what to expect: a rambunctious comedy about aging musicians, working-class life, rock ’n’ roll, something fundamentally upbeat, because that’s what Doyle does. Even his darker books — “The Woman Who Walked Into Doors,” say, that raw tale of a woman’s abuse at the hands of her alcoholic husband — have a way of seeming spry, sunny underneath their patina of hardscrabble realism. So we’re ready for the comedy of crusty ­middle-aged Jimmy and his father navigating the dubious world of text messaging and mobile phones (after all, we haven’t seen them fleshed out in a novel since the 1990 of “The Van”).

The book doesn’t arrive without controversy: Ailes, the founder and president of Fox News Channel, refused to cooperate with Sherman and went so far as to grant exclusive access to a rival journalist, the Rush Limbaugh biographer Zev Chafets, in evident hopes of pre-empting Sherman with a friendlier account. (Chafets’s book, “Roger Ailes: Off Camera,” was published in March 2013 and spent a week on the e-book nonfiction list.) On NPR’s “Fresh Air” last month, Sherman described his efforts to interview Ailes in terms that called to mind Michael Moore’s early documentary “Roger and Me,” about the General Motors chief executive Roger Smith. “I reached out to Roger Ailes more than a dozen times in the two and a half years I was doing the researching and writing, both in person and in writing,” he said. “I traveled to different states to see him at public events to tell him I was eager to sit down and discuss every fact in the book. Ultimately, it was his decision not to participate.” Ailes’s opposition, he continued, had provided “a crash course in what it must be like to be involved in a political campaign. . . . I’m not the story. Roger Ailes is the story.

2014-01-27,U.S. Catholics Hope for 2015 Papal Visit," Pope Francis may make his first trip as pope to the United States in September 2015 to attend the Roman Catholic Church’s World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. Popes traditionally attend these events, which have been held every three years since 1994. “We are planning as if Pope Francis will be with us and have no indication that he will not attend,” said Kenneth A. Gavin, a spokesman for the archdiocese of Philadelphia. But he added that any reports that Francis would make the trip “are not official.” There is speculation that Francis would stop in New York on that same trip to speak to the United Nations General Assembly, but Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese of New York, said the archdiocese had not heard anything from the Vatican. The last papal visit to the United States was in April 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Washington and New York.

(Starz) THIS IS THE END (2013) A group of funny guys — among them, from left above, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and Danny McBride, each playing himself — gather at a party at Mr. Franco’s house in Los Angeles, during which events foretold in the Book of Revelation occur. The righteous are raptured up to heaven; the rest, including many of the most famous people in Hollywood, are swallowed into fiery pits or pursued by horned demons. The movie, written and directed by Mr. Rogen and Evan Goldberg, “at its phoned-in worst and also at its riotous best, has a terminal feeling,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It suggests that a comic subgenre based on the immaturity, sexual panic and self-mocking tendencies of men who should be old enough to know better has reached its expiration date.” But, “as crude as the movie’s humor often is, its spirit is sweet, sensitive and innocuous. In their script for ‘Superbad,’ Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg zeroed in on the tenderness and vulnerability that lie at the heart of male friendship, and here they go even further, using the prospect of global annihilation as an occasion for some touchy-feely relationship workshopping.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

And in the final analysis, this seems to me to be a matter of profound social inequality.

As crime rates have dropped, the public has registered support for reforms that would have fewer nonviolent offenders languishing in prison. For three years in a row, the population of America’s prisons has inched down; 13 states closed prisons last year. Efforts to fix the perpetual misery machine that is our criminal justice system have won support not only from progressives and academics but from conservatives (both fiscal and evangelical), from enlightened law enforcement groups, from business and even from advocates for crime victims.

(Flix) A ROOM WITH A VIEW (1986) An Englishwoman (Helena Bonham Carter, above left with Judi Dench)) is torn between her strait-laced fiancé (Daniel Day-Lewis) and a young bohemian (Julian Sands) in this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster’s 1908 novel, with an Oscar-winning screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby said the film “is like a holiday out of time.” In Robert Altman’s “Gosford Park” (2001), at 10, a coterie of aristocrats and their servants gather for a weekend shooting party at a grand English country estate in November 1932, during which their host, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) is murdered.

I found out that there is a huge cast of characters the Clintons have collected over the years. Their perspective and place in this world is an essential part of who Hillary is and what her future might look like. A person who went to Georgetown with Bill Clinton told me lots of his classmates were thinking about running for president, but only Clinton was building his cabinet. They’re unique in American politics in that they’ve collected so many people over the years — from Arkansas to the White House and to whatever she does in the future.

Mr. Ramnarine, who was in the middle of a trial, made a deal with federal prosecutors that he would not challenge any sentence of 10 years or less in prison. Last week, Mr. Johns took a turn on the witness stand, testifying that he had cut ties with Mr. Ramnarine after seeing a copy of his sculpture. “I was shown the cast of a flag I had never authorized,” he told the court. “And it had come from Brian.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/foundry-owner-accused-of-forging-johns-sculptures-pleads-guilty-to-wire-fraud/

2014-01-28,What’s On Tuesday,"6 P.M. (Starz Cinema) ORANGES AND SUNSHINE (2011) Emily Watson, above, portrays Margaret Humphreys, a social worker in Nottingham, England, who, starting in 1986, exposed the deportation of as many as 130,000 children from orphanages and group homes in Britain to Australia between the 1940s and 1967. One deportee, now an adult, recalls that he was told, at 10, that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents — mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit — were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. “This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreys’s 1994 book, “Empty Cradles.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

A United Nations Security Council committee has been investigating whether the shipment violated sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.

Every set of a TV show is a little reminiscent of a ragged Civil War camp, with its provisional tents and huddled groups of conferring higher-ups and wandering assistants tending to disparate needs. But on the “House of Cards” set — temporarily erected in a small park adjacent to a block of Baltimore townhouses — this feeling was heightened by the presence of Willimon, with his facial hair that might be best described as “sort-of mutton chops”; his beeline intensity; and, of course, that name: Beau Willimon, which seems perfectly suited to a brass plaque in the South somewhere, commemorating a particularly brave or foolhardy general. His hair was an unkempt pompadour, and he wore an untucked work shirt, unlaced work boots and jeans with a back pocket so tattered that it barely cradled his wallet, a situation that at least three people, including me, felt moved to warn him about it, though he waved each of us off in turn. He had the haunted look of a man who’s worried about something much more important, and he’d only just arrived on set.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/magazine/the-post-hope-politics-of-house-of-cards.html

While the annual festival has thrived, the fortunes of this nonprofit society have ebbed and flowed. In 2011, the organization expanded its footprint with the addition of the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center. But the society also recently underwent a leadership shake-up, its second in three years, and its year-round offerings face stiff competition from other screens around the city and online.

The arduous task of quickly collecting all that ice for an exhibition that opens in early January begins in mid-December, and the ice city has been getting bigger every year. This time around, 180,000 cubic meters of ice were used. Some of the finished sculptures this year, which remain in place until March, are a homage to structures around the world, from the Colosseum to the Empire State Building. Zengyu Wang, the executive manager of the event, says the local government in Harbin dreamed up the festival as a lure to promote winter tourism. When visitors see the ice for the first time, he says, they have one reaction: “Very shocked.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/magazine/the-empire-state-building-in-ice.html

As children went from helping on the farm to being the focus of relentless cosseting, they shifted “from being our employees to our bosses,” Jennifer Senior observes in her trenchant and engrossing first book, “All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood.” Senior, a contributing editor at New York magazine, examines what it means to be a parent, through interviews with a handful of families who are neither typical nor extraordinary. These are snapshots, not longitudinal documentaries, but in the way of good snapshots, they tell more than one might notice at first glance, and they allow for cautious universalizing. She supplements these vignettes with extremely impressive research, weaving in insights from philosophy, psychology and an occasionally overwhelming mélange of social science reports.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/books/review/all-joy-and-no-fun-by-jennifer-senior.html

Alfred Dreyfus. Dreyfus was a 35-year-old artillery officer, a high-ranking graduate of the elite École Polytechnique and the École de Guerre (the French Army’s war college), and was chosen on the basis of his grades and overall performance to train with the army’s general staff. Robert Harris, in his fine novel “An Officer and a Spy,” lucidly retells the famous, bizarrely complicated and chilling story. His narrator is Lt. Col. Georges Picquart, who was promoted to that grade six months after Dreyfus’s arrest and put in charge of the general staff’s statistical section (the coy sobriquet of a counter­intelligence unit), and went on to become one of Dreyfus’s improbable and indispensable saviors.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/books/review/an-officer-and-a-spy-by-robert-harris.html

A few weeks of elementary surveillance had shown them the vulnerability of the target: There were no cameras to elude, no alarms to disconnect. Because the building contained residential apartments, the group chose the night of the first Joe Frazier-­Muhammad Ali heavyweight championship fight, an ideal distraction. It turned out that the Pennsylvania office, like so many others across the country, had almost no physical protection. Security was largely symbolic, resting on the bureau’s carefully buffed reputation for efficiency in tracking down America’s “most wanted” criminals, from bank robbers to atomic spies.

If you were to go by the output of a certain strand of young, male British fiction writer, you could easily be forgiven for thinking the main activity of British life is being disgusted by the physical form of oneself and one’s fellows. Ian McEwan began a short story noting the peculiar smell asparagus lends the urine (“it suggests sexual activity of some kind between exotic creatures”). Martin Amis spent large parts of his early career detailing his characters’ bleeding gums and cracked molars. Will Self’s books come so awash in bodily fluids that if you were to throw them against a wall they’d most likely stick. Male self-disgust, rooted in the moist tumult of adolescence, and extended into one’s 20s and 30s under cover of literary careers aping the clinical imperturbability of Nabokov and Joyce, has almost bequeathed us its own genre. We might call it, in the manner of those outraged letters to British broadsheets, “Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/books/review/byron-easy-by-jude-cook.html

Returning home, he underwent scores of surgeries and in 2006 married his sweetheart in Illinois. The marriage didn’t last, and Ziegel died in December 2012. But nobody who saw the “Marine Wedding” series will be able to forget him — or the damage wrought by war on his body, his life and his family.

Readers of even passing acquaintance with the Vietnam War will most likely know of Jeremiah Denton’s televised 1966 interview — one of the first glimpses of the life of United States military pilots who had been shot down and captured. American viewers watched in horror and puzzlement as Denton, an emaciated, hunched figure dressed in gray prison garb, defiantly telegraphed the word t-o-r-t-u-r-e by blinking out the letters in Morse code. His brave act was followed by yet more torture, and some time later Vietnamese authorities bundled him along with 10 other men out of the infamous Hanoi Hilton, as Hoa Lo prison in the North Vietnamese capital was known (and where John McCain, probably the most famous P.O.W. of the war, would be held).
