Many characters are people to whom the real Hollywood would have been hostile. They include Archie (Jeremy Pope), an aspiring screenwriter who is black and gay, and has a movie to sell. He teams up with a young director (Darren Criss) to make that dream a reality. “The bid to make Archie’s movie starts as a glitzy, funny, gimlet-eyed dissection of bigotry and power,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Then it lurches, halfway through, into a pep talk about what some kids can accomplish if they gather up their moxie and put on a show.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-hollywood-and-prop-culture.html

It was a muggy afternoon in the spring of 2015, and I was in Tokyo at the opening of her new Miu Miu store. I had been waiting in line to congratulate her. The lights above me hung bright and hot, and I knew without looking that I had sweated through the tailored suit I’d been given to wear for the occasion. A famous French actress stood two people ahead of me at the front of the line. Her arms Pietà’d out as she approached the Italian designer, hands landing confidently on Mrs. Prada’s shoulders, and, as if tracing the line of a toppled-over parabola, she kissed her — mwah — on the left cheek, and then again — mwah — on the right. The next person followed suit, making it through the exchange without incident. Then it was my turn. I kind of cranked forward and cupped Mrs. Prada’s waist the way a high school junior might initiate a slow dance. Then I lurched even closer, barely grazing one side of her cheek on the first try. On the second, determined this time to make contact, I touched the hinge of her lips to mine.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/t-magazine/cheek-kiss.html

Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/dining/drinks/sparkling-wine-disgorging-coronavirus.html

Their white neighbors had turned on them with a viciousness that was gratuitous and grotesque — a cruelty too extravagant to be understood as a matter of mere survival. “It was not that the white American worker was threatened with starvation,” Du Bois wrote, pointing to the booming wartime economy, “but it was what was, after all, a more important question — whether or not he should lose his front-room and Victrola and even the dream of a Ford car.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/books/review-walter-johnson-broken-heart-of-america-st-louis.html

Perhaps that’s why Daniel Alfredson’s filmmaking feels most confident in this, the final entry of his thematically connected “Intrigo” series (now available on digital and on demand). The films take place in the fictional European town of Maardam, but the setting feels most fully realized here, with cameras panning the seemingly idyllic pastoral scenery of Samaria, the farm where the movie’s mystery is centered.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/movies/intrigo-samaria-review-an-old-murder-mystery-unearthed.html

I’ve been thinking a lot about Snyder lately, along with other nature-minded writers like Annie Dillard and Barry Lopez, as I’ve grown more restless during lockdown and started spending time in the deep woods where I live. (OK, they’re not that deep. But neither was Walden — Thoreau brought laundry to his mother’s house! — and they at least give the illusion of solitude.) Snyder’s no hermit. One thing I admire about his work is its sense of fellowship: how alert it is to the links between land and politics and culture. He writes about nature, sure, but also about human nature. In honor of his birthday, maybe spend a few minutes reading “Axe Handles” or “Above Pate Valley.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/books/review/10-new-books-to-read-this-week.html

But with artworks arriving and her guests expected, she shrugged at the massing clouds, determined the evening should go on. The furniture was taken inside and then reassembled an hour later once the shower had passed. Looking back now, from a radically altered world of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing, guests fondly recall the evening as one of the last when they were able to mingle freely with friends old and new. “It’s wonderful to remember that dinner now,” said Schurer Merckoll late last month. “It feels so special because it gives me hope for more positive times to come.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/t-magazine/design-marrakech-philomena-schurer-merckoll.html

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/buddha-statues-face.html

This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/uzbekistan-history-silk-road.html

This is architecture meant to set the soul asoar, but I am conscious only of how far I am below, in the horde at the gates. Down the stairs, the bullet train waits, sleek-nosed and sealed in on itself, like a missile. A stoic janitor steers a Zamboni-like machine down the platform, buffing it to a gleam.

Then He Promoted a Questionable Cure for Covid-19.,"When diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions — that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. “Hubris,” Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, “is the most common thing in the world.” It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. “Someone who doesn’t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,” he said. “Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/magazine/didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine.html

2020-05-13,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Ophelia’ and ‘Solar Opposites’,"OPHELIA (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote “King Lear” during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on “Hamlet.” As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an “interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is “Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-ophelia-and-solar-opposites.html

A sober answer to the era’s flashy It-bags, its clean lines and functional design quickly made it a favorite among customers searching for a versatile accessory with a more timeless, cerebral feel. (Its cinematic appeal was further solidified in 2015, when the brand commissioned the American director and photographer Autumn de Wilde to create a series of surreal short films, later reprised in 2017, inspired by the bag.) As Prada prepares to enter a new era — in which Raf Simons will join Miuccia Prada as the company’s co-creative director — the Galleria will remain, its ongoing popularity a testament to the brand’s heritage. And, with many of Italy’s manufacturing businesses now operating once again and shops poised to reopen after being hard hit by the global pandemic, the leather artisans who create each iteration of the bag have recently been able to resume their craft.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/t-magazine/prada-handbag-making-of.html

The fleet-footed script is based on recordings of conversations Ellams made in barbershops in Africa and London. “The men were just laughing whilst talking about really crazy issues,” Ellams said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “I had one rule: If a topic comes up three times in three different countries, then it has to go into the play.” This production, recorded during the show’s run at the National Theater in London, is streaming until late next week as part of a series of free programming being offered during the pandemic.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-barber-shop-chronicles-and-seberg.html

But at the heart of the conspiracy theory is “unmasking,” the routine practice by which national security officials find out the names of Americans who appear on intelligence intercepts of foreign actors. Trumpists have tried to turn this into a sinister and portentous term.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/opinion/virus-rick-bright-obamagate.html

They tend to hold the book’s central mismatched-but-also-kind-of-perfect-together couple, Marianne and Connell, close to their hearts. So adapting the book for TV came with risks. “It was a big leap of faith,” Rooney told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year about casting the show, “that we were going to find people who would just get it, and would know exactly how to communicate that friction between the inner life and the outer world.” Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal have received widespread acclaim for their performances in the 12-part series on Hulu. Some of the praise for the show came from James Poniewozik, The Times’s chief television critic, who called it a “gorgeous, melancholy series” starring leads who “have so much chemistry you may need lab goggles.” Poniewozik recently joined The Times’s three book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — for a discussion I moderated about the show, the novel, the art of adaptation and more. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/books/normal-people-sally-rooney-hulu-adaptation.html

As its title intimates, this grid also has 177 “open squares,” which are empty squares that don’t touch any black block, even diagonally, third only to a 218 Patrick Berry Sunday puzzle and the aforementioned Longo puzzle. Joel Fagliano has made a 124-answer Sunday puzzle in the last year as well; all of these have been unthemed.

(The restaurant’s name means “wave” in Basque.) He has worked in Barcelona; Homer, Alaska; and, more recently, at Nana in Dallas, with the chef Anthony Bombaci. When it can fully open, Haizea will seat only around 10 instead of about 20 to facilitate social distancing.

Nearly eight years after an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found that Lance Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career — making him a pariah essentially overnight — the disgraced athlete has resurfaced to reflect on his misdeeds. This two-part documentary by the director Marina Zenovich (“Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind”), airing as part of ESPN’s “30 for 30” series, gives him ample opportunity to do so. (Although if you’ve already made up your mind on Armstrong, the former superstar cyclist, this movie might not change it.) The film packs plenty of back story, chronicling his early days as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer and the demise of his reputation after he admitted to doping in 2013. Zenovich doesn’t shy away from tough questions, and by interviewing Armstrong’s family, friends, rivals and others, she manages to create an objective portrait of a shunned star.

While the tide was out, we walked out to a small island a couple hundred feet from the shore. I wondered if I had foolishly fallen too hard for him right before a deployment. We had agreed that this wouldn’t become anything serious. Neither of us noticed the rising tide that would soon leave us stranded. He held my shoes and clothes over his head and led the way as we waded through the cold water, cutting our feet on slivers of shells while we scrambled back to the beach.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/magazine/diego-pongo-marine-iraq.html

The Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby burst onto the world stage in 2018 with “Nanette,” a Netflix special that challenged what stand-up could or should be. She even vowed to give up comedy, at least as a tool she had long used to confront trauma. In this follow-up special, named after one of her dogs, Gadsby discusses her autism diagnosis, goes after a long list of targets — particularly men and centuries-old forms of patriarchy — and delivers more self-deprecating jokes. If she knew how popular “Nanette” was going to be, she says, she would have paced herself instead of putting all her “trauma eggs into one basket.” When Gadsby performed “Douglas” Off Broadway last summer, The New York Times’s theater critic Jesse Green named it a Critic’s Pick and wrote, “‘Douglas’ is angry — even furious — and draws its comic energy from the effort to master and direct that anger into sharp insight and its byproduct, laughter.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-hannah-gadsby-americas-got-talent.html

Decades later, as social media has catapulted academic jargon into everyday vocabulary, the term has become warped to signify a restructuring of society, with minorities at the top. But still this theory — that identity categories are not mutually exclusive, but integrated components of a single, multidimensional experience — remains immensely relevant today.

2020-05-26,The Backward Logic of Austerity Threatens America’s Most Vibrant Campus,"Last month the administration at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York, announced that — in anticipation of a coming budget crisis — departments must reduce their course offerings by 25 percent. This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million.

Ten years, three countries, five cities, four dogs and two toddlers later, we’re still here, together. — Michael McClelland",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-coronavirus-its-ok-if-you-meet-someone.html

Virtual theater productions, of course, are mediated through technology and thus not experienced as they would be from the front mezzanine, and yet they’re not fully polished or always prerecorded, either. Part of the thrill of theater is its immediacy and, along with it, the potential for something to fall to pieces. That aspect remains perfectly intact, and recent performances have been felled by late starts, spotty internet and A/V connections, missed cues and poor lighting. “It can all feel like the local portions of the Jerry Lewis telethon,” jokes the producer and writer Jonathan Tolins. “As though these actors might be in their laundry rooms.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/t-magazine/zoom-tips-coronavirus.html

In his 2018 historical drama, “Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc,” the French director Bruno Dumont infused Saint Joan’s formative years with a sonic landscape that featured prominent, raucous guitar shredding. For his follow-up, “Joan of Arc,” Dumont focuses on Joan of Arc’s later years, this time using electronic pop music to help tell the story. The film casts one of the performers who played Joan in Dumont’s earlier movie, Lise Leplat Prudhomme, opposite the French pop singer Christophe, who plays one of the priests who try Joan. “Here and in the earlier picture it’s perhaps easy to apprehend Dumont’s approach with a ‘What’s this oddball up to now?’ smirk,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if Dumont is joking at all, it’s a form of what used to be called ‘kidding on the square.’”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-joan-of-arc-and-princess-mononoke.html

New York City has a complicated relationship with silence, given that the people who live there can’t really ever fully experience it. That makes the quiet of “Sidewalk Stories” even more striking. Filmed in black and white and mostly silent (à la Charlie Chaplin), the movie follows a homeless Greenwich Village street artist (played by Charles Lane, who also wrote and directed the film) who cares for an abandoned toddler in 1980s New York. When the movie came out, it was a novel mishmash of early Hollywood technique and a then-contemporary setting.

2020-05-29,An Artist Who Delights in the Minor Key,"In “I Confess,” the final essay in Moyra Davey’s new collection of prose pieces, “Index Cards” (2020), she recalls losing, as a child at school, a pencil given to her by her mother. Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: “Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?” (Why so much grief over a pencil?) That question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote — the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line — is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Davey’s work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the “tiny spark of accident” that will set off stray thoughts and images. “Index Cards,” which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey’s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/t-magazine/moyra-davey.html

It boasts a familiar but enticing list of ingredients — an orphaned hero, plucky sidekicks, shape-shifting monsters, hidden worlds, magical peacekeepers, foul deeds, fateful destinies — whisked into a story that is fast-paced, funny and sometimes surprising.
