This wasenough to put ABC on top in the hour among adults 18 to 49. At 9, ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” attracted the night’s largest audience (18.6 million), but the show’s studio audience booed the announcement that Sabrina Bryan would be sent home. The runner-up with 17.2 million viewers, Fox’s “House” at 9, delivered the night’s top ratings in the 18-to-49 group. CBS ranked third over all behind both Fox and ABC, leading the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers with “NCIS” (16.3 million). NBC was fourth, struggling early with “Singing Bee” at 8 (5.8 million) followed by a 90-minute “Biggest Loser” at 8:30 (6.3 million). At 10 NBC’s rerun of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” (8.7 million) finished second to ABC’s “Boston Legal” (11.8 million) but ahead of CBS’s “Cane” (8.1 million).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/arts/01arts-1-PUMPKINLIGHT_BRF.html

The focus of fury is Marko Perkovic, who goes by the stage name Thompson (as in the submachine gun) and whose folk-inspired heavy-metal music has drawn crowds in Europe. He has been criticized for a song that uses a slogan employed by the puppet Ustasha regime in World War II, and critics say some of his fans have given the Nazi salute and worn black T-shirts and caps styled after the uniforms of the puppet regime. Mark Weitzman, a spokesman for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, said that while some of Mr. Perkovic’s songs have a “positive message of patriotism and peace,” there is “also an element that appears to glorify the regime that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II and that was responsible for thousands and thousands of deaths of Jews, Serbs and other Croats.” Similar criticism came from Nenad Milinkovic, president of the board of a Serbian-American church in Manhattan. Mr. Perkovic, 42, said his performances had been misinterpreted. “I’m a musician, not a politician,” he said in June after a concert for 50,000 fans in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. “At my concerts I sing about love, God and the homeland — only about that and nothing else.” Mr. Weitzman urged Cardinal Edward M. Egan, the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, to cancel the concerts, at a cultural center operated by the Croatian Church of St. Cyril & Methodius, at 10th Avenue and 41st Street. Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said church officials were investigating but had found nothing to substantiate the accusations. Mr. Perkovic’s tour is to take him to Toronto; Cleveland; Chicago; Los Angeles; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Jose, Calif.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/arts/music/01arts-1-CROATIANROCK_BRF.html

2007-11-02,A Reader’s Obligations,"Thursday night, with Sam’s strongly-voiced, fair-minded support of Mr. Pevear and Ms. Volokhonsky’s translation of “War and Peace” much on my mind, I sat in an auditorium at the Morgan Library, listening to the new curator of literary and historical manuscripts, Declan Kiely, speak on some of the gems in the library’s collection. One of these was a handwritten draft of a broadcast E.M. Forster delivered on the BBC Radio’s Far Eastern Service in 1943, about Marcel Proust and “The Remembrance of Things Past.”* In the broadcast, Forster argued that “Remembrance” was the second greatest novel in European literature (“War and Peace” being the first, though he scants it in the essay); and that, as such, readers needed to understand better how to read Proust to get from him what they should. “Be patient with him,” Forster urged. “He does not go with a swing, and only gradually draws you into his mesh. And be intelligent. It is so easy to read books stupidly, not with our full powers, and Proust makes no concessions to stupidity. Some writers — and they are great writers — do make concessions. Dickens does, for instance, and even Tolstoy does. Proust doesn’t. He expects a constant awareness, both from the mind and from the senses.”",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/a-readers-obligations/

The males, called drones, die after mating or are driven out of the colony by the females and die of exposure; they are not worked to death. (The females do the work.) The life span of the males can range from two or three weeks to nearly two months or more; their life span is not always limited to 30 days. The number of males in a colony can be in the hundreds or more; a colony is not limited to 100. At the height of the nectar-gathering season, colonies can include 50,000 bees or more; thus a queen can be attended by more than 30,000 subjects, not just 30,000.

Published nearly a decade after “Mason & Dixon,” “Against the Day” is Pynchon’s longest (at 1,085 pages) and, our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, said, his funniest and most accessible novel. The complex plot unspools during the years from 1893 to the 1920s; one of its strands is the attempt by three brothers to avenge their father’s murder by agents of the plutocracy. Along the way there are dazzling set pieces, Dickensian characters, torrents of words and Pynchon’s signature puns. “Against the Day” proves Pynchon the heir to H. G.

For unlike Cinderella, whose foot found its ideal glass slipper, or Goldilocks, with her just-right porridge and lodgings, this heroine never discovered a flawless fit. Instead, her Platonic ideal of Frenchness eluded her at every turn. Étienne confessed that he spoke Catalan at home. Bernard, a native of Brittany, grumbled that construing him as a model Français was not unlike describing an Irishman as English. Ever since the Dreyfus Affair had exposed his compatriots’ anti-Semitism in the late 19th century, Léon explained, his family had viewed itself as Jewish first, French second. François, a haughty aristocrat, informed her that in the 15th century, his ancestors had fought with the Burgundians ... against the French.

In the artist Iván Navarro’s rendition of the chair, the frame is made from three neon tubes in a glowing shade of disco-era purple. Navarro’s “Red and Blue Electric Chair” is another Modernist remake, this one in the image of Gerrit Rietveld’s Red and Blue Chair from 1918. “It was kind of a building block for me,” Navarro says of the fluorescent piece, an exercise in materials and formalism. Unlike the Bauhaus approach to chairs as “machines for sitting,” Navarro’s artwork is not for sitting at all, and he would be more apt to refer to his chairs as machines for killing. “Neon is fragile,” he says, “but it can electrocute you.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/magazine/04style-matter-t.html

In many ways, this link between the genocide of the Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and the genocide of the Jews by the Nazis from 1941 to 1945 brings together the elements of Alan Kramer’s important book, “Dynamic of Destruction: Culture and Mass Killing in the First World War.” Kramer believes that the two world wars may be regarded as a single four-decade trauma, and he argues that World War I was considerably more than simply a new industrial form of warfare that brutalized the modern world.

I. Lonoff. “The dirt-seeking snooping calling itself research is just about the lowest of literary rackets,” Zuckerman tells Kliman. “You’re going to redeem Lonoff’s reputation as a writer by ruining it as a man.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/Donadio-t.html

2007-11-05,The Story Behind the Story Within the Story,"THE big set piece at the heart of “Atonement” takes place on the beach at Dunkirk during the British evacuation in 1940. Dazed and exhausted, a wounded soldier named Robbie Turner stumbles onto the beach along with two sidekicks while a six-minute tracking shot establishes a montage of eerie, almost surreal images: a bandstand, abandoned cannons, a choir in rehearsal, an enormous beached boat, wandering circus horses, a Ferris wheel turning idly against a smoke-streaked sky. A little later Robbie takes refuge in a movie house where “Quai des Brumes,” a noirish Jean Gabin picture from 1938, is playing. He wanders across the screen, passing in front of a close-up of Gabin, and for a moment it looks as if he’s standing in your theater, not the one in France.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/movies/moviesspecial/04mcgr.html

2007-11-05,Town Without Pity,"Someone — it’s been attributed to everyone from Dostoyevsky to John Gardner — once said there are only two possible stories: a man goes on a journey, or a stranger comes to town. To these Richard Russo has added a third: schlub stays put. In a time known in trendier circles for literary exile, Russo is the unofficial poet laureate of uneasy stasis, of fixing yourself to the place where you were born. Out the window goes the dynamism of American self-invention; in comes something almost more mysterious: a reckoning with an apparently seamless life continuity. If I didn’t invent this self, where exactly did it come from? And yet more queasily: This place that nurtured me — did it also stunt me, inhibit me, even, literally, poison me?

2007-11-05,The Turning of an Atheist," Unless you are a professional philosopher or a committed atheist, you probably have not heard of Antony Flew. Eighty-four years old and long retired, Flew lives with his wife in Reading, a medium-size town on the Thames an hour west of London. Over a long career he held appointments at a series of decent regional universities — Aberdeen, Keele, Reading — and earned a strong reputation writing on an unusual range of topics, from Hume to immortality to Darwin. His greatest contribution remains his first, a short paper from 1950 called “Theology and Falsification.” Flew was a precocious 27 when he delivered the paper at a meeting of the Socratic Club, the Oxford salon presided over by C. S. Lewis. Reprinted in dozens of anthologies, “Theology and Falsification” has become a heroic tract for committed atheists. In a masterfully terse thousand words, Flew argues that “God” is too vague a concept to be meaningful. For if God’s greatness entails being invisible, intangible and inscrutable, then he can’t be disproved — but nor can he be proved. Such powerful but simply stated arguments made Flew popular on the campus speaking circuit; videos from debates in the 1970s show a lanky man, his black hair professorially unkempt, vivisecting religious belief with an English public-school accent perfect for the seduction of American ears. Before the current crop of atheist crusader-authors — Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens — there was Antony Flew.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/magazine/04Flew-t.html

I suppose I expected a poorly written racist tract.” But Carter, whose own best-selling novels “New England White” and “The Emperor of Ocean Park” suggest he knows something about combining literary entertainment and penetrating observation about race in America, found his assumptions upended. “I was staggered by the power of Margaret Mitchell’s imagination and the clean beauty of her prose,” he wrote. “Her characters are irresistible.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/Upfront-t.html

2007-11-05,Mr. Geniality,"The elements of this collection fully justify the rather modest promise offered by the title. All things are indeed considered, and they are mostly considered in a highly considerate manner. As to the “due” part, John Updike himself informs us: “Bills come due; dues must be paid. After eight years, I was due for another collection of nonfictional prose.” To which one might add that he seems determined to give everyone his or her due. Indeed, in a highly affable preface he wonders if his only fault might be a tendency to be critical — in the ordinary sense of the term — at all. Rereading his book reviews, he wonders aloud “if their customary geniality, almost effusive in the presence of a foreign writer or a factual topic, didn’t somewhat sour when faced with a novel by a fellow-countryman.” Should he perhaps have been a little kinder to E. L. Doctorow, Don DeLillo and Norman Rush or (by implication) a fraction more harsh with Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Haruki Murakami?

2007-11-05,Inside the List,"WHY I AM A RICH WRITER: Ken Follett — his new novel, “World Without End,” is No. 3 on the fiction list — is yet another popular novelist who, to his credit, makes a habit of correcting the errors that creep into his books. Follett is good-natured and witty about his mistakes, even if others sometimes are not. On his Web site, for example, he writes about the following misstep, from his novel “The Hammer of Eden”: “One of the F.B.I. agents is a Hindu called Raja Khan. Raja is a popular Hindu name, but Khan is a typical Muslim name. Some of my readers suffer a sense-of-humor lapse about this error.” Follett was the subject of a profile recently in USA Today in which he recounted this conversation with a friend, the novelist and playwright Hanif Kureishi: “We were talking about what the readers like,” Follett said. “He said, ‘I never think about the readers.’ I told him, ‘That’s why you are a great writer, and that’s why I am a rich writer.’”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/04tbr.html

2007-11-05,"Performa 07: Adam Pendleton, Artists and Statistics","My first Performa outing, to Adam Pendleton’s “The Revival,” on Thursday night, was a pretty impressive experience. The setting was the cavernous, immaculate space of the Stephan Weiss studio in Greenwich Village (what did the sculptor do with all that space?), outfitted with benches in a slight fan shape around the stage – and it was packed with fashionable Performa people, some standing near the back. The back was where Mr. Pendleton emerged from, but first his disembodied golden voice floated over the crowd, and over the choir and musicians on the stage. With a mixture of oratory, poetry, politico-speak and strident gay protest, he held sway for just on an hour, alternating his resonant, often repetitive text with the choir’s gorgeous sonorities.I had my reservations about the text – for one, the section where Mr. Pendleton quotes Aids statistics and talks about the Bush Administration’s responses to HIV infection felt like an obligatory gay rights insert rather than integral to the piece. But the man is the most charismatic performer I’ve seen on stage for a long time – and the acoustics at the studio were extraordinary – for once, the meaning of “crystal clear” seemed appropriate: you could hear everything from a whisper to the full-throated roar of the choir with utter purity.It was also an extraordinarily polished and well-paced show, from the grave processional entrance of the choir to their departure and Mr. Pendleton’s final monologue and slow exit – out back, the way he had come in. But despite that, there was a relaxed enjoyment of performance and involvement amongst the choir that was a pleasure to see. And their singing really did communicate the uplifting joyousness of that religious tradition without quite speaking directly of religion.But quite aside from the piece itself, what struck me strongly was that it was the second time in one week that a performer was up there on stage quoting statistics about life in America to an audience. In his wonderful new work, “Misuse Liable to Prosecution,” the choreographer John Jasperse offers the audience numbers about the war, the arts, the salaries of various figures, and the costs of his production. Adam Pendleton does something similar in his Aids section. Are artists feeling that things are so bad that their art forms – poetry, the dancing body in these cases – are too inchoate for what they need to say? Perhaps it was a coincidence, but I suspect not.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/performa-07-adam-pendleton-artists-and-statistics/

Each day, hundreds of visitors file through his tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor, carrying with them bacteria, humidity and pollutants. “The mummy risked being reduced to dust because of the rising levels of humidity due to the visitors,” Mr. Hawass said. Rejecting a popular theory that Tut died of a blow to the neck at 19, Egyptian, Swiss and Italian experts have deduced that he did die at 19, after a 10-year reign, but that the cause was an injury to his left leg, which then turned gangrenous. When Tut’s tomb was discovered, his embalmed body was encased in three sarcophagi, one of them solid gold, and his face lay beneath a 24-pound solid-gold burial mask encrusted with lapis lazuli and other semiprecious stones. The latest in the popular King Tut exhibitions is to open in London this month and will return to the United States next year.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/arts/05arts-TUTFACESHISP_BRF.html

2007-11-06,Amazing Race Is Off to a Flying Start,"The 12th edition of “The Amazing Race” got under way to solid ratings on Sunday, as CBS attracted the night’s most viewers over all. The network led its competitors by a significant margin going into prime time, thanks to an overrun of its afternoon football coverage. That highly anticipated match-up of undefeated teams, the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, delivered more than 32 million viewers in its final half-hour, according to Nielsen’s preliminary estimates. Although that audience largely dissipated once the game ended around 7:30 p.m., 18.8 million viewers stuck around for CBS’s “60 Minutes,” and 13.8 million tuned in for CBS’s “Amazing Race” after that, the most ever for a first episode of the contest. For the night, NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” edged past CBS for first place among adults 18 to 49, while ABC had a rare third-place finish, despite leading the 9 p.m. hour with “Desperate Housewives” (18.5 million). Fox ranked fourth over all. The 100th episode of Fox’s “Family Guy” drew 10.5 million viewers at 9, while the annual Halloween episode of “The Simpsons” (11.7 million) led its 8 o’clock slot in the 18-to-49 set.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/arts/television/06arts-AMAZINGRACEI_BRF.html

2007-11-08,Polanski to Film the Ghost,"Roman Polanski has signed on to direct a film adaptation of “The Ghost,” a political thriller written by Robert Harris and published last month in the United States by Simon & Schuster. The novel is narrated by a ghostwriter for a former British prime minister, Adam Lang, who is writing his memoirs. Lang recently stepped down after a sharp slide in popularity because of his support for an American-led war, and his first collaborator has mysteriously died. In an interview, Mr. Polanski, who lives in France and had been working with Mr. Harris on a film adaptation of Mr. Harris’s novel “Pompeii,” said he read “The Ghost” and knew right away that he wanted to turn it into a film. “A political thriller is exactly what I wanted,” said Mr. Polanski, the director of “Chinatown” and “Rosemary’s Baby,” who won an Oscar for “The Pianist” in 2003. “I like books that I can’t put down, and at the same time it’s a kind of satire on certain political situations with which we are only too well acquainted.” A large portion of “The Ghost” takes place on Martha’s Vineyard; Mr. Polanski won’t be able to film there because he has remained a fugitive since fleeing the United States in 1978 to avoid prison after pleading guilty to statutory rape. “It doesn’t really matter where you do it,” Mr. Polanski said, referring to filming “The Ghost,” which he hopes to begin next fall. “It just has to be somewhere on the Atlantic off season where you have dunes and empty roads and unlived-in holiday houses.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/arts/08arts-POLANSKITOFI_BRF.html

2007-11-09,Uncorking One Family’s Secret,"Graham Swift’s lugubrious new novel, “Tomorrow,” is told in the voice of an Englishwoman named Paula Hook silently addressing her children. Unable to sleep, Paula worries about what is going to happen the next morning: She and her husband, Mike, have decided that tomorrow is “Doomsday” or “Bombshell Day,” the day they are going to tell their 16-year-old twins, Kate and Nick, a family secret that “will change all our lives.” Mike and Paula have dreaded this moment for years: Earlier this evening they planned a “terminal supper,” and “made love in a special, a poignant, a farewell way.” As the narrator sees it, the ordeal to come is her husband’s “real moment of judgment,” and she tells her children that they will be in a position to “decide in his favor” or not. She says she has no idea how Nick and Kate will react to his news: “I picture a bomb going off and this house falling to bits. I picture everything remaining oddly, precariously, ominously the same. An unexploded bomb. It still might go off — next week, the week after, any time.” The big secret, which seems pretty obvious to the attentive reader early on, is revealed about halfway through the novel — and this is fair warning to readers who would prefer not to know: that Mike is not the twins’ biological father, that they were conceived by artificial insemination, using an anonymous donor’s sperm.

The ruling on Thursday was in response to motions filed by a group seeking to stop this financially troubled school from selling the works to increase its endowment. The paintings, including “Men of the Docks” (1912), below, by George Bellows, were to be sold through Christie’s this month in New York, for an estimated $25 million to $35 million. Judge J. Leyburn Mosby Jr. of the Lynchburg Circuit Court found that “the harm if the art is sold is greater than the harm if the art is not sold.” The injunction is to take effect once the opponents to the sale post a $10 million bond. The college, in Lynchburg, will appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court and hopes to have the decision reversed before the first auction on Nov. 19, a college spokeswoman said. Another motion previously filed by Randolph College asks the circuit court to determine whether the school can legally sell or share 36 pieces of art bought from a trust bequeathed by a former professor.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/arts/design/10arts-COLLEGEARTSA_BRF.html

2007-11-12,Daniel Day-Lewis’s All-Time Top Westerns,"I don't particularly like westerns as a genre, but I do love certain westerns. ''High Noon'' means a lot to me - I love the purity and the honesty, I love Gary Cooper in that film, the idea of the last man standing. I do not like John Wayne: I find it hard to watch him. I just never took to him. And I don't like Jimmy Stewart as a cowboy. I love him, but just not as a cowboy; ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' is one of my favorite films. I love Capra. I love Preston Sturges. But we're talking about westerns. ... I have always admired Clint Eastwood's westerns. The spaghetti westerns were a great discovery. And ''Pale Rider.'' As a child, the John Ford film ''Cheyenne Autumn'' made a big impression on me. And ''Five Easy Pieces.'' It's not really a western, but it is about the possibilities that can be found in the West. Jack Nicholson is sublime in that film, just sublime. It's the most stultifying portrait of middle-class life. You want to flee from that world and head anywhere less civilized. Which is, of course, the appeal of the West: It's not tamed yet. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11daylewislist.html

Harbaugh is the Cardinal’s fiery first-year coach and a longtime N.F.L. quarterback. He replaced the bookish Walt Harris. (Harris always made it a point to say that he bought The New York Times on Tuesdays to read the Science Times section.) Harbaugh often tells his players to “approach this day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.” He won them over, in part, by running wind sprints with them and jumping in to quarterback some two-minute drills in practice. He won over the country by beating top-ranked U.S.C. as a 41-point underdog. Now can he win over recruits? Here’s the always free-spirited Harbaugh talking about growing up in a football family, Stanford’s limited recruiting pool and why his coordinators get free houses.

Bowlsby knows this, of course, because Palo Alto is the most expensive, with the average price of a 4-bedroom, 2,200 square-foot house being $1.67 million. This led to Stanford beginning an innovative new program where they actually buy houses for their football team coordinators to live in and give the assistant coaches a $3,000 per month housing stipend. That would buy a mansion in Muncie, Ind., the home of Ball State and the least expensive university town. A 4-bedroom house there costs an average of $150,000.

Chief among these were William and Ceil Baring-Gould, who in “The Annotated Mother Goose” (1962), asserted connections between famous people and such characters as Jack Horner and Miss Muffet; the spider who sat down beside her, incidentally, was said to be the Protestant reformer John Knox. Equally quotidian was Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, whose humorless disapproval of Mother Goose in 1952 appears in his census of crimes to be found therein: under “means of murder,” for example, two cases of choking and one each of devouring, being cut in half, decapitation, squeezing, shriveling, starvation, boiling, hanging and drowning.

2007-11-12,The Colossus,"John Richardson’s writing is tremendously satisfying, at once easygoing and magisterial. In the third, penultimate installment of his life of Picasso, Richardson is juggling so many people and themes and events with such aplomb that readers may not quite realize what literary pyrotechnics are involved. This powerhouse of a book spans a dauntingly complicated time in Picasso’s life and in European history as well, taking us from World War I and Picasso’s adventures with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes to the riotously erotic images of Picasso’s youthful mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, and the darkening situation of the early 1930s. Richardson obviously delights in a life that in this account takes on some of the bewildering complexity of a three-ring circus. And why not? Picasso himself often chose to refract his experiences through the world of clowns and jugglers and gymnasts, whether in the melancholy portraits of saltimbanques that absorbed him in the first years of the 20th century or in the long series of etchings, with their densely plotted, sometimes wildly comic dream-narratives, that are a commanding achievement of the years leading up to his death in 1973 at the age of 91.

Baldwin encouraged Styron in his latest project, “The Confessions of Nat Turner.” When the novel was published in 1967, it met with acclaim from mostly white mainstream critics. But many blacks were outraged. They accused Styron of distorting history, of appropriating a black man’s voice and using it to perpetuate racist stereotypes. They organized a boycott of the book.

The first transition of this phase is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 31, which will require all citizens of the United States traveling by land and sea to present a government-issued photo identification card, like a driver’s license, along with proof of citizenship, like a birth certificate, at the border.

Yet as he lies in his hospital cot, slurping soup and leering at an African nun (how could he resist, since her sensuality projects “the energy of an Olatunji drum solo, of a gnu trampling through the rain forest”), he’s able to transcend his physical pain and ponder the transmigration of bouillon: “It was beef soup; it tasted of eternal life and of the fact that all living beings consume one another.” There hasn’t been a day in 20 years when Kasper hasn’t longed to “give up,” to leave Copenhagen for good — to “withdraw his savings. Take off for the Fiji Islands. Develop an opium habit. Listen to cello sonatas on the stereo and fade out on the beach.” You have to wonder what stopped him.

In fact, he was rather more complicated — a civilized, upper-class Jewish émigré from Vienna, son of Emperor Franz Josef’s chief legal defender; a political liberal; a man capable of courtly kindness and generosity to favored colleagues; a shrewd showman with a genius for manipulating the press; a producer who in the 1950s became one of the first great masters of independent (as opposed to studio system) production; and, finally, a cinematic stylist with a unique, if sometimes limiting, manner.

The answers we came up with were not particularly surprising. Dissatisfied with contemporary political leaders, many looked back with longing to a time when giants seemed to walk the earth; in those pre-9/11, pre-Iraq days, too, the stakes of the Revolutionary generation’s struggles seemed epic compared with the squabbles of our own time.

2007-11-12,How the Western Was Won,"LIKE A GUNSLINGER standing on a dusty street in a one-horse town, facing down a posse or, if he’s wearing a tin star, a gang of outlaws, the western has proved hard to kill. Officially, of course, its death has been documented again and again, with regret and, sometimes, with satisfaction. But as soon as the obsequies have been pronounced and the coffin lowered into the sandy earth, the rumble of hoofbeats sounds on the horizon, and the western rides again. In 1991, for example, the critic J. Hoberman published a thorough and persuasive essay called “How the Western Was Lost,” documenting the waning of a once-vigorous form. That same year, however, Kevin Costner’s “Dances With Wolves” won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, a feat Clint Eastwood’s “Unforgiven” would match two years later. But Hoberman surely had a point. The movie western had retreated from its position as a quintessential and vital form of American storytelling, undone by the same cultural tumult that had put paid to other manifestations of midcentury consensus. The newer westerns, the ones made since Vietnam, were either revivalist or revisionist, seeking to bury the old myths or to exhume them.

In the midst of her spree of bloodletting, she obliquely alludes to her activities on the air, and quotes from D. H. Lawrence’s “Studies in Classic American Literature”: “The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” Whatever Lawrence’s own political predilections, that line (he was thinking of James Fenimore Cooper’s “Deerslayer”) has the oddest of fan bases, making bedfellows of two gangs who, you might think, wouldn’t otherwise be caught dead in the same room: European romantics and American right-wing ideologues.

She also recruited the three judges who sifted through hundreds of illustrated books in search of the 10 Best (the winners appear here). As was the case last year, a strong selection of young adult novels shares the stage with the season’s outstanding picture books — including first ventures into the field by writers like Peter Cameron, Nick Hornby and Sherman Alexie, whose autobiographical novel is a finalist for the National Book Award for young people’s literature.

Theroux delivers richer prose than Michener, subtler insights and slyer dilemmas, but he resembles the late mass-market master of narrative geography by treating societies as his true protagonists while giving his characters (in his novels, at least) the auxiliary role of inciting, observing or acting out the conflicts latent in their surrounding cultures. Art for art’s sake isn’t Theroux’s bag, and it needn’t be, of course.

2007-11-12,The New Frontier’s Man,"IN 1976, WHEN HE WAS 19, Daniel Day-Lewis, who is British and was trained in the grand theatrical tradition of Shakespeare and the classics, saw “Taxi Driver” and, despite the considerable weight and seeming obligation of his heritage, realized that what he longed to be was an American actor. “It was a real illumination,” Day-Lewis told me late in August as he sat at the rough wood dining table of a duplex apartment in downtown Manhattan, where he and his wife, Rebecca Miller, and their two boys stay when in New York. “I saw ‘Taxi Driver’ five or six times in the first week, and I was astonished by its sheer visceral beauty. I just kept going back — I didn’t know America, but that was a glimpse of what America might be, and I realized that, contrary to expectation, I wanted to tell American stories.” It was raining hard outside, and Day-Lewis, who has the look of an elegant vagabond, was wearing clothes seemingly chosen many years ago for their utility and subtle details. His loose denim jeans were worn soft and white by use and the once-vibrant red plaid of his shirt had aged into a warm maroon. Day-Lewis is tall and lean and has tattoos circling his lower arms and the permanently inked handprints of his and Miller’s two sons climbing up his body to his shoulders. There were gold loops in each earlobe, and although he had left his sturdy, beat-up leather work boots outside the front door and was padding around in his socks, Day-Lewis still had a kind-of-jaunty porkpie hat on his head. The hat covered his long black hair and set off the contours of his face, which is dominated by his noble, bashed nose.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/magazine/11daylewis-t2.html

2007-11-12,Paperback Row,"NIXON AND KISSINGER: Partners in Power, by Robert Dallek. (HarperCollins, $18.95.) Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser and, later, secretary of state, were simultaneously visionaries and cynics, according to the historian Robert Dallek (pictured below). Both were ruthless pragmatists and insecure loners who distrusted and abused those around them, including each other. Their partnership produced bold foreign policy advances like the opening of relations with China in 1971-72, but also prolonged and expanded the Vietnam War and overthrew the democratically elected government of Chile. Relying on recently declassified material, including thousands of pages of transcriptions of Kissinger’s phone calls, Dallek argues that the careers of both men “reflect the extent to which great accomplishments and public wrongdoing can spring from inner lives.” Another secretary of state with a complicated relationship to his president is the subject of SOLDIER: The Life of Colin Powell (Vintage, $17.95), by the Washington Post editor Karen DeYoung. Her presentation of Powell’s early career draws heavily on his 1995 memoir; six long interviews with Powell inform DeYoung’s sympathetic account of his contribution to the Bush administration’s case for war. DeYoung sees Powell’s willingness to promote a policy he questioned as rooted in his habitual caution and his view of his duty: “His job was to serve the president, not to undermine him,” Michael Lewis explained in the Book Review.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

Benson, right) and Renée Zellweger, took in $26 million, while “American Gangster,” starring Denzel Washington as a drug lord and Russell Crowe as his law enforcement nemesis, grossed $24.3 million, according to estimates from the tracking company Media by Numbers. “We don’t often see a movie start out in the No. 2 position then move up to No. 1,” Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Media by Numbers, told The Associated Press. “It just shows how strong the word of mouth is on this movie and that families are really enjoying it.” Third and fourth places went to two newcomers. “Fred Claus” (Warner Brothers), the comedy starring Vince Vaughn as the disgruntled elder brother of Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), took in $19.2 million. Robert Redford’s current-affairs drama, “Lions for Lambs” (MGM), with Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep, gathered $6.7 million.

2007-11-12,Berlin in Lights: Flamboyance Jostles Solemnity Aside,"With my colleague Tony Tommasini having handled the critical end of things, here are some random observations about last night’s concert by Gustavo Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Dudamel’s many musical gifts aside, he manages to project a good-natured sincerity, an earnestness that seems entirely genuine. When Emanuel Ax, the soloist, played an encore, Mr. Dudamel sat down right in the string section and listened. When he took his bows, he did so off the podium, shoulder to shoulder with the string players, his arm draped over a cellist.***The orchestra players did their signature act, donning jackets with the Venezuelan colors (red, yellow and blue) after a solemn and grandiose Beethoven Fifth Symphony and generally turning into the definition of flamboyance — spinning instruments, standing up and jiving, shimmying, pointing their horns into the air — for the Latin-inflected part of the program. But the same kind of physical enthusiasm, not choreographed and not premeditated, was evident in the Beethoven, where the first violins rocked back and forth together, almost synchronized. For those who missed the concert, the unbridled Latin act – totally infectious – can be seen in several previous versions on YouTube, most prominently from a London Proms concert.***Venezuelan pride was not just on the stage. Several audience members hung the nation’s flag over the rail of the first balcony and waved it during applause.***On the group’s big night at Carnegie, a mishap hit the viola section. A string appeared to break on a first-stand instrument during the first movement of the Beethoven. The players passed it back to the tail end of the section. A last-stand violist passed a replacement instrument forward and changed strings on the viola that had come down the line. Ah, the unexpected nature of live acoustical performance.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/berlin-in-lights-flamboyance-jostles-solemnity-aside/

As previously reported, the band will sell the album in an arrangement with ATO Records and a related spinoff label, TBD Records. Representatives of the band, which is fronted by Thom Yorke, above, said yesterday that ATO planned to seek radio airplay for two of the album’s songs, “Bodysnatchers” and “Jigsaw Falling Into Place.” Questions about the prospects for selling a CD version of “In Rainbows” have lingered since the band let fans name their own price — even nothing — for downloading the album from a Radiohead Web site, inrainbows.com. So far, the band has declined to detail how many copies were distributed, or for what price, and has disputed a recent outside study suggesting that more than a million copies were downloaded.

So far confined to Canada, it is characterized by angry outbursts in bookstores and, more specifically, by the hurling of books, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The causes: the declining United States dollar, the rising Canadian dollar and dust jackets imprinted with prices making books more costly for Canadians. For more than 30 years the value of the Canadian dollar has lagged that of its American cousin; five years ago it was worth 62 American cents. As a result, book jackets customarily show a United States price and a higher Canadian price. But last week the Canadian dollar hit $1.10 against the United States dollar; yesterday it stood at $1.03. Thus book rage and widespread reports of unhappiness among buyers expected to pay the higher price. Some Canadian booksellers, including Wal-Mart Canada, have begun to offer their wares at United States prices; others are giving discounts on the Canadian price, rebates or simply marking down the books.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/arts/13arts-OPENBOOKSEER_BRF.html

2007-11-14,Who Are You Also Known As?,"Like many adopted people I never had a simple answer to the question, ""Where did I come from?"" For most people raised by their biological parents, this question can be answered by simply gazing at their parent's face. There in the turn of a nose and the curve of the eye they are reminded of where they came from. bounded by blood, a part of a human continuum passed from mother to daughter, from father to son.   (Photo: The author, the day she arrived in the United States, walking off the plane at J.F.K. airport. (Photographs courtesy of Hollee McGinnis.)) I, on the other hand, seemingly dropped out of the sky on a Boeing 747, walking, talking and potty trained. I was adopted in May 1975 at the age of 3 ½ with just the clothes on my back: a little red pant suit and vest, and white sweater trimmed in red. I have no memories of that day I arrived in America – but I have been told stories so many times that I feel like I remember: running up and down the escalators of John F. Kennedy airport after being cooped up in an airplane for 28 hours; my parents giving me lollipops because I was too big for a pacifier to quiet me on the ride to my new home in the suburbs of New York City; and pushing the Uncle Ben's white rice on the floor the first morning and eating the Entenmanns's coffee cakes instead.  My parents told me that summer of my arrival I would sing and talk in Korean. Of course they never knew what I was saying. They also told me that in those first weeks I would run up to the front door, throw my body up against it and cry and cry and say in Korean, ""Jip e ka le!"" My sister, born to my parents and age 9 at the time, thought it might be some strange Korean game. So she would run up to the door, throw her body against it and say, ""Jip e ka le!"" I can imagine my sister doing this over and over – and turning my tears into laughter. Years later my parents learned what my Korean words meant: I want to go home.   (Photo: The author, front row lower left in the red outfit at the orphanage on Tok Chok Island founded by the Maryknoll priest, Ben Zweber (center).)   This illustrates two things: first, that no matter how old a child is when adopted – whether as an infant, a toddler, or young child – they come with a history, a past that is real. Secondly, it illustrates that when we adopt, there is movement. There is a movement from one place to another, from one culture to another, from one family to another, and in these movements there are both losses and gains. The only way a child gains a family through adoption is by losing another family in some way. This paradoxical nature of adoption raises serious questions that need to be resolved: What are adoption gains and losses? And do the gains outweigh the losses?   Growing up, I was not aware of the losses in adoption, just the gains: parents and siblings and friends who loved me. Like many adopted people who have the fortune of being raised in a supportive home, I did not think much about the fact of my adoption. I thought of my adoption as one thinks about breathing – it was simply part of who I was. I was not necessarily conscious of it as a child growing up unless someone pointed it out to me. And I certainly did not feel like there was anything ""wrong"" because I was adopted. I grew up knowing very clearly who I was: I was Hollee.   My personal awakening to the losses of adoption began in my late adolescence when I became aware that strangers assumed I was not an American because I did not have blond hair and blue eyes or assumed I spoke Korean (or Chinese or Japanese) or complimented me on my English. I, on the other hand, did not think of myself as Korean – although I felt pride that I was — because I was raised by a non-Korean family. I felt like an imposter because people assumed I knew Korean culture based on my race, but I only knew American culture.   Thus, in my first year of college I sought to fulfill the stereotypes and assumptions people had of me based on my race. I studied Mandarin – because my college did not offer Korean at that time – and took classes in Asian art and history. But it angered me that people would make assumptions about who I was based on things I could not change: my gender, my race, my adoption status – and judge me not for the individual I was. And so in my sophomore year I changed my major to American studies because I wanted to understand how I, as an Asian woman with an Irish last name and blond-haired mother, could be an American too.   Ultimately I realized this conflict about my identity arose because I felt I had only two choices: Korean or American. The reality was that I was both. I felt to identify simply as being Asian would be to deny the love and nurture of my adoptive parents; and to identify solely as American, I would be denying my Korean ancestry and heritage. When I began to embrace both identities rather than trying to ""fit in"" I realized the gains in my life that came from this duality. I realized, ""Well, hey, not everyone gets to be adopted internationally and have two countries and two families.""   Learning about the history of intercountry adoptions, I knew I was not the only person who might feel caught between these two worlds. In fact, I was inspired by the fact that there was such a large community of adult international adoptees – an estimated quarter million in the United States — who could share their experiences, especially with the younger generation of families being formed through intercountry adoption. I felt that as a community we could truly create a space in which we could explore, and come to embrace and celebrate our dual heritages given to us by birth and adoption.   Thus, two years after college at the age of 24 I started a non-profit organization for adult intercountry adoptees in New York City — Also-Known-As. The goal of the organization was and is to share the unique experiences and identity of intercountry adoptees and their families and to celebrate the broader transcultural community. The organization works to empower those who have been adopted internationally by providing mentorship to adopted youth, building cultural bridges through awareness and appreciation of one's birth culture, and transforming racial stereotypes.   In accepting my identity as an international transracial adoptee, and rejecting the identities imposed upon me, I realized the question, ""Who am I?"" can only be answered by my declaration ""Who I am.""   Who I am is a transcultural, multicultural, interracial, hybrid, bridging worlds, being. I am Hollee McGinnis also-known-as Lee Hwa Yeong. I have an Asian face, an Irish last name, a blond-haired mother.   But who I am is not just about who I know myself to be, but who I want to also be known as in this world. At its best, intercountry adoption demonstrates to me the greatness of our human spirits to love across race, nationality and culture. But I also know that it takes a lot more than just love to make a success; – it requires courage, honesty, and commitment.   This means we must be willing to talk about the hard stuff – the discrimination, inequalities, and prejudices that exist in the world. We must also be willing to change and challenge our societies so that the gift we give our children – adopted or not – besides the love and security of a permanent family is a world that values them for who they are and who they will be – regardless of race, nationality, culture or circumstance.

Mr. Meehan said, “Sylvester Stallone won’t be in it, but he’s given us his blessing.” Ms. Ahrens said the project was in its “exploratory” stage, adding, “I really think it’s premature to discuss anything about it.”... “Little House on the Prairie,” a musical based on the “Little House” children’s novels by Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867-1957), will have its premiere next year at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, The Associated Press reported. Joe Dowling, artistic director of the Guthrie, said the show would be directed by Francesca Zambello, who brought the property to his attention. The book is being written by Rachel Sheinkin, who won a 2005 Tony Award for best book of a musical for “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” The “Little House” books draw from the 1870s and ’80s, when Wilder was growing up as a member of the Ingalls family in Wisconsin, Kansas, Minnesota and South Dakota.

He said yesterday that he is returning to his hometown, Seattle, to be near his 13-year-old daughter, whose wistful voice-mail message he played in making the announcement. In an interview, Jay Kernis, NPR’s senior vice president for programming, said, “I think it was just too difficult a situation” for Mr. Burbank to be a long-distance dad. While the show is sorry to lose Mr. Burbank, Mr. Kernis said, “if we thought we couldn’t do it without him, we wouldn’t have released him” from his contract. NPR budgeted $2 million for the start-up of this New York-based program, which was more than a year in development and has a conversational style intended to appeal to a younger audience than traditionally tunes in to NPR. Audience reaction has been mixed. Visits to the program’s Web site have grown markedly, but listeners to Salt Lake City’s KCPW, which precedes the popular “Morning Edition” with the new program, complained that it isn’t substantive enough and some have said they will withdraw financial support. Mr. Kernis said that NPR hoped to have a replacement join the co-host, Alison Stewart, by the time Mr. Burbank leaves in mid-December.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/arts/14arts-COHOSTQUITSN_BRF.html

2007-11-14,‘Gomorrah’,"The container swayed as the crane hoisted it onto the ship. The spreader, which hooks the container to the crane, was unable to control its movement, so it seemed to float in the air. The hatches, which had been improperly closed, suddenly sprang open, and dozens of bodies started raining down. They looked like mannequins. But when they hit the ground, their heads split open, as if their skulls were real. And they were. Men, women, even a few children, came tumbling out of the container. All dead. Frozen, stacked one on top of another, packed like sardines. These were the Chinese who never die. The eternal ones, who trade identity papers among themselves. So this is where they'd ended up, the bodies that in the wildest fantasies might have been cooked in Chinese restaurants, buried in fields beside factories, or tossed into the mouth of Vesuvius. Here they were. Spilling from the container by the dozen, their names scribbled on tags and tied with string around their necks. They'd all put aside money so they could be buried in China, back in their hometowns, a percentage withheld from their salaries to guarantee their return voyage once they were dead. A space in a container and a hole in some strip of Chinese soil. The port crane operator covered his face with his hands as he told me about it, eyeing me through his fingers. As if the mask of his hands might give him the courage to speak. He'd seen the bodies fall, but there'd been no need to sound the alarm. He merely lowered the container to the ground, and dozens of people appeared out of nowhere to put everyone back inside and hose down the remains. That's how it went. He still couldn't believe it and hoped he was hallucinating, due to too much overtime. Then he closed his fingers, completely covering his eyes. He kept on whimpering, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/books/1st-chapter-gom.html

News of the canceled New York tapings, first reported yesterday on the Web site DeadlineHollywoodDaily.com, was confirmed by representatives of Ms. DeGeneres’s production company, Telepictures. Ms. DeGeneres returned to her syndicated daily talk show last week after sitting out just one day of the strike. That decision drew strong protests from the Writers Guild because Ms. DeGeneres is a member of the union. Her writers have been on strike, but Ms. DeGeneres has said she felt obligated to continue taping shows because other staff members would otherwise be laid off. She received support from a different union, Aftra, which argued in a letter to the Writers Guild that Ms. DeGeneres was obligated as a member to continue to work. Her supporters also noted that unlike other shows, including those of Jay Leno and David Letterman, Ms. DeGeneres’s is syndicated and could be canceled if obligations were not met. The guild countered that Ms. DeGeneres should have made a personal decision to support the writers. Cancellation of the New York shows does not mean Ms. DeGeneres has joined the strike. She will simply tape the shows at her regular studio in Los Angeles, a representative of the show said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/arts/television/15arts-PROSPECTOFNE_BRF.html

Most of his novels are historical, depicting figures as diverse as Milton, Chatterton and Oscar Wilde.

The virtue of localism, long cherished by small towns, is taking hold in urban centers across the country. The new $41 million SouthBridge complex in Scottsdale, Ariz. (right), is devoted entirely to one-off, locally owned stores and restaurants — no chains allowed, not even Starbucks. Although a few public efforts, like San Francisco’s Hayes Valley (see Page 38) and Denver’s Cherry Creek North shopping district (which is 75 percent chain-free), have succeeded in fending off franchises, SouthBridge is the first private urban development of its size to go completely indie. Other projects have made a similar effort. The Second Street District shopping center in Austin, Tex., opened in 2005 with 65 percent local tenants, and the owners of Larimer Square in Denver have spent the last several years letting the leases of places like Williams-Sonoma lapse and replacing them with regional businesses. It all adds up to a more exciting urban landscape. “When I go to New York, I love to find the little restaurant no one’s heard of,” says the SouthBridge developer Fred Unger. “I think that’s what we’re all yearning for, going back to Mayberry and Floyd the barber.” ",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/travel/tmagazine/14remix-caro-local-t.html

Despite highly laudatory reviews, Wright’s 500-plus-page tale of the tortured relations between blacks and whites in the sparsely populated desert country around the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Queensland languished on bookstore shelves. With a few exceptions, the independent bookstores run by political liberals, who have often expressed embarrassment at the sorry treatment of Australia’s indigenous people, were reluctant to promote it. Too difficult stylistically, said the salespeople at the Macleay Bookshop and Bookoccino, two of Sydney’s top literary outlets, where Wright’s novel was hard to find in the months after its publication.

Maybe it was the French aristocracy, who imported their haughty chefs in the 19th century, turning this belle époque town on the Basque coast of northern Spain into an epicurean resort. Or maybe it's the food-rich geography, a scallop-shaped coastline sandwiched between the fertile sea and mountainous farmlands. And then there are the Basques themselves, who approach eating with the same fervor as they do soccer. Whatever the case, this laid-back surfing resort is not for weak-willed dieters.

2007-11-19,Suicide Artist,"It is Rome, 1948, and Dante Sabato, a poet and translator — having negotiated his own survival throughout the war — is ready to end it all. Contemplating a dive off the Ponte Sisto bridge and into the Tiber, he is interrupted by an American G.I., who escorts him straight to a party. There Dante meets the Godfrey sisters, Gladys and Prudence, American actresses trying to make it in the booming Italian film industry. Gladys is a sexual adventurer, self-possessed and assertive. She fulfills all her wants and needs and, along the way, some of Dante’s. She appreciates Dante’s fervent lovemaking and the fact that he’s a busy man, busy with his work, busy with his other women, and doesn’t have the time or inclination to control her. Prudence, rumored to be fleeing an unfortunate affair with the director Billy Wilder, is reserved, the more beautiful of the two. Shuttling between them both, Dante finds — in the sum — love.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Murray-t.html

2007-11-19,Paperback Row,"THANKSGIVING NIGHT, by Richard Bausch. (Harper Perennial, $15.95.) Bausch’s 10th novel, set in the fictional town of Point Royal, Va., as its citizens prepare to celebrate the “last Thanksgiving of the century,” is old-fashioned — generously full of quirky characters, humor and details as well as real emotion. “It’s as if Bausch had set out to create the biggest dining table he could find, then put everyone he could think of around it,” Meg Wolitzer wrote in the Book Review. A very different Thanksgiving dinner, this one in Concord, Mass., is the subject of THE GHOST AT THE TABLE, by Suzanne Berne (Shannon Ravenel/Algonquin, $13.95). Two sisters — the elder determined to make everything perfect, the younger sullen and aloof — battle over their memories of childhood, particularly the death of their mother.

He did not deny the existence of criminals, of course, or the fact that many of them came from Sicily; but he did not believe, or said he did not, that these men, dispersed in cities across the nation, worked in conspiracy, either because he underestimated them, had been paid off or simply did not care. Hoover was obsessed with revolutionaries, Communists and anarchists; gangsters, no matter what else they do, tend to support the status quo — they like the world the way it is. So in the end, the Mafia was first understood not by G-men but by the bureaucrats at the federal government’s Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration. By following drug traffic across the nation, the orderly flow from port to truck to distributor to consumer, these men inadvertently mapped the underworld, and in the process created thousands of files, with each page dedicated to another hoodlum, another cog in the machine — runner, killer, distributor, shylock, boss. In the late 1950s, Senator John McClellan used these records to guide the hearings that finally brought the underworld to light. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Cohen2-t.html

The woman who was, as a 23-year-old medical student, briefly imprisoned along with her mother by the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and whose father, Air Force Gen. Alberto Bachelet, was tortured and died in military custody in 1974, is now Chile’s chief of state — while the dictator died, his reputation in tatters, shortly after she took office.

A lot of girls didn’t mind. A lot of them had troubles of their own. It was a cheering surprise, the sort of dismal shape you could be in and still get into some maenadic self-harmer’s pants. Granted, these encounters never developed — no morning-after breakfast or fun in the shower — but encased as I was in the armor of nihilism, I wouldn’t have stuck around for any of that rubbish anyway.

(This year in the Northeast, it reports, “winter will be about a degree milder than normal, on average, with slightly above-normal precipitation. ... The snowiest periods will be in mid-December, mid- and late January, and early to mid-March.”) How accurate was last winter’s forecast? Don’t ask. The editors write: “Our forecast for the winter of 2006-07 resulted in our lowest verification scores ever, with a 61 percent accuracy rate on the monthly regional precipitation and a 49 percent accuracy rate on monthly regional temperatures.

Of the 7,069 teachers who were hired in 2006, nearly 14 percent resigned by the end of the year, the union said, up from about 11 percent the year before. The numbers showed that “losing good teachers is the predominant staffing issue that the City Department of Education needs to address,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the union. Chris Cerf, a deputy chancellor at the Education Department, said in a statement that the numbers were inaccurate, and called the release of the figures a “media stunt.”",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/education/19mbrfs-TEACHERS.html

The film, with a screenplay by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, cost Paramount Pictures about $150 million to make and employs technology similar (though updated) to that used by Mr. Zemeckis in “The Polar Express” in 2004. More than 40 percent of the total receipts came from the 742 3-D theaters showing the film. DreamWorks Animation’s comedy “Bee Movie,” starring the voices of Jerry Seinfeld and Renée Zellweger, fell from first to second place with $14.3 million in its third weekend. The movie’s cumulative total to date is $93.9 million. Also dropping one spot, to No. 3, was “American Gangster” (Universal), the 1970s crime thriller starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. That film, directed by Ridley Scott, took in $13.2 million in its third weekend, bringing the total haul so far to $101 million. Falling from third to fourth place was the Vince Vaughn comedy “Fred Claus” (Warner Brothers) with $12 million in its second weekend and a total of $35.8 million to date.

The former curator, Marion True, did not attend the hearing. Her lawyer, Yannis Yannides, submitted a motion for dismissal, citing a California state law that sets a three-year statute of limitations for prosecution once a stolen artifact’s whereabouts have been made known. (The Getty acquired the wreath in 1993 and agreed to return it nearly a year ago, citing concerns about its provenance.) Greek investigators assert that the gold wreath was illegally excavated from an archaeological site in the northern province of Macedonia. Ms. True is also on trial in Italy on charges of trafficking in stolen antiquities acquired for the Getty. She has denied wrongdoing in both cases. In a related development The Associated Press reported that a judge in Pesaro, Italy, yesterday dismissed a local prosecutor’s legal claim to a bronze statue of a youth that is in the Getty’s collection. (The statue has also been claimed by Italy’s national government.) After long negotiations, the museum agreed in August to return 40 other artifacts to Italy.

Kleynkunst teaters (little art houses) thrived during this vibrant period, offering irreverent, politically charged Yiddish cabaret that drew from a variety of sources, including Weimar cabaret, Russian folk music, jazz, tango and traditional cantorial music. Sadly, it’s a type of performance that has largely been lost to time, but Rebecca Joy Fletcher, the writer and creator of “Kleynkunst! Warsaw’s Brave and Brilliant Yiddish Cabaret,” is bringing it back. “It’s almost unimaginable for most American Jews how vital, hip and avant-garde Yiddish-speaking Warsaw was between the wars,” she said.

He has been a season-ticket holder for 20 years, and before that he patrolled the sidelines while working for the West Virginia State Police. He said he thought that the Mountaineers would beat Connecticut by 14 points. When Pittsburgh comes here next weekend, it could be a different story, however.“The backyard brawl is never easy,” Stevens said.He took another sip of Crown Royal and continued soaking in the rarefied air in Morgantown, the improbable center of the college football universe.

As Figes, a leading historian of the Soviet period, concludes in “The Whisperers,” his extraordinary book about the impact of the gulag on “the inner world of ordinary citizens,” a great many victims “silently accepted and internalized the system’s basic values” and “conformed to its public rules.” Behind highly documented episodes of persecution, famine and war lie quieter, desperate stories of individuals and families who did what they could to survive, to find one another and to come to terms with the burden of being physically and psychologically broken. But it was not only repression that tore families apart. The regime’s reliance on “mutual surveillance” complicated their moral burden, instilling feelings of shame and guilt that endured long after years of imprisonment and exile.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/books/review/Rubenstein-t.html

Baldacci’s books have a real audience inside the Beltway. (Bill Clinton was spotted buying Baldacci’s “Simple Truth” at a bookstore in 1999.) And like a politician, he is often asked to speak in public. Baldacci’s Web site, helpfully, provides an “introduction text” for him — that is, suggested words for presenting him to a crowd. The first sentence of this text probably startles the librarians who must sometimes need to recite it, with its code-red level of thriller-world bombast: “Internationally acclaimed best-selling author David Baldacci shocked the publishing world when he burst on the literary scene with his incredible first novel, ‘Absolute Power.’ ” The suggested text ends more demurely: “Please help me welcome David Baldacci.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/books/review/25tbr.html

2007-11-26,Reader Responses,"""I just finished reading your article in today's paper. I am a physician and occasionally debate the topic of mistakes, errors, and negligence with legal acquaintances. The plaintiff attorneys equate error with negligence (and therefore payment) without exception. I counter that while certainly not desired, and as you point out when someone's life is in your hands we strive to ""avoid mistakes as much as possible"", perfection is not humanly possible. Negligence is, or should be, harmful action beyond the range of customary or expected outcome. In my opinion, this is not the same as error free which is an unattainable standard. Yet, try and convince a lay jury in retrospective analysis a decision, diagnosis, judgment was ""wrong"" but not negligent.

2007-11-26,Full Gallop,"What the Giammetti post reveals to me is that a candid discussion leads to all kinds of other thoughts and information: the real tool of our lives. We cannot have enough sharp tools in our box.

I mention this because the fashion industry is under extreme pressure from marketing. One of the biggest marketing/PR hoaxes is that grand old Paris fashion houses should be revived. Why on earth do we need Schiaparelli? Ah, because Diego Della Valle can make some money. It’s not complicated. There is no altruistic motive (let’s save a great name!). The fashion world, like the literary and art worlds, is full of great names that only a few people take the time and interest to investigate. But it’s limited, and should be limited. So they are reviving Ossie Clark—to capitalize on the fact that dozens of designers have already dipped into the Ossie well? Too late. Anyway, I’m not interested. I am intrigued by the latest Halston revival, mainly because of the players involved and because I like the challenge of seeing Halston done in a contemporary way.

2007-11-27,"Our House, Not Bauhaus","The German government invited architects yesterday to submit proposals for the task of reconstructing Berlin’s Stadtschloss, right, a Baroque royal palace torn down in 1950, Bloomberg News reported. The project is to include the partial re-creation of its facade and a towering cupola. A panel of specialists, including the architects David Chipperfield, Giorgio Grassi and Petra Kahlfeldt, is to judge entries in a competition lasting until November 2008, the German building minister, Wolfgang Tiefensee, said. Construction of the new building, which is to house some of Berlin’s antiquities and art holdings as well as parts of Humboldt University and the city library, is expected to begin in 2010 and be completed in 2013 or 2014, he said. To make way for the reconstituted castle, German lawmakers ordered the razing of the Palace of the Republic, home of the former East German parliament, a huge steel-and-concrete building with bronze-colored windows that opened in 1976. Critics have protested the demolition of the old building, asserting that it holds a beloved place in the city’s popular culture and that a rebuilt Baroque castle would be a parody of history.

It also argues that the order would pose “an open-ended danger” of further leak investigations against the defendants, Conte, James Valente (Balco’s former vice president), Barry Bonds’s former trainer Greg Anderson and the track coach Remi Korchemny. It argues they may need the materials to prepare for testimony in future cases.

The move aims to end years of tension and disputes between the current director of the festival, Francis Menotti — the son of the composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who founded the festival in 1958 and who died this year — and local administrators who have objected to the way the festival is managed. The culture ministry has been an important financial supporter. Critics have complained that the infighting had begun to take a toll on the quality of the festival’s offerings and its international standing. Mr. Rutelli said the new Spoleto festival, which may operate under a different name, would offer more opportunities to young artists, play host to performances throughout the year and open up to “other cultures.” Mr. Menotti has not yet responded to the proposed changes. “It is a decisive step, based on the desire to recreate, in a few years, an event of national and international standing,” Mr. Rutelli said.

Crew, Phillip Lim, Diesel, Louis Vuitton, Marni and Calvin Klein. “It’s these little things that make a difference,” says Millard Drexler, the mastermind behind J. Crew’s turnaround and its amped-up luxe quotient. “It says, ‘I really care about your shopping experience.’” (What these high-design disposables say about waste management, however, is another issue.) Prada’s embossed, stiff card stock is Milanese navy; Diane von Furstenberg’s open-top version has a sexy, low-cut back to expose its fuchsia interior; Jil Sander‘s has a bold-lettered, starkly minimal style; R by 45rpm’s envelope is slightly rough, unbleached paper.

2007-11-29,Christmas Trees Go Green,"The greenest tree in N.Y.C. (Credit: James Estrin/The New York Times)  Over the last several years, several big-city mayors, led by Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Richard M. Daley of Chicago, have made pronouncements that amount to a race to see which metropolis is the “greenest” in the country. They’re retrofitting old city buildings to cut energy waste and greenhouse gases, trying to curtail traffic, putting up solar panels. (For two independent analyses of green cities, go to the Green Guide and Yahoo.)  In the latest move, New York City’s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, illuminated last night, shines not with old-style incandescent bulbs but with 30,000 electricity-sipping light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, powered in part with solar panels. (And the tree was even cut with a hand saw, the city says.)  There are some signs of spreading green tree envy.   A recent article in The Minneapolis Star Tribune questioned the cost and carbon dioxide emissions from lighting St. Paul’s giant, and incandescent-lit, Christmas tree. The headline asked: “A bright and shining energy waste?”  The reporter, Karen Youso, wrote that the city’s tree-lighting practices, with 60,000 incandescent bulbs burning around the clock for five and a half weeks, costs about $1,300 and results in 18.7 tons of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping emission from human activities.  She asked state energy officials to calculate the financial and environmental cost if St. Paul erected the tree and bulbs now blazing in Rockefeller Center. The answer was $136.80 and one-tenth as much carbon dioxide.   It’ll be interesting to see what St. Paul and the corporate partners that pay for the display do next year.   What are other cities doing about the kilowatt-hours and carbon dioxide that come with holiday decor? ",Blogs,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/blogs/29dotearth-green-tr75.html

2007-11-30,An Air of Expectation,"Tim Burton was jittery when the Baguette interviewed him recently but who could blame him? He’s got both a movie — “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” and a baby — with Helena Bonham Carter — making an appearance in the world about the same time. “I’m a bit nervous about both I guess,” Mr. Burton said.Ms. Carter co-stars in “Sweeney” as Mrs. Lovett, and Sacha Baron Cohen plays looney rival barber Signor Adolfo Pirelli. The Baguette asked Mr. Burton about casting non-singers in the title roles of the film.“It gives the film, I think an extra layer of something that you don’t necessarily get from the stage,” which led the Baguette to ask about the casting of Mr. Cohen, who inhabited a similarly over-the-top persona as Borat.“Sacha, he’s great! I’ll never forget it, he came in to audition and he had the book for ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ and basically did pretty much the whole song book,” Mr. Burton said. “I knew he could do it. He has no fear.”Mr. Burton’s most palpable fears involved Stephen Sondheim’s reaction to his film. “I was so nervous. I think I was more nervous showing it to him than anybody.”Before they showed the movie to Mr. Sondheim he told the producers, “You show him the movie. I’ll be down at the pub down the street.” Mr. Burton said he was relieved that Mr. Sondheim liked the film. “He was extremely positive.”As the Bagger mentioned, the movie has a rather crimson palette.“We tried to use a bright color red, you know, because it’s Christmas.”",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/an-air-of-expectation/

2007-12-03,Q & A: David Downton,"I first met David Downton maybe five years ago at a showing of his drawings in Paris. His subject was Erin O’Connor. You might say David, who is English, has an obsession with Erin’s long neck and lines. Well, she was meant for charcoal. Shortly after that meeting, I asked him to sketch a Dior couture dress in the studio, for a story about the making of a collection. Our link then and now was our admiration for the work of Joe Eula, and a fascination with the man. I got to know Joe well and in the last years of his life we worked together on a number of illustrated articles for the Times, including one about the denizens of the back track at Belmont. This past January, at the Dior show, David told me he was planning to bring out a magazine of fashion illustration and asked if I’d write something about Joe. Issue #1 of Pourquoi Pas? has drawings by Rene Gruau, Eula, Richard Gray, Jason Brooks, with illustrations by David of Amanda Harlech, Jade Parfitt, and Carmen Dell’ Orefice. Among the writers contributing are Sarah Mower, Tony Glenville and Tim Blanks. The 72-page magazine is on heavy stock, costs about $40, and is available at pqpmagazine.com.
