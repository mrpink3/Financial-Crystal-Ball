First-half sales rose to 84 billion yuan from 80.22 billion yuan. The chairman, Wang Xiaochu, 47, is counting on getting a nationwide wireless license to raise earnings as more Chinese opt for mobile phone services. Revenue from local fixed-line calls, which makes up 51 percent of China Telecom's business, rose 0.7 percent, the company said. To counter competition from mobile phone operators like China Unicom and China Mobile (Hong Kong), China Telecom offers a cordless phone service known as Little Smart in northern cities like Tianjin and Chengde that lets users make calls within cities. Still, China Telecom, which is based in Beijing, will slow investment in Little Smart as the company moves closer to securing a mobile phone license, Mr. Wang said.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/01/business/world-business-briefing-asia-china-profit-flat-at-telephone.html

Pirro yesterday for the party's nomination to challenge Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton next year. Mr. Davis said he chose Ms. Pirro over her leading rival, Ed Cox, because she was ""dynamic and exciting and can expose Hillary Clinton's broken promises."" He predicted that Mrs. Clinton, who did unusually well in some upstate Republican strongholds in 2000, would have a harder time next year because of her first-term record. ""She said she would create tens of thousands of jobs; where are they?"" Mr. Davis said. Rodney Capel, the state Democratic Party's executive director, said, ""It's bad timing for the G.O.P. smear campaign, since Senator Clinton just delivered thousands of jobs to the western New York area by keeping local bases from closing.""

2005-09-02,The Listings: Sept. 2 -- Sept. 8; RILO KILEY,"A lot of indie rock bands depend on a certain disarray -- almost but not quite falling apart -- for their frisson. The Los Angeles band Rilo Kiley, led by the charismatic singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis, above, and the songwriter-guitarist Blake Sennett, isn't one of them. With each outing, this group grows more confident, lately narrowing a panoply of styles to a blend of show-tuney pop and bold country soul, the preciousness of both tempered by brash, intimate lyrics. Interpreting her band's songs with nuance and sometimes heartbreaking vulnerability, Ms. Lewis makes no effort to conform to unschooled indie faltering. She goes for it, and her vocals on tunes like the wrenching other-woman vignette ""Does He Love You?"" on the 2004 album ""More Adventurous"" (Brute/Beaute) make one hope the band will consider doing a covers record, one that darkly reimagines radio hits by Linda Ronstadt and Crystal Gayle. Of course, Rilo Kiley has a lot to say on its own. ""It's a Hit"" ruefully compares wartime troop deployment with the mindless shaking of salt, and the torchy ""I Never"" captures Patsy Cline-esque longing. Perhaps opening for the pop phenom Coldplay, as Rilo Kiley will this week at Madison Square Garden, is a portent of the fame that awaits this band. When Coldplay's earnest master of generalization, Chris Martin, sings on his latest hit ""birds come flying from the underground,"" one suspects he is perhaps talking about the kind of joy transmitted by bands like his show's opening act.

2005-09-02,The Listings: Sept. 2 -- Sept. 8; 'CAPRICCIO',"Are words or music more important to opera? The question might not seem worth pondering for an entire evening if it had not been so charmingly woven through Strauss's final opera. The composer called it a ""conversation piece for music,"" but ""Capriccio,"" which opens the New York City Opera's new season on Wednesday, is actually a brilliant piece of meta-opera: music that spins around itself, music through which Strauss bid loving farewell to the genre in which he had been unsurpassed. Strauss and Clemens Krauss wrote the slyly ironic libretto that centers on Countess Madeleine, who is being courted by a composer and a poet. The two suitors team up to create what the audience soon realizes is the very opera being performed before its eyes. The work opens with a lush string sextet and includes some of the most sublime soprano writing in the Strauss literature. Pamela Armstrong, who shined last season in ""La Rondine,"" returns as Madeleine in this new production directed by Stephen Lawless (computer rendering of the set above). Ryan MacPherson plays the composer Flamand, and Mel Ulrich is the poet Olivier. There is even a role for ""a young ballerina"" and City Opera has recruited Ashley Bouder, a principal dancer at the City Ballet. George Manahan conducts. (Wednesday night at 6:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $45 to $110.)

The European Union is considering a political declaration, as early as this week, to ease political sensitivities over Turkey within Europe and pave the way for negotiations to begin on time. While it is expected to stop short of demanding that Turkey grant Cyprus diplomatic recognition, it would underline that Turkey must grant all the bloc's members, Cyprus included, commercial relations by opening Turkish ports and airports to trade from them.

Approximately $500,000 was sent to unknown recipients in Amman, Jordan, by way of crew members of Royal Jordanian Airlines, according to the Bronx district attorney's office. Those arrested are charged collectively with 1,237 counts of money laundering, possession of forged instruments, trademark counterfeiting and other offenses.

Stallman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled against the group's petition to block the Museum of Arts and Design from buying the building.

The judge also dismissed the group's claim that the city should have to pass special legislation to sell the building. Landmark West said it would appeal the ruling.

2005-09-02,Guillermo Toledo,"Mr. Toledo, who as a rakish department-store salesman is the antihero of Alex de la Iglesia's black comedy ""El Crimen Perfecto,"" may just be beginning to register on the radar of American filmgoers: he was last seen here as a cuckolded lover in the musical sex farce ""The Other Side of the Bed,"" in 2003. But Mr. Toledo, 35, above, has been a household name in Spain since appearing on the wildly popular sitcom ""Siete Vidas"" (""Seven Lives"") from 1999 to 2002. In addition to his Spanish feature film work, Mr. Toledo has become known for his outspoken criticism of the conservative People's Party. When he served as a host of the 2003 Goya Awards (where he was also a nominee for best new actor), Mr. Toledo turned the ceremony into a group protest against the impending war in Iraq, much to the dismay of the Spanish Ministry of Culture. He is also a founding member of the Madrid-based theater collective Animalario, which toured the country last year with ""Alejandro y Ana,"" a play spoofing the nuptials of the daughter of the former prime minister, José María Aznar (who lost his job when his party was voted out last year just after the terrorist attacks on Madrid). Now, two years after his controversial appearance as host of the Goya Awards, Mr. Toledo finds himself nominated again, this time for best actor for his role in ""El Crimen Perfecto."" In a recent interview with a Spanish film magazine, he linked that film's implicit critique of consumerism to his own political beliefs: ""We need more black humor and less fear,"" he said, adding later, ""We need to be wilder, cruder. We need to lash out at a social structure that doesn't work."" (Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)330-8182.)

2005-09-02,The Listings: Sept. 2 -- Sept. 8; 'BIRTH OF A CULTURE: 60'S AND 70'S SURF PHOTOGRAPHY BY LeROY GRANNIS',"The problem with photographing athletics is that while movement is of the essence in sports, photographs don't move. Surfing doubles the problem. Both the athletes and the playing field are moving quite speedily. What a surfing photographer like LeRoy Grannis wants is to freeze the moment at an instant of maximum tension: the towering wave just before it crashes from a sheer glassy green wall into frothy chaos; the surfer, an escape artist, scooting along just ahead of the angry white water that threatens to engulf him and take him down. The rider falling like Icarus (above in a photograph from 1966), diving away from his board so as not to be hit by it in the ensuing turbulence, is a good motif, too. Of course, the ocean itself is an eternally photogenic subject, and man against the sea an enduring mythic theme. All these elements plus romantic nostalgia combine in new, big color prints of images that Mr. Grannis shot in the 60's and 70's. Born in 1917, Mr. Grannis started surfing in the 60's and shortly thereafter took up photography, which earned him major awards for his work for surfing magazines and eventual initiation into the International Surfing Hall of Fame.

If the neighboring farmer's hired man ""had touched a drop at all,"" the teenage hero of ""In the Province of Saints"" recalls, ""he'd be singing -- some familiar Irish song about rebels or emigration and the never never of coming back; songs about the loss of land, the loss of love, but most of all, songs about . . . longing for Ireland."" O'Malley's beautifully written first novel also sings many of those songs. Set in rural southeastern Ireland in the late 1970's, it tells the coming-of-age story of Michael McDonagh. Michael roams the fields and rivers when he is not caring for his mother, who is ill with cancer, while his father leaves for Boston to find work and then drinks up his earnings. There is much talk of rain, and ghosts, and the smell of dung, and the reader feels the claustrophobia and hopelessness that coexist with the wild beauty of the land. As Michael grows up, he comes to terms with his family's secrets, both personal and political. In the end we know that he, too, will leave Ireland for good. A familiar Irish song, but the words will break your heart.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

2005-09-05,Nonfiction Chronicle,"STEALING GOD'S THUNDER: Benjamin Franklin's Lightning Rod and the Invention of America. By Philip Dray. (Random House, $25.95.) In the 1740's, electricity was as much a parlor trick as an object of serious investigation; one scientist liked to hang an orphan from the ceiling with silk and invite ladies to draw sparks from his nose with a charged glass tube. Through experiments slightly less baroque, Franklin became convinced electricity was a fluid that could have either a positive or negative balance, like a checking account. He refined devices for storing electrical charges, which he named ""batteries"" for their resemblance to rows of guns, and in 1750 he designed an experiment to show that lightning was a form of electricity. He designed another two years later, which involved flying a kite. But maybe you've heard of the kite. Having noticed that lightning preferred to run through metal, Franklin put up the world's first lightning rods that summer, and Dray tells how the rod slowly displaced an earlier, ineffectual means of protection, the ringing of church bells during thunderstorms. Dray offers no startling discoveries or bold reinterpretations, but his prose is elegant, Franklin is charming and the science is easy: Do lightning rods attract extra lightning? Should they be pointed or blunt? Do they cause earthquakes? Franklin's curiosity about smallpox, botany, wood-burning stoves, musical glass disks, mesmerism, fossils and ballooning make cameo appearances.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html

Before this week, Ellis's only other appearance on the Times list came in 1991, when ""American Psycho,"" published as a softcover original, spent three weeks on the paperback fiction list. The Times Book Review, as it happens, gave that novel the kind of advance publicity no amount of money can buy, publishing an essay by Roger Rosenblatt -- under the headline ""Snuff This Book! Will Bret Easton Ellis Get Away With Murder?"" -- arguing that ""American Psycho"" shouldn't be published at all. (Fifteen months later, also in the Book Review, John Irving called Rosenblatt's essay ""prissy enough to please Jesse Helms."") Ellis's fifth novel, ""Lunar Park,"" enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 13. In an interview on the ""Today"" show, Ellis told Katie Couric that his novel is ""an homage to Stephen King and all the books I liked like that when I was a boy. . . . I wanted to write a haunted house book, a genre book, a supernatural thriller."" He also told Couric that, when he reread ""American Psycho"" recently, even he was ""shocked by it. . . .

The office used to belong to William S. Paley, the legendary tycoon who personified CBS for more than 60 years.

2005-09-05,Political Science,"When Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor of the eminent journal Science, was asked what had led so many American scientists to feel that George W. Bush's administration is anti-science, he isolated a familiar pair of culprits: climate change and stem cells. These represent, he said, ""two solid issues in which there is a real difference between a strong consensus in the science community and the response of the administration to that consensus."" Both issues have in fact riled scientists since the early days of the administration, and both continue to have broad repercussions. In March 2001, the White House abruptly withdrew its support for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and the U.S. withdrawal was still a locus of debate at this summer's G8 summit in Scotland. And the administration's decision to limit federal funds for embryonic-stem-cell research four years ago -- a move that many scientists worry has severely hampered one of the most fruitful avenues of biomedical inquiry to come along in decades -- resulted in a shift in the dynamics of financing, from the federal government to the states and private institutions. In November 2004, Californians voted to allocate $3 billion for stem-cell research in what was widely characterized as a ""scientific secession.""",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/magazine/political-science.html

All night long, British frigates, stationed between the two fleets, had been burning pairs of blue lights, every hour on the hour, as pre-arranged. It was the agreed signal that the enemy was standing to the south, just as was wanted, straight into the jaws of the British guns.

2005-09-05,UP FRONT,"This week we present more evidence of how the publishing industry is caught in a tug of war between corporatization and disorganization. The question at hand is what will become of writers' correspondence now that typewritten letters have been eclipsed by e-mail messages. The answer, it turns out, is anyone's guess. E-mail correspondence has created technical, legal and practical headaches unimaginable only a few years ago. In interviews with people across the book business, Rachel Donadio, a writer and editor at the Book Review, discovered that few publishing houses have established policies for archiving their e-mail messages, and not all editors and writers take the time or effort to save theirs. Random House, for instance, ""does not have in place a distinct corporate policy for archiving electronic author-publisher correspondence, and we have yet to establish a central electronic archive for housing publishing material,"" a company spokesman told Donadio. The New Yorker, meanwhile, routinely purges its e-mail messages. Technology experts might caution employees to delete old e-mail correspondence to avoid overwhelming the server, and libel lawyers might advise a similar policy, lest messages be used against a company in court, but what's good news for the corporation is bad news for historians concerned about the future of biography. To find out whether you'll ever read the collected e-mail correspondence of Jonathan Franzen, Rick Moody, Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith or Salman Rushdie, turn to Page 14.

This perfectly captures the spirit of our friend and work mate, Andrew T. Knipe, who passed away Saturday after a long battle with ALS, a neurological ailment also know as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 38. After being diagnosed in 2000, Andy pursued a tireless schedule of speeches, videos and fund-raising efforts for research and patient care. He was always optimistic and positive. Never down or self pitying, he made a point of trying to make sure his friends and family were okay. A remarkable soul. Andy joined the BBDO advertising agency after winning the prestigious Rich Martel Award. He created awardwinning and acclaimed work for many of our clients, including Pepsi, HBO, FedEx and the NJ Devils. At the agency's annual meeting several months ago, Andy was recognized with the Founder's Award. The outpouring of emotion for him as he accepted was overwhelming. Over the past few weeks as Andy's condition worsened, scores of BBDOers reached out to him with hospital visits, notes and emails. He felt our love and support. His brother, Rich, wrote a note to Andy's friends at BBDO the other day: ""I would like everyone to please see this as Andy getting out of jail. He was wrongfully accused but served a five year sentence gracefully, productively and with dignity. Although we will all miss him, none of us will miss what that relentless disease did to him. Andrew told many of us that when he dreamt at night, he was always well. Walking, talking and without pain. Now his dreams have become a continual reality.""

2005-09-06,Gentleman of the Court,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - IN October 1971, the White House tapped Assistant Attorney General William H. Rehnquist to respond to my critique of someone at the top of its short list for one of the two vacancies created by the nearly simultaneous resignations of two justices. I found his tepid apologia underwhelming. Yet within two months, when Mr. Rehnquist took the Supreme Court seat once marked for the target of my critique, I began to see how foolish it would have been to measure him by his defense of a candidate about whom he probably felt lukewarm. While it may be too soon to assess the chief justice's enduring impact, it is not too soon to reflect on why so many who served with him as colleagues, worked for him as law clerks or appeared before him as advocates are already prepared to render a verdict of greatness and to tell the world how deeply his passing is mourned.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/06/opinion/gentleman-of-the-court.html

2005-09-06,Mexican President Haggles Over Pemex Reform,"President Vicente Fox, right, has vetoed a bill to lighten the heavy tax burden on Petróleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil monopoly. The president is sending it back to Congress this week with proposed changes. Pemex, as the company is known, pays about two-thirds of its revenue in taxes and accounts for about a third of all government spending. The bill would give Pemex as much as $2.3 billion more money next year for investment. The oil monopoly badly needs more money for exploration as its reserves are dwindling. Although Mr. Fox has supported the basic outline of the reform, his administration, along with state governments, objected to the final version of the bill, arguing that it would strip both the federal government and the states of too much revenue too quickly. Mexico is the second-largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the United States.

He graduated from City College in 1937 at a time when it was considered the ""common man's Harvard."" Awarded a scholarship, he went on to attend Harvard Law and graduated in 1940. His reverence for Harvard was deep, reinforcing his conviction that mankind is capable of profound good. Less than a year after graduation, and ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he began his airforce training. For his service in the Pacific arena, he received the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a citation from General MacArthur. Following the war, his love of flying led him to serve as traffic manager for Empire Airlines. Ultimately, he returned to the practice of law, becoming legal counsel to the Foreign Press Association. Always driven by his concern for humanitarian causes throughout the world, his exemplary international career as a corporate lawyer was often combined with his pursuit of equality and justice on a global scale. Most notably, he successfully argued one of the first of many cases arising from the Iran hostage situation before the World Court at the Hague. Everett's lifetime of varied experience reflects a curious and extremely facile mind. His passions were expressed on land by a competitive game of tennis; on sea as a skilled sailor; and in air as a private pilot. His incisive intellect and wit were a testament to a many-faceted personality. A fabulous raconteur, he held any audience spellbound. In simple words, he was a man larger than life. As such, he took the phrase ""go forth and multiply"" seriously. He is predeceased by his brother, Dr. Sanford H. Eisenberg, and his brother-in-law, Dr. Harold Diner. Four years ago, he lost the true love of his life, Viviane Eisenberg, the former Viviane Tubiana, past prima donna of Le Theatre National de L'Opera Comique. Additionally, two other mates have played important roles: the mother of his daughters, Hermione Sakolsky, and his current soul-mate, Kay Peck. Everett is lovingly remembered by his children, Amy Thor and Deborah HowlandMurray, son-in-law David Murray and his younger sister, Sydelle Diner. He was thrilled by his role as grandpa to seven grandchildren and 73/4 great grandchildren. A global cadre of nieces, nephews and cousins will miss him dearly. In his memory, and with regard to his respect for individual free will, contributions may be made to any cause that promotes the ideals by which he lived. Had he survived, he would surely have lent his help to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and to do so would also be a fitting memorial. A memorial service will be held at 3PM on October 2, 2005 at the Astoria Center of Israel, 27-35 Crescent St, Long Island City, NY.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/classified/paid-notice-deaths-eisenberg-everett-arnold.html

2005-09-09,The Listings: Sept. 9 -- Sept. 15; ARCADE FIRE,"Last fall was just about the perfect time for the Montreal band Arcade Fire, above, to arrive on the scene. In a Halloween season full of pre-election anxiety, this little indie rock band's urgent anthems suggested both the fragility and resilience of an embattled bohemian idyll. The hot ticket at last year's CMJ Music Marathon, it offered shows that had the zealous verve of a high school musical theater revue. The yelping frontman Win Butler and the diminutive singer and multi-instrumentalist Régine Chassagne, who are married, turned confident mistakes into shows of strength. Arcade Fire's debut album, ""Funeral"" (Merge), a loose suite with no fewer than four tracks titled ""Neighborhood,"" draws on the melodic surge of the Pixies as well as the histrionic punk of the Talking Heads. David Byrne, a fan, has even joined Arcade Fire onstage a couple of times for its cover of his band's ""This Must Be the Place."" But additional folk instrumentation gives Arcade Fire's music a Northern Gothic feel that sets it apart from the current gaggle of young post-punk devotees. The gravitas of ""Funeral,"" inspired by the deaths of older relatives of several members of the band, somehow never blunts the life-affirming, flailingly danceable thump of songs like ""Neighborhood No.3 (Power Out)"" or the jerky pogo-stomp of ""Neighborhood No.2 (Laika)."" But with a group this earnest, there's always room for reverie, as when Ms. Chassagne pays homage to her Haitian roots in ""Une Année Sans Lumière."" The sense that whimsy is hard-won amid life's chill made ""Funeral"" the soundtrack of a wound-licking winter. Arcade Fire now returns triumphantly to CMJ, a year after its auspicious New York concerts, to make Central Park its neighborhood for a night. (5:30 p.m., with Sound Team and Bell Orchestre, Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street; $30 in advance, $35 at the show; sold out.)

Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, his Democratic primary opponent, Leslie Crocker Snyder, unveiled a new advertisement yesterday that contends that his office thwarted efforts to change the Rockefeller-era drug laws. These laws, enacted in 1973, impose long mandatory prison sentences on anyone, even a first-time offender, who is caught with a certain amount of drugs.

2005-09-09,The Listings: Sept. 9 -- Sept. 15; MICHAEL FITZGERALD AND JAMES KENNEDY,"The notion of the divided self takes literal form in Brian Friel's 1964 comedy, ""Philadelphia, Here I Come!"" Gareth O'Donnell, the play's sensitive protagonist, is a young man readying to leave his home in Ireland for the wilder climes of America. His ambivalence about his impending departure -- about everything, in fact -- is plain to see: there are not one but two Gareths onstage at all times, the public and the private, the real Gareth and the imaginary, tougher-tongued character he'd like to be. In the amiable new revival of the play at the Irish Repertory Theater, Michael FitzGerald movingly embodies the public Gareth, who must face the bruising silence of his emotionally withholding father, the quiet kindness of his lost love, the boisterous indifference of his mates. The febrile James Kennedy (above left, with Mr. FitzGerald) is the leprechaun inhabiting his reeling mind, a teasing presence who distracts Michael with a constant stream of chatter: bits of old movies, fantasies of the glorious future, bursts of bile mocking the banality of his father's conversation. The lively rapport between these wonderfully mismatched actors is the captivating centerpiece in Mr. Friel's tale of a heart torn in two. (Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737.)

2005-09-09,The Listings: Sept. 9 -- Sept. 15; JENNY SCHEINMAN,"The violin has a long history in jazz, but few conspicuous heroes; for every Stephane Grappelli, there are dozens of horn and rhythm players of greater renown. So it makes sense that Jenny Scheinman, above, has earned her recent accolades in an unforced and roundabout fashion. She's ubiquitous on the indie fringe of New York's jazz scene, appearing every Tuesday at Barbès in Brooklyn (often in a string trio with Carla Kihlstedt, of the exuberantly eclectic Tin Hat Trio) and every Wednesday at the Living Room (backed by the Handsome Band, which she shares with Norah Jones). This month she has interrupted this regular schedule to focus on a special ensemble in celebration of an outstanding new CD, ""12 Songs"" (Cryptogramophone). It maintains an aura of wistful lyricism and dreamy self-reflection, not unlike the music of Ms. Jones. But the songs are structurally diverse, ranging from the gently twangy ""Song of the Open Road"" to the circus march ""Moe Hawk"" to the sepia-tinged border postcard ""Satelite."" More crucially, the album's septet consists of musicians who, like Ms. Scheinman, playfully apply jazz techniques to many varieties of folk music. Chief among them is the guitarist Bill Frisell, Ms. Scheinman's most visible employer; his replacement in her forthcoming gig at Tonic, one ""Moe Hawk,"" will resemble him uncannily. Also playing are the cornetist Ron Miles, the clarinetist Doug Wieselman and the drummer Mark Ferber -- and, as a bonus, a 16-piece string orchestra studded with the heavyweights Eyvind Kang, Mat Maneri and Dana Leong. Counting Ms. Scheinman, there will be nine violinists onstage. (Monday at 8 and 10 p.m. at Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501; cover, $12.)

2005-09-09,"Arts, Briefly; Muted Parties","Historically, this week is the beginning of the media party season, but its pace and mood will be slowed by the national tragedy on the Gulf Coast. The Forbes annual media party, in which the Forbes family and executives treat working reporters and editors to a ride on the Hudson River aboard a huge yacht, did not take place as scheduled on Wednesday. ""It has been a five-year annual party night for competitors and colleagues in the media,"" said Monie Begley, a spokeswoman for Forbes. ""But the events in New Orleans are just too vivid, so not this year."" Condé Nast, the publisher of magazines including Vogue and Vanity Fair, had its Fashion Rocks concert scheduled for last night. The company took a different approach, deciding that the show must go on but rechristening it as a benefit. Condé Nast executives said the show, which is held at Radio City Music Hall and includes musical acts from David Bowie to Shakira, right, to Tim McGraw, will now donate all ticket proceeds, about $250,000, to relief efforts for victims of Hurricane Katrina. The Newhouse family owns Condé Nast, but it also owns The Times-Picayune, the daily paper in New Orleans that managed to do some gritty reporting despite having to evacuate its offices, and its foundation has already donated $1 million to the American Red Cross. A taped version of Fashion Rocks is scheduled for broadcast tonight at 9 p.m. on CBS and will now follow the multinetwork telethon to raise money for those affected by the tragedy. ""When the events of New Orleans happened, we thought it was important to turn on a dime and use the buzz and awareness that this show creates to galvanize America to donate to the organizations that are working to alleviate the suffering on the Gulf Coast,"" said Richard Beckman, president of Condé Nast's media group.

Released in 1983, the film did well enough at the box office, but critics were largely unimpressed, even contemptuous. S.E. Hinton had written her wildly popular book in her sophomore year of high school, and it was published in 1967. Years later, a school librarian wrote to Mr. Coppola and, on behalf of both students and faculty, asked him to turn Ms. Hinton's unvarnished adolescent musings into a film. In 1982, he complied and shot a movie he would describe as ""a 'Gone With the Wind' for 14-year-old girls.""",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/movies/coppola-pays-a-return-visit-to-his-gone-with-the-wind-for-teenagers.html

2005-09-09,The Listings: Sept. 9 -- Sept. 15; DAVID NEUMANN,"In the current economic climate, downtown choreographers (and audiences) don't often have the luxury of encore performances. On Thursday, David Neumann and the Advanced Beginner Group are bucking this disheartening trend with his crowd-pleaser ""tough, the tough,"" which had its premiere in April at the Danspace Project. There is a bit of cast shuffling, including the replacement of Kimiye Corwin by the choreographer's friend and collaborator Adrienne Truscott; Mr. Neumann, above, whose fluid physical presence and intelligent wit always threaten in the scene-stealing department, was one of the highlights of her uneven but engaging ""they will take to the highways,"" also seen last April, at P.S. 122. Cast changes lend themselves to shifts in choreography, but basically ""tough, the tough"" returns intact. Created in collaboration with the composer Hal Hartley and the playwright Will Eno, this abstract dance, performed in the round, uses text, soundscape and pedestrian movement to explore the organizing principles of routine, from daily life to the Marx Brothers to the changing of the guard along the Pakistan-India border. Like much of Mr. Neumann's work, it examines the brain's relationship to the body in a self-conscious, humorous look at the human animal; in his words, ""how we deal with space, what we think we're communicating when we're communicating."" Mr. Neumann is often talked about as the reigning funny man of dance. His is a sly, sophisticated humor, more thoughtful than slapstick, and ""tough, the tough"" represents a maturing of his voice, with dark shadings. While Mr. Neumann rejects interpretations that have linked this piece to events surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks, he does acknowledge a certain apocalyptic whiff in the air. As he says, ""Death and disaster are all around, and yet we still have to get up and brush our teeth.""

Stefan Pryor, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which acquired the building from Deutsche Bank last year, said, ""We will begin deconstruction in the new year and take it down over the course of about 12 months.""

2005-09-12,Among the Believers,"Benjamin Kunkel's first novel, ""Indecision,"" published last month, concerns a young man living in Manhattan and trying, as the title suggests, to figure out what to do with his life. He has a B.A. in philosophy and an active, if confusing, romantic life; he gets by on a combination of office work and parental subsidy. In his author's affectionate estimation, offered over a beer on a recent evening at a Brooklyn bar, this young man, whose name is Dwight Wilmerding, is ""kind of an idiot."" Perhaps, but he may also be - the critical response to ""Indecision"" suggests as much - an especially representative kind of idiot. His plight, after all, is - for people of his age and background - a familiar one: an alienation from his own experience brought about by too much knowledge, too many easy, inconsequential choices, too much self-consciousness. Bred in a culture consecrated to the entitled primacy of the individual, he discovers that he lacks a self, a coherent identity, maybe a soul. He feels that he could be anyone. ""It wasn't very unusual for me to lie awake at night,"" he confesses, ""feeling like a scrap of sociology blown into its designated corner of the world. But knowing the clichés are clichés doesn't help you to escape them. You still have to go on experiencing your experience as if no one else has ever done it.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/among-the-believers.html

After a career that began in the 1950's in the modern dance theater of Alwin Nikolais and included the exhilarating downtown multimedia experiments of the 1960's, Ms. Blossom, at 79, knows how to command a stage from the moment she enters.

2005-09-12,Inside the List,"RUNNING NUMBERS: This week, a new title makes its debut at No. 11 on the nonfiction list: ""1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"" by Charles C. Mann. It joins David McCullough's ""1776,"" about another big year in American history, which reclaims the top spot, and Bernard Goldberg's ""100 People Who Are Screwing Up America,"" which is at No. 5. Goldberg's list omits Christopher Columbus, a looming presence in ""1491,"" which argues that pre-Columbian civilization was far more populous and sophisticated than previously thought. Just consider the ancient king of Mutal: ""Like most Maya rulers, Chak Tok Ich'aak spent a lot of his time luxuriating in his court while dwarf servants attended to his whims and musicians played conch shells and wooden trumpets in the background."" A correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and Science magazine, Mann traveled widely, and at times hazardously, to research his book. There was the time the fuel gauge jammed on a trip to Mayan ruins in Mexico. ""Just as we were landing, the plane ran out of gas,"" Mann recounted rather breathlessly, on the telephone from his home in Amherst, Mass. ""We landed completely silently. And the pilot, in a gesture I had previously only seen associated with the pope, ran out of the plane and kissed the ground."" And then there were the bugs. ""I learned three things about Amazonian termites,"" Mann said. ""There's a whole lot of them, they're extremely fast, and they bite."" GLASS CEILING, GLASS SLIPPER: Five new books enter the fiction list this week: four glossy crime novels (""Point Blank,"" ""Tyrannosaur Canyon,"" ""Vanish"" and ""Without Mercy"") and one book of poems (""Reflections of a Peacemaker"") meant to raise money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. In such a crowded field, it's impressive that some recent debuts are still holding on. They include ""The Undomestic Goddess,"" by Sophie Kinsella, at No. 12 in its sixth week on the list, and ""Match Me if You Can,"" by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, at No. 13 in its third. Both are chick-lit novels about overworked women that appeal to overworked women. In ""The Undomestic Goddess,"" Samantha Sweeting leaves her job as a high-powered London lawyer and heads into the English countryside. When she stops to ask directions at a fancy house, she's assumed to be an applicant for a housekeeping job. One thing leads to another, and Samantha soon discovers the joys of . . . baking. We'll spare you the feminist critique. In Phillips's ""Match Me if You Can,"" the heroine inherits her grandmother's Chicago match-making business and is smitten by her most demanding client. Too bad Chak Tok Ich'aak isn't around anymore. Now he would have been quite a catch. TBR",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2005-09-12,N.F.L. Matchups | Week 1,"The evergreen offense of the Colts remains a wonder. Peyton Manning has started all 112 of his pro games and has averaged 263 passing yards a game. Last season, he set an N.F.L. record with 49 touchdown passes. Marvin Harrison is still a gamebreaking receiver, wideout Brandon Stokley is ready after missing the preseason because of a shoulder injury, and the offensive line is top grade. The Ravens will counter with their usual stifling defense, led by Ray Lewis at middle linebacker and Ed Reed at safety. Newcomers like cornerback Samari Rolle and outside linebacker Tommy Polley should help. When the Ravens have the ball, they are far less impressive. They are trying everything to make Kyle Boller a good quarterback; they designated Jim Fassel as the offensive coordinator and brought in Rick Neuheisel, the former University of Washington coach, to all but baby-sit for Boller. If that doesn't work, Jamal Lewis will have to do even more heavy-duty running. The Colts' defense, despite Dwight Freeney's dominance up front, wins no prizes and is hardly healthy. Corey Simon, a late pickup at defensive tackle, may help considerably, but not yet. Ravens Coach Brian Billick said, ""We're a better team than we were last year.""

(This issue could arise, for example, in litigation brought by biotechnologists against laws proscribing therapeutic cloning.)

2005-09-12,Shoot the Piano Player,"The cliché in the critical writing about the French New Wave is that the innovations that once seemed so jarring are now so common that they go unnoticed. But the American critics who were bewildered by the playfulness of the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai's ""Chungking Express"" in 1994 could have been the offspring of the American critics who, in 1960, were similarly baffled by François Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player,"" perhaps the starting point of free-spirited modern cinema. No New Wave movie contains more of that movement's spirit than ""Shoot the Piano Player."" There is the loving yet knowing poetic distillation of American genre films (in this case, noir), and the location shooting that builds on the open-air tradition that Renoir and Vigo brought to French film of the 30's.

2005-09-12,Val Lewton Horror Collection,"The Grade-B horror pictures made in the 1940's for RKO by the producer and writer Val Lewton -- several of them in collaboration with the director Jacques Tourneur -- may have been put together on the run and with pocket change. But those are the only things remotely cheap about them. Lewton was as fascinated by monsters as his colleagues over at that other studio, Universal, were. But his monsters tend to walk around in street clothes, with regular, everyday faces: the fact that they could be anyone only reinforces the idea that they could be us. ""Cat People"" (1942) and ""I Walked With a Zombie"" (1943), both directed by Tourneur, are horror pictures rewritten to resemble 18th-century seduction verse. Their allure is sensual and unnerving, and their visual poetry alone has a velvety lushness: in ""Zombie,"" whispering slivers of light streak through the slatted blinds of a Caribbean mansion, like fingers reaching out in the darkness; in ""Cat People,"" a troubled young wife (Simone Simon, who has the face of a petulant Persian kitten) stares out her window on a moonlit night, shivering not at the thought of what might be out there, but at what might be inside her. This collection includes those two pictures, as well as the seven others Lewton made for RKO (and a biographical documentary). Together they're a treasure chest of skillful shoestring filmmaking, a sterling example of how much you can accomplish with brains and good lighting. The A-list is for unimaginative overachievers; Lewton understood the melancholy joy of being B.

2005-09-12,"Out of the Small Clubs, Into the Big Time","EVER since major jazz labels began to shrink their rosters in the late 90's, the average consumer hasn't really been able to hear what's happening in the small New York clubs. (Maybe contemporary jazz is moving toward a position of having no average consumers, but that's another issue.) Over the last five years, one of the best musicians to make his home in places like Fat Cat and the Up Over Jazz Cafe has been the young pianist Robert Glasper. He has regularly been great, starting out from powerful, precise expositions of theme and then expanding his area of play, always followed closely by his trio. But the grapevine has its limits: unless you're a New York jazz musician, or you hang out with them, you've probably never heard him. ""Canvas,"" which comes out on Oct. 4, is actually his second album, after ""Mood,"" which appeared two years ago on the Spanish label Fresh Sound. The new recording is on the much more visible Blue Note label, and it shows Mr. Glasper doing what he has done, more or less, in those shows, and that is good. There will be time later to build concepts; the main thing is to get a representative sample of his rolling pulse in improvisations, his sputter of ideas within the close watchwork movements of his regular trio, with Vicente Archer on bass and Damion Reid on drums. Mr. Glasper owes a debt to Herbie Hancock, as do most mainstream jazz pianists who came along in the last three decades, and he doesn't hide it in the album's pretty harmonic changes. But laid thickly over any secondary stuff is his own jittery, hip-hop-altered sense of groove. Mr. Glasper's first weeklong residence at a major club in New York -- the Village Vanguard, in fact, which couldn't be better for him -- will finally happen the first week of November.

2005-09-12,Among the Believers,"Benjamin Kunkel's first novel, ""Indecision,"" published last month, concerns a young man living in Manhattan and trying, as the title suggests, to figure out what to do with his life. He has a B.A. in philosophy and an active, if confusing, romantic life; he gets by on a combination of office work and parental subsidy. In his author's affectionate estimation, offered over a beer on a recent evening at a Brooklyn bar, this young man, whose name is Dwight Wilmerding, is ""kind of an idiot."" Perhaps, but he may also be -- the critical response to ""Indecision"" suggests as much -- an especially representative kind of idiot. His plight, after all, is -- for people of his age and background -- a familiar one: an alienation from his own experience brought about by too much knowledge, too many easy, inconsequential choices, too much self-consciousness. Bred in a culture consecrated to the entitled primacy of the individual, he discovers that he lacks a self, a coherent identity, maybe a soul. He feels that he could be anyone. ""It wasn't very unusual for me to lie awake at night,"" he confesses, ""feeling like a scrap of sociology blown into its designated corner of the world. But knowing the clichés are clichés doesn't help you to escape them. You still have to go on experiencing your experience as if no one else has ever done it.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/among-the-believers.html

He strides through the streets of Paris in a fedora and trench coat -- classic garb that screams ""shady character"" to anyone who's paying attention -- and yet even after he has committed murder, the witnesses have trouble picking him out of a police lineup. Mr. Delon's face looks as if it has been emptied, as if it were once able to show feeling but has now forgotten how -- or has simply become terrified at the prospect. He could be the Beatles' ""Nowhere Man,"" except that in his noble passivity, he's almost more feminine than masculine -- he's like an old-fashioned vision of a bride, a woman waiting to be completed, but by what? This restored ""Le Samouraï"" includes archival interviews with Melville and Mr. Delon, as well as a reprinted tribute by John Woo, who has cited ""Le Samouraï"" as his favorite movie. That's no surprise, given that Mr. Woo has always been fascinated by gangster codes of honor and by the glimmers of humanity lurking in seemingly coldblooded killers. But in any lineup of iconic hoods, Mr. Delon stands out. At the end of ""Le Samouraï,"" he's the bride stripped bare, left holding a gun instead of a bouquet. He finally gets what he's been waiting for: his bridegroom is taking him home.

2005-09-12,Also Coming Soon,"Lost in this year's post-Christmas shuffle, the terrific Turkish-German drama ""Head-On"" (Tuesday) is one of those rare gutter romances that don't confuse authenticity with grunginess. The ""children of Marx and Coca-Cola"" finally receive the home video treatment they deserve in Criterion's edition of Jean-Luc Godard's ""Masculin Féminin"" (Sept. 20). Criterion also brings us a new edition of David Bowie in Nicolas Roeg's sci-fi drama ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" (Sept. 27). ""Teorema"" is not where the wind comes sweeping down the plain, but Pier Paolo Pasolini's drama, with Terence Stamp as an enigmatic stranger who seduces each member of a bourgeois household (Oct. 4). ""The Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection"" (Oct. 4) consists of 16 discs, many of them (like ""Vertigo"") proving the title true. ""Rebel Samurai: Sixties Swordplay Classics"" (Oct. 4) collects long-unavailable milestones in Japanese cinema, like ""Samurai Rebellion,"" starring Toshiro Mifune. The seminal noir ""Kiss of Death,"" in which Richard Widmark pushes an old lady in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs, makes its debut on DVD. Charlotte Gainsbourg delivers an exquisite performance in one of this year's best films, ""Happily Ever After"" (Oct. 11), directed by and starring her husband, Yvan Attal. Everyone who loves Johnny Petraglia and movies, rejoice: the Coen brothers' bowling opus, ""The Big Lebowski"" (Oct. 18), gets the deluxe treatment. When did summer movies last give us a potent piece of political filmmaking? They did this summer with George A. Romero's knockout ""Land of the Dead"" (Oct. 25). Warner Brothers continues its stellar reissues of MGM classics with a three-disc edition of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (Oct. 25). Expect lines of geeks to start forming outside video stores right now in anticipation of the Nov. 1 release of ""Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,"" subsection XVIII, paragraph X, etc. The DVD release of Michael Winterbottom's groundbreaking sex-and-music drama ""9 Songs"" (Nov. 8) gives the critics who feigned boredom the first time around the chance to feign it all over again. Jacques Rivette's sun-kissed, extra-sensory and epic meditation on the art of storytelling, ""Celine and Julie Go Boating"" (Nov. 15), comes at last to DVD. ""Ran,"" Akira Kurosawa's pitiless version of ""King Lear,"" arrives from Criterion on Nov. 15. And Dec. 13 brings the DVD debut of Tomás Gutiérrez Alea's fiercely intelligent ""Memories of Underdevelopment,"" which landed the director in hot water in his native Cuba, and the National Society of Film Critics in hot water with our own government when it tried to honor him.

2005-09-12,Comings and Goings,"The Federal Aviation Administration has decided against a proposal to require the use of child safety seats aboard airline flights -- a move that would have forced parents to buy tickets for small children who otherwise could sit in parents' laps. In a statement released by the F.A.A. late last month, Marion C. Blakey, a spokeswoman for the agency, cited safety as the primary concern. ""Statistics show that families are safer traveling in the sky than on the road,"" she said. ""If requiring extra airline tickets forces some families to drive, then we're inadvertently putting too many families at risk."" Starting Nov. 1, air travelers to the Dominican Republic will be asked to pay a $5 tourist fee on arrival. The fee, which the tourism board called temporary, will be part of the cost of airline tickets. The country already charges a $10 tourist-visa fee to visit the island and a $20 departure tax.

Outside, it was blustery and bitterly cold; many of the passes of the White Mountains, of which Tora Bora forms a part, were already blocked by snow. But inside the cave complex, where bin Laden had sought his final refuge from the American war in Afghanistan -- a war in which Washington, that October, had struck back for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- bin Laden munched on olives and sipped sugary mint tea. He was dressed in his signature camouflage jacket, and a Kalashnikov rested by his side. Captured Qaeda fighters, interviewed separately, told American interrogators that they recalled an address that bin Laden had made to his followers shortly before dawn. It concerned martyrdom. American bombs, including a 15,000-pound ""daisy cutter,"" were raining from the sky and pulverizing a number of the Tora Bora caves.

I recall vividly the seconds flowing by as I sat gaping at the screen, uncomprehending and unbelieving, while Peter Jennings's urbane, perfectly modulated voice murmured calmly on about flights being grounded, leaving unacknowledged and unexplained -- unconfirmed -- the incomprehensible scene unfolding in real time before our eyes.

But Reese Witherspoon, set to portray his wife June Carter Cash (opposite Joaquin Phoenix), beseeched Gov. Phil Bredesen to make Tennessee more financially attractive to the producers. When he asked why Ms. Witherspoon was campaigning so hard, her response had nothing to do with the fact that she is a $15 million-a-movie Hollywood star. Sitting in an overstuffed striped chair at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Ms. Witherspoon smoothed the hem of her gauzy Alberta Ferretti dress and acted out her response, narrowing her eyes, pursing her lips and letting her high voice slip into its natural Dixie rhythms.

Hack breaks his no-shopping rule when hanging with Lila Grace, his 3-year-old daughter with Kate Moss. Dad and daughter recently purchased a pair of silver shoes together. ‘‘For me it’s an experience,’’ he says. ‘‘For her it’s a game.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/09/13/jefferson-hack-editor/

2005-09-14,No Heat Doesn't Mean No Sweat,"OCCASIONALLY, even the most carnivorous cooks can find themselves tempted by raw produce. It may seem harebrained to try to one-up vegans by banning from the kitchen not only all animal products, but also all application of heat to any foodstuff, ever. Still, when one has sweated through enough party clothes in enough kitchens, putting the final touches on enough dinner party menus, one may start wondering how much easier a cooking life minus the actual cooking might be. So, fed up with the dry cleaning bills, this confirmed braiser attempted to convert to the uncooked way of life. The first hurdle in a fledgling raw career was outfitting my kitchen and pantry. This might seem simple enough, if you see raw foodism as some kind of pristine 21st century version of noble savagery. But raw food, at least as made by the glamorous authors of a host of recent cookbooks (or as raw foodists might put it, ""cook"" books), is the farthest thing from straight off the vine. Although the movement dictates no animal products and no heat, we're not talking salad here. Raw foodists have much grander ambitions.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/dining/no-heat-doesnt-mean-no-sweat.html

On the WB, ""Gilmore Girls"" began its sixth season -- Luke said yes to Lorelai's marriage proposal (yay), but Lorelai and her daughter Rory still aren't speaking (sob) -- and brought in 6.08 million viewers.

Levine said yesterday that he would step down as president of Teachers College at Columbia University on July 1, after 12 years in the job.

2005-09-16,The Listings: Sept. 16 -- Sept. 22; 'BIRD BRAIN',"It all started five years ago with some pigeons in Brooklyn. Since then, Jennifer Monson has followed the migration patterns of gray whales, ospreys, ducks and geese, presenting free, outdoor site-specific dances, workshops and panels on conservation along the way. On Monday, Ms. Monson gives her first New York performance in more than two years. This Bessie-Award winning choreographer is turning Dance Theater Workshop inside out with ""Bird Brain"" in an effort to create a habitat that offers urbanites a taste of her nature-driven dances. From 6:30 to 7:30 p.m., audience members supplied with building maps can follow a series of ""trails"" through the workshop's theater, past a terrace performance by local students, stairwell happenings and a janitor's closet that has been transformed into a wetland. They will then travel through the dressing room to reach the main theater, where Bob Braine and Leslie Reed have used hundreds of five-gallon buckets full of various plant species to create a movable forest of vegetation for the premiere of ""Flight of Mind"" (above). Four dancers, including Ms. Monson, will perform this contemplative distillation of her ""Bird Brain"" projects, shifting the buckets to invoke different environments in which the nonpresentational, ambient dance will unfold. The composers David Kean and Kenta Nagai will perform Mr. Kean's soundscape of noises, taken from the dancers and the building itself. On Monday night, naturalists, artists and conservationists will take part in ""Moving Ecologies,"" a post-performance discussion of the urban landscape.

Mitt Romney's veto of a bill to make the so-called morning-after pill more widely available. The 176-to-16 vote was widely expected since the measure, which allows some pharmacists to dispense the pill without a prescription and requires hospitals to offer it to rape victims, had passed by veto-proof margins in July. When taken within a few days after sex, the pill, which the Food and Drug Administration considers a contraceptive, can interfere with ovulation or fertilization or can sometimes prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted in the uterus. Mr. Romney, a Republican, said he vetoed the bill because he believed that the pill's ability to prevent implantation meant that it was sometimes used as an abortion pill.

But New York's most populous borough -- with about 2.5 million residents representing more than 90 ethnic groups -- has always been shadowed by its glamorous neighbor across the East River. Thriving a century ago, Brooklyn fell off the map around the time the Dodgers went Hollywood. Now it's back. Over the last decade or so, a new generation of immigrants in search of affordable rents have brought youthful energy to the patchwork of distinctive neighborhoods. Progress, both good and bad, can be seen in strands of new parks that will eventually share space along the waterfront with towering high-rises and a new cruise-ship terminal, and the possibility of a new basketball stadium looms near downtown. A weekend is hardly enough time to take in the borough's many sides, so try to see as much of today's Brooklyn as you can -- while you still can.

2005-09-16,"Paid Notice: Deaths   MALIS, LEONARD I. MD.","MALIS--Leonard I. MD. When the definitive history of neurosurgery is written, a significant portion will be devoted to the contributions of Leonard I. Malis. Dr. Malis was born in Philadelphia in 1919. After receiving a medical degree from the University of Virginia in 1943, he served as captain in the Medical Corps and by the end of WW II was the head of his hospital's neurological unit. After leaving the army, he did his neurosurgical training at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. He completed a fellowship at Yale University and returned to Mount Sinai as an assistant attending neurosurgeon, assuming the chairmanship of the Department of Neurosurgery in 1970. Dr. Malis was a pioneer in microneurosurgery, introducing the operating microscope to neurosurgery in New York. With his brother Jerry, he developed some of the earliest state of the art surgical instruments and techniques which are still in use today. Dr. Malis retired as Chairman of the Mount Sinai Department of Neurosurgery in 1991 but continued as Professor of Neurosurgery until 1994 and as Professor Emeritus until his death. His clinical and academic legacy will enrich the practice of neurosurgery for generations to come. The Department of Neurosurgery at Mount Sinai will miss Dr. Malis as a teacher and colleague, but his presence will be noted in in operating rooms daily. We offer our condolences to his family and many friends. Kalmon D. Post, M.D. Leonard I.

2005-09-16,The Listings: Sept. 16 -- Sept. 22; VISION ARTISTS FOR NEW ORLEANS,"The Vision Festival, a vibrant grass-roots endeavor that marked its 10th season in June, has long been a gravitational center for jazz's far-flung avant-garde. Its focus is social and political as well as aesthetic -- a reflection of the guiding principles of its director, Patricia Nicholson, whose husband, William Parker, is the scene's most prominent bassist. This benefit concert took shape as Ms. Nicholson fielded post-Katrina inquiries about the whereabouts of Edward (Kidd) Jordan, a saxophonist, educator and patriarch of the New Orleans jazz scene who has also been a Vision Festival favorite. (Mr. Jordan had evacuated his house near the 17th Street Canal the night before the levee breach.) Ms. Nicholson wasted little time organizing an evening featuring a roll call of festival-affiliated artists. The resulting line-up will include John Zorn's Masada, featuring the trumpeter Dave Douglas; an expanded incarnation of Mr. Parker's Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra; solo performances by the trumpeter Bill Dixon and the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams; and Vision Festival staples like the poet Amiri Baraka, the pianist Matthew Shipp and the saxophonist Charles Gayle. Mr. Jordan, above, will play in a group with the drummer Clyde Kerr, another displaced New Orleans musician. Even the celebrity interlopers will reflect a downtown disposition: the actor Steve Buscemi shares M.C.-ing duties with Ms. Nicholson and the poet Steve Dalachinsky; Elvis Costello and Deborah Harry reprise their collaboration with the Jazz Passengers; and Yo La Tengo reunites with the free-jazz ensemble Other Dimensions in Music. (Tuesday from 5:30 p.m. to midnight, Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)529-7194; www.visionfestival.org.

The second child of Jack and Mollie Ruderman, he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1920. At an early age he fell in love with chemistry--an affair lasting throughout his life. In 1940 he graduated from City College with a B.S degree. He earned his M.S. at NYU and Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and received a PhD from Columbia University in 1949. He worked cooperatively with other scientists on the Manhattan Project, and continued collaborative scientific research for many more years. He combined his scientific talents with business acumen starting a series of advanced technology research and development corporations. In 1956 he founded Isomet, dedicated to the research and production of acousto-optical devices utilized in laser instrumentation. He left Isomet in 1973 and formed a new corporation, Inrad, again specializing in laser optics. In collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he pioneered the science of creating very large crystals to focus laser light to achieve the extremely high temperatures necessary to generate fusion. After retiring from Inrad in 2000, he started a research company in conjunction with Cornell University to investigate the use of laser light for treatment of vocal cord tumors. His many scientific awards include election as a Fellow in the NY Academy of Science, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, the American Physical Society, the American Chemical Society, and the Optical Society of America. He was awarded 18 U.S. and foreign patents, authored numerous scientific articles and gave invited chemical and physical society lectures in the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan. In 1943 he met his other lifelong love, Carol Schmied, a master's candidate at the Columbia School of Social Work and in 1945 they married. He and Carol raised four children and have 12 grandchildren. They celebrated their 60th anniversary in June of this year. In addition to his scientific achievements he led a balanced life of civic and family interests. He was a trustee of the Demarest Baptist Church. He played tennis with the ""Tenafly Monday Night Irregulars."" He enjoyed travel, gardening, theater, music, and visiting with devoted children and grandchildren. He touched many lives, and those who knew him will always remember his warmth, wit, and intelligence. He is survived by his wife Carol, his children Genevieve, William, Clifford, and Barbara, his sister Florence, and his 12 grandchildren.

The musical, produced with permission of Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, was written and directed by Don Scardino and starred a cast of nine actors, each of whom embodied Lennon at different moments of his life. The show received poor reviews during an out-of-town run this year in San Francisco and didn't fare much better with New York critics after opening at the Broadhurst on Aug. 14. After Labor Day, sales faltered badly, with the show playing to less than 40 percent of capacity last week. The production is expected to lose most of its $7 million capitalization cost.

2005-09-16,'I Am Cuba',"Born in 1903, Mikhail Kalatozov came of creative age in the Soviet film industry in the 1920's, its most heroic period. Although he apparently suffered his share of indignities, he survived well enough to continue making films, earning international plaudits with ""The Cranes Are Flying"" (1957). And so it came to pass that his survival instincts and talent took him to the Caribbean, where soon before Cuba pointed its Soviet missiles at the United States, he set his sights at that tiny island nation. What emerged from this sojourn was ""I Am Cuba"" (1964), above, a black-and-white wonderment that tells the story of the revolution with squealing trumpets, restless drums and astonishing cinematography. It is a story told with everyday heroes laboring in smoky dance halls and dusty fields, and with villains like Batista and the United Fruit Company. Mostly, though, it is a story told with a camera as deliriously liberated as the Cuban people would prove enslaved. Long unseen outside of Cuba and the Soviet Union, it was rediscovered in the early 1990's and subsequently released here to great critical acclaim. Ten years later, fresh prints have been struck with new subtitles and done away with the original Russian overdub. The impulse to strip the translation from the sensuous imagery is understandable, if perhaps unfortunate. What gives ""I Am Cuba"" such resonance, after all, isn't just that camera and those bodies in restless motion, but also the strange convergence of this nominal ideal with that alien accent. In 1962, you imagine, the voice of the Soviet Union reverberated through Havana as loudly as that of Fidel Castro.

2005-09-16,The Listings: Sept. 16 -- Sept. 22; TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP',"Known until now for eclectically layered abstract paintings, Tom Burckhardt has produced a big surprise for his current exhibition: a walk-in cartoon of an artist's studio, above, made of tan corrugated cardboard and black paint. The construction calls to mind Red Grooms's animated environments, but Mr. Burckhardt's humor is quieter and mysteriously somber. Much of the entertainment value is in the transformation of objects into all kinds of cardboard forms, with details added by brush and black paint. The tabletop on saw horses, the crumpled paint tubes, the art postcards tacked to the wall, the art books on the book shelves, the pressed-tin ceiling, the paint-splattered floor: everywhere you look there are details to examine. It is as if a Midas-like character with a cardboard touch had paid a visit. The installation is also a nostalgic comment on the mystique of the modern artist's studio. Mr. Burckhardt has planted art historical references throughout: the brushes in a Savarin coffee can allude to Jasper Johns; the pot-bellied stove is from Edward Hopper's studio; the record player replicates one owned by Willem de Kooning; and the shoes are Jackson Pollock's. An empty canvas stands on the easel, a blank screen waiting to receive the artist's visionary projections. Even if you don't get all the references, you may still have a sense of the studio as a kind of scared anachronism, a place frozen in time as our digital age plunges headlong into the virtual future.

2005-09-19,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WARREN, ROSALIND AMES","WARREN -- Rosalind Ames died peacefully in her home surrounded by family and friends after a courageous battle against cancer. She is survived by beloved husband Eugene, loving daughters Shawn Crowley and Jennifer Medwin, caring sons-in-law Steve Medwin and Bill Crowley, cherished grandchildren Ryan Beres and Jessica Medwin, Catherine and Kiera Crowley, caring best friend Mary O'Brien and devoted friend Jenny Ruff. Roz arrived in New York City from Philadelphia at the age of 16 to begin an extraordinary twenty-three year modeling career. Admired and respected in her industry for honesty, integrity and strong character. Roz was one of the reigning queens of the 50's & 60's on Seventh Avenue. She worked for all of the top designers in her day: Charles James, Halston, Anne Klein, Ben Zuckerman, Geoffrey Beene, Kasper, and Molly Parnis. Charles James insisted that all Saks mannequins be patterned after her figure. Roz was selected by Eleanor Lambert to be the opening and closing model for the prestigious Coty Awards. She was Mr. Goodman's first choice of models at Bergdorf Goodman fashion shows. Roz showed privately for Jacqueline Kennedy and The Duchess of Windsor and was a personal favorite of Lady Bird Johnson. Roz left a lasting impression on those who met her. She had the unique ability to combine style, dignity, and generosity with humanity. Fiercely independent and determined, she was a woman before her time. Many will remember her for the intensity with which she applied herself in various Upper Westside gyms over the years, exercising, spinning, and ultimately daily yoga. She succeeded on her own terms, never compromising her integrity and commanding the respect of those with whom she worked. A discerning judge of character, Roz was a friend for life for those lucky and deserving people who she chose to embrace. At the same time, Roz always had a special place for those less fortunate than her, and her love of animals was profound--not only the lucky animals who shared her home over the years, but also the many dogs she knew by name in the park. Even in the midst of her struggle with cancer, she would gather the strength to walk to Central Park to feed the birds. Roz will be deeply missed by all her family and friends. She will remain in our hearts forever. Funeral services will be held at The Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) at 11:30 AM on Sunday, September 18th. Donations in her mamory may be made to the ASPCA, Hospice of New York, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer (Thoracic Oncology Department).",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/classified/paid-notice-deaths-warren-rosalind-ames.html

""The middle seat is gone,"" cheered Maxine Marshall, who commutes from Plainfield to Jersey City. Well, it is not gone yet. The gleaming vehicle, unveiled at Newark Penn Station, was a prototype of New Jersey Transit's first bilevel passenger car, which will not be in service for at least a year. There are only two seats on each side of the aisle. The railroad plans to start running the first batch of 100 cars in late 2006 to ease crowding on its trains into and out of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. Those trains are rapidly approaching full capacity during rush hours. The most comfortable way to squeeze more people onto each train is to add a second level, said Jack Lettiere, the state's transportation commissioner and chairman of New Jersey Transit. A typical 10-car train will have 1,375 seats, or about 225 more than on a comparable train today.

It rotates one revolution a minute, counteracting the effects of gravity and movement on accuracy. Blancpain's 1735 model has every bell and whistle and costs $779,000. Patek Philippe's Minute Repeater Tourbillon clocks in at a cool half-million. Comparatively speaking, the Breguet Skeleton Tourbillon (pictured here) is a bargain at $122,900. So, why not wear your complexity on (or near) your sleeve? SANDRA BALLENTINE",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/magazine/style/the-remix-time-is-money.html

2005-09-19,Rough Rider,"I see a lot of clothes that pretend to have a history: jeans that have been sanded and scrubbed by some guy in Long Beach, Calif., to make them look as if they have a past; T-shirts that have been ripped and repaired, as if they've suffered. But my motorcycle jacket -- a black leather Belstaff Montana jacket with a snap-down touring collar, to be exact -- has lived more, seen more, survived more, than I have. In the early 1950's, Che Guevara wore a Belstaff on the motorcycle trip through Latin America that turned him into a radical. Belstaff outfitted T.E. Lawrence for his travels in Arabia, Steve McQueen for the movies and the pioneering aviators of the 1930's for unknown adventures. These days, even the Dalai Lama wears one. As a writer, my work has taken me through the alleys of Cairo, floods in Rangoon and the back streets of Rio. I've also shot photographs in the sand dunes of the Sahara and on the peaks of the Himalayas. I don't have time to change with the fashions, and I don't have space for fussy, complicated clothes. I need classics that will be with me forever. I like clothes in which I can see the desert in a crease at the elbow or Highway 1 in Vietnam in a scuff on the shoulder. I don't mind if my clothes look worn or beaten up, as long as they are real and well made. I don't want somebody else living for me; that, I can do myself. George Clooney, a serious biker and Belstaff fanatic, calls his jacket ""classic and cool, the perfect combination between tradition and innovation.""

2005-09-19,Fiction Chronicle,"WOUNDED. By Percival Everett. (Graywolf, $23.) An appealing air of menace hangs over the action in Everett's latest novel, a modern-day western where the cowboys and Indians get along and the real threat comes from the neo-Nazis in the hills. The narrator is John Hunt, a laconic black horse trainer in Wyoming, whose natural reticence has grown more pronounced since his wife's death in an equestrian accident: now John's only regular social contact is with the ex-con uncle who lives on his ranch. But as much as John wants to mind his own business, he's confronted by bigotry and its consequences when a ranch hand is accused of killing a young gay man -- the victim, like Matthew Shepard, ""strung up like an elk with his throat slit."" This isn't a mystery, and the murder quickly recedes from the story, but not before setting in motion a chain of events that leaves John fearing for his own safety and questioning the sexual and racial politics of just about everybody he knows. Like more traditional westerns, ""Wounded"" isn't big on psychological depth -- the villains might as well twirl handlebar mustaches -- and Everett has abandoned the madcap humor he favored in earlier books, but his acerbic intelligence remains on display, and the result is an unsettling look at intolerance and its logical end in violence. ""There are plenty of stupid, narrow-minded people around,"" John tells a visitor. ""They're not hard to find. There are a lot of ignorant people, a lot of good, smart people. Is it different where you come from?""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

The Supreme Court broods over the placement of the Ten Commandments.

On September 6, 1970, two airplanes, one from Swissair and the other from TWA, were hijacked and forced to land at the so-called ""Revolutionary"" airport, a disused military facility at Zarqa, in Jordan. Three days later, a British plane was diverted to this same airport. Once the passengers were let go, two Palestinian terrorists, Wadi Haddad and Layla Khalid, blew up the cabins. This first dramatic gesture on the part of the PFLP triggered the onset of Black September, the fierce repression undertaken by King Hussein against the Palestinian fedayeen who had taken refuge in Jordan.

One example of what has changed, and what hasn't, is the Web site FatWallet.com. Founded in 1999 as a hobby by a Web developer named Tim Storm, it now has 370,000 registered users and about 30 employees. FatWallet performs three functions. As an ""affiliate"" of various online retailers (including Staples, Dell and Target), it earns a small commission on sales it makes through its site, which it splits with its users in a ""cash back"" program. It also has an area where online coupons and special sales are announced. But the most interesting -- and potentially subversive -- thing is the forums section. There, consumers themselves have tracked down bargains and decided to share them with others. Some of these users are definitely ""deal-hunting addicts,"" Storm says, and their forum interactions are ""the heartbeat of the site.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-91805-consumed-collective-bargain-hunting.html

Graphic novels, including manga, have been popular with American boys for years now. But, to the surprise of publishers, ""shojo"" comics (or manga for girls) have become one of the hottest markets in the book business. Two publishers -- Viz Media, which is Japanese-owned, and Tokyopop, an American company -- have been the leaders in the American manga market, which has more than doubled since 2002, helped along by a $5 billion business in related animated films, TV series and licensed products like dolls and action figures. Del Rey, in the Random House Publishing Group, has become the first New York publisher to enter the shojo market in a big way (in partnership with Kodansha in Japan). Last year, Del Rey sold a million copies of its first 16 releases combined.

But the moment rock 'n' roll started to cut its teeth on popular culture was the moment when every James Dean look-alike danced with an adolescent girl dressed head to toe in crinoline skirts and padded bras: the Hollywood High version of the New Look. That look, meanwhile, found a rival in the birth of prêt-à-porter by Dior's successor, Yves Saint Laurent. It was the dawn of the 60's, and youth stopped imitating its elders and took on an identity of its own, taking over and changing fashion forever.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/style/tmagazine/the-great-rock-n-roll-swindle.html

In 1843, as Miller fell ill with dropsy, he sold the land and his slaves to Hugh Lucas, settling for nine promissory notes of $3,000 each, to be paid yearly. In April 1844, Miller, who was in declining health, left Louisiana with Patsy for St. Louis, Missouri. Before leaving, Miller gave the promissory notes to William Kirk, asking him to ""keep them for Patsy's benefit"" since ""he intended to have her emancipated, and that he wanted the notes to enure to her benefit"" (Cole v. Lucas, 2 La. Ann. 1946, 1948 (1847)). The previous year, Miller had granted Kirk power of attorney, authorizing him to emancipate Patsy.

She is survived by beloved husband Eugene, loving daughters Shawn Crowley and Jennifer Medwin, caring sons-in-law Steve Medwin and Bill Crowley, cherished grandchildren Ryan Beres and Jessica Medwin, Catherine and Kiera Crowley, caring best friend Mary O'Brien and devoted friend Jenny Ruff. Roz arrived in New York City from Philadelphia at the age of 16 to begin an extraordinary twenty-three year modeling career. Admired and respected in her industry for honesty, integrity and strong character. Roz was one of the reigning queens of the 50's & 60's on Seventh Avenue. She worked for all of the top designers in her day: Charles James, Halston, Anne Klein, Ben Zuckerman, Geoffrey Beene, Kasper, and Molly Parnis. Charles James insisted that all Saks mannequins be patterned after her figure. Roz was selected by Eleanor Lambert to be the opening and closing model for the prestigious Coty Awards. She was Mr. Goodman's first choice of models at Bergdorf Goodman fashion shows. Roz showed privately for Jacqueline Kennedy and The Duchess of Windsor and was a personal favorite of Lady Bird Johnson. Roz left a lasting impression on those who met her. She had the unique ability to combine style, dignity, and generosity with humanity. Fiercely independent and determined, she was a woman before her time. Many will remember her for the intensity with which she applied herself in various Upper Westside gyms over the years, exercising, spinning, and ultimately daily yoga. She succeeded on her own terms, never compromising her integrity and commanding the respect of those with whom she worked. A discerning judge of character, Roz was a friend for life for those lucky and deserving people who she chose to embrace. At the same time, Roz always had a special place for those less fortunate than her, and her love of animals was profound--not only the lucky animals who shared her home over the years, but also the many dogs she knew by name in the park. Even in the midst of her struggle with cancer, she would gather the strength to walk to Central Park to feed the birds. Roz will be deeply missed by all her family and friends. She will remain in our hearts forever. Funeral services will be held at The Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) at 11:30 AM on Sunday, September 18th. Donations in her mamory may be made to the ASPCA, Hospice of New York, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer (Thoracic Oncology Department).",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/classified/paid-notice-deaths-warren-rosalind-ames.html

Schlesinger first encountered Niebuhr at Harvard University's Memorial Church in the winter of 1940-41. He was 23; Niebuhr was 48. It was a time of heated political debate between internationalists and isolationists. ""The last thing I felt I needed was a dose of evangelical religion,"" Schlesinger recently recalled. But Niebuhr, probably the period's best-known theologian, spoke with passion, and his eloquence swept Schlesinger away. ""I came to understand that original sin, a proposition I was prepared to accept not as revealed truth but as powerful metaphor, undermined absolutist pretensions and set sharp limits on human wisdom and aspiration,"" Schlesinger said. Before long, the two men had become close friends and firm political allies through the Americans for Democratic Action, the most influential organization of anti-Communist liberals in the 1950's and early 60's.

2005-09-19,The Remix; VANITY PRESS - GROW YOUR OWN GRAPES,"Producing a cult cabernet requires a sizable outlay of time and money. But thanks to a new invitation-only club in Napa, Calif., 375 wine lovers can become part-time vintners. The Napa Valley Reserve, located on about 80 acres of prime growing land, is the pet project of H. William Harlan, the proprietor of Harlan Estate (a bottle of its 2001 Napa Valley red recently went for $750 at auction). It operates on the same principle as, say, a private golf club: for an initiation deposit of about $150,000, members get a nonequity stake in the estate and the chance to make their own boutique blend under the auspices of the label's winemaking team. The degree of involvement is up to the individual: you can visit your vines once a week or once a year, and you can opt to learn the whole vine-to-wine process or just collect your case allotment (up to 75) of prized juice each year. And, of course, what you put on the label is up to you. SANDRA BALLENTINE",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/magazine/style/the-remix-vanity-press-grow-your-own-grapes.html

2005-09-19,Inside the List,"MASON-DIXON: In a week when the death toll of the horrific Gulf Coast flood continued to rise, a new Civil War title arrived at No. 10 on the fiction list: ""The Widow of the South,"" by the first-time novelist Robert Hicks, a music publisher and manager in Nashville. It's the fictional story of the real-life Carrie McGavock, who turned her Tennessee plantation house into a makeshift hospital for Confederate soldiers after the bloody Battle of Franklin in 1864, which left nearly 2,000 dead. McGavock had almost 1,500 of the bodies buried in her own private cemetery on the Carnton plantation, hence her nickname. In spite of some negative reviews, the book has been selling briskly, and Warner Books set its print run at 250,000. The novel is featured by the Military Book Club and the American Compass Book Club, a conservative mail-order outfit, and it has also received a lot of attention in the Southern press. The Tennessean speculated it might do for the Carnton plantation what ""Gone With the Wind"" did for Atlanta: increase tourism. ""The house itself was used as a makeshift hospital, and bloodstains are clearly visible on the floors upstairs,"" The Tennessean advised would-be visitors. ""There are those who think this residence is home to spirits, some more civil than others. The grounds are lovely and well worth a leisurely stroll.""

At the time, he was the interior minister and controlled the country's spy and security forces.

Sitting at the feet of Bayard Rustin when she was 17, and later, under the tutelage of Albert Shanker, she learned about justice, civil rights, organizing, protests and, most of all, how improving public education can be a major force for social change. She pioneered a legion of programs such as Dial-A-Teacher and Teacher Centers to help students and teachers alike. Since February 2004, when Sandy found out she had a relapse, she fought mightily--as mightly as she always fought to help make a difference in our lives, and in the lives of the thousands of people we represent and the hundreds of thousands of children and others we serve. Those who knew her well know how hard she worked and how much she sacrificed so others would have social justice and economic opportunity. She was a giant and will be hugely missed.

Nielsen's preliminary estimates for the live show indicated that 18.6 million viewers watched. Last year's program brought in only 13.8 million. CBS easily won the night in all key demographics. Friday's lineup featured the debuts of two new series. CBS's ""Threshold"" was the first of the networks' fall science-fiction series to have its premiere, and the results were mixed. It drew 8.42 million viewers and won among the 18-to-49 group but was not strong enough to bring the network a victory for the night among total viewers. NBC was No. 1 in that category, with a two-hour ""Dateline"" and a repeat of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.""

CBS placed second in Nielsen's estimates, but its overall schedule was down in comparison with last year, when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" anchored the 9 p.m. hour. ""Two and a Half Men,"" now in that ""Raymond"" slot, drew 15.23 million viewers; one year ago, ""Raymond"" brought in more (17.99 million). In the new lineup, the debut of the series ""How I Met Your Mother"" delivered an audience of 10.65 million, and that of ""Out of Practice"" 13.39 million. And though ""CSI: Miami"" was significantly down from its 2004 premiere, it was the most-watched program of the night, with 18.61 million viewers. Against heavy competition, NBC was the No.3 network, with solid sampling of its three one-hour shows. The premiere of ""Surface,"" which features inscrutable sea creatures, attracted 10.9 million viewers and beat CBS in the 8 p.m. hour among 18-to-49-year-olds. ""Las Vegas"" (12.41 million) and ""Medium"" (12.45 million) also held up well for NBC. But the news for Fox was not good. Though ""Prison Break"" continued to perform well, with 7.81 million viewers, the premiere of ""Kitchen Confidential"" brought in only 4.32 million.

The subject may be arms dealing in Liberia, as in the new Nicolas Cage movie, ""Lord of War""; big, bad drug companies in Kenya, as in the current ""Constant Gardener ""; or the dictatorship of the fictional not-quite-Zimbabwe that Nicole Kidman's character flees in the recent flop ""The Interpreter."" But the common strategy in these and several other films is to take a hot-button African issue and spin it into easy-to-swallow entertainment. Fleeing from the truly political and divisive ground of ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" these movies begin with safe opinions, then sugar-coat them.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/movies/turning-african-danger-into-safe-entertainment.html

Babbie of the New York Public Interest Research Group said the cap could have the ""perverse effect"" of increasing demand.

A proud Bronx native, he retired to Boca Raton, Florida where he pursued a ""slice-free"" golf drive as avidly as he worked throughout his career. He enjoyed tennis, poker, hearts. He also enjoyed the multitude of wonderful people he met wherever he went. Always kind, helpful, polite and levelheaded, he was admired by most everyone he came in contact with. His humor and sense of fun are things that people will always remember about him. Above all, he was a gentleman.

Along with the debut of the seventh season of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" which brought in an audience of 16.35 million, ""Earl"" helped carry the night for NBC in total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic. Sandwiched between those shows, ""The Office"" posted disappointing results, with 9.16 million viewers and a 33 percent decline from ""Earl's"" 18-to-49 rating. Elsewhere in the morass of network premieres, CBS's ""NCIS"" attracted 14.69 million viewers (good), and ABC's ""According to Jim"" drew 7.88 million (not so good). CBS also featured two finales of its summer reality offerings, ""Big Brother"" (8.46 million) and ""Rock Star: INXS"" (7.9 million), for a third place finish in total viewers and 18-to-49-year-olds; Fox was No. 2 in those categories.

It's one of those rare places that's both open to outsiders and deeply protective of itself. From Point Reyes Station, the tiny town that sits outside the park's eastern edge, an unscathed landscape stretches out in marshes, tide pools and old pine forests, in pristine beaches and pastures broken at the ocean by granite bluffs. Unlike neighboring Bolinas, where residents tear down street signs to deter tourists, Point Reyes has no airs of exclusivity. Hiking, horseback riding, kayaking and clamming are just some of the activities that attract day-trippers, as well as checking out restaurants and browsing bookstores. Every year, hundreds of bird species pass through, as do more than two million people - a fitting mix for a place that lies beneath the Pacific Flyway, a great artery of aerial migration, and on Highway 1.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/travel/escapes/36-hours-in-point-reyes-calif.html

2005-09-23,The Listings: Sept. 23-Sept. 29; THE WHITE STRIPES,"With his rusty holler, old-timey leanings and relentless lone-guitar attack, Jack White, above, has established himself over the last five years as the retro-rock bandleader to beat. But the White Stripes's latest album, ""Get Behind Me Satan"" (V2), reveals the falsetto-screeching frontman's country blues shtick to be more versatile than he'd previously let on. The first single, ""Blue Orchid,"" seemed to aim for the straightforward appeal of the band's previous rockers, like ""Seven Nation Army."" But the balance of Mr. White's new songs veer off in poppier directions. Over the reliable cymbal smashes laid down by the drummer (and his ex-wife), Meg White, he now displays previously undisclosed piano chops. And on numbers like the strutting ""My Doorbell,"" he even sprinkles some funk. The psychedelic-pop-tinged ""Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)"" suggests 70's confections without letting up on the band's trademark surly stomp. The album's title doesn't make it clear whether the White Stripes are recruiting the Devil or shoving him aside. But judging by the dark view of romance expressed on ominous tunes like the marimba-driven ""Nurse"" and the cabaret-country ""I'm Lonely (but I Ain't That Lonely Yet),"" the recruitment seems more likely. Still, the sing-along ""Little Ghost"" provides some lighthearted graveyard humor with its jug-band plea for a pretty phantom to ""scare me up a little bit of love."" The opening act is the indie rockers the Shins, who may not ""change your life,"" as Natalie Portman's character in the movie ""Garden State"" promised, though their ethereal pop has been known to alter an evening or two for the better.

Just kidding. Wednesday's season premiere of the Emmy-winning drama produced even more intriguing questions than it answered, and it drew a large audience of 23.09 million, and a dominant share of 18-to-49-year-olds. ABC easily won both total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic in Nielsen's estimates. ""Lost"" also helped the debut of ""Invasion"" win the 10 p.m. hour, with 16.88 million viewers. NBC's opener of ""Law & Order's"" 16th year also did well in that time slot, with 13.11 million viewers. But the network's other debuts earlier in the evening were weaker: ""E-Ring"" delivered an audience of 9.39 million, and ""The Apprentice: Martha Stewart"" performed surprisingly poorly, attracting only 7.65 million. On UPN, ""America's Top Model"" was back, with 4.72 million viewers, and a second-place finish for the night among women 18 to 34, one of its target demographics. And finally, CBS also featured two season premieres, ""Still Standing"" (7.03 million) and ""Yes, Dear"" (7.37 million).

2005-09-23,The Listings: Sept. 23-Sept. 29; MATTHEW MORRISON,"Because of certain genetic disadvantages -- a square jaw, muscular build and a gleaming white smile -- Matthew Morrison is doomed to play the sort of romantic leading men who show up for a ballad or two in every Broadway musical and are inevitably upstaged by the more tortured and less attractive star. Being handsome, believe it or not, has its drawbacks, although Mr. Morrison, the Broadway heartthrob of the moment, has so far made the most of it. He burst on the scene in ""Hairspray,"" playing Link Larkin, a hip-swiveling singer whom every teenage girl swoons over. Three years later, he was once again the object of lust, but in a more challenging role as the Italian hunk in ""The Light in the Piazza."" This Tony-nominated turn showed off his vocal and acting range as well as his strutting charm, and made people think that he might be more than just a pretty face. Now comes the real test, when Mr. Morrison makes his straight-play debut in Richard Greenberg's ""Naked Girl on the Appian Way,"" a frothy comedy in which the author of ""Take Me Out"" seems to be channeling his inner Neil Simon. Playing a good-looking (of course) and somewhat slow adoptee oblivious to any of life's troublesome complications, Mr. Morrison (above, with Jill Clayburgh) delivers some of the show's funniest lines with the athletic ease that is his trademark. At one point, his character, somewhat randomly, says that he always imagined that his real parents were gymnasts, whom he describes without a trace of irony or mean-spiritedness as ""these really nice, smiley thin people who were just always springing."" Moments later, he bounds offstage with a leap, making you actually believe that it could be true. (American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.)

2005-09-23,The Listings: Sept. 23-Sept. 29; JOHN COLTRANE'S 79TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,"The legacy of John Coltrane, above, has not suffered in the nearly four decades since his death. But this year has been more salutary than most, thanks to two newly unearthed live recordings: a 1957 Carnegie Hall concert with Thelonious Monk (issued late last month on Blue Note) and a pair of 1965 quartet sets at the Half Note (due in mid-October on Verve). Coltrane, who would have been 79 today, was not only a titan of the tenor and soprano saxophones, but also one of jazz's great paradigm-shifters; the most remarkable thing about the new albums is that each captures him in transition. It's fitting, then, that this weekend offers several birthday tributes, each pointing toward a different phase of his career. At Birdland, the spotlight is on Joe Lovano, a saxophonist indebted to the hard-charging, elliptical logic of Coltrane's late-1950's style; also on hand is a superb rhythm section consisting of Steve Kuhn on piano, Lonnie Plaxico on bass and Andrew Cyrille on drums. The Stone welcomes Rashied Ali, the fiery drummer who joined Coltrane's group a handful of months after the Half Note sessions; he offers testimony to Coltrane's questing late period, along with the bassist Reggie Workman (another former Coltrane bandmate), the trumpeter Roy Campbell, the saxophonist Louie Belogenis and the pianist Andrew Bemkey. And at the Cornelia Street Café, George Garzone, whose exploratory tenor playing probably hews closest to the Half Note era itself, joins Joe Cohen on guitar, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Pete Zimmer on drums; as a bonus, it's Mr. Garzone's birthday, too. (Joe Lovano plays tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11, Birdland , 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

2005-09-23,The Listings: Sept. 23-Sept. 29; JEANINE DURNING,"Ms. Durning looked like a wren commandeering gale-force winds in her 2003 ""Part One Parting."" But she inspired trust -- just grab a few pinfeathers and go along for the ride. An analogous faith was necessary to enter the fraught worlds of several mysterious women in a program of Ms. Durning's choreography five years earlier. And her 1996 ""Solo With Armour"" had a similarly enticing inscrutability. Ms. Durning's new multimedia ""out of the kennel into a home"" (above) -- with music by Jules Maxwell, text by Keith Reddin and video by Jason Akira Somma -- sounds like her latest exploration of unchartable provinces of the mind and heart. This evening-long piece, inspired by the memoirs of escape artists and prisoners, burrows into the nature of mental and physical confinement. It takes the theme literally enough to push off the stage and into the street and a truck that is parked there. One of the great pleasures of Ms. Durning's dances is her own faith in the power of unassuming emotionally (and physically) propulsive movement to express quite complex notions. She has performed with David Dorfman and Lance Gries, two modern-dance choreographers who understand how powerfully eloquent pure movement can be. Ms. Durning adds a distinctively female lack of adornment to the mix, in dances that have grown steadily more authoritative and thought-provoking over the 15 years she has been at it. The latest dance looks like quite a departure from the past, but it is hard to imagine that her distinctive, if quiet, voice will not come through. (Ms. Durning and her dancers will perform Wednesday through Oct. 1 at 7:30 p.m. at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077.)

The growth of the nonstop, worldwide festival circuit has made New York both more and less special. Most of the movies the festival shows have been seen elsewhere, and will open theatrically (at least in New York) before too long. But the fact that they have been curated by a committee of eminent critics confers undeniable cachet, and the absence of prizes and the din of deal-making give it an air of decorum and seriousness.

Dr. Manganelli was born on January 15, 1921, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Louis and Concettina Manganelli. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth, N.J., and then earned a B.S. degree from The Ohio State University. He married Filomena Rotolo on June 17, 1945; they recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary with their family. After working at the Schering Corporation, he went on to have a distinguished 57 - year career at Rutgers University as a Professor and later as a Professor Emeritus. Dr. Manganelli received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Science at Rutgers, and became a pioneer, an educator, and an innovator in the fields of Air, Water, and Noise Pollution Studies. He was in the forefront in developing cutting-edge environmental education programs and in performing and publishing state-of-the-art research, and had the unique ability and distinguished record of successfully predicting where the demand for information and instruction would develop. There are many examples of his pioneering efforts. In the early 1950's, he was the first in the United States to develop a Graduate level Air Pollution Training Program. He was a pioneer and an early innovator in the study of noise pollution as it relates to health in the workplace. Many of the most prominent professionals in the United States working in the Environmental field from 1950 to the present were students of Dr. Manganelli. Dr. Manganelli was appointed to the New Jersey Clean Air Council by every Governor for the last 40 years, and served for the entire time as a Council member and for a time as its Chair. He has received numerous honors, awards, and citations for this service and for his distinguished accomplishments and service to many professional organizations, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency; the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; the Air, the Water, and the Noise Pollution Control Associations; the American Industrial Hygiene Association; and Rutgers University. Dr. Manganelli's devotion to teaching and advising generations of undergraduate and graduate students earned him numerous teaching awards and led to the formation of several scholarships in his name, among them the Raymond M. Manganelli Scholarship awarded each year since 1992 at Rutgers University. Dr. Manganelli led a life characterized by a colleague at Rutgers as ""remarkably balanced."" His passions included his family, Rutgers, Civil War history, 6mile-per-day jogging, educational and environmental issues, things Italian, and Ohio State football. Dr. Manganelli was an active member of Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church of Union, N.J. He is survived by Filomena, his beloved wife of 60 years; son and daughter-in-law, Dr. Raymond L. and Cathy Manganelli of Manhasset, N.Y.; daughter and son-in-law, Alida and Larry Karas of Hillside, N.J.; four grandchildren, Thomas and Christopher Manganelli, and Michael and Nicole Karas; a brother, Michael Manganelli; and sisters, Emily Davis and Dorothy Sutherland, and their families, as well as the family of his late sister, Margarita King. The Funeral will be from McCracken Funeral Home, 1500 Morris Avenue, Union, on Monday at 8:30am.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting a 43 cent-per-share profit when Alcoa announces financial results on Oct. 10. Alcoa blamed lower aluminum prices and higher costs, particularly in energy and raw materials. Seasonal weakness in Europe and automotive markets also hurt business. Alcoa also said Hurricane Rita's impact would hurt third-quarter results.

They have also frequently vacationed there, spending two weeks every summer de-stressing on the secluded island of Stromboli and dancing under the mirrored balls in the bustling resort town of Taormina.

2005-09-26,The Classicist,"This past June in New York, in the days before he was presented with the award for international designer of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (C.F.D.A.), the fashion world's equivalent of an Oscar for Best Picture, Alber Elbaz was not rejoicing. The award was a validation of sorts, a long-overdue acknowledgment of his talent and the work he had done since 2002 at Lanvin, the long-moribund French couture house that he has rejuvenated. But the attention and accolades, though welcome, made Elbaz both giddy and anxious. The giddiness was largely for show, a part of the cuddly, jovial image that Elbaz puts forth, especially in social situations. He is a small, round man, and he nearly always wears a black suit with trousers that are much too short, a silk bow tie knotted loosely at his throat and black rectangular glasses that set off the softness of his face. Elbaz understands the power of fashion, how clothes can create a personality, real or otherwise. This gift for artifice extends to his own sartorial choices. While he appears to be playful and a bit theatrical (and he can be), Elbaz is mostly thoughtful and distinctly aware of the vagaries of his chosen business. Now 44, he has worked in fashion for nearly 20 years, including, for 2 of them, as the chief designer of women's wear at Yves St. Laurent, and he knows that being chosen by a group like the C.F.D.A. means that you will, inevitably, be discarded in favor of another. ""Being a designer is not about being a star -- I didn't work for the eight seconds when you get a prize,"" Elbaz told me over lunch at Chanterelle in TriBeCa the day before the awards ceremony. ""For me, there is nothing scarier than being of the moment. Because the moment ends.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/the-classicist.html

Hitchcock showcases the swankiest dwellings in New York and the Caribbean as backdrops to her second suspense novel featuring Jo Slater, a wealthy woman who's been both the toast and the roast of Manhattan. When Jo's friend Russell Cole goes missing from his yacht in Barbados, New York society converges on the island to entertain his shady but glamorous would-be widow. Family members attribute Russell's absence to ""something called Dissociative Fugue Disorder,"" a straight-out-of-a-soap-opera form of amnesia that causes him to wander from home and temporarily lose his identity. But Jo and her friend Larry, a novelist who writes about ""low crime in high places,"" aren't so sure. Soon after the widow tells Jo they're ""sisters under the skin"" (which creeps Jo out considerably), people start to die.

2005-09-26,‘Melville’," He was born on August 1, 1819, into good circumstances. But his parents lacked the money to stay there, and so they turned, at no small cost to their dignity, to their elders for help. On his mother's side, the benefactor was Maria's father, Peter Gansevoort, a towering man (six foot three in an age when six-footers were rare) famous for having commanded the defense of Fort Stanwix, an outpost guarding the trade route from the Great Lakes, during the British siege of 1777. There is a tendency today to think of the Revolutionary War as a dispute among bewigged gentlemen who sent men into battle with inaccurate guns to the martial music of fife and drum; in fact, it was a brutal war whose combatants literally tasted sweat and blood flung from the bodies of their enemies as they slashed at each other with bayonets. It was not uncommon for wounded soldiers to be stabbed through and left to bleed to death ""like sieves,"" or to have their brains dashed out with ""barbarity to the utmost"" by the musket butts of the advancing enemy. Melville was to write about this war in the novel Israel Potter, in which he described the Yankee defenders at Bunker Hill gripping their muskets by the barrel and beating back the British assault by ""wielding the stock right and left, as seal-hunters on the beach, knock down with their clubs the Shetland seal.""

Driven by the hokiest of plot contrivances -- the need to come up with $35,000 to send his adopted daughter to a Swiss clinic for the treatment of a rare blood disease -- Easy almost allows himself to be recruited for an armed robbery masterminded by his best friend, Raymond (Mouse) Alexander. But there's no real danger of that kind of backsliding from Easy, who has come a long way since 1948, when he returned from World War II (in ""Devil in a Blue Dress"") to find himself, along with the rest of his friends from the old neighborhood, at a moral crossroads. Unlike the entrepreneurial Mouse, who took up crime for the status, power and wealth denied him by a racist society, Easy plays mainly, if not exclusively, by the rules, a brave choice for ""a black man in a country that seemed to be teetering on the edge of a race war."" By 1966, when ""Cinnamon Kiss"" takes place, he has too much at stake -- an honest job, a loving woman and children, the respect of his community -- to blow it all on some risky criminal enterprise.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/books/review/haight-crime.html

If you haven't already seen the movie, it will spoil nothing to tell you that the accident, discreetly shown as a ""Six Feet Under""-style whiteout, is not fatal. After all, what romantic comedy in its right mind would kill off Reese Witherspoon in the first act? And ""Just Like Heaven,"" which opened last weekend to a solid $16.5 million box-office take is, in more than one sense, a movie very much in its right mind.

""We have had many opportunities to expand, which we have always resisted,"" says Catharina Hedberg, the upbeat Swedish co-owner. During a test run in Sóller, Majorca, the first two months were booked in five days, she says, ""so we decided to stay."" The grueling Ashram formula (roughly 1,200-calorie vegetarian menus, rigorous uphill hikes and no more than 13 guests a week, who pay on average $550 a day to share rustic accommodations) hasn't changed, although, according to Hedberg, ""we added some sea kayaking, and the last night's special meal is vegetarian paella.""

2005-09-26,Tree Stumped,"A hike through the pygmy forests of Northern California, where the century-old trees can be a foot and a half tall, is enough to argue the case for Lilliputian travel. Why suffer the pomp and bloat of resort culture when you can be a towering presence in the serene woodlands off the Mendocino coast? ""It looks like a munchkin forest,"" says Renee Pasquinellian, an ecologist with the State Parks office, who compares the phenomenon, which occurs naturally, with bonsai trees, which are stunted by man. But there is mystery surrounding this anomaly. ""No one has figured it out,"" says Teresa Sholars, a professor at the College of the Redwoods. It's believed that the very poor quality of the soil, due to extreme age and lack of nutrients, makes pygmies out of trees that would grow tall elsewhere. With its elevated boardwalk, Van Damme State Park offers the best vantage from which to puzzle over the pygmy canopy. The more remote, less trafficked pygmy forest at the Jug Handle State Reserve requires a several-mile hike up the Ecological Staircase Trail, which begins on a grassy coastal bluff with an ocean view and leads through a dramatic transition from redwoods to the little guys.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/the-remix-tree-stumped.html

The athletic hoodies for men and women are made of nylon and polyethylene. Imagine scuba suits fused with Tyvek Fed Ex envelope paper with a hint of Lycra thrown in. The result: a resilient bi-stretch fabric with admirable thermal and wicking qualities, fray-proof raw edges and the ability to keep body temperature at a constant state of comfort. In addition, the hoodie's waist pockets are made from antimicrobial material and the inner chest cellphone pocket is constructed of antiradiation fabric. Oh, and it looks nice, too. Available in gray, indigo, mauve and black heather; $320 for women's, $370 for men at DDC Lab in New York, (212)414-5801.

2005-09-26,Color My World,"When I travel, I always take my Winsor & Newton watercolor kit, which is the size of a pack of cigarettes when folded up. I bought my first one in the 1980's. It was handy to bring on trips, and I packed it into a leather pouch along with a couple of brushes, a pencil, an eraser and paper. At the time, I was filling notebooks the size of credit cards with tiny pictures. The notebooks have become a little bigger, but the kit is still the same. Its plastic hinge is now cracked and held together with duct tape, and I have a backup set that stays open on my desk. Painting keeps me occupied in those moments when travel can be aimless and even disorienting. Mainly it is a way to register at least some of the new impressions of a foreign place, when its thrilling barrage can sometimes overwhelm you. Recording a scene with paint rather than film sinks you more deeply into your surroundings. You have to look a little harder and a little longer. And you end up with a memento. When I look through my sketchbooks, they bring back moments that I would otherwise have completely forgotten. Most of my watercolors are done quickly -- out the window of a train in the Tsavo desert; through the windshield of a car driving through a Wyoming blizzard; before the sunbathing subject gets up to take a swim. Sometimes I have longer to look and time to kill -- peering out an airplane window while trying to render the grid on the ground as we circle before landing; sleepless in a hotel room in Omaha; on the shore in Maine, where I know I've been a long time when I notice how far the shade under that granite rock has traveled.

2005-09-26,Up Front,"IN his review of Jonathan Kozol's latest book, ""The Shame of the Nation,"" beginning on Page 12, Nathan Glazer indicates his sympathy for Kozol's idealism, his goals of integration and greater equality, but questions how we get from here to there, indeed whether it's even possible. It's a classic Glazer performance. For decades now, he has busied himself with removing the stars from the eyes of idealists, awakening well-intentioned dreamers to morning-after realities. An early editor of Commentary magazine; for 30 years the editor, with Irving Kristol, of The Public Interest; the author of such books as ""Affirmative Discrimination"" and ""The Limits of Social Policy,"" Glazer has often been labeled a neoconservative. But he has always been a skeptic and pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and he is not afraid to change his mind. While he was an opponent of affirmative action in the 1970's and 80's, he later came to believe that some kind of policy was necessary to maintain minority representation in higher education, and in 2003 he joined in a friend-of-the-court brief defending the University of Michigan in a case that led to a Supreme Court endorsement of some affirmative action policies. As the documentary filmmaker Joseph Dorman has said of Glazer, ""He is a happy party of one.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/books/review/up-front.html
2005-09-26,Boys' Night Out," Twenty-Nine Pounds is all it takes for the hottest boys' night out in eastern europe. One if by land, two if by EasyJet. Lured less by perfectly preserved medieval spires than by cut-rate flights, cheap booze and rumors of relaxed sexual mores, British bachelors are flocking to Tallinn, Estonia, which is rapidly becoming the hottest ""stag night"" destination in Europe. Early pub closings have long driven the British to go elsewhere for their prenuptial benders. But in recent years, most of the favorite destinations have grown tired of these vomiting visitors. Many of the bars and hostelries in Dublin, Amsterdam and Barcelona have adopted ""no stag or hen night"" policies, driving bachelors to the Baltics. Vilnius and Riga, the capitals of Lithuania and Latvia, are waiting in the wings whenever Tallinn's had enough. EasyJet began offering London-Tallinn returns from Â£40 ($72) last October, and tour operators like Tallinnpissup.com offer to organize a ""medieval lesbian stripper show and meal"" for as little as Â£29 ($52) a person.

2005-09-26,Inside the List,"RUSHDIE'S LIST: The winner of this year's Man Booker Prize will be announced on Oct. 10 in London, and among the novels no longer in contention, surprisingly to some, are Salman Rushdie's ""Shalimar the Clown,"" Ian McEwan's ""Saturday"" and J. M. Coetzee's ""Slow Man."" The omission of Rushdie's novel from the contest's shortlist seems particularly startling -- if only because the Booker's chief judge this year, the critic John Sutherland, reviewed ""Shalimar the Clown"" in The Evening Standard not long ago and said that it displays Rushdie ""writing at his best."" There's not much consolation for Rushdie on this week's best-seller list, where ""Shalimar the Clown"" does not appear. (You can find it instead on the hardcover fiction extended list, available online, where it makes its debut at No. 18.) None of Rushdie's first three novels, ""Grimus"" (1975), ""Midnight's Children"" (1981) and ""Shame"" (1983), made the Times list. His commercial breakthrough was ""The Satanic Verses,"" which spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the hardcover fiction list in 1989, knocking off a Danielle Steel confection called ""Star,"" after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran declared that Rushdie had been ""sentenced to death.""

Also on tap is ""Greeneland: Graham Greene and the Cinema,"" an illustrated lecture about the British novelist's long and fascinating affair with the seventh art. (""What I object to,"" wrote Greene, ""is the idea that it is the critic's business to assist films to fulfill a social function. The critic's business should be confined to the art."") In addition, look for a reprise of Steven Soderbergh's latest, ""Bubble,"" and two screenings of ""Capote,"" Bennett Miller's already justly lauded film starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote. A full review of that film will appear in The Times tomorrow. Essential viewing can be found in the festival's sidebar program ""The Beauty of the Everyday: Japan's Shochiku Company at 110,"" dedicated to the great Japanese film studio. Among the treasures on view are early films from the auteurs Heinosuke Gosho, Yasujiro Shimazu, Hiroshi Shimizu Yasujiro Ozu, Mikio Naruse and Kenji Mizoguchi.

2005-09-27,Right-Wing Victors Face Tough Talks in Poland,"Two center-right parties prepared for talks to form a new government together after a victory in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Fighting the country's endemic corruption, which helped cause the rout of former Communists in the voting, is an issue that the two parties -- Law and Justice, which, with 90 percent of the vote counted, had 27 percent, and Civic Platform, which had 24 percent -- should be able to unite behind, but their alliance is expected to be more sorely tested on economic policy. Law and Justice won over left-leaning voters with bitter attacks on Civic Platform's plan for a flat tax. Yesterday, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the Law and Justice leader poised to become the next prime minister, promised lower taxes but ruled out the flat tax. His party's victory in the parliamentary vote was a potential gain for his twin brother, Lech, the party's candidate in the presidential election on Oct. 9.

Yesterday, the Association of Flight Attendants denounced the film's depiction of airplane crew members as ""rude, unhelpful and uncaring,"" according to a statement issued by the union, which represents 80,000 flight attendants at a number of airlines. It was joined in the protest by the Professional Flight Attendants Association, the union for flight attendants at Northwest, and the Transport Workers Union, which represents them at Southwest. ""We will tell Hollywood that this disrespect to our profession is not going to fly,"" said Patricia Friend, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants. But like many flights lately, the effort is a little late. ""Flightplan"" has already had a successful takeoff, landing at No. 1 in last weekend's box-office grosses. And trailers for ""Flightplan"" were widely shown in movie theaters all summer, ostensibly giving the flight attendants plenty of time to schedule their campaign before the movie arrived in theaters. Nonetheless, Ms. Friend deemed the film an ""outrage"" that does not properly credit the flight attendants' role as first responders. Tell that to Ms. Foster's character, who spends the movie battling her crew's reluctance to believe her child is missing.

2005-09-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   EASTMAN, LAURA DELANO ADAMS","EASTMAN -- Laura Delano Adams. 79, on September 23, 2005. Born on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, she was the daughter of Frederick Baldwin Adams and Ellen Walters Delano and grew up in the family home at 8 East 69th Street in Manhattan. She married Jack Eastman, Director of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, from whom she was amicably divorced and who predeceased her. Her late brother, Frederick B. Adams, Jr., was the former Director of the Morgan Library and a consummate bibliophile. She is survived by her dear companion Mary (""Bunny"") Diehl, her nieces, Gillian Adams, Anne Adams Chambers, Judith Adams and Lauren Fortmiller, and, of course, her horse ""Walker"". Laura graduated from the Chapin School and Barnard College, and initially followed in her brother's footsteps becoming a knowledgeable and accomplished curator of private libraries and collections. She was a superb horsewoman specializing in showing fivegaited saddle horses, and was a supporter of many US Olympic Equestrian teams. While visiting her mother's cousins, Franklin and Eleanor, in the White House on December 7, 1941, she spent the afternoon teaching the President's dog, Fala, to roll over. She went on to raise and train dogs to assist deaf persons, helping to found the agency which coordinates such efforts, Assistance Dogs International. Her life-long devotion to the Metropolitan Opera led naturally to her involvement in the theater, and for many years she organized and directed the summer theater program at the Community House in Fire Island Pines, and was a supporter of the John Drew Playhouse in East Hampton. She took delight in telling how her friend Jerry Herman wrote ""Hello Dolly"" on the back deck of her bay cottage in the Pines, where she also served for many years on the board of FIPPOA. With her husband Jack and friend Henry Grady, she developed ""Sandy Ground"" in Jost Van Dyke, B.V.I., where she could pursue her interest in snorkeling. After surviving a serious encounter with cancer of the oropharynx, Laura dedicated herself as a patient-to-patient peer counselor for in-coming cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, volunteering as many as five or six days a week for nearly twenty years. On Sundays, she could be found ushering at St. James's Church, Manhattan, or in attendance at St. Luke's in East Hampton or St. Ann's in Bridgehampton. She attended the Institute of Theology at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, was a Governor of The Laymen's Club of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, and was the former librarian of The Church Club of New York. She was a supporter of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, founded by her granduncle, Henry Walters. Her greatest charitable effort was with St. John Eye Hospital in East Jerusalem, for which, under a commission from Queen Elizabeth II, she was made a Dame of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem last September at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Everyone who loved Laura is invited to a memorial service on October 20 at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street. Instead of flowers, gifts in Laura's memory may be made to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center. A committal service at a date to be announced will follow at St. Luke's in East Hampton. In the Spring, a portion of Laura's ashes will be scattered at the Adams cabins on Campobello Island and into the Bay of Fundy.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/classified/paid-notice-deaths-eastman-laura-delano-adams.html

Demand for the fuel will rise to 16.9 billion liters in the year that starts next month, from 16.1 billion liters this year, the International Sugar Organization said last week. ""Because oil is very expensive, a higher proportion of sugar cane is diverted to ethanol production,"" said Marius Sonnen, president of Sonnen & Company, a sugar trading and shipping company based in New York. ""That reduces the amount of sugar that's available for export.""

ABC's broadcast of a lopsided ""Monday Night Football"" game, in which the Denver Broncos routed the Kansas City Chiefs, won in Nielsen's estimates for the 18-to-49 demographic. But CBS was No. 1 in total viewers. Its two-hour comedy block made its debut last week, and three out of four shows held up well: ""King of Queens"" (10.57 million), ""How I Met Your Mother"" (10.16 million) and ""Two and a Half Men"" (14.45 million). But ""Out of Practice,"" the new sitcom with Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing, drew 11.74 million viewers, which was a significant drop-off from ""Men,"" its lead-in. The weakness of ""Practice"" isn't doing ""CSI: Miami"" any favors. Though the procedural was the most-watched program of the night, with an audience of 16.74 million, it drew its second lowest 18-to-49 rating ever for an original episode. Elsewhere, NBC's ""Surface"" sank from its premiere last Monday, with 8.82 million viewers, two million fewer than its debut had delivered. And week two of the WB's new series ""Just Legal"" continued to get killed (3.02 million) in the 9 p.m. hour.

Last week the boards of the groups -- the Provincetown Theater Company, a 42-year-old community troupe, and the Provincetown Repertory Theater, a 10-year-old Equity company -- acquiesced to an outspoken majority and voted to amend their plan. Next year they will begin producing plays as the New Provincetown Players. ""We then also passed a second motion that the word 'new' is integral to our name,"" said Howard Burchman, president of the Provincetown Theater Company. ""So in case those people are confused and think we're Eugene O'Neill and Susan Glaspell, we've let them know that we are not."" Historians and artists had voiced their outrage in newspapers and on the Eugene O'Neill Society Web site over what they viewed as the usurpation of a name distinctive in American theater. Founded in 1916 by Glaspell and her husband, George Cook Cram, the short-lived Provincetown Players played a seminal role in noncommercial American theater and produced O'Neill's first works.

The man, Malcolm Mitchell was arrested at 12:30 a.m., the police said, and charges against him were pending. It was not known if the laptop which could access a database of 11,000 participants in the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program and was stolen on July 10, was recovered. The hospital said participants were not informed of the theft until last week, when program officials sent them a letter suggesting that they obtain credit reports to ensure that their identities had not been stolen, as the database included their Social Security numbers, ZIP codes and dates of birth. A spokeswoman for Mount Sinai, Leslie Schwartz, said she did not know why the delay occurred. A password is needed to gain access to the database, she said, and officials believe that the laptop was stolen for its resale value, not for the information stored inside.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-manhattan-laptop-with-911-data-is-stolen.html

2005-09-30,The Listings: Sept. 30 -- Oct. 6; SCOTT DUBOIS AND LOREN STILLMAN,"For much of jazz's history, and particularly since the dawn of the Marsalis era, up-and-comers have been elevated according to their command of the jazz tradition. But ""the jazz tradition"" is a fluid concept these days, encompassing not only blues and bebop but also the jangly polyphony of Ornette Coleman, the enigmatic lyricism of Wayne Shorter and the folk idioms of far-flung locales. Loren Stillman, a saxophonist, and Scott DuBois, a guitarist, are two examples of younger artists with this broad-minded definition of the music, and each has begun to make waves. Last week, Mr. DuBois, above left, took part in the semifinals for the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition; Mr. Stillman, above right, was a semifinalist in 2002. They have several more things in common: exploratory yet melodic sensibilities, serious compositional ambitions and the tutelage of the saxophonist David Liebman. Naturally, the two musicians work together, in Mr. DuBois's longtime quintet; the other members are the saxophonist Jason Rigby, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Mark Ferber. ""Monsoon,"" an album released last year on the Soul Note label, weighs this ensemble's cohesive looseness against the complex subtleties of Mr. DuBois's compositions. Similar tensions inhabit the music of Mr. Stillman, whose fourth solo album, ""It Could Be Anything"" (Fresh Sound New Talent), will be available in late October. Two nights after playing with Mr. DuBois, Mr. Stillman will lead a quartet featuring the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Ted Poor, each a bandleader in his own right. (The Scott DuBois Group plays Sunday at 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883; $5.

2005-09-30,The Listings: Sept. 30 -- Oct. 6; 'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEU',"The most famous creation of the composer Paul Dukas was most famously played by Mickey Mouse, who appeared as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in the original Disney film ""Fantasia."" It is slightly odd that Dukas should be associated with a cartoon icon, since he was an eminently serious composer: one reason that he's not better known is that he was so self-critical that he destroyed much of his own work. One piece that did survive was his major opera, ""Ariane et Barbe-Bleu,"" which had its premiere at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1907. Its dense, luminous score has historically won the approval of musicians, and its female lead has been played by some of the 20th century's great sopranos (including Germaine Lubin and Geraldine Farrar). But it has never caught on with the public even as much as, say, Debussy's ""Pelléas et Mélisande,"" another setting of a Maeterlinck play, and certainly not as much as Bartok's ""Bluebeard's Castle,"" another operatic version of the same folk tale. Now New York City Opera is giving at least some of the public a rare chance to hear the work (for those who weren't around for its Met performances in 1911 and 1912), in a new production. Many of those involved are new to the company, among them Paul-Émile Fourny, the director; Louis Désiré, the set and costume designer (see the design above); the soprano Renate Behle, replacing Carol Vaness, who had to withdraw for health reasons, as Ariane; and Leon Botstein, the conductor, president of Bard College, and a passionate defender of less-known music. His conducting skills, unfortunately, don't match his passion, but this is still a work well worth hearing. (Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5570; remaining tickets, $25 to $95.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/arts/movies/the-listings-sept-30-oct-6-ariane-et-barbebleu.html

2005-09-30,The 'Outsider' Art of 'Junebug',"In Phil Morrison's film ""Junebug,"" a Chicago art dealer (Embeth Davidtz) travels South to research the work of a self-taught artist named David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor, above.) The paintings attributed to the fictional Wark -- strange, visionary tableaus of racial and sexual violence during the Civil War, painted with acrylic, ink and house paint on found surfaces, including plywood, linoleum and book covers -- were actually made for the film by a Brooklyn-based artist, Ann Wood. What is it like for a trained painter to be commissioned to produce work that deliberately invokes that of an untrained, or ""outsider,"" artist? In an interview, Ms. Wood recalled her working process for the film: ""Phil and I spent a lot of time together looking at things -- naïve art and Civil War photography and the murals at Pompeii -- and experimenting during the week or so before he went to North Carolina to begin filming. The first few attempts weren't successful, but in each step of the process, we solved a problem or found a piece of the puzzle. Phil's got a giant imagination."" She acknowledged the influence of well-known outsider artists like Howard Finster, Horace Pippin and Henry Darger on the ""Junebug"" paintings.

The audience of choreographers, performers, presenters and others within the New York dance world knows what a vital and intelligent role that organization plays in fostering the creation of process-oriented, investigative movement like that of K.J.Holmes, above. If you want to see how choreographers think about, develop and explore emerging aesthetics in dance, head over to Dance Theater Workshop any Sunday over the next two months, where, for the 14th season, artists chosen by a rotating panel of their peers will show works-in-progress. On this first Sunday, Jonah Bokaer, Heather Kravas, Kiyoko Kashiwagi and Melanie Maar will present their ideas; Ms. Maar is currently an artist-in-residence at Movement Research, a title held last year by both Ms. Kravas and Mr. Kashiwagi. The focus here is on exploration, not end result, with the artists performing anything they choose within a 5-to-15 minute period. While the work can incorporate other art forms, don't expect a lot of high-tech bells and whistles; as the name indicates, it's all about the movement. There's no admission, but neither are there reservations for the limited-seating showings, so arrive early. Doors open at 7:45 for 8 p.m. performances. (Sundays in October and November, starting this weekend, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)598-0551.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/arts/movies/the-listings-sept-30-oct-6-movement-research.html

NBC's ""Apprentice: Martha Stewart"" (6.22 million) was among the vanquished, sinking further from its weak debut last Wednesday. But ABC's ""Invasion"" didn't benefit from the strength of ""Lost"" nearly as much as it should have. It delivered 12.97 million viewers and was weaker in the second half-hour than the first, which is never a good sign. NBC's ""Law & Order"" roundly beat ""Invasion"" in total viewers (14.73 million), but more important, it did better than the season premiere of CBS's ""CSI: New York"" in both viewers (13.12 million) and adults 18 to 49. Before that, CBS's ""Criminal Minds"" made its time period debut opposite ""Lost"" and managed to place a very distant second, with an audience of 10.56 million. Fans of UPN's critically beloved ""Veronica Mars"" can feel some relief.

2005-09-30,Unconventional Perspectives on American History and the Irish Troubles,"Both Neil Jordan's ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" the centerpiece of the New York Film Festival, and Lars von Trier's ""Manderlay"" stretch the traditional boundaries of what we think of as epic films. The hero/heroine of Mr. Jordan's sprawling comedy is a male transvestite; the heroine of ""Manderlay,"" the second part of Mr. von Trier's United States trilogy, is a gangster's idealistic daughter whose grand do-gooder schemes inevitably backfire. The movies are political in opposite ways. Mr. Jordan's radically apolitical protagonist, Kitten, mirrors the absurdity of war (the Irish troubles). ""Manderlay"" is an allegorical tract about racism in America that asks uncomfortable questions about slavery and its legacy that no major American filmmaker would dare address so boldly. Both are important films. STEPHEN HOLDEN",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/movies/unconventional-perspectives-on-american-history-and-the-irish.html
