2021-12-02,Shifting Styles and Blue Moods in the Pages of a Graphic Novel,"Matt Madden is the stuntman-philosopher of American comics. His best-known book, “99 Ways to Tell a Story,” riffed on Raymond Queneau’s “Exercises in Style.” That bible of experimental writing from 1947 retold a mundane scenario — a mild contretemps on a Paris bus — with precision (“In a bus of the S line, 10 meters long, 3 wide, 6 high …”), in Cockney (“A sees vis young Froggy bloke, caw bloimey …”) and so on. Transposing the conceit to the graphic medium, Madden devised his own non-anecdote: Man leaves desk, opens fridge, tells someone the time, then can’t recall why he stood up in the first place. This ball of nothing gets reworked as (among other things) a batch of daily comic strips, a piece of the Bayeux Tapestry and a do-it-yourself kit in which each element (from wristwatch to lettering) is separated as if in a box, ready for assembly. The hilarity mounts, but so does the mystery of what makes a story. In flaunting style over substance, he shows them to be one and the same.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/books/review/matt-madden-ex-libris-r-kikuo-johnson-no-one-else.html

For example, I’m pretty sure this is the first time I’ve ever started solving by filling in every entry beginning with the letters A-T-W-O-O-D (as in Margaret Atwood, the author of today’s passage) before finding any others. This advanced my progress quite a bit and was ironic to me, because I’m a fan of this excellent Canadian writer and have read several of her novels. I couldn’t place the passage, though, and as it took shape I assumed that I’d read and forgotten it, because of course I would blank on such a lyrical description of memory. It turns out that the excerpt is from “The Testaments,” Atwood’s 2019 sequel to “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which I haven’t yet read).",Crosswords & Games,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/crosswords/variety-acrostic.html

While the department reported clearance rates of nearly 90 percent in 2018 and 2019 to the federal government, those figures include cases that were closed in those years but stemmed from homicides that occurred in earlier years. Statistics sent to the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice by the Police Department show that the department considers between 70 and 75 percent of the homicides that occurred in 2018 and 2019 to be closed.

We know we all remember things a little differently, with reality fracturing into competing narratives the further we get from any given occurrence. But when disaster is near-universal and the gulf of disagreement vast, it’s easy to question our own recollections as suspect. Here, then, are books full of dueling paradigms, uncertain and chancy remembrance — with the past looming both as a resource and as a nightmare, and the future at its mercy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/books/review/new-science-fiction-fantasy.html

Two enormous volumes of plates, the size of 19th-century ledgers, and an accompanying almanac, “Annals of the North” — the dimensions of a hard-bound dictionary — constitute this account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, beginning in 1972 and extending past the end of the 20th century. Peress, from Paris, went to Derry as a young Magnum photographer, knowing little English; right away he witnessed the British Army’s massacre of 14 civilians in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Within a year, he had embedded himself so thoroughly that his photographs were often called upon as evidence in court. He developed ties with many people, sometimes tragically; one of his closest Republican friends turned out to be an informer and was killed by the I.R.A. It is clear from this work — the title comes from the I.R.A.’s “Green Book” — that Peress left a chunk of his soul in Ulster.

In the 80 years since she gave her final performance, “I want to be alone” (a line she spoke in “Grand Hotel”)  has become the thing for which she is best remembered — more than her talent, probably more than her beauty and certainly more than her movies, of which even a lot of cinephiles would have trouble naming five. Her professional legacy is lean: Even the two famous slogans associated with her — “Garbo Talks!” for her first sound picture, “Anna Christie,” and “Garbo Laughs” for her most enduring (let’s just say best), Ernst Lubitsch’s “Ninotchka”  — herald deviations from the norm.

These vessels are the only residents of this more than 200-year-old traditionally built house, or kominka. A lopsided white one, with gently indented fingerprints mottling its surface like fish scales, rests on the decaying tatami in the large front room. A turnip-shaped pair, one painted with dripping indigo polka dots and the other with a thick belt of sooty brown, seem to gaze out a window together. Hand-formed from grayish-white clay from Japan’s Shiga Prefecture, they are the work of the artist Kazunori Hamana, 51, who uses this once-grand dwelling as an exhibition space. His pieces have been shown at prestigious galleries, including Blum & Poe in Los Angeles and New York, but he refers to them simply as tsubo, a word that suggests utilitarian crocks holding homemade pickles in a grandmother’s kitchen. Compared to these familiar objects, though, Hamana’s tsubo are at once imposing — most measure nearly 30 inches across — and delicate, their weathered and cracked surfaces echoing the crumbling wattle-and-daub walls of their home.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/t-magazine/kazunori-hamana-studio.html

2021-12-06,The Week in Business: Uncertainty Over the New Virus Variant,"Policymakers, businesses and investors grappled last week with uncertainty over how the Omicron variant of the coronavirus will affect the still-fragile global economy. More than 30 countries, including the United States, have now detected the variant. But it is still unclear how contagious, dangerous and resistant to vaccines it may be. President Biden on Thursday extended a requirement for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses until mid-March and introduced a new requirement that international travelers be tested for the coronavirus one day before departing for the United States. After oil prices collapsed when reports of Omicron first emerged, OPEC Plus, a group of oil-producing countries that includes Russia, decided to stay on course with its plans to increase production — but said its meeting would “remain in session” in case adjustments were required. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the variant could prolong the supply chain problems that have caused persistently high inflation. And one investment manager said of Omicron’s impact on the economy: “I think it’s just guesswork, for anybody. Because we just don’t know.”",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/week-ahead-uncertainty-virus-economy.html

For 10 years, we lived in an apartment in the middle of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with two other people and one other cat.

She is as low-maintenance as an expensive ottoman, but her passion for ornithology knows no bounds.

A morning stroll near his building, in Ridgewood, Queens, did not offer up anything with the kind of Wilsonian surreality the show specializes in — but our destination, a dollar store Wilson described as one of his favorites, did. He told me that he spends a lot of time in dollar stores when he has writer’s block. Nearby he pointed out a display of tools from Trisonic, a budget brand he investigated in a 2016 short film, before collecting the things he’d come for: sink strainers, a miniature folding chair, a toilet seat with a fluffy white Pomeranian printed on its lid. On the way to the checkout, he marveled at a product he said he’d already purchased from a different dollar store: a clock radio with a built-in fish tank far too tiny for a fish, a “cool dollar-store-only object.” The entire place suddenly felt like a tidy analogue of Wilson’s show: filled with things too mundane, too accidentally strange, too tacky or sad or flawed or lacking in panache, to actively star in anyone else’s account of the world.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/magazine/how-to-john-wilson.html

My father, the crooner, is always the life of the party, the class clown. My mother calls him a yes man, which she thinks means someone who says “yes” anytime he’s asked to hang out, which my father does. He loves fun, and as someone who also loves fun, I wanted him to have a record player for whenever his friends come over to play cards.

He meant a vaccine suitable for all ages that would be at least 75 percent effective for a year or more against Influenza A viruses — the type that causes pandemics but that also, along with Influenza B, annually infects as many as a billion people worldwide and kills somewhere between 290,000 to 650,000 of them. A push to develop such a vaccine began in earnest about a decade earlier and was gaining momentum. “That’s something that I’m spending a lot of time on,” he said. “Also, a lot of scientists are struggling in a positive way to make advances.” It was, he went on, “somewhat embarrassing” that a new and updated flu vaccine had to be made every year. “We really need to do much, much better to get a better vaccine.

2021-12-09,Will Smith Is Done Trying to Be Perfect,"Will Smith’s superpower as a performer — as a movie star — has always been his radiating charisma. Who else could have credibly portrayed Muhammad Ali, the most charismatic man ever? In “King Richard,” Smith transmutes that gift into something subtler but just as powerful in his portrayal of Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena. (Smith, as he was eager to acknowledge, was supported in the film by Saniyya Sidney as Venus, Demi Singleton as Serena and Aunjanue Ellis as the girls’ mother and Williams’s wife at the time, Oracene Price.) Richard Williams, as embodied by Smith, is a man who has been physically bowed but not beaten. He has a limp from a racist attack as a child; his carriage is tense, a little unsure, as if always on alert for a sucker punch. He’s someone who has spent time beneath the underdog. And yet when it comes to Williams’s daughters and his dreams for them of tennis greatness, Smith invests his character with his trademark on-screen self-assurance. That Smith, who is 53 and who this autumn published a searching memoir, “Will,” was able to express those disparate traits so effectively is something he attributes to the work, precipitated by that book, that he has lately put into himself. “I wouldn’t have been able to play Richard Williams in this way,” Smith says, “before I had examined my life and understood so many aspects of my childhood and how that affected the decisions I made as a parent.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/magazine/will-smith-interview.html

After being convicted of that crime, Ruth (Sandra Bullock), did 20 years in prison. Now paroled, she telegraphs her angst with sunken eyes and chapped lips; the film’s sickly yellow lighting does the same, as does Ruth’s night-shift factory gig decapitating salmon. But the dead officer’s sons (Will Pullen and Tom Guiry) don’t think that Ruth has repented enough — a judgment shared by the adoptive parents (Richard Thomas and Linda Emond) who raised Ruth’s orphaned baby sister, Katherine, to forget her older sibling. The adult Katherine (Aisling Franciosi) is haunted by memories of a mysterious brunette. (Katherine crashes her car the moment Ruth is released from prison, giving the film a mystical spritz that evaporates immediately.)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/movies/the-unforgivable-review.html

Since then, Dani Garcia, his restaurant in Marbella, Spain, picked up a third Michelin star (it’s now closed), and the chef formed his own company, Grupo Dani Garcia. Now, he has returned to New York and is on the marquee of Casa Dani in the Manhattan West complex, west of the Moynihan Train Hall. “What I’m doing at Casa Dani is not fine dining,” he said. “I want to showcase the culture of Spain, making it easy, fresh and fun, more like home cooking.” He said a great deal had changed since he was first in New York, especially the increasing availability of ingredients. His thinking has also changed, he said. “Twenty-five years of fine dining, which is more conceptual and less from the heart, is enough,” he said. What hasn’t changed is having Alberto Carballo, the chef de cuisine, at his side. A soaring 180-seat dining room, a sea of beige designed by David Rockwell, sits on a level below the bar and open kitchen. There are tapas; fried items like cod fritters; bigger portions (raciones), many with seafood; and rice and noodle specialties. There are also a few main dishes, including daurade and hanger steak, and even larger-format platters for the table like whole Spanish turbot. A section on the menu is devoted to fresh tuna prepared several ways, which Mr. Garcia considers to be representative of the soul of Spanish cooking. Near the entrance to Mr. Garcia’s restaurant, which he runs with Sam Nazarian, is his Pollo Verde, a casual spot in the Citizens NY food hall at the complex.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-openings.html

If breasts are presented in profile, stomach proportions have to be considered. Taken from the front, with elbows pressed inward to slim the waist, breasts may acquire “the pendulous aspect of a nursing ape’s.” Lasley taps her phone’s camera button relentlessly, documenting each shift in pose, until, on her 94th try, she strikes the nude-selfie jackpot: an image that improves upon reality without veering into implausibility.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/books/review-sea-state-tabitha-lasley.html

Willcock was introduced to Conran’s mother, the interior designer Sophie Conran, in the early 1990s by his employer at the time, the design and restaurant impresario (and Sophie’s father) Terence Conran, who died last year. So it was perhaps inevitable that the couple’s two children would become passionate about design as well (their daughter, Coco Conran, has a fashion line). And since Conran and Willcock established their business in 2018, Willcock’s home, Kemps House — a 17th-century brick manor in West Sussex into which he moved with his second wife, Charlie Kinsman, 17 years ago — has served double duty as the company’s headquarters and showroom. Almost every room features at least one of the brand’s voluptuous yet modern sofas, armchairs, beds or love seats, all made entirely from natural materials and upholstered in linens, velvets and brushed cottons in a palette of rich, earthy shades from moss green to burnt sienna.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/t-magazine/christmas-dinner-entertaining-holidays.html

2021-12-21,Jody Williams and Rita Sodi Open Commerce Inn in the West Village,"In their latest venture, Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who own four highly regarded restaurants in the West Village, have been seduced by history. And it’s not just the history of this location, which was built in 1911, and formerly housed Fifty, Commerce, Grange Hall, Blue Mill Tavern and a speakeasy before that. “We’re taking it back to a colonial tavern,” Ms. Williams said, even including a Tavern Room, fitted with a dark wood back bar, a zinc counter, custom stools and compact booths. They also did their homework, looking to an old store in Virginia that was once a train station for floor and ceiling boards, a Vermont maker of Shaker-style furniture for the chairs and benches in the large dining room and even the fonts Ms. Sodi used for the menu. “It’s all about simplicity and craftsmanship,” Ms. Williams said. Food in the tavern, open now with the dining room coming soon, starts with oysters served raw, pickled or fried. Then the choices are smoked cod cakes, country ham, marrow with mushrooms, greens with buttermilk dressing, spoon bread and baked apple. Wines are domestic, mostly East Coast. The dinner menu, in the sparsely decorated white-tablecloth dining room, will feature roasts like duck and pork. For breakfast, also on the horizon, there will be scrapple, porridge, eggs and smoked fish. In keeping with the historic approach, bartenders haul ice for drinks like milk punches and switchels in 25-pound blocks with vintage tongs, and electronics are hidden in drawers. There is no espresso machine. But at the same time, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi insist it’s not a theme park frozen in the past: They use olive oil, not typical of the era being evoked. “It fits with some of our dishes, but we’re also thrilled to be using ingredients that aren’t French or Italian, to be exploring a new genre,” Ms. Williams said. “We’re having a lot of fun.”",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/dining/nyc-restaurant-openings.html

2021-12-27,A Year of Shabbats in One Cookbook,"The start of a new year is as good a time as any to consult “52 Shabbats,” a cookbook that features a year of Friday night dinners. The Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashana) would be the most appropriate kickoff — that’s where the book begins its seasonal chapters — but it was not published until this month, so here we are. The author explains Shabbat, kosher food and the Jewish communities around the world that inspired the recipes, many featuring the elaborate spices or spice blends that are typical of places like Ethiopia, India and Mexico. Most of the featured recipes are for main dishes (notably for chicken and pot roasts), but there are also sides, desserts, basics and menu suggestions. A chicken and vegetable tagine, fish cakes inspired by India and fritters made from leftover challah are worth keeping.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/dining/52-shabbats-cookbook.html
2021-12-27,Preorder a French Galette des Rois,"In many countries the observance of Christmas stretches into January, culminating on Epiphany, Jan. 6, when Jesus Christ was said to have been revealed to the world through the agency of the Magi, the three kings. In France, the day has been commemorated for centuries with a delicious puff pastry cake filled with frangipane in which a fève, or bean, but sometimes a tiny porcelain figure, is buried, with the finder being crowned king or queen. French pastry shops throughout New York bake them, often in a large or individual size, and have them available through most of January. Ordering in advance is advised, and often required. This year, Cuis’in, a French caterer in Manhattan is updating theirs with fillings of matcha and chocolate, in addition to the traditional almond paste. They come with the fève on the side for the buyer to insert, and with a gilded paper crown for the king or queen. They can be ordered now for delivery to Manhattan starting Jan. 3; and to Brooklyn and Queens starting Jan. 6 and continuing until Jan. 30; nationwide shipping is also available. Mirjam Lavabre, the owner, said the galettes are so popular she plans to offer them year-round with other fillings like ginger and pomegranate.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/dining/galette-des-rois.html

In “41-Love,” she writes, often with dark humor, about her experiences with the game.

Below, Thomas talks about wanting to write a “Rocky” story, playing a seniors event at Wimbledon and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/29/books/scarlett-thomas-41-love-tennis-memoir-interview.html
