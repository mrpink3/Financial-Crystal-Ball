Ms. Hartman made her name documenting the Studio 54 scene in the 1970s. (Her most famous image may be of Bianca Jagger at the nightclub, astride a horse.) Today she remains a tireless fixture of Manhattan night life, flitting about in her tinted glasses, cropped blond hairdo and high-end designer plumage, attending openings, parties and fashion events, in pursuit of revealing glimpses of the glitterati. And Ms. Hartman indisputably has a gift for capturing the spontaneous moment.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/movies/the-incomparable-rose-hartman-review.html

By “modern days” he appears to mean since the 1970s and ’80s, a period he calls “the heyday of North American category horror” (while citing, among other touchstones, a couple of novels written in the ’50s and ’60s).

It treated the beach like a prison yard, a place to be patrolled and policed, not for fun and frolicking.

2017-06-02,On Ireland’s Border: ‘That Sad Old Game’,"BELFAST, Northern Ireland — When Britain voted last June to leave the European Union, Northern Ireland voted to remain by a clear majority. Along the border with the Republic of Ireland, that majority was even larger, about 64 percent. The referendum was a hard knock for the Borderlanders — a blunt reminder that they are peripheral not only to the geography of Britain but also to the debate about its future. The damage that leaving the European Union could do to their lives and livelihoods was hardly considered in wider Britain.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/opinion/sunday/northern-ireland-border-brexit.html
2017-06-02,The Romance and Heartbreak of Writing in a Language Not Your Own,"As a child, Leonora Carrington — painter, fabulist, incorrigible eccentric — developed the disconcerting ability to write backward with her left hand while writing forward with her right. This trick did not go over well with English convent school nuns. Between the world wars, Carrington was thrown out of one school after another for persistently odd behavior. When she came of age, she fled England — and her family’s fortune — for France and the Surrealists, for a life crammed with incident and adventure, occasional poverty and steady productivity. She died in Mexico City in 2011, at the age of 94, leaving behind paintings and stories full of strange, spectral charm, in which women undress down to their skeletons and a sociable hyena might venture out to a debutante ball, wearing the face of a murdered maid.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/review/the-romance-and-heartbreak-of-writing-in-a-language-not-your-own.html

2017-06-02,"Satires of the Ultrarich, From One of Their Own","THE HAVES: Kevin Kwan’s novel “Rich People Problems” — new at No. 12 on the hardcover fiction list — concludes a bubbly trilogy about the backbiting and infighting in a ridiculously wealthy Chinese clan. (A movie adaptation of the first book in the series, “Crazy Rich Asians,” is in preproduction with Warner Brothers.) The aura of gaudy glamour and bling in these books may seem like the stuff of soap operas, but it’s essentially true to the world in which Kwan was raised — so much so, he has said, that his relatives have no interest in reading his work. “Most of my family is completely puzzled by these books, and they don’t really understand what the fuss is all about,” he told the website Nylon last month. “They don’t really get the humor, and it’s just like, ‘Everyone has a hundred million dollars, what’s the big deal?’ or ‘Why is any of this interesting?’” That’s O.K. with Kwan. He’s not writing for his family anyway. “I think people who are going to pick up a book called ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ or ‘Rich People Problems’ are looking for the fun and the froth; they’re looking for an escape. They’re looking for it to be like a fun romp into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,” he said. “They’re not looking for Cormac McCarthy.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/review/satires-of-the-ultrarich-from-one-of-their-own.html

2017-06-06,"New Sentences: From ‘The World to Come,’ by Jim Shepard","This sentence occurs in the middle of a short story but is basically its own little devastating poem: the ecology of an estranged marriage. The narrator is a 19th-century farmer’s wife who has fallen in love with another farmer’s wife — a love that is brutally denied by the men involved.

So it’s a bit of a shock that “Dawson City: Frozen Time” begins with a brightly colored, completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears, talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/movies/dawson-city-frozen-time-review.html

Tolkien, who died in 1973, lands at No. 6 with “Beren and Lúthien,” about the Middle-earth romance between a human and an elf. Tempting as it is to picture the sentient heads of Crichton and Tolkien preserved in jars somewhere, “Futurama” style, spinning new stories, the reality is more mundane: Both books were exhumed from the authors’ files in varying states of readiness and prepared for publication by their estates. In Tolkien’s case that means readers will find copious notes from his third son, Christopher Tolkien, who traces the story’s evolution through a series of epic poems that are — like much of the Middle-earth canon — wildly inventive and technically flawless and also sort of insufferable at times.

(See our highlights from the shows.) The leader of the pack is the 26-year-old Charles Jeffrey, the designer and mastermind behind the beautifully eclectic and wildly weird world of the label Loverboy, who is ushering in a new generation of British fashion. His first stand-alone runway show this weekend — which included a colorful cast of characters from punks and “cross-dressing infants” to duchesses and “miniskirted mudlarks” walking down the catwalk amid dancers in pink cardboard costumes — was a collaborative effort between Jeffrey and his friends from his earlier days of throwing raucous parties at the glitter-spattered dive club Vogue Fabrics in London’s East End. “We figured we’d get everyone together in one room, and see what we come up with,” Jeffrey said. “It was classic Loverboy — to bring everything into this one melting pot and then sort of react to it without thinking too much. It’s fun and funny and that’s how I like working with my friends.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/t-magazine/fashion/charles-jeffrey-behind-the-scenes-london-mens-fashion-week.html

In the late ’80s, you saw brands start to sell the idea, the sense of belonging, first. That primacy of the brand does a lot to explain Trump, and how he has developed this intimate relationship with his base, why they expect so little of him and why he gets away with what he gets away with, because the rules of branding are really simple: Be true to your brand.

This surprised me when I first moved to the country more than a decade ago. I expected God and money to be kept separate, at least outwardly, more in keeping with the discreet, cash-in-envelopes Christian churches of my youth. Yet around the exterior of the tiny, seafoam green 19th-century mosque across the street from my Istanbul home, I discovered an array of shops: a locksmith, a market, a kebab joint, a teahouse and a rotisserie vendor whose delicious, buttery chickens twirled all day outside. One of the imams who preached at the mosque was a part-time real estate agent. The attempted military coup last July lasted until the wee hours of the night, yet my little green mosque was, as usual, open and ready early the next morning for prayer; the locksmith whose shop was part of the complex waddled in by 9 a.m., and the happy blend of prayer and small-time hustle in Istanbul continued unabated.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/magazine/reading-erdogans-ambitions-in-turkeys-new-mosques.html

Researchers call these story-time interruptions “nonimmediate talk,” and studies have found it benefits children’s language development.

2017-06-16,Fast Success for a Second Novel Two Decades in the Making,"WHAT’S GOING ON: It’s been almost exactly 20 years since the release of Arundhati Roy’s first novel, “The God of Small Things,” about a scandal-plagued Indian family, which went on to win the 1997 Booker Prize and spent nearly a year as a New York Times best seller. Roy hasn’t been reclusive since then — she’s protested against the Indian state and written a number of political treatises — but as the years stretched into decades with no second novel in sight, readers could be forgiven for wondering if she was going to be, like Margaret Mitchell or Ralph Ellison, a one-hit wonder. So the arrival at long last of a follow-up, “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” (new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 7), is being heralded as a bit of a second coming: It appeared on the Book Review’s cover this month, and Roy has been the subject of admiring profiles in India and England and the United States. Not that she embraces the attention. “I was never a person who thought, Now that I’m famous, I’ll go live in London or New York and live the dream,” she told The Guardian. “I’m a social cripple in a cocktail party. My idea of a nightmare is people standing very elegantly dressed in a room with a drink in their hand.

2017-06-20,"New Sentences: From ‘Infinite Tuesday,’ by Michael Nesmith","Here is a pithy summation of the special loneliness of genius. Great artists live in a world in which their own excellence does not exist. They are shut out, uniquely, from their defining achievements. In the same way that an apple can’t eat an apple and a sunset can’t admire a sunset and the Matterhorn can’t ski its own slopes, Michael Jackson could never watch himself dance, at least not the way everyone else on Earth did. Although Herman Melville wrote every word of “Moby-Dick,” he could never read it as a reader — could never unsee the origin of all those wild metaphors, never turn the page with true surprise. Artists may know when they’ve done something great, but they’ll never know what it’s like to experience it from the other end.

2017-06-23,10 Things to Do in NYC Now,"Soon an endearing furry creature, indigenous to Japan but rarely seen here, will briefly invade American shores: the totoro. Visible only to children, this catlike woodland spirit springs from the imagination of the great Japanese animator and auteur Hayao Miyazaki. In this 1988 Studio Ghibli film, totoros — from dustball size to as large as a bus — provide joy and solace to Satsuki and her younger sister, Mei, who have accompanied their father to a rural area far from home while their hospitalized mother recovers from a mysterious illness. Although the girls’ odyssey ends happily, the film never denies the omnipresent specter of mortality or the power of children’s fears. GKids and Fathom Events will present the movie, accompanied by international shorts, in select theaters on Sunday at 12:55 p.m. (in English) and on Monday at 7 p.m. (in Japanese with English subtitles) as the opening event in Studio Ghibli Fest 2017, a six-film monthly Miyazaki series.

2017-06-28,Board Books to Get Babies Talking,"The board book — sized to fit comfortably in the hands of a baby or toddler, and with chunky pages that can’t be ripped — has to be one of the greatest innovations of the print era. Reading to a baby every day is so much easier when you don’t have to worry that the child will ingest the book. But how do you choose the best ones? Consider both how a board book looks and how it sounds. Many board books originate as full-sized picture books, but not every picture book has art that downsizes well into the board book format. There’s also the question of how it reads out loud — which is especially important for babies or toddlers who are on that delightful, babbling verge of talking. Here are nine great-looking board books — some new, some old — that can help babies on the road to talking.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/books/review/board-books-to-get-babies-talking.html

That wasn’t really a question we had planned to aim at Sofia Coppola’s “The Beguiled.” But her film — which is a remake of Don Siegel’s psychological thriller from 1971 about a house full of Confederate girls and women drawn to a wounded Union soldier, played by Clint Eastwood — makes a small but crucial change: The character of the women’s slave named Hallie, played in the original film by Mae Mercer, is omitted. Coppola has said she didn’t want to get the history wrong. But what does she lose by erasing an aspect of it? Is this is a correction, an omission or an act of artistic cowardice?",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/podcasts/historys-crucial-role-in-the-films-all-eyez-on-me-and-the-beguiled.html

2017-06-30,Whose Fault Is It Anyway? Three Books on the Shifting Nature of Responsibility in American Politics,"At some point in the last half-century, American politicians started talking about responsibility in a new way. Where “responsibility” once referred to the duties of the nation to its citizens, or of the citizens to the nation, or of fellow citizens to one another, it now came to mean the obligations of the individual to himself. Responsibility was personal responsibility. You might date the beginning of this shift to 1968, when Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, announced in a speech at the Republican National Convention that it was time to stop blaming “society” for people’s failings and to start accepting that “each individual is accountable for his actions.” You might date the completion of this shift to 1993, when President Bill Clinton exhorted Americans in his first Inaugural Address to “demand responsibility from all” and “to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/books/review/3-books-shifting-nature-responsibility-american-politics.html

The rest of the book both expands and makes exact the roots of memory, madness and womanhood implied here. But you can see how beautifully the poem stands alone.

I think of him as this nation’s equivalent to the Czech composer Leos Janacek (1854-1928).
