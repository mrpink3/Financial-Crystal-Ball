Potholed roads and even the city’s superhighways are crowded with traffic, overloaded vendors, earsplitting noise, choking pollution, piercing colors and powerful smells. Extreme wealth is set against a backdrop of grinding poverty, hope battles despair, daily acts of kindness and generosity are offset by cruelty, greed and corruption, and creativity is inspired by necessity because of the city’s broken infrastructure and the looming threat of ruin. Between these extremes, and usually to the background drone of a generator, exist the rich and textured lives of some 20 million people.",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/the-growth-of-contemporary-african-photography-at-lagosphoto/

Bush or Barack Obama. Roosevelt charmed the White House press corps to within an inch of its life, leaked big stories to favored reporters and still made time for writers from obscure trade journals and others who were technically ineligible for press credentials. He nevertheless shunned the Negro press, shutting it out of the White House press corps until the last of his 12 years in office. By avoiding fire-breathing newspapers like The Chicago Defender, The Baltimore Afro-American and The Pittsburgh Courier, Roosevelt insulated himself from questions about what ­African-Americans saw as the burning issue of the 1940s: the government’s decision to embrace segregation in the military. Separating military men and women — and even the plasma in the wartime blood bank — by race, the government ratified racial apartheid in the South and introduced Jim Crow segregation into parts of the country where it had been unknown.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/the-defender-by-ethan-michaeli.html

The next hospital over — bigger but not much shinier — was at least a six-hour drive away in a four-wheel-drive all-terrain vehicle on a good day, without any rains melting the treacherous dirt roads. About two weeks after I arrived there, I was caring for a young woman who was seriously ill.

Yet the enemy, in the forms of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, remains and must be confronted, in part, the Obama administration believes, by the American military.

2016-01-05,To Catch a Rapist,"A dull, frigid winter morning. Overhead, the sky was locked in gray, only occasionally releasing an ashen, icy flake or two, more like iron shavings than snow. On the third floor of the New Haven police station, Detective Kris Cuddy had just finished interviewing the mother of a young rape victim. After escorting the woman downstairs, she was returning to her office in the Special Victims Unit. Her square-heeled boots made a quick, hard sound as she left the elevators, a tock-tock-tock that could be heard above the ringing phones and cubicle chatter. The detective had an Irish face — blue-eyed, pale-skinned, puckish, her coppery brown hair shorn close at the sides into a fauxhawk. She was one of only four investigators in the S.V.U., and she had 32 cases open at the moment. But during interviews with victims or their family members, she never displayed any sign of the pressure she was under. Her manner was steady and reassuring. So we’re here to discuss an incident that happened recently, she would begin, making only a vague allusion to the matter at hand before stepping back to allow people to tell the story in their own way. She would offer water, offer a tissue. Let them talk, circling back later to gather more details. At the end of interviews with victims, she almost always told them they were brave.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/to-catch-a-rapist.html

Back then, she says, the path to health was: “You get sick, you hope to get an appointment with your doctor, you get a prescription and it treats your symptoms. Now, wellness has become mainstream.” And the biggest change, according to Close, may be how we approach it: “It’s the periods in between doctor appointments that are important.

Rick Snyder of Michigan declared a state of emergency for the Flint area on Tuesday as concerns grew about the health effects of lead-tainted water there. His order, which followed emergency declarations by the city and county governments, came on the day federal officials announced an investigation of the contamination. Mr. Snyder’s administration has been criticized as slow to respond to residents’ concerns about their water. Last week, he apologized and announced staffing changes at the state agency that oversees environmental quality. Flint, which had long received water from Lake Huron provided by Detroit’s water utility, began drawing its water from the Flint River in 2014 in an effort to save money while a new pipeline was built. Residents soon complained about rashes and strange odors from the river water, but city and state officials mostly insisted that it was safe to drink. Last year, elevated levels of lead were found in children’s blood, and in October, Flint switched back to Detroit’s water system. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, said Tuesday that the emergency declaration would allow for more state resources to be used in addressing the effects of the tainted water.

We are both first-generation college graduates for whom solid public-school educations made all the difference. We are struggling with choosing a public school for our son, who will enter kindergarten this year. State test scores came out recently, and our neighborhood public school, which is filled with some of the city’s poorest kids, scored very low. I have to believe there is something seriously wrong with how the school is educating kids. (Otherwise, the school, which we know fairly well through volunteering, seems perfectly fine.) My wife and I both work full-time and also care for her mother and disabled sibling, so we know that we can’t put in the kind of time that would be required to turn the school around. We also fear that we cannot teach our son enough outside school hours to make up for a significant deficit in his education.

The farmer, Wilbur Tennant of Parkersburg, W.Va., said that his cows were dying left and right. He believed that the DuPont chemical company, which until recently operated a site in Parkersburg that is more than 35 times the size of the Pentagon, was responsible. Tennant had tried to seek help locally, he said, but DuPont just about owned the entire town. He had been spurned not only by Parkersburg’s lawyers but also by its politicians, journalists, doctors and veterinarians. The farmer was angry and spoke in a heavy Appalachian accent. Bilott struggled to make sense of everything he was saying.

In my early 20s, I developed a gambling problem that I’ve since learned to spread out over a variety of low-stakes games — Scrabble, pitch-and-putt golf, my stock profile on ETrade. I watch somewhere between six and 20 hours of basketball per week. I try to keep up with the usual cultural things — documentaries about conflict in South Sudan, Netflix binge shows, memes — but whenever I find myself awake in the early morning and there is no email to answer and no news to track, I watch SportsCenter, or I scan the previous night’s N.B.A. box scores to check up on Porzingis, or I read some dissertation on Johnny Cueto’s unusual ability to hold runners on first base. It’s not the most glamorous way to spend my time, but what can I do? My mind, at its most aimless, obsessively seeks out sports information.

But look again, a directive that is implicit in all Motus productions; imagine these letters connected by vowels.

2016-01-06,"Hindu Heroes, Savored Through Fantastical Masks at the Met","It’s a short step from religious ritual to theater, and barely any distance at all in the case of certain popular Hindu dramas of southern India. Performed during seasonal festivals, they are epic in length — they go on for hours, often through the night — and fantastic in character, telling the stories of gods who have the adventure-filled lives of superheroes. You get a vivid sense of this proto-“Star Wars” mood in “Encountering Vishnu: The Lion Avatar in Indian Temple Drama” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met recently acquired five large 18th-century wooden masks created for a play about the god Vishnu who, in the guise of the lion-man called Narasimha, visited earth to defeat an evil king and restore order to the universe. The masks are stupendous, and paintings and prints that the Met has placed around them flesh out a tale that, even today, can inspire devotional rapture under the stars.

The artists broadcast their message in paintings of speed and flight, in antagonistic theater pieces that frequently ended in fistfights and eventually — as would happen perhaps only in Italy — in a cookbook. “We will now establish the way of eating best-suited to an ever more high-speed, airborne life,” declared their leader, Filippo Tomasso Marinetti. The “Futurist Cookbook,” published in 1932, detailed multisensory scenarios and the anarchic dishes and drinks that composed the artists’ dinners — events for curious guests and journalists, witnesses to the Futurist demands to refashion Italy from art to plate.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/t-magazine/food/milan-futurist-cocktails-grappa.html

2016-01-07,Venezuela: New Lawmakers Defy Supreme Court," Lawmakers on Wednesday swore in three legislators who were blocked from taking their seats by the Supreme Court last month, setting up a showdown with the president’s Socialist party. The opposition won a supermajority in the National Assembly on Dec. 6, ending the United Socialist Party’s 16-year-long grip on power. But before the new legislature could take charge, the Socialists approved 13 new Supreme Court justices, and days later, the court blocked four opposition lawmakers from taking their seats. That decision has created uncertainty about the supermajority, which the president’s rivals need to gain added powers, including the ability to remove Supreme Court justices and change the Constitution. On Wednesday, three of the four politicians were sworn in over objections of the Socialists. “What’s happening today is a flagrant violation of the Venezuelan Constitution,” said Diosdado Cabello, a Socialist lawmaker and the former leader of the Assembly. He said that the Socialists would ask the Supreme Court to find the Assembly leadership in contempt of the court order that blocked the politicians from taking their seats.

The main exhibition, “A Constellation,” includes the work of 26 artists and focuses on themes of abstraction, the figure and the history of the African diaspora. “Black: Color, Material, Concept” continues the conversation around blackness initiated by Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the museum, who introduced the term “post-black” into the cultural conversation almost 15 years ago with the exhibition “Freestyle.” In the basement, a sculptural installation by Marc Andre Robinson weaves together formalism with black cultural history, while another, “Lorraine O’Grady: Art Is … ” offers a fantastic exhibition of photographs documenting Ms. Grady’s performance piece during the 1983 African-American Day Parade, in which she skillfully weaves together art, activism and participation.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/arts/design/at-the-studio-museum-in-harlem-4-shows-engage-a-cultural-conversation.html

2016-01-08,Inside the List,"Sugar and Spice: Every year around this time, when people are still recovering from the holidays and the main hardcover lists have settled into deep-freeze mode — a single new entry in the past four weeks! — it has become traditional for Inside the List to wander a little afield. Sometimes we reprint a list from years past. Sometimes we ask best-selling authors for their book-related wish lists or resolutions. This year, we bring you cookies: specifically, Rosanna Pansino’s atom cookies, from “The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook,” at No. 5 in its second month on the food and fitness list (available online). Pansino belongs to the growing club of YouTube stars who have crossed over into publishing; her online baking show, also called “Nerdy Nummies,” has more than three million subscribers who watch her take goofy delight in treats like doughnut waffles. (These are, literally, store-bought glazed doughnuts, heated and pressed in a home waffle iron. I’m not sure that qualifies as baking, but it sounds amazing.) If you suspect that Pansino’s appeal has as much to do with charm and presentation as with the actual recipes, her book probably won’t change your mind. But she is charming, in her way. Here’s how she introduces those atom cookies, which are just six-pointed sugar cookies iced and decorated to resemble a science class’s atom model, with an M&M nucleus and candy pearl electrons: “Atoms are the building blocks of every type of matter in the universe — even you! My grandfather was a nuclear physicist, my uncle followed in his footsteps, and my dad’s old high school even had an atom on its emblem. I guess you could say we have an atomic bond. I decorated my atoms green, blue and purple, but you can make your atom cookies any color you want.

Christa Wolf won acclaim for her nuanced critiques of the now defunct Communist dictatorship, though her reputation took a beating with her admission that she had served as a ­Stasi informant. Heiner Müller’s scathing dramas challenged the authoritarian regime and earned him scorn as a “historical pessimist.” Then there was Wolfgang Hilbig, born in Saxony in 1941, who shoveled coal in a factory boiler room before discovering his true calling. Permitted to resettle in West Germany in 1985, he began attracting attention for his evocations of the East’s apocalyptic postwar landscape and the dislocations of a Cold War-era émigré who felt like an outsider in both societies.

And when that collision occurs through an act of violence, it’s sometimes assumed that other differences can be ignored — because, after all, what life has been lived without some pain and suffering? At best, such stories come across as saccharine odes to our shared humanity. But in a novel like Elizabeth Day’s tale of contemporary London, “Paradise City,” they can seem to exploit the circumstances of the less fortunate and the marginalized.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/paradise-city-by-elizabeth-day.html

It’s a feeling supported by a common story about ­history: The anti-abortion movement began after Roe v.

What else could explain the movement’s swift rise in the decade following the Supreme Court’s decision, if not a widespread reaction against equal rights?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/defenders-of-the-unborn-by-daniel-k-williams.html
2016-01-08,Dave Hickey’s ‘25 Women: Essays on Their Art’,"“Most of my favorite people are women,” Dave Hickey proclaims in the introduction to “25 Women.” This statement, and indeed the whole book, can be read as a response to the accusations of sexism that have followed Hickey since the culture wars of the ’90s, when he published “The Invisible Dragon,” a series of cantankerous essays attacking the academic art establishment. According to Hickey, beauty, once the handmaiden of art, had been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness by a censorious ring of tenured apparatchiks. Hickey’s antagonists fought back. For the feminist critic Amelia Jones, his “revival of an abstract notion of ‘beauty’ ” served to validate “a particular group of critics (almost all white men) as having access to the truth.” For its critics, beauty was hardly innocent or self-evident, but hampered with cultural baggage: the objectification of women, the exclusion of minorities and the meretricious seductions of the marketplace.

Lauer, the deputy director of the Poetry Society of America and author of the poetry collection “A Hotel in Belgium,” begins his memoir with a ringing phone; the call (or, as he later refers to it, “The Phone Call”) is from a woman he doesn’t know, informing Lauer that his wife is having an affair with her husband. “Who was that?” Lauer’s wife asks from the couch, and the memoir’s first story line — an archaeological dig in the ground of marital infidelity and its aftermath — is underway.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/fake-missed-connections-by-brett-fletcher-lauer.html

Norrell","In 1977 Alex Haley, the author of the best-selling “Autobiography of Malcolm X,” achieved world renown after ABC broadcast an eight-part version of his book “Roots,” published the previous year to great acclaim. “Roots,” which chronicled Haley’s search for his African ancestors (and in doing so created a template for the genealogical boom reflected in popular series like “Finding Your Roots,” with Henry Louis Gates Jr.), became an international phenomenon that turned the financially insecure Haley into an icon. Yet Haley’s newfound celebrity and wealth proved to be a double-edged sword. Allegations of plagiarism and historical inaccuracies scarred him, diminishing his literary reputation, and, argues the historian Robert J. Norrell in his briskly paced “Alex Haley: And the Books That Changed a Nation,” unfairly tarnished the author of “the two most influential books on African-American history in the second half of the 20th century.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/alex-haley-and-the-books-that-changed-a-nation-by-robert-j-norrell.html

Not so. The event itself came rather late for Mei Fong’s “One Child.” But she makes disconcertingly clear that the repercussions of population control will continue to reverberate throughout China.

A key player in the death agony of Rome’s traditional republican system of government, he was lauded by his admirers as a defender of constitutional propriety and dismissed by his foes as a vacillating opportunist. Posterity has proved similarly conflicted. While America’s founding fathers revered him as a model of civic duty, he was excoriated by the most formidable German classicist of the 19th century, Theodor Mommsen, as a precursor of that lowest class of writer, a “newspaper columnist.” A person’s attitude to Cicero can often be most revealing.

Hyundai blamed a malfunctioning sensor on the electronic stability control system, which is supposed to detect if the vehicle is sliding in a direction at odds with how the steering wheel is turned. The recall is necessary because the sensor may activate the electronic stability control when it is not needed, “increasing the risk of a crash,” the automaker told regulators. Hyundai said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Some owners began complaining to regulators as early as 2013. “It feels as if the auto is driving on flat wheels or on ice,” a New Jersey owner wrote in 2013.

But some Socialist candidates filed lawsuits challenging the results and in one of those the court responded by halting the swearing in three lawmakers. The new Assembly leaders condemned that ruling as an attempt to undermine the new majority and swore the three opposition candidates in anyway. The summary of the Monday decision posted on the court’s website said all decisions made while the three members were “incorporated” into the Assembly would be void. The Assembly has said it will push legislation this week to free a number of prisoners who lawmakers who they say are being held for political reasons and will pursue laws to reduce the influence of Mr. Maduro’s administration.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/world/americas/venezuela-court-held-lawmakers-in-contempt.html

(And if you can’t get enough of the young photographer’s work, check out his contributions for T.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/t-magazine/art/zane-zhou-summer-photographs.html

2016-01-15,"Review: In Michael Bay’s ‘13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,’ Clarity Isn’t the Objective","Slipped into “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” among the torrential bullets and convulsive mayhem, is a protracted advertisement for a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. A dramatization of the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Libya that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, the movie is a pummeling slog — 45 minutes of setup and an eternity of relentless combat. So it’s a relief when the director Michael Bay, amid this bleak fusillade, provides a little zigzagging action-movie-style relief. You can’t help but admire how well the truck holds up with its wheels aflame, like a 21st-century chariot of fire.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/movies/review-in-michael-bays-13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-clarity-isnt-the-objective.html

The Dream Chaser will be able to land like a plane on a runway, allowing payloads like scientific experiments to be unloaded within a few hours. The three contracts, which run through 2024, when the space station is scheduled to be retired, have a maximum value of $14 billion, but NASA officials said they did not expect to spend nearly that much.

But then I also agree with the observers who think Trump fundamentally had a good night as well: The Donald has learned a lot about debating since this show started, and even when placed on the defensive he was effective and disciplined — responding to Cruz on the Canadian issue with more puckishness than bluster and then pivoting smoothly to 9/11 on the “New York values” issue. And then there was this moment, when a question about Nikki Haley’s post-SOTU critique of the party’s “angriest voices” allowed Trump to deliver — pretty calmly and evenly — what was probably the line of the night, if not of his campaign: “She did say there was anger. I’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/they-have-not-yet-begun-to-fight/
2016-01-15,"‘City of Thorns,’ by Ben Rawlence","In 2010, Ben Rawlence, then a researcher for Human Rights Watch, visited the refugee camp of Dadaab on the eastern Kenyan border, home to 300,000 people, many of whom had fled the chronic civil war in Somalia. The next year, he returned for what would be the first of seven long visits to follow the lives of nine of its inhabitants and to watch the camp grow until it became the largest refugee settlement in the world, more town than camp, with its own hospitals, cinemas and soccer teams, occupying an area the size of New Orleans. It would be good to be able to say that his story is encouraging or uplifting; but Rawlence’s “City of Thorns” is a deeply disturbing and depressing portrait of the violence, destitution, fear, sense of hopelessness and neglect in which a large number of the world’s estimated 60 million forcibly displaced people now live.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/books/review/city-of-thorns-by-ben-rawlence.html

2016-01-15,Inside the List,"The List Awakens: Alan Dean Foster’s movie novelization “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” goes right to the top in its first week on the hardcover fiction list. This isn’t the only best seller to spring from Disney’s reboot — an illustrated junior novelization has spent three weeks on the middle-grade hardcover list, where it’s currently No. 2, and other titles have landed on the kids’ series list and the miscellaneous list — but it is the first “Force Awakens” tie-in to hit adult hardcover. So what, besides Chewbacca’s drunken sex scene, makes this an adult book? (I’m only kidding about Chewie — sorry! — but readers curious about the mating habits of wookies can turn to The Guardian, where an Edinburgh zookeeper reports that “I would assume they would do it pretty much the same way we do it.” If you’re like me, this will have you humming Cole Porter for days.) In fact, Foster’s novelization does contain some scenes of graphic violence missing from the movie, but the most adult thing about it may be the florid vocabulary. Here’s how it describes the villain Kylo Ren, for instance: “saturnine of aspect, lithe of build, tortured of mien and troubled of eye.” Keep the children away.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/books/review/inside-the-list.html

While not every teenager is a violin prodigy, Etta’s situation shares common themes with the lives of many driven young people, and right from the opening moments of “Passenger” there is much to like about her. When Etta’s elderly teacher, the most supportive figure in her life, becomes suddenly discouraging on the night of the recital, and Etta overhears an argument between her teacher and her mother as she is about to go onstage, the dramatic tension is ratcheted up, promising an engaging narrative about ambition and family.

A timely follow-up to last spring’s contemporary-focused “Cuba Libre!” exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, David Zwirner’s “Concrete Cuba” offers one of the first looks at the island’s pre-revolutionary art, with a comprehensive show of the sculptures and paintings of Los Diez Pintores Concretos (the Ten Concrete Painters), a group of geometrically inclined artists that operated under that collective moniker for a brief moment between 1959 to 1961. Taking up the second story of the gallery’s 20th Street tower, the historical work has a pleasingly human scale.

Key Jr. identified the Democratic defeat as “so demoralizing and so thorough that the party could make little headway in regrouping its forces until 1916.” The scale of this Republican success — a moment that ushered in a period of Republican Party ascendance that lasted until the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 — draws the attention of the prominent political strategist Karl Rove, who also views McKinley’s victory over the charismatic William Jennings Bryan as pivotal. Rove is in awe, rightly so, of McKinley’s political achievement, and his richly detailed, moment-by-moment account in “The Triumph of William McKinley” brings to life the drama of an electoral contest whose outcome seemed uncertain to the candidate and his handlers until the end.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/books/review/the-triumph-of-william-mckinley-by-karl-rove.html

McGinty. McGinty, who is in the midst of a heated Democratic primary race, appeared decidedly unhappy to be handling the case. When he presented himself to the TV cameras on Dec. 28, he shifted from foot to foot and often looked fixedly at his prepared statement.

The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don’t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything — a product, a service, a corporate acquisition — that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards.

That made the question of whether he was merely mythical a topic every curious child had to investigate. My own research resulted in a habit of mind I’ve carried with me all these years, swinging between a creeping horror at all the unsettling supernatural realities most adults are too thick-headed to even acknowledge, and that feeling that comes after a good debunking — a mixture of emotional comfort, intellectual pleasure and condescending pity aimed at the still benighted myth-believers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/books/review/dear-yeti-and-the-thing-about-yetis.html

2016-01-22,"Three’s a Trend: Big, Baggy Pants","Volume has been a big theme at the men’s shows this season, with several collections featuring oversize silhouettes and exaggerated proportions. Big fur coats popped up in London, and already throughout the first two days of Paris Fashion Week, designers including Y/Project and Raf Simons have shown extra-large knits and coats with long, trailing sleeves. But perhaps the most practical interpretation of volume is evident in slouchy pants — which this season have been cut wide through the legs. At Rick Owens, the baggy style (complete with cargo pockets) resembled that of a ’90s raver. Christophe Lemaire deftly balanced his creased-front trousers with tailored coats, while Dries Van Noten paired a double-breasted blazer with generous trousers. And at Gosha Rubchinskiy, sweatpants — worn high, à la Al Bundy — came with a tucked in T-shirt and military shirt.

Movingly, over three acts, it takes us on a great arc of emotion and experience, capturing the play’s themes of death and regeneration, hostility and reconciliation. When it takes liberties with aspects of the story, it does so persuasively.

When he shows up for a summer holiday with his three grown sisters, driving a vintage Jaguar and wearing a white linen suit, accompanied by his glamorous new wife and his lovely 16-year-old daughter by a previous marriage, you might expect Roland to have earned a little domestic peace and adulation. But no. Not only do his sisters, who “could remember him in short trousers, when his ­glasses were mended with sticking plaster,” still consider him a ­“buttoned-up” puritan, but his sway over his wife and daughter is about to be assailed from the most unexpected quarters. The point about the past, in Hadley’s fiction, is that it’s always there to trip you up.

Kirk’s book was an event. After a recommendation from Whittaker Chambers, Time magazine devoted the entire book review section to it. And Kirk had other gifts. He was a capable writer of ghost and fantasy novels. He founded and edited two prestigious journals. Not just Strauss and Chambers but also T. S. Eliot and Ray Bradbury esteemed him.

From the very beginning, Bryson, an American from Iowa who has lived and worked and established a family on the far side of the Atlantic, has responded to his British surroundings with an irresistible mix of frustration and fascination. That first travelogue was inspired by what turned out to be a temporary move back to the United States. This new one, which begins with Bryson taking a challenging (and, he mischievously observes, not entirely accurate) test to qualify for dual citizenship, has him questioning how much he really understands modern Britain, “a country that I don’t altogether recognize.” Has he just become older and crankier? Or have the places he first knew as a young man really changed?

The employee, Nooshafarin Ravaghi, had taught English as a second language at the jail since July. At least one of the escapees, Hossein Nayeri, attended her class, and the two developed “some kind of relationship,” said Lt. Jeff Hallock, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. Ms. Ravaghi, 44, provided Google maps and other help for the escape, Mr. Hallock said, but she has denied providing tools used in the escape. The three men cut through metal bars before rappelling from the jail’s roof using a makeshift rope. Investigators believe the three men may be in a white GMC utility van, which was stolen in Los Angeles on Saturday.

Another couple can be glimpsed seated at a table, a glass of wine in front of the woman and a cocktail (it looks like a Manhattan) set before her date. I was surprised to see that Motley named the painting ‘‘Blues.’’ The heavy-souled sadness I associate with that music seems at odds with the image — but Motley must have known it was in there, too.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/magazine/drinking-with-archibald-motley.html

(Mayer goes where the facts take her: She had previously written a similar article about George Soros’s influence on liberal causes.) “It’s uncommon for a private detective to be hired to conduct a retaliatory investigation into a reporter’s character,” she writes in the book, adding that although it’s unclear how directly involved they were, “clues leading back to the Kochs were everywhere.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2016-01-29,"‘Margaret Thatcher,’ by Charles Moore","In February 1984, during that period when a succession of decrepit Soviet leaders were dropping like flies, the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, traveled to Moscow to attend the funeral of Yuri Andropov. There she made an extremely positive impression on her hosts. Not only did she remain outside in frigid temperatures during the entire ceremony, but her personal security man, who shadowed her in his vast overcoat with immense bulging pockets, drew many admiring glances. “Russian security were deeply impressed by this heavily armed man,” one British official recalled. When, however, Thatcher returned to the Kremlin, she removed her own coat and unzipped her fur-lined boots, “whereupon Detective Superintendent Parker produced a pair of high-heeled shoes from his pockets.” A firearm or a stiletto: Both seemed to have potential in the hands of a leader the Soviets had once christened the “Iron Lady.” But the story is indicative of the way the matter of her gender would often surprise and unsettle Thatcher’s contemporaries.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/books/review/margaret-thatcher-by-charles-moore.html

The wonder is that whether it’s for preschoolers or for teenagers, each in its own way presents a coherent picture of her. Getting a handle on the Democratic presidential candidate’s swerving, crowded life is a challenge for any biographer, and turning her into a subject for children seems yet more daunting. Even putting aside her husband’s PG-13 affair with an intern, it’s still not clear what the ending of Hillary’s story will be. (As of now, no children’s books about the other candidates are on the horizon.)

On Monday, Nate Parker’s “The Birth of a Nation” premiered to rapturous applause — and by Tuesday morning, it had been rewarded with a blockbuster deal. Fox Searchlight bought the film for a reported $17.5 million, besting the previous Sundance record — held by 2006’s “Little Miss Sunshine” — by over $7 million. And by noon that day, after waiting in line for over an hour at a press screening of the film only to be stopped tantalizingly close to the front, I had missed the movie completely.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/t-magazine/entertainment/sundance-eight-best-films.html
