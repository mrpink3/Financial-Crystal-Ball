One the one hand, it includes a real Democratic concession, which substitutes a top income rate threshold of $400,000 for the $250,000 threshold that President Obama had long insisted on. But at the same time, for liberals seeking progressivity and fairness, that should be the easiest possible concession to make. The $400,000 threshold still puts the top bracket close to where it was under Bill Clinton when you adjust for inflation, and that Clintonian definition of “rich” wasn’t an implausible one: While the whining of the upper upper middle class (or, if you prefer, the not-that-rich rich) can be unseemly, there really is a big difference between a taxpayer making six figures annually and a taxpayer making seven or eight, and setting the top rate in the mid rather than low six figures is a way of acknowledging that the near-rich and super-rich do not occupy the same financial universe.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/liberalisms-400000-problem/

I should not have been — I had read that he grew up outside of Dallas — but I had just watched him act in two films, “Killing Them Softly” and “Argo,” in which he disappears so fully into two very different characters, I had all but forgotten he came from anywhere. You don’t expect a chameleon to speak with a twang. In “Killing Them Softly,” directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Brad Pitt, McNairy plays one of three guys who rob a mob-protected card game. In “Argo,” directed by and starring Ben Affleck, and based on real events, he plays one of six American diplomats who were extracted out of revolutionary Iran in an outlandish C.I.A. scheme that had them pretending to be a Canadian film crew. McNairy, 34, shifts shapes again in “Promised Land,” a Gus Van Sant movie that opened Dec. 28, and, if these films are any indication, he’ll do so again in “Twelve Years a Slave,” directed by Steve McQueen and due out this year. But don’t call him an overnight success. Between long days of shooting yet another major feature, “Non-Stop,” starring Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson, McNairy spoke to T about muddying accents, the art of riding mechanical bulls and what he terms his “slow, slow break.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/asked-answered-scoot-mcnairy/

He created “Nutcracker!” in 1992, and, in 1995, “Swan Lake” which, as even nondance fans know, boasted a corps de ballet of virile male swans and enjoyed enormous international success. Mr. Bourne’s work remains extremely popular, particularly in Britain, where his company, New Adventures, has the kinds of lengthy runs and huge audiences more associated with Broadway than ballet. “Sleeping Beauty,” for example, opened Dec. 4 and runs through Jan. 26 at Sadler’s Wells, where Mr. Bourne is an associate artist. There are good reasons for Mr. Bourne’s success. He is a masterly storyteller. He is brilliant at finding a kernel of emotional truth in, and a fresh approach to, familiar dance narratives that make them resonate in new ways.

Another was that we were walking corpses. We’d been on the subject of death for a while. A friend I loved very much died recently, and I was trying to describe the state I sometimes still found myself in — not quite of this world, but each day a little less removed — and how I knew it was a good thing, the re-entry, but I regretted it too, because it meant the dimming of a kind of awareness that doesn’t get lit up very much. I was having some trouble articulating it, but Saunders was right there, leaning in and encouraging. He has a bushy blond mustache and goatee going gray, and sometimes, when he’s listening intently, he can look a little stern, as if he just stepped out of a tent at Antietam. But then he starts talking and the eyebrows go up and it’s all Chicago vowels and twinkly Doug Henning eyes, and if you didn’t know that he was more or less universally regarded as a genius, you might peg him as the superfriendly host of a woodworking show on daytime public access.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/george-saunders-just-wrote-the-best-book-youll-read-this-year.html

(And for more thoughts on marginalia, see Sam Anderson’s first Riff column.) “My Mother’s Bible,” which appears on Byliner, is hard to categorize.

In other words, objects exist within a web of associations and relationships that are utterly personal, but also — at times — bewilderingly universal. Sasamoto, whose work was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial, makes these connections visible through networks of cords and cables that demarcate lines across spaces and between repeated motifs like lemons and doughnuts. In her performances, she frequently wields a thick marker to draw whirlwind diagrams of coincidence or alliances, as if she were an unusually aggressive math teacher (the field in which she began her studies). The relentless pace of her narration is matched in her nimble and mercurial movements; her installations often act as room-size jungle gyms, from which she effortlessly folds, wraps or dangles her body, navigating around her audience.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/aki-sasamotos-lines-of-reasoning/

The broad goals of less spending and lower taxes were clear enough, but on anything more specific the politicians and activists on the grassroots right seemed confused about what they thought the party should to be negotiating toward, or what they expected that their calls for harder hardball and/or cliff-diving would actually win in the end. (The scenarios being spun out tended to either envision extracting never-gonna-happen concessions from the Democrats across weeks of brand-destroying brinksmanship, or embracing a truly massive defeat on taxes as a “the worse, the better” step toward eventual conservative resurgence.) This confusion was obvious throughout, but particularly during the brief window on Tuesday when there was talk of House Republicans sending the bill back to the Senate with some amendments tacked on. If there had been any kind of strategically-plausible consensus about how conservatives actually wanted the compromise amended, then that gambit might have made some sense.

As Ben Schrank intimates in his energetic new novel, “Love Is a Canoe,” even writers who exude calm and wisdom often hide wounded souls.

In actuality, the intellectual landscape is so fragmented that highly literate Americans may not know of this prolific Harvard historian, the recipient of two Pulitzers, a National Book Award, a National Humanities Medal and a Bancroft (the most important professional prize for American historians). Bailyn’s most influential work probably still is his “Ideological Origins of the American Revolution” (1967), which forever changed views of our nation’s beginnings. But my favorite is “The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson” (1974), a superb portrait of the last royal governor of Massachusetts, a conscientious but obtuse public servant whose inability to grasp his subjects’ resentments led to his becoming the most hated man in the colonies.

2013-01-04,Cost of Care,"When I finished this novel, I didn’t want to review it; I wanted to reread it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears. Jojo Moyes, the writer who produced this emotional typhoon, knows very well that “Me Before You” — a novel that has already floated high on Britain’s best-seller lists — is, as British critical consensus affirms, “a real weepy.” And yet, unlike other novels that have achieved their mood-melting powers through calculated infusions of treacle — Erich Segal’s “Love Story” comes immediately to mind — Moyes’s story provokes tears that are redemptive, the opposite of gratuitous. Some situations, she forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/me-before-you-by-jojo-moyes.html

2013-01-04,Displaced Persons,"“Life Goes On” is both a very good first novel and a chilling reminder of the Nazis’ success at destroying Germany’s rich literary culture for a generation, if not longer. The author, Hans Keilson, wrote this lightly fictionalized account of his life about 80 years ago, when he was in his early 20s. To give just one example of how much the world has changed since then: Keilson tells us in an afterword that the impetus to start the novel was the fury he felt after he’d been turned away as a patient by the powerful Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. (A few years later, the institute would be taken over by a cousin of Hermann Goering, and most of its analysts would flee to Palestine.) The publisher, the great S. Fischer Verlag, accepted the novel for publication in December 1932. The extremely poor and extremely elated Keilson took his advance and went skiing for the first time in his life. When he came back, the Reichstag was on fire, the Nazis had begun arresting Communists, and the publisher told Keilson to change his ending, which had a Communist twist. The novel appeared, with the altered ending, in 1933. It was banned in 1934. And that is the story, Keilson explains in the afterword, of “the last debut by a Jewish writer from the old S. Fischer Verlag.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/life-goes-on-by-hans-keilson.html

The blog became “Will’s Mary Anne ­Schwalbe News.” When Mary Anne decided it would be “easier” if she composed the first entry, she dictated in the third person for Will to type and post — a practice that continued until the blog’s, and Mary Anne’s, last days.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/the-end-of-your-life-book-club-by-will-schwalbe.html

Winnie’s ex-husband is a celebrity game-show host who wants to be a “serious” actor, with a yoga-teaching trophy wife and a longing for his surfing days. Their teenage daughter keeps busy resenting her mother and fabricating outrageous abuse stories for an older, online boyfriend she’s never met. Winnie herself, meanwhile, is stalled out in the center of a featureless plain of middle-aged torpor, with few desires or ambitions.

Five-year-old Robbie Whitcomb lives one form of that nightmare when he’s snatched from the parking lot of a mall in Ypsilanti, Mich., by a whiskered man who attacks the boy’s mother and drives over her in his van, leaving her a “pitiful broken thing.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/daddy-love-by-joyce-carol-oates-and-more.html

It was the clearest indication yet from the government of how it plans to handle the increasingly likely possibility that Mr. Chávez will be unable to return before then from Cuba, where he had cancer surgery last month and is said to be gravely ill. Because Mr. Chávez was re-elected, his presidency will continue uninterrupted even if he is not sworn in on the specified date, Mr. Maduro said as he held a tiny copy of the Constitution in a television broadcast. He accused members of the political opposition of trying to overthrow the government because of their insistence that Mr. Chávez’s absence on Jan. 10 would require the head of the National Assembly to temporarily assume the presidency — even though the Assembly leader and Mr. Chávez both belong to the United Socialist Party.

The most plausible recent example of such a bargain is the deal that George H.W. Bush struck with Congressional Democrats in 1990, which brought him so much grief and helped inspire a generation of Republican resistance to tax increases: That compromise promised to cut $500 billion from the deficit over five years, which (per my back-of-the-envelope adjustments for inflation) is the equivalent of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over ten years today. $2.5 trillion is a big number … but it’s only slightly more than the combined deficit reduction promised by last year’s debt-ceiling deal and this month’s tax increases combined — and that combination, of course, has only put a very modest dent in our long-term deficit problem.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/a-world-without-grand-bargains/

As prepared in Alba, fillet of beef is hand cut and dressed with olive oil, lemon and maybe anchovies and shavings of white truffle. But the evening before the tasting, I had a different type of carne cruda, also perfect with dolcetto, at Commerce, in the West Village. Harold Moore, the chef and a partner, seared beef deckle and served thin slices, still raw in the center, over charred mushrooms, with a light salad garnish, a shot of spice and a drizzle of ponzu, a citrus-flavored soy sauce. He calls the dish “toro” because it’s similar to his preparation for seared tuna. Can’t find a butcher who sells tasty beef deckle, the rib cap? A hunk of fillet will do just fine.

The letter was signed by deans at Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins and nine other universities. The C.I.A. has admitted hiring a Pakistani doctor to give out hepatitis B vaccine, apparently in an effort to get DNA samples from the compound that it suspected was Bin Laden’s hide-out. That has caused a severe backlash against vaccination in Pakistan. Nine polio vaccinators have been shot dead, and the effort to fight polio there was halted for weeks. Deaths from measles also soared in 2012, to 306 from 64 the year before. Resistance to measles vaccine in the populous Sindh province was blamed.

When a comrade and someone in the other camp engage in the same behavior, your praise or blame should be independent of the personal feelings you may have for either. Don’t give your friends a pass you wouldn’t give to your enemies.

2013-01-08,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE THREE STOOGES (2012) Will Sasso stars as Curly, Sean Hayes is Larry, and Chris Diamantopoulos is Moe (pictured above, from left) in this fictionalized origin story for the mostly lovable fools, and paean to the art of the eye poke, from Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Divided into “episodes,” the tale follows the Stooges from infancy — when they’re tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David) — to adulthood, when they’re forced to try to save the orphanage in which they were reared from the faltering economy and other calamities. Jane Lynch plays the Mother Superior who sends them out into the world, where they meet a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) and her lover (Craig Bierko); the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa); and some of the cast of “Jersey Shore.” “The three leads in ‘The Three Stooges’ play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: “Much of the pleasure in ‘The Three Stooges’ comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming.

2013-01-09,Sudan: Top U.N. Aid Official Warns of Food Crisis in 2 Southern States,"The director of United Nations emergency relief implored the Security Council on Tuesday to find ways to ensure his aid teams can gain access to two isolated southern states of Sudan. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped there because of a conflict between rebels and the Sudanese government, which has accused the newly independent country of South Sudan of abetting an insurgency. The relief director, John Ging, told reporters afterward that he feared that many residents in the isolated states, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, might be dying of malnutrition and disease, while others were subsisting on roots and leaves. “This is 2013, and to think that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are living in such desperate and deplorable circumstances, and we can’t get in to help them as humanitarian organizations, it’s just not acceptable,” Mr. Ging said. The United Nations and aid groups have accused Sudan of denying them access to the two states. Sudan’s United Nations ambassador, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, told reporters that rebels were responsible for any impediments to aid.

2013-01-09,Iran: Ayatollah Discourages Talk of Vote’s Fairness," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, said its enemies would most likely try to sabotage the presidential election scheduled for June. He warned citizens and prospective candidates to avoid discussion about the fairness of the vote, suggesting that such talk was subversive and would discourage turnout. “Where on earth have elections been so free as in Iran?” he said in a speech in the holy city of Qom, reported by the state-run press. “Watch out for your words not to dissuade people.” His statement, coming five months before the vote for a successor to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, appeared to reflect the ayatollah’s concern about repeating the chaotic aftermath of the 2009 election, in which Mr. Ahmadinejad, his favored candidate, won by a suspiciously lopsided margin that opponents said was fraudulent. Postelection protests escalated into the most serious challenge that the Islamic government had faced since it took power in the 1979 revolution. Mr. Ahmadinejad’s two challengers have remained under house arrest for the past few years.

2013-01-09,The Breakfast Meeting: Super Bowl Ads and a Bet by HBO on ‘Enlightened’,"CBS said on Tuesday that it had sold all the available commercial time for the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVII on Feb. 3, unless a marketer wants so much to be included that money is no object. According to estimates by agency executives, CBS has sold most of its Super Bowl spots for an average of $3.7 million to $3.8 million for each 30 seconds. (By comparison, the average for Super Bowl XLVI, broadcast by NBC on Feb. 5, 2012, was $3.5 million.) Leslie Moonves, chairman and chief executive of the CBS Corporation, made the announcement at an event at the CBS Broadcast Center on the West Side of Manhattan that was billed as Super Bowl XLVII Media Day. Mr. Moonves, as Stuart Elliott reports, said room could still be found to include commercials for movie studios — which often wait somewhat longer than other marketers to decide whether to buy Super Bowl commercials — but at a price. “If one of those movie companies wants to come in and pay five or six million,” he said, “we will find room.”",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/the-breakfast-meeting-super-bowl-ads-and-a-bet-by-hbo-on-enlightened/

The moment would be low in light, yet high in tension, so securing a cinematographer who could effectively shoot in near darkness was essential for Ms. Bigelow. She decided on Greig Fraser, an Australian director of photography who shot two other 2012 releases: “Snow White and the Huntsman” and “Killing Them Softly.” Those films also used darkness and light in interesting ways but were  more stylized in their approach. Mr. Fraser was recently honored by the New York Film Critics Circle  for his work on “Zero Dark Thirty.”",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/below-the-line-the-light-and-dark-of-zero-dark-thirty/

Period.” New Yorkers should hold him to that promise.

He also wants mental health professionals to be able to report if someone is dangerous, allowing law enforcement to confiscate the individual’s firearms.

Close behind were “Argo,” about political captivity; “Amour,” a French-language film about aging and dying; and “Django Unchained,” a tale of slavery and retribution. “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which chronicles a child’s encounters with rising floodwaters in the bayou, and “Zero Dark Thirty,” about the murky pursuit of a national enemy, also received best picture nominations.

Styron would go on to graduate — he was a nice boy, and eager to please his doting father — but he wasn’t kidding about his monomaniacal focus on writing, and in many ways the early pages of this splendid book are the hardest. They are very earnest, albeit not in the Hemingway sense — that is to say, there’s nothing here about getting one’s leg nearly blown off in Italy or falling in love with one’s nurse or trout fishing in Michigan. In the young Styron’s case, it was all but entirely about the writing. Happily, his diligence soon bore fruit: by Page 21 his mentor at Duke, William Blackburn, has already brought Styron’s work to the attention of Hiram Haydn, the editor at Bobbs-Merrill who would eventually publish Styron’s first novel, “Lie Down in Darkness,” in 1951, when the author was only 26.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/books/review/selected-letters-of-william-styron.html

2013-01-11,What’s On Friday,"10 P.M. (TMC) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) Michelle Williams, above, in an Oscar-nominated role, steps into the pumps and pencil skirts of Marilyn Monroe, and Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark, a documentary filmmaker who claimed to have spent an intimate interlude with her in 1956 while they were making “The Prince and the Showgirl.” This film, an adaptation of his diaries, also features Kenneth Branagh, in another nominated role, as Laurence Olivier, Monroe’s co-star and director, whose infatuation and ego clashes with Monroe caused him to call her “the stupidest, most self-indulgent little tart I’ve ever come across.” When the shoot went from bad to worse, he told her: “Just be sexy. Isn’t that what you do?” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, “He didn’t get Monroe, and she is similarly out of the grasp of this movie,” adding: “Ms. Williams tries her best, and sometimes that’s almost enough. She’s too thin for the role, more colorlessly complected than creamy, but she whispers and wobbles nicely.” Still, Ms. Dargis said: “The problem isn’t Ms. Williams or the serviceable work of the director, Simon Curtis, but a script by Adrian Hodges that hews faithfully to Clark’s clichés. Instead of the complex woman familiar from the better books about her, the film offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes: child, woman, smiling exhibitionist, shrieking neurotic, the barefooted free spirit and, lamentably, the martyr teetering in heels toward her doom. The tragic Monroe is obviously dramatic, but the intimations of disaster don’t fit a movie that works so hard to be breezily, easily likable.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

Bolivians also use the plant as a tea, in medicines and in religious or social rituals. The government of President Evo Morales withdrew from the international agreement a year ago as it sought an exception for traditional uses of the plant within its borders. The change was a diplomatic victory for Mr. Morales, above. To block the change, 62 United Nations members would have had to object; only 15 did, including the United States.

Mr. Pattinson’s portrayal of a passionate, potentially dangerous husband capable of sexual rough play “shifts the story into another world,” said Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times. “Mr. Condon works in that world fluidly, gilding it with a necessary sense of humor — Bella and Edward’s white honeymoon bed glows as portentously as an altar for a sacrificial virgin — and imbuing it with a love and a gift for melodrama. He slathers on the music (‘melodrama’ comes from song or music drama), lets Ms. Stewart rock and the emotions roil. He resurrects the awkward teenage yearning that enlivened the first ‘Twilight’ movie, but also transforms that initial, crude hunger into something deeper. Mostly, he brings Bella toward her happily-ever-after by giving this movie over to her, her dreams and her desires, as in a cosmic montage sequence worthy of ‘The Tree of Life,’ but, you know, shorter. Edward may finally change Bella, but it’s Mr. Condon who resurrects her.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

And “dulce de leche,” the Argentine milk caramel, first appeared in English in 1923 but was not more commonly used until a good 80 years later. These are just two of more than 2,000 words or terms crammed into this compact volume. There are some surprising gaps, like “acai,” the popular Amazonian berry; or “vadouvan,” a kind of curry that’s showing up on menus more often; or “guanciale,” the Italian cured pork cheeks. The perspective is more British than American, but what is offered is useful and fascinating. For example, who knew that there were not one but two terms for turtle meat: calipash and calipee, which refer to different parts of the animal? And that lamb’s wool was a warmed spiced beer with apple that Samuel Pepys mentioned as a nightcap in 1666?",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/dining/new-dictionary-has-origins-of-dining-terms.html

Green tea, bitter dark, mild milk and white are some of the options, all made with fresh cream from farms near the factory in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost region. The sliver of a boutique sells less than half of the varieties Royce’ makes, but they include novelties like potato chips covered with fromage blanc, cocoa-dipped marshmallows and flat chocolate squares called Prafeuille with gooey fillings of honey, berries and caramel. Ken Romaniszyn, the company’s American partner and an owner of Lady M Cake Boutique uptown, said Royce’, which was founded in 1983 and has stores all over Asia, is poised to add two more shops in New York in the spring, on 40th Street opposite Bryant Park and on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village.

2013-01-16,What’s On Wednesday,"8 P.M. (Sundance) MONSOON WEDDING (2002) An extended Punjabi family works through its issues as it prepares to celebrate the arranged marriage of a daughter (Vasundhara Das, above left, with Shefali Shetty) — who has been carrying on an affair with a television host — and her betrothed (Parvin Dabas), who lives in Houston, in this film directed by Mira Nair. Naseeruddin Shah plays the father determined to pull off a wedding he cannot afford. Vijay Raaz is the wedding planner, who nervously eats marigolds. “ ‘Wedding’ often has the energy of a Bollywood spectacle, with its ingratiatingly incongruous shuffles of genres; we even get a handful of musical numbers, including a warm, offhanded song on the pleasures of married life performed by a group of women,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. “The agile handling of the soap opera elements — conventional plotting at best — finally makes ‘Wedding’ a pop, facile take on Capulet versus Montague stuff, likable but square.” He added: “Like the monsoon rains that temper Delhi’s summer heat, this movie offers subtle surprises. When ‘Wedding’ captures the small, hilarious skirmishes of a culture at war with itself, and the families trying to hold their ground against change, it is enchanting.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

In 1974, at 10 years old, I landed a thrill of a summer job as one of the kids in “Cat” — those “no-neck monsters” as Tennessee Williams so memorably called them. My parents had responded to an ad for open auditions at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. I was offered the role, the production turned out to be a hit, and we transferred to New York the following fall.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/theater/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-was-my-introduction-to-acting.html

2013-01-17,Solving Bus Strike’s Impact on Special Needs Students Isn’t Simple,"New York City’s bus strike is disproportionately affecting one of its most vulnerable populations: children with special needs, whose symptoms or travel limitations can make it extremely challenging for their parents to get them to school using other methods of transportation. Marie Myung-Ok Lee, who has written for about the challenges and joys of raising a child with developmental disabilities, including autism, in New York City, reminded me yesterday that children like her son depend on continuity and predictability in ways that children without his symptoms do not. And many children in the city’s special education programs present particular challenges for bus drivers and their aides. They may be prone to violent tantrums, or need physical help. It’s a different job, and a different relationship, than the phrase “bus driver” immediately suggests.

I grew up quickly, learning to plan daily activities with precise schedules and strategies for getting from one place to another, while trying to maintain some semblance of the life I’d enjoyed.

2013-01-18,"This Realm, This Engla Land","After Richard III, last of the Plantagenets, was slain at Bosworth Field in 1485, his body was said to have been taken to the church of Grey­friars in Leicester, but after that nothing reliable is heard about what became of it. “He is the only English king, after the time of the Normans, who has never been placed within a royal tomb,” Peter Ackroyd writes in “Foundation,” his rambling, affectionate new history of the remote English past. In September, archaeologists from the University of Leicester dug up a parking lot at the long-razed Grey­friars site and found, well preserved as if by a carefully wrapped shroud, the bones of a man whose skull had been hacked open and whose spine was curved, as Richard’s was said to have been.

He’d been telling me another story about his youth on the farm, and he was grinning at the time. I could feel Jim Harrison grinning the same way in his glorious novella “The River Swimmer,” which celebrates the manifold lessons of that heady year by following the outsize adventures of 17-year-old Thad, a strong, dreamy farm boy who is inexorably drawn to water.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/books/review/the-river-swimmer-by-jim-harrison.html
2013-01-18,Second Selves,"In an interview that was published in Bomb magazine a couple of years ago, a journalist admitted to Adam Phillips, the British psychoanalyst and writer, that though he loved Phillips’s many books and essays, he could “never actually remember anything” that he read in them. Phillips was delighted. “That’s the reading experience I’ve always loved. Certainly, when people say to me, as they often have done, ‘I can’t remember anything afterward,’ I think, Great, that’s the point!”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/books/review/missing-out-by-adam-phillips.html
2013-01-18,Up Front,"Sheila Heti, who reviews Adam Phillips’s “Missing Out: In Praise of the Unlived Life” in this week’s issue, shares his interest not only in unlived lives but also in the lives of others. “Writing fiction is a good way to inhabit other minds, if not other lives,” Heti said in an e-mail. Her most recent novel, “How Should a Person Be?,” is told from the perspective of Sheila, a young playwright eager to make art and attain fame, who is not to be confused with the author — at least not completely. For the Sheila of the novel, being famous is synonymous with being blessed. “In a religious context, you’re blessed because God watches over you, but in the secular context the biggest thing that could watch over you is everybody,” Heti explained. “She mistakenly imagines this ‘blessing’ will absolve her from being in difficult and painful relationships with others, and instead she can just kind of float along, untouched and beloved.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/books/review/up-front.html
2013-01-18,Louise Glück’s Metamorphoses,"Poetry has always been the handmaiden of ­mythology, and vice versa. Sometimes poets are in the business of collecting and tweaking existing myths, as with Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” and the Poetic Edda. Other times poetry applies a mythological glamour to stories and characters from history, legend or even other myths (the hero of the “Aeneid” is a minor character from the “Iliad”). Then there are poets who equate the idea of myth with the supposedly irrational essence of poetry itself. Here is Robert Graves in 1948: “No poet can hope to understand the nature of poetry unless he has had a vision of the Naked King crucified to the lopped oak, and watched the dancers, red-eyed from the acrid smoke of the sacrificial fires, . . . with a monotonous chant of ‘Kill! kill! kill!’ and ‘Blood! blood! blood!’ ” Which might sound more like a strip club picnic gone badly awry, but you get the idea.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/books/review/louise-glucks-metamorphoses.html
2013-01-18,Road Ready,"In January 1949, Jack Kerouac failed to appear for an afternoon date with a woman called Pauline. He had told Allen Ginsberg he planned to marry her — “the finest woman I’ll ever know” — once she had unshackled herself from her truck-driver husband, who, according to Joyce Johnson, was accustomed to “slapping her around to keep her in line.” In the meantime, Kerouac began an affair with Adele Morales (later to become the second Mrs. Norman Mailer). His failure to keep the rendezvous with Pauline, however, had nothing to do with affection for Adele; rather, he had overslept after a night of sex games with Luanne Henderson, whom Jack’s muse Neal Cassady had married when she was 15, and who, according to their friend Hal Chase, was “quite easy to get . . . into bed.” The tryst had been engineered by Cassady, who was hoping to watch, Johnson says, to show Luanne, by then 18, “how little she meant to him.” Two days later, Kerouac called on Ginsberg and found Luanne “covered with bruises from a beating Neal had given her.” Johnson describes Kerouac as “shocked” by the sight; nevertheless, “they all went out to hear bebop,” partly financed by money stolen by Cassady. In response to being jilted, Pauline confessed her affair to her husband, who tried to burn her on the stove. Kerouac described her in his journal as a “whore.” All the while, Ginsberg can be heard in the background: “How did we get here, angels?” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/books/review/the-voice-is-all-by-joyce-johnson.html

And in the honorable tradition of the watch commander known as the Oracle in Joseph Wambaugh’s Hollywood Station procedurals, every veteran seems to feel duty-bound to take one last crack at an unsolved murder before he retires.

2013-01-18,Jan. 20 — 26,"THOUGH Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had many Broadway successes — “Oklahoma” and “South Pacific” among them — their 1957 musical version of “Cinderella” was made for television and, until now, has never been produced on Broadway. But “RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN’S CINDERELLA,” while promising to honor the soaring romance of the original, features a new book by the witty Douglas Carter Beane (“ Xanadu,” “Lysistrata Jones”) that includes some modern touches and, we can assume, a quirky twist or two. (The show’s Web site features the tag line “Glass slippers are so back.”) Laura Osnes (“Bonnie and Clyde”) plays the title role — Julie Andrews did the honors in the 1957 version — and Santino Fontana (“The Importance of Being Earnest”) will portray her rather neurotic prince. The rest of the company includes Harriet Harris as Cinderella’s stepmother and Victoria Clark as her fairy godmother, with Mark Brokaw (“The Lyons”) directing. Previews begin Friday.

According to the photographer, Brad Farwell, the pedestrians he observed at four different Manhattan locations — the Bowery, Midtown, NoLIta and the Lower East Side — were much the same. But the time they spent looking at themselves differed, depending on the day. Sunday Downtown was a time for leisurely strolling and reflecting on what they saw in the mirror. On a weekday in Midtown, though, “the looks were the most unguarded, because they were so much quicker,” Farwell says. “The checking themselves out wasn’t about ego. It was more of an appraisal. They were sort of looking at themselves as they really were.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/new-yorkers-caught-checking-themselves-out.html

2013-01-21,Carl Sandburg Poem Discovered,"Except for the smudgy typewriter strokes, it reads like up-to-date social commentary: a poem on the fearsome power of a gun. But the brief work was composed some nine decades ago by a literary giant, Carl Sandburg, and until days ago, scholars had no idea it existed. For years Ernie Gullerud, a volunteer helping to create a digital archive of Sandburg’s voluminous output at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has pulled a poem from a folder, recorded its title and first and last lines, and then moved on to the next page. But last week, a short poem, “The Revolver,” caught his attention. “I said, ‘Hey, this is as pertinent today as it was then,’ so I brought it to the librarians,” said Mr. Gullerud, 83. After consulting with experts, the staff of the university’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library concluded that it was a genuine, unpublished and unknown work. “The paper is his paper, and the typewriter is his typewriter,” Valerie Hotchkiss, the library’s director, said. Sandburg scholars think the poem dates to the 1920s, or perhaps earlier.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/books/carl-sandburg-poem-discovered.html

With a libretto and music by Bernice Johnson Reagon and Toshi Reagon, and a story and book by Jacqueline Woodson, “Zinnias” also reunites Mr. Wilson with Sheryl Sutton, the performer who starred in the provocative “silent opera” “Deafman Glance,” which brought them both a lot of attention in the 1970s. Mr. Wilson and Ms. Sutton were interviewed together at Mr. Wilson’s downtown Manhattan studio; Mr. Wilson was also interviewed between rehearsals and by telephone.

2013-01-23,The Liberal Hour,"I naturally preferred my own version of President Obama’s second inaugural to the speech he actually delivered yesterday, but the substance of the two was roughly similar. The president clearly feels that his re-election both reflects and ratifies a larger leftward shift in American politics: His address reached backward to ground this new progressive era in the American past, offered explicit nods to the demographic groups and constituencies whose present-day growth has made it possible, and then sketched out an agenda suited to a more left-of-center future — climate change legislation and green industrial policy, a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the universalization of gay marriage, new gun control laws, etc. It was not a speech designed to co-opt opponents of this agenda, to put it mildly — particularly those opponents whose control of the House of Representatives will make this agenda difficult to implement. But those of us who watched his negative, joyless re-election campaign and assumed that this president would begin his second term as a lame duck were only half-right. While there’s still good reason to think that Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishments are in the rearview mirror, the fact that he could win a clean victory despite the grim economic backdrop seems to have given him more confidence in the staying power of his coalition, and the continuing short-term impediments to his agenda in Washington seem to have liberated him to play for the longer term instead.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/the-liberal-hour/

2013-01-23,‘Gospel of Intolerance’,"Raised in Pennsylvania, I grew up in the black church. My father was a religious leader in the community, and my sister is a pastor. I went to church every Sunday and sang in the choir. But for all that the church gave me — for all that it represented belonging, love and community — it also shut its doors to me as a gay person. That experience left me with the lifelong desire to explore the power of religion to transform lives or destroy them. I became interested in Uganda, an intensely religious country that attracts many American missionaries and much funding from United States faith-based organizations. The American evangelical movement in Africa does valuable work in helping the poor. But as you’ll see in this Op-Doc video, some of their efforts and money feed a dangerous ideology that seeks to demonize L.G.B.T. people and intensifies religious rhetoric until it results in violence. It is important for American congregations to hold their churches accountable for what their money does in Africa. ",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/opinion/gospel-of-intolerance.html

Of course, that almost never happens. Mostly we’re happy if we can manage to explain, in an interesting way, something people already know is going on. But Betty Friedan won the gold ring. When “The Feminine Mystique” emerged in 1963, it created a reaction so intense that Friedan could later write another book about the things women said to her about the first one (“It Changed My Life”). If there’s a list of the most important books of the 20th century, “The Feminine Mystique” is on it. It also made one conservative magazine’s exclusive roundup of the “10 most harmful books of the 19th and 20th centuries,” which if not flattering is at least a testimony to the wallop it packed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/magazine/the-feminine-mystique-at-50.html

Instead, they’ve created software that puts that power in the hands of consumers, a process Huang calls “fashion design for the Instagram generation.” Shoppers logging on to constrvct.com can upload a photograph that will later be translated into a print, choose from a variety of basic silhouettes (the sheath dress is currently the most popular), then plug in their measurements. Three weeks later, a dress arrives in the mail, a time scale Huang estimate will be cut by two-thirds once the partners raise the funds to bring production in-house. Soon, pre-existing images will be available for selection, with royalties going to the artists who created them. And plans are afoot to add further customizing options like neckline, sleeve and hemline choices. “We don’t even need to make a pattern,” Huang says. “We can make the dress directly from the 3-D model. It’s basically you press the button, we make the dress.

2013-01-24,The Bristol Palin Effect vs. The Roe Effect,"Naomi Cahn and June Carbone, whose book “Red Families, Blue Families” I’ve written about favorably in the past, have a new piece for Slate making the case that the continuing rise in out-of-wedlock birth rates is an unintended consequence of the pro-life movement’s modest success at stigmatizing abortion. The piece starts by acknowledging a connection that social conservatives often have reason to point out: The biggest reason why blue states often have lower out-of-wedlock birth rates than more conservative states is that the blue states have higher abortion rates, and the relative stability of the “blue model” of post-sexual revolution family life — which is really the upper middle class blue model, in which serial monogamy in your late teens and twenties is followed by late marriage and parenting — depends on a “willingness to abort” as well as a facility with contraception. But where pro-life writers like myself tend to raise this point in order to cast doubt on the comforting-but-dubious idea that liberal policies will inevitably lower the abortion rate, Cahn and Carbone invoke it to cast doubt on the idea that one can simultaneously be opposed to abortion and in favor of stable two-parent families. After all, if a “willingness to abort” helps keep out-of-wedlock birth rates low among well-educated blue staters, then surely opposition to abortion can plausibly be held responsible for the steady rise in single parent households in the rest of the country — and especially in white, conservative-tilting middle America:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/the-bristol-palin-effect-vs-the-roe-effect/

In any case, shortly after a young poet named André Breton issued his first Surrealist Manifesto in 1924 the movement and the medium — aided and abetted by a large cohort of talented artists and writers — joined forces, to extraordinary mutual benefit. That art continues to reap the fruits of this union is one of the many lessons of “Drawing Surrealism,” a sensational exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum.

2013-01-25,Independent Voices Drown Out the Buzz,"PARK CITY, Utah — This year’s Sundance Film Festival, marked by aesthetic ambition, a formidable female presence and enough on-screen sex to take the chill off, gives optimistic proof of the state of American independent cinema. Under the affable, low-key leadership of John Cooper, who took over as festival director in 2009, Sundance has firmly settled into a groove, one that places movies above buzz. Celebrities, freebies and brands remain part of the clamorous mix — after the premiere of his experimental short “Interior. Leather Bar.” James Franco laughingly said that he had picked up his red Christmas sweater from Dockers — but, as at other screenings, there was more to that night than stargazing.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/movies/highlights-of-the-sundance-film-festival.html

Investigators said Mr. Kekhman was not a target of the investigation. The Joint Fruit Company filed for bankruptcy last year after creditors sought repayment of the loans.

(IFC) ABOUT A BOY (2002) In Paul and Chris Weitz’s adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel Hugh Grant plays Will, a London Lothario with a Peter Pan complex who must face up to his irresponsible ways when Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the socially inept 12-year-old son of a hippie-dippy single mother (Toni Collette, above, with Mr. Grant, right, and Mr. Hoult), begins to stalk him. Rachel Weisz is the artist on whom Will fixes his sights; he uses Marcus to help seduce her. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that “Mr. Grant, leaning on his mumbling charm until it turns into its opposite, is an ideal cad.” Like “High Fidelity,” another of Mr. Hornby’s works, “ ‘About a Boy’ finds redemption in a stale, gooey pop song, in this case Roberta Flack’s ‘Killing Me Softly,’ ” Mr. Scott added. “It’s a cheap trick, but one that’s guaranteed to work every time. You succumb to the movie’s warmth and bonhomie because the alternative is to remain in the isolating, self-protective cynicism from which Will has been lucky to escape.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2013-01-25,Ends of the Earth,"This past summer I found myself traveling with a strange man straight out of Melanie Challenger’s book “On Extinction.” He was an Alaska homesteader, firefighter and fishing guide, and for a week he led me down a remote rivulet in Alaska’s interior. The ostensible purpose of our trip was to fish the biggest remaining sockeye salmon run in the world and at the same time to make a case for opposing what would be the continent’s largest open-pit mine to be built atop said salmon run. But the more I tried to establish a narrative about this man, the more he broke up my effort with a kind of wilderness attention deficit disorder. No sooner had he hunched over to differentiate the identities of the shades of sage and white in the blooming tundra than he would hear the call of a ptarmigan. This in turn would lead to a discourse on the connection between migrations and snow melt and the desperation of grizzly bears in particularly snowy years. He was so profoundly knowledgeable, and everything he said felt incredibly nuanced and relevant. But at the same time his accounts were often tedious and circular and without any “point” that an impatient New Yorker could discern.

More recently there have been Anthony Burgess’s “Dead Man in Deptford” and Robin Chapman’s “Christoferus,” both published in 1993, the 400th anniversary of Marlowe’s death, as well as “Tamburlaine Must Die” (2004) by the Scottish thriller writer Louise Welsh.

The bill will allow same-sex couples who have formed a civil partnership (legal since 2004, with legal rights equivalent to those of marriage) to convert the partnerships to marriage, and enable married people to change their legal gender without having to end their union. The Church of England has raised concerns that it could be forced to conduct same-sex marriages against its will, but Ms. Miller said the bill would exempt clergy who have a conscientious objection from having to carry out the ceremonies.

Linguistic purists have noted that “dièse” is, in fact, a musical term meaning “sharp symbol” and that the word “croisillon,” which means “hash symbol,” might have been a better choice. In any case, for the moment French Twitter users still “tweet” — “tweeter” in French (pronounced “twee-tay”) — when they post messages to the service. Many have been posting snarky notes about the new word under the hashtag “#motdièse.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/europe/france-striking-a-blow-for-the-mother-tongue.html

2013-01-28,Germany: Funds for Global Health Fund Reinstated," Signaling that it was pleased with changes in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Germany announced Thursday that it would reinstate the annual pledge of 200 million euros (about $267 million) it had made since the fund’s early days. In 2011, Germany temporarily held back half its contribution and threatened to hold back future funds in protest against inefficiencies, thefts by some grantee countries and infighting among the fund’s top executives. Other contributions dried up, forcing the fund to cancel a planned round of grants. Since then, both the fund’s executive director and inspector general have departed, and it was run for one year by a Brazilian banker; he devised an overhaul of the grant-making process that is to take effect next month. In November, Dr. Mark Dybul, the Bush administration’s global AIDS czar, became the new executive director. The fund recently announced that it cut its operating expenses by 5 percent in 2012 while still making 26 percent more in grants than it did in 2011. Of the grants that had been audited, Dr. Dybul said, only 0.5 percent had been lost to fraud. The fund plans a new fund-raising round for later this year. The United States is the fund’s largest supporter, providing roughly a third of its budget.

2013-01-28,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (Sundance) SECRETARY (2002) Maggie Gyllenhaal, right, portrays Lee Holloway, a repressed young secretary with masochistic tendencies and a stint in a mental hospital who blossoms during spanking sessions with her boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a grim lawyer who prefers the typewriter to the computer. Spelling mistakes result in corporal punishment, and soon Edward, like a cruel Pygmalion, is telling Lee how to dress, answer the telephone and even eat. But his instructions help shape and direct her life — and his advances set her aflame. “Secretary,” directed by Steven Shainberg and adapted by Erin Cressida Wilson from a novella by Mary Gaitskill, could be seen “as a slap in the face to orthodox feminist thinking, since the concept of sexual harassment doesn’t seem to occur to anybody.” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “I prefer to see ‘Secretary’ as a wacky new-wave romantic comedy in which two lonely people locked inside their private fantasies discover a miraculous erotic harmony. In today’s post-Freudian, do-your-own-thing era of free sexual expression, the movie stands to be a wholesome self-help fable about the unlocking of shame and its magical transformation into pleasure and personal liberation.

City workers, accompanied by police officers, arrived shortly after midnight at the little park that Azerbaijan’s embassy had paid to renovate.

Talks are continuing with Azeri officials to find a new home for the statue. As to whether the embassy wants its money back for the park renovations, the city government’s legal director, José Ramón Amieva, told the local news media on Saturday that the city had not yet received a request for reimbursement.

Ten other defendants received suspended sentences. One of the six, Dr. Harmut Hopp, fled to Germany in 2011, and the German government has denied Chile’s requests for his extradition. Mr. Schäfer founded the self-sufficient religious sect in 1961 after fleeing West Germany, where he was accused of sexually abusing boys. He died in prison in 2010 while serving a 20-year sentence for the sexual abuse of 25 minors at the sect’s compound. Colonia Dignidad also served as a clandestine torture center during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, according to official human rights reports.

2013-01-29,What’s On Tuesday,"9 P.M. (13, 49) HENRY FORD “American Experience” chronicles the life and times of Ford, from his childhood on a Michigan farm in the 1860s and his dream of becoming a machinist in Detroit to his pursuit of racecar driving, the winnings from which allowed him to incorporate his Ford Motor Company. The result was the revolutionary Model T, a lightweight, durable and fast automobile that cost $850 at a time when the average car sold for more than $2,000. Soon the company was producing 1,000 cars a day. Taking its cue from the meatpacking industry, the company established the first automobile assembly line and controlled nearly half of the American car market. Ford, above with the Model T, also paid a $5 daily wage to reduce turnover, with strings attached. Immigrant workers had to attend the company’s English-language schools, and inspectors from the “sociological department” would delve into their private lives. As Ford became one of the richest men in the world, he found his hatred for the wealthy elite increasing; he allied himself with the common people. But as his ego expanded, so did his anger. Ford blamed Jews for the country’s problems, bullied those who worked for him and displayed withering cruelty toward his only son, Edsel, who died at 49 — a death many blamed on the unrelenting stress of trying to please his father.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

2013-01-30,The Spy Novelist Who Knows Too Much,"Last June, a pulp-fiction thriller was published in Paris under the title “Le Chemin de Damas.” Its lurid green-and-black cover featured a busty woman clutching a pistol, and its plot included the requisite car chases, explosions and sexual conquests. Unlike most paperbacks, though, this one attracted the attention of intelligence officers and diplomats on three continents. Set in the midst of Syria’s civil war, the book offered vivid character sketches of that country’s embattled ruler, Bashar al-Assad, and his brother Maher, along with several little-known lieutenants and allies. It detailed a botched coup attempt secretly supported by the American and Israeli intelligence agencies. And most striking of all, it described an attack on one of the Syrian regime’s command centers, near the presidential palace in Damascus, a month before an attack in the same place killed several of the regime’s top figures. “It was prophetic,” I was told by one veteran Middle East analyst who knows Syria well and preferred to remain nameless. “It really gave you a sense of the atmosphere inside the regime, of the way these people operate, in a way I hadn’t seen before.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/magazine/gerard-de-villiers-the-spy-novelist-who-knows-too-much.html

2013-01-30,Tune in To | Rachel Zeffira,"Rachel Zeffira is nothing if not a lateral thinker. When she was 17, a bureaucratic error nearly resulted in her deportation from Britain and caused her to lose her place at a music school in London. So Zeffira, who is from Canada, reinvented herself as a 26-year-old substitute French teacher (“a language I don’t speak”) and stayed in England until she raised enough money to continue her studies in Verona, Italy. Years later, when she and her bandmate from Cat’s Eyes, Faris Badwan (the frontman of the Horrors), were looking for a venue to play their first gig, she used the contacts she’d made in Italy to secure an appearance at a Vatican Mass attended by several cardinals. “I told them we were a choir,” she says. “They thought our backup singers looked a little too sexy. At the last minute we had to rush out and buy opaque tights and shawls.” In her latest example of creative adaptation, the classically trained soprano and multi-instrumentalist has melded sacred music with a baroque pop sensibility on her debut solo album, “The Deserters.” It was released late last year in Britain (the North American release, on Paper Bag Records, is scheduled for March) and is earning rave reviews, with the BBC memorably describing it as “tummy meltingly wonderful.” Dreamy, seductive and sparse, “The Deserters” has a quiet lushness that’s markedly different from the girl-group-tinged sound of Cat’s Eyes, though Zeffira hesitates to specify how. “I like to leave it to the listener to describe the music,” she says. “I don’t like it to be spelled out.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/tune-in-to-rachel-zeffira/

Sprague, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for passport services. “That gives them the potential to get in more trouble,” she said. “But now they’re better able to keep in touch with us, and we with them.” Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Sprague on what help the State Department can offer you abroad.  ",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/travel/going-abroad-how-the-state-department-can-help.html

Pope Benedict, Marxist?","Like his predecessor John Paul II, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the German phenomenologist Max Scheler, and wove a keen understanding of philosophical history into encyclicals like “Fides et Ratio”, Pope Benedict XVI also seems quite comfortable engaging in philosophical debate. Judging by his interactions with Jürgen Habermas, among others, one might assume that the Pope stands for a political and theological conservatism quite at odds with Marxist tradition. Yet they, and indeed Benedict himself might be surprised to find that, as a post at First Things explains, he evidently has his admirers on the left. Four Italian “Ratzingerian Marxists” of the “Old Left” have issued a “manifesto” hoping to enlist the Pope in their fight against a “consumerist-inflected secularism.” Strange bedfellows? Maybe not, considering that a few close readers of Benedict’s 2007 encyclical “Spe Salvi” have noted that the Pope cites Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno to help refute the plausibility of the thesis that, with the waning of theistic belief, “man himself is now called to establish justice.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/stone-links-jane-austen-aristotelian-pope-benedict-marxist/

Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington play the agents as young adults. “The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller,” A.

Despite rising interest in and scholarship about folk art — and even after the wholesale rethinking of several major American wings on the East Coast — the isolation of folk from academic is still the norm. Given that we live in a time of eroding aesthetic boundaries and categories, when many curators are experimenting with integrative approaches in international biennials and commercial galleries, it seems past time for the folk-academic division to soften. It undoubtedly has at some institutions, especially those with modest collections. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/arts/design/american-folk-vs-academic-art.html

For the first time in its 20-year history, it occupies a building retrofitted for art: the clean, well-lighted spaces of the former Dia Art Foundation. This places it in the western reaches of Chelsea, once again confronting the world of contemporary insider art with irrefutable proof that the most lasting work comes from unstoppable emotional necessity, an especially useful lesson for the moment.

2013-02-01,Addictive ‘Soy Sauce’ With Ruinous Power,"You shouldn’t think of the title of “John Dies at the End” as a spoiler in the conventional sense, thought there is a character named John and, well, you know. This movie, written and directed by Don Coscarelli and based on a novel by Jason Pargin (writing under the pseudonym David Wong), is not really about John (Rob Mayes), in any case, and is either entirely spoiler-proof or completely self-spoiling. It lays waste to linear narration, thematic coherence, psychological plausibility and just about everything else you might expect to encounter. It zigs, zags and trips over its own feet and on its own home-brewed hallucinogens. It’s a ridiculous, preposterous, sometimes maddening experience, but also kind of a blast.
