Forgo slippery rubber treads; instead, grip opposite sides of the tree with the soles of your bare feet. The only equipment you’ll need is a short piece of strong cloth or rope tied in a circle. Make a figure-eight shape and put a loop around each ankle; the rope keeps your feet together and close in, allowing your knees to splay apart and preventing your legs from wrapping around the tree. “Always check your knot,” Fiapa’i says. Hop up. To propel yourself upward, bend your knees into a frog-like squat and then repeatedly leap, feet together. Use your dominant hand to help pull your body up while your other hand hugs the tree to keep you from falling.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/magazine/how-to-climb-a-coconut-tree.html

But nothing could be further from the truth. It’s all craft. And a lot of it! If you find as much meaning as I do in the painstaking details, you will find the project rewarding, especially because you can set it on fire and clap and giggle and then eat the damned thing. So maybe it’s not at all like a poem, in the art sense, where you do all that exacting work but then at the end realize it ought to be torched, and you go to bed without applause and still hungry to boot.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/magazine/ice-cream-cake-baked-alaska-meringue-pistachio-cake-lemon-semifreddo.html

Given that only 13 percent of employees in the private sector in this country get any kind of compensated leave to care for young children, this was considered a laudable investment in sanity. There was, however, a crucial fine-print dimension to the order. By “employees,’’ the mayor was referring only to those 20,000 or so public workers belonging to the managerial class and not the hundreds of thousands of other individuals — educators, lunchroom attendants, police officers, librarians, park rangers, computer programmers, court reporters and so on — who are represented by unions and make up a vast majority of the municipal labor force.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/nyregion/paid-parental-leave-except-for-most-who-need-it.html

2017-12-01,Louise Erdrich on Pregnancy and Who Controls Women’s Bodies,"EXPECTING: Louise Erdrich’s new novel, “Future Home of the Living God,” drops off the hardcover fiction list after debuting last week at No. 13. As a work of straight-up science fiction, imagining evolution out of whack and the climate in (more) acute crisis, the book represents something of a departure for Erdrich. But she’s cooking with familiar ingredients: Ojibwe identity, the Minnesota landscape and — especially — sexual politics, as the government asserts a claim on pregnant women’s bodies. “I wanted to explore what a public creature you become when you’re pregnant, how everybody puts their hands on you,” Erdrich told Bethanne Patrick in The Los Angeles Times last month. “You’re vulnerable to an extreme degree when you’re pregnant.” To that end, the novel grapples openly with questions of choice: not necessarily abortion, since Erdrich’s pregnant heroine wants her baby, but with women’s freedom to control their biological destiny. “It’s so obvious to me that anti-choice rhetoric isn’t about religious faith,” Erdrich told Patrick. “That’s just a way for people to frame what they’re doing in a way that is palatable for them. Anti-choice is about controlling women’s bodies period. It’s about seizing control of young women.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/louise-erdrich-on-pregnancy-future-home-living-god-best-seller.html

The book is, no surprise, every bit as rowdy as the movie. Haddish grew up in foster care in South Central Los Angeles, and for a time had a job as an “energy producer” at bar mitzvahs, where she was paid to dance enthusiastically and encourage other guests to have a good time. (“I was basically the Flava Flav of bar mitzvahs.”) In one memorable chapter, she explains how that gig led to a sideline pimping out her male friends. “If you’re doing bar mitzvahs, you’re going to meet old Jewish ladies,” she writes. “They started telling me how lonely they were and saying things like, ‘My husband’s not satisfying me.’” When one woman showed Haddish her collection of romance novels — “She had one that was like a slave thing or whatever. It was a big, strapping black guy on the cover, holding this passed-out white woman” — Haddish was inspired. “I don’t know any slaves,” she told the woman, “but I could probably hook you up with somebody big and strong.” Word spread, and Haddish thrived until the men realized they could cut their own deals without her. That’s O.K. She’s found other ways to put her people skills to lucrative use. On the copyright page, her publishers suggest stores file the book under “Biography and autobiography / Rich and famous.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/books/review/tiffany-haddish-last-black-unicorn-best-sellers.html

But the compensation was to discover how many others felt the same way. The appreciations became a rare public conversation about poems rather than about Poetry, and what it is or isn’t (as in last year’s exhausting brouhaha over Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize) or whether it’s “dead,” or corrupted by elitist obscurism, or replaced by popular music, or secretly thriving. On social media, people posted their favorite Ashbery poems and passages, like this one from 1977’s “The Other Tradition,” which might seem to refer to those cyclical debates: “They all came, some wore sentiments / Emblazoned on T-shirts, proclaiming the lateness / Of the hour … ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/books/review/rupi-kaur-instapoets.html

2017-12-19,Alka Pradhan v. Gitmo,"The Galaxy 19 is a communications satellite that orbits over North America, beaming free-to-air programming to hundreds of thousands of households. It also happens to be the way detainees at Guantánamo Bay get their television. The satellite carries a wealth of religious programming, from “Bible Explorations” to “God’s Learning Channel” to “Global Buddhist Network” — not a lineup well tailored to the particular viewing interests of the Gitmo demographic. What detainees tend to be most interested in is current events, and among the news channels that the satellite carries, RT is one of the most popular. So for lawyers who want their Guantánamo clients to see that their interests are being represented, RT is probably the best option. For that reason, in 2014, a young defense lawyer named Alka Pradhan became a frequent guest on the channel. And because Pradhan is technically an employee of the Department of Defense, her appearances constitute one of countless idiosyncrasies of Gitmo: a contractor for the United States military using a Russian propaganda channel while working for Qaeda terror suspects.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/magazine/alka-pradhan-v-gitmo.html

Various group members also offered to drive the kids to soccer, only to find that on nights when the girls were to participate, the parents always made some excuse about why their daughters couldn’t go. It didn’t take long for us to realize that in their family, girls aren’t allowed to participate in programs outside of the home, a decidedly nonegalitarian attitude if there ever was one. Here’s the dilemma: There are those who don’t want to enroll any of the children in future recreational programs because of the family’s highly conservative attitudes toward females. Others feel that this would make the group guilty of imposing its value system on a refugee family and, by extension, just end up hurting the young sons. Who’s right?

For one project, she offered subjects a stay in a four-star hotel. After conducting some sham experiments, everyone went to bed only to be awakened before dawn by a call from the front desk telling them the building was on fire. This, of course, was the real experiment. “In a fire, you need to evacuate quickly, but that’s not what we see,” Kobes says. Instead, people put on their shoes, got dressed, searched for their keys and repeatedly peered out their door into the hallway. Stalling before exiting is what evacuation researchers call the “premovement phase.” Don’t prolong it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/magazine/how-to-escape-a-burning-building.html

2017-12-22,Harriet Tubman’s Hymnal,"In 2010, a church hymnal that once belonged to Harriet Tubman — the American abolitionist hero who, after escaping slavery in 1849, devoted her new freedom to leading hundreds more of her fellow enslaved out of captivity, first as a conductor on the underground railroad and then later as a Union spy — was donated to the National Museum of African American History and Culture by the collector and historian Charles L. Blockson. Given to him by Tubman’s great-grandniece Mariline Wilkins (the daughter of Eva Stewart Northrup, whose signature is inscribed inside the book’s cover), it was just one of dozens of Tubman’s belongings bequeathed to the museum that day. Eric Williams, the curator of religion at the Smithsonian’s Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, considers the book particularly revelatory, given that Tubman was illiterate. “This idea of having a sacred book and not being able to read it,” he said in a phone interview, “that’s a window into her piety. And it is in line with a longer tradition one finds in the black religious experience in North America.” Although many black men and women, whether enslaved or free, could not read them, he explained, “these books — the Bible and hymnals — bore witness to the liberating power of the Gospel contained within their pages.” Williams told me that for Tubman, who could sing every word it contains, this hymnal would have been “invested with a spiritual power,” and that it is a text to be valued “not just as literature but as artifact — as an object of devotion.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/books/review/harriet-tubman-hymnal.html

2017-12-29,Behind the Lens of ‘The Things They Loved’,"I had heard of the “anniversary effect,” or the pain of a traumatic event returning as its calendar date comes back around. My father died on Dec. 16, 2016, so my own anniversary effect was in full swing when I began this project. At each door, I was met by a person who had stepped up when needed — who had recently lost someone but hadn’t yet finished taking care of them. After a while, I stopped being surprised by everyone’s sense of humor and warm, present, tense clarity of purpose: I related to it. It was the common denominator with everyone I met, probably because it is the prerequisite — or perhaps the reward — for being the person who steps up before and after a loss. Each circumstance was different, but my intention was to honor each absence by describing vitality and presence wherever I could find it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/magazine/behind-the-lens-of-the-things-they-loved.html

I’ve had any number of such moments — what some people would call “ah-ha” moments — on the subway lately. A day or so before the “all thumbs” revelation, I was reminded once again that I am what used to be called “getting on in years”: I was standing in a crowded car when my eye happened to catch the eye of an attractive young woman who was seated in front of me. She smiled. I smiled. I was on my way to thinking that maybe she had me confused with George Clooney — a mix-up that, I’ll admit, does not occur on a regular basis.
