The delay will enable Russian importers to identify alternative suppliers, he said. Officials are not considering a ban on industrial imports at this time, said Igor Shuvalov, another deputy prime minister. The list of banned items might be expanded in the future, officials said. Among the measures already announced are limits on travel and tourism between the two countries. Russia has spent almost $750 million on importing Turkish fruits and vegetables so far this year, according to government statistics, and Turkey accounted for about 4 percent of all foodstuffs purchased abroad in 2014. About 90 percent of all lemons sold in Russia come from Turkey, as well as significant amounts of tomatoes, grapes and apricots. About 1,250 Turkish trucks are now stacked up along Russia’s southern border, Interfax reported.

Ever since the Babylonians scratched two parallel lines and a circle — representing the Euphrates River and their walled capital — on a clay tablet almost 3,000 years ago, we humans have been producing flat spatial imagery to locate our place in the world. Maps anchor us, give coherence to our environment, help make visual sense of otherwise intangible realities. The most skillfully done maps, moreover, can be thrilling to look at, elevating cartography into art. Renaissance mapmakers filled the borders of their works with beautifully rendered dragons and wind-puffing gods; the modernist painter Jasper Johns playfully reimagined the standard road-atlas depiction of the continental United States in his 1961 work “Map.” Maps can solidify national identity, expose societal problems, illuminate trends and whip up jingoistic emotions in wartime. “The map as a concept is complex and ever changing,” the Library of Congress cartography expert John Hessler writes in his introduction to “Map: Exploring the World.” But “it is the cartographic image’s intricate and abstract visual element that is the locus of its strength and lasting appeal.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/map-exploring-the-world-the-curious-map-book-and-more.html

And no matter what we think of it today, it has been forever since Hollywood was all it’s cracked up to be. As Marlene ­Dietrich once wrote, “When I came to Hollywood, the great era of silent films was over and done with. The village was not ‘gay and reckless’ anymore.

He was a culture vulture and party-giver who liked to be in on the latest thing, and maybe his friendships with African-­American artists and intellectuals represented nothing more than a kind of cultural tourism. Certainly W.E.B. Du Bois mistrusted him, and Ralph Ellison “despised his photography,” and he alienated many with his sensational 1926 roman à clef, “Nigger Heaven.” But he got Langston Hughes published, and furthered the careers of others; Walter White, head of the N.A.A.C.P., named his son Carl.

Jerry Brown. Residents reduced their water used in October by 22.2 percent compared with 2013, the state’s lowest conservation rate since mandatory water reductions began in the summer. Over all, residents remain on a pace to meet the 25 percent goal, having saved 27.1 percent over 2013 in the five months from June to October. State water officials have said saving water will be more difficult during the winter because Californians used less water during the winter in years past. They said they expected conservation rates to remain lower during the colder months. “I was relieved at the numbers,” Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said of October’s 22 percent figure. The emergency drought regulations will be in effect through February, but officials are considering a new set of emergency regulations if the drought continues.

As Dale Talde writes in ASIAN-AMERICAN: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes From the Philippines to Brooklyn (Grand Central Life & Style, $32), we “used to want food to be a pat on the back, not an uppercut to the chin.” Today, the best recipes communicate a rebellious spirit and a back story amounting to more than a fill-in-the-blank: “I went to X and fell in love with Y.” Whether it’s Thailand and green papaya salad, Israel and lemon-mint couscous, or France and sole meunière (if you’re Julia Child), these stories have grown tiresome if not precious. I gravitate toward lawless recipes that fall under the admittedly loose rubric of what Talde calls an “immigrant’s cuisine.” This is food undergirded by a strong tradition of regional home cooking overlain by the potent influence of “diners, gyro shops, Polish delis, taquerias, burger joints, Chinese spots and other food meccas.” This food is defined as much by “meat loaf and hot dogs” as it is by “shawarma and roti, tacos and yakitori.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/cooking-asian-american-women-chefs-of-new-york-and-more.html

In “The Jemima Code,” her inspiring account of the stories of our unsung and unrewarded history, Toni Tipton-Martin has made such a claim and has served up a slice of history with bold flavors, cultural enlightenment and real-life images of the people of color whose culinary contributions are realized in these pages. Gifted pioneers, they were creating recipes, managing plantations and running commercial kitchens in a world that regarded them as less than full partners, and often invisible ones.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/the-jemima-code-by-toni-tipton-martin.html

2015-12-02,The War Within Tonya Pinkins,"As the artistic director of Classic Stage Company since 2003, Brian Kulick, who steps down at the end of this season, making way for John Doyle, has had a knack for persuading great actors to challenge themselves in classic roles (like Peter Sarsgaard in “Hamlet” and F. Murray Abraham in “Gallileo”). So it’s fitting that one of his last productions at the intimate gem of a theater pairs Tonya Pinkins with one of the mightiest roles in the canon, the title character in Brecht’s “Mother Courage and Her Children.” In playing the canny survivor ground down by a war-torn world, Ms. Pinkins will be following the likes of Fiona Shaw and Meryl Streep. Ms. Pinkins often seems to elevate her material, but when she sinks into a complex role worthy of her gifts — “Caroline, or Change” is perhaps the best example — the results can be thrilling. That’s what makes this show such a downtown event. Duncan Sheik, the composer behind “Spring Awakening,” wrote new music. Mr. Kulick directs.

2015-12-02,Dev Hynes as Blood Orange: A Force of Motion,"Blood Orange is the recording and performing name for Dev Hynes, who grew up in London and became an excellent New Yorker about 10 years ago. He’s become semi-popular for his songs — the curious and elegiac tracks on the albums “Coastal Grooves” and “Cupid Deluxe” — but beyond the recorded evidence, Blood Orange represents a force of motion, aggregation, reclamation and scholarship. In his own work and through his collaborations with female singers — Carly Rae Jepsen, Solange Knowles, FKA twigs, Sky Ferreira — he’s been creatively juxtaposing the sounds of ’80s and ’90s R&B and dance music against changing contemporary aesthetics. He has never fully committed to becoming a touring act, but it’s not a stretch to predict that “Blood Orange and Friends,” at the Apollo on Dec. 12, will be a memorable scene. Guests include the rappers Le1f and Junglepussy; the hip-hop trio Ratking; and a D.J. set by Kindness, a.k.a. the singer Adam Bainbridge.

Although Mr. Keigwin loves ensembles, his new “3 Ballads” is a solo — his first in more than a decade. But he’s still filling the stage with energetic steps.

2015-12-02,Intimate Pictures From a Legendary Photographer,"“Hardly anyone keeps albums anymore,’’ says the photographer Peter Schlesinger as we flip through stacks of embossed picture diaries in his New York loft. ‘‘But I guess no one really did then either.’’ The perfectly preserved, chronologically organized volumes begin soon after 1966, the year the California-born Schlesinger, then 18, met the British painter David Hockney, who was teaching a summer course at U.C.L.A. This was the beginning of a love affair that would take Schlesinger to London, straight into the eye of a twister of bohemian glamour and creativity. While studying painting at the Slade School of Fine Art, he began to capture the most magnetic personalities in the couple’s social circle with his Pentax camera. There was the fashion designer Ossie Clark and his partner Celia Birtwell, the model Amanda Lear, Manolo Blahnik, Paloma Picasso, Cecil Beaton and the man who would eventually become Schlesinger’s lifelong partner, the Swedish-born photographer Eric Boman. With a natural, snapshot-like aesthetic, Schlesinger managed to conjure happy, blink-and-they’re-gone moments in time. There were weekend trips to Beaton’s country house, wine-drenched lunches by the pool at Tony Richardson’s in the South of France and late-night dancing at everyone’s favorite underground club in London, Yours or Mine. These effervescent images became the basis of his first book: ‘‘Checkered Past,’’ published in 2003. Schlesinger recently released a second volume, ‘‘Peter Schlesinger: A Photographic Memory 1968-1989’’ ($50, Damiani), which includes some of his greatest (and formerly unseen) hits from the London years plus images from his life after he and Boman moved to Manhattan 37 years ago. Schlesinger, now a ceramic artist, has lived and worked with Boman in the same former girdle factory in the Flatiron district for these past decades. Four months a year they decamp to their house in Bellport, N.Y., where Boman bakes and Schlesinger tends the garden. ‘‘These days I take more pictures of my plants than anything else,’’ he says. ‘‘But they’re my friends, too.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/t-magazine/peter-schlesinger-photography-book.html

2015-12-03,Adrian Tomine’s ‘Killing and Dying’,"“Graphic novel” is a perfectly serviceable phrase, but it expresses an unmistakable and unfortunate bias, emphasizing the literary identity of a given book at the expense of its visual essence. Pictures are more than prose carried out by other means. And there is some category confusion when it comes to a book like Adrian Tomine’s “Killing and Dying.”  “Graphic short story” doesn’t sound quite right, but how else to describe the half-dozen vignettes in this collection, each one bristling with acute observations and piquant ironies? These tales — pocket epics of romantic, creative and social frustration set in recognizably drab, drably picturesque American landscapes — certainly invite comparison to the work of words-only short-form masters like Raymond ­Carver, Ann Beattie and Mary Gaitskill, and for that matter O. Henry himself. You can almost forget you’re looking at drawings.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/adrian-tomines-killing-and-dying.html

He finds deep cultural resonance in August Wilson’s “Seven Guitars,” about blues musicians in the 1940s, because “it teaches through joy, not through reason.” The Broadway director Susan Stroman (“The Producers”), whose personal sorrows include the death of her husband, says, “Tapping into joy — it saves you.” And writing about the film and stage work of Ingmar Bergman, whom he visited at home on the island of Faro, Lahr finds “another kind of joy” in “the audacity of Bergman’s camera, in the vigor of his argument.” The word morphs as it meets its subjects.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/joy-ride-by-john-lahr.html

In 1955, a photographer for Magnum, Dennis Stock, shadowed and snapped an ascendant James Dean for Life magazine, a few months before Dean died in a car accident. Mr. Corbijn picturesquely frames the back story to the shoot, but his muffled retelling drifts with Dane DeHaan’s murmurous impersonation of Dean and Robert Pattinson’s almost perversely listless turn as Stock.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/movies/review-in-life-photographing-james-dean-the-rising-star.html

Hugh Fraser and, later, wife of the playwright Harold Pinter — made the startling discovery that she was “not really a girl.” That is, having just spent four years learning Greek and Latin at a school for boys (mostly) called the Dragon, next door to her family’s home in Oxford, England, she excelled at ancient languages and at the knock-’em-sock-’em sport of rugby, but was completely unschooled in conventional girlish behavior.

2015-12-04,Bee Wilson’s ‘First Bite: How We Learn to Eat’,"For a long time, the British food journalist Bee Wilson automatically craved something indulgent before boarding a train. In “First Bite: How We Learn to Eat,” she traces this instinct to a ritual she had with her father when she was a teenager. Her parents had just split up, and whenever her dad would send Wilson on a train back to her mother’s house, he’d buy her a magazine and a box of chocolate-coated malted milk balls, something that, before her parents’ divorce, would have been deemed a special-occasion treat. She felt powerless to refuse the candy, even as she was struggling with a disconcerting weight gain. It took Wilson years to realize that her father’s gesture was as much about making him feel like “the generous provider” as it was to reward her with a happy sugar high. She writes: “To give a child the things she loves to eat bestows a heroic glow. It feels almost as wonderful as eating.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/bee-wilsons-first-bite-how-we-learn-to-eat.html

Jellybean Benitez, watching from the booth while the crowd moves. It’s poignant how dazed New Order looks in this video — a couple of years earlier, they were your basic mopey indie twits, and here they are making the scene as their music plays at the world’s hippest dance club. Yet the most poignant sight is that of the singer Bernard Sumner, who spends the first half of the clip wearing deck shorts and white tube socks.

But she is also a regular person. Her new memoir, “M Train,” can be seen as a plea to acknowledge her as one. Like the rest of us ordinary folk, she endures the frustrations and banalities of everyday life — keeping despair at bay with TV crime shows, cats and caffeine. She identifies unapologetically with the detectives on “The Killing” and “CSI: Miami.” I “adopt their ways,” she explains, “suffer their failures and consider their movements long after an episode ends, whether in real time or rerun.” Her cats are not cuddly and decorative but authentic. One wakes her in the morning by throwing up on the edge of her pillow. Her drug of choice is black coffee. Much of “M Train” takes place in different cafes, and the reader can map the effect of the substance on her imagination. With each sip her mind awakens and her ruminations deepen.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/patti-smiths-m-train.html

Start at the bottom of the skull, and cut a straight line to the base of the tail along the spine. ‘‘Always use a sharp blade,’’ says Eddy, who prefers a carbon steel scalpel. Peel the skin back as you would an orange. Trim carefully around the paws, mouth, nose and eyes. This is obviously not work for the squeamish, but to make a lifelike remembrance of an animal means doing things that make its death inescapable.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/magazine/how-to-skin-a-cat.html

In Denis Villeneuve’s drug war opus, “Sicario,” it is hard to fathom any other actor as Alejandro, a tormented Mexican ex-prosecutor turned avenger who alternately menaces and protects the F.B.I. agent played by Emily Blunt.

Many of the streets were decked with tricolor flags, and the balconies and windows were decorated with black hangings. Wooden stands for sightseers were erected in all the streets, in the shop fronts and even on the decks of the barges on the canals, and places were paid for at extraordinary prices. An Englishman gave 300 florins for a window. The procession formed, one mile long, and taking seventy-five minutes to pass a given point, the principal features were the muffled drums, the military bands playing Chopin’s and Handel’s funeral dirges. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 5, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/1890-king-william-laid-in-his-grave/

If inflation had responded to the Great Recession and aftermath the way it did in previous big slumps, we would be deep in deflation by now; we aren’t.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/anchors-away-slightly-wonkish/

2015-12-04,‘Portraits: John Berger on Artists’,"Has John Berger mellowed? Apparently not. In his new book, the passionately wayward and contentious English writer, who once shared his Booker Prize money with the Black Panther Party, recalls being ejected from the National Gallery in London. “You have insulted one of my men,” the security chief tells Berger. “You have shouted obscene words in a public institution. You will now walk in front of us to the main exit.” Berger’s crime? He refused, after a quarrel with a guard, to put his bag on his shoulder while drawing from a favorite painting, Antonello da Messina’s “Crucifixion.” Now almost 90, Berger still has the deep devotion to pictures, not to mention the reflexive anti-­authoritarianism, that you might associate with a first-year art ­student.

2015-12-04,1940: War Prisoners to Be Sent Food,"WASHINGTON — The American Red Cross announced today [Dec. 4] that war prisoners in European camps will receive 5,000 packages of food before the end of the year as a result of an urgent request of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. The shipment will be the first of what is to be known as a ‘‘prisoners-of-war package service,’’ the Red Cross said. The Red Cross announced that food would be sent first because of the great need, but that later shipments would include clothing also. The food now is being purchased and will be packed by a merchandising firm for the Red Cross. The parcels will weigh eleven pounds each, will cost approximately $2.75 and will contain evaporated milk, oatmeal, cheese, sardines, oleo margarine, dried fruit, corned beef, orange juice, sugar, cigarettes and vitamized dry beverages requiring only the addition of water. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 5, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/1940-war-prisoners-to-be-sent-food/

Patterson was at the National Book Awards ceremony last month, at Cipriani Wall Street, to accept the Literarian Award for his efforts to promote reading. “I feel uncomfortable,” he told the crowd, “because, well, I am the elephant in the room, the bull in the china shop, the stranger in a strange land, the Big Mac at Cipriani.” He went on to discuss his early love of fiction — he’s partial to the terrific novels “Mr. Bridge” and “Mrs. Bridge,” by Evan S. Connell — and to praise school libraries and independent bookstores, encouraging his listeners to help those institutions if they could: “Let’s all be literarians, whatever the hell that means.” He also revealed that his debut mystery, “The Thomas Berryman Number,” had been rejected 31 times before finding a home. “I keep a list of all the editors who turned down my first novel,” he said. “Sometimes they send me books and ask for blurbs.

2015-12-04,Resistance Is Futile,"There’s no data on this, but I’d guess that most self-help books are purchased in the depths of a bad mood. When we’re happy, we idle and play. When we’re not, we buy books that promise a fix. And when those books fail to deliver, we feel wronged. The market has responded accordingly, with a crop of new books seemingly aimed at people who have grown cynical about self-help. These books have profane titles, saucy premises and, in one case, a cover photo of the author posing nearly nude and oiled and aiming a weapon. Their tone is belligerent. Much like their intended readers, these books could be credibly described as having an attitude problem.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/resistance-is-futile.html

Mr. Hodari is a founding partner of Industrious, which has been constructing its first outpost in New York. “It’s a little ironic,” he said in late October, “because my work is devoted to saying that working at home inhibits your creativity and makes it harder to be productive.

You know how it works: A restaurant moves into an underserved area, attracts attention, then a crowd, and then other restaurants and larger crowds. Before you know it, the original restaurant can no longer afford to remain in the very neighborhood it helped create. That’s exactly what happened to Union Square Cafe, Danny Meyer’s flagship bistro. After 30 years, the restaurant is relocating from its perch on East 16th Street to the other side of Union Square.

2015-12-04,"In Miami, a Trio of Minimalist Paintings","It’s undeniable that figuration stands tall in today’s art market — bodies of all shapes and sizes are in evidence throughout the Miami art fairs and are the subject of one of the most buzzed-about pop-up exhibitions in town, “Unrealism,” at the Design District’s Moore Building, curated by the heavyweight double bill of Jeffrey Deitch and Larry Gagosian. However, as soon as a trend hits a saturation point, the window opens wide for a counterpoint. Throughout Art Basel Miami Beach, there are a number of strikingly spare paintings whose minimal, monochromatic brushstrokes bear uncanny superficial resemblances, despite originating from very different times and places. The 78-year-old Swiss painter Niele Toroni is known for applying short, squarish acrylic streaks of a prescribed size in strict patterns; he has new works on offer at a number of booths, including Alfonso Artiaco. On offer at Greene Naftali is a historical work by the recently deceased German painter Gunther Forg — who, though prolific like Toroni, is known for constant variation rather than repetition. Finally, the Paris-based South Korean artist Lee Ufan’s canvas of two blocky gray smears at Galerie Nächst St. Stephan Rosemarie Schwarzwälder is discreetly rooted in the natural origin of its materials, which combine oil with pigments of stone.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/t-magazine/art/art-basel-miami-monochromatic-paintings.html

The bomb exploded outside the Kantajew temple in the Dinajpur District, where about 1,500 people had gathered to watch an open-air folk performance as part of a fair in the area, said Iltutmish, a police official in the district. The motive for the attack and the identity of the attackers were not clear on Saturday. The fair, which has been held in the district for years, includes secular cultural events and often has many non-Hindu attendees, Mr. Iltutmish said. The Hindu population in Bangladesh has been dwindling for decades, down to about 8 percent of the total population of the largely Muslim country in 2011. The government has denied that the Islamic State is carrying out attacks in the country, instead identifying suspects associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party associated with the political opposition. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack. Mohammad Ruhul Amin, the police superintendent in Dinajpur, said that at least four people had been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, but that no arrests had been made.

Its organization, however, is slow, and its intervention cannot be regarded as imminent. Guns of 305mm. and 210mm., sent from Germany, are reported to have arrived in the Gallipoli Peninsula, where the Turks are preparing for an offensive soon. It is asserted among German officers in Constantinople that the expedition against Egypt will set out about the beginning of next month.

Theoretically the notion of a supreme deity was officially recognized by the charter of the French educational system as laid down by Jules Ferry, founder of the modern French public-school system, but in practice it had been ignored by the great majority of French school teachers for years. But now, by a law just promulgated, Georges Ripert, Minister of Education, has decreed that ‘‘programs of morality must henceforth be taught in the elementary and secondary schools’’ beginning Jan. 1, 1941. In the elementary schools one hour a week must be devoted to the following subject: ‘‘The principal duties of the pupils toward their neighbors (family and country) and toward God.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 7, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/1940-vichy-schools-again-to-teach-concept-of-god/

Modiano has encouraged such conflation, for one thing, in interviews and essays and the like. But this on its own would be insufficient justification.

Robinson defines the “given” as something “that presents itself, reveals itself, always partially and circumstantially, accessible to only tentative apprehension, which means that it is always newly meaningful.” Calvin insisted that divine wisdom was one such “given,” perceived only “within radical limits.” Robinson does not say so, but here Calvin was deeply in tune with the great sages of the past, who all maintained that the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao must always ultimately elude us.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/marilynne-robinsons-the-givenness-of-things.html

Mr. Sayyari’s remarks, reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, did not explain the precise origin of the outbreak or how the Iranian authorities intended to combat it. Swine flu is named for a virus that infects pigs, but the H1N1 strain, which first emerged in 2009, spreads via human-to-human contact and escalated into a global pandemic before it was contained after a year. The virus is now considered a human seasonal flu virus, according to the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States, and can be prevented with a vaccine.

Foremost is Irina Bazili, the young Moldovan immigrant whose repressed “terrors” of adolescence form a drumbeat of foreshadowing through the three years of her service to Alma. But as the story lurches back to the late 1930s and then to the highlights between, we also meet Alma’s Jewish family in pre-World War II Europe; the San Francisco relatives who adopt her; the entire family of her Japanese lover, Ichimei Fukuda; and a host of other lovers, care givers, evildoers and saints.

2015-12-09,Serious Play,"Stephen Shore was 24 in 1972 when he took his first photographic road trip across the United States. Using color film and a 35-millimeter Rollei, he shot a bewildering variety of subjects: roads, homes, gas stations, fluorescent bulbs, pay phones, hotel beds, cars and televisions. He took pictures of friends and strangers, meals and toilets, framed paintings on walls, fridges left open, shop fronts after hours: anything, it seemed, at which the camera could be pointed. The body of work he made over the next two years, eventually exhibited and published as ‘‘American Surfaces,’’ feels oddly familiar now. With its flatness and indiscriminate subject matter, it looks just like the stuff people put on Instagram. But for all their casual affect, Shore’s images are sophisticated, supported by an instinct for pictorial structure. Along with William Eggleston, he was a pioneer of an American visual demotic, long before anyone could have dreamed of social media.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/magazine/serious-play.html

2015-12-10,Art as Social Critique — With a Little Help From the Rolling Stones and Katy Perry,"When you walk into “No Kidding,” the artist Deborah Kass’s exhibition opening tonight at Paul Kasmin Gallery, be prepared for a strange sensation: you can almost hear Kass’s new mixed-media paintings in addition to seeing them. “The thing about music is that it’s so democratic, and art isn’t,” Kass said when T visited her studio last month. Throughout the show, the artist alludes to popular song lyrics from a wide swath of eras, from the 1895 waltz “The Band Played On” to Fats Waller’s 1929 “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” to Katy Perry’s 2010 “Teenage Dream.” The references are diverse, but taken as a whole, their message is clear: a deep-seated, and deeply droll, cynicism about the present political and artistic climate, and about our capacity to fiddle while Rome burns. Other pieces in the show ironically deploy phrases like “GOOD TIMES” and, in several three-panel works, “WHO BLUE WHO,” to much the same effect.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/t-magazine/art/deborah-kass-no-kidding-paul-kasmin.html

2015-12-10,Report Traces Ebola’s Spread in Liberia," Ebola viruses that sickened many people during the height of the epidemic in Liberia can be traced back to a single case of the disease probably introduced from Sierra Leone, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Cell Host and Microbe. “The data are consistent with the vast majority of cases in Liberia coming from a single event,” said Jason T. Ladner of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. The virus then spread from Liberia back into Guinea, where the current epidemic was first identified. Scientists analyzed genomic sequences from 140 blood samples, nearly 2 percent of all reported cases in Liberia, collected over 11 months, after a smaller outbreak had been controlled. Liberia had no new Ebola cases last week, and a recent cluster was most likely linked to a rare case of transmission from a survivor, officials said Wednesday.

We all know that the sweep of a careless elbow can shatter it into unmendable bits. But take some basic precautions and in a hundred years it will look as good as new — its colors undimmed, its whites snowy — after you and your children are dead and gone. It is fragile, and it is strong.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/the-white-road-by-edmund-de-waal.html

2015-12-10,"Delicate, Magical Portraits of Plants’ Inner Lives","Do plants have souls? With her “Honesty Pictures” series, the artist Alice Cazenave aims to find out, by capturing the delicate inner workings of leaves and stems. Inspired by her background in molecular science as well as her family history of craftspeople (her relatives have included cabinetmakers and draftswomen), Cazenave employs experimental, camera-free techniques to get at the essence of plants. She strips the leaves of pigment by washing them in chemical solutions that transform them into translucent, glassy structures, then uses them directly as negatives, placing them onto photosensitive paper and then exposing them to light. She doesn’t use lenses or screens, in an effort to create images as a “direct consequence of an interaction between light and object,” she says. This series is intended to capture a sense of “shadows peeled off the real” — and to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to a medium that has become almost universally accessible. “Much of my work comments on the growing disengagement with the natural world, and aims to re-establish a sense of magic and alchemy to photography, which I feel in recent times has been lost.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/t-magazine/art/plant-photography-alice-cazenave.html

He is probably best remembered in the United States for his Dadaist “Homage to New York,” a self-destructing junk sculpture cobbled together from scrap metal and mechanical elements that he activated in the Museum of Modern Art’s sculpture garden in March 1960. Since its demise was halted by the fire department, a surviving fragment is in the museum’s collection.

2015-12-11,Antibiotic Sales for Food Rise,"Despite a major effort by the Obama administration to reduce the use of antibiotics, the amount of those drugs sold for use in animals grown for food rose again last year. Sales to farmers and ranchers rose by 3 percent from 2013, the Food and Drug Administration said, and sales are up by 23 percent since 2009, when the agency began reporting the figures. Indiscriminate antibiotic use, in people and animals, is leading to the rise of superbugs resistant to many critical drugs. Critics say the use of antibiotics to prevent sickness in animals is too sweeping. Lance Price, a researcher at the Milken Institute School of Public Health, noted that cephalosporins, a class of drug often used to treat ear and urinary tract infections, rose 12 percent last year, which he said doctors would find troubling.

2015-12-11,1915: A Funereal Error,"BERLIN — A widow lady named Wachterhausen, residing at Potsdam, recently had the misfortune to lose her only daughter, Amalia, who was staying at Nice for the benefit of her health. The mother telegraphed to an undertaker in that town ordering an elaborate coffin, and requesting that the remains should be sent home for burial. Just before the funeral on Sunday the mother had the coffin opened, and found that it contained, not her child, but the body of an old officer in Russian uniform. On making inquiries she learned by telegram from Nice that the bodies had been accidentally exchanged. Her daughter’s body had been forwarded to Smolensk in Russia instead of that of the officer. On telegraphing to the Russian authorities Madame Wachterhausen was informed that the body of her daughter had just been buried with great ceremony and military honors. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 12, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/1915-a-funereal-error/

Briggle had never even heard of fracking when he was hired as a professor of philosophy at the University of North Texas, in 2009. But with around 250 gas wells drilled within Denton’s city limits, the subject was thrust upon his consciousness. A member of the City Council asked him to form a citizens’ advisory group for gas-well regulations, and Briggle became a field philosopher, running across highways, helping collect air samples from backyards, consulting not only Mary Shelley and the theologian Duns Scotus to help guide him along “the arduous trail that is thinking” but also scientists, engineers, mayors, neighbors and his daughter, Lulu, a 2-year-old rogue impervious to propaganda.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/a-field-philosophers-guide-to-fracking-by-adam-briggle.html

2015-12-11,Inside the List,"Let It Go: Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to South African apartheid, turns up on the monthly relationships list on Page 24 this week: “The Book of Forgiving,” written with his daughter Mpho Tutu, is at No. 9. “It doesn’t matter whether you are having trouble moving forward from the wrongs that were done to you, or whether you need the courage to admit the wrongs you have done,” he writes in the introduction. “Forgiveness is nothing less than the way we heal the world. We heal the world by healing each and every one of our hearts.” If that kind of talk triggers flashbacks to your last cardiologist visit — the best way to heal our hearts is probably to eat less bacon — it remains true that Tutu writes with undeniable moral force. And given his experiences leading the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid’s fall, his prescription is not just simple but consistent and radical. “In South Africa, we chose to seek forgiveness rather than revenge,” he writes. “That choice averted a blood bath. For every injustice, there is a choice. . . . You can choose forgiveness or revenge, but revenge is always costly. Choosing forgiveness rather than retaliation ultimately serves to make you a stronger and freer person.” As it happens, your cardiologist might agree. According to the Johns Hopkins Medicine website, “Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can reap huge rewards for your health, lowering the risk of heart attack; improving cholesterol levels and sleep; and reducing pain, blood pressure and levels of anxiety, depression and stress.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-12-11,William H. Gass’s ‘Eyes’ and John Barth’s ‘Collected Stories’,"Every so often a magazine with curatorial or prophetic aspirations — say, Granta or The New Yorker — produces a list of the best writers under 40 from a particular nation state. The underlying principle isn’t much more than the logic of the marketplace — the search for the new commodity, explicitly applied to literature. But these lists are haunted by a cluster of unspoken questions about writing’s relationship to longevity. Are writers so short of material that they need to be anointed before midlife? Is novelistic craft not perfected over time? If the answers to these questions aren’t obvious, why not imagine a shadow list that gathers the best American fiction by writers over 80? William H. Gass — 91 years old at the time of writing — would certainly benefit from such a list, since his work typically gestates across decades. He labored on his central achievement, “The Tunnel” (1995), for longer than some acclaimed young novelists have been alive, while his latest volume, “Eyes,” has similarly been in the pipeline at least since the turn of the millennium.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/william-h-gasss-eyes-and-john-barths-collected-stories.html

Although my friend would soon become a distinguished science writer, one of the pleasures of our friendship was scaring each other silly. We kept joking about those bears. Halfway up Mount Rogers, we got caught in a thunderstorm and took shelter under a rock face that leaned into canopy. It was a fine hide-out, but it was not ours alone. Under our feet we saw the scat of a large animal, copious and dark — and fresh.

Literary purists scoffed at its purple prose; Indian (and many other) readers bristled at its stereotypes and cultural simplifications. The book nonetheless possessed a grittiness and vividness that helped Roberts sell four million copies around the world. Hollywood rights were scooped up (though a film has yet to be made). The book has gone on to occupy a distinctive — and deserving — place in an emerging genre of Bombay noir.,Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/the-mountain-shadow-by-gregory-david-roberts.html

One night when I was on call, I worked with someone in the second camp. He told me about a patient of his, an elderly woman with pancreatic cancer that had grown into her bile duct and metastasized through her intestinal tract. She had been through several rounds of ­chemotherapy without success and was ready to quit treatment, but was afraid to tell her oncologist. “She told me, ‘I don’t want him to think I’m giving up,’ ” my colleague said, obviously disgusted that she didn’t feel comfortable speaking freely about her goals.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/books/review/the-death-of-cancer-by-vincent-t-devita-jr-and-elizabeth-devita-raeburn.html

There were dozens of species of ceratopsians, but Triceratops, which lived in North America about 65 million years ago, is the best known. “These small dinosaurs were related to Triceratops, but very distantly,” said Catherine A.

2015-12-14,Ohio: Objection to Disposal Practices at Planned Parenthood Clinics,"An investigation into whether three Planned Parenthood clinics had improperly sold fetal tissue found that they had not, but said that they disposed of aborted fetuses improperly by turning them over to disposal companies that take the remains to landfills, the state attorney general, Mike DeWine, said Friday. Mr. DeWine said that sending aborted fetuses to a landfill was “callous and completely inhumane” and violated a state administrative code requirement that fetuses be disposed of “in a humane manner.” He referred his findings to the Ohio Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinics. Stephanie Kight, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, issued a statement calling the accusations “inflammatory and baseless.” She said Planned Parenthood “handles medical tissue like any other quality health care provider. Our agreements with vendors all require them to follow state law, and dispose of tissue accordingly. If they are not, then I will take swift action.” Ms. Kight said she was concerned that the attorney general’s report was “not the result of meaningful investigation, but instead yet another attack on women’s access to health care in the state of Ohio.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/us/ohio-objection-to-disposal-practices-at-planned-parenthood-clinics.html

Mr. Abdulkadir, who federal agents said has contacted terrorism suspects on Twitter, is accused of impeding and retaliating against a federal law enforcement officer. The Minneapolis area, which has a large Somali population, has been a center of jihadist recruiting in America for years, with several young men from there leaving the country to join terrorist organizations abroad.

Her hourlong work “Horizon” had its premiere last week at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University as part of the Peak Performances series here, and its mix of purity and athleticism is strong, clean, bold and exciting. It fluently combines modern technique with a postmodern and quasi-analytical scrutiny of pedestrians and athletes.

2015-12-14,Review: ‘Blood Orange and Friends’ at the Apollo," Blood Orange, Dev Hynes’s solo project, is a continuing force of homage. A Blood Orange song, in how Mr. Hynes sings and plays and dances it, may remind you of stylish and romantic energies in pop and R&B from around the time he was born, the mid-1980s: records like Janet Jackson’s “Control” or Cyndi Lauper’s “True Colors.” But he isn’t paying homage purely in the service of look or sound or era. Pop savants raiding old styles for shallow reasons can sound hard-shell or narcissistic. Mr. Hynes’s songs point directly toward their influences, yet remain strangely light in ego, gentle and opaque and elegiac to the bone.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/arts/music/review-blood-orange-and-friends-at-the-apollo.html

I thought it might be useful to walk through how I understand the situation, illustrating the argument with data from Spain, which I think of as the quintessential euro-crisis country — a country that didn’t commit any obvious policy sins, but was whipsawed by huge inflows of capital that suddenly reversed.

Each new insurrection feels spontaneous even as it revives antique crusades to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, “get rid” of the Supreme Court or — most persistent of all — rejuvenate the Old South.

There were 16 students, all in their early 40s and most of them lieutenant colonels, who had been selected to spend a year in this rural, peaceful place learning how to think strategically about war. In modern business, ‘‘thinking strategically’’ has become a cliché entirely devoid of meaning. But in the military, its meaning remains quite precise. As one person in the class told me, as a lieutenant colonel in a tank battalion, he was engaged in tactics: making sure that his tankers and their tanks were ready to fight.

The film, which opens on Christmas, traces Joy’s decades-long journey, from a precocious girl in the 1960s to a disgruntled housewife in the 1970s to a steely entrepreneur in the 1990s, surmounting financial woes, con artists and her meddlesome Greek chorus of a family.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/movies/theres-joy-in-working-together-again.html

Chain-link and razor wire, it slices through pastures as it traces Hungary’s southern border. More than 100 miles long, it was constructed quickly this summer as refugees streamed into the country, heading toward Austria and Germany. Police officers and soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards, and they examined my passport at almost every checkpoint. They seemed bored, perhaps because the flood of refugees and migrants had mostly abated. The fence had sealed Hungary off, and that made Laszlo Toroczkai — the 37-year-old mayor of Asotthalom, a Hungarian farming town on the Serbian border, and a rising ultranationalist star of far-right European politics — very happy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/magazine/has-europe-reached-the-breaking-point.html

This year’s annual performances of Handel’s “Messiah” went by, alas, without him. He would have led Benjamin Britten’s “A Ceremony of Carols” and John Rutter’s “Dancing Day” in a concert on Thursday, Dec. 17. (Stephen Buzard, the choir’s acting music director, will conduct instead.) And now comes an album of the Britten and Rutter works and a few other carols, the last of Mr. Scott’s many recordings, bringing tidings of melancholy and joy. The choir sings wonderfully, whether accompanied by Mr. Buzard or Benjamin Sheen on organ, or Sara Cutler on harp. Several of the boy trebles — some of whom by now, as such things go, may well be baritones — have lovely solo moments. Yet another worthy memorial to a beloved figure on the New York music scene.

We are in a Nazi death camp, and really in it, to a degree that few fictional films have had the nerve to attempt. The camera doesn’t just survey the barracks and the guard towers, the haggard prisoners and brutal guards. It takes us to the very door of the gas chambers, in the close company of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig), a Jewish inmate who is a member of the camp’s Sonderkommando (special commando) unit.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/movies/review-son-of-saul-revisits-life-and-death-in-auschwitz.html

2015-12-18,United Nations: Sanctions Against ISIS Adopted," The United Nations Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a legally binding resolution aimed at preventing banned terrorist groups from making money and using the international banking system, with an emphasis on the Islamic State group. The resolution builds on previous Council measures, also legally binding, that make it illegal to donate money to terrorist groups, trade in oil and antiquities or make ransom payments. Those prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and the new resolution, drafted by Russia and the United States, is intended to strengthen it. The resolution calls on countries to describe what steps they are taking to prevent terrorist organizations from making money, including interdicting oil sales. The effects may be limited: The Islamic State group draws a large share of its revenues from “taxes” imposed on the people who live in its territories. Perhaps the most incongruous element of the resolution is that one of its sponsors is the government of Syria.

For 90 minutes, dozens of people — mostly young men in blue-and-orange Knicks gear — approached him and shyly introduced themselves with the same excited greeting: “Yo, K.P.!” Many of them asked Porzingis, who is 7-foot-3, if he would mind standing up before they took their photographs and selfies. What one learns in such a situation is that there are not many ways to tell a man he is tall.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/nyregion/the-knicks-needed-a-hero-enter-kristaps-porzingis.html

2015-12-18,Inside the List,"Indefinable: Poetry doesn’t hit the lists very often, but when it does, it can hit big. In 2015, Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen” stayed on the monthly race and civil rights list all year; it’s currently No. 5. A hard-to-classify volume of prose poems, or lyrical essays, about daily encounters with racism — “I wanted to replicate the sense of having these stories come at you,” Rankine told The New Statesman — the book has also spent time on the paperback nonfiction list and, more counterintuitively, the monthly relationships list. (One place it hasn’t appeared yet is the monthly politics list, although that may change now that a young woman in Illinois was spotted reading it at a Trump rally.) The people who compile the Times lists aren’t the only ones who have struggled to define Rankine’s book. Last winter, “Citizen” became the first title ever nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in two categories: A finalist in criticism, it won in poetry. So what is this book, exactly? And how does Rankine feel about efforts to pin it down? “If we leave the structural hybridity of ‘Citizen’ aside,” she told me via email, “I want to believe there is a recognized veracity of experience for the people categorizing the book. Each feels ‘Citizen’ satisfies some truth or intention for their category. I am a poet, and I didn’t fictionalize the accounts told to me or taken from my life or from the news; I simply submerged my thinking into the ‘ethical loneliness’ (a phrase taken from the title of Jill Stauffer’s excellent book) that the sentences accumulated. The lyrical reflection of lives struggling to negotiate racism in our culture apparently feels authentic to many categories. That seems right.” Then she quoted a line from “Sentences and Paragraphs,” by Gertrude Stein: “Never ask any one what a sentence is or what it has been.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Abeles suggests that pursuit of this narrow form of success is actually harming children and families, and distorting our educational institutions. Her book is bound to be controversial, particularly to the education establishment — university presidents, the testing industry and the policy makers who support them. For many of them, “Beyond Measure” is likely to be regarded as a threat, if not downright subversive.

Or is it just graceless me that smells it? But the alternative, in this case, is worse, and it is as precious and highfalutin as it sounds given that the author is not Thomas Aquinas or John Ruskin. It is a phrase that promotes its author as an arbiter of grace, a lofty perch indeed from which to view us mere clumsy mortals. And so, Sarah L. Kaufman, in her first book, sets the stakes perilously high, particularly since her subject is not exactly origami but grace, that fragile, exquisite, transient entity of unparalleled depth, breadth, complexity and profundity. She has taken on, perhaps to her credit, the Sisyphean task of persuading us to choose grace over ego and so revisits that epic battle where grace loses every time — though ego never wins. Such ambition! But why not? We are in can-do America, and the author, dance critic for The Washington Post for almost 20 years, has a Pulitzer Prize in her pocket.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/books/review/the-art-of-grace-by-sarah-l-kaufman.html

This month, a measure of tranquillity has arrived in the form of Espace Clé de Peau Beauté, the new counter — and treatment room — for Shiseido’s prestige brand. The counter, an exercise in luxe minimalism with a Mondrian-style navy-and-white geometric facade, hides the 80-square-foot treatment room, which is closely modeled after the line’s first treatment space in Tokyo’s Ginza district. (Creating the tucked-away haven for facial treatments required some architectural finagling: namely, removing an office and storage room on the beauty floor.) As in the Japanese space, clean lines dominate the room, with products, linens and robes stored away to keep the focus on the treatment chair — and the person in it. Guests can choose from a small menu of treatment options, including the brand’s signature eight-step Synactif intensive purifying & brightening facial ($100), which is designed to encourage lymphatic drainage and which makes use of Clé de Peau Beauté’s proprietary treatment machine.

He and his colleagues compared the genome sequences of 19 wolves, 25 village dogs descended from indigenous dogs, and 46 domesticated dogs belonging to 34 breeds. Village dogs were more genetically diverse than domesticated dogs, and wolves were the most diverse of all. Domesticated dogs had roughly 115 more deleterious genetic variants that altered proteins than wolves.

The vote was eventually won by the “No” camp, preserving Britain as a political entity, but it was clear the moral victory had been lost regardless. The “Yes” campaign made an exciting and convincing case for an independent Scotland, to which people could be proud to belong. The “No” campaign, by contrast, utterly failed to make anything like a case for Britain as a concept — only a case that it was safer financially to preserve it.

São Paulo’s governor, Geraldo Alckmin, told reporters that the firefighter, Ronaldo Pereira da Cruz, had died at a hospital. The museum is closed on Mondays, a fact that probably averted additional casualties. The museum, in a building in the historic city center that is more than 100 years old, is considered a trove of information on the history and evolution of the Portuguese language. Early signs suggest that the cultural loss may be minimized. “We probably have many things backed up,” Isa Ferraz, a curator at the museum, told the Brazilian television station Globo. Mr. Alckmin, who visited the scene on Monday, pledged his support, saying of the museum, “It will be rebuilt.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/world/americas/brazil-fire-destroys-sao-paulo-museum.html

2015-12-24,Inside the List,"In With the New: James Rollins’s latest Sigma Force thriller, “The Bone Labyrinth” — new at No. 9 on the combined fiction list — is crammed as usual with a gleefully preposterous mix of science and legend and wild-eyed conspiracy theory, stuffed in so willy-nilly you suspect Rollins had to sit on the book just to get it closed. The plot this time has something to do with genetically engineered superhumans and the Apollo 11 moon landing and the supposed remains of Adam and Eve, which gives you an idea why Rollins sells so many copies; he’s what you might end up with if you tossed Michael Crichton and Dan Brown into a particle accelerator together. Rollins has long been an unabashed book nerd — in high school, he wore a “Keep On Tolkien” T-shirt — but he didn’t try his hand at writing novels until he had worked for some years as a veterinarian. That career influenced his thinking in this book, he told The Fort Worth Star-­Telegram, especially about evolution and intelligence: “I wanted to explore one of the big anthropological mysteries: How come, even though the human brain has remained about the same size for the past 200,000 years, there was a sudden explosion of ingenuity and creativity about 50,000 years ago? Anthropologists call it the Great Leap Forward, and it has baffled them as to what exactly the trigger for it was. Why did human intelligence suddenly surge ahead? I also had a file on Neanderthals. I found it curious that, at roughly the same time, 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals and modern man started to interact and breed, passing Neanderthal DNA into our lineage. No one has addressed the possibility that maybe this was the trigger. I have a background as a veterinarian, so I’m familiar with the fact that if you cross a donkey and a horse to get a mule, the mule has been shown to be a more intelligent animal than the donkey or the horse. I started thinking, ‘What if this kind of crossbreeding is the source of the Great Leap Forward?’ That’s how my stories build. I ponder these different concepts, I blend the science and the history, and the stories begin to layer like an onion, one layer upon another upon another.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

In the opening poem, “Reverse Voyage,” Jackson tells us where that is: “I come / back to unlit alleys, avenues in sheaths of grit / and utility wires like veins stitched to power supplies / buzzing above a different kind of hum.” The utility wires run like veins through the speaker as well, and we realize this reverse voyage is not a return trip but a confirmation that no matter how far the speaker journeys — for success, for beauty, for his art, for his woman — he carries home in his blood.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/roll-deep-by-major-jackson.html

At a time when most art photographers produced what Walker Evans described as “misty October lanes, snow scenes, reflets dans l’eau, young girls with crystal balls,” Sander’s documentary approach came as a clarifying, astringent solution. Here were men and women, children and old folks, farmers and bohemians, bricklayers and engineers, all portrayed with startling lucidity. Evans, who would acknowledge Sander’s influence on his own work, hailed “Face of Our Time” as “a case of the camera looking in the right direction among people.” More recently, Sander has inspired such contemporary photographers as Joel Sternfeld and Alec Soth.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/emblems-of-the-passing-world-by-adam-kirsch.html

2015-12-24,James Tate’s ‘Dome of the Hidden Pavilion’,"James Tate, who died in July at age 71, was the rare American poet who managed to make poems that were at once fanciful and grave, mundane and transcendent: He believed “the challenge is always to find the ultimate / in the ordinary.” That quotation captures some of Tate’s American plain-spokenness but not the dark currents of beauty he is capable of, or the way the “ultimate” becomes a tonic, in his poems, for the chaos around us. His work is singular in American poetry for marrying goofball humor and childish jouissance to a lyricism that never seems cheap or self-serious — an unusual achievement. Now we have his 17th book of verse, “Dome of the Hidden Pavilion,” which, like many of his recent books, is composed of prose-poem-like narratives about surreal small-town encounters. Inside its hidden pavilion, we find invisible alligators, toy soldiers that turn out to be alive, traumatized war veterans, exploding cows, existential despair. This is the Tate mode: serious absurdism, absurd seriousness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/james-tates-dome-of-the-hidden-pavilion.html

Anne Boyer has not forgotten this. She has written a sad, beautiful, passionate book that registers the political economy of literature and of life itself. This sounds dry, abstract: It’s not. Boyer’s book moves as if the contents of a ­brokenhearted country song were mediated through the ferocious mind of a Hannah Arendt. Boyer offers a self-portrait of the artist in a time of “indentured moods,” debt collection, chemical spills, amid her attempts at and refusals of writing, sewing and the daily care of herself and her small daughter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/books/review/anne-boyers-garments-against-women.html

2015-12-25,Arab League Condemns Abduction of Qataris by Armed Group in Iraq," Arab League foreign ministers on Thursday condemned what they called the “shameful” abduction of at least 26 Qatari hunters one week ago in a remote part of southern Iraq near the Saudi Arabian border. The hunters, who included some senior members of Qatar’s royalty, were seized by unidentified gunmen, and there has been no word on their whereabouts or the demands — if any — made by the kidnappers. In a statement reported by Qatar’s official news agency, the Arab League foreign ministers, meeting in Cairo, expressed “full solidarity” with Qatar’s government in efforts to secure the release of the hunters, who had entered Iraq legally. Their uncertain fate has strained relations between Sunni-dominated Qatar and the Shiite-led government of Iraq, amid speculation that Shiite militia members in southern Iraq may have been responsible. Iraq’s foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, has denied suggestions that his government had anything to do with the abduction. “There are security flaws that we must acknowledge, and our enemies exploited the security shortcomings,” Mr. Jafari said.

Moving behind a curtain of secrecy, he dispatched two of his most trusted aides on sudden missions to Europe to see if they can get peace talks under way. Mr. Johnson’s roving ambassador, Averell Harriman, turned up unexpectedly in Warsaw to get across to the Communist world that North Vietnam must agree to talks. Almost simultaneously, Arthur Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, flew secretly into Rome to enlist the Pope in the effort to settle the war. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Dec. 30, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/1965-johnson-starts-bid-for-peace/

Many of today’s Americans were pretty young then, too — certainly too young to remember the glee with which United States policy makers watched the war, an eight-year storm of steel that killed as many as a million people and exhausted two unsavory regimes. The most famous line about the war is also the most fatuous. Henry Kissinger is said to have remarked that it was “a shame there can only be one loser.” In fact, they both lost: Few modern wars have so thoroughly broken, traumatized and destroyed both sides, and few have turned out to have had such disfiguring effects on the region or on American foreign policy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/the-iran-iraq-war-by-pierre-razoux.html

2015-12-30,"An Appraisal: Scott Rothkopf, Chief Curator at the Whitney, Recalls Ellsworth Kelly","Words like joy, delight and wonder don’t have a lot of currency in serious contemporary art criticism, which tends to prize skepticism and anxiety over supposedly easier pleasures. But it was precisely those former feelings that overcame me when I first encountered Ellsworth Kelly’s work en masse as a college student at his staggering 1996 retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The artist filled Frank Lloyd Wright’s signature rotunda with a confetti explosion of jaunty yellow ovals, crisp blue rectangles and vivid red curves, delivering an effervescent jolt that changed the course of my life and my interest in art. His paintings were strict yet somehow sprightly, and they tended to arouse emotions that one would be hard-pressed to ascribe to Mr. Kelly’s equally rigorous contemporaries in the field of abstraction.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/arts/design/an-appraisal-scott-rothkopf-chief-curator-at-the-whitney-recalls-ellsworth-kelly.html

Some register as generically prickly, full of vinegar and spit (a few may just be tired after a day’s work); others sag, as if deflating one breath at a time under an unfathomable weight.

Mr. Kaboré, a former prime minister, won an election last month that outside observers described as the first free and competitive vote in the country in decades. Burkina Faso’s former leader Blaise Compaoré was deposed in October 2014 after protests over his attempt to amend the Constitution and extend his 27 years in power. This month a military court in Burkina Faso issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Compaoré, who lives in exile in Ivory Coast, in connection with the 1987 assassination of Capt. Thomas Sankara, the country’s revolutionary leader. Mr. Compaoré has denied involvement in the killing.

Many years later, Retief’s legacy — a thorny mix of heroism, nationalism and racism — haunts his fictional descendant, Frank McAllister, the present-day narrator of Justin Cartwright’s latest novel, “Up Against the Night.” The battle provides the only sound archival root for what becomes a gratifyingly unsound psychological odyssey.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/up-against-the-night-by-justin-cartwright.html
2015-12-31,"‘One Out of Two,’ by Daniel Sada","The Mexican writer Daniel Sada’s second novel to appear in English, “One Out of Two,” is a spry addition to the genre of spinster sister fiction. Sada, who died in 2011, was as prolific as he was mischievous. Between his birth in Mexicali in 1953 and his death at 58, he published 20 books of fiction and poetry, all of them consistently unpredictable. In “One Out of Two,” Sada’s interest in spinster escapades is foremost in the opportunities they create for playing around with sexual tension and transgression.

2015-12-31,"‘Suspicious Minds,’ by Rob Brotherton","For all the talk of Donald Trump’s unpresidential behavior, the Republican enfant terrible does share one notable trait with that paragon of presidentiality, George Washington: a fondness for conspiracy theories. Washington once wrote in a letter that he believed an Illuminati conspiracy was at work in America, while Trump is the figurehead of the birther movement, which claims Barack Obama is not a natural-born American citizen. The psychologist and science journalist Rob Brotherton’s new book, “Suspicious Minds: Why We Believe Conspiracy ­Theories,” helps explain why someone with such seemingly outlandish views can gain widespread public support. It turns out we are all conspiracy theorists. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/suspicious-minds-by-rob-brotherton.html

A master of the domestic, Holland takes us again into that sphere: into the life of Bird, a stay-at-home mother of two children, as she moves through the events of a single day. Bird readies her son for school, sees her husband out the door, takes a bath with the baby. An old friend calls, and they share stories about the past. Bird takes the baby for a walk, and they stop by a pond, enjoying some time on the grass. Returning home, she flips through a photo album, talks on the phone again and hangs up in time to share the last moments of sunlight with the baby before greeting her son at the school bus.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/bird-by-noy-holland.html

Abba Eban, Israel’s eloquent and admired representative to the United Nations, thought the response was over the top and wrote a letter to Prime Minister David Ben-­Gurion condemning the raid. At the United Nations, meanwhile, Eban defended the operation, assailing Syria’s implacable hostility. Ben-Gurion wrote back to Eban saying he himself had had doubts about the retaliation but “when I read the full text of your brilliant defense of our action in the Security Council, all my doubts were set to rest.

2015-12-31,"‘Infectious Madness,’ by Harriet A. Washington","One hundred and sixty odd years ago, Ignaz Semmelweis realized that physicians who didn’t wash their hands were carrying tiny germs from bedside to bedside and causing the childbed fever that killed many women. After doctors began washing their hands, fewer women died. The series of realizations in the 19th century that germs — bacteria and viruses — caused diseases like cholera and tuberculosis and influenza ushered in modern medicine. Mortality rates declined; children lived longer. Germ theory had a dramatic clarity to it. It pushed medicine away from holistic conceptions of illness as imbalance toward conceptions of illness as a specific entity. You get the germ, you fall sick, you take antibiotics or fight it off (or die). Ironically, though, the tidiness of this relationship helped obscure cases where germs may have less direct but still devastating effects — a complex reality we are now beginning to understand better.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/books/review/infectious-madness-by-harriet-a-washington.html

2016-01-01,Review: Squeak Carnwath Speaks With Her Varied Palette,"Over the decades, Squeak Carnwath has cultivated a distinctive blend of disparate 1970s art movements, including New Image painting, Conceptual Art and above all Process Art. In her first solo show in New York in over a decade, her paintings fluently speak several languages at once. Areas of flat color are adrift with abstract and representational elements as well as writing — passing thoughts, the news, quips — often partly submerged in the shuffle of erasures and new additions. Everything contributes to the commentary. Tracts of cursive consider the income gap or light pollution, while little blocks of color allude to abstraction and a compass rose conjures cartography and sign painting.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/arts/design/review-squeak-carnwath-speaks-with-her-varied-palette.html
