2016-11-02,Atlantic Theater Company Has a New Musical From David Yazbek,"In 2001, the composer and lyricist David Yazbek, who wrote for “Late Night With David Letterman” for a stint in the early 1980s, told a Toronto newspaper: “I’d always wondered if I could write a song that could get the kind of laughs that a good sketch could get.” His career in musical theater has made that possible, starting in 2000 with his delightful Broadway debut “The Full Monty,” a charming musical that was funnier than the 1997 movie. He has since worked in many mediums, including television and cabaret, but has written a new musical about every five years. His latest, which starts previews Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Friday, Nov. 11, is another adaptation, this time of the movie “The Band’s Visit,” about an Egyptian group that arrives in Israel to play a show but ends up stranded in a remote village after a mix-up at the border. Itamar Moses wrote the book, and David Cromer, who replaced Hal Prince, directs a cast that includes John Cariani and Tony Shalhoub.

Jonah Bokaer, a former member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, relishes choreographic games. And “Rules of the Game,” his new dance production, is a puzzle of artistic layers. It takes its title from a work by the great Italian dramatist Luigi Pirandello, as well as another play that is being rehearsed by actors in Pirandello’s “Six Characters in Search of an Author,” who find themselves invaded by characters from still another, but unfinished, drama. Mr. Bokaer said that although his creation is plotless, his choreography subtly links each dancer to someone in “Six Characters.” It haunts the production, designed by Daniel Arsham (with new music by Pharrell Williams), with Pirandello ghosts. Mr. Bokaer’s program, which celebrates 10 years of collaborating with Mr. Arsham, also includes “Recess,” a solo, and — more games — “Why Patterns,” in which dancers interact with multitudes of table tennis balls.

2016-11-02,Mary J. Blige and Maxwell at the Garden,"Depending on the artist, when the personal bleeds aggressively into the professional, it can be a recipe for either messiness or motivation. For Mary J. Blige, the veteran R&B belter who’s at her best when emotionally charged, heartbreak is inspiration. This summer, she filed for divorce from her husband of more than a decade and longtime manager, but instead of cowering from tabloid headlines, she has worked them into her live show. A recent single, “Thick of It,” from her coming album “Strength of a Woman,” is similarly defiant: “Who’s gonna love you like I do? Who will you trust? I gave you too much.” That combination of vulnerability and resilience can be expected when Ms. Blige and Maxwell, the progressive soul seducer, headline Madison Square Garden on Thursday, Nov. 10, as part of their “King and Queen of Hearts Tour.” “I don’t hold back,” Ms. Blige said recently, “and there’s no way I am going to start changing now.” (ticketmaster.com)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/arts/music/mary-j-blige-and-maxwell-at-the-garden.html

But somewhere beneath Morello’s ruby-red lipstick, cockeyed accent and histrionics lurks the Australian actress Yael Stone. And in “Deep Water,” a crime thriller debuting Monday, Nov. 7, on Acorn TV, she’s virtually unrecognizable. Her face scrubbed bare and her vowels subdued, Ms. Stone plays Tori Lustigman, a police detective investigating a vicious killing with sexual undercurrents in a suburb of Sydney. But when a clue links the case to a similar one from 26 years earlier, Tori uncovers 70 possible murders of gay men spanning decades along New South Wales’s glorious shoreline — and the possibility that the culprit is back at it. “Every day, Tori, you come to work prepared to give up your life to protect others,” her boss says. “But you’ve got a son.

2016-11-03,Letter of Recommendation: ‘Pinky and the Brain’,"During an interview I did with Conan O’Brien a while back, we drifted onto the topic of rules: when it was prudent, as a creative person, to flout conventions, and when it made sense to obey them. As O’Brien saw it, only ever flouting, without a healthy dose of obeying, was unsustainable and, on balance, unfunny. To illustrate, he told me a story, one that didn’t make it into the piece I wrote but stuck with me nonetheless: A well-known comedian with a raucous persona, interested in developing his own talk show, once sought O’Brien’s advice. “He showed me a prototype of what it would be: He comes out, he runs through the audience, he’s never in one place. He’s everywhere, he’s nowhere, he’s wearing different clothes, spray-painting on the walls — total anarchy,” O’Brien recalled. “And I said, O.K., here’s my take: You’re a brilliantly funny person, but you need to be constrained, because when you break those constraints, it’s enormously satisfying.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-pinky-and-the-brain.html

2016-11-03,Want to Know What Virtual Reality Might Become? Look to the Past,"The Scottish scientist David Brewster was one of those 19th-century characters with no real equivalent today. An ordained minister in the Church of Scotland, he took an early interest in astronomy and became for a time one of the world’s leading experts on the science of optics. He also harbored a great fondness for popular amusements, and at some point in the early part of the century, he began frequenting a theatrical horror show in the West End of London called the Phantasmagoria. He went in part as a debunker, a skeptic hoping to reveal the secret craft behind the spectacle. But he also sensed that something profound was lurking in the trickery. He suspected that the showmen were exploiting some intrinsic quirks in the human sensory system — perhaps, he hoped, rendering them more intelligible to the scientist. Brewster called the world of scientifically produced illusion “natural magic.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/magazine/want-to-know-what-virtual-reality-might-become-look-to-the-past.html

With his sinewy frame and defiant stare, Iggy’s image has been immortalized by the likes of photographer Mick Rock (on the cover of his band The Stooges’ third album, “Raw Power”) as well as the artists Peter Hujar and Gerard Malanga. “I knew him from the imagery before the music, actually,” recalls the Turner Prize-winning British artist Jeremy Deller. “Even in photos you can tell he has a presence and is clearly quite a character.” For Deller, it was Iggy’s baring of his torso and soul onstage that struck him: “He’s not stopped performing,” Deller says. “From the age of 20 to 69, it’s been a continuous piece of performance art and documentation of his body. It’s interesting to me for a man to parade his body so much, and parade it as it changes.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/t-magazine/iggy-pop-life-class-nude-drawing-brooklyn-museum.html

2016-11-04,Look It Up,"John Simpson, whose memoir, “The Word Detective,” is reviewed this week, was 22 years old and a freshly minted master of medieval studies when he was hired by the Oxford English Dictionary, in 1976. Even though he didn’t know it at the time, he would soon learn that the O.E.D. — a “historical dictionary,” to distinguish it from its merely lexicographic brethren — hired “a lot of medievalists,” he said in a phone interview. “If you know the early stuff, you can look forward to what happens later.” What won’t get you hired by the O.E.D. are moony declarations of how much you “love words.” Such ardor, after all, might come at the expense of being able to treat words as objects for analysis. In “The Word Detective,” Simpson recalls he was also wary of inveterate typers (“We normally asked for handwritten letters”), poor spellers (of course) and those who claim to “enjoy” crossword puzzles. He reserved particular opprobrium for cover letters that included the job-application cliché “hone” (“I honed my lexicographic skills through a passionate love of words and my enjoyment of crossword puzzles”).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/books/review/john-simpson-talks-about-word-detective.html

Under the name Blackcreek Mercantile and Trading Co., which is perhaps best known for a range of understated black cutting boards, he and a small team craft by hand one-of-a-kind pieces that honor the unique qualities of the wood they carve, from the curve of a branch to artful cracks. “When I founded my studio,” Vogel explained on a recent Saturday, “I felt like I needed to break everything back down to one part, one piece, and then start over again. I wanted to focus on these very basic, pure aspects of woodworking and also the wood itself.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/t-magazine/design/blackcreek-mercantile-trading-co-joshua-vogel-store.html

On this visit, the company presents their works “Stop-Motion,” where dancers slide through white dust like ghosts on a ski slope, and “Safe as Houses,” where they are chased by a massive rotating wall to the sounds of Bach. Also on the program are new creations by the sharp associate choreographers Crystal Pite and Marco Goecke. She sets the action on a long table and clads her dancers in suits and ties, like a corporate thriller; he interprets the acoustic love songs of Jeff Buckley. On Tuesday, Nov. 15, the company will offer a preview as part of the Guggenheim’s Works and Process series.

The Museum of Modern Art remembers a time when he was still on his way to becoming a household name when it shows “Bachelor Party,” his 1984 comedy, on Sunday, Nov. 13, as part of “Tom Hanks: A Tribute.” Mr. Hanks played half of a couple headed toward the altar (Tawny Kitaen played his fiancée) when the event of the film’s title disrupts things. “Mr. Hanks’s suave smart-alecky manner owes a lot to Bill Murray, but he’s funny and engaging even if he isn’t doing anything new,” Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film shows at 5:30 p.m. At 2:30 that same afternoon, “Big” (1988) will be screened; on Monday, at 4 p.m., comes “A League of Their Own” (1992).

He is the Ukrainian-born, wildly gifted former Royal Ballet dancer who became a principal at 19, then caused a sensation by walking out in 2012 amid mutual allegations of ill treatment. The British press ate up the mildly salacious rumors of drug abuse, tattoos and high living that ensued, and Mr. Polunin — about whom a documentary film has recently been made — became famous beyond the dance world, hitting a viral streak (close to 17 million views to date) on YouTube in a solo filmed by David LaChapelle.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/arts/dance/a-star-ballet-natalia-osipova-sergei-polunin-couple-take-a-contemporary-turn-natalia-osipova-and-artists-new-york-city-center.html

Ryan Weideman, a photographer who drove a taxi shift to make ends meet, decided to let them know that he was. It was 1980, four years after the movie “Taxi Driver” was released, and Mr. Weideman had a master’s degree in fine arts and a tenuous grasp of New York City geography. He also had a camera and the best studio he could ask for: a roomy old Checker cab that was his from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. on weekends, when traffic thinned and tips were not always something he could count on. Turning the camera on his fares was a way to displace his rage at the inequities that come with a taxi, where the customer holds all the power and the driver does all the work. Sometimes he snapped people at the beginning of a ride, sometimes after he reached their destination. He mounted a strobe light onto the cab’s sun visor using rubber bands. He wasn’t fancy. Usually he asked permission, but at least once he said simply, “Don’t move, I’m a photographer,” and started shooting.",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/a-taxi-drivers-photos-of-new-york/

And yet, the uncertainty of the outcome at the time we published them suits the theme of this special issue: our current mania with redesigning, tweaking, optimizing, improving, refreshing and updating everything.

2016-11-10,An Outerwear Brand Finds Its Place in Fashion — and in SoHo,"Lately Canada Goose, the 59-year-old outerwear brand best known for its fur-trimmed black parkas, has been found not just in wintry climes but on runways. In February, Marc Jacobs paired one of his floor-grazing sequined skirts with a men’s Manitoba coat, adding feathers, while Vetements deconstructed and puffed up two classic styles. Opening Ceremony’s (slimmer) takes were eye-catching for their use of color and print — think purple paisley. This month, Canada Goose becomes a full-fledged member of the downtown scene with the inauguration of a SoHo flagship. (It opens on the heels of a Toronto outpost, the company’s first stand-alone store.) Amid raw marble detailing sourced from British Columbia, shoppers can rest on soft maple benches by the Ontario millworker DB Johnson and other seating from the Montreal-based Montauk Sofa company. They’ll also find a celebration of soapstone-carved polar bear sculptures by the contemporary Aboriginal artist Jason Carter. “Storytelling was a crucial part of the design,” says chief executive officer Dani Reiss. “Stories like how we were there when Laurie Skreslet was the first Canadian to summit Mt. Everest.” Add to that tales of the brand’s fashion-world ascent.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/t-magazine/fashion/canada-goose-new-york-store.html

Instead, they resemble angular, faceted rocks made of materials as diverse as Carrara marble or plywood, maybe embedded with a moose antler.

We soon learn that one of its main characters is running for Congress. Even though it’s the middle of December.

The two very different expressive painters were both restless experimenters. Frustrated with the formal limitations of the Chinese academy, Zao left for Paris in 1948, while de Kooning, born in the Netherlands and also classically trained, arrived in New York in 1927. The artists found their signature styles around the same time: de Kooning’s infamous “Woman” canvases, exhibited in 1953, broke his association with Abstract Expressionism, and his aggressive dismantling of the female body still unsettles. A year later, Zao changed brushes and technique to create his signature chaotic landscapes. His swirling “4-6-62” has the feel of a tornado, or an atom bomb. Lévy describes the show as “a combat between two giants.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/t-magazine/art/willem-de-kooning-zao-wou-ki-two-men-show.html

During his free time, like many of his peers, Mr. Kéré had to work, spending hours fixing crudely built homes, which were in a perpetual state of disrepair. “In my heart, I felt even then that I wanted to build things better one day, so that kids like me would be free to learn,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/arts/design/in-burkina-faso-rebuilding-with-a-local-touch.html

He created a modern classic with his diptych, “Untitled (Ferguson Police, August 13, 2014),” a photorealist depiction of Ferguson, Mo. police officers in riot gear, partly shrouded in a cloud of tear gas, the golden arches of a McDonald’s restaurant visible in the background. (He’d follow this thread further in 2016 with a drawing of the Baltimore police during the riots over the death of Freddie Gray.) His “Untitled (Football Players, Rams, Hands Up),” 2016, featured the St. Louis football team’s receivers entering the stadium for a game and making the “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture that has become a familiar symbol in Black Lives Matter protests.

Mr. Fajans was building a set for “Mondays With Merce,” a video series devoted to the work of the choreographer Merce Cunningham. Mr. Vaughan was the Cunningham company’s longtime archivist; Mr. Fajans eventually became Cunningham’s caretaker for 10 months until his death in 2009 and then, during the company’s final tour, looked after Mr. Vaughan. Despite their difference in ages — Mr. Vaughan is 92, Mr. Fajans 31 — they formed a deep bond.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/arts/dance/review-a-cross-generational-bond-conveyed-in-dance.html

They stopped listening to people on the left. Now we’re here in crazy town. What we need now is for reasonable people to sit down with each other and say: O.K., your guy wasn’t the end of the world.

There are 11 preset seasoning combinations, $6 to $11, though customers can devise their own. Tom Yum, a combo with chicken broth, coconut milk, curry and chile oil, is becoming a favorite. The shop also sells basic broths, frozen, for home use: Brodo, 496 Hudson Street (Christopher Street), 212-366-0600, brodo.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/dining/bone-broth-brodo-west-village-marco-canora.html

Trump’s finances, who concluded that the real-estate developer’s net worth was $150 million to $250 million, rather than the $2 billion to $5 billion Trump had variously claimed. Trump, who had courted O’Brien by taking him for rides in his Ferrari and private jet, sued O’Brien for libel in New Jersey in 2006. Trump called O’Brien a “wack job” on the “Today” show — while, O’Brien says, continuing to curry favor with him privately. O’Brien’s publisher, Warner Books, was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put Trump through an unsparing two-day deposition. Asked about his finances, Trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times. “He thought he’d get a friendly judge, and we would roll over,” says O’Brien, who is now the executive editor of Bloomberg View. “We didn’t.” The case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/magazine/billionaires-vs-the-press-in-the-era-of-trump.html

Mr. Lopez is also a partner in Gun Hill Brewing Company, in the north Bronx, near Gun Hill Road. The tavern will serve its own beers, with names pulled from history, given that there was a Revolutionary War battle at Gun Hill. (One of the beers, Rise Up Rye, is poured at the Richard Rodgers Theater, where “Hamilton” is playing.) Everything in a glass is from New York State, including other beers, wines, ciders and spirits. The tavern pours a kind of refined Puerto Rican moonshine called Pitorro from Port Morris Distillery next door, also a partner in the tavern. Other whiskeys include some made in-house and used to flavor homemade ice cream: 780 East 133rd Street (Willow Avenue), Port Morris, Bronx, 718-585-3192, gunhillbrewing.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/dining/gun-hill-tavern-opens-in-the-bronx.html

In an atelier above the glamorous Manhattan shop he opened in 1948, the genteel Southerner fashioned extravagant bejeweled creations — often in the shape of exotic animals — that were coveted by Elizabeth Taylor, Lana Turner and Barbra Streisand. Diana Vreeland often wore Webb’s zebra bangle with ruby eyes. Thanks to the 40,000 sketches left behind after his death in 1975, his iconic designs have continued to live on — including this recently reissued modernist gold and black enamel cuff. Designed by Webb in 1971, it juxtaposes opaque and translucent gems in a bold geometric composition of carved coral and diamonds surrounding a massive 58-carat Brazilian citrine.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/t-magazine/fashion/david-webb-jewel-enamel-cuff.html

2016-11-29,Itineraries Await in the Season’s Best Travel Books,"Traveling can be complicated and nervous-making, yet for many of us the compulsion to be propelled across the map and renewed amid unfamiliar landscapes is irresistible. As Bill Bryson writes in his introduction to THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2016 (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $14.95), which highlights two dozen locations across the globe, travel is “enriching, stimulating, seductive, pleasurable — but very often a touch compulsive, too.” For an example of all these qualities, consult Gretel Ehrlich’s ravishing, troubling essay about her perilous journeys by dog sled on the melting ice floes off Greenland’s coast. (“When I asked if we were going to die, he smiled and said, ‘Imaqa.’ Maybe.”) Yet some travelers do seem to have reined in their wanderlust, alert to geopolitical flux. Five years ago, I learned the prudence of such caution when friends emailed me in alarm from Damascus, where they had been lured by an article I’d written about the city’s beguiling old-town souk — and had landed just as Syria’s civil war began. My apologies! But not everyone is deterred by warfare or global warming. A batch of new books bridges the gap between the timid and the intrepid wanderer, showing that with planning, a little luck and a modicum of attention to headlines, the world’s most arresting sights, tastes and wonders can still be yours — whether you conduct your journey in the 50 states, overseas, from the sanctuary of an armchair or from the bobbing back of a camel.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/books/review/new-travel-books.html

Gloss stars, by contrast, eat up the light like a cat sunbathing on a windowsill. They strut with the room-temperature ease of toddlers showing off to their parents. Think of the peacock thrill of being looked at that John Travolta evinces in “Grease” or Tom Hanks in “Big” or Jennifer Lawrence in anything besides “The Hunger Games.” Theirs is an egoless egotism that, by dint of the generosity with which it is offered up, yields audiences the promise of transcended, liberated self.

2016-11-30,Wrapping 4 Dances Into 1 at 100 Grand Street,"Thirty years ago, Bill Young inaugurated a new performance space at 100 Grand Street with a program of four dances bearing the overall title of “Interleaving.” To celebrate the anniversary of that space and event, he is recreating “Interleaving” with a new cast of 14 dancers for his unusual choreographic concept. The four dances have traditional beginnings, middles and ends, but instead of a linear presentation of those sections, Mr. Young has grouped them together: All four beginnings are performed sequentially, then all four middles and, finally, all four ends. Reviewing the original production for The New York Times in 1987, Jennifer Dunning wrote that all of these forming and dissolving bits of movement were like daubs of color, making “Interleaving” resemble “an activated Jackson Pollock painting.” Any way you look at it, it’s four dances in one.

His albums are filled with jazzy retellings of classic stories (“A Christmas Carol,” “The Raven”) or historical incidents (the Gettysburg Address) in eccentric slang that mixed aristocratic airs with beatnik styles.

There’s a person inside those covers — someone whose voice is appealing, whose guidance is reliable and whose food evokes the world you wish you lived in. Today’s culinary celebrities may be photographed far more sumptuously than their predecessors, and their recipes may be more overtly dazzling, but their books make the same promise that once lured homemakers to Mrs. Beeton, Fannie Farmer, Betty Crocker and Julia Child. Cook like me, they’re all saying. Try this recipe, try that one.

Aliquippa rode World War II and its aftermath — “War eats steel,” Price writes in hard-boiled style — to the point where, by 1950, the United States produced nearly half the world’s steel.

His pictures have an identifiable look: black-and-white, grainy, off-center, tilted, high-contrast — but within those bounds he has covered an encyclopedic range of subjects and approaches in the dozens of books he has published since the early 1970s. (Note that such a figure is not unusual for photographers in Japan, where books are often small, cheap and quickly produced — conditions that favor grain and high contrast.) In his newest, DAIDO TOKYO (Fondation Cartier Pour l’Art Contemporain/Thames & Hudson, $40), he counters expectations: Half the pages are in color. His subject is Shinjuku, the neighborhood around Tokyo’s major train station, historically not unlike Times Square: filled with bars and love hotels, rife with low-level crime and lurid advertising. It has been gentrified somewhat in recent decades, and also features verdant parks and sleek skyscrapers, but Moriyama nevertheless locates all his favorite textures: fishnet, chain-link, steel tubing, tangled cables, broken glass, torn posters, cracked PVC, dust.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/books/review/a-spotlight-on-the-seasons-top-photography-books.html
