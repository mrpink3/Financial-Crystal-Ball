2011-10-03,Canada: Court Saves Drug Injection Center from Shutdown," An effort by the Conservative government to close the only center in North America where addicts may legally inject drugs was thwarted by the country’s Supreme Court in a unanimous decision released Friday. In 2008, the government said it would not extend the center’s exemption from federal narcotics laws, a position endorsed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Insite center in Vancouver, British Columbia, does not supply drugs, but allows addicts to inject them without fear of arrest under medical supervision on the condition that they undergo treatment. The court ruled that denying that permit and closing the clinic violated its users’ constitutional rights by “threatening their health and indeed their lives.” The justices also said that “during its eight years of operation, Insite has been proven to save lives with no discernible negative impact on the public safety and health objectives of Canada.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/world/americas/canada-court-saves-drug-injection-center-from-shutdown.html

2011-10-04,Backstage Beauty Report | Stella McCartney,"“It’s a bit of a battle,” said Pat McGrath backstage at Stella McCartney of making sure that models’ tan bodies match their often paler faces. “We’re warming up with the foundation.” There wasn’t much else required in the way of makeup, save for Covergirl’s Lushberry creme blush, Lash Perfect mascara and some lip balm. “Fresh, beautiful, gorgeous, glowing, young and alive,” is how McGrath sees the Stella girl. “Spontaneous and real,” was Eugene Souleiman’s description of the designer, which he translated as a bun slicked back at the sides with texture on top. To create this look, he separated a horseshoe of hair all around the head, pulling it back tightly into a ponytail polished with a makeup brush coated in Wella hair spray. The crown was then roughed up with a little of Wella’s Refined Texture product. Souleiman explained that sometimes it’s more difficult to come up with a simple look than, say, one that is high concept. That wasn’t an issue today. “With Stella, it just kind of happens,” he said. “You’re never trying too hard.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/backstage-beauty-report-stella-mccartney/

The Baltimore Ravens defeated the Jets, 34-17, on “Sunday Night Football” to give NBC a ratings win in all viewership categories. Final audience numbers were not available on Monday afternoon. CBS finished second over all with new episodes of “The Amazing Race” and “The Good Wife,” though the numbers were skewed higher because of N.F.L. coverage overruns across the country.

Without the service, they fear isolation, and in some cases, economic calamity. Butte, Mont.; Muscle Shoals, Ala.; Waterloo, Iowa; Pierre, S.D.; Greenville and Tupelo, Miss.; Sault Sainte Marie, Mich.; and Hibbing, Minn., are among the cities where the flights are threatened. Residents of Hibbing, population 16,000, and the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range — where iron-ore mining is the predominant industry — are particularly concerned.

It exists alongside Dr. Spock’s child-rearing guide, Strunk and White’s volume on literary style and Fannie Farmer’s cookbook as a classic expression of the American impulse toward self-improvement and reinvention.

So it can be more than a little jarring to hear, for example, James Mohler, chairman of the urology department and associate director of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, say of his friend: “I have known Otis for over 20 years. He doesn’t come off as being ignorant or stupid, but when it comes to prostate-cancer screening, he must not be as intelligent as he seems.” Or Skip Lockwood, the head of Zero, a prostate-cancer patient advocacy group, charge that Brawley is more concerned about saving men’s sex lives than about saving the men themselves.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/magazine/can-cancer-ever-be-ignored.html

The Coens, the Academy Award-winning writer-directors of “No Country for Old Men” and “Fargo,” are collaborating with the “Cedar Rapids” screenwriter Phil Johnston on a television series called “Harve Karbo,” about another hapless aspiring Sam Spade. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the oddly specific series will chronicle “a touchy Los Angeles private investigator — and his deadbeat friends in El Segundo — whose cases frequently force him to cross paths with a who’s who of Hollywood,” and if that sounds at least a little Lebowski-esque, we can abide. The series, which the Coens will produce for Imagine Television and for which Mr. Johnston will write the script, has so far received a pilot commitment from Fox, which means there are still, you know, a lotta ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous, before “Harve Karbo” appears on your screen.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/coen-brothers-producing-comedy-pilot-for-fox/

He’ll be attacked for nanny-state-ism by his own members, of course, but Britain’s highest-in-Europe obesity rate (third in the world, after the U.S. and Mexico) and the dangers to the National Health system – the oldest single-payer system in the world and perhaps the largest (depends how you measure) — could make this interesting.",Opinion,https://bittman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/fat-tax-update/

The environmental group’s original request had centered on communication between the State Department and Paul Elliott, the chief Washington lobbyist for TransCanada, the pipeline company. Mr. Elliott was a senior official in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid. On Wednesday, the group expanded its request to cover several other lobbyists now working for TransCanada who held senior positions for Mrs. Clinton and President Obama during their campaigns. These include Jeff Berman of Bryan Cave LLC, who was national delegate director for the Obama presidential campaign.

There were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov. There were the Colette novels she read on the sly. There was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot. There was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn’t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth. And then you waited for the result, hoping for “Artistic,” or “Passionate,” thinking you could live with “Sensitive,” secretly fearing “Narcissistic” and “Domestic,” but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: “Incurably Romantic.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/books/the-marriage-plot.html

After a 24-hour search that involved dogs, helicopters and hundreds of law officers, three sheriff’s deputies on patrol spotted a man crouching behind a car in Sunnyvale, about 40 miles south of San Francisco, officials said. Sheriff Laurie Smith of Santa Clara County said all three deputies fired at the man after he showed a gun “in a threatening manner” and they recognized him as Shareef Allman, 47. The authorities say Mr. Allman walked into a Cupertino limestone quarry where he worked on Wednesday and opened fire. He then fled and wounded a seventh person while trying to steal her car for his escape, the authorities said. The man shot by the sheriff’s deputies was pronounced dead at the scene. The coroner had not confirmed his identity as of Thursday evening, but Sheriff Smith said the body matched the description of Mr. Allman.

2011-10-07,A State is Born in Palestine,"Sixty-four years ago, in August 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine presented to the General Assembly a startling and unexpected report, calling for an end to the British Mandate of Palestine and division of most of the territory into two independent states, with the Jewish state occupying the majority of the land. What came next, of course, is well known — a vote in the General Assembly on Nov. 29, 1947, in favor of partition, and the war that immediately followed. The decision is viewed in the Arab world as “the great crime,” and Palestinian leaders, including the current president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, regard it as the original sin that led to the catastrophe, the nakba, that befell their nation — a disaster they now want the General Assembly to remedy. What is not widely known is how a possibly pro-Arab committee, or at least one that was supposed to be neutral, came to issue a report that led directly to the establishment of the state of Israel. What happened on that committee’s trip to Palestine, and how were the minds of its members changed in a way that so radically altered history?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/magazine/a-state-is-born-in-palestine.html

2011-10-07,Week 5 N.F.L. Matchups: Another Turning Point,"Packers (4-0) at Falcons (2-2)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Packers by 6.Tramon Williams’s end-of-half interception return for the Packers against the Falcons in last year’s playoffs may be remembered as a turning point in N.F.L. history. The Falcons were the better team entering the game, and while the Packers held a 21-14 lead before the play, the Falcons were driving and appeared likely to score. Williams’s interception turned the game into a rout, and the Packers have been unbeatable ever since, while the Falcons have replaced them as the team with a young quarterback and lots of talent that cannot quite get its act together.Of course, for some that turning point arrived a little late. “I’m really surprised that it kind of took him so long,” Brett Favre said of the three interminable years it took Aaron Rodgers to lead the Packers to the Super Bowl. Who knew that through all of those quasi-retirements, through his stints with the Jets and the Vikings, Favre was just impatiently waiting for Rodgers to close the deal? Favre did not sound as if  he was trying to insult Rodgers — he has simply lost the ability to compliment people who are not him — but teammates and analysts have rushed to Rodgers’s defense, which he does not really need.It had been peaceful months since the last self-serving Favre rant. What took him so long? Pick: Packers",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/week-5-n-f-l-matchups-another-turning-point/

In his 12th novel, “Lost Memory of Skin,” the formidable Russell Banks bravely explores this specific plight, trying to find humanity in people who are feared and despised, frequently for good reason, and raising questions not only about the often horrendous public treatment of these outcasts but also about the ways the larger culture may contribute to their crimes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/lost-memory-of-skin-by-russell-banks-book-review.html

Jim Jones orchestrated the deaths of more than 900 Americans. Well, not exactly untold. Over the past three decades, the massacre has been explored in numerous books and even several television documentaries. Yet the story does bear retelling, not least for those too young to recall the shock that swept the world at the time, but also because Scheeres adds insights harvested from some 50,000 pages of letters, journals and other documents found in Jonestown and recently released by the F.B.I. The result is a gripping account of how decent people can be taken in by a charismatic and crazed tyrant.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/a-thousand-lives-by-julia-scheeres-book-review.html
2011-10-07,Will the Large Hadron Collider Explain Everything?,"Lisa Randall is a professor of physics at Harvard and one of the more original theorists at work in the profession today. In the fancifully titled “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” her second book for a popular audience, she has two avowed aims: first, to explain where physics might be headed now that the Large Hadron Collider — the enormous particle accelerator on the Swiss-French border — is finally up and running; and second, to air her views on the nature of science, its fraught relations with religion, and the role of beauty as a guide to scientific truth. Her book thus alternates between the nitty-gritty of particle physics and meditations of a more rarefied sort. Stitching the whole thing together are passages recounting the author’s globe-trotting adventures: accepting the key to the city from the mayor of Padua, chatting up a scientifically curious actor on a flight to Los Angeles, attending the Barcelona premiere of an opera about physics for which she had written the libretto.

Lennon’s no hero of mine. I cannot separate people and what they do from what they are. Lennon was unmitigatedly evil as far as I was concerned.” Doesn’t that sound terrible, like a kind of spiritual deformity — hating John Lennon? Tangled deep in the nervous system of every earthling over the age of 40, I would argue, is some fiber or filament of peak Beatlemania, some flicker of the old wild adoration. We want, we need — still — to love these men. And yet Lennon in certain aspects was really quite hateable.

2011-10-07,Essays From One of Our Best Wishful Thinkers,"When, in 2005 and 2006, a mysterious sweet smell wafted across Staten Island, Brooklyn and Manhattan, it discomfited already jittery New Yorkers. The same thing happened again three years later, and the smell was finally identified: fenugreek, carried on breezes from a New Jersey flavor and fragrance factory. The incident reminded me of a passage in André Aciman’s fine 1995 memoir, “Out of Egypt,” in which he writes about the fragrance of hilba, fenugreek. Arab Egyptians drank it for its curative powers, and reeked afterward, but for many Alexandrian Jews who aspired to being European, nothing could be more déclassé than the smell of hilba. Aciman’s father called it une odeur d’arabe, an Arab smell, and hated any trace of it in the house or on his clothes. But, Aciman points out, “all homes bear ethnic odors,” and from the various smells of foods and perfumes the stories of communities and persons emerge. The opening chapter of “Alibis,” Aciman’s beautiful new book of essays, is an extended aria on the sense of smell.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/alibis-essays-on-elsewhere-by-andre-aciman-book-review.html

Worried about a chimney fire, one neighbor finally called the authorities. They discovered that the mansion’s basement was festooned with human bones, its coal stove burning body parts.

There’s John Maynard Keynes on the one side, arguing for deficit spending to offset the aftereffects of a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis.

2011-10-07,A Newspaper Columnist in Recovery,"This fine, small-scale novel by the Canadian writer David Bergen starts with the plight of a newspaper columnist who can no longer bear to use his family as fodder. Morris Schutt owes his wide readership to his “seeming annulment of the private” — the description of his older daughter’s live-in boyfriend as “rabbit-like, soft and pale with a curious nose that twitched”; the stories of his son, a university dropout who plays online poker. Yet after his son is killed while serving in Afghanistan, Morris begins “to lose his grasp of himself.” In one of his last columns, before his agent makes him take a break, he shifts from his reader-pleasing first-person voice to the “alienating” second person and echoes a 17th-century mystic: “The wheel turns and you have no destination where to arrive.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/the-matter-with-morris-by-david-bergen-book-review.html

Members of this group are ardent peddlers of conspiracy theories, anti-intellectualism and the demonization of opponents. This approach has contributed in no small way to the sorry state of contemporary American politics, where epithets have replaced arguments, a sense of common destiny seems lacking among citizens and compromise has become almost impossible on the most pressing national issues.

2011-10-07,Erin Morgenstern’s Magician Death Match,"Let me say at the outset that glamour and charm are notoriously difficult qualities to render on the page, and all those words like “mercury” and “lightning” and “ineffability” certainly apply, ditto “catching,” “capturing” and “chasing.” It may well be the case that we still hold “The Great Gatsby” in such high esteem because of those amazing parties to which none of us will ever be invited, and wouldn’t have been in the 1920s, either. If glamour were easy, the entire fashion industry could do its thing on Sunday afternoons with a spool of thread and a few yards of gauze. Moreover, for the true geniuses of glamour, a spool of thread and a few yards of gauze are all it takes to make one feel that one is Marie Antoinette spinning around Versailles. For the rest of us, glamour is a sweaty struggle, rife with pricked thumbs, bulges and gaffes. This is why it is a risky business indeed to devote nearly 400 pages to a confection called le Cirque des Rêves, a circus that occurs at night (as opposed to what other sort of circus, by the way?) and is famous, apparently, for doing wild, magical, life-changing, impossible things. Like a magician, the writer must pull the rabbit from the hat, cut the lady in half, make the elephant disappear and so on. We long to be fooled. In “The Night Circus,” her debut novel, Erin Morgenstern works hard to create just such a sense of magic, but there finally seems to be something too sensible about her sensibility to pull off the trick. The novel is — and it’s an odd thing to say about a work of fiction — just too real to be believed. True magic is dangerous, and there is little of that sort of propulsive danger in these pages; where it does occur is surprising, and oddly marginalized.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/the-night-circus-by-erin-morgenstern-book-review.html

2011-10-07,Inside the List,"HEMINGWAY IN LOVE: Ernest Hemingway has been having a tough few months. First, he gets slapped around in Paula McLain’s best-­selling revenge novel “The Paris Wife,” which retells the story of his years in France from the point of view of his jilted first wife, Hadley Richardson. Then he’s mocked in Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” as a self-serious blowhard. But a little bit of rehabilitation is on the way, thanks to “Hemingway’s Boat,” Paul Hendrickson’s sympathetic biography (new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list), not to mention the first installment of Hemingway’s complete letters, just out from Cambridge University Press. That project, which includes previously unseen materials from the Finca Vigía, Hemingway’s estate outside Havana, reminds us why we fell in love with the guy to begin with — or at least why Hadley did, even if his spelling and grammar weren’t always so hot. The book — the first of a projected 16 volumes — includes his earliest recorded love letter to “Hash,” written a few days before Christmas 1920. (Hadley burned most of his letters to her after they divorced in 1927.) “You can make me jealous — and you can hurt most awfully — ’cause my loving you is a chink in the armour of telling the world to go to hell and you can thrust a sword into it at any time,” Hemingway wrote, before explaining why he hadn’t kissed her goodbye on the train platform. “Lord — I thot I was loving you — If I wasnt I never could and never would love any one. Guess I was thinking too much about how I didn’t want you to go — Don’t you believe I love you? . . . I didn’t want to kiss you goodbye — that was the trouble — I wanted to kiss you good night — and there’s a lot of difference.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But that should not happen with this week’s issue. The mix of stories is the best we’ve assembled so far, starting with Jeffrey Gettleman’s epic pirates tale. It is an exciting, dramatic work of narrative journalism overflowing with memorable moments like this: “Once the pirates were in control of the Lynn Rival, they ransacked it, flinging open cupboards, eating all of the Chandlers’ cookies and stealing their money, watches, rings, electronics, their satellite phone and clothes.” Yup, those mean pirates went right for the cookies.

The musicians’ contract expired on Sept. 20, but they have continued to perform, not an unusual practice. Several musicians say the atmosphere seems tenser than in the past, amid fears that a diminished contract could induce players to leave for teaching jobs or other top-tier orchestras like the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony. At the same time, the orchestra has 16 openings. Members of the orchestra’s negotiating committee declined to comment. In a statement the orchestra’s management said the strike authorization vote, held last week, was “standard procedure” and had no effect on its desire to reach an agreement. “While there are serious issues under consideration, we are hopeful that a new agreement will be reached, and that the orchestra will continue to perform according to the published concert schedule,” management said. Both sides “are currently engaged in negotiations,” it added, but orchestra officials declined to elaborate or to provide details on contacts between the sides.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/music/philharmonic-union-authorizes-strike.html

At the conclusion of the interview, a flustered Cherie Blair rushed in to join the party, apparently after overhearing from the next room too many questions concerning reports that had run in the conservative tabloid that has dogged the Blairs for decades. “I couldn’t resist coming in after hearing all that Daily Mail nonsense,” she declared. Here’s what was left on the cutting room floor.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/tony-blair-they-keep-insinuating-and-i-keep-saying-its-not-true/

The novelist Jonathan Ames, the show’s creator, works out his love-hate relationship to the city’s writing life (and those who live it) with a mix of whimsy and precise observation that can make even the most cleverly written network sitcoms — “Modern Family,” “Community” — seem mass produced and one-size-fits-all in comparison.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/channel-surfing-bored-to-death/

2011-10-11,Norman’s Conquest,"In the American fall collections of 1960, Norman Norell did something seemingly too radical for a man who ate most of his meals at Schrafft’s and Hamburg Heaven. He had his models paint their faces in the bohemian-urchin style of Paris in the ’20s, with darkened eyes and red lips, finished off with shingle haircuts. Then he put the girls in pants. Technically these were split skirts, but who cares? The effect was the same. Long before Yves Saint Laurent issued le smoking, square Norman was there. “They may seem a little avant-garde at first,” he told The Times after his 1960 show, for which he received a standing ovation, “but I really do believe in the look.” He had uncanny instincts for anticipating change: the elongated sweater look, the return of waistlines in the mid-’60s, the dolman-sleeve rage of the early ’70s. He showed leopard patterns in the ’40s. The flapper makeup told a lot about Norell as well: stage-struck at an early age, he designed costumes in the ’20s at the Astoria studio of Paramount Pictures, dressing Gloria Swanson in “Zaza,” and later worked on Broadway musicals and burlesque shows before moving to ladies’ fashion.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/normans-conquest/

2011-10-12,Motherwell Painting Declared a Forgery,"A forged Robert Motherwell painting was branded with the equivalent of a scarlet letter on Tuesday in a legal settlement involving three art galleries and the Dedalus Foundation, which owns the copyrights to Motherwell’s works. “Spanish Elegy,” the painting at the center of the dispute, was sold to a European gallery, Killala Fine Art, for $650,000 in 2007 by Julian Weissman, who had previously worked as a salesman at Knoedler & Company in Manhattan. Before the sale Dedalus initially concluded that “Spanish Elegy” was authentic, but later backtracked and declared the work, supposedly painted by Motherwell in 1953, to be a fake. The Killala gallery said in its lawsuit that it had relied on the foundation’s assurance in making the purchase. Mr. Weissman was accused of acquiring the painting from Glafira Rosales, a dealer on Long Island, and of hiding its provenance, according to court papers.

2011-10-12,Baritone in ‘Don Giovanni’ Taken to Hospital," Mariusz Kwiecien, the Polish baritone who was cast in the title role of the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of “Don Giovanni,” which opens on Thursday night, underwent surgery for a herniated disk on Tuesday, his manager said. “The doctors feel that Mariusz’s prognosis is excellent,” said the manager, William Guerri, of Columbia Artists Management. But it was unclear when he might return to the stage. “It’s a wait-and-see proposition,” Mr. Guerri said. Mr. Kwiecien felt pain during the opening scene of Monday’s dress rehearsal, the manager said. He was taken by paramedics to a hospital, said the Met spokesman, Peter Clark. The Met tapped Peter Mattei, who was on hand for a production of Rossini’s “Barbiere di Siviglia,” to replace Mr. Kwiecien for the opening of “Don Giovanni.” The opera has 16 more performances into March, although Mr. Kwiecien was scheduled to be in the cast only through Nov. 11.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/baritone-in-don-giovanni-taken-to-hospital/

But it’s no joke: one occupational hazard of testing skin-care products is overdosing on irritants. Chemicals can get under your skin, and even natural substances — essential oils, for example — can wreak havoc: lavender’s aroma can be therapeutic and calming, but don’t ply your face with lavender oil. Ditto minty or citrusy oils and anything acidic, unless buried in a gentle formula. Hypoallergenics can also be problematic. Many contain potential endocrine disrupters and other nasty components. Besides, allergies are as varied as fingerprints; there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to irritated skin.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/samurai-shopper-the-wages-of-skin/

The session continued on Tuesday with members of Parliament accusing officials close to President Yoweri Museveni of accepting millions of dollars in bribes.

The document, known as the “Inter Caetera” bull, is well known to scholars but perhaps less so to the general public, which will be able to peruse a fragment online at luxinarcana.org on Wednesday, the day denoting Columbus’s arrival in the Americas in 1492.

2011-10-13,Britain: Ulster Inquiry to Reopen," The British government said Wednesday that it would reopen its investigation into the involvement of British forces in one of the most high-profile killings in Northern Ireland during the 30 years of violence known as the Troubles. But the decision to appoint a prominent British human rights lawyer to prepare a report on the extent of police and army “collusion” in the 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, a lawyer who had represented Irish Republic Army activists, angered his family. They had demanded a full judicial inquiry similar to the one that was completed last year into the “Bloody Sunday” killings of 1972, when British troops shot and killed 13 unarmed Catholic protesters, with another protester dying later of his wounds. The $300 million cost of that inquiry, and the 12 years it took to complete, were cited by the government as reasons for not appointing a similar inquiry in the Finucane case. A previous inquiry had shown that Mr. Finucane was shot 14 times by Protestant gunmen as he ate a meal at his home with his wife and children.

2011-10-13,Britain: First Steps on Change for Women Ascending to Throne," Prime Minister David Cameron has taken the first formal step toward a constitutional change that would allow girls and women to ascend to the British throne before their younger brothers. Mr. Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that he had written to the governments of 15 other Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth as head of state urging their acceptance of a change in the succession rules set by the Act of Settlement, adopted in 1701, which stipulates that male children have precedence over their older sisters in succession to the throne. Mr. Cameron also urged that the law be changed to eliminate a prohibition on the accession of any monarch who is married to a Roman Catholic, calling the ban an “historical anomaly.” The changes are said to have broad support in the other Commonwealth nations, though some are said to have reservations about opening a discussion out of concern that it might reopen potentially acrimonious debate on whether the monarchy should be abolished.

It’s a romantic idea, this ghostly pale lass with wispy blond hair transmuting somehow — perhaps via inspiration from the Muses — her own admittedly tangled emotions into divinely inspired songs to be sung by her divinely bestowed voice. And it’s an idea bolstered by the fact that her first two albums earned her a Mercury Prize nomination each. Marling’s newly released third effort, “A Creature I Don’t Know,” poetically titled like all her albums, trades some of her teenage urgency for a more muscular, acrobatic lyricism — the result being 10 tracks that feel evolved, or more grown-up even.

The first belongs to Butt-Head, the second to Beavis, and in their animated show, which MTV broadcast from 1993 to 1997, that laughter punctuates just about everything the two boneheaded teenagers utter.

The production was first staged over the summer at the Old Vic Theater in London (where Ben Brantley wrote that Mr. Spacey “gives fierce and flashy physical life to every twist of a power-mad man’s corkscrew mind”) and will be the final season of the Bridge Project, a three-year series of collaborations among the academy, the Old Vic and Neal Street, Mr. Mendes’s company.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/spaceys-richard-iii-arrives-in-bams-new-winter-spring-season/

But in Gosling’s hands, these characters seem unknowable and unresolved and volatile.

And since vast shopping opportunities often end in devastating splurges, I arrived to test-shop the store with a plan: 10 items, $200 (which meant that the +J section on the second floor was off-limits). I started at the beginning, the bottom floor, where walls of cashmere V-neck sweaters bragged grand-opening price tags ($89.90 marked down to $49.90). So as not to throw the entirety of my allowance at four candy-colored sweaters, I jumped on the theme-park-style escalators and went straight up to the third floor. It was there that I did a double take: Japanese engineered denim for $9.90! With $190 left, I grabbed a men’s flannel shirt ($29.90), a fluffy down vest ($49.90), a two-for-one Breton-striped lounge set ($24.90) and a pair of very holiday slippers ($12.90; if I don’t wear them, someone in my family will come Christmastime); $72.50 to go and my winter shopping was almost done. Then I turned a corner and found myself staring into an aquarium-like tube filled with the company’s famous (and effective!) Heattech pieces. I chose a knit cap ($12.90) and matching gloves ($12.90), a pack of socks ($9.90) and a camisole ($12.90). I had $23.90 left, enough for a pink umbrella ($12.90). Who knew Uniqlo sold umbrellas?

2011-10-14,Inside the List," CALL 999: Does the road to the White House run through Barnes & Noble? Herman Cain, the long-shot Republican presidential hopeful who took first place in last month’s Florida straw poll, certainly seems to think so. Since “This Is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House” was released on Oct. 4, the former Godfather’s Pizza executive has been spending an awful lot of time in bookstores, signing copies and doing riffs on exclamation-point-happy policy prescriptions like “Natural resources are there for a reason. Use them!”(Anyone else want to hear those guys from the Miller Lite commercials stage a shout-off between Cain’s “Nine, nine, nine!” slogan — a reference to his flat-tax plan — and the Occupy Wall Street movement’s “We are the 99 percent”?) It took Cain about three months and a few professional collaborators to write the rather slender book, but less than one day after official publication to hit the top 10 on Amazon. According to his publisher, Threshold Editions, the book has already gone back for a sixth printing, with some 100,000 copies in circulation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2011-10-14,The Golden Retriever Who Came to Stay,"Let’s be real. It’s hard to keep a straight face writing about puppies. Animal behaviorists like Alexandra Horowitz may apply hard science to shed light on why your shiba inu isn’t interested in the television or your corgi mix likes to eat manure. The good poe­t — John Galsworthy, Rudyard Kipling — will wrest a sigh from the reader’s maudlin breast with paeans to loyal companions long departed. But most dog-crazy writers avoid spilling too much ink on the subject. We’re wary of fashioning sentences that are a prose equivalent of the idiotic high-pitched babble we direct at our animals all day long. (Full family disclosure: my husband routinely cradles our 85-pound Labrador in his arms and sings to her, as he did when she was a puppy, the “Baby Mine” song from “Dumbo.”) If we’re not sentimental, we’ll surely be unoriginal. It’s like writing about sex.

Upon arrival in New York, the French artist, best known for her intensely autobiographical work, proceeded to unpack these items at the Lowell Hotel where she has taken over a suite for “Room,” an installation commissioned by French Institute Alliance Française as part of Crossing the Line, an annual festival of contemporary art. Calle’s inventory also includes a few specialty items she sourced locally, like a burnt mattress, a baby stroller and a Remington Noiseless Portable typewriter.

Its reviews are reminiscent of Barack Obama’s during the 2008 presidential campaign, when one side said he was a socialist Muslim foreigner and the other thought he was a savior from on high. To its detractors, the brain is a kludge, a hacked-up device beset with bugs, biases and self-­deceptions that undermine our decision making and well-being at every turn. To its admirers, it contains vast potential we can all unlock to improve our lives, thanks to “neural plasticity” that enables the adult nervous system to change in more dramatic ways than previously thought. Lately, a growing army of Chicken Littles retorts that this very plasticity has been hijacked by the Internet and other forms of technological crack that are rewiring our brains into a state of continual distraction and intellectual torpor.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/is-the-brain-good-at-what-it-does.html

2011-10-14,Michael Ondaatje’s Passage From Ceylon,"Once, on holiday, a friend and I descended a narrow iron ladder into a floodlit cavern and followed a guide into a small boat. As he rowed us through eerily motionless waters under a low, stalactite-fanged ceiling, the overhead lights went out, and only his flashlight pierced the darkness. In its beam we could see the play of the variegated colors across the crystal-crusted walls, and the slow-moving flickers of eyeless fish, our vision completely dependent on his single beam. Reading Michael Ondaatje’s mesmerizing new novel, “The Cat’s Table,” is like being guided, just as surely and just as magically, through the author’s lustrous visions. As he did in his great 1992 novel, “The English Patient,” which won the Man Booker Prize and became an Academy Award-winning film, Ondaatje conjures images that pull strangers into the vivid rooms of his imagination, their detail illumined by his words.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/the-cats-table-by-michael-ondaatje-book-review.html

Faced with such narrative restrictions, you might be tempted to invent a brother who was everything that Keats was not: practical, rich, footloose, married with a child, healthy enough to reach middle age. Why not send this imaginary brother across the Atlantic to the “rank-grown forests” (as Keats wrote in a later poem) of America, Kentucky, say, and invent encounters with luminous figures like John James Audubon and giant catfish and backwoods swindlers living on “bear sandwiches greased with bear fat”? A lively correspondence between the two brothers, spiced with verses, might serve to delineate the striking differences in their situations, and cast a reciprocal light on the poetry and the prairies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/the-keats-brothers-by-denise-gigante-book-review.html

Weariness with the long struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq has produced a grand opposition alliance of isolationists, realists, populists and left-liberal anti-interventionists, who all agree it is past time to give up the hopeless dream. As Peggy Noonan recently put it, “We should not occupy their lands, run their governments or try to bribe them into bonhomie.” American soldiers should not be “social workers.” When she visited Afghanistan earlier this year, Noonan asked an American general how the war was going and was appalled to hear his answer: “Great.

The year is 1912; a young mother, Blanca Hammer, is fleeing by train with her 4-year-old son, Otto, from some unnamed menace, toward an unknown destination. “It all transpired quickly and with frightening precision,” Appelfeld writes, “as though they were no longer their own masters but in the hands of the railways, which treated them mercifully and moved them from place to place, almost without pain.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/until-the-dawns-light-by-aharon-appelfeld-book-review.html

2011-10-14,The Graphic Novel as Orientalist Mash-Up,"Craig Thompson’s “Habibi” is a work of fantasy about being ashamed of one’s fantasies. This anxiety is native to comics, or at least to the broad strain of American comics written by white males. The work of R. Crumb, for example, is a gallery of self-loathing — portraits that register an artist’s recoil from his own noxious imaginings. Thompson’s work is much prettier than anything drawn by Crumb, but the anxieties are similar. If “Habibi” had been content to mine this narrow but rich vein of adolescent angst it might have been a comic’s comic, or at least an instructive book for young adults. Instead, it aspires to address questions of spirituality, environmental degradation and religious pluralism. The result is frankly a mess, though it does include some arresting pictures.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/books/review/habibi-written-and-illustrated-by-craig-thompson-book-review.html

The owner, Jessica Kelso, was inspired by traditional Scandinavian bathhouses — “löyly” is Finnish for the steam produced when water is poured over sauna rocks — and wanted to bring their sense of accessibility to Stumptown. “I felt like your choices in Oregon were a hippie hot springs experience or really spendy, overly attentive spa experiences, neither of which had ever appealed to me,” she says. The Löyly vibe is one of communal shvitzing rather than solitary pampering. A $15 fee gets you access to an elegantly designed cedar sauna, wet steam room and lounge; though massages and facials are available by appointment, scrubs, salts, masks and foot soaks are do-it-yourself. The place has become as popular with corporate types as it is with the city’s artists, musicians and restaurant servers. “Everyone looks the same wrapped in a white towel,” Kelso says, “although we do see a lot of tattoos in Portland.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/steam-punks/

2011-10-18,Mark McNairy Makes Us Smile (Again),"Gentleman of varying persuasions of style are already familiar with the name Mark McNairy. Shoes from the designer’s footwear collection,  Mark McNairy New Amsterdam, and tailored pieces from the Ivy League-inspired outfitter J. Press, where McNairy was formerly creative director, have made their way into an eclectic mix of closets, from traditional to trendy. When it was announced this summer that McNairy would introduce a complete line of subversive-preppy clothes and accessories for men in the spring, all those fans cheered, and now — it’s official — he’s doing women’s wear, too. Inspired by his daughter, Daisy, the 50-piece collection is charmingly boyish, but (very McNairy) sexily so, with oxford shirts paired with boyfriend boxers and rugby tanks over miniskirts. Echoes of some of the men’s line motifs — a daisy print, an exploded camouflage and a floral-on-plaid shirt — mix easily with more overtly feminine pieces, like the ditsy Laura Ashley-like button-down. “Basically, I make women’s clothes from a guy’s point of view,” McNairy says. “It has nothing to do with fashion — they’re items that transcend trend.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/mark-mcnairy-makes-us-smile-again/

2011-10-19,Frieze Frame | Ken Okiishi’s Manhattan Transfer,"The Frame section of the Frieze Art Fair, curated by Cecilia Alemani and Rodrigo Moura, made space for experimentation on the fair’s fringes in the form of 25 solo artist presentations presented by a younger batch of international galleries. Among them was Alex Zachary, one of New York’s most idiosyncratic galleries both in terms of space and location. (It has been operating out of a multilevel, formerly residential condominium a couple of blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Fittingly, the artist Ken Okiishi’s project at Zachary’s Frame booth was a curious meditation on the psychogeography of Manhattan real estate and mythologies of uptown bohemia. Eulogizing the recently shuttered Lexington Avenue establishment Gino as a point of departure (which over time has hosted luminaries as diverse as Sophia Loren, I. M. Pei and Robin Byrd), Okiishi began by outfitting the booth in the iconic Scalamandré-designed zebra wallpaper that made its debut in the restaurant’s dining room circa 1930. He applied the same print to parasols bolted to the walls, whose slow and steady motorized twirling evoked bygone pageantry and ritziness. Faux-antique photographs of an early-20th-century apartment were hung beside the umbrellas; in actuality these were digital images lifted from the present-day Streeteasy.com listing for a unit on West 67th Street that was once home to Marcel Duchamp, from 1916 to 1918. East Side, West Side, Depression era, recession era: Okiishi’s project drew foggy connections between places and times that are factually disparate but psychically proximate. These artifacts repurposed as ready-mades contribute to a meandering mental map of the city that relies on legends like Duchamp (and Gino’s) as its compass.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/frieze-frame-ken-okiishis-manhattan-transfer/

Now, the French luxury giant Hermès has cleverly succeeded in achieving the very appearance of slowing time with its new watch the Cape Cod Grands Heures, first introduced at Baselworld 2011, and available in stores in time for the holidays. The face of the new watch, which has three choices of distinct dials, shows numeric hour indicators that are clustered together, spread far apart, standing solo and intermittently spaced — all allowing for a variable speed that gives the illusion that time is moving more slowly, or more quickly. Want your afternoons to seemingly pass at a more leisurely pace? Choose a dial with wide open spaces between 2 and 4. Prefer a purportedly longer happy hour? Try the version with larger gaps between 5 and 7. This ingenious trick of time is managed by an oval wheel system that allows for the speeding and slowing of its motion, while the minutes and seconds march steadily, and constantly, on. The clever dial design encourages the romantic notion that time can actually take its time, but the hours, alas, remain the same.

The beauty and aggravation of CMJ is that it’s a plunge into the lower echelons, the ones triaged out of my usual schedule. This is the province of peculiar club layouts, blaringly murky sound systems and disheveled guys in yesterday’s T-shirt poking at their keyboard and mixer, wishing they were Erasure circa 1989.

2011-10-20,TV Chat: Ask the Critics,"This week, the critic Mike Hale took a look at a spate of major cast changes in prime time and came up with a report card on how the shows — “Two and a Half Men,” “CSI,” “The Office,” “Law & Order: SVU” and “House” — are handling the new characters. Only “CSI” got an A, while “Two and a Half Men” received a cringe-worthy D. But the critic Neil Genzlinger says he actually enjoys the Ashton Kutcher version of “Men.” How would you grade the shifts? Then there’s “The X Factor,” which is doing well with the 18-to-49 demographic but not with Mr. Genzlinger, who has some issues.

Mr. Hill, last seen as a statistics nerd in “Moneyball,” is so eager to make “The Sitter” a success — it’s his first film as a solo headliner — that he agreed to an unusual request from Fox’s marketing team. Fox hung posters across the country printed with Mr. Hill’s image, the message “Need a Sitter?” and phone numbers on tear-off tabs, above. About 250,000 people called, and nearly half left messages. Here comes the unusual part: Mr. Hill agreed to carry around the phone belonging to that number and randomly answer calls himself. A Fox spokesman said Mr. Hill had answered a few dozen times. On Wednesday he began returning calls. Mr. Hill, who plays an unprepared baby sitter, also recorded messages for robo-returned calls. “Your voice sounds like a cat that was strangled with a pack of menthols,” one version says in part. “Call me back.” What did Mr. Hill have to say about the gimmick?

2011-10-20,"Afghan Gun Locker: Battlefield Ingenuity, and a Weapon’s Longevity","This year, after Western journalists poured into Libya as the civilian population took up arms and lunged into war, a line of coverage on makeshift arms production and distribution found its way into many newspapers, magazines and Web sites. The New York Times was part of this, with coverage on the anti-Qaddafi forces’ hasty acquisition, production and fielding of all manner of repurposed arms and the vehicles to carry them. Often these weapons were poorly used. Sometimes they were fired just as indiscriminately as the weapons fired by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s troops that NATO, in its United Nations-approved bid to protect civilians, claimed to marshal international will to stop. Some of these weapons were also instrumental in the anti-Qaddafi militias’ eventual success, as was visible in Misurata. (For a fuller view of many of these themes, read this report on the hidden plant in Misurata, or these explainers on the dangerous repurposing of 57-mm air-to-ground rockets or 122-millimeter Grad rockets or, in this case, the knuckleheaded firing of plainly labeled inert rockets toward Qaddafi forces in Libya’s mountainous west.)",World,https://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/afghan-gun-locker-battlefield-ingenuity-and-a-weapons-longevity/

Not that the public would have necessarily protested an Oscar for Rin Tin Tin. “He is a human dog,” one fan wrote to his trainer, “human in the real big sense of the word.” As for Jannings and his colleagues, there may have been some doubt.

2011-10-21,Week 7 Matchups: When the Middling Face the Mediocre,"Colts (0-6) at Saints (4-2)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Saints by 14.The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell — “On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other” — has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league’s carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost.Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline.Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts’ starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week’s game. “I’m envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,” Brees said.

Gray ultimately found his storytelling voice through her directing — another bit of history that is incorrectly characterized. Readers of this article will think “Liz” serves primarily as Gray’s girlfriend, who directs theater on the side. If this were the story of the lover of a male director, we daresay he would not be depicted in this narrative as a foil, mother or handmaiden.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/magazine/reply-all-spalding-gray.html

Failing to distinguish between these two entirely different things is bad medicine, bad policy, simply bad thinking. Obviously, we have lots of work to do. We should be searching for better treatment options, better ways of distinguishing between aggressive and nonlethal cancers, better ways of identifying high-risk patients. But advising men not to be screened accomplishes nothing, except to relieve physicians of their responsibility to inform patients fully and treat them appropriately.

(Twain had long been entranced by her, and had even written a novel called “Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc.”) When she entered the room, the author “had every appearance of a man who had seen a ghost.” When he recovered, Twain said to the assembled guests: “I studied that girl, Joan of Arc, for 12 years, and it never seemed to me that the artists and the writers gave us a true picture of her. They drew a picture of a peasant. . . . But they always missed the face — the divine soul, the pure character.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/books/review/the-maid-by-kimberly-cutter-book-review.html
2011-10-21,Inside the List," VESTED INTERESTS: Last fall, Jonathan Franzen’s glasses were stolen off his face at a London party for his novel “Freedom.” Jeffrey Eugenides may be tempting similar literary vandalism if he doesn’t button up the vest he was recently seen wearing on a big billboard in Times Square advertising “The Marriage Plot,” which hits this week’s hardcover fiction list at No. 2. But at least the vest would be able to send news of its whereabouts, thanks to the Twitter feed @EugenidesVest, which started posting updates from its location “On Jeffrey’s Torso” on Oct. 13. In addition to grumbling about being stiffed by a certain prize committee (“Jeff tells me he’s been having some trouble with the National Book Awards. Something about fiction finalists and the number six.”), the vest seemed none too happy with a rather tart review of “The Marriage Plot” that appeared recently in these pages. “There’s no predicting where William Deresiewicz’s wardrobe will go,” the vest declared. “But I see bikini thongs in his future.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Since the pages of The New York Times Magazine close more than a week before they hit newsstands, we can’t outrun the news. So this week’s interview with the C.E.O. of Netflix, Reed Hastings, provided some rare deadline drama. On Oct. 6, just as we were putting the finishing touches on the interview for the Oct. 16 issue, I got an e-mail from Netflix with the subject line “URGENT.” If the magazine ran the interview with Hastings as planned, The New York Times would look “foolish.” My contact refused to offer me any specifics about what was afoot, but he said I would understand early the following week. He was good on his word. The initial interview — in which Hastings provided his justification for spinning off the disc-only service of his company into Qwikster — would have made us look pretty dopey had we published almost a week after Netflix announced that it was ditching Qwikster altogether. So we quickly put moved up our Melissa McCarthy interview to run in Hastings’s place. Hastings talked to me three days after the Qwikster mercy killing and I drew the entirety of this week’s column from that one interview.

After a two-month, $21 million inspection, staff engineers told the commission at a two-hour briefing that the plant suffered only cosmetic damage. The limited damage led the plant’s operator, Dominion, and the commission to debate whether their standard for measuring a quake’s strength — based simply on ground motion — was the best one. That measure indicated that the ground motion on Aug. 23 exceeded what the reactors were designed for. But when engineers measured the quake by the total amount of energy it delivered, the quake was far too weak to produce significant damage. (The energy measure is based on both the shaking and its duration.) Most of the cosmetic damage found at the plant was limited to concrete, Dominion said.

Instead of the original stars from the film, a different group of actors joined for the occasion. Jennifer Garner played the popular Claire (Molly Ringwald’s part in the movie), James Van Der Beek was Andy the jock (Emilio Estevez), Patton Oswalt was the nerdy Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), Mindy Kaling was the misunderstood Allison (Ally Sheedy), and Aaron Paul was the school-detention lifer Bender (Judd Nelson).  J. K. Simmons and Michael Chiklis were the only two (fictional) adults in the room, portraying Carl the janitor and the hard-line teacher Mr. Vernon. The event was the brainchild of the director Jason Reitman (“Juno,” “Up in the Air”). “I needed a film that was in a contained location with not too many characters, that was funny, that was populous, that had a great script that the audience would have a relationship with,” Mr. Reitman told Entertainment Weekly. He also said he would soon announce five additional readings of different movies to benefit Film Independent, an organization that supports independent film projects and artists.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/movies/a-fresh-reading-of-the-breakfast-club.html

2011-10-24,Domebound,"In 1948, the architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller gathered a group of his students at Black Mountain College to build a life-size geodesic dome. The dome was a flop. It succeeded, however, in planting the seed for the sculptor Kenneth Snelson, a student of Fuller’s, to develop the principle of tensegrity that would allow Fuller to build a dome for the United States Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. For the Performa 11 biennial (11.performa-arts.org), the Los Angeles artist Liz Glynn will retrace Fuller’s steps, pratfalls and all. Part 1 of her performance — a loosely choreographed re-enactment of Fuller’s failed attempt — takes place on the first Sunday of the biennial in locations throughout New York City, including Times Square; for Part 2, 25 volunteers will assist in building a dome. Whether it will stand remains to be seen. But Glynn’s cast-concrete dome sculptures (above), on view at the Performa Hub through Nov. 21, are objects of perfection of which even Fuller might have approved.

2011-10-24,Hidden Gem,"Ten years is the length of an average commercial lease, but it’s also, as the designer Ted Muehling has discovered, the approximate life span of a neighborhood. Back in 2001, Muehling moved his storefront workshop from a formerly desolate block on Greene Street to Howard Street — at the time SoHo’s final frontier. But when a Mondrian hotel went up nearby, so did Muehling’s rent, and the designer moved on once again. His new store, on White Street in TriBeCa, is grander in proportion and there is more selling space, but also more space for Muehling to display the many things he collects and that inspire him, from natural wonders like seashells or insects to the work of his partner, the artist Mats Gustafson, or that of his friend Jan Baracz, who carves bellybuttons into large stones. And while his workrooms are smaller, for the first time Muehling has a little studio all his own — an “attic” tucked into a mezzanine under a skylight in the back. The timing could not have been better. With his product collaborations with Nymphenburg and Steuben winding down, Muehling is eager to get back to making jewelry. On a recent morning, a pair of canaries twittered joyfully, and an installation of monarch butterflies on a dried mullein stem was magically animated by a breeze from the air-conditioner. As with his previous store, this one is livened by sounds from behind the scenes — the bang of metal on metal, the murmur of NPR — evidence that this is a place where things are made and not just sold. It’s the kind of neighborhood place, Muehling points out, where you can walk in and they’ll make a new wire for your earring if you don’t mind waiting 20 minutes.

2011-10-25,Florida: Judge Blocks Welfare Drug Tests,"A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a far-reaching Florida law that requires public assistance applicants to take a drug test, saying the law probably violates a constitutional ban on unreasonable search and seizure. The law, which took effect in July, is the only one in the country that requires people receiving cash assistance through welfare to pass a drug test. The applicants must pay for the test themselves but are reimbursed if they test negative. A similar law in Michigan was struck down as unconstitutional a decade ago. In her ruling, Judge Mary S. Scriven of Federal District Court in Orlando said that there was “no special need” for the state to require drug tests and that it should stop, at least until the court made a final determination in the case. The “court concludes that preliminarily enjoining what appears likely to be deemed an unconstitutional intrusion on the Fourth Amendment rights” of applicants “serves the public interest,” Judge Scriven said. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Luis Lebron, a Navy veteran, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.

The case was closed in 2005, after Ms. Tymoshenko became prime minister.

The four-time Tony Award-winner is set to star in David Adjmi’s new play, “Elective Affinities,” directed by Soho Rep’s artistic director, Sarah Benson. The twist is that the site-specific production will take place in an Upper East Side town house that will hold a maximum of 30 people each evening, with Ms. Caldwell’s character, Alice Hauptmann, playing the role of host. Advance tickets sold out in less than 24 hours. (A limited number of tickets, however, may be made available on the day of each performance.) “I was sent from the Soho Rep a play, a one-woman play, and I said ‘Oh no no,’ ” Ms. Caldwell said in a telephone interview. “I did ‘Lillian’ ” — a 1986 play about Lillian Hellman — “and that almost did me in.” She added, “Then Charlie, my son, said, ‘You could at least read the script before you dismiss it.’ And I said, ‘Fair enough.’ ” Mr. Adjmi, best known as the author of “Stunning,” won a 2010 Whiting Award for playwriting. “I was so stunned by the writing which is marvelously exact,” Ms. Caldwell said of “Elective Affinities,” which was commissioned by the Royal Court Theater and produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005. The producers of the American premiere are Soho Rep, piece by piece productions and Rising Phoenix Repertory.

2011-10-27,‘Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark’,"In addition to her growing dissatisfaction with the run of new movies, Pauline was not particularly happy with her situation at The New Yorker. She continued to do battle with William Shawn over tone and language in her copy, and after more than ten years of the same arguments, she was suffering from battle fatigue. Shawn, for his part, was just as exasperated as he once had been about Pauline’s insistence on using sexual and scatological language that he deemed inappropriate for the magazine. Their arguments had lost none of their sting over the years; as always, Pauline seemed to enjoy pushing Shawn to the limits, trying to find a crack in his gentlemanly decorum. “I can remember a couple of times, at least, seeing him turn so red when they would start arguing,” remembered William Whitworth, who served as Pauline’s immediate editor for a time in the 1970s. “She would never let it go. Shawn had had a heart attack, and I thought a couple of times that he might fall over on the floor right there in the office. She was the only person in the process whodidn’t treat him the way the world of journalism did, and the way the rest of us did, as a very special little person — which he was. She treated him like one of the guys and talked to him that way, with a lot of wisecracks.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/books/review/pauline-kael-a-life-in-the-dark.html

It was July, 2003, just a few weeks after we had moved to Northwest Arkansas from Seattle, and it was the first time I had ever shopped at a Wal-Mart. As we turned the car off of Walton Boulevard — directly across from Wal-Mart’s corporate headquarters — it felt as if our Volkswagen Passat was being swallowed into the vast parking lot of pick-ups and S.U.V.’s the way the tiny rebel spaceship was sucked into Darth Vader’s star destroyer.",Business Day,https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/coming-to-terms-with-wal-mart/

By and large they are not particularly good at the thing we most often ask them to do — imitate us, that is — and yet people (some people anyway) love them precisely for their limitations. Puppetry may even be enjoying one of its periodic revivals right now. “War Horse” is such a hit in large part because of its marvelous lifelike horses, and in “Compulsion” last winter a marionette of Anne Frank was the only character with enough stage presence to stand up to Mandy Patinkin. In our enlightened era some fortunate puppets have been allowed privileges denied to the likes of Howdy, Kukla, Ollie and the rest. Basil Twist, arguably the master of avant-garde puppetry, has incorporated them into a drag show, while in “Avenue Q,” they get to talk filth and have sex.

2011-10-27,36 Hours in Cape Town,"CAPE TOWN overwhelms the senses. Its cultivated side, the bright lights and big buildings of the city center, collides with its geography — the dazzle and danger of the wind-whipped mountains and the two oceans that embrace it. The 2010 World Cup soccer tournament transformed parts of its infrastructure. A 55,000-seat stadium was built. High-end hotels, boutiques, restaurants, art galleries and B&Bs opened. But prices soared, and the tourist trade since then has disappointed. Some businesses have closed; several construction projects remain unfinished. Yet the urban revival continues in the City Bowl (the center), in the area around the University of Cape Town and in the old industrial neighborhood of Woodstock. Despite the grinding poverty in the townships on the city’s outskirts, this is one of the most naturally beautiful places in the world, where adventurers can sky-dive, kite-surf, rock-climb, hang-glide, shark-cage-dive; others can explore with less daring but just as much enthusiasm.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/travel/36-hours-in-cape-town.html

Even more than in the “Shrek” movies, from which this likely candidate for a new animated franchise is spun off, it is a cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting.

The likable Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones play Jacob and Anna, two very un-crazy kids who, after meeting at their Los Angeles college, fall in like and then bed, love and then trouble when Anna, a British citizen, overstays her visa, as Jacob nods his approval. Later, when she tries to return to the United States, the meanies at immigration don’t let her back into the country.

2011-10-28,Roaring at the Screen With Pauline Kael,"In his introduction to “The Age of Movies,” the Library of America anthology canonizing Pauline Kael, Sanford Schwartz writes that she was “undoubtedly the most fervently read American critic of any art” during her two-­decade tenure at The New Yorker. That’s not hyperbole. Such was the power of Kael’s voluminous writing about movies that she transformed the sensibility and standards of mainstream pop culture criticism in America — mostly for the better, despite her bullying personality (in print and in life), her sloppy professional ethics and her at times careerist escapades in self-dramatizing contrarianism. She had a lot to write about. Her prime years as a critic happily coincided with sequential renaissances in foreign cinema (the 1960s) and American movies (the 1970s). Week after week, she whipped up torrents of copy that could make causes célèbres out of even the most ephemeral Hollywood fluff. She upended journalistic criticism the way contemporaneous New Journalists like Tom Wolfe and Hunter Thompson revolutionized reportage. Her essays, fiercely present in the moment and epic in length, buttonholed readers so they’d feel as if they were sitting next to her in the dark, seeing every­thing she saw. She fired up her exultantly vernacular American prose as if she were writing high-octane fiction, not passing judgment on “Cabaret.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/roaring-at-the-screen-with-pauline-kael.html

The regulators of racing have seen the light from the horse and rider perspective. Extensive studies clearly indicate that drugs cause more trouble for racehorses and their riders than they alleviate. Lasix jurisdictions have significantly more breakdowns than jurisdictions where Lasix is not allowed. No prerace Lasix means no attending veterinarians with loaded syringes in the stall injecting the horses with drugs hours before they run.

From one movie to the next she seldom looks the same, and not just in the ones where she has obviously transformed herself. To play the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in “Monster” (2003), for example, she put on 40 pounds, shaved her eyebrows and wore prosthetic teeth.

2011-10-28,New Build | The Tel Aviv Museum of Art,"It isn’t every day that Tel Aviv gets a piece of architecture worth writing home about. In fact, one of the easiest arguments to win in the Middle East might be that Tel Aviv’s urban core has not sprouted a truly remarkable structure in the more than half a century since the Bauhaus inkwell — which left its curvilinear imprint on hundreds of buildings in “The White City” — began to dry up. But with the completion of the Herta and Paul Amir Building at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, opening on Wednesday, things are set to get noticeably whiter and brighter. The new wing, designed by the Cambridge, Mass.-based architect Preston Scott Cohen (who is also chairman of the architecture department at Harvard University), looks a bit like an elongated Rubik’s Cube doused with bleach. The gleaming white parabolas of the facade are composed of 465 flat, interlocking, precast concrete panels of different shapes and sizes. The building’s three floors are linked to two more below grade by an 87-foot-high, top-lit atrium, a “lightfall” that will shine on the world’s largest collection of Israeli art. The building’s confident yet supple geometries provide a nifty counterpoint to the museum’s main building, a 1971 Brutalist number by the Israeli architect Dan Eytan (who also designed Israel’s decidedly unfussy Dimona nuclear reactor). Next to that chunky monkey, Cohen’s creation is pure pizazz. Fittingly, in honor of the building’s inauguration later this month, the city of Tel Aviv has declared 2012 to be Art Year, culminating in a four-day blowout Art Weekend March 21-24.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/new-build-the-tel-aviv-museum-of-art/

2011-10-28,The Joyful Side of Translation,"The theory of translation is very rarely — how to put this? — comical. Its mode is elegy, and severe admonishment. In the 20th century, its great figures were Vladimir Nabokov, in exile from Soviet Russia, attacking libertines like Robert Lowell for their infidelities to the literal sense; or Walter Benjamin, Jewish in a proto-Nazi Berlin, describing the Task of the Translator as an impossible ideal of exegesis. You can never, so runs the elegiac argument, precisely reproduce a line of poetry in another language. Poetry! You can hardly even translate “maman.” . . . And this elegiac argument has its elegiac myth: the Tower of Babel, where the world’s multiplicity of languages is seen as mankind’s punishment — condemned to the howlers, the faux amis, the foreign menu apps. Whereas the ideal linguistic state would be the lost universal language of Eden.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/is-that-a-fish-in-your-ear-translation-and-the-meaning-of-everything-by-david-bellos-book-review.html

She’s a superbly gifted writer, with a touch so light she’s often undervalued. Freud’s seventh novel, “Lucky Break,” which follows a group of actors for nearly 15 years — from their first day at drama school until they’re ready for Botox — may not be her most ambitious, but it’s her most breezily charming and typically shrewd, and comes with a new satirical edge.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/lucky-break-by-esther-freud-book-review.html

2011-10-28,Ambrose Bierce: The Man and His Demons,"The definition of “ghost, n” in Ambrose Bierce’s puckish “Devil’s Dictionary” is “the outward and visible sign of an inward fear,” and although Bierce was not an entirely reliable lexicographer, his authority on this subject is beyond question. He knew more than any man should about both inward fears and their outward and visible signs. And he was at least arguably the most powerful American writer of horror fiction between Poe and Lovecraft. (Henry James’s supernatural tales are in a class by themselves.) In his career Bierce wrote more than 40 spooky stories, most of them about ghosts, along with a fair number of short narratives — some true, some fanciful — about the horrors of war. All his tales, both the ones about soldiers and the ones about the haunted and the haunting, are steeped in loneliness and dread, which he evokes with the precision of someone familiar with their every nuance. A fat new Library of America volume, Ambrose Bierce: The Devil’s Dictionary, Tales, and Memoirs ($35), collects the best of his work, and almost every page has something to give you the chills, though not always, perhaps, in the way the author intended.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/ambrose-bierce-the-man-and-his-demons.html

He does not get a lot of panel time, but one of the creepiest moments comes from Calendar Man, who is housed in Arkham Asylum and does not enjoy the fact that another villain is stealing his motif of date-based crimes.

And whatever grievances the players might have had in the 1990s, they respond well to him when he returns as a guest (with the title music director emeritus).

Luckily, in 1896, the speed limit was raised to 14 miles per hour and cars no longer had to have someone walk ahead of them — the red flag requirement having been eliminated in 1878. In the fall of 1896, motorists celebrated their newfound freedom by driving an “Emancipation Run” from London to the seaside town of Sussex. Today, a re-enactment of the event, now called the Brighton Veteran Car Run, takes place annually with a procession of pre-1905 cars driving from London to Brighton, about 60 miles away, this year from Nov. 4 to 6.

2011-10-31,Creep Show | Sue de Beer’s ‘Haunt Room’,"The New York artist Sue de Beer has long established herself as an aesthetic interlocutor of teens and the occult, so Halloween provides an apt occasion for her to unveil a new work. De Beer’s practice first took root through domestically appointed video installations that channeled deep, dark, suburban, subcultural angst. She has steadily drifted toward explorations of the paranormal, conjuring Puritan New England for her 2007 horror film, “The Quickening,” and more recently — and more minimally — evoking the inherent eeriness of spaces through structures inspired by Brion Gysin’s “Dream Machine” or corporate entities like the Seagram Building. “Haunt Room,” which opened over the weekend on the 14th Street passageway of the High Line, is a 15-foot-wide frosted plexiglass tetradecagon outfitted with powerful infrasound speakers that pump low-frequency tones outside the range of human hearing. According to experiments conducted by Goldsmiths College, these vibrations are capable, in theory, of producing a “haunted” feeling — or at the very least the perception of strange smells and physiological hallucinations like dizziness. Visitors may enter and judge for themselves how easily their sensory perceptions are smeared. “This is a New York ‘haunted house'” de Beer says. “New York City architecture doesn’t have gabled roofs or spooky parlors. It has office buildings, apartment buildings. And the only empty buildings here are either condemned or in the financial district.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/creep-show-sue-de-beers-haunt-room/

Despite their long World Series drought, Stark noted, the Rangers had never inspired the same kind of undying passion as frustrated franchises like the Cubs or Indians or pre-2004 Red Sox: Instead of agonizing over their baseball nine’s inability to win it all, the Dallas-Fort Worth fan base mainly just ignored them.

Had there been a corporate-sponsored jazz festival in New York this summer, he probably would have headlined Carnegie Hall sometime around his birthday, on June 12. Instead he’s taking over the Blue Note for most of November, beginning on Tuesday: two sets a night, in 10 different configurations, with collaborators old and new. It’s the more fitting option by far.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/arts/music/chick-corea-jazz-chameleon-in-all-his-colors.html
