2023-12-05,Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Jonathan Benno Join Forces at Four Twenty Five,"Jean-Georges Vongerichten considers his latest restaurant, a richly appointed installation on two floors in a Park Avenue office tower, as a homecoming of sorts. In 1986, across the avenue at Lafayette in the Drake Hotel, was where New York first noticed him; Bryan Miller awarded Lafayette four stars in The New York Times two years later. Scores of restaurants and decades later, at Four Twenty Five, Mr. Vongerichten is relying on a seasoned veteran, Jonathan Benno, who was the chef de cuisine at Thomas Keller’s Per Se and the executive chef at Lincoln Ristorante before having his own place in NoMad. The menu in the new restaurant is à la carte and seasonal. January, not July, comes to mind with Nantucket bay scallop tartare; tricolor cauliflower; chicory salad with walnuts and pears; winter squash agnolotti with brown butter vinaigrette; a main dish of celery root done francese-style; pan-roasted steelhead trout with pumpkin seed gremolata and roasted squash; chicken breast cloaked in black truffle crumbs and served with black truffle butter; and charred duck breast with roasted cabbage. There’s also a seven-course tasting. Some dishes, notably the pastas and crudos, announce Mr. Benno, while others, like steamed black sea bass with winter mushrooms, are clearly from Mr. Vongerichten’s portfolio. “Black sea bass is the best fish in America,” he said. The 84-seat restaurant, designed by Norman Foster (like the building that houses it), is on the second floor, softly done in tones of gray and burgundy, with a gleaming kitchen behind a wall of glass, and a soaring ceiling. There’s a bar on the ground floor, with a vibrant Larry Poons painting above it, where small plates like sliders and chicken samosas will be served. Through the end of the year it will be dinner only, with lunch to follow next month, and eventually breakfast.

2023-12-06,How Artists Are Breaking the Taboos Around Depicting Birth,"Not long after completing “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), her monumental installation dedicated to historical women, the artist Judy Chicago began researching depictions of birth in Western art — only to discover there were almost none. “If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning,” she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth — the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room — and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, “The Birth Project” series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicago’s retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, “building a form language almost ‘from scratch,’” one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the show’s curators, the series has never been shown in full.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/t-magazine/birth-art-labor-mothers.html

The resolution in the last three stanzas gestures at Jordan’s attempt to learn from others. The poet and reader embrace on the page.

At its core, it concerns an intellectual argument about history and hierarchies of power, but it’s also about the fraught process of making this argument. It’s a daunting conceit that DuVernay has shaped into an eventful narrative that is, by turns, specific and far-ranging, diagnostic and aspirational. It is a great big swing about taking a great big swing, and while the film is more persuasive as a drama than the argument it relays, few American movies this year reach so high so boldly.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/movies/origin-review-ava-duvernay.html

2023-12-11,No Ortolans Were Hurt During the Making of This Film,"“The Taste of Things,” a French food film, will be shown in theaters this week in order to qualify for the Oscars and to make you really, really hungry. The 145-minute film by Tran An Hung, starring Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel, is based on the 1920 novel “The Life and Passion of Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet” by Marcel Rouff, inspired by the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, who gave his name to a cheese and a cake. The film is set at a modest château in the Loire region, the centerpiece of which is the robust kitchen where Dodin-Bouffant and his cook, Eugénie, prepare sumptuous meal after meal for Dodin’s small coterie of gourmands, as their own love story gently simmers. The pièce de résistance is a classic pot-au-feu. The chef Pierre Gagnaire was the consultant for the cooking, and in an interview in New York he said “everything is real; there was no faking.” (Not quite: There was backup gas fuel for the wood-burning stove, and small quail stood in for ortolans, a delicacy that is illegal.) He said the stars knew how to cook and “jumped right in.” Ms. Binoche told me that the food “haute cuisine but not pretentious.”  From Dec. 13 through 20, there will be a menu at Frenchette, in TriBeCa, with three dishes from “The Taste of Things”: a ballotine of duck, pot-au-feu and baked Alaska ($90 or à la carte).

A collection of real bags on the floor before her doubled the optical illusion for passers-by, who might have been carrying their own bags from the nearby Versace or Dolce & Gabbana stores. But the gallery, Sprüth Magers, is not the kind of place where most people can casually drop in and buy something; the artworks sold there fetch prices in the tens to the hundreds of thousands. If Fleury’s work poked fun at the view that art is just a commodity, it was also a nostalgic reflection on the moment the empty shopping bags were first shown by the gallery, in 1991 — a time when neither she nor her dealers could have afforded a permanent storefront in Mayfair.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/t-magazine/spruth-magers-gallery.html

2023-12-12,The Original Café Boulud Moves South,"What a difference a few blocks can make. The original Café Boulud, an Upper East Side neighborhood hangout and destination since 1998, has moved south about half a mile to an area where its customers are likely to be driven more by destination. It’s now installed in a somewhat grander setting near the Plaza Hotel and amid a coterie of other French restaurants. Still, those who know and love the restaurant will recognize the menu; it’s divided in quadrants addressing Le Voyage, La Saisons, Potager and La Tradition, with seasonal updates for each. Right now expect to be tempted by short ribs, crabmeat, mushrooms, sunchokes and desserts sparkling with citrus. The executive chef is Romain Paumier, who worked at the original Café Boulud and was the executive sous chef at Mr. Boulud’s flagship, Daniel. He’s the latest in a kitchen that, over the years, has been an incubator for names like Andrew Carmellini, Gavin Kaysen and Aaron Bludorn. Katalina Diaz, formerly the executive sous chef for pastry at Daniel, is the executive pastry chef. Of all his restaurants, this is the one to which Mr. Boulud is most deeply attached, given that his great-grandparents opened a Café Boulud 100 years ago near Lyon, France, his hometown. The new Café Boulud, designed by Jeffrey Beers, moves into the space that previously housed Vaucluse and before that Park Avenue Cafe, Périgord Park and Voisin. Now with pale gray walls that echo the color of the recently redone Daniel nearby, the new Café Boulud has artwork, traditional detailing, velvet and leather seating in deep teal blue and amber; the space beckons with airy comfort, as yet another reaffirmation that fine dining is sticking around. There are a number of other spaces, including a bar that will open in February, and a series of elegant salons opening in the spring that will be the New York headquarters for Maison Barnes, an international realty company based in Paris, and Mr. Boulud’s new partner.

Yet each store requires dozens and often hundreds of people to run — to fill the shelves, take inventory, organize displays of canned beans or help a customer locate the vanilla extract. In the latest episode of On the Job, we spent the day with Amy O’Rourke at Stew Leonard’s — a grocery chain in the Northeast that goes out of its way to engage and entertain shoppers. Her goal as assistant seafood manager is not only to ensure that customers can find the freshest clams, shrimp and salmon, but also to make a job that can feel invisible, visible. She accomplishes that with an abundance of energy, an uncannily outgoing personality and occasionally, a lobster suit.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/dining/stew-leonards-seafood-counter.html

There’s a bonus column, which apparently enables the extravagant stairstep of eight eight-letter entries through the middle of the puzzle (according to its constructor notes, below). I also noted the scarcity of “glue” here — less nondescript fill makes a puzzle more interesting but often a lot tougher, especially if you’re not quite on the right wavelength.

In a show of extreme confidence, it’s the only product sold in the bright white shop of the same name he owns with Edward Geyman, his business partner. A native of the Burgundy region in France who studied pastry-making and has been a pastry consultant in many countries around the globe, Mr. Doyen, 38, arrived in the United States a year ago and began working on this project. “I didn’t just want to reproduce French pastry,” he said. The flavor and filling combinations are endless. For now he has eight colorful examples, including peanut butter and jelly, matcha with white chocolate, walnut with dark chocolate, red velvet with dark chocolate and raspberry, and pecan caramel with milk chocolate chips and sea salt. He has a featured flavor of the month, which for now is s’mores with a marshmallow topping that he torches before serving.

And over the past year and a half, she’s done just that, cultivating relationships with an array of craftspeople who now supply Stissing House with products including hand-woven willow breadbaskets, tapered beeswax candles and scented botanical soaps. “These objects have become part of the DNA of what we do,” said de Boer recently, adding that the restaurant’s newsletter has evolved into a sort of monthly ode to the region’s makers.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/t-magazine/stissing-house-holiday-market.html

The film’s most thorough violation, though, is of its cinematic bloodline: To call “Rebel Moon” a “Star Wars” pastiche — with a dash of “Dune,” a lick of “Lord of the Rings” and a whole heap of “Seven Samurai”— is both glaringly accurate and somewhat redundant.

2023-12-21,‘Anyone but You’ Review: Baring Bums in the Land Down Under,"The floundering romantic comedy “Anyone but You” has several things going for it: the rising stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, a luxurious Australian backdrop, and more white teeth and washboard abs than the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. The plot is a classic switchback prank. Sworn enemies Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) pretend to fall in love at a destination wedding so that their friends and family (Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, Bryan Brown, Michelle Hurd and GaTa) will quit trying to trick them into liking each other. It’s a loose reworking of “Much Ado About Nothing,” and, presumably, the first Shakespeare adaptation where a dog does yoga — and certainly the first in which a man (GaTa) serenades a koala. Nevertheless, the film, directed by Will Gluck, who wrote the screenplay with Ilana Wolpert, is so awkwardly assembled that our attention gets pulled away from the leads to the bizarrely lavish buffet spreads in the background. We’re mildly curious about whether these two fakers will slip between the sheets for real — and majorly interested in why a guest bedroom has so many bowls of fruit.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/movies/anyone-but-you-review.html

2023-12-22,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,"This thoughtful release is the latest in a long — and ever-growing — line of science-fiction movies considering whether or not artificial intelligence can develop self-awareness and feelings. Directed by a filmmaking duo calling itself hazart, “A Hard Problem” looks at what it means to be alive — which, naturally, also involves what it means to cease to exist. Ian (Johnny Berchtold), after the death of his mother, Mary (Jennifer Pierce Mathus), is left to sort her belongings. The willowy young man is adrift and forlorn, which seems like a legitimate response, but actually isn’t: He’s a synthetic “artificial parallel” of the actual Ian, who died of cancer, and was created to assuage Mary’s grief. Logically, Ian should be taken out of commission since his purpose is gone. But gradually both he and Olivia (Catherine Haena Kim), a representative of the company that built him, realize that shutting down a parallel is more fraught than turning off an appliance. Considering that people now clone their pets, the issues raised in this elegantly directed, acted and designed (far from a given among modestly budgeted indies) movie are a breath away from coming true.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/movies/five-science-fiction-movies-to-stream-now.html
