If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach.

2018-11-01,"Review: ‘Marfa Girl 2,’ Larry Clark’s Sequel to One of His Least-Known Films","It’s been some years since Larry Clark’s days as one of American cinema’s foremost provocateurs, a pioneering photographer who took his fascination with dead-end lives, drug use, and adolescent sexuality and channeled it into controversial, acclaimed films such as “Kids” (1995) and “Bully” (2001). And although it’s loaded with sex, the most brazen thing about “Marfa Girl 2” might be that it presupposes some knowledge of “Marfa Girl,” which played the Rome Film Festival in 2012, received limited theatrical distribution in 2015 and made little impact with critics or audiences.

2018-11-02,How a Grandmother’s Diary Led to a Long-Lost Literary Gem,"I first came across the name “Gilgi” on a page of my grandmother Käthe’s diary from 1932, tucked between mentions of “Shanghai Express” with Marlene Dietrich and a performance by the Jewish cabaret star Dela Lipinskaja. “Such courage!” Käthe wrote, of the character Gilgi. I was curious for any glimpse into my grandmother’s mind during this chapter of her life when she was an expressionist dancer in Hamburg and sported boyish haircuts and berets. She had recently fallen in love with my grandfather Hermann and was summoning the courage to divorce her husband. From Wikipedia I learned that “Gilgi” was the first novel by a writer named Irmgard Keun (1905-82), who had been the It Girl of the German literary scene in the final years of the Weimar Republic. Intrigued, I ordered a copy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/irmgard-keun-gilgi.html

Reacher has made his way to his father’s birthplace in Laconia, N.H., where he finds the remains of his family home in the rubble of Ryantown, a settlement that grew up around a tin mill that turned out to be an ecological disaster. At its peak, Reacher discovers, the mill “seemed to be universally accepted as a horrific tableau of clouds of smoke and raging fires and boiling metals, like a miniature hell.” Intrigued, he sticks around to learn more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/past-tense-lee-child.html
2018-11-02,How Do You Talk to Children About Politics These Days? Try These Books.,"It’s a question parents have wrestled with since the 2016 presidential election: How do we explain this political moment to our children? I, for one, was hoping the answer would not involve a book aimed at teenagers in which a candidate’s obscene reference to female anatomy appears on Page 2, but that is where we are. In UNPRESIDENTED: A Biography of Donald Trump (Feiwel and Friends, 384 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), Martha Brockenbrough provides an encyclopedic tale of the rise of Donald J. Trump. Brockenbrough’s version is, unapologetically, a liberal’s framing of events. Then again, I’m not sure if a nonpartisan book about Trump could grow out of the current climate. For now, there is this thorough, hard-hitting volume that seeks to explain Trump, from the time he was born with a silver spoon and “golden hair, pink cheeks and a tiny pucker of a mouth,” to his shocker of a presidential campaign (“candidates typically don’t insult the parents of soldiers who die in combat”).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/unpresidented-martha-brockenbrough.html

Mr. Rainbow found his way to fame, however, once Donald Trump ran for president. This is when the actor and singer, now 36, transformed his quirky online performances, which he’d been doing for years, into political parodies. One of his first, “Braggadocious!” — reminiscent of “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” from Mary Poppins — garnered 28 million views over 48 hours. More recently, “Kavanaugh!” (which sounds a lot like “Camelot”) was viewed 2.5 million times. Mr. Rainbow writes, styles, records and edits his videos himself. They usually combine show tunes or Top-40 songs with highly doctored cable news interviews, in which he appears as a guest anchor, wearing his signature pink cat-eye reading glasses. Currently, he is on tour with his one-man show, “Randy Rainbow Live.” When he’s in town, he lives with his Persian cat, Mushi, in his two-bedroom walk-up in Astoria, Queens.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/nyregion/how-randy-rainbow-singing-political-satirist-spends-his-sundays.html

Yet for its residents Montreal’s charisma never dims, and with its affordable rents and thriving food scene — where a $10 gravy-soaked poutine from La Banquise and the foie gras at the gourmand-beloved institution Joe Beef command equal respect — it’s not hard to see why the city is home to so many writers, artists and musicians.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/t-magazine/montreal-travel-guide.html

2018-11-05,How a Group of Gay Male Ballet Dancers Is Rethinking Masculinity,"When I was 15, I met a dancer from Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet. The company had come to Los Angeles to dance in the Olympic Arts Festival, and my parents volunteered to host a post-performance dinner in our backyard. I recall about 200 people — family friends, Olympic officials and maybe 25 dancers — eating curry (is that right?) off paper plates. But that’s not what this is about. No, this is about the ballerino — my word for him — I met and what he represented to a lonely gay kid in Southern California in 1984, a kid who had never before met another gay person. Earlier that evening, I had seen the dancer turn, leap and smile onstage, expressing through the mute language of ballet who he was. Something about his movement told me he was gay, and I felt he was dancing not only for himself but for me. Onstage, the ballerino wore brown tights that showed the trunks of his thighs, and everything else. Now he was in loose linen pants with a drawstring belt and an open collar that exposed the rod of his clavicle.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/t-magazine/gay-male-ballet-dancers.html

A few years ago, when Roman and Williams were asked to redo the British galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she saw the plates again and began collecting. Today, Standefer has amassed 20 of the jewel-tone platters, with their sea-creature embellishments and contoured divots (you shuck the bivalves and slide them onto the plate, shell-less). Recently, she has put a few up for sale at the Guild, a retail outpost she and Alesch opened last year in SoHo. “They’re magical,” she says, “and tell a story of the world at a certain time.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/t-magazine/robin-standefer-roman-williams-oyster-plate-collection.html

Under other circumstances, we would split everything equally among our children, but for our addicted son, this would be like throwing gasoline on a fire. Even the process of distributing family treasures is fraught, knowing our son would head straight to a pawnshop. We are thinking of putting his share into a trust to be used exclusively for his future health needs, rehab and, hopefully, sobriety.

I was hired on the spot and given two specific jobs to do each day: make 100 chocolate cookies and bake a few chocolate cakes with whiskey and raisins. As both of the house specialties were similar to recipes I’d made at home, all went well. And then, one day, I had what I thought was a good idea. Without telling anyone, I made the cake with a few changes: I substituted Armagnac for the whiskey, pecans for the almonds, and prunes, not everyone’s favorite fruit, for the raisins.

That cognitive dissonance, along with Narcissister’s grab bag of props, prosthetics and costumes, which she layers on as if she were a Russian doll, lends her dance pieces a sinister air.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/movies/narcissister-organ-player-review.html

Ashton Kutcher as a Bollywood producer, Raj, in a 2012 commercial, his skin darkened, a brown mustache affixed to his face, speaking in a cheap singsong voice, swaying his body, which is clad in a bright blue silk sherwani, back and forth to imitate the Indian head waggle. Tilda Swinton, otherworldly in her beauty, as always, but monkishly bald as the Ancient One, a character originally intended to be Tibetan, in 2016’s “Doctor Strange.” More subtle, but still just as shocking: Emma Stone — blonde and green-eyed — as Allison Ng, leaning against a kitchen island in a scene from 2015’s “Aloha” and saying, “My dad was half Chinese, half Hawaiian,” as breezily as if she were saying goodbye to someone on the telephone.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/t-magazine/asian-american-actors-representation.html

So the Central Saint Martins graduate took one of the paintings she had been working on in her spare time — a set of antlers rendered in watery ink, from a series about headpieces from crowns to coxcombs — and digitally printed it onto a roll of paper in close repeats.

Finally is the operative term here as the chef, who cooked at Per Se and Lincoln Ristorante, said he has been waiting about 30 years to open his own restaurant, spending the past five or so years on this project. The dining room, at the back of the hotel — past his Leonelli Focacceria e Pasticceria and the informal Leonelli Taberna — is fairly intimate, with 45 seats and another 10 at the bar. The décor suggests Art Deco and Modernist design, and includes original walnut woodwork, restored mosaic floors and a dramatic light fixture that hangs from a central skylight. Mr. Benno has tapped his French and Italian training and experience for a Mediterranean menu with a focus on Liguria, in Northern Italy, and Provence, in Southern France. There’s a risotto with squash and chestnuts; skate almondine; olive oil-poached steelhead trout; a terrine of sweetbreads, rabbit and foie gras; and short ribs niçoise-style. Pastas include spaghetti made with burnt wheat (grano arso) and dressed with seafood, lumache with lobster fra diavolo, and classic agnolotti del plin with duck and foie gras. “I could not resist doing the pastas,” Mr. Benno said. The pastry chef, Lindsey Bittner, also taps into Mediterranean fare with a rosemary flan, chocolate babka with pistachio halvah, and pears with goat cheese.

A slack mouth forces your body into a sleepy limpness and allows you to take tiny, imperceptible breaths. To be convincing, you must not visibly breathe, swallow, blink or let your eyes or body convey any of the twitchy, lit-from-within traits of the living.

He knew enough about the topic that these psychologists and neuroscientists and physicians and anthropologists and philosophers had come to his city to talk about — the placebo effect, the phenomenon whereby suffering people get better from treatments that have no discernible reason to work — to call it “fake medicine,” and to add that it probably works because “people like to be cheated.” He took a beat. “But in the end, I believe that honesty will prevail.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html

Drawn to the island’s abundance of salt and its enclosed natural harbor, Schottegat, they settled on Curaçao in the mid-17th century and led the West African slave trade from its capital port city of Willemstad. Following the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, Curaçao fell into ruin but was later revived, in the 20th century, during a boom in Venezuela’s oil trade; in 2010, the country was granted autonomy by the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/t-magazine/curacao-travel-guide.html

2018-11-09,How Does a Museum Buy an Artwork That Doesn’t Physically Exist?,"THE ARTIST TINO SEHGAL believes there are enough objects in the world. His art involves people, not things, and the process of selling it is entirely verbal. Sehgal does not issue receipts. He does not permit his work to be photographed or filmed, nor does he produce catalogs or even wall labels to accompany his exhibitions. In fact, he eschews all forms of documentation, written or otherwise, in relation to the sale, presentation and care of his work. His pieces, which he calls “constructed situations,” usually involve “players” or “participants” who have been trained by the artist to enact specific actions. At the 2005 Venice Biennale, in a piece titled “This Is So Contemporary,” participants dressed as security guards leapt around visitors to the German Pavilion chanting, “Ooh, this is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!” before resuming nonchalant poses. For a 2010 show at the Guggenheim Museum called “This Progress,” a series of increasingly older interpreters guided visitors up the museum’s spiraled rotunda while carrying on free-form conversations that began with the visitor’s personal definition of progress. His most famous work, “Kiss,” from 2002, involves a man and a woman recreating iconic embraces from artworks throughout history, inspired by oeuvres as distinct as those of Auguste Rodin and Jeff Koons, on the floor of an exhibition space.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/t-magazine/tino-sehgal-hirshhorn-museum-art.html

On Nov. 11, 2018, that peace agreement will be 100 years old. To commemorate the anniversary, we asked readers to share stories and memories of their relatives who had a role in World War I. We received hundreds of submissions, many of which went beyond the traditional definition of a war story; among the tales of loss, death and trauma were also stories of love, mischief and unexpected happiness. Countless families were forged during and after the war: young men and women, who may not have ever met otherwise, brought together under circumstances tied to their service. Other readers wrote of relatives who joined the military to earn their citizenship after immigrating to the United States. Sometimes even without understanding a word of English, these men put on a uniform and fought for a country they wanted to call home.

All animals have lessons for us, but none have as much to show fledgling humans — and some of us older ones — about finding and losing, playing and working, caring and staying true.

2018-11-12,Great New Children’s Books About Animals,"So much of early childhood is about animals.

Their picture books feature peace-loving bulls, cookie-loving mice and oversize red dogs who make excellent stand-ins for little humans. But the middle-grade years — when kids’ passions are still more fixed on kittens and horses than the opposite sex — are the real sweet spot for animal books. This is when we get animal protagonists with inner lives as complicated as a 10-year-old’s (“Charlotte’s Web”) and tender stories about kids whose beloved pets help them grow and mature (I call them bildogsromans), like Kate DiCamillo’s “Because of Winn-Dixie.” There’s also the recurring theme of an animal rescued by a resourceful child — what could feel more empowering to a 10-year-old than saving a life? Four new novels provide their own twists on these classic story lines and prove, once again, that tales about animals can help kids understand the world and themselves.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/books/review/patricia-maclachlan-my-fathers-words.html

Kaz Fujimura is responsible for pastries, and Andrea Morris is in charge of drinks and wine. A circular bar and lounge is on one side of the second floor.

2018-11-14,A Letter to the Army: Don’t Punish the Man Who Led the Mission That Killed My Son,"After multiple investigations into the ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead last year, the United States Army punished several people who were involved in the mission, including the two soldiers who led the 11-man team when militants attacked it. Those punished were not reprimanded for what happened during the ambush but rather what led up to it, including poor training alongside Nigerien troops, a lack of pre-mission rehearsals and what investigators called a misleading mission plan. The leader of the Special Forces team, Capt. Mike Perozeni, along with his second in command, received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand, known as a GOMOR. A reprimand’s impact is based on where it is placed in a soldier’s file. If the letter is considered “local,” it will disappear after the soldier changes jobs. If it is permanent, it likely means the end of a career. The soldier, and others on his behalf, can write a rebuttal. Below is a letter written on behalf of Captain Perozeni by Henry Black, the father of Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, one of the four soldiers killed in the ambush. A version of this letter was delivered to Maj. Gen. Edwin J. Deedrick Jr., the commanding officer of the First Special Forces Command, who administered the letters.

Set in the early 20th century, it follows five literate juvenile delinquents (all boys, but played by women), who rape and kill their English teacher and are sent to sea as punishment. There, a hard-driving Dutch sea captain tortures them with work and tantalizes them with his manliness, at one point even displaying his tattooed penis. Things get really delirious when he brings the boys to an island rich with twisted, mysterious sights: Tree branches shoot milky white fluids; furry flora shaped like women’s legs opens up to receive them.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/movies/the-wild-boys-review.html

Soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol, each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system, a tracked robot armed with a machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats, like people or vehicles.

The Russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack. In less than a second, both the Estonian and Russian robots, commanded by algorithms, turn their weapons on the human targets and fire. When the shooting stops, a dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines, leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage — or blame the other side for the attack.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/magazine/autonomous-robots-weapons.html

Seeing them connect so strongly with this nuanced, absorbing novel made me wonder why boys at this age — the “chapter book” years, when they’re reading on their own, but not full-on novels — are pushed mostly toward shallow books full of battles, boogers and pranks.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/books/review/beyond-gender-stereotypes-boys.html

The pileup of digitized music since the emergence of the MP3 has prompted a retreat, however niche and ultimately minor, into the world of vinyl records and even tapes. The ransacking of the physical texture of the world — books, newspapers, retail stores, maps — has been so enormous and sudden that it becomes possible to see what we are losing and no longer regard the onrushing future as progress.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/t-magazine/japanese-paper-washi.html

2018-11-19,Two Pioneering Artists Discuss Motherhood and Machismo,"The artists Phyllida Barlow and Anna Maria Maiolino grew up continents apart, but they share a language of mud and cement, life cycles and rebirths. Barlow, 74, is a British artist renowned for her often-soaring sculptures cobbled together from industrial refuse, as though an ordinary urban street had suddenly come alive and risen up into a sentient colossus. Maiolino, 76, is an Italian, São Paulo-based artist celebrated for her modeled- and rolled-clay installations and sculptures that suggest the work of “a housewife gone mad,” as the curator Helen Molesworth once put it, and evoke everything from human organs, phalluses and rolls of bread to prehistoric worms. Barlow had a traditional arts education at London’s Chelsea College of Arts, followed by the Slade. Maiolino had a very nontraditional upbringing and education, migrating with her family from Italy to Venezuela during World War II, and then from Venezuela to Brazil, where her performances, videos and works on paper contributed, alongside work by Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, to the Neo-Concrete and New Objectivity movements at a time of political upheaval in Brazil. (She audited classes at an art school in Rio de Janeiro but considers herself largely self-taught.) Both artists are mothers, and both received full recognition for their pioneering work late in life — and continue to make work in their 70s as a matter of some urgency. This month, their artworks are on view in concurrent solo exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth in New York, where we met on a brisk fall morning. There, the two artists sat down together to talk about their work and lives for the first time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/t-magazine/phyllida-barlow-anna-maria-maiolino-conversation-art.html

2018-11-20,"Rufus Wainwright and Ivo van Hove Talk Politics, Coming Out and Boarding School","What does the Belgian dramatist Ivo van Hove have in common with the American-Canadian singer Rufus Wainwright? For one, they’re both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the ’70s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 “Want” albums. Then he decided to write operas — the second, “Hadrian,” with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October — and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson’s 2009 staging of Shakespeare’s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose “The Crucible” and “A View From the Bridge” he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered “A Little Life,” adapted from the novel written by T’s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet’s prescient 1976 media satire, “Network” (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, “Sword of Damocles,” as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self — and the benefits of boarding school.

2018-11-21,Yorgos Lanthimos’s Polarizing Visions,"This June, the Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos traveled to Ingmar Bergman’s former residence on Faro, a remote Swedish island dotted with dairy farms and ancient limestone pillars and a dwindling population of 500 full-time residents who speak a dialect of their own. He had been invited to give a talk during Bergman Week, an annual festival at which fans attend lectures and screenings and go on “Bergman Safaris,” driving on one-lane roads to the pebbly coasts and placid cabins where many of the Swedish director’s films were made. Lanthimos explored the Bergman residence with its clean lines and windows opening directly onto the Baltic Sea, examining notes in the director’s own handwriting scrawled directly upon the furniture (“I’m successful at my career, and I’m still sleepless”). He saw an original print of “Persona” in the 15-seat private theater, where Bergman’s ample leather recliner is always left empty in the front of the room, and even viewed a segment from one of his own works (“Dogtooth,” his second film), something he hardly ever does. While editing, he watches each film over and over, so by the time it’s ready to be shown, he “can’t wait until it’s the last time, for at least 10, 15 years.” His reaction was similar to the one he’d once had while rewatching “Kinetta,” his first movie: “Strange, strange, but not so bad, really.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/magazine/yorgos-lanthimoss-director-favourite.html

2018-11-22,36 Hours in Rome,"For all its imperial and papal pomp and circumstance, Rome at heart is a beautiful child — raucous, dreamy, secretive, a touch spoiled, by turns exasperating and enchanting.

Today’s Rome is a paradoxical place: even as many historic neighborhoods fall to mass-touristic homogeneity, outlying districts are becoming more vibrant and varied. For an authentic Roman holiday, get out of the centro storico and sample the pizza stalls of the Testaccio market and the funky wares at the nearby Porta Portese Sunday flea market, the nightclubs of San Lorenzo and Tiburtina, and neighborhood gelaterie like Neve di Latte and La Mucca Bianca. Tranquillity has never been Rome’s strong suit, but with a bit of planning (and flexibility), the Eternal City can be at its most bewitching at the onset of winter. (Though buses and trams crisscross the city, you’ll save time with two easy-to-navigate taxi apps — My Taxi and It Taxi.)",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/travel/what-to-do-in-rome-36-hours.html

He was also a documentarian of the quieter moments in life — two lovers sharing a simple kiss, a flower shot to resemble the human form — all of which will be on display in “Implicit Tensions: Mapplethorpe Now,” a wide-ranging, yearlong show of his work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, beginning Jan. 25, 2019. In his photographs, you learn as much about the artist — whose death, at the age of 42 in 1989, was due to complications from AIDS — as you do his subjects. “The whole point of being an artist or making a statement is to learn about yourself,” he once said. “The photographs, I think, are less important than the life that one is leading.” We asked three writers to create short fictions based on three of his most iconic images.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/t-magazine/robert-mappelthorpe-michael-cunningham-elif-batuman-hilton-als.html
2018-11-23,Three Woolly Creatures Beloved by an Italian Fashion Brand,"In the mid-1980s, Pier Luigi Loro Piana, then co-president of his family’s eponymous fashion company, trekked to the frigid plateau of Inner Mongolia to visit the rarefied Capra hircus goats that produce the cashmere for the line’s clothing and accessories (Loro Piana also uses fibers from South American vicuñas and merino sheep in New Zealand and Australia). As he surveyed the herd, an idea struck: “Human baby hair is infinitely softer than an adult’s. The same is probably true of baby goats.” Thus was born baby cashmere, made from the almost-weightless inner coat of the kid, available only once in each animal’s lifetime, when they are between 3 and 8 months old. Each produces a mere single ounce of strands that average only 13.5 microns (or about 0.0005 inches) in diameter; it takes 19 ounces to make a single sweater. “Holding one of these small creatures in my arms, I had the same emotion as when I hold a baby,” Loro Piana says. “It’s a symbol of purity.” Here is the small collection of species that Loro Piana uses to create most of its textiles.

2018-11-27,The American Spirit of Coach’s Stuart Vevers,"Coach’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, first started paying attention to clothes at the Manchester and Leeds nightclubs he visited as a teenager. “Before that, I was a kid from a working-class family in Northern England who didn’t know the fashion industry even existed,” he says. “Then all of a sudden, I was obsessively dressing in paisley shirts and vintage velvet blazers and customizing my jeans.” At 18, he left his home in Cumbria to study fashion at London’s University of Westminster, graduating with an assistant job at Calvin Klein in New York (“I showed up at the interviewer’s hotel unannounced and begged her to look at my portfolio”). He returned to Europe two years later, eventually landing as the head of accessories at Givenchy and then at Louis Vuitton, where Marc Jacobs was his mentor. With the launches of Givenchy’s pumpkin bags and the multicolor monograms Takashi Murakami collaborated on with Louis Vuitton, Vevers became synonymous with the early 2000s It-bag phenomenon and was hired to reinvigorate Mulberry in 2004, followed by Loewe in 2007. Those roles made him an obvious choice for Coach, the American heritage brand that got its start in 1941 producing billfolds and briefcases inspired by baseball gloves. “Although I use our history as a jumping-off point, I felt we needed to radically catapult forward,” says Vevers, 45. “On day one, I decided to think beyond just accessories.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/t-magazine/stuart-vevers-coach-inspiration.html

2018-11-27,Taiwanese Fried Chicken and Bubble Tea Head to the Flatiron District,"This new eat-in, take-out spot is a Taiwanese doubleheader. Kung Fu Tea, a Taiwanese-style bubble tea company that started in 2010 in Flushing, Queens, and now has 200 outlets in 30 states, has joined forces with TKK Fried Chicken, a chain founded in 1974 in Taiwan. The Taiwanese recipe called “original” on the menu is crisp and moderately spiced. There is also a milder version and, for the American market, a crisper, more forcefully seasoned one. How is this fried chicken different from the Korean variety found all over New York? “Taiwanese fried chicken is first marinated for 24 hours to add flavor,” said Steven Luw, the general operating manager. “Then it gets a flour breading and is fried once. Korean fried chicken is usually dipped in batter and fried twice.” The company, which will count this location as its first American restaurant in addition to the 68 branches it has in Taiwan and Shanghai, is also offering items that are not on the menu in Asia, including curly fries, a fried chicken sandwich, chunky coleslaw, Wisconsin-style cheese curds, biscuits and seared shishito peppers. The bubble tea partnership provides many colorful teas with optional toppings like red beans and crushed Oreos, served at varying sweetness, iced to hot. Beer and wine are also served. The bright space has tables in front and back separated by an open kitchen and ordering counter. It took but a few minutes during a recent trial period for this place to become a canteen for nearby Baruch College students.

2018-11-29,How the Myth of the Hedonistic Artist Lost Its Allure,"A PREVAILING NOTION of the lives of artists holds that hedonism is a meaningful part of production. The slide projector on the subject has no shortage of famous faces: There’s boozy Faulkner, banging out novels and screenplays while pickled, and Dorothy Parker and Jackson Pollock, producing their poems and paintings alongside the empty bottles, not to mention those libertine de Sades, Baudelaires and Byrons, who were all about sex and drugs long before rock ’n’ roll introduced the idea that heroin was the magic juice of musical genius, one that spit out Hendrix and Joplin on one sad side and a sober Keith Richards on the happy other. The notion is nothing new. In classical Greece, in fourth- and fifth-century Athens, the major artistic prize of the era, for drama, was given under the auspices of Dionysus, a god of wine and ecstasy. Dionysus is a curious proto-patron saint of the arts, given the story of his birth. Zeus — king of gods, thunder god — wooed the mortal Semele. Hera, Zeus’ wife and the goddess of heaven, tired of her husband’s philandering, learned of Zeus’ latest conquest and convinced Semele to demand that Zeus reveal his true form — lightning — a sight Hera knew would kill her: No mortal can bear a god in full. Zeus assented, Semele died, but Zeus saved Semele’s fetal son, tucking him into his thigh, carrying him to term, earning the child the epithet “twice born”: to a mortal, to a god.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/t-magazine/artists-abstinence-asceticism.html

The second section — “Madness” — belongs to Amar Jaafari, an Iraqi-American economist who is being detained at Heathrow. Halliday’s prose is clean and lean, almost reportorial in the style of W.G.

At Miu Miu’s fall 2018 show, the model Naomi Chin Wing’s windswept bouffant gave her tailored trench coat a more casual feel, while at Valentino’s fall couture presentation, Fran Summers streamed down the runway with an exaggerated lionlike mane blown out around her face. The latter look channeled the unapologetic ’60s-era glamour of Diana Vreeland, noted Guido Palau, the hairstylist behind the colossal hairdos. A modern woman can imagine her own version of it, though. At Chloé’s spring show, for example, models wore a more low-key, but still bouncy, sweptback look. Grand-scale hair looks current and youthful when it’s done with a rakish, imperfect finish, says the mononymous New York-based hairstylist Garren. Nothing should be ironed or finished too neatly, he explains, and there must be “lots of movement.” Here, a guide to supersize blown-out hair that’s (almost) effortless.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/t-magazine/bouffant-big-hair-beauty.html

2018-11-30,T’s Holiday Issue: All Together Now,"It is an irresistible reduction to contrast the eras of our former and current president as absolute opposites: one, an age of progress for all of us who’ve felt or feel shut out from the vast tent that is our country; the other, an age of regress. Yet to think this way ignores evidence to the contrary — evidence in the form of human lives. One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that president’s reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments — it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination). The thrill and sorrow of America is that our brief history is one of steps forward and backward, that ours is a nation in a constant state of revision, that we are each of us choreographers of its halting, tripping, sometimes ugly, sometimes transcendent dance.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/t-magazine/editor-letter.html

The heart of every romance is a love story, and by the last page of the book the lovers wind up together, happily ever after or at least “happily for now.” (Less codified but no less crucial is that no children or pets are harmed.

2018-11-30,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Some fiction writers try to capture reality, using stories to illuminate social conditions or plumb interior lives. Others just like to make up crazy things. (And also illuminate social conditions and interior lives, yes! Don’t @ us.) We like both kinds of fiction around here, but our picks this week decidedly, and determinedly, range beyond the bounds of conventional realism. There’s an austere little fairy tale about the chaos of sexual desire, “The Governesses.” There’s a turbulent, myth-inflected debut that made its author the youngest-ever finalist for the Booker Prize, “Everything Under.” There’s a dystopian New York story about consumerism and immigration, “Severance,” and a surreal Japanese story collection, “The Lonesome Bodybuilder,” that shakes up narrative expectations right alongside social expectations about gender and marriage and body image. And while Louisa Hall’s “Trinity” would seem to be more traditional than any of those — it’s a biographical, historical novel about Robert Oppenheimer and his work on the atomic bomb — even that goes about it in a nontraditional way.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2018-11-30,A Long Visit to Weimar-Era Berlin Through an Epic Graphic Novel,"Every 40 pages or so in Jason Lutes’s BERLIN (Drawn + Quarterly, $49.95), a sequence appears that seems to hold the key to this massive graphic novel. In one of the earliest, a drawing instructor stands before a chalkboard, lecturing on the use of perspective. “The observer’s location is what really determines the placement of a vanishing point,” he explains, and asks his students to consider the views out of three adjacent windows in the studio. “Stand still in front of each and imagine it as a framed picture.” The same scene looks different depending on the observer’s position. It’s a metaphor, of course, for the book itself — an opus of more than 500 pages set in the late 1920s in the titular city, teeming with journalists and junkmen, artists and runaways, fiery rabble-rousers and burnt-out cases from the First World War, perceiving the city with their own nervous systems.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/books/review/jason-lutes-berlin.html

His band was a group of New York musicians, some of whom Mr. McCraven had hardly played with before; what they performed was entirely improvised, but with Mr. McCraven subtly steering, listeners had room to get comfortable, to fall into the music. His thick snare drum splattered against the bulb tones of Joel Ross’s vibraphone patterns, making an elliptical groove. Sometimes Brandee Younger’s plucks on the harp led Mr. McCraven into a buoyant, driving beat. Elsewhere, he minimized himself, letting Dezron Douglas’s bass guide the rhythm.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/music/makaya-mccraven-universal-beings.html
