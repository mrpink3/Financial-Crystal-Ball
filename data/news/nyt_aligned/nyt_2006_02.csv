2006-02-01,A Housing House of Cards,"Financial innovations by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have contributed to sucessful growth of homeownership and largely contributed positively to the housing boom of the past five years. But more than a few critics have said that the innovations are little more than a housing version of gambling in Las Vegas. According to Dudley Baker at www.preciousmetalswarrants.com and subscriber postings to the site, Fannie and Freddie have set up the market for a finanical meltdown should the Federal Reserve increase interest rates. Baker says the meltdown could come as soon as this year with more interest rate increases expected. Amid growing concerns, Freddie Mac CEO and Chairman Richard Syron has defended the company saying it posed no special risk to finanical markets.— RON NIXON",Real Estate,https://walkthrough.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/a-housing-house-of-cards/

Ralph was a life long resident of NYC, born of immigrant parents, Benjamin and Sophie, in 1915. His childhood was immersed with the joys of dance, opera, the Yiddish Theater, and a precious friendship with Manny Dichter. He was blessed to find his true love, Elsie, at 16 and spent the next 73 years with her at his side through all life's joys and travails. He had a long creative career as a marketing executive holding senior positions at Bulova, Lucien Piccard, including Vice President and Secretary at Gruen. A talented tennis player since childhood, he competed in many tournaments including winning the Sears Tennis Tournament in his 70's beating competitors 30 years his junior.

A Shakespeare enthusiast, he often quoted from his work to make points and entertain friends and family. After his retirement he volunteered at LIJ Hospital where he organized educational conferences and read to seriously ill children. He was appointed by the Governor to the Board of Visitors of Queens Children's Psychiatric Center & was its Secretary.

He sponsored dance therapy programs and donated musical equipment through the Ralph and Elsie Somerfield Arts Enrichment Fund. He attended every class conducted by the Ailey dance teachers. He enjoyed lively debates at Temple Beth-El Torah study. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Elsie.

2006-02-02,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SUESHOLTZ, HENRICK DANIEL ''HERB''","SUESHOLTZ--Henrick Daniel ""Herb"". 91, Pioneer in TV and Picture - framing industries. Herb Suesholtz was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn in 1914. In 1935 he received a degree in chemical engineering from prestigious Cooper Union. During the war years he worked for RCA under an important government contract. Mr. Suesholtz was among the lead engineers in developing the radar tubes utilized by American navel vessels. This experience led him to a similar position with RCA following the war's conclusion. In 1946 Mr. Suesholtz left RCA to join tiny Transvision of New Rochelle, NY. He would eventually become president of the company and under his stewardship Transvision became the nation's third leading manufacturer of TV sets, trailing only Zenith and RCA. In addition, Mr. Suesholtz's leadership enabled Transvision to accomplish some firsts in the industry. Such innovations that are now taken for granted -remote control units, cable systems, and ""educational TV"" were introduced by Transvision. During the 1950's Transvision established a picturetube plant in Cuba only to have it ""nationalized"" by Cuba's communist regime. In fact, Mr. Suesholtz was in Cuba at the time Castro and his pary seized power. Though he lost his factory, Mr. Suesholtz did make friends among his Cuban employees, helping several to escape to the U.S. Though he left the television industry in the early 60's, Mr. Suesholtz carried his innovative spirit with him to his next endeavor. In 1969 he acquired the Gaines picture frame moulding factory, renamed it Gaines-American Moulding Corp., and introduced perhaps the greatest change in that industry with the introduction of ""chop service."" This enabled many entrepreneurs with little money to establish their own businesses. First met with almost unanimous opposition from the industry, ""chop service"" is now such a staple of the framing industry that it is more or less taken for granted. From 1982 until his death Mr. Suesholtz worked as an independent sales rep., but never lost his zeal for innovation and invention, evidenced by his registration of four U.S. patents that continue to shape the picture-framing industry. He was noted for stating, many times, that the only disappointment of his life was the loss of his son, Jay B., to leukemia in 1990. However, Mr. Suesholtz is survived by his wife, Florence Monaco Suesholtz of Harrison, NY, son William Suesholtz of Harrison, daughters Wendy Chazin and Amy Cooper of Manhattan, step-son Robert Miraglia of Arizona, and grandson Christipher Chazin of Manhattan. Mr. Suesholtz's family will be receiving friends on Friday between 12 noon and 1PM. Interment to follow at the Greenwood Union Cemetery, Rye, NY.

On Feb. 20, Mr. Roberts becomes senior national correspondent at CNN, a posting that enables him to contribute to programs across that cable channel's lineup, Jon Klein, president of CNN's domestic operations, said in a statement. Mr. Roberts, who joined CBS in 1992 as anchor of the ""CBS Morning News"" and has covered the White House for the network for more than six years, becomes one of the more recognizable reporters on the CNN roster. Any chance that Mr. Roberts had of succeeding Mr. Rather -- a plan favored by several senior CBS News executives -- effectively evaporated after Mr. Rather stepped down as anchor amid the fallout of a disputed ""60 Minutes Wednesday"" segment about President Bush's Vietnam-era National Guard service. At the time, Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS, said he hoped the news division would consider scrapping a single anchor format. Sean McManus, the new president of CBS News, said at a gathering of television critics last month that he expected to name a solo anchor -- and preferably an outsider -- as a permanent successor to Mr. Rather.

2006-02-02,World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Jobs Cut in BCE Overhaul,"BCE, the parent company of Bell Canada, will shed 4,000 jobs and spin off its satellite and rural telephone operations. The company, based in Montreal, which also plans a share buyback, made the announcements yesterday after reducing its profit outlook for 2006 to 1.80 Canadian dollars ($1.57) to 1.90 Canadian dollars ($1.65) a share from 2.05 Canadian dollars ($1.79) last year. About 1.6 million telephone lines in Ontario and Quebec will be turned over to a new income trust, a business structure in Canada that pays out most of a company's cash directly to its owners and avoids most corporate taxes. BCE will retain a 50 percent holding in the trust and its operations will largely be handled in a contract with Bell Canada. BCE will sell Telesat Canada, a communications satellite operator, too, but will increase the company's debt first. Then BCE will transfer about 1 billion Canadian dollars of Telesat's cash to its accounts. It is expected that BCE will generate about 4 billion Canadian dollars ($3.5 billion) from the two asset sales.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/business/world-business-briefing-americas-canada-jobs-cut-in-bce-overhaul.html

2006-02-02,World Business Briefing | Americas: Mexico: New Tactic by Grupo Televisa,"In a new legal maneuver, the Mexican media company Grupo Televisa is looking for a way to break its programming deal with the American Spanish-language broadcaster Univision. As part of a lawsuit seeking back royalties from Univision, Televisa said this week that Univision was in material breach of the licensing deal that supplies the network with most of its prime-time schedule, according to a filing by Univision with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two companies first negotiated the 25-year deal in 1992, but Televisa executives now believe that their company can earn more for its programming as the Spanish-language audience in the United States has grown. Televisa, which is based in Mexico City, owns about 11 percent of Univision and has been openly critical of Univision's chairman, A. Jerrold Perenchio. ""Univision emphatically disagrees with Televisa's characterization of its claims and will take all necessary action to ensure Televisa's continued performance under the programming license agreement until its expiration in 2017,"" Univision said in its court filing.

The staff and members of our 275,000-member health care union mourn the passing of beloved friend and ally Coretta Scott King. She was an inspiring champion of racial and economic justice, peace and the rights of working women. She was a lifelong foe of racism, poverty and violence. She lived a life of strength, grace, principle, sacrifice and beauty. Mrs. King first met 1199ers through her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s close association with our union. After his tragic death in 1968 she became a regular at 1199 rallies, picketlines and cultural events. Members from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to Hahneman Hospital in Philadelphia to St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan remember meeting her at rallies outside their workplaces. At 1199 conventions and Black History month celebrations she repeatedly called for justice for working mothers. But her most enduring association with 1199 hospital workers came in 1969 during the 100-day strike of 400 black women at two Charleston, South Carolina hospitals. Mrs. King marched, led prayer vigils, spoke in churches and buoyed the spirits of Charleston strikers in an inspiring display of leadership that fused soul power and union power. Over the years her quiet and eloquent dignity overcame bombs, bullets and tragic loss in her ongoing quest to realize the shared dream of a beloved community.

2006-02-02,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BEHLER, JOHN L.","BEHLER--John L. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are profoundly saddened by the death of our esteemed colleague, John L. Behler. As Curator of Herpetology, Behler began his WCS career in 1970 in the Reptile Department and as an intern. John's knowledge and love of wildlife included working with WCS field staff on related projects in Madagascar and Asia and is known and appreciated worldwide. His work exemplified the long history of WCS setting standards for others to follow. He assumed a leadership role among his peers in groundbreaking captive breeding programs for endangered crocodilians, tortoises and freshwater turtles and also focused on the ecology and behavior of reptilians. John's wit, charm and dedication allowed him to share his life's work with many. Among his numerous affiliations, John was a founding member of the American Zoo and Aquarium's Crocodilian Advisory Group and worked closely with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's Endangered Species Unit. Likewise, Behler served his community on the Sommers Conservation Board and Muscoot Farm Nature Center in Westchester County Park. Behler authored more than 40 popular scientific articles, five guidebooks highlighting reptilians and amphibians and coauthored a book, ""Frogs-A Chorus of Colors"" with his wife, Deborah Behler. We're all saddened by the loss of our friend, a great scientist and conservationist. Our heartfelt sympathies go to John's wife, Debbie; mother, Mildred; sister, Judy Howells; John's children, Cindy Sibilia, and David Behler and his five grandchildren. David T.

Bush was an isolationist. If by ‘isolationist’ we mean ‘doesn’t want to use military force to halt genocides’ then every president except Bill Clinton is an isolationist.

2006-02-03,RONALD K. BROWN/EVIDENCE,"Lots of news releases yammer on about fusion, but the choreographer Ronald K. Brown is the real deal. For the last 20 years, his Brooklyn-based company, Evidence, has been exploring dance idioms from across the African Diaspora, mixing Cuban, Caribbean, West African and modern American dance forms with an impressively light touch. The result? Percussive, high-energy works that joyously splice complex rhythms with a deep but down-to-earth spirituality. In dances like ""Serving Nia"" and ""Come Ye,"" all the world seems to be Mr. Brown's church. On Tuesday, the company (which includes Mr. Brown above, with Tiffany Jackson, left, and Arcell Cabug) opens a week of performances at the Joyce Theater to celebrate its anniversary. Two separate programs highlight works from the latter half of Evidence's existence, including the stunning ""Grace,"" created for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1999; the mysterious meditation ""Walking Out the Dark,"" from 2003; and ""High Life,"" from 2000, which charts the northward migration of African-Americans. There will also be a New York premiere, ""Order My Steps,"" which features the music of Bob Marley, Terry Riley and the gospel singer Fred Hammond. (Tuesday through Feb. 11 at 8 p.m., Feb. 12 at 7:30 p.m., with 2 p.m. matinees on Feb. 11 and 12, the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38.)

Spevok, of Kenilworth, IL, on Sunday, January 29, 2006 in an auto accident. Beloved husband of Elisabeth (nee Pratt), loving father of Katherine, Eleanor, and Phillip, loved son of Stanley and Catherine. Greg was a Managing Director of the Corporate and Real Estate Capital Markets Groups at LaSalle Bank Corporation. He enjoyed an outstanding reputation at the forefront of the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities business. Not only was Greg a charismatic and compelling leader, but he possessed an impressive technical command of the real estate lending business. In spite of his professional success, Greg was always humble and approachable. Competitors routinely sought his counsel, and, like those who worked with him, considered Greg to be a steadfast friend. His real estate lending career was extensive. Prior to LaSalle, he was the Director of Originations for Bear Stearns' CMBS unit, where he built the firm's nationwide source network as a member of the senior management team that repeatedly set the CMBS industry's record subordination levels. Previously, he established FINOVA Capital's East Coast commercial real estate lending practice. He also created and led the real estate lending program for Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank's Tokyo Leasing (USA). He began his career as an Analyst in the Financial Institutions Group of First National Bank of Chicago, for which he served in both Chicago and New York. His integrity, acumen and reputation, led to LaSalle Bank hiring Greg to head its CMBS operation out of Chicago. Under Greg's leadership, LaSalle Bank's CMBS unit met with great success. Greg oversaw the unit's growth from a nominal regional player to one of the dominant forces in real estate loan securitization. Greg also served as the driving force behind the emergence of the Bank's Multifamily Finance Group as a ""top 3"" provider of capital to the apartment and manufactured housing sectors. In 1992, he was the principal founder of the Real Estate Lender's Association, Inc., the largest lenders-only commercial real estate organization in the U.S. Other involvements include Sustaining Fellow of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Founder's Council of the Field Museum; the Real Estate Roundtable's Capital Advisory Policy committee; and the Board of Directors of the National Multi Housing Council. Services will be held Friday, 2:00 at the Holy Comforter Church, 222 Kenilworth Avenue, Kenilworth, Illinois. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to either the Joseph Sears School Foundation, or the Art Institute of Chicago.

2006-02-03,IN THE COUNTRY,"The pianist Morten Qvenild has had a hand in some of Norway's most expressive postmodern jazz ensembles, including the electronic juggernaut Jaga Jazzist, the powder-keg outfit known as Shining and a supergroup called the National Bank. Left to his own devices, Mr. Qvenild seems to favor a more intimate sensibility: In the Country, his acoustic trio with the bassist Roger Arntzen and the drummer Pal Hausken (above center, with Mr. Arntzen, left and Mr. Qvenild), wrings dramatic suspense out of slender quietude and shimmering abstraction. Last year the group issued a gorgeous debut album -- aptly titled ""This Was the Pace of My Heartbeat"" (Rune Grammofon) -- which occasionally invokes the supple pointillism of the pianist Paul Bley and the drummer Paul Motian. (At other times, its monumental dynamic range and stately thematic development can bring the Bad Plus to mind.) More than anything, the album underscores a collective reverence for melody; Mr. Qvenild's songs have the simplicity of folk lullabies, and he takes virtually no liberties with the two songs he didn't compose, the Handel aria ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" and the Ryan Adams ballad ""In My Time of Need."" There's no telling whether the dynamic will mutate with the addition of the guitarist Marc Ribot, who joins In the Country for the group's United States debut at Tonic next week. Adding another layer of mystery, the evening will also include a set by Lars Horntveth, the charismatic saxophonist, guitarist and keyboardist who leads Jaga Jazzist. Mr. Horntveth's most recent solo effort, ""Pooka"" (Smalltown Supersound), reimagines a Gil Evans-style orchestration for a nine-piece string ensemble, with electronic percussion; this will be his United States debut, too.

She would have been 45 later this month. A graduate of the Phillips Exeter Academy and Barnard College, Suzette served as financial advisor to trusts, estates, and private foundations, as well as wealthy individuals and their families. Suzette had spoken before various groups and organizations on financial planning, including the NYU Institute of Law and Taxation, the Practising Law Institute, the New York Women's Bar Association, the Network for Women's Services and many others. She taught personal financial planning at the undergraduate and professional levels at Marymount Manhattan College and Iona College. She also appeared on WNBC, CNN, and other media outlets to answer questions on personal financial planning.

2006-02-03,NILAJA SUN,"If there were an award for best performance in the worst role, Nilaja Sun would be a leading candidate, since she manages to brighten an otherwise dim formula comedy in ""Huck & Holden."" This ditsy cross-cultural romance about an awkward Indian student who falls for an African-American librarian includes several characters who appear in dream sequences, including Ms. Sun's Kali, the Indian goddess. Any talented actor can shine in a great play, but it takes a true professional to make weak material look good. To be fair, the comedy is good for a few laughs if you like the kind of humor practiced by the writers of the ""American Pie"" movies. If not, you can admire the performance of Ms. Sun (above right), who arrives late in a screamingly loud costume with four arms and delivers her admonishments with so much comic energy and conviction that she forces you to pay attention. It almost seems as if she's acting in her own show, which makes sense, since Ms. Sun -- whose performance in her homage to Spalding Gray, ""Blues for a Gray Sun,"" proved that she can be both subtle and broad -- has written and starred in several one-woman shows. Her next one, ""No Child,"" opens in May at the Beckett Theater and is directed by Hal Brooks (""Thom Pain""). Best to keep a close eye on her.

This ditsy cross-cultural romance about an awkward Indian student who falls for an African-American librarian includes several characters who appear in dream sequences, including Ms. Sun's Kali, the Indian goddess. Any talented actor can shine in a great play, but it takes a true professional to make weak material look good. To be fair, the comedy is good for a few laughs if you like the kind of humor practiced by the writers of the ""American Pie"" movies. If not, you can admire the performance of Ms. Sun (above right), who arrives late in a screamingly loud costume with four arms and delivers her admonishments with so much comic energy and conviction that she forces you to pay attention. It almost seems as if she's acting in her own show, which makes sense, since Ms. Sun Â whose performance in her homage to Spalding Gray, ""Blues for a Gray Sun,"" proved that she can be both subtle and broad Â has written and starred in several one-woman shows. Her next one, ""No Child,"" opens in May at the Beckett Theater and is directed by Hal Brooks (""Thom Pain""). Best to keep a close eye on her.

They may speak their language, eat their food and practice their religion–but at home or by private arrangement. That is as far as I would go with multiculturalism. All else–including an insistence on a public affirmation of ethnic frills and fancies–cripples the process of integration.” … Pro-choicers William Saletan and Katha Pollitt debate the question, “Is Abortion Bad?” in Slate, extending a debate that began with Saletan’s Times op-ed and Pollitt’s response in The Nation. … Should they make a movie about Harper Lee, too? At First Things, Wilfred McClay suggests that “To Kill a Mockingbird” ranks among the most historically important books of the 20th century: “I think one could argue that ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ did for twentieth-century race relations, or at any rate for white attitudes toward blacks, what ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ did for white attitudes about slavery in the antebellum nineteenth century. And yet it is rarely examined as a work of serious literature, not to mention one whose convicting force changed the moral life of the nation.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/english-only-sotus-the-morality-of-abortion-and-the-20th-century-uncle-toms-cabin/

But it wasn't enough for the United States government. This week, an appeal from the Chinese-born writer Yiyun Li for permanent residency on the grounds of ""extraordinary ability in the arts"" was denied, Ms. Li said yesterday. A letter she received on Monday dismissed her appeal because, she said, when she first filed her petition in 2004, ""the very high standard set by Congress"" had not been met: she had not yet received her O'Connor award, and her book ""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" (Random House, 2005) had not been published. The rejection of the appeal was first reported yesterday in The Washington Post. ""Of course, I'm very sad,"" said Ms. Li, 33, who has written for The New York Times Magazine and The Paris Review and who teaches creative writing at Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She is married to a Chinese man who is also not a citizen but has two young children who were born in the United States. ""It's a long process,"" she said.

PEN's decision this week came after a recent article in L.A. Weekly said that a memoirist calling himself Nasdijj, whose three books under that name are about the troubled life of an American Indian man, is actually Timothy Barrus, left, a white man who has written gay pornography. In the three Nasdijj books, he says he was born on a Navajo reservation and was raped by his white father, and describes in hyperpoetic style a life of hardship and loss. One book, ""The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping,"" was one of five winners of the 2004 PEN/Beyond Margins Awards for writers of color, and another, ""The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams,"" was a finalist for a PEN memoir award. Michael Roberts, the executive director of PEN, said the center would not rescind the Margins prize since it did not come with any money, but he added that from now on publishers and individuals who nominate writers will be asked to confirm the writers' eligibility. According to L.A. Weekly, Nasdijj posted a statement on his Web site (www.nasdijj.typepad.com) using his real name; the name has since been removed.

It's also one that Isaacson, who is the president and C.E.O. of the Aspen Institute, a public policy center, finds hard to answer. As a former managing editor of Time magazine and chairman of CNN, Isaacson is aware of how the press can and should function, but he is also the author of a biography of Henry Kissinger and the co-author, with Evan Thomas, of ""The Wise Men,"" a study of six policy makers who helped guide the country through the early years of the cold war. ""During my years as a journalist,"" he wrote in an e-mail message, ""one of the most sensitive issues was balancing security concerns with our instinct to report everything we knew. Now, given the terrorist threat, it's even more difficult. I would be inclined these days to hold back information if it could help terrorists.

The procedure, called microfracture surgery, is daunting: an orthopedist removes loose cartilage and drills holes in the end of the femur. These ""microfractures"" bleed and clot, leading to the formation of new cartilage. The list of players who have had the surgery and struggled to return to peak level reads like an all-star team from the late 90's: Penny Hardaway, Jamal Mashburn, Allan Houston, Chris Webber. ""You hear stories of guys not coming back, or coming back less strong,"" Randolph says. ""This was my first surgery, and everything I was hearing about it was bad.""

Icarus was given wings of feathers and wax -- high-tech, aerodynamic equipment in its day -- with which to flee the confines of his existence. His flight coach warned him to avoid hovering too low, lest he wipe out on a wave, or soaring too high, lest he flame out. But Icarus was a fiend for novelty and daring. Flying felt good. It felt free. Icarus caught tremendous air, as the saying goes, and launched himself through the sky. He could sense the temperature rising. It must, he thought, be the heat of the moment, that special flush that animates adventure seekers. But it was more than that. It was the sun. Soon, Icarus' gear was toast. He fell. He streaked across the horizon, and disappeared into the sea with a splash. Some observers were saddened by the spectacle.

Sister Jean served St. Francis Hospital in a number of different capacities for over 50 years and was a living and spiritual bridge from the hospital's early days as a summer camp for children to its position today as one of the nation's leading heart centers. Sister Jean was a much beloved member of the St. Francis family. She began her service in 1941 as one of 55 nuns caring for 200 underprivileged children with rheumatic heart disease who lived at the St. Francis Sanatorium. In addition to cooking, cleaning, and providing nursing care, her work included traveling to local farms and asking for contributions of produce to help feed the children. Later, when the institution opened its doors to adult patients and became St. Francis Hospital, Sister Jean directed the volunteers at the information desk and was always a welcoming and cheering presence. Throughout her service, Sister Jean's steadfast commitment to philanthropy became legendary. We will be forever grateful to Sister Jean for her selfless dedication to St. Francis Hospital and her love for all the members of our family. We will cherish her legacy and always be inspired by her example. We extend our deepest sympathies to Sister Jean's family and to the many friends who were touched by her devoted, caring and generous spirit.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/classified/paid-notice-deaths-pignone-sister-jean-m-fmm.html

The Buccaneers scored in the final minute and needed only to kick the extra point to tie the game and send it into overtime. But when an offside penalty negated a blocked kick and nudged his team to the 1-yard line from the 2, head coach Jon Gruden went for the 2-point conversion, a rare move under normal circumstances and almost unheard of late in a game. (Only once before had an N.F.L. game been won by a last-minute 2-point conversion.) GrudenÂs decision was successful Â his team won, 36-35 Â and significant for both teams. It kept the Bucs in playoff contention and sent the ÂSkins into a tailspin: they lost two more games and had to win their last five to make the playoffs (where they exacted revenge on the Bucs in the first round).

In his recently published biography of Cassavetes, ""ACCIDENTAL GENIUS"" (Miramax Books), the critic Marshall Fine lays out the story behind the film, including Cassavetes's hands-on contribution and Ms. May's astonishing ability to burn through celluloid. Mr. Fine notes that Ms. May shot more than twice as much film as it took to get ""Gone With the Wind"" in the can, but her struggles to get her modestly scaled wonderment into the world were worth every frame, dollar and drop of blood.

Lisbon is like San Francisco: the red bridge, the cable cars, very hilly, rains off and on all the time -- it reminded me so much of San Francisco that I was wondering what awaited me there. After the photo was taken, there was the most beautiful rainbow, as if someone had painted it in the sky.

(Branch, who is 59, initially thought that writing King's biography would be three years' worth of work; it has taken him 24 years. The combined trilogy clocks in at 2,912 pages.) The previous two volumes also appeared here in hardcover. The first, ""Parting the Waters,"" made the list for three months in 1989, rising as high as No. 6. The second, ""Pillar of Fire,"" was a best seller for three weeks in 1998, rising as high as No. 12. In an interview with Joe Burris of The Baltimore Sun, Branch said that while there are ""100 movies"" he could imagine being made from the material in his trilogy, he's all but given up hope of seeing any kind of film version. (At one point, ABC had planned an eight-hour mini-series, and Jonathan Demme considered making a feature film.) ""It's been close but no cigar,"" Branch said, ""with a lot of heartache."" Also on this week's hardcover nonfiction list: Oprah Winfrey's new pick, Elie Wiesel's memoir ""Night,"" moves to No. 5.

2006-02-06,The Way We Eat: Schnitzel on the Brain,"Fifty-odd years ago, the journalist Joseph Wechsberg introduced many Americans to the pleasures of Austro-Hungarian food, but somehow the cuisine faded in the shadow of French cooking. Such fare may not quite be trendy these days, but it has at last gained a certain gravity and visibility, thanks largely to Kurt Gutenbrunner, the New York City chef and restaurateur. He recently added Blaue Gans, a fifth, more casual restaurant with German leanings, to his collection of Wallsé, Café Sabarsky, Café Fledermaus and Thor. Unlike David Bouley, whose well-regarded Danube plays with certain Austro-Hungarian dishes, Gutenbrunner makes it his mission to introduce fusion-minded customers to such unadulterated classics as kavalierspitz (boiled beef served with apple horseradish, potatoes and creamed spinach). ""I cook it the same way every single day,"" he said. ""This is what classical musicians do: they play a classic well, doing it over and over again the right way."" The truth is, Americans might not recognize his masterly technique. They need a little tutorial in the Austro-Hungarian culinary canon -- the schnitzels, spaetzles, goulashes and all those astounding pastries.

You're a pro prospect looking to impress coaches, scouts and Hollywood agents. You try to get drafted, sign a record deal and start a clothing line. There's even a Build-a-Crib feature.

Dad donned a polyester maroon suit and smoothed down his sideburns, and the four of us piled into the car for the brief trip to Pasadena Community Church. A local Methodist congregation, the church was well known in St. Petersburg for its lush outdoor ""garden sanctuary"" filled with fountains, palm trees, hibiscus, and bottlebrush.

2006-02-06,Nonfiction Chronicle,"CURRY: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors. By Lizzie Collingham. (Oxford University, $28.) To the growing list of food microhistories with punchy titles, like ""Salt,"" ""Cod"" and ""Spice,"" add ""Curry,"" a lively study of Indian cooking from the Mogul Empire of the 1600's to Utsav in 21st-century Manhattan, one of the ""new breed"" of Indian restaurants. It's a long but tasty journey, made easily digestible by Collingham, who was seduced by Indian food when she drank a ""thick, velvety"" lassi in Bombay in 1994. Curry, it turns out, is a British classification, a catchall based on a term used by Portuguese colonists, ""who described as 'caril' or 'carree' the broths that the Indians 'made with butter, the pulp of Indian nuts . . . and all sorts of spices.' "" Indeed, the poor British come in for frequent roastings by Collingham: as gluttons during their colonial rule over India (loading their tables with ""turkeys that you could not see over""); culinary philistines (""there was virtually nothing that the British would not stew in curry sauce""); and bigots (""the consumption of large quantities of curry has not necessarily made the British any less racist""). Collingham, a historian by training, builds her book dish by dish, starting with chicken tikka masala. As the cuisine changes with new ingredients like the chili pepper (which arrived in India in the early 1500's from South America) and the importation of foreign eating and cooking habits, you feel selfishly grateful it came to travel the world, yet also fearful of the losses the globalization of food can bring.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html

He manages to save lives by harboring more than a thousand Tutsis at the hotel, but it is never clear exactly who will escape and who will not before the madness ends.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/arts/television/movies-on-tv.html

At the moment, the thorniest dispute over the issue concerns a male-circumcision ritual practiced by some Hasidic Jews in New York. The ritual is called oral suction, or metzitzah b'peh. After removing the foreskin, the mohel, who conducts the circumcision, cleans the wound by sucking blood from it. According to city health officials, the ritual may have caused three infants circumcised by the same mohel in 2003 and 2004 to contract neonatal herpes (one of the infants subsequently died). New York's city health commissioner recently issued a warning about the dangers of oral suction, leading some Orthodox Jewish leaders to complain that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had reneged on promises to let religious authorities handle the issue. Meanwhile, secularists like the writer Christopher Hitchens have attacked the mayor for banning smoking in restaurants while failing to protect helpless children from diseases transmitted by ""religious fanatics.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/is-ritual-circumcision-religious-expression.html

In it he stands alone, at his free safety position, right leg forward, hands on his hips, lips slightly apart, waiting for the snap of the ball. What regularly occurred next on the football field was what inspired the National Football League Hall of Fame, in 1989, to commission the massive bronze bust that sits on the mantel next to the photograph.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/first-to-the-ball.html

The editor suggested that maybe Blythe should harness that, er, passion. The result is ""To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever"" (HarperCollins, $25). The book begs comparisons to Nick Hornby's $(3$)Fever Pitch$(2$) but owes its debt more than anything to maybe the greatest sports novel of all time, Frederick Exley's ""A Fan's Notes."" Blythe knows a thing or two about bitterness and longing, but tempers these twin emotions with intelligence and humor and even generosity. It goes without saying that if you hate Duke you should read this book. But if you love Duke, or you love basketball, or you just love the kind of sportswriting that comes along so rarely you can count the classics on one hand, you should read this book.

He was blessed to find his true love, Elsie, at 16 and spent the next 73 years with her at his side through all life's joys and travails. He had a long creative career as a marketing executive holding senior positions at Bulova, Lucien Piccard, including Vice President and Secretary at Gruen. A talented tennis player since childhood, he competed in many tournaments including winning the Sears Tennis Tournament in his 70's beating competitors 30 years his junior. His love of tennis was only exceeded by his love of chocolate to which he attributed his long life. A Shakespeare enthusiast, he often quoted from his work to make points and entertain friends and family. After his retirement he volunteered at LIJ Hospital where he organized educational conferences and read to seriously ill children. He was appointed by the Governor to the Board of Visitors of Queens Children's Psychiatric Center & was its Secretary. He was a fearless fighter for children against the political powers favoring funding cuts for the disadvantaged. He sponsored dance therapy programs and donated musical equipment through the Ralph and Elsie Somerfield Arts Enrichment Fund. He attended every class conducted by the Ailey dance teachers. He enjoyed lively debates at Temple Beth-El Torah study. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Elsie.

(Last time we looked, he ranked fourth and was second in double-doubles -- shorthand for at least 10 points and 10 rebounds in a game.) ""I could see it if I was 6-9,"" Marion says. ""But I'm 6-7, and I'm averaging a double-double. I mean, that's not realistic.""",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/the-american-jumping-bean.html

Dan Futterman, the writer of “Capote” who warmed up by reading Janet Malcolm’s “The Journalist and the Murderer” and Gerald Clarke’s exquisite biography of Capote, comes straight at the truth of the movie (and perhaps why it resonates so much with people in showbiz and media): “Anybody in this kind of business — whether acting, writing, or directing — who denies that ambition, public recognition, and respect drive them is lying to themselves.” The Bagger makes no such claim – still, he sees no reason to type unless his name is at the top – and wrote, way back when, about the cravenness that lies at the heart of “Capote.” On the acting front, one noted film observer points out that in playing “Transamerica’s” Bree, Felicity Huffman ”acts the bejeezus out of this.” O.K., so it’s William H. Macy, who happens to be married to her, but the Bagger watched the movie again this weekend – nothing like a little transsexual drama to leaven Super Bowl weekend, right? – and he’s right. Keira Knightly looks like an angel and swears like a sailor in describing her turn as Elizabeth in “Pride & Prejudice.” Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is just about talked out after all his trips to the podium, offers up aphoristic majesty. “The older you get, it’s not the competition that matters. It’s the challenge.” The Bagger thinks he remembers hearing that on the Super Bowl post-game show. For Oscar completists, EW’s tour de Oscar is a must-click.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/06/ewwwwwwwwwww/
2006-02-06,Cartoon Catfight,"Not much in the way of linkage or sourcing here, but there seem to be some bad feelings afoot out in the goofy, lucrative funhouse of animation. Jeffrey Katzenberg is campaigning madly for another animated Oscar with the clay-animation feature “Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” from Dreamworks. The movie gained a bit of momentum this weekend when it took top honors from the International Animated Film Society. But some people on the other end of the hard sell are getting their backs up, finding “Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride” more soulful and less commercial – or else finding that “Howl’s Moving Castle” is a far more magical example of the art form. It is ironic – the Bagger is never quite sure exactly what the word means, but he will ask Graydon Carter sometime – that at a time when billions are changing hands over Pixar, there is no film of computer-generated imagery deemed Oscar-worthy this year.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/06/cartoon-catfight/
2006-02-06,The Rugrats Know More than We Do,"If you’re looking for actual wisdom, you could do a lot worse than skipping the Bagger’s post on Friday and getting into the comments section, where many people who actually know what they are talking about weighed in with some rather impressive Oscar historical deconstruction. Steve4992 points out that the correlate between editing and best picture breaks down when it comes to a film actually winning best picture, and offers a nice little bit of algebra instead: “DGA plus Golden Globe for best pic drama or musical/comedy plus most Oscar noms or tied for most Oscar noms” equals victory, always. He concludes “Brokeback Mountain” is a shoe-in because it meets all these various and sundry criteria. Another rugrat, if the Bagger may be so bold, pointed out that “BBM’s” eight nominations is a pretty small number in the context of Oscar history. In the modern era, Hugo points out, only three films, “The Greatest Show on Earth,” (five noms) “Annie Hall” (five noms), and “Ordinary People” (five noms), have won the big magilla after receiving fewer than seven nominations, which is a hurdle “BBM” got over, but not by much. The Bagger obviously needs all the help he can get and is beginning to see the comments section as a large network of serially linked computers, with a reigning deity named Zimmergirl, See for yourself. (Although one industry maven, whose predictions the Bagger has come to rely on but can’t cite by name, has suggested that there is a real, actual fight for best picture between “BBM” and “Crash,” with “BBM” ahead by a nose for the time being.)",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/06/the-rugrats-know-more-than-we-do/
2006-02-06,Spun and Nicely Done,"Last Friday, the Bagger was spun like a prop on a C-130. He thought he had discovered cold fusion, but was merely exploited by forces behind “Crash.” (That is, technical guilds are made nervous by “Brokeback Mountain” but have a crush on “Crash.”) By the time he published this chestnut, it was as common on the web as an online banking scam. The Bagger realizes now that he was merely in receipt of conventional wisdom with a side of propaganda and vows in the future more chase when marketing stuff that plops in over the transom. Now: the new Bagger, less credulous, less windy, more links.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/06/spun-and-nicely-done/

The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of Miriam Benjamin of Sarasota, Florida. Mrs. Benjamin was a founder of our Sarasota/Gulf Coast Chapter and prior to moving to Florida, was a National Vice President of the ATS Women's Division. She was a Life Trustee of the ATS Board of Regents and an Honorary Life Member of the Technion International Board of Governors. Mrs. Benjamin and her late husband Louis were both Technion Guardians, demonstrating the highest level of commitment to Israel and the Technion. The Louis and Miriam Benjamin Chair in Computers and Communication Networks, The Louis and Miriam Benjamin Signal Processing Laboratory and The Louis and Miriam Benjamin/Sarasota Chapter Auditorium are but a part of the Benjamins' legacy that will help generations of students become Israel's leaders in the high-tech fields that are the foundation of Israel's future. Revered as unequaled in their outstanding generosity and steadfast dedication to the Technion, Miriam and Louis were both awarded Technion Honorary Fellowships as well as Honorary Doctorates. They are the only couple in the Technion's history to be so recognized. Our hearts go out to Mrs. Benjamin's daughter, Carol B. Epstein, ATS Washington, D.C.

2006-02-08,Metro Briefing | New York: Settlement Would Protect Prospective Tenants,"Thousands of New York City tenants would get some new protection against inaccurate and outdated Housing Court data that is often used by landlords seeking to screen out undesirable tenants, under a tentative settlement with the largest tenant agency in the country. ""It is a very big deal, but there are a lot of other issues remaining,"" said Michael McKee, who runs a tenant political action committee. ""People are constantly saying, 'but if I take the landlord to court, I might end up on the black list.' It has had a tremendous chilling effect."" In the past, the screening agency, now known as First Advantage SafeRent, simply reported the filing of suits for eviction or nonpayment of rent and not the final disposition of cases. The draft agreement, which must be approved by a judge, requires the screening agency to update its files regularly with information on the outcome of cases, and to expunge records of suits when tenants show that the court found a case to be without merit or filed in error. A spokesman for First Advantage declined to comment on the agreement before the judge's hearing.

""It isn't just a question of needing money to rehire their staffs, but in a totally changed city, how do you go about your business?"" said Deborah Marrow, director of the Getty Foundation, which supports the visual arts. The number of arts organizations that will benefit remains to be seen. Guidelines for applicants will be posted on the foundation's Web site, www.getty.edu/foundation. Typically, the foundation's gifts range from $5,000 to $250,000, Ms. Marrow said. ""It's a first step,"" she added. ""I hope what will come out of it is a road map for the future and that it will be a catalyst for other funding."" The grant is the foundation's second contribution to the hurricane recovery; it donated $100,000 toward the National Trust for Historic Preservation's efforts to assess damage to historic buildings and districts.

It was not just because he spilled his coffee when he opened up the New York Post and saw the Vanity Fair picture of the pair with some homeless guy who apparently wandered into the shoot. And it wasn’t even that Ms. Johansson was selling crack, visually, in one of those magazine covers that will live in infamy. It’s just that the Bagger did not want to participate in the objectification of two of the more promising young actors of our time – he’s got three daughters to think about, after all. But last night he found a much more chaste link – Reuters via Yahoo – with a postage-size picture that renders its more naughty bits in miniature. Turns out Rachel McAdams decided not to go there at the last minute and bowed out, and that the issue includes George Clooney as well, although he kept his clothes on, perhaps because he didn’t want to reveal some of the stretch marks he picked up by beefing up for his role in “Syriana.” ",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/vanity-nudity-pruditry/
2006-02-08,The Sensitive-Artist Type,"The Bagger has been neglecting his bookmarks of late and they have been neglecting hm him back. One of the nicer bits he missed was the Hollywood Reporter’s roundtable with the writers nominated for the Writers Guild of America awards. (“Crash” and “Brokeback Mountain” won for original and scripted screenplay, respectively.) Everybody in the gang chat did their bit and played to type, with writer-director Stephen Gaghan making sure he put across the undue burden of not only writing a film, but directing it as well. Directors, he explained, are called on to make 10,000 decisions a day, “any one of which could change the movie irrevocably. That’s anxiety.” The writer of “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” Judd Apatow, suggested they had the bong-wielding contingent of writers locked up. “”It’s nice to know that writers still smoke reefer,” he said, by way of explaining how the comedy he wrote got some play from the writers guild while it was ignored everywhere else during the award season. And Diana Ossana opened up a vein on those things that troubled her sleep: “The tagline ‘gay cowboy movie’ really annoyed us.” Gosh, she’s right — that is SO unfair. Paul Haggis, who wrote, directed, produced – and for all we know, worked in craft services on – “Crash,” said he’s all for someone abjectly loving or loathing his film. “I’d much rather have that than have someone say, ‘Nice film, man.’ That’s a stake through your heart.” Yeah, and that’s mighty ugly to contemplate as well.

Over at Fox411, Roger Friedman speculates that when the feds get to the bottom of the intrigue and double-cross, they might find someone who looks a lot like Michael Ovitz. All of the speculation, which has hit DefCom 4, actually threatens to overtake the Oscars as Hollywood’s chief preoccupation. And that just doesn’t seem right.

2006-02-08,Splitsville,"The Bagger stopped by the Bruce Wasserstein/Carl Icahn investor road show at the St. Regis yesterday. Mr. Wasserstein spent 30 minutes explaining why breaking Time Warner into a million little pieces – well, at least four – makes inescapable business sense. Not your great Oscar story, but pickings are slim this time of the season, and the Bagger will do what he can with what he’s got. In this instance, if the pressure from Icahn were to force a de-merger, Warner Brothers, one of Hollywood’s most reliable producers of tentpoles, would end up as its own darn thing, more or less. If things go that way, Warner might think about commissioning a movie called, “It Came from Another Part of the Boardroom,” a thinly veiled biopic of Mr. Icahn, who managed to mangle Shakespeare and misidentify his would-be compatriot Mr. Wasserstein as “Ken.” Mr. Wasserstein expressed significant admiration for News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch, but the gooey feeling is far from mutual. In an interview, Mr. Murdoch pointed out that Viacom Inc., another major media conglomerate, has so far achieved “little or nothing” for its shareholders in deciding to break up into two entities at the beginning of this year.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/splitsville/

Hollywood has its rituals – the breakfast meeting being one of the more foul and unholy expressions of SoCal culture he finds inhumane – but in Manhattan, people frequently attend dinner parties out of a sense of duty, or fear that they will be left out the next time and actually get to do what they want instead. A frequent motif is dinner guests pretending to listen to each other but actually just rehearsing to come up with a sassy bit to top the person sitting to their left. But the Bagger’s fears were misplaced. Dinner was lovely, the company was rocking, and he got a chance to talk a great deal about his favorite topic.

Pasley, a history professor at the University of Missouri, writes at Common-Place that the debate over the National Security Agency domestic spying program is decidedly post-1776: “The recent conflict over President Bush’s domestic surveillance program reflects one of the oldest recurring divisions in American politics, dating all the way to the 1790s” and that decade’s debates between the Jeffersonian Republicans and the Hamiltonian Federalists. Jefferson and his allies believed the government’s powers to be limited “by the values and rules embedded in our founding documents,” while Hamilton and friends believed that “the inherent nature of government” gave it “essentially unlimited” powers.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/is-bush-modeling-lincoln-on-war-powers/

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is captioned, ""Who is this colossal goddess?"" The question asked in a Rome courtroom yesterday was, ""Where does she come from?"" The fifth-century-B.C. statue, believed to be of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, may be the most important ancient artifact at the core of the trial of Marion True, the Getty's former curator of antiquities, who is accused of acquiring objects illegally excavated from Italian soil. The Getty bought the statue in 1988 for a reported $18 million from the London-based dealer Robin Symes. Salvatore Morando, an investigator testifying at yesterday's hearing, asserted that it came from an illegal excavation at Morgantina in central Sicily. Mr. Morando said tests on the statue and on fragments found at Morgantina indicated that ""they came from the same archaeological site."" Italian officials have asked for more tests, but Maurizio Fiorilli, a lawyer for the state, charged in court that the Getty Museum was uncooperative. Lawyers for Mrs. True countered that many experts, including Malcolm Bell, a director of the excavations at the Sicilian site, say that no proof of the statue's origins is known. Italian officials have contended since 1988 that it was illegally taken from Sicily. ELISABETTA POVOLEDO",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/arts/science/arts-briefly-getty-goddess-conflict.html

2006-02-09,"‘Munich,’ Reconsidered and Repackaged","By now, the Bagger thinks we can all agree that “Munich” was rolled out with all the grace and beauty of a ship that started to sink after it was christened with a bottle of champagne. Bad P.R., bad ads, and bad vibe, all rolled into one. And yet, and yet, it was nominated as one of the five best pictures of the year. So, the folks behind the film, having been granted some oxygen by the nomination, are going to give selling Steven Spielberg’s movie another whack. There are new print ads that could not help but be an improvement over the original ad, left: The silhouette of a lone figure certainly brought a lot of mood to bear, a mood that suggests the guy might be about to cut his own wrists. As Rachel Abramowitz of the Los Angeles Times pointed out, marketing the movie as a SERIOUS, IMPORTANT FILM probably wounded its prospects a lot more than the ack-ack it picked up from people on either side of the Middle East debate. The new ads show some beefy, trained-to-maim dudes that would not be out of place in, ah, an action-packed thriller. The marketplace, and by proxy, Hollywood, is a place where do-overs aren’t usually handed out, but “Munich’s” substantial appeal with members of the Academy – whether it is mostly homage to Mr. Spielberg’s storied career or not – has given this movie another shot.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/munich-reconsidered-and-repackaged/

2006-02-09,Black and White and Pasted All Over,"Mebbe it is just the Bagger, but do the ads for this year’s Oscar contain a semiotic pitch for “Good Night, and Good Luck”? Look at the male version of the ad, which can be seen on billboards around L.A. right now. You have a suited male, face unseen, rendered in black and white. The only color in the picture comes from the golden guy himself. You don’t have to squint your eyes too much to start thinking the classically attired male torso might be that of David Strathairn, George Clooney, or even Edward R. Murrow. Perhaps the Bagger’s blood sugar is running a bit high and muddling his thinking, but now that he has put that little thought in your head, see if you ever look at the ad the same way again.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/black-and-white-and-pasted-all-over/
2006-02-09,Credit Score,"Sometimes when things slow down, the Bagger does his best thinking. Not that he is going to go all Mensa on you, but you know what they say about idle hands. Fer instance, a while back we did a story about the scrum over credits, and now that the ballots are shipping, it’s worth revisiting. On one level, the fight over who gets credit for “Crash” is all of the worst of Hollywood – pettiness, ego, avarice – in one untidy multi-car pileup. On another, very real issues are at stake. On one side is the Producers Guild of Anerica and, by proxy, the Academy, seeking to control credit creep, in which everybody and his brother can say they produced a film. On the other, you have people like Bob Yari and Mark Harris, two of the guys who got stiffed in the new process of determining who gets actual credit come Oscar time, wondering who appointed these guys as arbiters of all that is good and holy in the production process. As indie productions grow and become a mainstay of the both the business and the aesthetic of the industry, movies are going to continue to come together in a complicated way. Mr. Yari has already sued one of his former production partners on “Crash,” not just over the credit issue, but that certainly is one of the salient issues. Mr. Yari has made noises about actually going ahead and suing the Producers Guild, but that brings up a rather delicate issue. Mr. Yari continues to be financially staked in “Crash,” and will benefit significantly if the movie ends up sneaking in as best picture. So, with that broader objective in mind, he and anybody else involved in “Crash” wants to get the Academy’s attention. And suing the hand that feeds them, while it will accomplish that goal, will not endear the membership when “Crash” needs all the friends it can get.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/credit-score/
2006-02-09,Moment of Truth,"With ballots beginning to land all over town, members of the Academy are looking over the list and realizing just how many movies they have to actually see to credibly vote in all of the categories. And if they are being the least bit honest with themselves, they will look in the mirror and say, “That isn’t going to happen.” They will make a valiant effort, churning their way through several films, but eventually, they will succumb to reality and pull the trigger in some categories they know very little about. The Bagger has always said that democracy – especially as practiced by elites – is a very blunt technology.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/moment-of-truth/
2006-02-09,Secret Agents,"Gail Berman, the president of Paramount, has complained that she is getting mau-maued by a bunch of underinformed bloggers, but more than the blogosphere is chattering about how fleeting her hold on the job might be. Brad Grey, head of Paramount, offered a remarkably wan defense in Laura Holson’s piece in The Times this week. Mr. Grey said Ms. Berman had his support so far. “She’s working hard and it’s early,” he said. Some have suggested that Ari Emmanuel of the Endeavor agency will be brought in to help run the place in Ms. Berman’s stead. That would mean that the Dreamworks guys have managed to reverse the polarity on the sale of Dreamworks’ live-action unit to Paramount, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Co. dictating what the new team will look like.

He also knew he didn’t want more criticism about being racist and insensitive, after the raking over the coals he got for the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

At stake is the political leadership of the Satmar Hasidim -- a voting bloc of more than 50,000 -- and control of a vast network of real estate and social services. The ruling, by Acting Justice Stewart A. Rosenwasser of State Supreme Court in Orange County, addressed a question of access to a cemetery in Monroe. But to decide the issue, he wrote that he must first resolve the question of which faction rightfully controls corporate decision-making.

But in Grand Forks, a town of about 50,000 closer to Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis, winter is not a forbidding season. There's plenty to do outdoors if you're up for it, but because Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota and its more than 13,000 students, there's a surprising number of things to do indoors as well. The people are remarkably friendly, perhaps the result of working together to hold back the Red River of the North, which last flooded in 1997 and would have destroyed the city were it not for the legions of hyperorganized volunteer sandbaggers. And while a majority of the inhabitants trace their ancestry to Norway or Germany, the Forks has grown more diverse with the increasing number of university students from overseas. Finally, consider the joke that Grand Forks played on Dave Barry when he ridiculed the city's efforts to promote tourism. Lured to the Forks by a postcard-writing campaign, he was the guest of honor at an official ceremony in 2002-- in which a municipal sewage pump station was named after him.

2006-02-10,The Listings: Feb. 10 - Feb. 16; 'PITTSBURGH: FROM THE HEART OF STEELTOWN',"It's a happy accident that this Jazz at Lincoln Center minifestival arrives in the lingering afterglow of Super Bowl XL, which yielded the first Pittsburgh Steelers championship since their glory days a quarter-century ago. ""Pittsburgh: From the Heart of Steeltown"" is the latest in a series of concert events celebrating the jazz legacy of American cities, by way of Wynton Marsalis, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and a handful of special guests. It's a simple and effective premise for the kind of repertory work that the Lincoln Center orchestra does best; performing at the Rose Theater, it will tackle crisp, serious arrangements united by theme rather than style. The evening's Pittsburgh-reared guest stars will be Steve Nelson, a patiently exploratory vibraphonist, and Jeff Watts, known as Tain, a brilliantly locomotive drummer. Some of the Steel City's more famous jazz heroes, like the pianist Earl Hines, nicknamed Fatha, and the composer and pianist Billy Strayhorn, will be represented in the program's repertory. (The absence of living legends like the guitarist George Benson and the pianist Ahmad Jamal is a shortcoming that Mr. Marsalis, in his capacity as M.C., should manage to overcome.) A smaller and more single-minded tribute, in memory of another Pittsburgh native, the tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine (above), who died in 2000, will run simultaneously in the Allen Room. Eric Alexander and Robert Stewart will handle tenor saxophone duties, and the rhythm section will consist of Gene Ludwig on Hammond B3 organ, Dave Stryker on guitar and Grady Tate on drums. Appropriately, the music will recall a time just before the Steelers reigned supreme. (Thursday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.jalc.org; $30 to $130.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/arts/movies/the-listings-feb-10-feb-16-pittsburgh-from-the-heart-of.html

2006-02-10,'The Fallen Idol',"Graham Greene liked to say that he preferred ""The Fallen Idol"" (1948) to the more famous ""The Third Man"" (1949) because it was more a writer's film than a director's. It's hard not to wonder if he actually favored ""The Fallen Idol,"" which he adapted from his story ""The Basement Room"" and was, like ""The Third Man,"" directed by Carol Reed, because Orson Welles wasn't on hand, grabbing the spotlight. Whatever the case, while Greene is probably in a minority in preferring ""The Fallen Idol,"" this eccentric curio certainly has its appeal. The streamlined plot involves a young boy, his family's butler and the butler's secrets, and follows the original story in outline, deviating in detail (the boy in the film has a pet snake), if not dark tone. Ralph Richardson plays Baines, a butler for an embassy family in London who works alongside his wife (the ferocious Sonia Dresdel), but loves another (Michèle Morgan). The film opens just as the ambassador departs on a short trip, leaving his only son, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey, above), alone with the Baineses and their violently unhappy marriage. Beautifully shot by the French cinematographer Georges Périnal (whose credits include Cocteau's ""Blood of a Poet""), the film soon evolves from a claustrophobic domestic affair into a mordantly discomfiting look at the betrayal of innocence. In his story, Greene writes that the boy ""didn't understand a thing; he was caught up in other people's darkness."" Reed captures both the writer's intentions and the child's panicked isolation in a scene that finds Phillipe fleeing through city streets as steeped in shadow and dread as those in the noirs of Anthony Mann. As the film's putatively happy (and strange) windup makes it clear, when childhood ends, there really is no place left to run. (""The Fallen Idol"" runs today through Feb. 23 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/movies/the-fallen-idol.html

2006-02-10,The Listings: Feb. 10 - Feb. 16; 'FRIANDISES',"Choreographers are often drawn to the same pieces of music -- the Bach solo cello suites and Stravinsky's ""Sacre du Printemps"" are just two examples among many -- but it's hard to think of a musical commission that has been specifically made to be used by more than one choreographer. That's the case with a new composition, ""Friandises,"" (French for sweets) by Christopher Rouse, commissioned by the Juilliard School and the New York City Ballet, which will perform Peter Martins's ballet -- named after the score -- for the first time tonight. (Adam Houghland's ""Watershed,"" to the same score, will be performed by the Juilliard Dance Ensemble, beginning on Feb. 22.) ""I think it was cheaper for everyone that way,"" said Mr. Rouse (above right, with Mr. Martins), an acclaimed composer who also teaches at Juilliard. Mr. Rouse had long wanted to write a piece of music specifically for dance, after seeing a number of his works used by choreographers. He knew Mr. Martins, who had made a powerful duo, ""The Infernal Machine,"" to his score of the same title, in 2002, and they began to talk about the possibility just as Juilliard raised the idea of a commission for its centenary celebration. ""We agreed that it would be interesting to have a co-commission,"" Mr. Martins said. ""Although quite frankly, I wasn't thrilled at the idea of having Adam and myself doing pieces at the same time, because it makes it competitive. But then I decided not to worry about it."" Although Mr. Rouse has subsequently seen rehearsals, he had little contact with the choreographers while creating the score; he simply told them that it would contain five movements of around five minutes each. City Ballet's musical director, Andrea Quinn, is conducting both the City Ballet and Juilliard performances, and Mr. Rouse is leaving issues of tempo up to her. ""I'm staying out of it,"" he said. ""I did my thing, and now they will do theirs.""

'American Idol' Rolls","If Kelly Clarkson's ""American Idol"" luster had rubbed off on the Grammy Awards, she might have prevented the ceremony's broadcast from achieving its second-lowest ratings ever. The telecast, during which Ms. Clarkson, below, the first ""American Idol"" winner, won two Grammy Awards, drew an estimated 17.56 million viewers in prime time, down from last year's low-rated telecast. According to Nielsen's estimates, those ratings for CBS were good enough for only a second-place finish, behind Fox, in total viewers and adults 18 to 49. ""American Idol,"" which delivered an estimated 28.29 million viewers, fueled Fox's victory. During the 8 p.m. time period, ""Idol"" beat the Grammys' first hour by more than 13 million viewers. And at 9 p.m., the awards ceremony was challenged by ABC's ""Lost"" (18.78 million). The island mystery featured a power play by Sawyer (Josh Holloway), who turned the testosterone tables on Jack (Matthew Fox) and Locke (Terry O'Quinn).

But in Grand Forks, a town of about 50,000 closer to Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis, winter is not a forbidding season. There's plenty to do outdoors if you're up for it, but because Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota and its more than 13,000 students, there's a surprising number of things to do indoors as well. The people are remarkably friendly, perhaps the result of working together to hold back the Red River of the North, which last flooded in 1997 and would have destroyed the city were it not for the legions of hyperorganized volunteer sandbaggers. And while a majority of the inhabitants trace their ancestry to Norway or Germany, the Forks has grown more diverse with the increasing number of university students from overseas. Finally, consider the joke that Grand Forks played on Dave Barry when he ridiculed the city's efforts to promote tourism. Lured to the Forks by a postcard-writing campaign, he was the guest of honor at an official ceremony in 2002— in which a municipal sewage pump station was named after him.

No. 1, the biggest news of the night seemed to be that one of the attendees showed up in her underwear. It is also worth noting that contests may be trumping awards in the minds of the American viewer. When a game show full of no-name performers (“American Idol”) doubles up the audience on the recording industry’s night of stars, glamour and hardware, the Bagger has to wonder if people are just plain turned off by the routine. Maybe it’s good that the Academy is switching it up this year because the same old, same old does not appear to be cutting it. And as the night wore on, the Grammys offered an object lesson in the illusion of momentum, something that is breathlessly invoked come Oscar time. Early in the night, it was all Mariah and Mimi, making it appear as if the diva’s comeback would include a sweep of the Grammys. But by the end of the night, the smoke had cleared and it was U2 hauling away the most hardware. It is a reminder, one the Bagger will tuck under his pillow and sleep on for the next few weeks, that the story can change, even in the course of a single evening.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/into-the-long-dark-part-of-the-night/

A few years ago, the Bagger had the opportunity to go to Fashion Week trailing Anna Wintour, which is a little like going to the Oscars with Julia Roberts, except Ms. Wintour doesn’t do that fake smile thing. He felt as if he had landed on the surface of the moon, surrounded as he was by silly model walks, madly vogue-ing wannabes, and some nasty asides from the carefully attired peanut gallery.

The Bush administration’s rationale for war, Pillar writes, was based not on weapons of mass destruction but by “the desire to shake up the sclerotic power structures of the Middle East and hasten the spread of more liberal politics and economics in the region.” Therefore, focusing on the intelligence community’s mistaken belief that Saddam Hussein possessed W.M.D. misses the point, because the “intelligence of Iraqi weapons programs did not drive [the administration’s] decision to go to war.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/former-cia-official-the-misuse-of-intelligence/

2006-02-13,BUSINESS BRIEFS,"Visteon Posts a Fourth-Quarter Profit, Helped by the Sale of Assets to Ford The auto parts maker Visteon Corporation posted a quarterly net profit yesterday after recognizing a gain of $1.83 billion on the sale of plants and other facilities to its former parent, the Ford Motor Company. Visteon reported net income of $1.34 billion, or $10.25 a share, for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a net loss of $138 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter sales fell to $2.87 billion, from $4.68 billion a year earlier, mainly because of the sale of operations to Ford. Excluding the gain and other one-time items, Visteon reported a loss of $102 million in the quarter. The deal with Ford helped Visteon avoid falling into bankruptcy. Production cuts and price reductions in North America hurt quarterly results for Visteon, which was spun off by Ford in 2000.

Richard Michelson's Happy Feet: The Savoy Ballroom Lindy Hoppers and Me (Gulliver/Harcourt, $16; ages 5 to 8) captures the Savoy's opening night, on March 12, 1926, through stories told by a father to his son. Young readers may need help understanding the jumps in time, from the boy's birth that same night (earning him the nickname ""Happy Feet"") to his work in his father's shoeshine shop across the street some years later, but they will delight in playful slang like ""hep cats"" and ""jelly on the cuff"" (meaning ""no charge""). In E. B. Lewis's exuberant watercolors, shop scenes in shades of brown are juxtaposed with the wild, blue-toned dance floor, where dresses and suits swirl and blur. An author's note explains that the Savoy -- which closed in 1958 -- was among the first integrated ballrooms, and brief biographies shed light on famous Lindy Hoppers mentioned in the story, like ""Long-Legged George"" Grenidge, known for the Long-Legged Charleston, and six-foot-tall Big Bea, who liked to flip her partner, Shorty George.

2006-02-13,The Heartland Dissident,"With a bluntness that seems habitual -- and more than occasionally strikes fellow Republicans as disloyal -- Senator Chuck Hagel started voicing skepticism about the Bush administration's fixation on Iraq as a place to fight the Global War on Terror more than half a year before the president gave the go-ahead for the assault. What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force -- he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand -- he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: ""How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets."" The president had said ""precious little"" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, ""in both American blood and treasure.""",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/magazine/the-heartland-dissident.html

Fruit trees were induced to bloom earlier or later, their fruit sweeter or different in size, smell, and shape from the typical. In the island's parks and enclosed pastures, all sorts of beasts and birds resided for purposes more experimental than ornamental: ""We make them greater or taller than their kind,"" stated the great ""Father"" scientist in charge. ""We find means to make commixtures and copulations of different kinds; which have produced many new kinds."" Yet despite the marvelous specificity of his vision, Bacon did not offer a date for the actual start of these transformative practices. For when The New Atlantis was published in 1627, a year after Bacon's death, making one plant or animal turn into another was still the stuff of imaginary islands and magically endowed inhabitants.

This seems surprising, given that for some years the wearing of fur was arguably the consumer ethics issue. Anti-fur activism had a very high profile, and was presumably one reason that the production of mink skins, for instance, plummeted by more than 50 percent between 1988 and 1993, according to Oslo Fur Auctions Ltd. Last year, mink production was close to 1980's peak levels again.

Much of ""The Inheritance of Loss"" takes place in a town near Mount Kanchenjunga that Mishra recognized from his own travels. But Desai's Kalimpong is ""much bigger and more diverse"" than the village of Mashobra, where Mishra first settled in 1992 and where he has returned every year for long spells of reading and writing and, he confessed, ""worrying about writing."" In Mashobra, he began the work of memoir, history and philosophy that would become ""An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World"" (2004) and worked on his novel, ""The Romantics"" (2000), about a young Indian's encounters with Westerners studying his country's ancient culture. His next book will be ""Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet, and Beyond."" As for the complex view of modernity in Desai's novel, Mishra drew a comparison with the film ""Syriana,"" since both works, although very different, vividly depict what he called ""the multilayered interdependent world we live in,"" a place ""where individual lives very far apart in space and time impact upon one another,"" sometimes with tragic results.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/up-front.html

Adored ""Pop"" to grandchildren Hilary, Matthew, Gwen, Keshia and Jonathan. Sadly missed by Millie. Jim was born in Montreal on March 17, 1935 but grew up in New Rochelle, New York where his father Alex was Administrator of New Rochelle Hospital. A 1957 graduate of Williams College, Jim returned to Canada where he was an economist with the Government of Canada, an International Representative for the United Steelworkers and Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at Brock University. Following his election to North York Council and the Metropolitan Toronto Council, Jim embarked on a consulting career that bridged both sides of the border and spanned over thirty years. A specialist in the field of managed healthcare, Jim left his mark on the industry and those within it, as both a visionary and a friend. Upon retirement, Jim established his own consulting company, aptly titled, Kris Kringle. As candidate, active campaigner and vigilant supporter of The New Democratic Party Jim remained a life-long crusader for social Justice. A rare mix of success and generosity, Jim regularly volunteered at the ""Out of the Cold"" soup kitchen. Jim Norton was many things to many people: a husband, a father, a grandfather, a teacher, a colleague and a friend.

What the senator said in public was milder than what he said in private conversations with foreign-policy gurus like Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in another Bush administration, or his friend Colin Powell, the secretary of state, who thought he still had a chance to steer the administration on a diplomatic course. The Nebraskan wanted to believe Powell but, deep down, felt the White House wasn't going to be diverted from its drive to topple Saddam Hussein. When he rose on the Senate floor that October to explain his vote in favor of the resolution authorizing force — he'd persuaded himself that his vote might strengthen Powell's hand — he gave a speech that would have required no editing had he decided to vote against it. What sounded then to the venture's true believers like the scolding of a Cassandra sounds fairly obvious three and a half years later, which is to say that Hagel's words can reasonably be read as prescient: ""How many of us really know and understand Iraq, its country, history, people and role in the Arab world?. . .The American people must be told of the long-term commitment, risk and cost of this undertaking. We should not be seduced by the expectations of dancing in the streets."" The president had said ""precious little"" about post-Saddam Iraq, which could prove costly, Hagel warned, ""in both American blood and treasure.""",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/magazine/12hagel.html

2006-02-13,Go For Two?,"If a national Foot ball League executive wanted to devise a perfect ending to the Super Bowl, it would look like the finale of the Week 10 shootout between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Washington Redskins. The Buccaneers scored in the final minute and needed only to kick the extra point to tie the game and send it into overtime. But when an offside penalty negated a block kick and nudged his team to the 1-yard line from the 2, head coach Jon Gruden went for the 2-point conversion, a rare move under normal circumstances and almost unheard of late in a game. (Only once before had a N.F.L. game been won by a last-minute 2-point conversion.) Gruden's decision was successful - his team won, 36-35 - and significant for both teams. It kept the Bucs in playoff contention and sent the ""Skins into a tailspin: they lost two more games and had to win their last five to make the playoffs (where they exacted revenge on the Bucs in the first round).

2006-02-13,A BAN ON HARVESTING CRABS,"The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection last week banned the harvesting of horseshoe crabs in the state for the next two years. The ban, which is scheduled to take effect in May, is primarily aimed at allowing red knots, birds that migrate through New Jersey between Canada and the Southern Hemisphere, to fatten up on horseshoe crab eggs during their long flight. The red knots are near extinction, and environmentalists think a moratorium on harvesting horseshoe crabs will improve chances for survival. Normally, horseshoe crabs are used for bait or fertilizer and are found primarily along the Delaware Bay and the southern New Jersey shore. The ruling by the D.E.P. allows for horseshoe crabs to be captured for medical uses. Some researchers think that horseshoe crab blood helps keep vaccines and other drugs free of contamination. Since the extraction of the blood does not necessarily kill the crab, the D.E.P. thought it was safe to allow that use.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/nyregion/briefs-environment-a-ban-on-harvesting-crabs.html

2006-02-13,No Credit Assignment,"Speaking of “Crash,” Bob Yari has lost his bid to be listed as one of the producers of the film. John Horn writes that last Thursday, the Academy rejected an appeal by Mr. Yari, who had claimed that he was unfairly denied credit for his role in making the film. The Academy was following recommendations of the Producers Guild, which has sought to reduce the number of listed producers on various projects. The guild believes that handing out production credits as deal points devalues the contributions of people who actually did the work. Mr. Yari and Mark Harris, who was also denied a credit, believe the Producer’s Guild has little knowledge of how independent movies actually come together in the modern era of film-making. All of the fuss is an attempt to avoid the kind of traffic jam that occurred when “Shakespeare in Love” won at the 1999 ceremony, with a total of five producers heading up to the stage to make a grab for the Oscar and the limelight. Mr. Horn points out that “Crash” was not the only movie in which credits were an issue; under the Producers Guild’s more vigorously enforced standards, Colin Wilson was cut as a producer for “Munich.” The Academy now limits to three the number of listed producers.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/13/no-credit-assignment/

Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune points out that the movie went over hill and dale to get financing, with no one willing to step up to the plate until Don Cheadle finally signed on to star. And even then, the film sparked wildly different critical responses, hardly the sort of vitae you’d expect for one of the leading contenders for best film. The story itself is something of a fever dream.

Josh Evans, a New York auctioneer at Leland’s, said peddling an Oscar is tough duty. “I don’t see how it’s possible,” he said. “It’s almost like buying the Mona Lisa — no, like that painting ‘The Scream.’ There’s no or little value, or even underground value. It’s too famous.” Every time the Bagger looks at an Oscar, the Mona Lisa comes to mind.

The air marshals, Shawn R. Nguyen and Burlie L. Sholar, were arrested Thursday, and the police said they recovered the cocaine from Mr. Nguyen's residence along with what they described as partial payment of a bribe for the smuggling. The authorities also said that in December, Mr. Nguyen, 38, used his position to circumvent airport security and transport $25,000 in illegal drug proceeds as well as bogus government documents. He and Mr. Sholar, 32, could each be fined $4 million and be sentenced to life prison terms if convicted.

2006-02-14,Fares at Dulles,"FARES AT DULLES -- Many analysts predicted that the collapse of the discount carrier Independence Air last month would lead to higher airfares at Dulles International Airport near Washington. The airport had some of the highest average fares in the nation before Independence Air began operating there in 2004, forcing competitors to lower ticket prices. Over all, fares have not gone up much since Independence Air closed on Jan. 5, industry analysts say. But on flights in which passengers depart and return on the same day, once a staple of Independence Air's short-haul network, ticket prices have risen significantly, said Terry Trippler, the airfare analyst at Cheapseats.com. When Independence Air folded, he found, the round-trip fare for same-day flights between Dulles and Buffalo on United Airlines was $158. A month later, it had risen to $618. Dulles to Pittsburgh went to $900, from $78, on United and to $900, from $228, on US Airways.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/business/fares-at-dulles.html

Iraq's move is certain to please American wheat farmers. U.S. Wheat Associates, a trade association representing American wheat growers, had urged the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to take similar action after Mr. Hussein was toppled in 2003, and has led an effort to have AWB investigated. The Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, called Iraq's action ""regrettable given that Australia has been a reliable supplier of high quality wheat to Iraq for many years.""

Under the plan, energy exports would be blocked, energy imports would be stepped up and gas supplies could be cut off to some major customers, he said. Earlier yesterday, the Italian oil and gas company Eni said it expected natural gas supplies to Italy from Russia to be 16.2 percent below requested volumes for the 24-hour period starting that morning.

Focus Features, which has the prohibitive favorite in “Brokeback Mountain,” is a division of Universal, so it would seem odd for a company to spend money competing with itself. But perhaps studio execs are unimpressed by “Brokeback’s” homestretch and want to hedge a bit. And they may be miffed that so many specialty divisions and indies are ruling what has been a historically a big party of the big guys. The Bagger wonders whether the folks at Universal sense an opening – sure, they would like “Brokeback” to do well. But if the talk that it may not go all the way is more than that, well, if not BB, then why not Munich? It is an Important Film, by an Important Director — Steven Spielberg — and written by one of the most Important Playwrights of Our Time – Tony Kushner. Mr. Kushner told CNN that when people go to the movie house, they are expecting more than a bag of popcorn: “We’re living in very fraught, complicated times, and I think that when we live in times like these, that people expect their entertainment, as well as their newspapers, to help them think their way through things,” said Mr. Kushner.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/munich-makes-a-move/
2006-02-14,"Shoot First, Talk Much, Much Later","It’s not every day the vice president shoots a man and then decides not to tell the public about it for almost 24 hours. Simple accident or symbol of a White House culture of secrecy? Count the Washington Post editorial page among those in the latter camp: “Saturday’s incident required immediate public disclosure — a fact so elementary that the failure to act properly is truly disturbing in its implications.” On the Post’s op-ed page, columnist Eugene Robinson sees Cheney’s hunting accident as a metaphor for the Bush administration’s foreign policy as well: “The man is out of control. Then again, out-of-control is the way this whole administration operates: Ready, fire, aim. Global war on terrorism, global war on poultry, what’s the difference? You see something moving, shoot it.” (The Times editorial page says the White House “once again demonstrated that it would rather look inept than open.”) ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/shoot-first-talk-much-much-later/

The court's five-judge panel said in a 20-page opinion that the charge was without merit. Mr. Tsvangirai's party, Movement for Democratic Change, has since been riven by internal bickering; its two factions will hold separate conventions in a few weeks to elect new leaders.

2006-02-15,Gonzaga Gagged,"“Brokeback Mountain” has entered the popular lexicon in all sorts of ways. Just yesterday, one of the rugrats directly addressed the Bagger in the comments section with a paraphrase from the film: “I wish you could quit Dave Poland.” But the movie as meme has struck in other ways, which may in fact be less funny. Apparently, some of the fans of the No. 5 Gonzaga basketball team have been chanting “Brokeback Mountain” to infer that the other team, well, plays for the other team. Officials at the Jesuit school have asked the fans to put a lid on the chant, although the Bagger heard that the chant had also cropped up at one of the better high schools in Los Angeles as well. Writing in the Gonzaga school paper, one student put it thusly: ",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/gonzaga-gagged/

Mr. Hessinger immediately retained – you guessed it, Bert Fields – and a nasty court case seemed in the offing, but SAG has apparently negotiated a truce.

Given Mr. Fields’ historical hand-in-glove relationship with Mr. Pellicano, his many star clients are no doubt wondering whether they will get pulled in one way or another. According to a story by my colleagues David M. Halbfinger and Allison Hope Weiner, much of the investigation so far has centered on Mr. Pellicano’s relationship with Michael S.

2006-02-15,"Oscar Bump? Nah, Oscar Slump","We all know that in addition to parceling out the highest honors in American filmmaking, the Oscars tend to generate big chunks of cash. The so-called “Oscar bump” can be good for $5 million or $10 million, or even more, a windfall of cash at the box office that rewards those who made good films and ran good campaigns behind them. But the Bagger has been spending some quality time on Box Office Mojo and, more worrisome, with his own calculator. And what he’s found is that this year, there will be no Oscar bump – far from it. The tale of the box office tape suggests that the Oscar sparkle will do little for the long-term business outlook of this year’s best picture nominees. True enough, the four still in theatrical release – “Brokeback Mountain,” “Munich,” “Good Night, and Good Luck,” and “Capote” — got a bit of a push the week after nominations were announced. They went from a collective weekend gross of $8.9 million before the announcements to $11.5 million the weekend after. But then they went right off the cliff. Last weekend, the carnage was everywhere. The four films (“Crash” came out earlier in the year and is only on DVD) were down a collective 43.4 percent from the previous weekend and took in just about $6.9 million. In other words, they were worse off than before the Oscars. “Brokeback” is still in almost 2,000 theaters and took in a robust $4 million, but “Munich” lost 600 screens, better than half its theaters, and took in a miserable $783,510. Given the level of heat and promotion behind the movie, it is clear that not many besides Academy members are taking Steven Spielberg up on his suggestion that people ignore the partisans and see the movie for themselves. “Capote,” which recently crept over the $20 million mark, took in $1.27 million while “Good Night, and Good Luck,” did $872,000.

2006-02-16,World Business Briefing | Americas: Mexico: Economy Slowed in Fourth Quarter,"Mexico's economic expansion slowed in the fourth quarter as consumer demand remained slack and hurricanes wiped out some bean, sugar and corn crops.

For the full year, Mexico expanded 3 percent, down from a revised growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2004. ""The economy is just kind of treading water,"" said Neil Dougall, chief of emerging markets research for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. Sluggish growth among manufacturers that sell primarily in the domestic market suggests that consumption has yet to pick up after six interest-rate cuts by the central bank, Mr. Dougall said. That will most likely prompt central bankers to keep cutting the benchmark lending rate, bringing it down to 7 percent by year-end from a 15-month low of 7.75 percent now, he said. The Finance Ministry forecasts growth will quicken to 3.6 percent this year as the interest-rate reductions bolster demand.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/business/world-business-briefing-americas-mexico-economy-slowed-in-fourth.html

The fabrics here are available at the D & D Building, 979 Third Avenue (59th Street), to the trade only, but there is a service for people without decorators; (212) 759-6894.

At 9 p.m., Fox's ""House"" drew 20 million viewers and won the 18-to-49 demographic for the hour. But NBC managed to scratch its way ahead in viewers, with 20.8 million tuning in to Johnny Weir's skating performance and Bode Miller's disqualification from the men's combination skiing event.

2006-02-17,The Listings: Feb. 17 - Feb. 23; JOE BRADLEY: 'KURGAN WAVES',"In art, pretending to be dumber, more juvenile or less rational than you are usually serves an advanced sophistication. It certainly does in the surprisingly sweet and mysteriously resonant exhibition by Joe Bradley, a young New York-based painter having his third solo show. Mr. Bradley's multipanel paintings consist of flimsy, store-bought canvases brusquely painted single colors and arranged to create the much simplified images of armless, big-shouldered figures resembling primitive video game characters. Standing almost nine feet, with their legs abutting the floor, these ""big blocky guys,"" as the sculptor Dike Blair calls them in an essay written for the exhibition, seem to have gathered for some kind of tribal ceremony. A sky-blue canvas called ""Mirror,"" lying on the stone floor in the center of the gallery, glows like a reflecting pool; a large, squarish canvas on the wall, painted all brown, evokes the earth (above from left ""Trans,"" ""Mirror"" and ""Machine Hash""). (That Kurgan is the name of an evil, immortal warrior in the cult movie ""Highlander"" may or may not be relevant.) To use a Minimalist vocabulary for such unabashedly anthropomorphic purposes is somehow comical. Joel Shapiro's blocky, puppetlike figures are similarly funny. Mr. Bradley's show might be a joke about what the critic Michael Fried saw as the essentially theatrical nature of Minimalist art. But it also vividly demonstrates how we may experience even the most abstract artworks as animated by life-like or supernatural energies. We may not be as sophisticated as we think. (Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 4.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/17/arts/movies/the-listings-feb-17-feb-23-joe-bradley-kurgan-waves.html

2006-02-17,The Listings: Feb. 17 - Feb. 23; GARY WILMES,"Ever since he croaked out an indie-rock song in the middle of Richard Maxwell's deadpan epic ""House"" in 1998, Gary Wilmes has been cursed with the label of avant-garde star -- which is a little like being called a tall midget. The lanky Mr. Wilmes has stolen scenes in a handful of plays by Mr. Maxwell, with whom he went to high school, and was also hailed by critics for his twitchy turn as the title character in Richard Foreman's ""Bad Boy Nietzsche."" His forays into more traditional theater, like his cameo role in ""More Lies About Jerzy"" at the Vineyard Theater, were mostly ignored. But that's not the case with his devilish performance as a self-absorbed and cruel Manhattan editor in Adam Rapp's ""Red Light Winter,"" an involving play that nicely captures the casually misogynistic banter of overeducated postgraduate dudes. Mr. Wilmes (above, with Lisa Joyce), an athletic presence whose jangly limbs seem to follow the rest of his body across the stage, looks a little old for the part, but his laid-back adolescent arrogance is just right. And while this turn is in a realistic style, look closely enough and you'll notice something oddly unpredictable and ominous about his line readings. He pauses for longer than you expect, and when he cracks a mean joke, he never cracks a smile, as if he's still performing the distinctively flat dialogue of Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Wilmes may have crossed over to more conventional theater, but he has smuggled a bit of the avant-garde with him.

""August Wilson is dear to our hearts,"" said Neil Barclay, the president and chief executive of the center. ""We're trying to break out of the museum model and talk about our experience in a more holistic way. Not only was August Wilson a great literary figure, but his work is informed by jazz and visual artists like Romare Bearden, so he is an iconic figure who represents that holistic approach.""

2006-02-17,'Worldy Desires',"The young Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul knows better than most one of the trickiest parts of his art: how much to impose his imaginative design on the world, and when to let life flow, raw and unmediated, full of all its quirks and longueurs, into his camera. His sly feature debut, ""Mysterious Object at Noon"" (2001), was a documentary about rural Thailand that played like a surrealist folktale. ""Blissfully Yours"" (2002) led a group of nonprofessionals into the jungle for an avant-garde picnic, fixing naturalistic actions into highly self-conscious structures. His deliriously inventive ""Tropical Malady"" (2005) developed this hybrid instinct to such a degree that it spoke with equal authority on the textures of everyday life in Thailand and the desires of a lovesick, shape-shifting tiger shaman. Each of Mr. Weerasethakul's films is an exploration of storytelling, a (head) trip into uncharted narrative terrain. His latest work, the digital short ""Worldly Desires"" (above), is the most meta of his movies, and perhaps the most enigmatic. The story is once again set in a Thai jungle thick with vegetation and metamorphic energies -- but precisely what sort of story is as ambiguous as ever. There is a film shoot in progress, and the staging of a peppy musical number, but the camera keeps wandering off to stare at the trees or look at a stray dog or linger near some casual talk.(""The only foreigner I like is Keanu."") Is this an experimental documentary on the making of Mr. Weerasethakul's new feature? Or has the whole crazy, unclassifiable thing -- imagine a cross between ""Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take 1"" and a painting by Henri Rousseau -- been invented from scratch? ""Worldly Desires"" is another mysterious object, blissfully ours.

The eight-week run at the State Theater concludes next weekend, but there's still time to catch a few role debuts, a rare appearance by the longtime principal Kyra Nichols (above right, rehearsing with Susan Stroman) and a Balanchine ballet or two. All of the remaining programs end with his works, including ""Western Symphony,"" ""Union Jack"" and ""Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet."" (Ms. Nichols is to perform in the first movement of this 1966 ballet on Feb. 25.) The final week will also include four performances of Jerome Robbins's 1951 ballet ""The Cage,"" set to Stravinsky and recently likened to ""looking through a keyhole"" into the dancers' world by the ballet master Jean-Pierre Frohlich. If you're more interested in taking a peek at newer works, there will be two performances each of the resident choreographer Christopher Wheeldon's ""Scènes de Ballet,"" first performed in 1999, and last year's rapturously received ""After the Rain.""

Would you risk your life the way Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch) and a tiny group of fellow students at Munich University did to spread antigovernment leaflets? How would you behave during the kind of relentless interrogations that Sophie endures? If sentenced to death for your activities, would you still consider your resistance to have been worth it?

A spokeswoman for Ukraine's security services said in a telephone interview that a court in Crimea had ordered their deportation, apparently without allowing them to appeal.

No chain stores or overabundance of T-shirt shops mar the town's singular appeal.

It was one of those little jets and the flight attendant was casting worried looks in his direction, but the Bagger stayed immersed in his iPod, transfixed by Steve Carell’s antics. And now word comes that Mr. Carell, in addition to Nicole Kidman and Will Smith, will get some podium time at the Oscars. Now, the Bagger is not so gob-smacked on the Oscars that he is unwilling to admit that much of the evening seems short on suspense and gravitas, but between Mr. Carell, Terrence Howard, and host Jon Stewart, it could be a fun night by turns.

2006-02-17,The Other Brother,"Lots of people have been making cracks about the pictures in the Vanity Fair Hollywood issue, so the Bagger picked up a copy himself. The Bagger noticed a trussed-up Peter Sarsgaard, a VERY relaxed Sienna Miller, the ever-freakish old soul/new kid on the block Dakota Fanning, and lots of nekkid people. The Bagger is the kind of guy who showers with his shirt on, so he admires the courage of people who are willing to do all sorts of sharing with their public. But the most impressive picture for the Bagger was one entitled “The Warriors.” The image is not available online, so the Bagger, through precision use of his craft and well-chosen words, will do his best. There is a picture of Harvey Weinstein. Harvey looks good. It’s not the fake Harvey, the jolly smile that he gets just before he is about to devour your soul. This was Harvey looking tough, smart, and yes, down to his fighting weight. Harvey was flanked by a very debonair businessman, a handsome guy whose face was writ with intelligence, a kind of executive warmth, and quiet resolve. The Bagger stared and stared at the picture and then finally looked at the caption. The guy in the jillion dollar suit next to Harvey was … his brother Bob. The Bagger does not know Bob well, but he has been in a few meetings with him. And Bob, surely a man who knows his way around his business and genre films in particular, is no threat to serve as the rack for the next fashion shoot in Esquire. Man, the Bagger knows Vanity Fair makes people look better than they are in real life and all, but the other brother looked amazing. The Bagger, who specializes in rumpled suits and untucked shirts, is a doughy white guy who covets the new Bob Weinstein look. He would do anything to look like that.

Clemons interprets President Bush’s March 25, 2003, executive order No. 13292 , which everyone assumes is the order to which Cheney is referring, to mean that the vice president can classify but not declassify information. “So, Cheney is engaged in Executive Branch over-reach again, implying he has a power that is not designated,” Clemons concludes.

2006-02-20,Up Front,"As the long war over Darwinism continues, it can seem as if science and religion are approaching a kind of final intellectual battle. But Leon Wieseltier will have none of it. ""Every true result of scientific research is compatible with the belief in God, if you believe in God,"" Wieseltier, the longtime literary editor of The New Republic, said in a telephone interview. ""Science gives an account of nature, but nature must not serve as the basis for our beliefs about the meanings and the obligations of human life. The wisdom of nature is not the only wisdom there is."" This week, Wieseltier reviews the philosopher Daniel C. Dennett's ""Breaking the Spell,"" which offers a strictly Darwinian (and unapologetically pugnacious) account of religion. A Brooklyn yeshiva graduate who went on to study literature, philosophy and religion at Columbia, Oxford and Harvard, Wieseltier is no stranger to the traffic between reason and faith. His 1998 book, ""Kaddish,"" was a meditation on the Jewish tradition of mourning, written in the wake of his father's death. But Wieseltier declines to define his own religious commitments even as he draws deeply on his religious learning. ""For philosophical reasons,"" he said, ""I live happily in the world of religion, but not always religiously."" His review begins on Page 11.

If any members of this audience make a connection between their own underclothes and the presence onstage of a child from the Arctic whaling grounds, they don't let on.

If there's any drawback at all to the look favored by Porteños (as residents of Buenos Aires are called), it's that it can be a little, well, monotonous. Another luxurious sweater-tweed combo? More butter-soft leather? Yes, you're hot, but so is everyone else, and in exactly the same way.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/travel/buenos-aires-mens-wear.html

2006-02-20,Nonfiction Chronicle,"THE FILM SNOB'S DICTIONARY: An Essential Lexicon of Filmological Knowledge. By David Kamp with Lawrence Levi. (Broadway, paper, $11.95.) Wire services may have trained one generation of journalists -- the foreign correspondent Ryszard Kapuscinski among them -- to write tersely. But a younger generation of journalists learned the art of brevity by toiling away in the trenches of magazine margins. Cases in point: Kamp, a contributor to Vanity Fair and GQ, and Levi, who is on the staff of the editorial page at The New York Times, both once worked at Spy and, over the years, have burnished the 28-word-and-under profile to a sheen. (Kamp was also a co-author of ""The Rock Snob's Dictionary."") In a guide to cinematic terms, actors and more, here's how they describe Robert Evans's life in the 1980's: ""a cocaine bust, a link to a murder case, a spotty record as an independent producer, an ever more frightening array of tinted eyeglasses."" On Peter Greenaway: ""Arguably the perviest of the Brit-perv director set that includes Nicolas Roeg, Ken Russell and Derek Jarman."" And the critic Stanley Kauffmann: ""An unblurbable iconoclast in a Peter Travers age, Kauffmann perseveres in a time-warped intellectualist cocoon, conveying carnal excitement only when his crush, Emma Thompson, appears in a film."" Aside from skewering various indie heroes, Kamp and Levi define genres frequently cited by film snobs, like ""chop-socky"" (""identified with the latter-day Hong Kong film industry that begat Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo""), ""grindhouse"" (as in, for example, ""I Dismember Mama"") and ""W.I.P.""

PETER WATKINS's 1976 masterpiece ""EDVARD MUNCH"" may not be the greatest of all biopics -- although a strong case can be made -- but it surely ranks with the most innovative and lucid. Here is a true life and times, both scholarly and poetic, in which the painter's everyday travails are fused with incisive cultural analysis. Mr. Watkins was way ahead of the curve in his blurring of documentary and fiction, scoring his material with an art-historical voice-over while a nonprofessional cast (headed by GEIR WESTBY in the title role) pantomime in period costumes on historically accurate sets. They have been instructed to stare into the camera in nearly every scene, obliterating the fourth wall in extended homage to Munch's ""Death in the Sickroom."" More Cubist than Abstract Expressionist, full of odd angles and dazzling patterns, ""Edvard Munch"" is a stylistic tour de force that reinvents portraiture as thoroughly as its subject did.

Brassart, the school's director, to schedule the test -- politely, at first, then with an increasing insistence -- my requests were met with stony silence. The truth is that Mme. Brassart and I got on each other's nerves. She seemed to think that awarding a student a diploma was like inducting them into some kind of secret society; as a result, the school's hallways were filled with an air of petty jealousy and distrust. From my perspective, Mme. Brassart lacked professional experience, was a terrible administrator and tangled herself up in picayune details and politics. Because of its exalted reputation, the Cordon Bleu's pupils came from all over the globe. But the lack of a qualified and competent head was hurting the school -- and could damage the reputation of French cooking, or even France herself, in the eyes of the world.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/eat-memory-sacre-cordon-bleu.html

Few artists were able to expose the defects and absurdities of a mechanized society like the Dadaists, the loose-knit group of artists whose work was a reaction to the grinding carnage of World War I. But what's surprising about the show is the creative range of the works, which were produced between 1916 and 1924: from HANNAH HÖCH's wonderfully bizarre photomontages to the more politically edgy work of JOHN HEARTFIELD. The show traces the wanderings of Dada's principal actors from Zurich to Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, Paris and New York, and in the process reveals a movement that is as fresh -- and relevant -- today as it was in a Europe edging toward World War II.

One benefit is that I get to go to the bathroom at work. When I came out of the bathroom the other day, I saw the back of a man walking out the front door. As we don't carry men's clothing, my eyes scanned the desk to see if he had left fliers or menus. Nothing. Then I realized ""nothing"" included my cellphone, which had been sitting on the counter. I grabbed the house phone and dialed my cell number. No ringing in the store. Two girls moseyed in. I grabbed the store keys and pronounced: ""You guys are going to have to leave. I've been robbed."" They blurted words of encouragement and cooperatively dashed out, watching me lock the front door.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/bad-call.html

ANGEL CORELLA and ETHAN STIEFEL are from American Ballet Theater, the Danish-born JOHAN KOBBORG dances with the Royal Ballet, and NIKOLAY TSISKARIDZE is from the Bolshoi Ballet. Not only will they dazzle audiences with a variety of virtuoso leaps and spins in excerpts from the classical repertory, they have also commissioned new solos for the occasion by a quartet of slightly unlikely choreographers: Roland Petit (for Mr. Tsiskaridze), Nils Christe (for Mr. Stiefel), Stanton Welch (for Mr. Corella) and Tim Rushton (for Mr. Kobborg). Of even more interest is the commission of a new work for the four men by Christopher Wheeldon, economically titled ""For 4"" and set to Schubert.

2006-02-20,Great Performers,"Around this time of year, acting in movies starts to feel like a kind of athletic event, with prizes awarded to the winners while the losers are reduced to being glamorous extras on televised award show after televised award show. By the time of the Academy Awards, which this year will take place on March 5, the spirit of the contest seems to take precedence over artistic achievement. This year, as in the previous two, The New York Times Magazine has tried to eschew this notion of competition by saluting the performances that moved, surprised and thrilled us, regardless of whether they were nominated for awards. Some -- like Reese Witherspoon's in ""Walk the Line"" -- have been acknowledged by Oscar, while others -- like Penélope Cruz's in the Italian film ""Don't Move"" -- were barely seen in America. And while it's very likely that you've caught Heath Ledger's heartbreaking turn in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" you may have easily missed the explosive German film ""Head-On,"" which starred Sibel Kekilli and Birol Ünel. In 2005, George Clooney may have had the most diverse year in film: he packed on weight to play a wary, melancholic C.I.A. agent in the largely overlooked ""Syriana"" and then masterminded and starred in ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" the story of Edward R. Murrow's clash with Senator Joseph McCarthy. Performances as enthralling and complex as those by (the nominated) Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" or (the unnominated) Jeff Daniels in ""The Squid and the Whale"" should not be overshadowed by the suspense of who will and who won't receive a statuette. Once again, the photography team of Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin has beautifully composed and captured the variety of characters who resonated with us this year and distilled the essence of what makes great movie acting great.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/great-performers.html

2006-02-20,'Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt'," As the delay lengthened and nervousness grew, self appointed society experts in the crowd had time to debate one important question: had anyone seen the Vanderbilt family, whose apotheosis this was alleged to be? There could be no dispute that Vanderbilt gold was a powerful chemical element at work in St Thomas Church on 6 November 1895. It had given the bride her singular aura; it had drawn a duke from England; and without it, Alva would not now be waiting anxiously for her daughter to arrive. Scintillae of Vanderbilt gold dust brushed everything on the morning of Consuelo's wedding, from the fronds of asparagus fern to the glinting lorgnettes in the crowd outside. It was remarkable, therefore, that apart from the father-of-the bride, its chief purveyors should be so conspicuously absent; and even more striking that this scarcely mattered because of the force of character of the bride's Vanderbilt great-grandfather, whose ancestral shade still hovered over the players in the morning's drama as if he were alive.

2006-02-20,'A Plea for Eros'," My father once asked me if I knew where yonder was. I said I thought yonder was another word for there. He smiled and said, ""No, yonder is between here and there."" This little story has stayed with me for years as an example of linguistic magic: It identified a new space-a middle region that was neither here nor there-a place that simply didn't exist for me until it was given a name. During my father's brief explanation of the meaning of yonder, and every time I've thought of it since, a landscape appears in my mind: I am standing at the crest of a small hill looking down into an open valley where there is a single tree, and beyond it lies the horizon defined by a series of low mountains or hills. This dull but serviceable image returns when I think of yonder, one of those wonderful words I later discovered linguists call ""shifters""-words distinct from others because they are animated by the speaker and move accordingly. In linguistic terms this means that you can never really find yourself yonder. Once you arrive at yonder tree, it becomes here and recedes forever into that imaginary horizon. Words that wobble attract me. The fact that here and there slide and slip depending on where I am is somehow poignant, revealing both the tenuous relation between words and things and the miraculous flexibility of language.

2006-02-20,After Neoconservatism,"As we approach the third anniversary of the onset of the Iraq war, it seems very unlikely that history will judge either the intervention itself or the ideas animating it kindly. By invading Iraq, the Bush administration created a self-fulfilling prophecy: Iraq has now replaced Afghanistan as a magnet, a training ground and an operational base for jihadist terrorists, with plenty of American targets to shoot at. The United States still has a chance of creating a Shiite-dominated democratic Iraq, but the new government will be very weak for years to come; the resulting power vacuum will invite outside influence from all of Iraq's neighbors, including Iran.

About 600,000 state residents have been enrolled in the program, and it is estimated that half live in New York City. Mr. Stringer said 311 should help older residents appeal denials of drug requests and inform them about subsidies to pay out-of-pocket costs. Several social service groups, including the Community Service Society of New York and the Medicare Rights Center, support the proposal. Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor, said 311 callers are referred to a federal hot line, 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), and to 40 walk-in centers run by the city's Department for the Aging. Since November, those centers have counseled 16,500 residents on the new benefit and given presentations to 7,000 others.

When competing with ABC's Sunday powerhouses, the games once again fell short, and the two networks split a ratings victory for the night: NBC managed to draw the most viewers over all, but ABC easily took the all-important 18-to-49 demographic. According to Nielsen's estimates, the Olympics broadcast was No. 1 from 7 to 9 p.m. among both total viewers and adults 18 to 49, but then ""Desperate Housewives"" began on ABC, and the night became a downhill slope for NBC. ""Housewives"" not only dominated the hour in the 18-to-49 group but also brought in 23.34 million viewers over all, as opposed to NBC's 21.84 million. And when ""Grey's Anatomy"" took over on ABC at 10, that hospital soap opera became the night's most-watched program, with 24.35 million viewers (versus 18.58 million for the Olympics).

2006-02-21,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BARRETTO, RAY","BARRETTO--Ray. It is with deep regret and sadness that the family of the legendary Ray Barretto announces that the acclaimed Conga Maestro died Friday, February 17, 2006. Mr. Barretto died at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ at 5 AM EST. His family was at his bedside. A leading force in both the Salsa and Latin Jazz worlds, Ray was one of the most prolific, influential and recorded Latin percussionists in the history of jazz and a pioneer in the world of salsa. His salsa aficionados and fans are represented throughout the world. The man popularly known as ""Hard Hands"" (Manos Duras) was raised in East Harlem and the Bronx, but was enthralled by the big band sounds of Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. During his military tour through Europe, the musical influence of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie claimed his attention at a GI jazz club. His world and his eventual global impact were never quite the same again. Just this past January, he received a most prestigious award from the National Endowment for the Arts for his legendary contributions to jazz. This is the highest honor that our nation bestows upon jazz musicians in recognition that this magnificent art form, so profoundly based in American culture, is one of America's greatest gifts to the world. Mr. Barretto is survived by his wife, Annette, their son, Chris (age 20), and Raun, Ray and Kelly from a former marriage. A public viewing will be held Wednesday, February 22nd, from 11 AM to 5 PM, 6 PM to 10 PM, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/classified/paid-notice-deaths-barretto-ray.html

2006-02-21,Those Who Trespass,"The press release says the Spiritual Cinema Circle, an online DVD club, has discovered “a spiritual side of Hollywood.” The Bagger is willing to acknowledge a power greater than himself, but when it comes to Hollywood’s taste in deities, he is pretty sure that the last three digits of the zip code should be 666, not 210.

2006-02-21,Achievement Squared,"Last summer, the Bagger had a chance to sit on a golf cart with Robert Altman talking about film. The Bagger had the common sense to do a lot of listening, but it was a gas to watch Mr. Altman shoot “A Prairie Home Companion,” with director Paul Thomas Anderson, of all people, hanging in the wings. Terrence Rafferty performs a whopper of a retrospective in a little local daily that shows that Mr. Altman has not lost the vinegar that made him such a tangy delight for decades of filmgoers. Now the Academy, which has always managed to step past Mr. Altman’s work briskly, is pausing to acknowledge a lifetime of work. With his son manning the camera at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to film Garrison Keillor’s script, Mr. Altman did not mess around. As soon as a shot was set up, he would yell, “Let’s boogie!” and the camera would roll. Mr. Altman, who is hardly hypnotized by the commercial prospects of his films, told the Bagger he thought “Prairie Home” might find an audience. ”Garrison’s audience is like the Mel Gibson Jesus audience,” he said. “This movie is going to play for two weeks in places like Chicken Switch, Arizona, because the program has such strong rural appeal.” The Bagger has spent a lot of time, metaphorically speaking, in Chicken Switch, and there isn’t a lot of competition there for the disposable entertainment dollar. But then there probably isn’t a movie theater either.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/achievement-squared/

2006-02-21,Juicy Bits,"How will Jon Stewart feather in his performance at the Oscars? Like Steve Martin, only better, if all goes well. He will stay inside the lines, but don’t look for him to give “Brokeback” a total pass. “To not talk about ‘Brokeback Mountain’ at the Oscars would be like going to the White House correspondents’ dinner and not talking about the president,” Ben Karlin tells Jacques Steinberg. And the veep who couldn’t shoot straight will get a turn: “We’re doing it. Same goes for ‘Herbie: Fully Loaded.’ “",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/juicy-bits/
2006-02-21,Mid-Atlantic Awards,"The British Academy of Film and Television Arts swooned and swooned hard for “Brokeback,” loading up its bulging saddlebags with the picture, director and screenplay awards, plus an acting kudo. Jake Gyllenhaal, who through a fluke of marketing and contest machinations has been something of a forgotten man this awards season – the Bagger thinks he should get some kind of recognition for his Santa hat dance in “Jarhead” – acted genuinely surprised when the supporting actor award came his way. The best supporting award on the distaff side went to Thandie Newtown for her role in “Crash” – she may have been born in Zambia, but the British claim her as their own. Reese Witherspoon won best actress in a walk, but then, Felicity Huffman was not even up in that category. It will be fascinating to see whether Ms. Witherspoon’s demure approach to Oscar campaigning – she isn’t doing it – will trump Ms. Huffman’s willingness to show up just about anywhere there is a podium. The Bagger is not suggesting that there is something craven in Ms. Huffman’s approach; it looks less like she wants it than that she is going to enjoy every single minute of her day in the sun. And the Academy could do worse than having a 43-year-old actress at the microphone who counted a good audition as one in which her bicycle was not stolen while she was taking her turn. Awards for screenplay, adapted and original, went to “Brokeback” and “Crash” respectively and it would be hard to envision BAFTA’s American analogs doing it any differently.

2006-02-21,Alert the Others,"The Bagger was at a party over the weekend of plain old civilians and noticed that they were talking about the Oscars, of all things. Up until now, the Bagger has felt as if he belonged to a small, fetish-driven cult. Sure, those of you in the racket or who live with a virtual attachment to all things Oscar think he’s nuts, but guys, out here in the world, a lot of people care as much about the Oscars as the trade deficit. But that’s changing. The Bagger listened to an animated discussion between “Brokeback Mountain” vs. “Crash” loyalists, and managed, with a tremendous amount of personal effort, to keep his piehole shut: Nothing can bring a nice party chat to a screeching halt more quickly than some dweeby know-it-all who has been sitting in his basement checking Oscar-related bookmarks for two months now. But now that the Academy Awards are just around the corner, normal people who have no idea who won best cinematographer in 1976 are starting to take an interest.

Its highest-rated time period was at 10 p.m., which featured men's aerial skiing and, more notably, ice dancing and the soap opera antics of the feuding Italian pair Barbara Fusar Poli and Maurizio Margaglio, above, who appeared to broker their reconciliation during their time on the ice. That hour delivered 23.83 million viewers. Elsewhere on the networks, a Monday episode of ""House"" (14.06 million) and a regularly scheduled ""24"" (13.7 million) put Fox in second place for the night.

Services Thursday 11:45 AM at ""The Riverside"", 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. $(6$)FURMAN -- Seymour, M.D. Died February 20, 2006 after a prolonged illness. He is widely known as the pacemaker pioneer who, on July 16, 1958, first showed that pacemakers could stimulate the heart through plastic - covered wires inserted through veins into the heart, avoiding the need for opening the chest to sew electrodes onto the surface of the heart. His associates were Doris J.W. Escher, M.D., and the late John B. Schwedel, M.D. He invented telephone monitoring of pacemaker function in cooperation with bioengineer Bryan Parker. He was the Founder of the Heart Rythm Society (HRS), a professional organization, and long-time editor of its journal, PACE. Dr. Furman rose to international fame, with over 1000 publications, leadership of many national and international conferences, and presidency of (HRS). Many details are available at the HRS website, www.hrsonline.org. Seymour Furman was born in the Bronx in 1931, he graduated from NYU, and SUNY Downstate College of Medicine. He trained in surgery at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, then served in the U.S. Navy Medical Corps. After training as a heart surgeon, he returned to Montefiore, with progressive emphasis on pacemakers, so that much of his career was spent with the cardiology division. He remained at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where he became professor of both medicine and surgery. Dr. Furman was predeceased in 2002 by his wife, the former Evelyn Katz.

""Taxpayers can't get a refund if they don't file a return.""

Mr. McCreevy, left, the commissioner for the internal market, said moves by France and Luxembourg to shield the steel group Arcelor from a takeover by Mittal Steel were out of step with European law. At the same time, he threatened Poland with a lawsuit over its attempts to protect a domestic banking group. Poland has held firm in its decision to block the acquisition of Bank BPH by UniCredito, the last obstacle to Unicredito's $25 billion purchase of the HVB Group of Germany, which owns BPH. Protectionism is ""the wrong message to be sending about the openness of the European Union to new investment,"" he said in a news briefing in Brussels. Mr. McCreevy's broadside came the same day that Thierry Breton, the finance minister of France, proposed legislation limiting unsolicited takeovers. The law would allow possible takeover targets the right to give shareholders the right to buy new stock at a discount to ward off hostile bids.

The actor nominated in a film that was the lowest-grossing of the group has never won the ultimate prize. And a number of metrics, all taken together, point to Keira Knightley, not Reese Witherspoon, as best actress. Matt Dillon gets the edge over St. George in the supporting category, but favorite Rachel Weisz comes out on top in the computations. What does it all mean?

Though the rest of her music may not break much new ground, Ms. Tunstall's debut album, ""Eye to the Telescope,"" is happily occupied with grown-up concerns. Having paid her dues in bands in the United States, Ms. Tunstall has just won a Brit Award for best British female solo artist. There is lots of promise to her album, with some songs suggesting a bouncier Fiona Apple and others, less interestingly, conjuring a pricklier Dido or Nellie Furtado. Ms. Tunstall is touring here now amid buzz generated by the rainbow suspenders she sports over a sparkling shirt on her album's cover shot, interpreted by some fans as a lesbian symbol. Ms. Tunstall has said that she didn't know of the connection, but for a rising star, at this point, you assume any chatter is welcome chatter.

2006-02-24,'Casino',"""Goodfellas"" in Vegas: that's how a lot of people greeted Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" when it came out in 1995. After all, both movies took their screenplays from Nicholas Pileggi books that burrow deep into the muck and minutiae of organized crime. In both, Joe Pesci plays an unhinged thug. Equal in scope and ambition, these epic cautionary tales are about vice, capitalism and the American Way. Unmistakably, they are also about the virtuosity of their maker. ""Casino"" supercharges the ""Goodfellas"" paradigm: wall-to-wall pop music, crackerjack montage, a quicksilver camera that glides through the scenery with curving, craning, whiplash sinuosity. Yes, ""Mr. Scorsese has been here and done this already,"" as Janet Maslin wrote in her review of ""Casino"" in The New York Times, ""but not with his new film's blistering bitterness or its peacock extravagance."" And not with Sharon Stone (above, with Robert De Niro) in the performance of a lifetime as Ginger McKenna, an ambitious, unstable Strip hustler who catches the eye of the casino boss Sam Rothstein (Mr. De Niro, in a splendidly restrained performance that makes amends for his histrionics in ""Cape Fear""). Mr. Scorsese is no more repetitive than Balzac and just as talented a historian. We should be so lucky as to see ""Goodfellas"" in Kansas, California or Washington.

Rangel said yesterday that he would announce his endorsement of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for governor this morning, a month after the two Democrats sparred over Mr. Spitzer's choice of a running mate. Mr. Spitzer had chosen David A. Paterson, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, for lieutenant governor instead of Mr. Rangel's preferred candidate, Leecia Eve. (Ms. Eve subsequently dropped out.) Mr. Rangel, the dean of the New York Congressional delegation, will also endorse Mr. Paterson today. Asked what was most compelling about Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Rangel said, ""That he doesn't stand a chance of losing."" The Spitzer camp is rolling out endorsements by Mr. Rangel and others in advance of tomorrow's expected announcement by Thomas R.

2006-02-24,The Listings: Feb. 24 - March 2; EWA PODLES with the MOSCOW CHAMBER ORCHESTRA,"""Why isn't she at the Met?"" wail many opera fans who will buy tickets to Sunday's concert for the Polish contralto Ewa Podles (pronounced AY-va POHD-lezh) alone. One of the few true contraltos singing today, with a dusky voice and profoundly expressive artistry, Ms. Podles is the opposite of the stereotype of a pretty singer; this is not a voice to play in the background at brunch, but one that has the power to move you to the tips of your toes as it rises from inky depths through a husky center to ringing top notes. And where many singers are limited to a few kinds of music, Ms. Podles has a huge range of repertory, some of which she will demonstrate in this concert, which takes her from a Rossini cantata, ""Joan of Arc"" (orchestrated by the contemporary Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino), to one of her showpieces, Mussorgsky's ""Songs and Dances of Death"" (orchestrated by Shostakovich). The concert is not actually a recital, but the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, which under its music director, Constantine Orbelian, will also play orchestral arrangements of Prokofiev's ""Visions Fugitives,"" Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor and Haydn's Symphony No. 49. Well and good, but since the event represents Ms. Podles's only New York appearance this season, it's likely to attract a disproportionate number of opera lovers. Peter Gelb, are you listening?

2006-02-24,The Listings: Feb. 24 - March 2; HUMAN FEEL,"During the first half of the 1990's, the ensemble known as Human Feel, above, was several things at once: a workshop for unruly improvisational tactics, a self-styled alternative to neo-conservatism, and a delivery system for some of the era's most unclassifiable new talent. Its founding core consisted of the multireedists Chris Speed and Andrew D'Angelo and the drummer Jim Black, a trio of Seattle natives transplanted via music school to Boston, where they shared an apartment as well as an aesthetic. Various others floated in and out of the group before the arrival of the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, which proved definitive. As a bass-less quartet, Human Feel strained toward the ragged-edge postmodernism established by a previous generation of downtown avatars like John Zorn and Tim Berne, but with an emotional directness more closely derived from underground rock. It was energy music, plugged into the spirit of the age. Arriving in New York, the band's members were quickly absorbed into one scene or another: Mr. Speed and Mr. Black became one half of Mr. Berne's raucous Bloodcount, Mr. D'Angelo dug in with the drummer Matt Wilson, and Mr. Rosenwinkel became a mainstay at Smalls. The musicians have hardly been strangers since, but the last proper Human Feel album, ""Speak to It"" (Songlines), was released in 1996. This reunion -- the first in years -- comes amid reports of a new recording. And it offers a good measure of the ways in which the musicians, separately and in collaboration, have exceeded their early promise.

2006-02-27,"Arts, Briefly; NBC's Olympics Outruns The Competition","The reach of network television erodes nearly every year, so Thursday's full menu of popular choices spread among the big four broadcasters was a rarity. NBC's Olympics telecast, which featured the women's figure skating finals, carried the night, with an average of 24.49 million viewers in prime time, according to Nielsen's estimates. It was in the 8 p.m. hour when the four networks really collided. The results show of Fox's ""American Idol,"" during which 4 contestants of the top 24 got the boot, was the clear winner, with an audience of 23.07 million. Competing against it were CBS's ""Survivor"" (14.85 million) and the first hour of ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" (14.78 million), as well as the Olympics (17.74 million). The three non-Olympic programs cannibalized one another, as ""Idol"" didn't perform at its usual heights, and ""Survivor"" had its lowest-rated original episode ever. (""Dancing"" did rebound in its second hour, lifting its total audience to 17.68 million.) Between 10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., skating took over, with an audience of more than 30 million tuning in to NBC. Over all on Thursday, Fox ranked second in the 18-to-49 demographic, followed by CBS and ABC. Among total viewers for this interesting night, ABC was No. 2, followed by Fox and CBS.

2006-02-27,The High Cost of Breaking Even,"""Bug,"" the blood-drenched thriller by Tracy Letts, had all the hallmarks of a runaway success: fawning reviews, a young, hip cast and a movie deal. Despite running for 11 months at the Barrow Street Theater, though, the $200,000 production barely broke even, only collecting its first dollars in the black -- and there weren't many of them -- in its closing weeks in January 2005. It's a phenomenon that is all too familiar to commercial producers Off Broadway, which has been in a protracted slump in the last couple of years. ""It's a constant struggle to justify the business,"" said Scott Morfee, one of the ""Bug"" producers. But what exactly makes the business so tough? Well, expenses, which keep growing, and audiences, which don't. ""Bug"" cost about $34,000 a week to run; some Off Broadway productions cost twice that. Mr. Morfee and his partners kept expenses down a number of ways, including managing the show themselves and staging it at the Barrow, where Mr. Morfee holds the lease. To show how hard it can be to make a go of it, Mr. Morfee took the rare step of opening his books on ""Bug""; the figures at right are averages taken from several different weeks during the run. They include some one-time costs -- like the opening-night cast party -- amortized over the show's 11-month run. And while this is an average week, ""Bug"" broke even with the help of some sell-out weeks, when the profits were greater than those shown here. In the end, ""Bug"" sold about $2 million worth of tickets and cost about $2 million to run. All of which leaves Mr. Morfee a little bemused. ""If we pop the Champagne every time we break even,"" he said, ""I don't know what kind of business we're in.""",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/theater/newsandfeatures/the-high-cost-of-breaking-even.html

2006-02-27,Up Front,"Second terms are often unkind to American presidents. After winning re-election in a landslide in 1936, the seemingly invincible Franklin Roosevelt stumbled badly with his plan to pack the Supreme Court. Richard Nixon had Watergate, Ronald Reagan Iran-contra. Bill Clinton coasted to victory in 1996, then saw the name Monica enter the history books. Is George W. Bush, not yet halfway through his second term, heading down the same road? Two reviews in this issue suggest that the president is facing problems not only with Democrats but with members of his own camp. In his review of ""My Year in Iraq,"" the memoir by L. Paul Bremer III (Page 8), Dexter Filkins recounts ""a jaw-dropping scene"" in which Bremer, who ran Iraq for 14 months, indicates that he knew what reporters like Filkins were seeing around them -- the White House had failed to provide sufficient troops to do the job they were sent to Iraq to do. On the domestic front, meanwhile, deep divisions have emerged among Republicans whom the administration had successfully kept united until now. Discussing Jeffrey Hart's ""Making of the Conservative Mind"" and Bruce Bartlett's ""Impostor"" (Page 9), George Will describes ""conservatives at daggers drawn with one another,"" as tensions rise between religious populists and Goldwater libertarians. Indeed, as Will suggests, with Republicans of every stripe criticizing the president for one thing or another, the very meaning of the word ""conservative"" may now be up for grabs.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/books/arts/up-front.html

The items in question were a characteristically whimsical Marni evening pouch that had cost this side of $800 -- and that I had originally planned to wear to a nephew's bar mitzvah to offset a stark, synagogue-appropriate St. John Knits ensemble but in the end decided against in favor of a borrowed and less contrapuntal Lambertson Truex lizard clutch -- and an uncharacteristically unconstructed Jil Sander bag ($670) that had briefly spoken to me in my continuing search for an Edenic black bag.

When you consider the inherent romance and adventure of hunting for buried treasure, it seems odd that America's gold rushes haven't yielded a more enduring literature: people left everything behind and suffered grueling hardship for the chance to find a fortune, and all we got out of it were Jack London's anthropomorphic dogs and ""Oh My Darling Clementine""? Into the void steps ""The Fugitive Wife,"" an enormously satisfying first novel about the dreamers and schemers who flocked to Alaska at the turn of the 20th century. The heroine, Essie Crummey, is a spunky Minnesota farm girl who has finally given up on her alcoholic husband after the death of their child. Fleeing home, Essie encounters a crew of Nome-bound prospectors, and when their foreman offers her a job tending the stables, she impulsively accepts.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

Here is a look at the long program jumps of previous winners and this year's medalists. One caveat when comparing skaters from different eras: the maximum number of jumping passes has changed over the years. Baiul and Yamaguchi had eight jumping passes, while Lipinski and Hughes had six. Current rules allow seven jumping passes.

He was 68 years old, born in Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of Irene Polansky Lichtenstein and A. Albert Lichtenstein. He began working at EMA in June, 1972. Lichtenstein became President of EMA in December, 1995 and retired as a Senior Associate in December, 2001. In 1958, upon graduation from City College of New York School of Engineering, he became a petrochemical engineer for Standard Oil of New Jersy.

2006-02-27,The Remix: Q.& A.; Zandra With a Z,"The buzz at the collections was ""very Zandra Rhodes."" If you had to define your style, what would you say? My garments are totally based around what the print can do -- the print creating all the shape. I think of myself as a print designer who became a fashion designer. Do you take the view, like Chanel and Lagerfeld, that it is a compliment to be copied? Copying is always going to happen, so it is better to be copied and noted as mine. Are the patterns drawn from life or the imagination? The pattern is drawn from whatever I am inspired by, be it travel to China or knitting stitches on a sweater in Wales. The source of all my inspiration is my sketchbook. I travel everywhere with it. The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is doing a show about British style in May. Do you feel you were part of a movement in the 60's? My 60's contribution comes from my English roots, but reinterpreting Warhol and Lichtenstein: light bulbs, comics, lipstick advertisements by Guy Bourdin in Vogue. I think most remarkable are the chic hippie looks of the late 60's and early 70's and the flowing caftans. Tell me about your museum in London. I founded the Fashion and Textile Museum because I believe British fashion and the U.K. art-school system have had a groundbreaking effect on world fashion. I felt people like Ossie Clark, Jean Muir and Bill Gibb have never had the recognition they deserve. I have found the museum an uphill task. Most of the money I have managed to raise has come from the American Friends of the Zandra Rhodes Museum. Do you feel helped by the Pucci revival and the change of mood or, for you, is it prints now and forever? I feel very positive by the way fashion has chosen to revamp old brands.

2006-02-27,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BAREISS, MOLLY (MARY) STIMSON","BAREISS -- Molly (Mary) Stimson. Molly (Mary) Stimson Bareiss (1920-2006) was the soul that held our family together. She was a true, no nonsense Yankee with a generous heart, a gentle spirit and a fierce loyalty. She guarded the inner circle, was an excellent judge of character, and those she let in were friends for life. The elegance of her straight posture denied her failed joints from a rheumatic youth. It didn't keep her from an active sport's life and rough-housing with children. A pioneer graduate of Bennington College, a Kindergarten teacher, a painter and a philanthropist, Molly was a forceful balance to a very dynamic husband. At the age of forty, she followed Walter to Germany. Although not speaking a word of German, she eventually became fluent and established a home for her family and a large circle of friends. Her insight was invaluable in moments of family crisis. She understood what was happening and had love for all. The loss of her wisdom and sense of fun leaves a void in our hearts. Molly died at home surrounded by her family on February 20th. The last two years were not kind to her. It was her time to go.. She had a clear and constant courage; we see the best of her in our families and in the hope for our future. We will miss her. She is survived by her husband Walter, her five children, 11 grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. In addition to living overseas Molly has been a resident of Greenwich, CT since the late '40s. For those who knew Molly the family requests a contributions to a memory book.

Schwartz, a grocer's son from the Bronx who had acquired a serviceable education hanging around pool halls and racetracks, gave his boyhood friend Calvin Klein $10,000 to start a coat business. Since then, hundreds of designers, when faced with the terrible odds of going solo in the fashion business, have said to themselves, ""What I need is a Barry Schwartz."" A Schwartz at your back was proof against shutdown, a guarantee of unending loyalty. Three years ago, Klein and Schwartz sold Calvin Klein Inc. to Phillips-Van Heusen in a deal worth about $730 million. Klein has kept a hand in the company's advertising. He also travels a lot; Brazil is apparently a favorite destination. Schwartz, a gambler at bottom, devotes himself to his horse-racing operations, a sideline developed in the first gold-rush days of designer denim and underwear. Horses bred on his 741-acre farm in Westchester County run at the country's top tracks, and Schwartz stepped down as the chairman of the New York Racing Association at the end of 2004. Although Wall Street was skeptical that Phillips-Van Heusen could manage a designer label -- it was better known for brands like Izod and Bass -- Calvin Klein has apparently thrived under PVH. Its runway collections, by Klein's chosen successor, Francisco Costa, have received some of the best reviews in the company's history, and PVH's stock price has risen from $11.50 in January 2003 to nearly $37 as of mid-January.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/style/tmagazine/what-comes-between-costa-and-his-calvins.html

2006-02-27,"Far From the Spotlight, the True Powers of Broadway","EVEN if you're an avid theatergoer, you probably don't know any of the 20 people pictured above among the orchestra seats of the August Wilson Theater. But in a business often associated with name-brand stars, diva-wrangling directors and picky playwrights, these are the people who help bring those characters' talents to a paying audience. They range from Tara Rubin, an unsuccessful actress turned very successful casting director (she has accounts with six musicals now running on Broadway) to Freddie Gershon, a smooth-talking show salesman whose work on the road keeps royalties rolling in for cash-poor creative types back in town. While much of the power on Broadway remains in the hands of the producers, the theater owners and the critics -- and much of the business's day-to-day is handled by camera-shy tribes of press agents and general managers -- many of this assembled cast are valuable specialists in an increasingly complex industry. Armed with talents like negotiation (see The Lawyers, The Labor Leaders), sales (The Licensers, The Group Seller), buzz (The Marketers) or taste (The Agents, The Casting Agents), each has a niche, if not a big name. Here is a selective look at some of the behind-the-scenes players on Broadway, what they do, and why. Even if you don't know their faces, the spring theater season would be hard to pull off without them.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/theater/newsandfeatures/far-from-the-spotlight-the-true-powers-of-broadway.html

2006-02-27,Inside the List,"FRENCH TOAST: If you're a writer with a new book in stores, is it better to get a memorably negative review in The Times Book Review . . . or is it better to get no review at all? That's a question we're sometimes asked, and it's a question we tend to leave to the book industry's gods, philosophers and publicists. But most writers will tell you they'll take the bad review -- better to take a pounding than be ignored entirely. Bernard-Henri Lévy, the French writer whose book ""American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville"" was eaten alive on our cover recently by Garrison Keillor (""Don't let the door hit you on the way out"" was one of the kinder lines), agrees with that sentiment. ""My belief is that controversy is always good,"" Lévy said good-naturedly in a recent telephone interview. ""I've always thought controversy is the best thing that can happen -- well, one of the best things."" Keillor's review doesn't seem to have hurt sales of ""American Vertigo."" The book appeared on the hardcover nonfiction list last week at No. 15, though this week it drops to No. 28. On his book tour in the United States, Lévy said, he is always asked about Keillor's review. ""Everybody talks to me about it,"" he said, adding that the review has brought him waves of support and sympathy. While ""American Vertigo"" is Lévy's first best seller in the United States, he has published some 30 books in France, and nearly all the major ones have made the best-seller lists there. Lévy said he was ""surprised and pleased"" to see his book on the Times list. ""I've felt so at home in America,"" he added. ""Now I feel even more at home."" Back in France, Lévy sometimes reviews books. ""But like Garrison Keillor,"" he said, ""I am not a professional reviewer."" Has he panned many writers?

2006-02-27,The Remix; Viva BibaIn,"1971, the British boutique Biba was so successful that an anarchist group called the Angry Brigade bombed it as a symbol of the establishment. Four years later, however, this lavish emporium of cool, where flamingos once strolled and hippie chicks preened whenever Mick and Bianca breezed in, was on the auction block. One of its founders, Barbara Hulanicki, up and left London, and a label (below) that once defined a generation died a rock-star death. Fast-forward 30 years. After a few failed resuscitation attempts, Biba is back. Last fall Michael Pearce, who acquired the rights to Biba International Ltd., previewed a range of bags and shoes, which use the original lasts. This month, just as they hit stores like Browns, a Biba ready-to-wear line made its debut during London Fashion Week. The collection, which is designed by Bella Freud, mixes contemporary looks with tweaked Biba classics. Elsewhere, two books and a CD retrace the label's glory days, while a Biba museum exhibition and Biba Ball are in the works for later this year. Hulanicki is also working on what she says is ""the final book on Biba."" But her involvement ends there. She has distanced herself from the label since the 70's and is unimpressed by fashion's fixation with the past: ""Every house is chasing its own tail. Aren't there enough hip brands already?""

The fact that Frenchwomen don't get fat (to borrow the title of Mireille Guiliano's best-selling book) did not escape our notice, but it never occurred to us that their example might be exported, much less packaged and sold as a whole new wave of diet advice.

Little Edie, as she was known, has been a fashion antiheroine since she wrapped a skirt upside-down around her hips and called it ""the best costume for the day"" in Albert and David Maysles's 1975 cult documentary, ""Grey Gardens."" ""I can't count the number of times I've been at a fashion shoot where someone says, 'Let's tie a sweater on her head and do an Edie Beale,""' says Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. This spring, Beale, who died at age 84 in 2002, inspires a new generation through three projects: an off-Broadway musical based on Edie, her mother and their condemned mansion in East Hampton, N.Y.; a DVD with unseen ""Grey Gardens"" footage; and a scrapbook of Little Edie's photos and letters compiled by the New Yorker writer Hilton Als. Already there is buzz. ""What is so intriguing about Little Edie is her belief in her own beauty,"" says John Bartlett, whose fall 2000 collection used ""Grey Gardens"" as a leitmotif. ""To the outside world she must have seemed a freak, but to fashionistas she's an idol of self-expression.""

It's a symbol of her Cambridge days as a co-founder of Talking Tongues, an ambitious theater troupe that incorporated a ladder into one of its productions, and also of the spirit behind that endeavor. The tattoo is a reminder to have guts, take chances and throw yourself into what's scary and hard. ""It's very difficult to get great roles,"" Weisz said in early January, over a late-afternoon tea of yogurt and orange juice (she was five months pregnant) at a coffee shop near her Manhattan home in SoHo. Weisz can look smoky and irresistibly alluring on film, which seems to bring out the dark lushness of her hair and eyes, but in person she has a lovely, fresh-scrubbed quality. On the day we met, this was accentuated by a white wool sailor cap and an oversize blue-and-white-striped nautical sweater. Although she had just returned from a Christmas holiday in sunny Jamaica with her fiancé, the director Darren Aronofsky (""I'm in charge of the wedding,"" she explained about the reverse order of baby first and ceremony later, ""and I haven't figured all that out yet""), Weisz was alabaster pale and looked less like a siren and more like a radiant English schoolgirl, home from university.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/style/tmagazine/the-rachel-papers.html
2006-02-27,White Star,"Coco Chanel's jeweled cuffs, Diana Vreeland's red lips, Katharine Hepburn's mannish trousers: chic women always have a signature. For the designer Carolina Herrera, it's a white shirt. Make that dozens of white shirts. ""I think I was born in a white shirt,"" she says, laughing. ""And I'm constantly finding new ones, because you know, you can't keep them for very long. Once they lose their crispness, they must be retired."" Herrera has a couple other rules when it comes to button-downs, whether they hail from Banana Republic or her own design studio (like the one above): ""Collar height is crucial. I like it a little bit higher, so you don't have to turn it up. And the shirt must be cotton, so it stays crisp. Silk doesn't work."" Herrera's look travels well, too. ""Whether I'm going to South America in the summer or Europe in the winter, I always pack at least six white shirts,"" she says. ""I'll take different cuts, some with French cuffs, some with regular cuffs."" Much of the white shirt's appeal lies in its blank-slate versatility. Herrera is as likely to wear one to a formal occasion as she is to the beach. ""White shirts can be demure, elegant, mysterious or romantic,"" she says. ""I love the idea of wearing one with a ball gown. Or over a bustier with the buttons open -- very 18th century."" Or, better yet, by itself. ""After all, there's nothing sexier than a woman in her husband's white pajama top."" Sandra Ballentine TIMELESS",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/style/tmagazine/white-star.html

Bloomberg. The agreement will be announced today, according to Make the Road by Walking, an immigrant advocacy group that took part in the negotiations. The new services are an attempt to address a dispute over the Education Equity Act passed by the Council, which required the department to provide interpretation services at large meetings at which at least 10 percent of those likely to attend would be unable to speak English. Another requirement was that documents intended for parents, like report cards and important notices, had to be available in the nine languages most widely used in the city. The Council passed the act in December, on a 35-to-11 vote, but the mayor vetoed the measure in January, saying that, though he agreed with the substance of the proposal, only the state government could legislate on education matters. The agreement will have many of the same features as the Education Equity Act. JENNIFER 8.

2006-02-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SCHERZER, IRWIN S.","SCHERZER--Irwin S. Passed away at the age of 73 on February 24, 2006. Beloved son of the late Hyman and Bertha Scherzer. Irwin grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts and was an honors graduate of Harvard College Class of 1954 and Harvard Business School Class of 1956. He served for two years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy. He began his business career with west coast based RamoWooldridge Corp., but soon moved to New York and shifted his focus to the management of musical organizations. He got his start managing classical music bookings for Columbia Artists. Thereafter, he held several positions including Vice President of Grey Advertising with responsibility for the RCA classical musical label. In 1969, he became the founding administrative director of the newly formed Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. His management skills contributed mightily to the success of the fledgling effort, now one of the city's musical institutions. He worked closely with the directors of the Society including philanthropist Alice Tully. He subsequently became business manager and trusted adviser to Miss Tully who relied upon his many talents as she pursued her diverse activities in the arts and music. Irwin can only be described with superlatives. He was truly an example of the sui generis personality. Luminous intelligence, brilliant wit and raconteur, striking linguistic ability, generosity of spirit, a keen social conscience and indomitable courage in the face of adversity, these were the qualities that endeared him to his legion of friends. His knowledge of opera, classical music and the culinary arts was encyclopedic. His wit gushed forth in a seemingly unending flow of quips and jaunty apercus. He spoke six languages fluently and had a working knowledge of a half dozen more. He was never satisfied unless his friends shared fully in the realms that gave him pleasure, and thus did he enrich all who knew him. His social consciousness was manifested in his support of the battle against an outmoded social value. His zest for life never flagged despite daunting health issues. He lived a life filled with love and caring. Irwin is survived by his beloved partner, Chien Cho (JJ) Liu, and his devoted cousins Alicia, Babs, Harry, Gloria and Bobby. He will be sorely missed by his many friends who will forever cherish his memory and will find comfort in the warm remembrances of the good times spent with him. His memory can be honored by donations to Tannery Pond Concerts, P.O. Box 446, New Lebanon, NY 12125. A date for a memorial concert will be announced.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/28/classified/paid-notice-deaths-scherzer-irwin-s.html

The $420 million budget for the renovation project, starting in 2011 and expected to continue for about 15 years, was cleared unanimously after a yearlong struggle in the German legislature, representatives of the museum said yesterday. A fourth wing will permit the art of major civilizations from Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece to be displayed on one level. Once the renovation is finished, the museum's director said, each collection will have its own wing with a separate entrance. The project is part of a $1.8 billion project to renovate Museum Island, the site of the Pergamon and other museums, which attracted 800,00 visitors last year.

The contract would be worth $1.6 billion in 2008 to Empire, now a subsidiary of WellPoint. The comptroller's office said that Empire, formerly a nonprofit insurer, was given an unfair advantage in the bidding process by being allowed to change its bid three times. The company will be allowed to provide drug coverage through the end of 2007 to avoid disruptions in worker benefits, but the contract will be re-bid for 2008.

2006-02-28,World Briefing | United Nations: U.S. Rejects Rights Council Proposal,"John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, said that a compromise proposal for a new Human Rights Council for the United Nations released last week was not acceptable and that the United States would vote against it unless negotiations were reopened or the vote postponed. Jan Eliasson, the president of the 191-member General Assembly who drew up the new blueprint after months of contentious debate, has called for an Assembly vote as early as this week. The new council would replace the discredited Human Rights Commission, where seats are often held by well-documented human rights abusers. The proposal, which was criticized by Mr. Bolton when it was made public last Thursday, drops a requirement that members of the new council be elected by a two-thirds vote, calling instead for a majority of all Assembly members.
