2019-03-01,The Eagles of Reelfoot Lake,"TIPTONVILLE, Tenn. — In the far northwest corner of Tennessee, just this side of the Mississippi River, lies a landscape like no other. Reelfoot Lake is less a lake than a system of bayous, creeks and swampland connected by areas of shallow open water. It was created in the winter of 1811-1812 when a series of powerful earthquakes and aftershocks caused 15,000 acres of cypress forest to sink. The waters of the Mississippi River rushed into the depression. To eyewitnesses, the river seemed to be flowing backward.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/opinion/the-eagles-of-reelfoot-lake.html

2019-03-01,See How Margaret Atwood and Jonathan Lethem and More Draw a Bunny,"I started this 10-second rabbit project a little over a decade ago as a way of channeling the artistic curiosity of the inspiring people around me. At parties I’d collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then we’d guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they’re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They’re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn’t asking for serious art. Still, they’d often protest, “I can’t draw!” before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: “This is great!” she said, adding a carrot. Others (I’ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a “here goes” as I counted to 10.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/books/sabra-embury.html

The third installment of the American series, “Rings” (2017), was a minor commercial success and a massive critical flop. For now, the franchise appears to be on pause.

2019-03-06,The Next Generation of Stone Tools for Your Face,"There are high-tech beauty devices — flashing LED-light firming masks, pH-measuring patches — and then there are the antitheses: simple stone tools that can stimulate circulation and impart a rested, youthful effect simply by being glided across the face (no plug required). Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves “scraping” the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so “can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes — and provide a calming effect,” says Dr. Wexler. Without an on-off switch or any visual cues, though, these implements require a bit of practice. Here, a quick guide to stone-tool facial massage.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/t-magazine/stone-facial-tools.html

The artist, too, is about to set out for a journey. Known for his visceral abstract oil paintings, Otero, 38, who has lived in New York for almost a decade, will open a second studio in his first home, Puerto Rico, early this summer. “I want to see what can happen if I am physically there, working and engaging with people,” he explains. “I’ve always been a loner and introvert while making art, and I want to break this habit there, and maybe even bring people into the studio to make art together.” He’s hopeful about the revitalization of the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. He believes good can come out of catastrophe, and adds: “A lot of young people are bringing amazing things back to the island.

Their representation is small and growing only marginally — in 2007, women in uniform made up 14.4 percent of the force — and their stories tend to be ignored in favor of legacies left by men who have shaped the narrative of service to country. Despite being overlooked, servicewomen are forging new career paths for themselves and the next generation as they enter jobs that were once closed to them. Consider pioneers like Capt. Rosemary Mariner, who was one of the first female Navy pilots in the 1970s and the first woman to lead a naval aviation squadron. She died in January from ovarian cancer, and her memory was honored last month with a flyover using all-female pilots. Or First Lt. Marina A.

She had been the first woman to join the I.R.A. as a front-line soldier — leading bombing raids, targeting people for execution. She was a very dramatic, impetuous figure.” Keefe says he “was so intrigued by some of the details in the obituary that I wanted to see where they went.” Where they went, it turns out, is straight to the notorious 1972 kidnapping and murder of Jean McConville, a widowed Belfast mother of 10.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/books/review/patrick-radden-keefe-say-nothing.html

Even the prominent atheist Sam Harris turns to the meditational exercises of Buddhism in his best-selling book “Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion.” This is understandable, since Buddhist meditation practices can be employed to great effect for secular ends. In particular, there has been success in adapting various forms of meditation techniques for cognitive therapy as well as for practical forms of compassion training. If you learn Buddhist meditation techniques for such therapeutic purposes — or simply for the sake of having more strength and energy — then you are adapting the techniques for a secular project. You engage in meditational practices as a means for the end of deepening your ability to care for others and improving the quality of your life.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/opinion/why-mortality-makes-us-free.html

When a non-Chinese person comes in, he or she is usually given the dinner menu. The dinner menu is considerably more expensive and does not have the low-cost luncheon choices. We know this, and so we always ask for the lunch menu, which they bring without a problem. However, a majority of other non-Chinese (usually foreign tourists) who come in do not know about the lunch menu and spend more than they need to. I am always tempted to tell them to ask for the lunch menu. Would that be an ethically sound decision?

The series is part of a naturalistic downshift in reality TV; it features neither overt competition nor narrative arc. It simply follows a person going on five blind dates over the course of a week, and then choosing one person to go out with again. The five dates must know they’re being judged against one another, but the show avoids acknowledging this, and the dater’s deliberations are never shown. To the extent that anyone on the show is looking for love, they’re doing so casually, nonaggressively, realistically.

It’s essentially a robust rainbow trout that has spawned in fresh water rivers and streams but then, like salmon, has gone out to sea, where it grows bigger, with typically orange-red flesh. In the wild, it is a federally protected species, with a regulated commercial fishery. There is some recreational steelhead fishing in New York State and the surrounding areas because rainbow trout was introduced from the West about 150 years ago. Now steelhead is being farmed in an indoor facility upstate, Hudson Valley Fisheries, where it can reach nearly seven pounds and is raised without hormones, antibiotics and parasiticides. Chefs have started using it, and it’s sold for home cooks.

2019-03-20,"The Pioneers of Postmodern Dance, 60 Years Later","ON A MID-DECEMBER morning at her home studio, which is perched on a wooded hill near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., the 98-year-old dance artist Anna Halprin was leading a movement class. “Think about positive and negative space,” she said, observing from a director’s chair as her 12 students — a retired preschool teacher, a fine-linens importer — assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not. One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin’s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature. Once outside, a pair of students inspected some overhead branches and then offered full-body impressions of leaves rustling in the wind.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/t-magazine/postmodern-dance.html

2019-03-20,Why Tim O’Brien Agreed to Write for ‘This Is Us’,"When the creators of “This Is Us” decided they wanted the third season to explore one of its key characters’ experiences in the Vietnam War, they knew they had to bring in some support. “We were determined to get it right,” according to Dan Fogelman, the show’s executive producer. The choice of whom to tap was not hard. In June 2018, NBC announced that Fogelman’s “literary hero,” Tim O’Brien, would join the show as a consultant. He ultimately took on a bigger role and joined the writing staff, according to Fogelman. O’Brien’s books about the Vietnam War have sold more than six million copies, won numerous awards and repeatedly been recognized as some of the most important works of American fiction of the 20th century. “The Things They Carried,” probably O’Brien’s most famous work, which he didn’t publish until 1990, conveyed his intimate experiences as an American draftee through haunting short stories that explore the physical and emotional baggage that the soldiers of Alpha Company carried with them in Vietnam. In many ways, his episodic, character-driven storytelling style was a natural fit for “This Is Us.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/magazine/tim-obrien-this-is-us-vietnam.html

With figures who recline, make love or smoke a hookah in luxurious interiors or hidden gardens, Mr. Gardner’s subject may be reverie or maybe indolence, solitary or not, clothed or nude, at home, but mostly, it seems, abroad. Perhaps he intends these quiet carefree scenes to distract us from how carefully he engineers every composition. If so, he succeeds: It takes a while to understand their formal complexity.

By the early 1800s, though, the river port was supplanted by Danang to the north, and largely forgotten.

The result is the Galop d’Hermès, a range of sleek women’s watches, in either steel or rose gold (inlaid diamonds optional), with a stirrup-shaped face inspired by the luxury brand’s equestrian heritage. Archibong, 35, originally trained as an architect but is now best known for his work as a furniture and lighting designer, creating sculptural glass pendant lamps and curvy steel chairs with chubby upholstered seats. Four years ago, when he met Philippe Delhotal — the creative director of Hermès Horloger, the Paris-based company’s watch division — his career took another unexpected turn. Delhotal invited Archibong, then a recent graduate of the prestigious L’École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in Switzerland, to create a timepiece for Hermès, and the designer subsequently spent time in the brand’s private archives outside of Paris before developing the Galop, whose case evokes the aerodynamic curves of a racehorse.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/t-magazine/ini-archibong.html

A group of artists, academics and medical professionals now maintain a resource-rich version of the website (graphicmedicine.org), sponsor an annual international conference and oversee a book series. In 2015 they issued the “Graphic Medicine Manifesto,” a part-prose, part-comics title this paper reviewed favorably. Williams, one of the manifesto’s authors, is now out with his second book of graphic fiction, THE LADY DOCTOR (Penn State University, $24.95), which, like his first, “The Bad Doctor,” is set in a small town in Wales and offers the engrossing perspective of a hard-working and fallible physician. Lois Pritchard, 40, single and a secret smoker, wears a sharp black bob and pointy high-heeled boots.

While Africa Command would not confirm to The Times its use of ground-attack aircraft in the region, Amnesty International found photographs of an American airstrike site that showed the remains of a GBU-69 Small Glide Munition, a bomb that can be dropped only using a C.L.T., which in this instance was fitted to an AC-130 gunship.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/magazine/airstrikes-somalia-glide-bombs.html
