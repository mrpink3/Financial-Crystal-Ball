Gioia, kept an office for the past eight years. Mr. Van Bramer, 40, a former Queens Borough Public Library official, decided to keep the place, Suite No. 203. Mr. Gioia left Mr. Van Bramer a welcome note in the drawer of the big desk, along with this advice: Lock the windows and doors. The office had been broken into twice (burglars, not political operatives). The first time, the computers were stolen, which was problematic, Mr. Gioia said, because as chairman of the Council’s Oversight and Investigations Committee, he had some sensitive information on those hard drives. As a worker changed the locks, Mr. Van Bramer surveyed the clutter of desks, phone wires and supplies. Ah, the glamour of public office. He said he would modernize the dingy décor with a hasty repainting and recarpeting job, and update Mr. Gioia’s poster of Mookie Wilson, a Mets center fielder in the 1980s, with one of himself standing with José Reyes, the team’s current shortstop.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/nyregion/03open.html

This has been a luxury at times — especially when you lose five of your last six against F.B.S. competition — and unfortunate at others, such as during a 5-0 start. Northwestern, which actually lost to Syracuse, can commiserate with Auburn’s up-and-down play.

But it is also in contention for a more dubious award: worst timing for the launch of a high-end tourist-and-advertising venture. In 2007, the Bay Area seemed ideal for all three of the company’s planned revenue streams, from fees for scientific research to its $495-per-head tickets.

The general feeling is that teams from the Big Ten lack the team speed to stay with teams from the SEC. To be honest, it’s difficult to argue with that stance.

2010-01-04,U.S. to Investigate Trade Dispute Over LCD TVs,"The Samsung Electronics Company’s latest patent-infringement claims, which seek to block United States imports of LCD TVs made by the Sharp Corporation, will be investigated by a trade agency in Washington. The federal International Trade Commission said this week that it would investigate the complaint, which was filed Dec. 1. The case is part of an escalating two-year legal battle between the two companies over inventions used in liquid-crystal display televisions. The Samsung patents relate to the way LCD screens portray the black and white portion of images. Samsung is seeking to block imports of Sharp Aquos HDTVs made in Mexico. Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, won an earlier trade commission order banning Sharp televisions from the United States. That case is on appeal. Sharp continues to import its televisions, saying it has altered the product to avoid using the Samsung invention. Samsung says Sharp is flouting the trade commission’s order. A commission judge, Paul Luckern, said he would hear arguments on the dispute in April and release his findings by July 19.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/business/global/02bizbriefs-USTOINVESTIG_BRF.html

The trade ministry forecasts that the economy will expand 3 to 5 percent in 2010, an estimate reiterated by Mr. Lee. Singapore joined other Asian nations in emerging from a global economic slump last year after the region’s governments unveiled about $1 trillion in stimulus measures to spur growth. Still, a sluggish recovery in overseas demand for goods could moderate growth prospects in the coming months, the government said in November. The economy grew 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Mr. Lee said. That compares with the 3.8 percent median forecast of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

The Animal Protection Institute, along with Tom Rider, a former Ringling animal trainer, had accused the circus of abusing its Asian elephants by using bull hooks  tools with a sharp steel hook at one end used to control the animals during performances  and of leaving the elephants chained for long periods to punish them for bad behavior. During a six-week trial last year in Washington, held without a jury, Feld Entertainment, which owns Ringling Brothers, said that these things didn’t hurt the elephants, and that they were necessary measures to control them and ensure public safety. “This ruling represents a victory for the elephants and a win for the United States Constitution,” said Michelle Pardo, a lawyer representing Feld, “because it reinforces that the federal court is no place to entertain a philosophical debate about whether elephants should be in the circus.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/arts/04arts-JUDGEREJECTS_BRF.html

Nancy Meyers’s romantic comedy “It’s Complicated” (Universal) finished with $18 million, putting it in fourth place with about $60 million total. And though Sandra Bullock was the top box office draw of 2009, “The Blind Side” (Warner Brothers) drew only a little more than $12 million in its seventh week in theaters.

Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington’s preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation’s intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office.

The shop, in a gorgeous Georgian-era pub in Battersea, sells such bottles as the “hypernatural” Sicilian vintages from Frank Cornelissen, who uses grapes indigenous to Mount Etna. “I wouldn’t expect everyone to be as carried away as I was,” O’Mara said. “But we have a lot of regulars now who say that they have difficulty going back to ordinary wines. A lot of them say they feel the difference and seek out these natural wines now.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/tippling-point-natural-wine-bars/

The musical, which is conceived, choreographed and directed by Ms. Tharp, was previously titled “Come Fly With Me” when it was presented at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta last fall, but will be called “Come Fly Away” for its Broadway run. (The show’s press representatives did not immediately offer an explanation for the name change, you dig?) Casting for “Come Fly Away” was not announced; it is to begin previews at the Marquis on March 1 and open on March 25. Mr. Sinatra’s only previous Broadway credit, according to ibdb.com, was a 1975 concert performed at the Uris Theater with Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie. Ms. Tharp (“Movin’ Out”) has previously used Mr. Sinatra’s music in her dance pieces “Once More Frank,” “Nine Sinatra Songs” and “Sinatra Suite.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/tharps-sinatra-show-is-broadway-bound/

He has brought 21 dancers to present a program of repertory works, including two that were created for the company: Twyla Tharp’s “Opus 111” and Benjamin Millepied’s “3 Movements.”",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/urbaneye/05ubn1.html

CBS was third with “60 Minutes” (14.9 million), followed by reruns of “NCIS” and “Cold Case.” Fox was fourth with its animated comedy lineup, including “The Simpsons” (8.7 million) and “Family Guy” (8.1 million).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/arts/television/05arts-WELCOMEHOMEW_BRF.html

It looks specifically at the battleship Arizona, which was sunk that day with a loss of 1,177 lives. “For decades, it has been thought that a bomb dropped by a Japanese aircraft sank the Arizona,” the program’s publicity says. “But the discovery of a group of Japanese midget subs in and around Pearl Harbor has raised questions about the battleship’s final hours.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/what-to-watch-tuesday-midget-submarines-and-george-lucas/

2010-01-06,‘Avatar’ Commandeers Film Piracy Record,"As “Avatar” knocks down box office records, the film has hit another, less estimable milestone: it has become the fastest-pirated movie, according to one tracking firm’s figures. The Times of London reported that “Avatar,” starring Zoë Saldana, right, was illegally downloaded 500,000 times in the first two days of its release and 980,000 times in the first week, citing figures from the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks usage of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent. In the days leading up to the film’s release last month, its director, James Cameron, seemed confident that the 3-D effects would essentially make it immune to piracy, telling The Times of London, “You can pirate a 3-D movie, but you can’t pirate it in 3-D, so you can’t bottle that 3-D experience.” But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: “Avatar” was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the “Twilight” sequel “New Moon,” which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released “Avatar,” seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. “Bootleg copies are unlikely to have much impact,” a studio spokesman told The Times of London. “Seeing the movie in 3-D in a cinema offers an experience that cannot be replicated.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/movies/06arts-AVATARCOMMAN_BRF.html

One Song at a Time” an all-Sondheim program with six musicians at the Café Carlyle beginning this week.

Go for the “simple and succulent food, stripped-down cooking served in Spartan conditions. Just like at Gordo, Dos Toros has a short menu, high standards and such satisfying fare you don’t mind the hospital lighting.” Also look out for other Left Coast details: “the biodegradable corn-based utensils, the aggressive composting policy, the disarmingly nice staff.” It will make you feel like you’re in sunny California, at least until you walk back outside.

The Chinese movies “Nanjing! Nanjing!” (also known as “City of Life and Death”), about the Japanese occupation of Nanjing in 1937, and “Quick Quick Slow,” were withdrawn, according to China’s state-run Beijing Times, because the Palm Springs festival plans to screen a movie called “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom.” That film, a documentary by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, follows the Dalai Lama for a year, and its description in the festival’s program said that it chronicled “the 2008 protests in Tibet, the long march in India, the Beijing Olympics and the breakdown of talks with China.” A representative for “Nanjing! Nanjing!” said that the films were pulled on the order of China’s ministry of foreign affairs, its film bureau and the consulate general of China in Los Angeles.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/in-protest-chinese-films-pulled-from-palm-springs-festival/

The Guardian reported that Hole, the vintage-1990s grunge-rock band led by Courtney Love, announced on its Facebook page that it would play three European shows next month, starting with a performance on Feb. 17 at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London. The concert dates are also listed on a Web site for “Nobody’s Daughter,” an album that was once planned as a solo project for Ms. Love but was rebranded as a Hole album last year (and is still without a label or a release date). The Guardian said that the new lineup of Hole would include Ms. Love, the guitarist Micko Larkin, the bassist Shawn Dailey and the drummer Stu Fischer. It was unclear if Ms. Love’s former bandmates Eric Erlandson (who has previously declared “there is no Hole without me”) and Melissa Auf der Maur (who has said of Ms. Love, “She’s a nutbag and I really do care about her”) would be involved.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/courtney-love-to-continue-the-hole-story/

Vito Franco, a professor of pathological anatomy at the university, told The Times that he had spent two years examining people depicted in art masterpieces for evidence of disease and illness. Among his diagnoses, Dr. Franco said that Mona Lisa may have had high cholesterol, possibly evinced by a buildup of fatty acids under her skin, as well as a benign tumor in her right eye. He also said that the 5-year-old Infanta Margarita depicted in Velázquez’s painting “Las Meninas” might have had McCune-Albright syndrome, a genetic disease that affects bones, and the Virgin Mary in Piero della Francesca’s “Madonna del Parto” has a goiter on her neck.

The Bob Barker, a 1,200-ton vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the group featured on the Animal Planet series “Whale Wars,” was among the ships that tried to stop a Japanese whaling mission in waters near Antarctica. Mr. Barker, 86, donated the money for his namesake ship after meeting the Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson through a fellow animal advocate. “He said he thought he could put the Japanese whaling fleet out of business if he had $5 million,” Mr. Barker told The A.P. “I said, ‘I think you do have the skills to do that, and I have $5 million, so let’s get it on.’ ”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/arts/television/07arts-BOBBARKERWHA_BRF.html
2010-01-07,Broadway Move Delayed for ‘Orphans’,"A consortium of producers plans to transfer the Off Broadway production of “The Orphans’ Home Cycle” by Horton Foote to Broadway in the fall, rather than rush the show to Broadway this spring as had been discussed in recent weeks, two theater executives involved in the decision said on Wednesday. The producers had an opportunity to move into the Neil Simon Theater this spring for a limited run, but decided they needed more time to prepare the transfer, said the executives, James Houghton and Michael Wilson, who are the respective artistic directors of the Signature Theater Company and Hartford Stage. The play, a co-production now running at Signature through March, was the last work by Foote before he died last year, and is based on the lives of his parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s; the intention is to transfer the full cast, including Bill Heck and Maggie Lacey, above. Daryl Roth, a lead member of the consortium planning the Broadway transfer, said that the producers wanted more time to lock in group ticket sales, scale the production from the 160-seat Signature space to a larger theater, and develop a marketing plan for “Orphans,” which is a three-part play that runs nine hours and lacks star actors.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/theater/07arts-BROADWAYMOVE_BRF.html

2010-01-07,Behind the Scenes in Costa Rica,"I actually hadn’t intended to write today’s column; it was a bit of an accident. Originally when I booked my Central America trip I thought I would travel through Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and my plan in Costa Rica was to write something narrowly about its success in health care. But then I chose to spend a bit more time in Honduras and Nicaragua, and everybody seemed to be out of Costa Rica for holiday travel. Since my return flight was from Costa Rica, I went anyway but figured I probably wouldn’t be able to write. (And, frankly, my daughter had come along for the trip in part because of the promise of going to Costa Rica; I didn’t want to be the one to tell her that she would get the Honduran slums and impoverished Nicaraguan villages, but no Costa Rican beach or jungle….)Then a Times researcher, Hilary Howard, sent me the Happy Planet Index report, which I read while driving around the country. The report got me thinking about Costa Rica and happiness. So I poked around, perused the data, and the column took shape. Originally, I thought I would frame the column more in terms of Latin and Caribbean countries doing unusually well in happiness surveys; I was fascinated by the idea that this reflected a cultural emphasis on building social capital as opposed to financial capital. But although it’s an interesting theory, I never found much evidence for it, and so I focused on Costa Rica and the gains it made in education after abolishing its army.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/behind-the-scenes-in-costa-rica/

That’s fine, but all that really matters is whether his scents are any good. Set aside No. 1 Imperial Majesty ($215,000 for 500 milliliters) and Monogram ($14,500 for 30 milliliters), and we’re left with three Clive Christian masculines, all of which are slightly offbeat and rather good.X For Men, created by the talented avant-garde perfumer Geza Schoen under Christian’s direction and launched in 2001, has one of the strangest drydowns I’ve ever experienced. It starts out as a delightful retro, channeling the aftershave used decades ago in Italian barbershops – delicious, aromatic pine with bark of burnished cinnamon. About five hours later, after that burns off, the scent that remains is neutral human breath, warm and strange – and incredibly, almost upsettingly intimate. The barber is inches away, squinting as he trims your sideburns. If you find that he’s a bit too close, simply reapply after a few hours and the ’50s-era pine will return and endure.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/scent-notes-1872-for-men-by-clive-christian/

His tone, all over the extended range of the horn, is dry and dark, often brusque: he doesn’t purr or warble, and he treats vibrato as a special indulgence, like a dusting of shaved truffles. He’s fond of thwarted symmetry and surprising digressions. He knows how to build pressure in a solo, and he does this with such extraordinary technical command that his exertions can feel both heroic and routine.

The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive.

In a statement Darryl Macdonald, the director of the festival, said the films were withdrawn when the festival did not comply with a request from the Chinese to cancel screenings of “The Sun Behind the Clouds.” He added: “We cannot allow the concerns of one country or community to dictate what films we should or should not play, based on their own cultural or political perspective.” The festival said “City of Life and Death,” with Liu Ye, above, in a scene from the film, would be replaced with screenings of “For a Moment, Freedom,” an Austrian and French film about Middle Eastern refugees seeking European visas; and “Sticky Fingers,” a Canadian, French and Spanish comedy about inept gangsters.

In Ms. Gyllenhaal’s latest, “Crazy Heart,” the directorial debut of Scott Cooper, an actor, she plays the love interest of Jeff Bridges’s alcoholic country singer; it also stars Robert Duvall as his old friend and features music by T-Bone Burnett. Yet it very nearly fell to the straight-to-DVD ranks before being scooped up and thrust into the Oscar race late in the year. Now Mr. Bridges is being touted as the best actor front-runner, and, in the year of the 10, the film itself is a dark horse for best picture. (But don’t expect the movie’s good fortune to be reflected in the fortunes of its couple. “Jeff always makes this joke,” Ms. Gyllenhaal said, “like, oh they’re going to get together in the sequel, and it’s going to be called ‘Crazy Liver.’ ”) Here is Part 2 of our conversation; Part 1, now updated with more answers, is here.

For this exhibition — which was inspired by a major ice storm in the Netherlands in 1987 — Somers, a Dutch designer, and Dylan van den Berg, her collaborator in the studio, took everyday objects — a stool, an architect’s lamp, a vase — and covered them in UV Topcoat, a liquid resin that hardens, or “freezes,” when exposed to sunlight, making the objects appear to be covered with a thick glaze of ice. For Somers, the subject was irresistible. “The half-transparent ice connected things in a matter-of-fact and extremely poetic way,” she explained in the news release for the exhibition. It also added another layer of meaning to familiar objects — an idea that permeates Somers’s work, like the Bathboat, a bathtub with the exterior of a rowboat, or the High Tea Pot, which is cast in porcelain from a pig’s skull. “Frozen in Time” runs until March 20.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/now-showing-wieki-somers-on-ice/

It’s a great story: The boy king, in exile after his father’s execution in a populist uprising, grows up to return as monarch, only to face epochal disasters like the plague and the Great Fire of London. Throw in the handsome king’s wandering eye (poor barren Queen Catherine had to put up with Charles’s bankrolling of one mistress after another, as well as the welcoming to court of his illegitimate children); an ABC of conniving ministers (Arlington, Buckingham, Clarendon); and a cluster of brilliant minds (Hobbes and Locke, Milton and Marvell, Newton, Dryden and the inveterate diarist Pepys), and it’s clear why chronicling this vital era became irresistible. But Uglow does more than narrate the dramatic events of the Restoration, a period known, not coincidentally, for its theater, which often parodied royal affairs.

2010-01-08,Sci-Fi Films Oscar-Worthy? Discuss,"One of the (stated) reasons that the Academy moved to 10 best picture nominees this year is to include more populist fare. (The unstated reasons, as Michael Cieply explores in a piece in this weekend’s special Oscar section, have more to do with boosting the telecast’s sagging TV ratings.) Movies like “Star Trek,” which made both box-office-watchers and critics happy, would seem tailor-made for the 10. And “Star Trek” did get one of the 10 slots on the Producers Guild of America ballots, alongside another sci-fi favorite, “District 9.” But, with a few exceptions, like “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” the Academy has historically shown little love to films that explore the futuristic great beyond, the could-have-been past or the alternate-reality present.

2010-01-08,Semantic Time Travel,"  At a glance, it’s obvious that the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary, published in the fall to worldwide lexicographic acclaim, took a lot of work. The two thick blue volumes sort roughly 920,000 words into 797,120 meanings and organize those meanings into 236,400 numbered categories and subcategories. Like Peter Mark Roget’s famous thesaurus, first issued in 1852, the H.T.O.E.D. not only lists synonyms but also provides what its editors call a “modified folk taxonomy” of English’s meanings — carefully placing deity, for example, among the supernatural elements of the external world, while slotting worship among the manifestations of faith in the social world. It draws on the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, as well as a few Old English sources. The task of dicing up the O.E.D. and reassembling it into the H.T.O.E.D. took 44 years, and most of the intellectual labor was performed by humans, working with pencils and slips of paper. A 1978 fire would have proved disastrous if the slips had not been stored in metal drawers in metal filing cabinets.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/magazine/10FOB-onlanguage-t.html

2010-01-08,Prisoners of Parole," IN 2004, STEVEN ALM, a state trial judge in Hawaii, was frustrated with the cases on his docket. Nearly half of the people appearing before him were convicted offenders with drug problems who had been sentenced to probation rather than prison and then repeatedly violated the terms of that probation by missing appointments or testing positive for drugs. Whether out of neglect or leniency, probation officers would tend to overlook a probationer’s first 5 or 10 violations, giving the offender the impression that he could ignore the rules. But eventually, the officers would get fed up and recommend that Alm revoke probation and send the offender to jail to serve out his sentence. That struck Alm as too harsh, but the alternative — winking at probation violations — struck him as too soft. “I thought, This is crazy, this is a crazy way to change people’s behavior,” he told me recently.

News traveled around the community that the woman about whom “Friendly Fire” was written was chartering a bus for anyone who wanted to attend the rally. She filled that bus, at no cost to me and others who wanted to raise their voices in opposition. Before I read Sara Corbett’s essay, I had all but forgotten that moment and would not have been able to recall Mullen’s name. The endless bus trip, the solidarity, the cold and the crowd all come back to me now. It was a small act in a lifetime of actions.

At a news conference for his production of “La Traviata” at the Teatro dell’Opera in Rome, Mr. Zeffirelli said of Ms. Dessi, who was to sing the role of the ill-fated Violetta: “A woman of a certain age and plumpness is not credible in the character.” Ms. Dessi, above, with the baritone Juan Pons, told the newspaper that the director had said “other, more offensive things” about her. She added: “I believe a lot in the physical appearance of the singer. I have always taken care of myself. We should be respected for our voices. To be too thin is not good.” Ms. Dessi’s husband, Fabio Armiliato, who was to sing the role of Violetta’s lover, Alfredo, has also withdrawn from the production. Mr. Zeffirelli, who has rarely been one to hold his tongue, did not back down from his remarks to Ms. Dessi. “I did say she was on the plump side for the part, and she is,” he told The Times of London. “She is not exactly the kind of woman who is likely to die of tuberculosis.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/arts/09arts-SHESINGSINAN_BRF.html

2010-01-11,New York Philharmonic Posts Record Deficit,"The New York Philharmonic has reported a record deficit for last season, $4.6 million, and projects a shortfall of about $4 million this season. Eric Latzky, the orchestra’s spokesman, said on Friday that the reason for last year’s red ink was a shortfall in annual fund-raising amid the recession; the orchestra fell shy of its $25 million goal by $3.75 million. “We are dealing with longer-term deficits now,” Mr. Latzky said. “There is no question that the economic environment has had a significant impact on the New York Philharmonic. We’re looking for solutions for that situation.” Mr. Latzky said some measures had already been taken, including staff salary freezes, scaled-back parks concerts and the use of fewer substitute players. “Our goal is to protect the artistic vision, absolutely, and to build” on that vision, he said. Last season’s budget of $64.5 million has risen to $68.9 million this season. As at any orchestra, the largest expense comes from musician salaries and benefits. The orchestra’s contract expires after next season. Mr. Latzky declined to comment on whether management would seek a reduction in compensation. A recent effort to cut salaries at the Cleveland Orchestra has prompted the players there to threaten to strike.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/arts/music/09arts-NEWYORKPHILH_BRF.html

2010-01-11,Letters: Freelancers and Climate Change,"Re “Times Standards, Staffers or Not” (Jan. 3): The clear intent of the freelancers’ contract seems to be, “You will not accept anything of value not provided by The New York Times.” What payers are covered as “current or potential news sources”? Is there any person or organization that is not at least a potential news source? Even a Stylite Monk sitting on top of a column for 30 years might serve as a source in a story about his motivations or experiences. The policy appears to me to be facially nonsense. A better idea? Have all writers disclose to The Times all investments over $500 and all receipts of value greater than $250, have the list available to me online and let me judge the extent, if any, that their coverage might be influenced. MARK TRENTACOSTECherry Hill, N.J., Jan. 3, 2010 ●It is surprising that The Times would rely solely upon 3M’s reimbursement of travel expenses for Mary Tripsas to condemn her for violating policy, when 3M might have contributed instead to her Harvard Business School research budget (or had its proxy do so) and thus avoided the perception of a conflict. My experience has shown me that it is impossible to avoid all potential conflicts and that some conflicts may actually be productive. I agree that The Times should take a firm stand on the most egregious conflicts, but rather than focus obsessively on avoiding all conflicts, it should also consider the quality of the work produced.I think that it would have been more valuable if you had provided some commentary on the column that Ms. Tripsas wrote on 3M to assess whether and how her writing might have been influenced by the arrangement. That places a higher burden on the public advocate, but one that is appropriate, in my view.STEVE PERCOCOEast Falmouth, Mass., Jan. 3, 2010 ●The policy described in your column, that your that contributors “must be free of even the smallest hint of undue influence,” goes beyond what I feel is necessary to ensure that the “readers have reason to trust our credibility.” Frankly, I am offended that The the Times’s editors would feel I am such a puritan and/or ignoramus as to assume that any junket given to a freelance reporter in an entirely separate matter would taint the reporter’s credibility and objectivity, or that of The Times. I certainly don’t discount the risk of such things happening. Rather, I think that The Times is taking the easy way out. I would respect The Times more if it would allow a limited amount of flexibility in such cases, and itself undertook to determine whether a freelancer’s other activities threatened the credibility of what appeared in The Times. I recognize that part of the problem in the cases you cite is the fact that the freelancers didn’t report their own conflicts, and that is a separate issue from the conflicts themselves. Nevertheless, I remain uneasy that you are unable to live with the mere existence of conflicts. It reminds me of the concept of “ritual uncleanliness” that notionally pollutes all who come in contact with it, which is unworthy of an intelligent and sophisticated society.I have no intention of canceling my subscription, nor of ceasing my regular visits to The Times’s Web site, just because you have gone so far in depriving yourselves, and your readers, of useful contributors as to arguably lower the potential range of your coverage. But a regular and loyal customer nevertheless considers that you have done just that, and would be happy if you eased off just a little. DON THOMASCalgary, Alberta, Jan. 3, 2010 ●Rather than outright disqualification, wouldn’t simple disclosure of the potential conflict — in or alongside the published column — do the job in many cases? That way the reader could decide what weight to give the potential conflict in evaluating the reliability of the information in the column and the worth of the columnist’s opinion. JIM LUTHERMendocino, Calif., Jan. 4, 2010 ●When someone is on the staff of The Times, The Times undoubtedly pays for their travel to important conferences in the field they cover. But if they freelance they must pay for these trips with their own money?Sounds to me like it’s unethical for The Times to hire freelancers, because it’s a cheapskate way of transferring legitimate business expenses from The Times to the worker. The Times should cover these expenses themselves if the paper feels it is a conflict of interest for someone else to cover them (which I agree, it is). Forcing freelancers to pay those expenses when employees get them covered is not fair.ISABEL WALCOTT DRAVESManhattan, Jan 4, 2010●●Scientists and JournalistsRe “Stolen E-Mail, Stoking the Climate Debate” (Dec. 5): With some real intensive investigative research, maybe this is a “three-alarm story.” One way or another, The Times needs to get this one right. If this is a fraud, The Times surely does not want to be the last to acknowledge it. We cannot afford to be wrong on climate warming. If the Associated Press can put 11 staff members on Sarah Palin’s new book, The Times must have the staff to follow through on climate warming — including giving the many highly respectable skeptics a sufficient platform for raising their issues, and sinking or swimming. MIKE BOURISMendocino, Calif., Dec. 6, 2009 ●Why is it that the media at large, and your column in particular, refers to supporters of the human-caused global warming theory as “scientists,” but uses the term “skeptics” (not scientists) for any scientist who rebuts that theory? Are not the physicist Fred Singer and the climatologist Timothy Ball scientists (as well as skeptics)?Should you not describe the two camps as “supporters and skeptics,” or simply scientists? By referring to one group as “scientists” and the other as “skeptics,” you are boosting the credentials of one at the expense of the other. RONALD BREMNER Glen Ridge, N.J., Dec. 6, 2009 ●You missed a major opportunity to explore the difference in reporting on politics and science — and the challenges faced by reporters when science becomes politicized. I’m sure you know that there is broad scientific consensus on the science behind climate change. The latest I.P.C.C. synthesis report is quite clear about the cause and threat. At what point is it O.K. for a credible news organization to stop publicizing discredited theories and individuals? Does there need to be any verifiable proof at all? Or is it O.K. to give a few contrarians equal billing? At what point (if at all) did The Times stop quoting tobacco-industry-funded spokespeople? If we could find a few “scientists” to insist the sun revolves around the earth would we create a man-bites-dog controversy — and give them equal billing? SAM BOYKINQueens, Dec. 7, 2009 ● A deliberate conspiracy to cover up information is hardly ever the problem with The New York Times or any other media outlet. The problem is bias, which is not deliberate, but often unconscious. I have little doubt that The Times will be as conscientious and professional as possible, but because your information is necessarily limited and uncertain, you will tend to favor the data and the interpretations that support your belief in anthropogenic global warming. That’s normal and natural. Bias is a powerful force operating on any journalist. This much has become clear as a result of Climategate: The myth, perpetrated by global warming alarmists, that we have serene, Olympian scientists on the one hand and ideologically driven skeptics on the other is now gone with the global wind. If we are honest and admit the inevitable presence of bias even in the aeries of science, then we must acknowledge that the skeptics have a vital role to play in the debate, especially since it is now clear that we cannot count on the global-warming advocates to check themselves. If nothing else, the skeptics can improve the science of global warming by finding problems for advocates in the science to solve.

But now that a 2006 state law restricting water use for landscaping is finally taking effect, local jurisdictions all over the state must figure out what to do about the issue by Jan. 31. Some are adopting the state’s model ordinance on landscaping and water conservation; others, like Palo Alto and Menlo Park, are trying to come up with their own. Some of these severely limit the extend of lawns in new or remodeled corporate or residential landscapes. Wary of these possibilities and other more draconian drought-driven restrictions, homeowners in high-end lawn-bedecked suburbs like Atherton and Hillsborough are putting in their own wells as insurance against municipal water cutbacks.Taking It Slow and Easy in Sonoma | An Italian group recently honored Sonoma as a “slow city,” providing the livability of a time gone by, with few if any chain stores, enough farmers’ markets and a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly ambiance. But the corollary of being slow seems to be being white and old and rich, judging by the town’s demographics. Which raises some questions: What price is the town paying for its slow lifestyle?

He said the producers should have taken down posters in the theater district that suggest the show is opening soon; the musical’s Web site still says that previews start Feb. 25. The lead producer, Michael Cohl, who took over in November, has said that the production would take place on Broadway sometime this year. Mr. Cumming said it was “a really weird, frustrating thing to be waiting,” but added that based on the music (by Bono and the Edge of U2), costumes and sets that he had seen so far, the musical would be “a new, very exciting experience” for Broadway audiences.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/cumming-says-spider-man-musical-will-be-delayed/

Neither Mr. Deitch, right, nor officials at the museum returned calls asking for comment, but several experts with knowledge of the search said that Eli Broad, the arts patron who pledged $30 million to save the museum when it was on the brink of financial collapse in 2008, reached out to many unconventional art-world personalities, including Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby’s contemporary art department worldwide and Sotheby’s principal auctioneer, as well as Samuel Keller, the art fair impresario who ran Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach until he became director of the Beyeler Foundation in Riehen, Switzerland, in 2006. While the Harvard-educated Mr. Deitch has vast experience working with artists, selling artworks and presenting shows, he has never had a job that involved fund-raising, which is a crucial part of a museum director’s portfolio. He has, however, worn many hats. In 1979 he helped start an art advisory service for wealthy clients at Citibank. He has also been a private art dealer, and in 1996 founded Deitch Projects, which now has two spaces in New York; in 1997 Sotheby’s bought 50 percent of Deitch Projects, a relationship that has since dissolved. Besides running his galleries Mr. Deitch worked at Sotheby’s managing its 20th-century Art Gallery Program for a few years. Among the artists he has represented are Jeff Koons; the Japanese photographer and performing artist Mariko Mori; Dash Snow; and the British team Tim Noble and Sue Webster.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/arts/design/11arts-NEWCHIEFTOBE_BRF.html

In the end, though, “We didn’t think ultimately that any of the submissions was extraordinary enough, given that it’s the World Trade Center fence,” said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the authority. The mural was to have been installed last month on the Church Street fence between Liberty and Vesey Streets, and remain up for about a year. Instead it will be mounted sometime in the spring at Louise Nevelson Plaza on Maiden Lane at William Street. The design has not been made public, but the competition guidelines called for a mural incorporating “bold, colorful imagery reflecting the vibrancy of the thriving downtown commercial and residential neighborhood.” The principals of Sage & Coombe did not respond to messages seeking comment.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/arts/design/11arts-GROUNDZEROMU_BRF.html

Rumors of the show’s end have been circulating for a while, and the current season’s hourlong finale, “Is Miley Saying Goodbye?,” scheduled for March, does not look as if it will provide any definite answers. “It’s one of the things she’s been wrestling with for months,” Mr. Bonnett said, referring to the show’s lead character, “whether it’s time to make a decision to continue being Hannah Montana or just be a regular, ordinary girl.” But Ms. Cyrus seems to have already begun to move on, with breaks in production of Season 4 scheduled around the promotion of her new film, “The Last Song,” in April.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/arts/television/11arts-ENDMAYBEINSI_BRF.html

2010-01-11,Down in the Trenches,"In a press kit for Josephus Thimister’s first haute couture collection in a decade, in Paris on Jan. 24, I came across an intriguing photograph taken for Vogue by Steven Meisel. A millennial portrait of youngish world-shakers, it included Thimister, Hedi Slimane, Veronique Branquinho, Roberto Menichetti, and Miguel Adrover. In a fairly short time, these designers were to move away from the frontline of fashion—Mr. Slimane to photography, Mr. Thimister to Charles Jourdan—while others in the portrait, notably Nicolas Ghesquiere and Hussein Chalayan, were to hold our attention and still others, like Olivier Theyskens, seemed to enter a stage of limbo, between jobs. A number of stars are not included in the portrait—no Alber Elbaz, who was then leaving Saint Laurent for Lanvin, no Phoebe Philo, who was at Chloé at the time, and no Christopher Bailey, who perhaps had not yet proven himself at Burberry. Maybe the only thing group portraits tell us is to beware of group portraits. This is a highly unstable business, as we’ve learned in the last few years.

So I wasn’t surprised the other morning when, thinking out loud, I asked “What shall I do for Recipes for Health this week?” Without missing a beat, he replied, “Burgers.”",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/health/nutrition/11recipehealth.html

Organized by two well-known Milan galleries — Design Gallery Milano and Nilufar — the exhibition features large-scale, mixed-media works that are the latest in Branzi’s continuing investigation of the anthropological, “animist roots” of design. Branzi, who was part of the radical architecture studio Archizoom in the 1960s and was a co-founder of the Domus Academy, feels that in its quest for formal perfection, contemporary design has hit a self-referential brick wall. In these seemingly primitive, totemic pieces, he employs old wood beams (the “big woods” of the exhibition’s title), semiprecious stones, mosaic and a new printing technology from 3M to search for the soul of design between the ancient and the modern.

But following disagreements about the creative direction of the film (Hollywood translation: the script wasn’t so good and there were conflicting casting strategies), Mr. Raimi opted to move on, according to Deadline.com. Rather than move forward with a different director, Sony decided to push the button on a “Spider-Man” reboot that it has been simultaneously developing. In a press release Monday afternoon, Sony confirmed that the next “Spider-Man” movie will take Peter Parker back to high school. The new chapter, written by James Vanderbilt (“Zodiac”), will have a new cast and director and focus on “a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises,” Sony said. The target release date is now summer 2012.

The full-page ads were scheduled to run in both The Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety. For every $100 million it earns at the box office, “Avatar” will “deliver an estimated 40 million tobacco impressions to theater audiences,” said the ads, referring to scenes involving a cigarette-smoking character played by Sigourney Weaver. That estimate of the film’s value to tobacco companies included anticipated home video sales. To date, “Avatar” has taken in more than $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office. In a statement last week, James Cameron, its director, took sharp issue with the notion that the movie advocates smoking simply because it portrays cigarette use. The new advertisements were paid for by Smoke Free Movies, a campaign supervised by Stanton A. Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, with backing from the American Legacy Foundation. The foundation was established with money from a 1998 settlement of legal claims between tobacco companies and 46 states.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/movies/12arts-ADSTOPROTEST_BRF.html

The laissez-passers from Mullah Omar are the only way for health workers to reach the more violent parts of rural Afghanistan in safety. It’s obviously embarrassing to have to carry permission slips from the Taliban, but, hey, that’s just the only way to work in those areas.I think that’s a useful way to think about education in rural parts of Afghanistan as well. Some aid groups are already negotiating with the Taliban about putting schools in certain areas that the Taliban control. The biggest concern for the Taliban has been that boys and girls be separate and that the girls are taught by a woman. Their other big issue is that the school books can’t have a photo of President Karzai. With those conditions they have, sometimes, been willing to allow girls’ and boys’ education. That’s not going to work everywhere, and the Taliban will be more suspicious of schools than of vaccinations — but I think it’s worth trying in more areas.

Vatican Radio said the movie “cleverly winks at all those pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into the religion of the millennium,” adding: “Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship.” The newspaper wrote that for all of the “stupefying, enchanting technology” in the movie, it offers “few genuine emotions.” But both news media outlets agreed, as the newspaper wrote, that the true accomplishment of “Avatar” was its “extraordinary visual impact.” The film is to be released in Italy on Friday.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/the-holy-see-wishes-it-hadnt-seen-avatar/

2010-01-13,Sony Switches ‘Spider-Man’ Plans,"Spider-Man and Tobey Maguire are parting ways. Mr. Maguire was set to reprise his leading role in “Spider-Man 4” in May 2011 with Sam Raimi, right, who directed the first three installments, returning to the helm. But after disagreements about the creative direction of the film Mr. Raimi opted to depart, according to Deadline.com. Rather than go forward with a different director, Sony decided on a “Spider-Man” reboot that it had been simultaneously developing. In a press release on Monday, Sony confirmed that the next “Spider-Man” movie would take Peter Parker back to high school. The new chapter, written by James Vanderbilt (“Zodiac”), will have a new cast and director, and focus on “a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing superhuman crises,” Sony said. The target release date is now summer 2012. Together, the first three “Spider-Man” movies sold over $1 billion in tickets at North American theaters, according to Box Office Mojo.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/movies/13arts-SONYSWITCHES_BRF.html

World War II dramas, the story of a Rothschild baroness in postwar New York, and a crime story co-directed by a Palestinian and an Israeli are all on the bill. Two of the stronger films, according to Stephen Holden, “depart from the beaten path of historical documentaries and feature films, many of which focus on the Holocaust.” One of them is Haim Tabakman’s fateful drama “Eyes Wide Open,” set in contemporary Jerusalem. The film observes the unforgiving response within an ultra-Orthodox enclave to a gay relationship involving one of its own. The other is Adam Elliot’s claymation feature, “Mary and Max,” which follows the pen-pal relationship of Mary Dinkle (the voice of Toni Collette), a lonely 8-year-old girl living outside Melbourne, Australia, and Max Horovitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an obese 44-year-old Jewish New Yorker with Asperger’s syndrome.

The vaguely British barroom, off the lobby of the Ace Hotel, attracts a “bedlam of gastrotourists and scenemakers.” But a visit should not be taken lightly, with an offering of “10 colors of fat,” “excess can become wretched, and fast.” Thankfully, at least for your body’s sake, the restaurant doesn’t take reservations.

And now the earthquake.Poverty always hugely magnifies natural disasters. I saw this first in the terrible 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh that killed more than 100,000 people. The poorest people lived in marginal areas, such as flood plains, and in flimsy huts that were immediately washed away. So they were killed. Those who were better off lived on firmer land in sturdier homes, and after the disaster they were able to afford clean water and medical care for their children. Frequently what kills people in these disasters isn’t just nature but its interconnection with poverty, and in Haiti it’s imperative to arrange not only the earthquake response — digging people out of rubble — but also a public health response by controlling disease and assuring access to clean water for survivors.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/today-were-all-haitians/

As you’d expect from the musician who called himself the Man in Black, this latest album, “American VI: Ain’t No Grave,” is a mix of the mournful and the morbid: in a news release, publicists for Cash said it would include covers of Sheryl Crow‘s “Redemption Day,” Kris Kristofferson‘s “For the Good Times” and Tom Paxton’s “Can Help But Wonder Where I’m Bound” as well as “Aloha Oe,” and an original song called “I Corinthians: 15:55.” Lost Highway Records, which is releasing the album on Feb. 26 (which would have been Cash’s 78th birthday), called it the “final installment” in Cash’s “American Recordings” series, whose first self-titled release was in 1994. (As with other departed artists, this may not necessarily be Mr. Cash’s last posthumous release.) In a statement, Mr. Rubin said the songs on “American VI” were recorded in the months after Cash’s wife, June Carter Cash, died. “Johnny said that recording was his main reason for being alive,” Mr. Rubin added. “I think it was the only thing that kept him going.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/final-album-in-johnny-cash-series-is-coming/

The app also detects where you are in relation to every place in the guide and offers a link to Google maps for directions. Only the listings of restaurants, bars and nightclubs are lacking. They’re all consolidated into one section called Urban Life, which does have appealing suggestions but also gives short shrift to cities with thousands of places to eat, drink and be merry.

One of them would take home the “I’m a Winner” trophy and, more important, win the consulting expertise of the Rooster Design Group. It was the culmination of the company’s first “The Next Big Small Brand Contest for Culinary Genius.” Rooster’s founders, Fernando Music and Fran Gaitanaros, had canvassed the 140 local applicants and winnowed the field down to the final five. They got all kinds. “We had some real head-scratchers,” Music mused. “Insects as nutritional supplements, positioned as a food that was borderline vegetarian. The insect ingredient would either be ground or mixed into the food product whole to make it more accessible and digestible. We also had a team with a perfectly nice product, good flavor profile, but one of the presenters was drunk … that was pretty dark.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/now-branding-the-next-big-small-edible-thing/

Ke$ha, below, a 22-year-old American whose song “TiK ToK” is an unabashed celebration of the liquor-fueled party life, opened at No. 1 with “Animal” (Kemosabe/RCA), which was released last week and sold 152,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Ms. Boyle’s “I Dreamed a Dream” (Syco Music/Columbia) fell to No. 2 with 93,000 sales, bringing its seven-week total to just under 3.2 million. Ke$ha, whose real name is Kesha Sebert, also has a very different audience from Ms. Boyle’s. “I Dreamed a Dream,” which retailers said attracted older customers, has been notable for having a very high proportion of its sales in CDs instead of digital downloads: at least 97 percent have been CDs, far above the industry average. But Ke$ha attracted younger and more computer-savvy fans. Seventy-six percent of the sales of “Animal” were digital, which Billboard said was the most for a No. 1 album. Also on this week’s chart, Lady Gaga’s “Fame” (Interscope) fell one spot to No. 3 with 66,000 sales; Alicia Keys’s “Element of Freedom” (J) is No. 4 with 62,000; and Mary J.

The first runner-up, CBS, still drew relatively large audiences for its crime shows “NCIS” at 8 p.m. (20.7 million) and “NCIS: Los Angeles” at 9 (15.5 million). CBS also won the 10 p.m. hour following “Idol” with “The Good Wife” (13.8 million), which outperformed “The Jay Leno Show” on NBC (6.2 million) and “The Forgotten” on ABC (4.4 million).

The newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, wrote that “Avatar,” which stars Sam Worthington, right, “gets bogged down by a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature,” according to The A.P. Vatican Radio said the movie “cleverly winks at all those pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into the religion of the millennium,” adding, “Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship.” L’Osservatore wrote that for all of the “stupefying, enchanting technology” in the movie, it offers “few genuine emotions.” But both outlets agreed, as L’Osservatore wrote, that the true accomplishment of “Avatar” was its “extraordinary visual impact.” The film is to be released in Italy on Friday.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/movies/14arts-VATICANPANSA_BRF.html

So it may seem like a paradox that another large chunk of my life is spent in one of the world’s most futuristic, collaborative and intensive centers of technological invention — the The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab. But the attractions and complexities of merging these worlds are central to how and why I work, and grow from seeds planted when I was very young.My mom is a Juilliard-trained pianist and a remarkable pedagogue and my dad is one of the pioneers of computer graphics, but it actually took me a while to start combining these fields. I grew up as a cellist, first playing solo Bach, then chamber music (I never particularly enjoyed playing in orchestras), and then, by high school, original composed or improvised music using a wired (or is that “weird”?) transformed rock cello that I created by placing large headphones around the cello for amplification, then sending the sound through tape recorder loops and analog transformation processes.

The high-concept-centric designers, whose light-up swing lamp was on the cover the spring 2008 issue of T Design, came up with their latest project, Re-skinned, while wondering what happens to discarded leather and fur coats. They felt that throwing out the old coats was disrespectful to the animals whose skins made the garments. After some serious thrift-store digging, Cohen and Yamamoto found some likely candidates for their repurposing effort. In their experiments, they found that when the garments were disassembled and laid flat, their backs resembled traditional animal-skin rugs. Each rug is backed with felt and stamped with the BCXSY logo and a serial number for authenticity. At their introduction during Dutch design week in October, some of the rugs were snapped up by Rossana Orlandi for her renowned design store in Milan. And people have already approached Cohen and Yamamoto with their own coats, hoping to take them home again as rugs.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/design-underfoot-bcxsys-coat-rugs/

In a news release, Give on the Go, the fund-raising division of the Miami company Red Fish Media, said its goal was to raise more than $1 million per day. The campaign allows the users of mobile devices to make an instant donation of $5 to Mr. Jean’s Yéle Haiti foundation, a relief charity, by texting “Yele” to 501501. (The charge appears later on the user’s telephone bill.) In a statement, Matt McKenna, president of Red Fish Media, said “100 percent of the donations” are given directly to the charity. The campaign began at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, and Mr. Jean has tirelessly promoted it on his Twitter account, soon after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti about 10 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince.

To that list of detractors you can now add Russian filmgoers, who say the James Cameron movie too closely resembles a literary science-fiction series by the authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The Guardian has reported that the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda ran an article on Monday comparing “Avatar” to the Strugatskys’ “Noon Universe” books: both take place in the 22nd century on Pandora, and the alien species in “Avatar” is called the Na’vi, while “Noon Universe” chronicles a race called the Nave. In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of “Avatar” were “unequivocally reminiscent” of the “Noon Universe” novels, and told The Guardian that “the film is harmful for western civilization.” But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen “Avatar,” and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism.

I used the thinnest, most flexible spatula I own, wedged it halfway under the pancake, letting the other half hang, then turned my wrist and gently laid it down on the other side.

But the Bears’ coach, George Halas, had other ideas. He sometimes put space between Ditka and the offensive line, making Ditka one of the first tight ends to split out a bit and become a receiving threat. As a rookie in 1961, Ditka was the team’s leading receiver, catching 56 passes for 1,076 yards. In 1964, he caught 75 passes.

Its markers, commemorating acts of violence that seem to repeat themselves through the generations in a cruel infinity loop, consist of dark highways stretching to the horizon. Under them lies a dense matrix of remains. The bones of Plains Indians, Confederate soldiers, hard-luck homesteaders and hellbound drunks mix in a democratic necropolis capped by thousands of miles of oily blacktop. These routes, which for some writers promise liberation — an escape into unbounded freedom and possibility — are, for Shepard, roads of no return. Laid out north and south and east and west, they all lead in the same direction: down. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/books/review/Kirn-t.html

To put it another way, what is a noncollusive literature? Is there a poem that isn’t in negotiation, to some degree, with kings, presidents, generals and the people who hold other people’s heads under water just shy of drowning them? The easy answers are yes and no. In America, where we still jones for innocence and ruin, the intertwining of power and art hasn’t generally been a preoccupation of our literature — what a photograph of a meadow might have to do with Guantánamo, whether a play about marriage is connected to the doings of the secretary of state. Joan Didion’s work might trace the meridians of power through private and public lives, but she is a rare breed.

(The charge appears on the user’s phone bill.) In a statement, Matt McKenna, president of Red Fish, said “100 percent of the donations” go to the charity. Mr. Jean has tirelessly promoted the campaign on his Twitter account. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are among the other notable names who are contributing to relief efforts. In a statement on Wednesday, they said their Jolie-Pitt Foundation would give $1 million to the emergency medical operations of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières, which is responding to the devastation in Haiti.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/15arts-EARTHQUAKEIN_BRF.html
2010-01-15,Injured Actor Departs ‘View From the Bridge’,"The actor Santino Fontana, below, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in previews of the Broadway revival of “A View From the Bridge,” said he was leaving the show to make a full recovery from an onstage injury that resulted in a concussion. His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” “View” is to open Jan. 24.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/theater/15arts-INJUREDACTOR_BRF.html

To that list you can now add Russian filmgoers, who say the James Cameron movie too closely resembles a literary science-fiction series by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The Guardian reported that the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda ran an article on Monday comparing “Avatar” to the Strugatskys’ “Noon Universe” books: both take place in the 22nd century on Pandora, and the alien species in “Avatar” is called the Na’vi, while “Noon Universe” chronicles a race called the Nave. In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of “Avatar” were “unequivocally reminiscent” of the “Noon Universe” novels, and told The Guardian that “the film is harmful for western civilization.” But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen “Avatar,” and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/movies/15arts-FORRUSSIANSA_BRF.html

In the past two months, a succession of court decisions in favor of care providers lifted hopes that the judicial rulings might finally turn things around, but the lawsuits have simultaneously shed light on a system that has been cut to the bone. Jill Duerr Berrick, a professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, said, “The supply and demand problem is so pressing that a child services agency is not always capable of finding the type of care that a child needs.” The Excell Center outside Turlock is one place that makes the finances work, but at the price of putting San Francisco children 110 miles from their roots.",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/foster-care-faltering-and-other-highlights-from-fridays-bay-area-report/

Unable any longer to halt this hemorrhage by force, the desperate German leaders gambled that if they let their people visit the West from time to time, they might not wish to flee East Germany at every opportunity. The Politburo official assigned to announce the new rules on Nov. 9, 1989, botched it, giving the impression that the wall had been thrown open.

The teenager  discovered while having a fight with her boyfriend on the street in England  plays Mia, the 15-year old protagonist in “Fish Tank,” “Andrea Arnold’s tough and brilliant second feature,” A. O. Scott writes. In the movie, Mia “moves with such speed and fury that she seems to be trying to flee not only from her bleak surroundings but also from the movie itself.” The film offers a harsh brand of realism, “a world made familiar by the films of Ken Loach, Mike Leigh and other socially conscious anatomists of British misery.” Mia lives with her mother and sister in “a cramped apartment in a British housing project that stands like a cluster of megaliths in the middle of nowhere.” It also stars Michael Fassbender, recently of “Inglourious Basterds,” but it is the performance by Ms. Jarvis that makes this movie “a diamond-hard reflection on the peril and progress of a fragile soul in a bad situation.”",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/urbaneye/15ubn1-1.html

It found, for example, that illegal copies of “Freakonomics,” by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, were downloaded 1,082 times and “Angels & Demons,” by Dan Brown, 7,951 times. The study did not track any titles published by the company’s clients, which would exclude the oft-pirated “Twilight” series published by Hachette. Rich Pearson, general manager of Attributor, said although not every pirated copy represented a lost sale, the potential loss to the publishing industry could be as high as $3 billion.

However, constructors sometimes aim much lower. The record for fewest answers is 52; the record for fewest black squares is 18. Given a choice between the two, my solving preference is for the few-black-squares variety, since the mix of letters and words can still be fairly interesting, whereas a puzzle with few answers will always have a very high common-letter count.

Also, Linda Greenhouse, in the Opinionator, looks at the drama around the Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday to prohibit the broadcasting of trial coverage and the court’s consideration of an appeal by same-sex marriage opponents in Washington State who seek to bar the public disclosure of petition signers.

The one exception has been the “Ocean” series, which from first (“Ocean’s Eleven”) to last (“Ocean’s Thirteen”) was designed to make money and did. But once Mr. Soderbergh could add that particular genre of moviemaking to his résumé  in Hollywood, the franchise is a genre  he put it aside and returned to being the consummate anti-auteurist auteur, bouncing from the guerrilla epic “Che” to the coolly soft-core “Girlfriend Experience” to the comic corporate exposé “The Informant!”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/movies/17soderbergh.html
2010-01-15,Star-Spangled Glamour | Bruce Weber’s ‘All-American’,"For over three decades, the photographer Bruce Weber has defined contemporary American glamour with his editorial and advertising imagery. Weber has also been a prolific producer of books, including “All-American,” an annual almanac of the esoterica that he encounters in his travels. But when he sat down last year to plan the next edition, the world appeared to have shifted on its axis, with many around him struggling to find their feet. “I wanted to put together a series of stories as eclectic and inspiring as you might hear at a late-night party,” Weber says, “because the morning after, you feel a reason to continue, even if you don’t know all the answers.” Fittingly, the ninth volume of “All-American” (Little Bear Press, $140) is a casserole of conceits, from poetry and photojournalism to profiles on the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade and the doomed beatnik pretty-boy artist Bill Morrow. As ever, nature is never far in Weber’s search for the sublime: a paean to Big Sur features the strapping landscapes and characters that have made the place as synonymous with muscular naturalism as Weber himself.

The speech from “Dirty Harry” in which Clint Eastwood says, “You’ve got to ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?” is commonly shortened to “Do you feel lucky, punk?” Michael Douglas’s “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good” (“Wall Street”) is condensed to “Greed is good.” Expressions of James Cagney like “You dirty, yellow-bellied rat” (“Taxi!”) and “Dirty, double-crossing rat” (“Blonde Crazy”) are immortalized as the snappier “You dirty rat.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html

2010-01-15,How Generous Are We to Haiti? 92 Cents Per American Per Year,"I was delighted that the White House denounced as “utterly stupid” the Rev. Pat Robertson’s suggestion that Haiti had suffered its earthquake because it had made a “pact with the devil,” and as “really stupid” the comment by Rush Limbaugh that Americans already donate to Haiti through tax dollars — which many took to mean that he discouraged giving, a suggestion he has strongly denied. In any case, I think those comments may reflect a current that many people think even if they don’t articulate, something like this: Those Haitians have screwed up their country, and we already pour money into their economy. We have our troubles at home, we have our needs, so why should our hard-earned dollars go to support Haitians who don’t help themselves. We’ve already been generous, and it hasn’t worked.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/how-generous-are-we-to-haiti-two-bucks-a-person/

They read Gibbon, Plutarch and Tacitus and looked for parallels: a society burdened by empire, corrupted by wealth, deficient in manly virtue. Lately we have been doing much the same, only instead of consulting the Latin texts we turn to screen epics like “Gladiator,” the HBO series “Rome,” and the 2007 Zack Snyder film “300,” which, strictly speaking, was about Spartans, not Romans, but let’s not be fussy. The cable channel Starz, as part of an effort to expand its slate of original programming, is extending this classical tradition with “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” a 13-part series that starts Friday, and has already taken the unusual step of commissioning a second season before the first one even runs.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/arts/television/17spartacus.html

The report, released on Thursday by NPD Group, said that over all the gaming industry had its best month ever in December, with more than $5.5 billion in sales of software, consoles and other hardware, and that the popular first-person shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 had become the fourth-best-selling game of all time. But for games that involve the use of plastic guitars instead of guns, the picture wasn’t as rosy. The Beatles: Rock Band, which allows players to tap buttons along to the music of the Fab Four, has sold 1.18 million copies in the United States and 1.7 million copies worldwide since its release in September. By comparison, the music game Rock Band 2 sold 1.7 million copies in its first four months of release in 2008, and Guitar Hero: World Tour sold 3.4 million copies in that time.

The building, which is being built by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which opened the first Museum of Tolerance in Los Angles in 1993, has drawn criticism because it is being constructed on a site that was once part of a Muslim cemetery. However, other architects involved in the project say that Mr. Gehry’s resignation was not related to protests over the site, but to financial issues. According to the architecture firm, Kolker, Kolker, Epstein Architects, part of the initial planning team, Mr. Gehry resigned after rejecting a request by the center to reduce the scope of the plan, the cost of which has been estimated at $250 million. Plans for the project were first announced at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 which included the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Gehry and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jerusalem.

When he is not in the pit conducting Verdi’s opera “Stiffelio,” he is onstage singing. He’ll be easy to spot tonight when he performs Verdi’s “Simon Boccanegra.” “As a young man, Mr. Domingo was a baritone,” writes Anthony Tommasini. “He built his top range through hard work, note by note, to become a tenor, a project that turned out extremely well. He has sung some 124 roles so far. Now, for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera, he performs his newest role, for baritone, the title role of Verdi’s ‘Simon Boccanegra.’ For this back-to-the-future adventure, Mr. Domingo will have the support of James Levine in the pit, and a cast including the tenor Marcello Giordani and the soprano Adrianne Pieczonka. Though the plot of ‘Simon Boccanegra’ is nearly impenetrable, in its revised version, which is offered here, the opera is rich with first-class Verdi music.”",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/urbaneye/18ubn-3.html

After a lengthy rain delay, Wickmayer prevailed, 1-6, 7-5, 10-8, to reach the second round. Had she lost, it would have represented a major setback, even though she was not seeded here because of an unresolved dispute over her availability for drug testing. The match was interrupted several times by a summer rain that stalled many of the tournment’s opening-day matches and eventually drove the two women off the court and into the locker room in midafternoon after more than three hours of play. Wickmayer is ranked 16th in the world and had defeated Dulgheru three times last year while climbing the ladder of women’s tennis in the shadow of her Begian compatriots, Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. But Dulgheru, a 20-year-old from Bucharest, fought tenanciously before yielding. ",Sports,https://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/wickmayer-wins-opener-after-mighty-struggle/

As the story goes, he was visiting his linen-backer to restore some old Hepburn movie posters when the linen-backer asked if McCarthy knew Sean Hepburn Ferrer, the actress’s son. “He thought Sean might be interested in buying some of the posters,” says McCarthy. And indeed, Ferrer bought a bunch of them. “That was my first big sale.” The introduction turned into a job for McCarthy as an archivist for the Hepburn foundation, and it prompted him to start his Web-based gallery, offering up some of his 3,000 vintage movie posters for sale. Hollywood and design insiders have quickly caught onto McCarthy’s astonishing collection of rare and foreign posters, many of them far more avant-garde than the standard-issue Hollywood versions. (Check out the Czech edition of “Cool Hand Luke.”) Besides continually adding to his collection, McCarthy (whose partner, Tyler Cassity, owns Hollywood Forever cemetery, where he hosts extremely popular movie nights in the summer) is planning a bricks-and-mortar gallery space to hold screenings and poster exhibitions based on particular stars, directors and genres.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/screen-saver-the-filmart-gallery/

On his weekly radio and television show, Mr. Chávez said, “Those games they call ‘PlayStation’ are poison. Some games teach you to kill.” He added that violent video games are sold by capitalist countries so they can “later sell weapons,” and they “promote the need for cigarettes, drugs and alcohol so they can sell them,” according to Agence France-Presse. In October, Venezuela passed a law making it illegal to sell violent video games, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Chávez has previously criticized Nintendo for promoting “selfishness, individualism and violence,” and that was before the company released New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which is, like, totally impossible.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/postmodern-warfare-chavez-says-playstation-will-teach-you-to-kill/

Mr. Ellis, 26, said in court that he had not intended to defraud the copyright holders of the songs downloaded through OiNK.cd, and that he had set up the Web site “to further my skills. To better my skills for employability.” The site, which did not host any songs itself, facilitated the illegal downloading of more than 21 million music files.

On his weekly radio and television show, Mr. Chávez said: “Those games they call ‘PlayStation’ are poison. Some games teach you to kill.” He added that violent video games were sold by capitalist countries so that they could “later sell weapons,” and that they “promote the need for cigarettes, drugs and alcohol so they can sell them,” according to Agence France-Presse.

A weary-looking Mr. Jean, who was born in Haiti and recently returned from a visit there, said in the video that he had “always been committed to the people” of that country. He is scheduled to be a host of “Hope for Haiti,” a benefit telethon that will be on many networks on Friday. In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Jean reiterated his defense of the foundation. “Have we made mistakes before?” he said. “Yes. Did I ever use Yéle money for personal benefits?

About 20 million watched in 2007, while the show’s high-water, mark came in 2004 with about 27 million viewers. NBC said the audience was its largest in the time period, excluding sports, in six years. Opposite the Globes and the eighth-season debut of Fox’s “24,” CBS appeared to lead Sunday night’s ratings over all largely because of an overrun of its coverage of the National Football League playoff game between the New York Jets and the San Diego Chargers. CBS drew more than 30 million viewers for the final hour of the game, at 7, helping to raise audiences for the network’s lineup that followed, including “60 Minutes” at 8 (16.7 million), “Cold Case” at 9 (10.7 million) and a rerun of “NCIS” at 10 (9.6 million).

2010-01-19,Food for Thought | Copenhagen’s Coolest Dinner Theater,"I love food, but I never actually wept over a meal until dessert at a former beer warehouse in Copenhagen last summer. I was at Madeleines Madteater — a kind of interactive dinner performance staged every few months in the neighborhood of Islands Brygge — eating nougat semifreddo while tightly wrapped together with a group of Danes in a stretchy white shroud, behind which waitstaff crept, caressing my back and pressing ghostlike faces through the fabric. There were lyrical strings and a dramatic chiaroscuro and a dancer undulating on the serving dais, and it was all gemütlichkeit, and ritual, and the sadness of endings, and — yes, I know this makes no sense. You had to be there. That is the point. It’s art you experience with all five senses, the most satisfying performance in town. Madteater is precisely as its name translates: food theater.Unsurprisingly, Madeleines is named for Proust. The project, which started in 2006, is a collaboration between the chef Mette Sia Martinussen and the film production designer Nikolaj Danielsen, along with a board of directors that includes an anthropologist, a psychotherapist, a couple of artists and a neurology professor conducting research into the senses. But this is no gimmick; it’s still very much about the food. Martinussen has long occupied a prime spot in the Modern Scandinavian cooking scene. She co-owned the experimental restaurant Ester & Soja with Claus Meyer, the chef of Copenhagen’s beloved Noma. And in 2001 she and Danielsen opened a conceptual dining room called 1.th (“First Floor to the Right”), following it the next year with the experimental traveling restaurant MetteSias Sommerbus.

2010-01-20,Is Poe to Be Toasted Nevermore?,"“There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told,” Edgar Allan Poe wrote in his 1845 short story “The Man of the Crowd.” And since 1949 one such secret has attended Poe’s final resting place in Baltimore at the Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, where a black-clad figure has shown up annually early on the morning of Jan. 19, the author’s birthday, to raise a Cognac toast to his grave and deposit three red roses, along with the remnants of the Cognac bottle. But the visitor  whose identity, or identities, has never been revealed, despite some claims to the contrary over the years  failed to show up this year for the first time, ending a strange crepuscular tradition and disappointing a crowd of more than 30 people who forfeited a good night’s sleep to witness the visitation. “I was very annoyed,” Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House, told The Baltimore Sun. “I’ve been doing this since 1977, and there was no indication he wasn’t going to show up.” Some conjectured that the Poe Toaster, as the visitor has come to be known, might have just had the flu or car trouble. But Mr. Jerome spoke with a Poe-ian air of finality. Last year was the bicentennial of Poe’s birthday, he said. “And if it was going to end,” he said, “that would be the perfect time to end it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/books/20arts-ISPOETOBETOA_BRF.html

Jean Tschumi, who died in 1962 at 57, helped influence modern architecture and design in the mid-20th century and became an influential figure in architectural education and practice. The works on paper range from Mr. Tschumi’s early work while a student in Paris to his last project, the Nestlé headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland. With this gift MoMA becomes the only institution outside of Europe to house a collection of drawings by Mr. Tschumi; the majority of his drawings are in the Archives of Modern Construction at the Lausanne Polytechnique, whose architecture school Mr. Tschumi founded in 1942, and in Basel in the collection of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, formerly Sandoz, for which Mr. Tschumi built headquarters and laboratories in Switzerland and France. (Mr. Tschumi’s desk for the company director, above.) His notable works include the headquarters building of the World Heath Organization in Geneva. “I think he was very ambitious and at the same time a little ironical about the pitfalls of fame,” Bernard Tschumi said in a telephone interview from Paris on Tuesday. “I think he would have been extremely pleased, but with a twinkle in his eye.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/arts/design/20arts-MOMATORECEIV_BRF.html

The workshop was one of a series that are being held in conjunction with the exhibition “Bauhaus 1919-1933: Workshops for Modernity,” which closes on Jan. 25. “Shout out your first thoughts,” said Ati Gropius Johansen, the daughter of the pioneering Modernist architect and Bauhaus founding director Walter Gropius, who was teaching the Three-Dimensional Workshop. Five people immediately said, “White.”The students were arrayed around a flower-shaped table in the atrium of the museum’s education wing. Johansen had placed one sheet of paper in the center. “What else?” she asked. “It has four sides.” “It has 90-degree angles.” “It is flat.” This last response interested Johansen. She reclined gently on the table. “How is it lying? If this were a person, what would you find yourself doing to it?” Another student blurted out, “It is like a baby.” After 10 more minutes of discussion, Johansen sent the students off with the instruction to create the biggest change in the paper with the least action: one fold, one roll, one rip.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/hands-on-the-gropius-touch/

For D&G, the sport of choice was skiing, which provided a nifty excuse to layer the chunky knits, oversize parkas and furry hats that have been so prevalent. Giorgio Armani, on the other hand, kept his loose, fluid tailoring clean, though he did accessorize every look with bookish glasses and berets.

2010-01-20,Shocking! | The Proto-TMZ,"There are excerpts in “Shocking True Story” (Pantheon), a new history of the infamous and influential celebrity-scandal rag Confidential, that should strike you as straight out of a James Ellroy novel: the built-up glitz and the hard-boiled sleaze, to start, as well as something about the language — full of implication and insinuation, and as tart and pulpy as a blood orange. The author, Henry E. Scott, writes in the book’s acknowledgments that he was reading Ellroy’s “L.A. Confidential” when he became inspired to write about the magazine — which for five years in the 1950s incited paranoia in Hollywood’s bedrooms and boardrooms with tightly sourced, stylized accounts of celebrity indiscretion. At the New York-based magazine’s height — which is to say just before its downfall at the hands of Tinseltown attorneys — it enjoyed a circulation of 9 million. Its pages laid the groundwork for the National Inquirer, E! and US Weekly; indeed, where once went Confidential, now goes TMZ.Not unlike an Ellroy novel, “Shocking True Story” sometimes delights in the macabre, particularly in the long passages it lifts from Confidential’s pages. One article, from the magazine’s November 1954 issue, could almost describe a Jacques-Louis David painting from 150 years earlier: “Police found her nude body in the bathroom of her San Francisco apartment. There was a grim touch of neatness, even comfort, in the way she had met death. After filling the tub with water, she had arranged a stack of pillows around the edge and drowned herself.” The woman’s name was Dr. Jean S. Tatlock, and she was a communist. She killed herself in 1944, some six months after an overnight rendezvous with her former boyfriend, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. This wasn’t news by late 1954, but it did endear Confidential’s charismatic, power-peddling owner, Robert Harrison, to J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I. and the forces of McCarthyism, who at a public hearing earlier that year stripped Oppenheimer of his Atomic Energy Commission security clearance.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/shocking-the-proto-tmz/

2010-01-20,James Patterson Inc.,"Like most authors, James Patterson started out with one book, released in 1976, that he struggled to get published. It sold about 10,000 copies, a modest, if respectable, showing for a first novel. Last year, an estimated 14 million copies of his books in 38 different languages found their way onto beach blankets, airplanes and nightstands around the world. Patterson may lack the name recognition of a Stephen King, a John Grisham or a Dan Brown, but he outsells them all. Really, it’s not even close. (According to Nielsen BookScan, Grisham’s, King’s and Brown’s combined U.S. sales in recent years still don’t match Patterson’s.) This is partly because Patterson is so prolific: with the help of his stable of co-authors, he published nine original hardcover books in 2009 and will publish at least nine more in 2010.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/magazine/24patterson-t.html

2010-01-20,The Great Unalignment,"This time last winter, Democratic Washington was crackling with confident talk of a progressive re-awakening in the land and an enduring Congressional majority. “Realignment” was the word of the moment, as in the kind of demographic and ideological shift that shaped the nation’s politics for some 60 years after the election of Franklin Roosevelt. Now Democrats are trying to figure out how they lost what was presumed to be the safest Senate seat in the country — it belonged to Ted Kennedy for 46 years — and how to avoid hemorrhaging others. A year after George W. Bush’s chopper swung away from the Capitol and disappeared from sight, voters seem to have put his presidency behind them; they’re no longer willing to blame Republicans alone for high unemployment and rising gas prices, for home foreclosures and tuition hikes. The crises that Bush bequeathed to Democrats have now officially become theirs, and the notion of a great liberal realignment seems as retro as Friendster. A string of Democratic lawmakers, largely from rural and contested states, the kind of places that were supposed to now be more hospitable to Democrats than they were before, recently decided to pursue other careers rather than risk being turned out by wrathful voters. Party leaders who had once hoped to expand their majorities in November are now showing signs of panic as they scramble to stave off the prospect of crippling losses.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/magazine/24fob-wwln-t.html

Sony had said that it wanted to return the film series to the teenage roots of the Peter Parker character.

The claim is included in a brief for a planned Friday hearing on whether Mr. Polanski, who in 1978 fled the United States before sentencing on a conviction of having sex with a minor, should now be entitled to sentencing in absentia. “Politics seems to be interfering with the just administration of the law,” wrote Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, Chad S. Hummel and Bart Dalton, in response to a district attorney’s brief arguing that Mr. Polanski should have to appear before sentencing. This month the Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, formed a committee to explore a run for California attorney general. Tuesday’s filing did not specifically mention that possible run for state office, but it said the district attorney’s insistence that Mr. Polanski return to the United States was a “nakedly political” approach to the case. Los Angeles prosecutors have long argued that Mr. Polanski’s fugitive status deprived him of any right to challenge his treatment in California.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/movies/21arts-POLANSKILAWY_BRF.html

Why do you see yourself as a spokeswoman for teenage girls?  I don’t feel like I’m a spokesperson at all for girls. I just feel like, O.K., in the way that “The Vagina Monologues” was an attempt to communicate stories of women and their vaginas, this is an attempt to communicate the stories of girls on the planet right now.

2010-01-21,Time Change | Luxury Watches in Geneva,"I took a brief leave of the catwalks to take in the annual SIHH luxury watch preview in Geneva. The packed hallways and buzzing booths were a welcome contrast to the quiet post-crisis scene a year ago. As usual there were the requisite one-upmanships between brands. Some innovations were astounding, others simply showy. There was an equally strong emphasis on heritage and brand DNA, with many companies focusing on line extensions, as they’re called, or simply slight updates of existing styles. Some industry leaders took a break from bloat and put their watches on strict, chronograph-free diets, “Biggest Loser” style. Piaget’s new Altiplano was recently named the world record holder for the watch with the thinnest automatic movement, as well as the thinnest automatic case. Rival Vacheron Constantin’s new Patrimony Traditionale 1968 was named the world’s thinnest manual winding watch. Finally, Baume & Mercier clocked in with its new Classima Executive, measuring only 4.4 millimeters thick, with a lean price of $1,490 for the quartz-movement watch. These three made strong, sleek statements that can hold their own against more “complicated” competitors. Cartier introduced the Montre Calibre, featuring a chunkier case and the first in-house-designed and in-house-produced automatic movement. A. Lange & Sohne’s Zeitwerk Phantom was inspired by a dinner in the dark held in Berlin during the introduction of the original Zeitwerk. A UV-transparent coating allows the absorption of light by the numerals hidden beneath the face to glow in the dark. Audemars Piguet took cues from the car-racing world for its Royal Oak Offshore Grand Prix. The auto-inspired detailing and graphics, plus a dark forged carbon case and bright red anodized aluminum face, made for a racetrack-worthy watch. In one of the most innovative watches of the show, Montblanc introduced the Metamorphosis, a Transformer-style watch that has to be seen to be believed (and explained). This two-faced watch, the result of a collaboration between expert watchmakers, features two dials that separate to reveal two more hidden dials with chronograph functions. From the chic and seemingly simple to the innovative and complicated, this year’s SIHH confirmed that the vitality of the watch business depends on tradition as much as innovation. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/time-change-luxury-watches-in-geneva/

The Andaz property, part of an entirely new brand for Hyatt, is a far cry from last year’s extremes of old-school opulence and flophouse chic. In June, the unabashedly luxurious Pierre Hotel reopened, flaunting a $100 million renovation and posting room rates of the “if you have to ask …” variety. Then the Crosby Hotel opened, with each of the 86 rooms awash in bespoke fabric and art, and priced to match.

For adults, however, the most disturbing event in this British production will be a rather Victorian sex scene between Darwin and his wife, Emma. Why? Because they’re played by the real-life couple Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly.Sure, we understand: the director, Jon Amiel, wanted to avail himself of the instant intimacy of a married twosome. But who wants to see that? Who wanted to see Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger getting it on in “The Getaway”? Who wanted to cross the minefield that was Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in “Eyes Wide Shut”? Who wanted to see Ed Harris and Amy Madigan (as the painter Jackson Pollock and heiress Peggy Guggenheim) coupling like wildebeests in “Pollock”? O.K., that was pretty funny.

2010-01-22,"Anne Boleyn, Queen for a Day","The story of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII, ended in May 1536, when the master executioner of Calais — sent for specially, and said to be an adept in his art — separated her clever head from her seductive body with one clean stroke of his sword. Historians are still puzzling over Anne’s downfall. Henry had fought for years to extricate himself from his first marriage and create a world where he and Anne could be husband and wife; to achieve it, he had split Christian Europe apart. How did he become so alienated from her that he wanted her dead? Had she really slept with her brother George? Who was the prime mover in alleging against her multiple acts of adultery, involving five men? Was it Henry himself, crediting some slander and lashing out in blind rage? Or his minister Thomas Cromwell, fighting for his own career? What part was played by the papist supporters of the Princess Mary, Henry’s child by his first marriage? Were all these parties, for different reasons, acting together? And at what point was Anne’s doom sealed? Did her fortunes begin to falter in January 1536, when the king’s first wife died and Anne miscarried a child? Or was she brought down over a few days, in an atmosphere of fulminating panic that infected the entire court?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/books/review/Mantel-t.html

But half a mile from shore, we learned why no one else was out. The wind blew up, as did the chop. Our boats got skittish. Marty’s Red Sox cap blew off, and I begged him not to circle back for it.

Proponents of “fixing” this wayward orthography have included some of the most prominent names in American history. Benjamin Franklin suggested changing the alphabet, and Andrew Carnegie provided money for people to study the problem. President Theodore Roosevelt issued an edict in 1906 that gave the Government Printing Office a list of 300 words with new spellings: problem cases like artisan, kissed and woe were to be changed to artizan, kist and wo. Roosevelt was largely ignored by the G.P.O., and the matter was soon dropped.

The museum declined to identify the woman, but said she was not injured. Picasso created the painting, which depicts an itinerant acrobat theatrically posed, during the winter of 1904-5.

In a ceremony on Monday, the Southern Sky Column in Zhangjiajie City, in China’s Hunan province, was formally renamed the Avatar Hallelujah Mountain, Reuters reported, citing the local government’s official Web site. The name change seemed to be an effort to stir up the interest of Chinese tourists, who have helped “Avatar” sell more than $100 million in tickets, breaking box office records in the country. Travel companies have already begun offering tours that emphasize the region’s resemblance to Pandora, the lush alien moon depicted in the film. On its site, the municipal government wrote: “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near.

Mr. Stone’s characters do not have fun. They may get high, get drunk or get loaded, but they are almost always lost, disaffected and desperate. They may visit exotic parts of the world and go on all sorts of wild adventures, but in doing so, they are always courting danger or falling prey to bad faith, bad karma and bad vibes. Even scuba diving or bungee jumping becomes for them existential confrontation with mortality, raising primal questions about courage and angst, life and death, God or his absence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/books/26kakutani.html
2010-01-26,Now Booking | Caribbean Queens,"Despite a still tricky, if rebounding, real-estate market, several luxury hotel brands are throwing caution to the tradewinds with splashy new Caribbean resorts. After a long delay, the Viceroy Anguilla finally made its debut last month, joining the sleepy little island’s outsize collection of high-end hotels. (The Moorish-inspired Cap Juluca still reigns supreme, while the much-touted developments of Temenos and Rendezvous Bay have stalled.) At this latest Viceroy, situated on Mead and Barnes Bays, Kelly Wearstler has created ultradecadent penthouses suites, cabana-lined infinity pools and multiple lounges, among them the Half Shell, carved out of the side of a cliff.In the Turks and Caicos, where construction seems to continue unabated on Grace Bay Beach (for better or worse), the new Veranda Resort, managed by the company that owns the chic Grace Bay Club, begins accepting guests Feb. 1. It might siphon off some of the jet set who’ve been holing up at the nearby Gansevoort Hotel, but probably just a little — the chainlet’s third outpost after New York and Miami has been going strong since last spring.

In a statement the Cannes festival president, Gilles Jacob, called Mr. Burton “a magician of visual delights who turns the screen into a faerie wonder.” He adding, “We hope his sweet madness and gothic humor will pervade the Croisette” in Cannes. Mr. Burton, whose work is currently featured in a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, said in a statement, “After spending my early life watching triple features and 48-hour horror movie marathons, I’m finally ready for this.” The 63rd Cannes Film Festival is to run from May 12 to 23, and film selections are expected to be announced in mid-April.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/movies/26arts-BRAINSBEHIND_BRF.html

Now a mountain there is being renamed for a peak seen in the film. In a ceremony on Monday the Southern Sky Column in Zhangjiajie City, in Hunan province, was formally renamed the Avatar Hallelujah Mountains, Reuters reported, citing the local government’s Web site (www.zjj.gov.cn/website/). The name change seemed to be an effort to stir the interest of Chinese tourists, who have helped “Avatar” sell more than $100 million in tickets, breaking box-office records in the country. Travel companies have already begun offering tours that emphasize the region’s resemblance to Pandora, the lush alien moon depicted in “Avatar.” On its site, the municipal government wrote: “Pandora is far but Zhangjiajie is near. Welcome to Zhangjiajie to see ‘Avatar’s’ Hallelujah Mountains and discover the real world of Pandora.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/movies/26arts-AVATARMAKESM_BRF.html
2010-01-26,‘Buried’ Finds Savior,"On Sunday at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Lionsgate paid an estimated $3.5 million for “Buried,” a Spanish thriller starring Ryan Reynolds as a civil contractor in Iraq who awakens to find himself buried alive in a wooden coffin. His captors have given him nothing but a lighter and a cellphone, which he must use to meet their ransom demand before he suffocates. Tagline: “170,000 square miles of desert. 90 minutes of oxygen.” “Buried,” sold by United Talent Agency, was a hot item for buyers going into the festival for several reasons. Genre films typically don’t have much downside  they are cheap to make and comparatively easy to market. And if that marketing is executed properly they can become phenomena with young audiences. (See: “Paranormal Activity.”) Although he has yet to show he can anchor a movie, Mr. Reynolds is a budding heavyweight.

In a telephone interview, Leslee Dart, Mr. O’Brien’s publicist, said the comedy sketches “all fell within the show’s normal prop and music budget guidelines.” For example, for a skit in which Mr. O’Brien appeared to bring the Kentucky Derby-winning horse Mine That Bird onstage while showing Super Bowl footage on a television screen, Ms. Dart said, “the horse was a standard rental and the Super Bowl footage wasn’t from the N.F.L.” For a segment in which Mr. O’Brien showed off an expensive Bugatti Veyron automobile while playing the Rolling Stones song “Satisfaction,” Ms. Dart said, “The Bugatti was loaned to the show for free, and the music clearances were no different than the show gets for other pop tunes all the time.” ?uestlove, the bandleader on NBC’s “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,” had written on Twitter that it cost “The Tonight Show” $500,000 to play the Beatles song “Lovely Rita” when Tom Hanks appeared on the show on Friday. But a representative for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which handles the Beatles catalog, said that it cost the show only a “nominal fee.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/arts/television/26arts-OBRIENNOTLAU_BRF.html

The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that the event at the nightclub, the 501 Lounge, drew an estimated 2,000 fans to the 800-person-capacity club. “They had crowds much larger than they could control,” David P. Sabagh, the Montclair police chief , told The Star-Ledger. “They had 600 upstairs, 200 to 300 downstairs and 400 outside.” He added, “There were fights inside and fights outside.” Chief Sabagh said that four people had been arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and drunken driving.

By comparison, CBS and ABC, which finished in a virtual tie for second place, struggled to top 8 million viewers for a single program. ABC averaged 7.8 million viewers for “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” from 8 to 10, while a rerun of “Desperate Housewives” at 10 drew 4.2 million. CBS earned 7 million at 7 for a special “60 Minutes” tribute to that newsmagazine’s former executive producer Don Hewitt. CBS broadcast crime show repeats from 8 to 11, including “CSI: NY” (5.4 million), “Cold Case” (6.1 million) and “CSI: Miami” (7.2 million).

Amid the displays of silk, satin and spandex costumes, visitors are also promised re-creations of the band’s recording studio and the seaside cabin where Mr. Ulvaeus and Mr. Andersson composed many of the band’s hits; an exhibition that allows aspiring performers to sing and dance alongside an animated version of the band; and an audio guide recorded by Stellan Skarsgard, the Swedish actor who starred in the film version of “Mamma Mia!” Magnus Danielsson, the president of Touring Exhibitions, the company behind the museum, told The A.P. that the guiding principle behind its design was,”How do we give the visitor a big hug in each room?” He added that he was a big Abba fan growing up, but switched to hard rock when he changed schools.

As a result, people have for days been trickling in to American cinema’s annual indie bacchanal, and when they finally got here, they found more snow in Park City, Utah, than during any Sundance in years — a constant, muted downfall that didn’t let up until Sunday but that certainly didn’t stop the hordes of stockingless young women clad in miniskirts and stilettos from swarming into the mush-and-ice covered downtown. Mardi Gras beads were strewn all over Main Street on Sunday morning, which was probably a metaphor for something.

You could see how this latest defeat might have registered on Obama like a horse hoof to the abdomen, shaking him from his prized equanimity and plunging his White House into a spate of uncharacteristic self-doubt. On a personal level, Obama had to feel that he had somehow failed one of his mentors, allowing not only Kennedy’s seat to slip away but quite possibly his dream of national health care too. Politically, the Massachusetts election seems likely to presage worse days ahead, suggesting, as an unending parade of commentators have now pointed out, that Obama and his governing party could face a calamitous November.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/magazine/31fob-wwln-t.html

Instead, Mr. Toibin has gone home a runner-up in the Costa book of the year competition, having lost to a poet. The Guardian reported that Christopher Reid was named the winner of the Costa award for his collection “A Scattering,” about his wife, Lucinda Gane, who died in 2005. Mr. Reid became only the fourth poet to win the prestigious British literary award &#8212 and its prize of about $48,000 — following Douglas Dunn, Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney (who was the most recent poet to claim victory, in 1999). Josephine Hart, one of the prize’s 11 jurors, told The Guardian, “It is a devastating piece of work and all of us on the jury felt it was a book we would wish everybody to read.” In addition to “Brooklyn,” other finalists for the award included Patrick Ness’s children’s book “The Ask and the Answer”; Raphael Selbourne’s first novel, “Beauty”; and Graham Farmelo’s biography of the quantum physicist Paul Dirac, “The Strangest Man.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/toibin-defeated-in-literary-prize-shocker/

Try getting that kind of treatment in New York these days, where austerity is the new black.

She is a confident and poised young woman, who now gets gifted couture hats by Stephen Jones (which received this oddly controversial wearing the day before) and sits front row at Chanel (no big deal). Tavi 2.0 has arrived. And she is major. Farewell, little suburban girl. You will be remembered fondly in the Blogspot archives.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/too-cool-for-school-tavi-grows-up/

2010-01-28,Artist Is Facing Criminal Probe Over His Use of Obama Photo,"A judge revealed in a hearing on Tuesday that a criminal investigation was pending against the artist Shepard Fairey in connection with his use of an Associated Press photograph of Barack Obama, a lawyer involved in the case said on Wednesday. At the hearing the judge,  Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York, denied a motion by Mr. Fairey to delay a deposition in a civil case while the criminal investigation was pending. In a letter obtained by The New York Times, a lawyer for Mr. Fairey also referred to a criminal investigation; also, The Associated Press said it had received a grand jury subpoena in the case. The letter requested that Tuesday’s hearing be sealed, “based on the fact that the motion relates to a grand jury investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office.” The letter, signed by Meir Feder of the firm Jones Day, added that “an open hearing on these issues would risk compromising the confidential nature of the criminal investigation.” That motion was also denied. The legal dispute hinges on whether Mr. Fairey had the right to use an A.P. photo of Mr. Obama for his “Hope” poster. In October Mr. Fairey, at right with his poster, admitted that he had lied in court papers about using a different photograph of Mr. Obama, and that he had created false documents to cover the discrepancy.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/arts/design/28arts-ARTISTISFACI_BRF.html

The store’s atmosphere “has the effect of making its superbly made (and astronomically priced) fetish accouterments look respectable.” If bondage, however well-heeled, is still not your thing try Agent Provocateur, only a few of blocks away from Kiki de Montparnasse, but “considerably closer to the old 42nd Street in spirit.” The vibe is “more user-friendly for embarrassed guys shopping alone and packs of teenage girls; the lights are brighter, the music is dumber, louder and younger. Many items fall into a black and pink, rockabilly hot-rod style. It is, in essence, a vamped-up version of Victoria’s Secret by way of Johnny Rockets, the retro diner chain.” Either way, remember that “Valentine’s Day was originally a time to ritually exorcise evil spirits and restore one’s city to health and fertility,” so do your civic duty.

2010-01-28,A Loss of Faith in Afghanistan,"Tonight, President Obama presented a compelling defense of his strategy to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Following my deployment to the northeastern region of the country in 2006-2007, I arrived at many of the same conclusions as he has over recent months. I believed that the faltering mission required a revamped approach, more troops, and more resources. Dealing with the dysfunctions of the U.S.-led effort, serving in an overstretched unit and suffering casualties in my platoon prompted my initial diagnosis. However, time, distance, and perspective from my experience have forced me to reconsider this assessment.President Obama’s goals are sound. Training Afghan security forces, rewarding good governance, reducing corruption, supporting the rights of all Afghans, and strengthening the international coalition are vital to the fight against Al Qaeda. However, a fatal flaw plagues the counterinsurgency strategy adopted by the president: the more the U.S. and its allies deepen their involvement and commitment in Afghanistan, the more they undercut the Afghan sense of ownership, accountability and sustainability that will determine the long-term fate of the mission. Simply put, his strategy is directly at odds with his goals. ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/a-loss-of-faith-in-afghanistan/

It said, “I will not make any more boring art,” and the pioneering California conceptualist has been as good as his word. Baldessari’s deadpan videos, paintings, photographs and assemblages, which he adapts from existing imagery, provoke laughter, puzzlement and admiration, often all at once. As both teacher and artist, he has inspired several generations of younger artists subscribing to his belief that anything goes in art and everything in the world can be fodder for making it. He ramps up his photographic works — photomontages juxtaposing multiple framed images drawn from television, advertising or film — by masking telltale noses, ears or eyes with floating, brightly colored dots. Museums and collectors have invested in his unique products for a very pretty penny. Now comes a complete compendium of his more affordable limited-edition works, of which a new book, “John Baldessari: A Catalogue Raisonne of Prints and Multiples, 1971-2007,” is one.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/john-baldessari-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink/

A Chinese city is backing away from reports that it renamed one of its mountains for those floating peaks from the James Cameron film, amid complaints that the city was caving in to Western cultural influences. On Monday, the government Web site of Zhangjiajie City in Hunan province said that it had changed the name of its Southern Sky Column to Avatar Hallelujah Mountains; the change was apparently an attempt to capitalize on the success of “Avatar,” which has earned more than $100 million in China. But according to Reuters, a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency said that the decision was unpopular with city residents, who “accused officials of being money-oriented and blindly worshiping Western culture.” A local tourism official told Xinhua: “We only added a way to call the mountain. The previous name is not abolished.” China is historically wary of the effects of Western culture, and recently pulled the 2-D version of “Avatar” from many movie theaters, despite the film’s popularity there.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/chinas-avatar-mountains-come-crashing-back-to-earth/

2010-01-28,Molto Triennale | A New Design Museum,"The scene Tuesday afternoon at the TriBeCa offices of the Italian television network RAI International was, perhaps not surprisingly, a little like RAI’s distinctive brand of programming: leisurely, charming, chatty, full of attractive personalities and, for English speakers anyway, slightly baffling. But not necessarily in a bad way. The event was billed as a send-off for “Roy Lichtenstein, Meditations on Art,” an exhibition of more than 100 works by the late Pop artist opening that day at the Triennale museum in Milan. But the 50 or so men and women milling around a red-carpeted 25th-floor meeting room sipping Pellegrino and speaking fluent Italish were there for what proved to be bigger news: the official announcement that the Triennale — the impressive 87-year-old design-focused institution — will open a New York satellite exhibition space, Triennale NYC, this spring.A live closed-circuit TV hookup with the Triennale in Milan — think giant projection-screen Skype — yielded a series of disconnections, pixelated greetings back and forth across the Atlantic (“saluti a tutti!”) and halting moments of unclear protocol, but the crowd took it all in with breezy bella figura. On the screen, there was the Triennale president Davide Rampello at the museum in Milan, and in the room an array of Italian-culture panjandrums, including the Italian Consul General Francesco Maria Talò, the RAI director Massimo Magliaro and Roberto “Bobo” Manzoni, a veteran Milanese businessman who has been guiding the Triennale’s effort to scope out potential new locations, à la the Guggenheim, around the world. Manzoni said that a visit to MoMA in December 2008 gave him the flash of inspiration that allowed him to “follow a dream”: to open Triennale NYC across West 53rd Street in what was the home of the Museum of Arts and Design (formerly the American Craft Museum) from 1986 until 2008, when it moved to new quarters in the remade 2 Columbus Circle.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/molto-triennale-a-new-design-museum/

But the movie, from the first-time writer-director Spencer Susser, struck a chord with fanboys (“I feel like I just had my brain thrown in a blender, splattered with hot sauce and nails,” was one Twitter review). “I flat out loved HESHER,” wrote Quint at Ain’t It Cool News. “For tone and sheer ballsy entertainment this one is going to be hard to top during my Park City adventure.”",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/hesher-finds-a-partner/

Nowadays, Old San Juan has a Marshall’s discount store on one of its main plazas, and the island struggles to differentiate itself from other spots in the Caribbean — that is, as a place to hole up in a pool-side cabana between trips to the beach and the breakfast buffet. Which is why Puerto Rico tourism officials have commissioned Erwitt to reprise his 1950s shoot with a new portfolio of images intended to recapture some of the island’s cultural allure (you can read about the campaign in Stuart Elliott’s advertising column). It’s yet more evidence — in addition to the recently revived grand-dame hotels and retro cocktails and velvety old-world passenger trains — that nostalgia is a powerful force in the travel world just now.

On Monday the government of Zhangjiajie City in the Hunan province said it had changed the name of the nearby Southern Sky Column to Avatar Hallelujah Mountains; the change was apparently an attempt to capitalize on the success of “Avatar,” which has earned more than $100 million in China. But according to Reuters the state-run Xinhua news agency reported that the decision was unpopular with city residents, who “accused officials of being money-oriented and blindly worshiping Western culture.” A local tourism official told Xinhua: “We only added a way to call the mountain. The previous name is not abolished.” China is historically wary of the effects of Western culture, and recently pulled the 2-D version of “Avatar” from many movie theaters.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/arts/29arts-AVATARMOUNTA_BRF.html

2010-01-29,Wednesday’s Ratings,"While President Obama commanded the largest network television audiences in prime time on Wednesday for his first State of the Union address, Fox’s “American Idol” dominated the 8 p.m. hour with 24.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s estimates. No other network came close to matching Fox in the 8 p.m. time slot, although both CBS and ABC broadcast comedy reruns, and NBC offered a repeat of “Mercy” (4.2 million). Meanwhile a precise accounting of the president’s audience was not immediately available on Thursday, but preliminary overnight estimates show the speech probably attracted a smaller audience than the president’s first address to a joint session of Congress in February of last year. That speech drew 52.4 million viewers, while Wednesday’s speech, which began at 9 p.m. and lasted until 10:20, appeared to have garnered an audience more similar in size to President Obama’s prime-time address in December about the American strategy in Afghanistan, which drew 40.8 million viewers.

ABC said it will broadcast eight more original episodes, including a series finale. An adaptation of a popular Spanish-language soap opera, “Betty La Fea,” about an unattractive but cheerful secretary at a fashion magazine, “Ugly Betty” was imported to the United States by Reveille Productions and featured America Ferrera, left, as Betty, a role for which she won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for acting in her first season. The initial buzz around the show was strong even before the series premiere, but convoluted story lines alienated some viewers. This season ABC moved the series to Friday nights, where ratings fell dramatically, before shifting the program to 10 p.m. Wednesdays after the cancellation of “Eastwick.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/arts/television/29arts-AFTERRATINGS_BRF.html

At least that’s what happened to the Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, the Austin, Tex.-based auteurs of the mumblecore genre (“The Puffy Chair” and “Baghead”). They hit Sundance this year with their first mainstream film, “Cyrus,” developed for and distributed by Fox Searchlight. The feature, their first to crack 90 minutes (“only because our credits are like five minutes long,” Jay said) was largely improvised; it stars John C. Reilly and Marisa Tomei as a couple whose relationship is threatened by her adult son, Jonah Hill, in the title role. The Bagger liked it and so did many others at Sundance; it won unofficial best-of polls  and even had some watchers talking Oscars – pretty heady stuff for a couple of dudes who made their Sundance entrée with what they called their “$3 movie” and cast their parents in the follow-up.

But if that foreordained result  in this case an Italian wedding at the end to echo the one where Nick and Beth met cute at the beginning  is going to be satisfying, there need to be obstacles along the way.

So I went to my local library, in Brighton, Mass., asked for “Catcher,” and was told that I would need a note of permission from my parents. The librarian glared at me as she said this. My mother, who was not a big reader herself, wrote a note saying I should be allowed to read whatever I wanted, which now seems one of her greatest gifts to me. That little piece of paper got me into the other, grownup side of the library, where I found a lot of books that opened my eyes and, I suppose, led me eventually to become a writer myself. I have since read better books than “Catcher” but few that made a more lasting impression.

2010-01-29,Inside the List," I AM PATTI: “Just Kids,” the new memoir by Patti Smith, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 7 — not bad for a singer who had precisely one hit single, “Because the Night,” which reached No. 13 on the pop charts in 1978. It may also be a rare moment of punk poetic justice in a book market that tends to be friendlier to the likes of Tori Spelling and Kathy Griffin than to defiantly un-Botoxed middle-aged rockers. And then there’s poor Ozzy Osbourne, marooned at No. 26 on the extended list with “I Am Ozzy.” In an epilogue called “Patient Notes,” the now drug-free sexagenarian confesses he’d still like to have a No. 1 album in America but is realistic about what will be on his headstone: “I ain’t under any illusions. If I close my eyes, I can already see it: ‘Ozzy Osbourne, born, 1948. Died, whenever. He bit the head off a bat.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/books/review/InsideList-t.html

When she confronted her partner, Jacques Henric, on the phone with her discovery of the two women, he generously promised, when he returned from a trip, to “tell me all about the affairs he had had with five or six women.” Alas, the hollandaise has already thickened.

2010-01-29,Après le Déluge,"Paris may be known as the City of Light, but “the City of Water” would be just as apt. Since its origins as an island outpost in the middle of the Seine, the city owes some of its greatest advantages — its trading routes, military security and fertile farmland — to its riverside position. That placement has also, however, long made Paris vulnerable to flooding. The city’s Roman name, Lutetia, is said to derive from the Latin word for mud (lutum), and one of its oldest neighborhoods, the Marais, was originally just that: a marsh. In 814, an unnamed author remarked that “when God wants to punish the people of Paris by water, he sends such a flood and overflows the river Seine.” Divine retribution or not, the deluge is an age-old Parisian problem and accounts for its otherwise improbable-sounding motto: Fluctuat nec Mergitur (“She is tossed about by the waves but does not sink”).

2010-01-29,Super Bowl Wager Provokes Art-Museum Trash Talk," It’s not only mayors and inveterate gamblers who place bets on the Super Bowl — art museums do, too. The Times-Picayune reported that the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Indianapolis Museum of Art have placed a friendly wager on the outcome of the big game on Feb. 7: if the New Orleans Saints win, the Indianapolis museum will send “The Fifth Plague of Egypt” — that is, the landscape from its collection painted by J.M.W. Turner in 1800 — to the New Orleans museum, which gets to show it for three months. If the Indianapolis Colts prevail, the New Orleans institution will send the painting “Ideal View of Tivoli,” a 1644 work by Claude Lorrain, to Indianapolis for three months. The Times-Picayune said the bet was instigated by Tyler Green, who writes the Modern Art Notes blog for artsjournal.com, and who helped egg on some tongue-in-cheek trash talk between the museums’ directors. When E. John Bullard, the New Orleans museum director, offered to wager a valuable Renoir, his Indianapolis counterpart, Maxwell Anderson, dismissed it as a “sentimental blancmange”. Mr. Bullard replied: “I am amused that Renoir is too sweet for Indianapolis. Does this mean that those Indiana corn farmers have simpler tastes?”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/super-bowl-wager-provokes-art-museum-trash-talk/

Less divinely, but only slightly, Robert Redford came down from the mountain last night to sit in on a panel with the author Naomi Klein and the director Michael Winterbottom, who together made “The Shock Doctrine,” a documentary about Milton Friedman, the Chicago School of Economics, third-world corporate oppression and how countries like Haiti get that way. Great stuff. And if the connections with American independent cinema seem a bit, shall we say, loose, well that’s all part of the Great Wheel of Life in Park City, Utah.But it’s hardly a big mystery. When people whisper about the “dirty little secret” of Sundance (the jaded will say, “Uh, which one?”), they’re usually talking about something else: that the documentaries are better than the features? (Yawn.) That the festival is as much about stars as anywhere else? (No kidding.) That when a film is introduced by someone who says, “It went through the Sundance lab … but that’s not why it’s here,” you know that’s exactly why it’s here? Old news. How about the fact that the festival’s Volunteer Appreciation Day was celebrated Wednesday with the same enthusiasm that prison inmates would celebrate Corrections Officer Day?

Turner in 1800  to the New Orleans museum, which gets to hang it for three months. If the Indianapolis Colts prevail, the New Orleans institution will send the painting “Ideal View of Tivoli,” a 1644 work by Claude Lorrain, to Indianapolis for three months. The Times-Picayune said the bet was instigated by Tyler Green, who writes the Modern Art Notes blog for artsjournal.com, and who helped egg on some tongue-in-cheek trash talk between the museums’ directors. When E. John Bullard, the New Orleans museum director, offered to wager a valuable Renoir, his Indianapolis counterpart, Maxwell Anderson, dismissed it as a “sentimental blancmange.” Mr. Bullard replied: “I am amused that Renoir is too sweet for Indianapolis.

Unemployment was rising toward 8 percent. There was an energy shortage and high oil prices because of an embargo on petroleum shipments by Arab nations. The federal budget deficit was approaching $50 billion and the national debt $500 billion  big money in those days. As we prepared the speech  the first draft wasn’t even completed until around 3:30 a.m. on the day of the address  Ford asked Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget, if he had any good economic news to include.
