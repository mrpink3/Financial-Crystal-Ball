2015-05-01,North Korean Diplomats Disrupt Human Rights Panel," A United Nations panel on North Korean human rights abuses, organized by the United States delegation at the organization’s New York headquarters, briefly degenerated into shouting and disorder Thursday when three North Korean diplomats disrupted the event to deliver a statement denying any wrongdoing in their country. The diplomats interrupted North Korean defectors who were testifying about the deprivations they said they had endured. The United States ambassador, Samantha Power, threatened to call in United Nations security guards to evict the North Korean diplomats, but they left after about six minutes. Ms. Power said  that the North Korean diplomats had been invited to speak but only after the defectors had spoken, “and unfortunately, as you heard, the delegation chose instead to try to drown out the testimony of these panelists.” She also told the defectors, “It must be chilling for those of you who have been subjected to the terror of the regime to be confronted with bullying and disruption and the kind of behavior that we saw today.” North Korea has become increasingly angry over actions by the United Nations during the past few years, most notably a human rights report that described much of the country as a large penal colony and called for possible prosecution of North Korean leaders at the International Criminal Court. The United Nations Security Council has tightened sanctions against North Korea because of its nuclear weapons and missile tests. The North Korean authorities have accused the United States of orchestrating such actions as part of what they call an American plot to destabilize their country.

The cast includes Zoe Saldana as Gamora, a green, mean killing machine; Dave Bautista as the brute Drax; Glenn Close as a space-age Hillary Rodham Clinton; Bradley Cooper as the voice of the raccoon Rocket; and Vin Diesel as a gorgeous tree called Groot, who nibbles his own tender sprouts. Oh, yes — and a blue orb that has incited the mayhem in the first place. “That there’s a palpable directorial sensibility in ‘Guardians of the Galaxy,’ along with other signs of genuine life, helps separate this latest Marvel cash grab from a lot of off-the-rack movie cartoons,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats.” She added: “The story may be confusing and generic by turns, but if you shake off the bonds of narrative coherency it’s liberating letting the weird words — Yondu, Necrocraft, Sakkaran — just slide right past you, much like the zigzagging, exploding 3-D spaceships.

2015-05-01,Inside the List,"Marlon and Me: With her Nobel Prize and her graven prose and a leonine profile as stately and imposing as anything on Mount Rushmore, Toni Morrison can come across as frankly a bit intimidating — the woman has authority. Add to that her four-decade career writing brilliant and often despairing novels about the black experience in America, and it’s no wonder interviewers frequently want her to proclaim about race relations or the latest tragedy playing out on the nation’s television screens. Morrison — whose new novel, “God Help the Child,” hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 5 — sometimes obliges them. “People keep saying, ‘We need to have a conversation about race,’ ” she told The Telegraph last month. “This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a black woman. Then when you ask me, ‘Is it over?,’ I will say yes.” (Almost 20 years ago, I heard Morrison read from an early draft of her novel “Paradise,” and when an audience member asked if the gains of the civil rights movement might herald an imminent end to racism, Morrison paused and slowly shook her head. “I am not optimistic,” she said.) But there is a less foreboding, more playful side to Morrison as well: The critic John Leonard once reported that she liked to chat with Fran Lebowitz about Court TV, and she told The Telegraph that Marlon Brando used to call just to recite her work: “I still have his number in my iPhone! How could I erase that?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Our friends Kyle Creane and Gaines Peyton came for the weekend with their kids. We pretended we were camping and cooked over the bonfire and lazed around in hammocks.” And then, for the Miss Dior exhibition that opened yesterday at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Young flew to Beijing with her friend Natalie Portman, the face of Miss Dior. “We went to Shanghai last year — it’s really interesting to see the differences and similarities between the two cities,” Young says. “The Forbidden City is epic, and there are really beautiful parks. The pollution is mind-blowing, though, and I’ve been wearing that mask almost constantly.” She’s also been almost constantly wearing a pair of sunglasses from her spring/summer 2015 collection for Tura, which will be available later this month at shopbop.com ($250 – $350).

When “The Blue Boy” was bought by Henry Huntington for over $700,000 in 1921, it was the most expensive painting ever sold — and its move to California sparked plenty of controversy. In the above video, the Huntington’s chief curator of European art, Catherine Hess, takes T contributing editor David Netto on a private visit to “The Blue Boy” and discusses its unique legacy.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/blue-boy-huntington-library-los-angeles/

2015-05-04,Russia Assails West Over Yemen," In an outburst of diplomatic finger-pointing, Russia on Friday blamed the West for blocking a Security Council statement that sought “humanitarian pauses” in the Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen to allow the delivery of food, fuel and medicine. Emerging from an emergency session of the Council, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, said Yemen was running out of food and medicine and sharply suggested that the United States, which supports the bombings, is responsible for their humanitarian consequences. Russia had proposed a statement that would be unenforceable, and not legally binding. “If you can’t agree to a motherhood and apple pie statement, what can you agree on?” he said. The criticism was in sharp contrast to Russia’s response to efforts by Western countries over the last couple of years to force the Syrian government, which Russia supports, to allow aid convoys into rebel-held areas. In a statement, an American official said Washington supported the idea of a humanitarian pause and was working with its Saudi allies to facilitate the delivery of aid.

2015-05-04,A New Documentary Sheds Light on the ‘Troublemakers’ of Land Art,"Isolation may be the essence of land art, as the director and art historian James Crump says, but if the soaring views of earthworks — straddling canyons; riddled with lightning — in his new documentary are any indication, the genre’s second nature is wonder. Premiering exclusively on T, the trailer for the film “Troublemakers” reveals an intersecting group of artists in the late ’60s and early ’70s, united equally by their communion with the elements and their anti-authoritarian attitudes. Often shirtless and shot in grainy black-and-white footage, some of which has never before been shown, the literal groundbreakers profiled — such as Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria and Robert Smithson — do little to undercut their mythologies as “difficult or headstrong or rebellious,” Crump says. But “troublemaking can also mean instigation or stirring up the waters, and it implies critique,” he adds, noting that land art emerged at the same time Americans were confronting images of bombed-out landscapes from the Vietnam War and of the cratered surface of the moon. “There was an urgency to make the work,” Crump says — even if the artworks, like the open vistas that animated them, defied collecting as “an investable asset class.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/land-art-smithson-holt-heizer-troublemakers-movie/

Ferraro is classically trained, but had to abandon the orchestral route midway through his studies at Berkeley, when severe arthritis began to take its toll on his hands, forcing him to pursue a less technically demanding musical path. Since then, he’s recorded as Astronauts, etc., served as the touring keyboardist for the “chillwave” progenitor Toro Y Moi and, most surprisingly, become heavily involved in the algorithm writing scene. The what? Let him explain. “I serendipitously fell in with this group of hackers,” Ferraro explains. “I learned how to program really quick, and wanted to use it as a composition aid for myself.” He’s since come to look at coding as an art form, and hopes others, including forward-thinking collectors, will follow suit: in March, his work “Hypothetical Beats” was included at the world’s first algorithm auction at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

He also said the United States had allocated $5 million for the creation of a special court or other independent judicial mechanism that would hold perpetrators of atrocities and other crimes in South Sudan to account. Speaking at a news conference while visiting Nairobi, Kenya, Mr. Kerry said South Sudan’s promising potential after achieving independence from Sudan in 2011 “is now at grave risk of being squandered because of civil violence, because of more than two million people who have been displaced from their homes.” He sharply criticized President Salva Kiir of South Sudan and his political rival, the former vice president, Riek Machar, “who have not yet chosen to make the compromises needed for peace.” In an interview with South Sudan’s Eye Radio, Mr. Kerry was even more blunt, saying South Sudan’s leaders “need to come to their senses” and make peace. Loyalists of Mr. Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, and Mr. Machar, of the Nuer ethnic group, have been fighting since December 2013.

Corrigan and Jake Sargent, the other creative director at Simon Miller, “loved the music scene and bar culture in Austin,” he says. “It’s like nowhere else, always something going on.” In the above slide show, the duo share snapshots of their adventures in Texas’s capital, where they sipped margaritas, shopped for vintage treasures and cacti, went for a swim (or two) and just couldn’t get enough brunch.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/austin-travel-diary-simon-miller/

When she arrives, half an hour late, she is visibly intoxicated and reeks of alcohol. I immediately fire her after getting a verbal admission that she was drinking. I later found out that the nanny was previously fired by another family for being drunk on the job. The nanny lives with her 10-year-old son in my neighborhood, where many people use a local email list to seek out nannies. I know that she responds to these email ads, and I have just found out that she currently has another job with a family, but I don’t know who the family is or how to contact them. My husband does not want me to post anything on our local email list, for fear of retribution. I am losing sleep that this woman is still taking care of children, and I am also worried about her son’s safety.

We were all strangely unsettled by these messages from beyond the grave, by my grandmother’s sudden appearance in our inboxes so soon after we’d lost her.

2015-05-06,At Home by the Sea,"This little tale of a Vietnamese family begins in a simple way. “In a fishing village by the sea there is a small house,” the first double-page spread reads. To the left, a fisherman stands in his boat, looking up at the house, which sits high on a cliff. We can’t see his face, but his posture and upturned glance suggest wistfulness. Around him other fishermen ply the waters in their own small boats. If you look closely, you can see a white-yellow dog making its way up the steep, winding path to the house. April Chu’s serene, intensely detailed artwork offers a lovely and fully realized scene, and invites us into an equally well-calibrated story by the Vietnamese-born Muon Van. Together, they’ve made a picture book that’s somehow both modest and captivating.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/books/review/at-home-by-the-sea.html

Raised on a diet of Michael Jackson videos and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, Rubchinskiy says his early designs were costumes modeled after those worn by the flamboyant Freddie Mercury. Underground magazines later turned him on to the music and rave scenes of the generation born after the collapse of the Soviet Union; skateboarder culture in particular became an obsession and an inspiration. Rubchinskiy has since moved beyond streetwear — and into Dover Street Market — but his work still smacks of youthful irreverence: His latest collection included sweatshirts with the word “sport” printed in Cyrillic and Chinese, and pants, loose, acid-washed and cinched at the waist with shoelaces.

2015-05-06,1915: Premier Tells of Allies Landing,"LONDON — In the House of Commons this evening [May 6], Mr. Asquith gave details of the landing of the Allied forces in the Dardanelles. The disembarkation, he said, commenced at daybreak on April 25, in face of great opposition from entrenched infantry and artillery, and by nightfall 29,000 men had landed. The British and Indian troops disembarked at Seddul Bahr. The Indians were held up during the whole day, but eventually succeeded by a fine attack in taking up their positions, enabling them to cover the landing of the remainder of the forces. The disembarkation of the Australians and New Zealanders at Gaba Tepe was opposed by heavy fire at point- blank range, but with a rush they carried the position and pushing forward the attack with the greatest dash. The French forces which landed at Hum Kalessi, on the Asiatic shore, advanced with great gallantry. — The New York Herald, European edition, May 7, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/1915-premier-tells-of-allies-landing/

In the right role, like Captain Vere in Britten’s “Billy Budd,” he can sing with penetrating intensity. And he’s a riveting actor. Still, his is an intimate tenor voice, ideally suited to the Evangelist in Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion,” and, as this new recording again demonstrates, the lieder repertory. Joined by the vibrant fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout, Mr. Padmore sings songs by Haydn, Mozart’s seldom-heard “Masonic Cantata,” and a diverse selection of Beethoven songs, including the composer’s only cycle, the great “An die ferne Geliebte.” This is eloquent lieder singing driven by astute and sensitive attention to the texts.

This is why a lot of these philosophers didn’t really have a place for art — they saw it as a distraction,” says Zelehoski in his self-built studio in Beacon, New York, where he’s been working since a fateful trip to Dia, the minimalist Mecca, back in 2011. For his upcoming exhibit, Zelehoski has transformed found objects, mostly discarded wooden stockroom palettes and police barricades, into intricately cut 2D, wall-mounted assemblages. The works function as optical illusions that seek to alter our relationship not only to physical space but to the often overlooked, humble, utilitarian objects that move within it.

And in our ecologically strained times, trees are also urgent reminders of what a mess we’ve gotten ourselves into — plus a symbol of hope for greener days ahead. Arboreal uprooting is by no means a rarity in the contemporary art world, and it seems to have reached a critical mass at this year’s Venice Biennale, opening to the public May 9, where three of the most prominent pavilions in the Giardini are tree-centric.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/dead-tree-venice-biennale/

Currently on display at Danziger Gallery, the photo collages emerged from his paintings of nudes that he deemed not up to par. “I had a lot in storage and I thought, ‘What do I do with these?'” he says. “So, I started to add abstractions, like ‘little Calders,’ and each turned out to be a better painting” — and to play with censorship, plenty of which Perez has encountered on Instagram. (“You have no idea how many posts of mine have been taken down because they don’t meet the community standards,” he says.) He then decided to pull pictures of women from their social media accounts and apply the same principle, both an organic extension of his practice and a response to the age of digital sharing. “And,” Perez continues, “I like covering certain parts because people’s imaginations complete the job.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/enoc-perez-inge-morath-danziger-gallery/

As the ringleader of a crew of dirty cops stationed at the 75th Precinct in East New York, he padded his income by stealing money, guns and drugs from dealers. He eventually graduated to working for drug rings, one of which put him on retainer so he could provide information about narcotic operations. “The Seven Five” has been called “the cop version of ‘GoodFellas,’ ” which may explain why Sony has plans to produce a fictional remake. Here’s hoping that version uses a better moral compass. ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/movies/review-the-seven-five-a-documentary-about-a-corrupt-new-york-cop.html

None were quite as peculiar as the work undertaken by the researchers in “Kitchen Stories,” who perched in lifeguard chairs in middle-class kitchens in the 1950s to observe the habits of housewives.

In these familiar ceremonial interactions, the bros lean in toward each other for some upper-body contact even as they simultaneously maintain scrupulous, observable genital distance. Once contact is made, the bro-huggers exchange two or three hearty back slaps and then uncouple. In the comedy “The D Train,” there’s no such retreat — only sweet, sweaty surrender.

2015-05-08,India: Border Dispute With Bangladesh Nears an End," Parliament unanimously passed a bill on Thursday for a constitutional amendment that paves the way for a resolution of a decades-old boundary dispute with Bangladesh by exchanging pockets of land near the border and ultimately allowing thousands of people to choose their citizenship. More than 160 enclaves exist in either India or Bangladesh near the border that are encircled by the other nation’s territory. The situation is rooted in centuries-old peace treaties and the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India called the passage of the bill “a historic milestone,” and Bangladesh’s envoy to India, Syed Muazzem Ali, called it a “historic and landmark day.” The bill must be passed by at least half the state legislatures before the boundary agreement can be put into effect.

According to the prosecutor’s statement, the United Nations report contains testimony by six children aged 9 to 13. Four of them said they had been abused by French soldiers and two others said they had witnessed the abuse, which is said to have occurred at a camp at the M’poko airport, in the capital, Bangui, between December 2013 and last June. The airport was guarded by French troops who were sent to the Central African Republic in 2013 to quell a sectarian conflict.

This biopic about Dido Elizabeth Belle (1761-1804), directed by Amma Asante and written by Misan Sagay, chronicles the difficult love life of Belle, an educated beauty — including a dashing suitor, John Davinier (Sam Reid), as well as several not-so-charming ones. The movie also covers Belle’s uncle, the Lord Chief Justice, who must decide on a case involving a slave ship on which more than 130 Africans were massacred for an insurance payment. “The movie plays with the historical record for dramatic effect, as is often the case when the past is disinterred for entertainment, and its realism at times groans under the weight of too many passionate speeches,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Yet the weave of the personal and the political finally proves as irresistible as it is moving, partly because it has been drawn from extraordinary life.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

She had made headlines five years earlier with “The Lottery,” which attracted attention not only for its shocking content, but also for the vehemence of the response it provoked. Many were unsure whether this tale of ritual stoning in an American village was fact or fiction; some railed at The New Yorker for printing such barbarism; others just wanted to know what on earth it meant. Jackson, who had already published the novel “The Road Through the Wall” (1948), about murder and suicide in a small California town, sealed her macabre reputation with her next two books: “The Lottery” (1949), a collection of often suspenseful short stories, and “Hangsaman” (1951), a coming-of-age novel about a college student who suffers a mental breakdown.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/books/review/shirley-jacksons-life-among-the-savages-and-raising-demons-reissued.html

One morning last week, on the second-to-last day of the month of Strawberry Rhubarb and Thyme — otherwise known as April; the flavor changes every month — a man named Thao stood at the front of the neatly assembled crowd.

Phillips was born on the island of St. Kitts in 1958, but as an infant he left with his parents during the mass migration of people from the Caribbean islands — still colonial subjects ­­— to Britain in the 1950s. Immigration has been a key topic in Phillips’s work from his very first novel, “The Final Passage” (1985). His first two novels were fairly straightforward in style and structure, but with his third, “Higher Ground” (1989), Phillips introduced the more ambitious and unconventional approach he has used ever since. Rather than tell one linear story, these later novels bring together several independent narratives set at different places on the globe and at different moments in time.

This installment takes the characters from 1953 through 1986, introducing a new generation and letting them contend with milestones like the Vietnam War, Jim Jones’s seductive Peoples Temple and the early days of the AIDS crisis. In some hands the conceit could have felt gimmicky or forced, a kissing cousin to “Forrest Gump” or Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” But reviewers so far have been largely impressed, comparing Smiley to the giants of 19th-century literature. (“America’s Tolstoy,” ruled Christobel Kent in The Guardian.) Smiley also keeps an eye on her forebears, if more humbly. “Trollope would sneer,” she told one interviewer last year, after announcing she was about done with the trilogy’s 1,300 pages. In the same profile, she remembered with approval the motivational note — “Nobody asked you to write this novel” — that a former classmate kept taped to her typewriter. “What we do as writers is voluntary, so don’t complain,” Smiley said, recalling how inspired she was by an exhibit of hand-­corrected page proofs at the Balzac museum in Paris. “It’s good to see what it meant to be a popular author in the middle of the 19th century,” she said. “When you see how hard Balzac worked, you’ll never complain again.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario; and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he’s crushing grapes for homemade wine. “Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this “mostly funny comedy” from David Wain. “Like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There’s something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn’t let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It has been her fate, unfortunately, to make her furious, uninspiring way through a series of plodding and ungainly stories.” And “despite the slick intensity of Mr. Fincher’s style, his movie is not immune to the same lumbering proceduralism,” Mr. Scott said.

This year, Moore faced the task of topping last spring’s contemporary dinner, for which Sotheby’s flew in 16 chefs from Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant often cited as the best in the world, and asked them to recreate its dining experience right in Sotheby’s New York flagship on the Upper East Side.

2015-05-11,What’s On TV Monday,"11:30 A.M. (Showtime) FRUITVALE STATION (2013) On Jan. 1, 2009, Oscar Grant III, a 22-year-old black father, was shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer on a subway platform in Oakland, Calif., his killing captured on cellphone. Ryan Coogler’s feature directorial debut reconstructs the final 24 hours in the life of Mr. Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan, above with Ariana Neal) who, after two stints in prison, had returned to selling drugs after losing his job at a supermarket because of chronic lateness. Octavia Spencer plays his mother and Melonie Diaz the mother of his daughter, with whom he’s trying to stay. Mr. Coogler’s “main intention — and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan’s — is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The radicalism of ‘Fruitvale Station’ lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that ‘Fruitvale Station’ at once exposes and resists.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

Uber and other start-ups have been raising money at a pace that is unprecedented in Silicon Valley, “driven by money pouring in from hedge funds, strategic investors and more, and by the willingness of entrepreneurs to embrace the cash,” Mike Isaac and Michael J. de la Merced write in The New York Times. Mark Suster, a partner at the venture capital firm Upfront Ventures, said there’s only one reason these companies are raising money so quickly: Because they can. “When capital markets are this loose, people tap them, whether it’s right to or not,” he said.

In this version of things, the case histories that constituted most of medical literature up to the early 20th century reflect a lack of empirical sophistication. Only if we can’t compute something are we reduced to storytelling, which is inherently subjective and often inaccurate.

Now, Satloff has commissioned a series of photographs by Horacio Salinas, debuting exclusively here, that capture her designs in their historical and artistic context. The images, styled by the creative director and former jewelry editor Talya Cousins, take as their point of departure an antique book of bird illustrations printed in 1873; they feel, Satloff says, “almost as if a bird had flown in and collected the jewelry.” Modern-day magpies can do the same through Larkspur & Hawk’s new website and online store, which relaunches today.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/larkspur-and-hawk-jewels-take-flight/

2015-05-12,Iran: Blacklisted Airline Buys Planes," An Iranian airline blacklisted under United States sanctions has bought nine used Airbus passenger planes, in a move that could further complicate the multilateral talks aimed at resolving Iran’s disputed nuclear program by the end of next month. The Iranian news media reported Sunday that the airline, Mahan Air, bought the aircraft — eight Airbus A340s and one A321 — for an undisclosed amount from unidentified sellers, and that they were placed into service last week. The Iranian news accounts described the purchase as an important boost for the country’s civilian aviation industry, which has struggled for many years because of an aging fleet and American-imposed restrictions on access to replacement aircraft, parts, technology and service. Mahan Air was placed on a sanctions list in October 2011 by the Treasury Department over what it called the airline’s support for activities of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and Hezbollah militants. The purchase could inflame congressional critics of the nuclear talks who contend that Iran cannot be trusted and that it already is openly flouting the sanctions.

Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. “As a satire, ‘The Player’ tickles,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “It doesn’t draw blood.” Mr. Altman’s most subversive message, he added, “is not that it’s possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

In 2012, Maryland, Maine and Washington became the first states to ratify same-sex marriage by popular vote.

Created by the French-born, New York-based designer James Taffin de Givenchy — nephew of the fashion legend Hubert and a master at reinterpreting rare and antique stones through highly original silhouettes — the piece was designed to resemble an abstract exclamation point. Two Victorian-era pink topazes of slightly different hues — one a 3.5-carat pear-shaped stone, the other a 39-carat oval-cut with mauve undertones — are cradled by 105 diamonds. A pair of craftsmen at the Taffin atelier spent 60 hours hand-mounting the gems into their setting, and the piece’s eventual owner will receive a fitting so that the necklace alights on the collarbone just so — an enviable punctuation mark if ever there was one.

2015-05-13,A Ballet to Open Versailles’s New Water Theater Grove,"This week, the Château de Versailles inaugurated its newly renovated Water Theater grove with an original 10-minute performance by the new Paris Opera Ballet director Benjamin Millepied’s L.A. Dance Project. “It’s the first ballet in the grove since the time of Louis XIV,” said the artist Jean-Michel Othoniel, whose idea it was to include the company in the celebrations. The four-year project, led by the celebrated French landscape architect Louis Benech, reimagined André Le Nôtre’s long-neglected 18th-century hedged secret garden and outdoor theater as something far edgier, with angular, rusted steel-framed pools and Othoniel’s swirling gold-bead fountains based on the Baroque choreographer Raoul-Auger Feuillet’s shorthand notations of period dances. “It seems absolutely natural that this bosquet as it is now is here,” mused the Versailles president Catherine Pégard, as she sat in the shade of one of the new Japanese angelica trees and proudly took it all in. “It’s a totally contemporary work that is perfectly integrated into the park’s history.

The limited prohibition is comparable to rules in many European countries, but critics said it did not take into account modern diagnostic tools that can detect H.I.V. infection as early as nine to 11 days after exposure. The contested part of the proposal remains unchanged in Tuesday’s version, which details the policy and is open to public comment for 60 days before a final decision. In a nod to transgender Americans, the proposal allows donors to report their gender; under current policy, eligibility is determined strictly based on a donor’s sex at birth.

The move could mean higher borrowing costs for Chicago, which is wrestling with an underfunded pension system of its own. The State Supreme Court opinion, issued last week, barred the state from lowering pension benefits for public employees under a provision of the Illinois Constitution, but it also raised doubts about the legality of changes Chicago has made to two of its pension funds. Mayor Rahm Emanuel criticized Moody’s downgrade as premature. “While Chicago’s financial crisis is very real and at our doorsteps, today’s irresponsible decision by Moody’s to downgrade the city’s credit by two steps goes far beyond that reality,” Mr. Emanuel said.

2015-05-13,What’s On TV Wednesday,"1:20 A.M. (Starz) BLUE JASMINE (2013) Cate Blanchett, above with Peter Sarsgaard, won an Oscar for her role as Jasmine French, a Park Avenue matron fallen on hard times after her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), lands in prison for bilking his clients, leaving her with little more than her pearls, Chanel jacket, Hermès bag and Louis Vuitton luggage. Destitute, in a manner of speaking, Jasmine flies first-class to San Francisco to begin life anew with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), whose scrappy existence and brutish men Jasmine can barely stomach without self-medicating with vodka and Xanax. Then she meets a diplomatic type (Mr. Sarsgaard) with an appreciation for her decorating talents and designer threads and starts to see light at the end of her dark tunnel. With intimations of Ruth Madoff and Blanche DuBois, this shattered woman is “brilliantly brought to quivering life by Ms. Blanchett,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, in Woody Allen’s “most sustained, satisfying and resonant film since ‘Match Point.’ ”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Studying the trend he’d seen in the previous few years, Moore predicted that every year we’d double the number of transistors that could fit on a single chip of silicon so you’d get twice as much computing power for only slightly more money. When that came true, in 1975, he modified his prediction to a doubling roughly every two years. “Moore’s Law” has essentially held up ever since — and, despite the skeptics, keeps chugging along, making it probably the most remarkable example ever of sustained exponential growth of a technology.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/thomas-friedman-moores-law-turns-50.html

And finally they began to kill themselves. Among the scores of Germans who committed suicide in Nazi Germany’s final hours were Dr. ­Joseph Goebbels, minister of propaganda and, since July 1944, “Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War,” and his wife, Magda.

Meanwhile identification with every major branch of Christianity is down in percentage terms, and only evangelical Christianity is seeing its absolute numbers still increase; the black Protestant churches are holding steady, but in Pew’s numbers Catholicism seems to have joined the Protestant Mainline in a kind of demographic freefall.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/the-real-but-overstated-decline-of-american-christianity/

This Thursday at Ryan Lee Gallery, the noble and light-footed nephew of the late Helen Frankenthaler will showcase two series of silver gelatin photographs from the late ’90s in “The Abstract Edge,” beginning with his “Grain Series,” perhaps the most abstract and spare photographic works in Ross’ expansive but underappreciated catalogue. Evoking the minimal but potent energy of an Ad Reinhardt painting, the photographs display tone and emulsion only, embodying the pure essence of a tumultuous swell while simultaneously dissembling the photographic process. The second and “edgier” half, the “Wave Series,” presents only the whisper of a wave crest and is deeply indebted to Richard Serra. “My aunt created a masterpiece at age 23. I’m on the flip side of that,” says a relaxed Ross in his West Village studio. “She had to live down staggering success. For me, it was a gradual climb to things that were better or more meaningful.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/clifford-ross-ryan-lee-mass-moca/

He became president in 1982, receiving weapons and funds from the United States, which sought a counterweight to neighboring Libya.

Women with their children being held in three family detention centers will have a first review after 90 days and then every two months after that. The immigration authorities will no longer point to a general goal of deterring illegal border crossing as the reason for detaining women and children. But the authorities will continue to place a high priority on deporting or detaining migrants caught crossing the border illegally. Central American women seeking asylum and their children have faced many months in detention while their cases moved through the immigration courts. “The new policy is designed to continually re-evaluate whether detention is necessary” for them, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said.

The Justice Department announced in March that it would no longer pursue such seizures, a form of civil asset forfeiture based on a pattern of small cash deposits, without a criminal charge or evidence of criminal activity. The prosecutor in Mr. McLellan’s case had expressed displeasure that Congress had been given sealed court filings and offered him a settlement of half his money. Last week, the Justice Department said it would investigate two other prosecutors after one business owner whose assets were seized said he had been punished more harshly after publicizing his case and another said he had been threatened with a felony charge if he did not agree to give up some of his money. This is the third high-profile case that prosecutors have dropped in recent months. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/us/north-carolina-more-seized-assets-to-be-returned.html

To that end, the top floor of Eek’s vast studio and workshop in Eindhoven (a former Philips lighting factory that also encompasses a restaurant and store) has been christened the Wonder Room and exhibits collaborations, most of them among emerging Dutch talent, that blur the lines between design, fine art and technological innovation. Now, to coincide with New York Design Week (and change), Eek is commandeering the entire Future Perfect storefront in NoHo to create a Stateside iteration of that space. On view and available for purchase are a number of new pieces created in collaboration with some of Eek’s favorite young compatriots — such as a hardware-out “exoskeleton cabinet” by Paul Heijnen and artwork by Marc Mulders — as well as never-before-seen works by Eek himself, including a brass mesh lamp and a burned-and-oxidized steel cabinet. Eek also brought American designers into his Wonder Room mix for the first time via a lighting showcase, featuring such local mainstays as Lindsey Adelman, Bec Brittain and Jason Miller.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/t-magazine/piet-hein-eek-furniture-wonder-room.html

2015-05-14,What’s on TV Thursday,"9:40 A.M. (TMC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

2015-05-14,Review: Alex Katz at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise,"Among the more moving art experiences is seeing a painter excel late in life. Alex Katz, 87, is well known for landscapes and portraits that combine direct perception; wet-on-wet speed-painting and scale; and a distinct merging of Pop Art, abstraction and the plein-air tradition. But now he is having one of the best gallery exhibitions of his career, a display of landscape paintings — lately his surest work — that while seeming to modulate his familiar style have a new, more emotional resonance.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/arts/design/review-alex-katz-at-gavin-browns-enterprise.html

Armed men were seen confiscating bundles of khat, burning them in bonfires and inspecting the markets for violators. At least five trucks loaded with khat were reported to have been stopped from entering Al Mukalla. The militant group, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was able to exploit the chaos caused by airstrikes by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels to occupy Al Mukalla on April 16. The Houthis, who have received support from Iran, occupied the capital and ousted the president in recent months.

2015-05-15,What’s on TV Friday,"11:45 P.M. (Starz Cinema) FOR NO GOOD REASON (2014) “I really thought what I would do, if I ever learned to draw properly, was I would try to change the world,” the British artist Ralph Steadman explains in Charlie Paul’s documentary about him. So in 1970, Mr. Steadman jetted to New York, where he planned to take a thousand photographs that would inspire the illustrations he couldn’t seem to get quite right. “There was an arrogance missing, there was a wildness missing, there was a rawness missing,” he says of that early work. “It lacked that bite I needed, that real ferocious bite, the thing that would make it noticeable.” Then he received instructions to meet Hunter S. Thompson, not long after his infiltration of the Hells Angels. The weekend became a vicious, drunken nightmare, and he and Thompson went to pieces. Thus, gonzo journalism — in which the writer (and in this decadent collaboration, the illustrator) becomes the story — was born. What would Thompson’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” be without Mr. Steadman’s ink-speckled and splotched drawings, Mr. Steadman argues. “There is a formal discipline and thematic coherence to Mr. Steadman’s images that his friend’s writing sometimes lacked,” A. O.

2015-05-15,Haruki Murakami’s ‘Strange Library’ and ‘Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage’,"What’s so beguiling about Haruki Murakami? It’s a question asked by admirers and detractors alike. As with few other authors, the charms of Murakami’s books are difficult to pin down, so completely and gracefully does his work slip past the usual benchmarks of enjoyable literature. His plots are full of interesting incidents, but they build slowly, or not at all, or in a way that’s completely off kilter, rather than following any real discernible arc. Regular readers of Murakami will find him reusing his favorite devices — cats, missing girls, obscure works of music — making them less startling and/or more enduring, depending on one’s point of view. Structurally, his work appears to proceed by instinct rather than by strategy; his use of the third person in “1Q84,” for instance, feels exactly like his vast, samey array of first-person narrators. Murakami’s work brushes up against some grand themes but doesn’t quite tackle them; his best novel, “The Wind‑Up Bird Chronicle,” explores the horrors of World War II, but nobody would describe the book as making a major statement about war. As for his language — well, most of us New York Times readers are receiving Murakami in translation, but even so there’s little to indicate we’re missing some grand linguistics in the original. His language is accessible, plain-spoken, even banal, perhaps purposefully so.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/books/review/haruki-murakamis-strange-library-and-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage.html

2015-05-15,Toward an Oral Art,"“I love it when you read to me,” Stephin Merritt croons in “The Book of Love,” that mainstay of moderately alternative bride-and-groom dances. He’s not alone. At some point, almost everyone likes to be read to — at weddings and funerals, where we expect to hear a little tasteful verse; at religious services, where we want to hear a few passages from Scripture; and at bedtime, where we (assuming “we” are preschoolers) would like to hear about Thing One and Thing Two. But until relatively recently, the car and the kitchen weren’t standard venues for listening to a story, poem or novel. That has changed with the well-documented rise of the audiobook, a format in which, as The New York Times has previously noted, publishers “released nearly 36,000 titles in 2013, up from 6,200 in 2010, according to the Audio Publishers Association.” The Wall Street Journal calls audiobooks a “rare bright spot” in the publishing industry, and pins the total market for them at well over a billion dollars.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/books/review/toward-an-oral-art.html

We move between two strands — one the unnamed badger baiter known as “the big man” and the other, Daniel, a Welsh farmer grieving for his recently dead wife and trying to keep her memory alive as well as their lambs.

Call him Telemachus, call him Stephen Dedalus. Or call him Ananda Sen, who in 1985 is studying English literature in Britain’s capital and making a bad thing of it. He wants to be a poet, he likes Ted Hughes and Philip Larkin, and he has begun to learn that Shakespeare’s language isn’t so much universal as rooted in English particulars.

2015-05-15,A New Dance by Rebecca Patek at Chocolate Factory,"The title of Rebecca Patek’s new performance piece is a mouthful: “The Future Was Looking Better in the Past: My Family Herstory: or from religious persecution to american greed to murderous infamy to denial, repression and the slow dissolution into moral confusion, financial ruin and karmic retribution.” In the work, Ms. Patek, a choreographer and performance artist who often confronts disturbing subject matter — her last show involved rape — explores facets of violence, both buried within herself and out in the world. In her premiere, presented by the Chocolate Factory and Abrons Arts Center, she finds inspiration in the vicious 1924 murder of Bobby Franks by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. Performed by John Hoobyar, Sam Roeck and Chris Tyler, the work blends material from the murder trial, Patek’s family history and her own imagination: Who were Leopold and Loeb? What were their psychological complexities? What leads to acts of horror? For Ms. Patek, armed with a wry, twisted sense of humor, the answers float somewhere in the subconscious.

You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral,” Leonard Bernstein said about Berlioz’s colorfully macabre “Symphonie Fantastique,” a musical hallucinogenic that evokes an opium-using, heartbroken artist. There is also plenty of emotional tumult in Brahms’s Piano Concerto No. 1, which James Levine will conduct on the same program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall. The pianist Yefim Bronfman — a consummate Brahms performer who combines burly firepower and elegance — will no doubt bring out the wild side of this fiery work with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra as superb partners.

2015-05-15,Inside the List,"Dead in the Water: “Deal,” Bill Kreutzmann’s memoir of his decades playing drums for the Grateful Dead, is new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. The book (written with Benjy Eisen) opens with an anecdote from the late 1980s, when the band finally broke through to mainstream success: Its only Top 40 hit, “Touch of Grey,” reached No. 9 on the Billboard chart; the video was in constant rotation on MTV; and the band sold out a five-night run at Madison Square Garden. The attention, Kreutzmann acknowledges, was a little overwhelming. “We decided to celebrate by getting as far away from it all as possible,” he writes, explaining how he and Jerry Garcia, the singer and lead guitarist, ended up scuba diving in Hawaii one day with their roadie Steve Parish. “It was as psychedelic and far-out as anything we had seen during the Acid Tests, or at Woodstock, or during our strange days wandering around San Francisco during the Summer of Love. And yet, we were sober for this one. After years of persistent pot smoking, psychedelic excesses, alcohol benders, cocaine binges and heroin abuse, scuba diving was going to be our new drug.” It was, eventually — Kreutzmann and Garcia dived together many times over the years, as the rest of the book makes clear. But that first trip didn’t take them as far from fame as they had hoped: Underwater, a scuba instructor swam up to Garcia with a waterproof notepad and asked for his autograph. “Twenty feet below the surface!” Kreutzmann writes. “I nearly spat out my regulator from laughing so hard.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Yet the stories in Millhauser’s spellbinding collection “Voices in the Night” are anchored by dark human yearnings — for perfection, or excitement, or some ungraspable form of fulfillment.

He plays with the materials that make a dance possible — the floors, the walls and, now, the curtains. Part of his practice involves the installation and dismantling of objects. Over the course of three nights of performances at Danspace Project recently, it was a portable stage used by New York City Ballet; at the Whitney Museum of American Art last spring, it was a piece of a wall.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/arts/dance/review-yve-laris-cohens-fine-dissects-the-nature-of-performance-spaces.html

The answer to this question is irreducibly clear: on marsala-colored cloaks! Is it a Pantone conspiracy that the design authority’s official color of the year has been tracked not once but three times on Randall’s Island — in cape form? At the booth of the Bogotá gallery Instituto de visión, a scroll of wine-colored fabric terminating in a poncho is emblazoned with the words “PIA FOR SALE,” advertising a performative action by the Mexican artist Pia Camil. Meanwhile, a not dissimilar garment has been committed to canvas by the Brazilian artist Edoardo Berliner at the booth held by the São Paulo gallery Casa Triângulo. Titled “Sapatos” (“Shoes”), the headless, matadoresque draping calls attention to the glossy black footwear beneath it. Perhaps the most striking of maroon gowns on display, however, is the chromed sculpture at Parisian dealer Jocelyn Wolff’s stand. As part of an elegant solo presentation by the French artist Guillame Leblon, this merlot mantle without a wearer is an homage to Giacometti that triggers a theme consistent throughout Leblon’s work, the spectral absence of the body.

2015-05-18,Inside T’s Travel Issue,"T’s latest issue explores some of the most unique travel destinations around the world. We begin with an anomaly: an ancient farming community in northwest India where locals and leopards have lived in peaceful harmony for hundreds of years. The novelist Hari Kunzru sets up camp to experience the potentially precarious phenomenon firsthand. In Joshua Tree, we visit a far-out house, designed by the visionary architect Kendrick Bangs Kellogg, that is nearly as awe-inspiring as the landscape itself. We also stop by one of the world’s great inns — La Colombe d’Or in Provence — where a century’s worth of famous artists toting their own works have helped create an environment that is as much a world-class gallery as it is a hotel. And because summer is coming, we sent the photographer Karim Sadli to Hawaii, where he shot the model Julia Bergshoeff in the season’s best bikini bottoms and lightweight knits. Elsewhere, female artists in their 80s and 90s get their long-awaited due; the finance journalist Felix Salmon shines a light on conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the parties are usurping the panels for all-important networking (and Spring Break-style fun); Jody Rosen cracks the spine on street lit, the hard-boiled, sexed-up book genre whose greatest practitioners may just be the most successful literary couple in America; and tattoos, which have grown increasingly idiosyncratic in recent years, leave their mark on the minds (and bodies) of the creative world’s most stylish.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that Poland had violated the rights of the two inmates by permitting the C.I.A. to imprison them in 2002 at a facility in northeast Poland. The secret prison is now closed. “We will abide by the ruling, as we always do,” said Marcin Wojciechowski, the chief spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In February, Mr. Wojciechowski said the authorities had come up with a plan to put the money into accounts that the suspects could gain access to only after they had been released. The two men — Abu Zubaydah, a high-ranking Al Qaeda official, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was accused of planning the attack in 2000 on the American destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden — are being held in the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

2015-05-18,1915: New Portuguese Premier Shot On Reaching Lisbon,"LONDON — Just when peace and calm had apparently been restored in Portugal, a grave event has occurred that will probably  have a disastrous effect on the situation. A telegram from Lisbon received this evening [May 17] states that Senhor Chagas, the new Prime Minister, was shot at and seriously wounded by Senator João José de Freitas. Senhor Chagas had just arrived at the Entroncamento railway station, coming from Oporto to take possession of  the Premiership. A large gathering was on the platform to meet him, and while shaking hands with and receiving the congratulations of his friends, Senhor Freitas broke through and fired several revolver shots at the new Premier. A struggle ensued and gendarmes fired on the assassin who was killed on the spot. Senhor Chagas was taken to hospital in a dying condition. It is feared, as  a result of this tragedy, that the trouble may recommence. There are already signs of a fresh outbreak. — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 18, 1915Correction: June 4, 2015An article in the “In Our Pages” column on May 18, recalling the shooting of the Portuguese primes minister in 1915, misspelled the name of the senator who shot Senhor Chagas. He was João José de Freitas not Senator Jean Freilas. The error was recently brought to light by a reader.",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/1915-new-portuguese-premier-shot-on-reaching-lisbon/
2015-05-18,1965: Beaujolais? That’s What You Think,"PARIS — One of the nicest red wines France has to offer is Beaujolais, famed for its fresh, fruity flavor. And the chance of getting a genuine bottle — even in Paris — is less than one in five. The French weekly newspaper Candide today [May 17] told of the high odds in an exposé entitled ‘‘The Beaujolais Scandal.’’ It cited the estimate of one expert that, while only 18.5 million gallons of true Beaujolais are produced each year, five times as much is sold under the Beaujolais label in the Paris region alone. Few Frenchmen would challenge the estimate.",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/1965-beaujolais-thats-what-you-think/

So were all-encompassing drones, hip-hop tracks that had been sped up or melted down, thoroughly warped glimmers of pop and the sounds of barking dogs and breaking glass. They’re all part of the label’s amorphous but somehow coherent sensibility, which finds that deterioration and entropy can make pop elements seem more precious or reveal a murky beauty of their own.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/arts/music/an-apt-basement-celebration-of-tri-angle-records.html

2015-05-18,What’s on TV Monday,"4:15 P.M. (Starz Cinema) LOVE IS STRANGE (2014) Alfred Molina and John Lithgow (above right, with Mr. Molina) portray Ben and George, a couple for 39 years who are forced to live apart after their marriage results in the loss of George’s job at a Roman Catholic school and a mortgage they can no longer afford. So Ben moves into the Brooklyn apartment of his nephew (Darren Burrows), his nephew’s wife (Marisa Tomei) and their son (Charlie Tahan). And George takes a spot on the living room couch of his former neighbors (Cheyenne Jackson and Manny Perez), two New York City police officers. Awkwardness ensues. The film’s director, Ira Sachs, “is an especially careful student of the odd rhythms and quiet intensities of couplehood, both gay and straight,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Lithgow and Mr. Molina, seasoned and subtle actors, beautifully capture the small pleasures and petty irritations Ben and George live through, and also their pride at having survived, together, for so long.” Mr. Sachs, he added, “casts an occasional discreet glance backward at the post-Stonewall history of gay men in New York, a complicated chronicle of tragedy, resilience, struggle and fun. But that history nonetheless feels implicit in every frame, infusing what might otherwise be a touching anecdote about real estate troubles and houseguest etiquette with gravity and grace.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-05-18,Morning Agenda: Why Hedge Funds are Closing,"WHY HEDGE FUNDS ARE CLOSING | Increased regulation, volatile markets and heightened investor scrutiny have prompted hedge funds to close their operations in recent months to focus on managing their own wealth, Alexandra Stevenson writes in DealBook. Shutdowns in the industry are not new – in past years, titans like George Soros and Stanley F. Druckenmiller have closed their hedge funds to manage their own money – but these days, hedge fund managers are complaining about external factors that make it more difficult to make money, like the regulatory changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act. For Gideon King, of Loeb King Capital Management, running a hedge fund had just become “too cumbersome,” as he said in January in a letter to investors. “As the endless quest for becoming institutional continues on, the soul of investing might get lost, as the unmitigated compliance processes become cumbersome and interfere with the purity of speculative contemplation,” he wrote.",Blogs,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/morning-agenda-why-hedge-funds-are-closing/

Joyce, the circuit attorney for St. Louis, found that Mr. Myers “produced a gun” during the encounter with the officer, Jason Flanery, who was working an off-duty security detail for a private company. Police had said Mr. Myers, 18, who was black, shot a stolen handgun before Officer Flanery, who is white, returned fire. Prosecutors said in their report that witnesses had seen gunfire coming from both directions and from two guns and that a semiautomatic pistol had been recovered next to Mr. Myers’s body. Mr. Myers’s family disputed the police account and insisted that he had been unarmed. Protesters marched for several nights after the shooting, and some drew parallels between Mr. Myers’s death and that of Mr. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old shot by a white Ferguson officer in August. In a statement, Ms. Joyce expressed condolences to the Myers family and called his death “a tragic situation for our entire community.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/missouri-no-charge-for-st-louis-officer-in-killing.html

He might have gone on like that and had a productive if ultimately forgettable career, were it not for a newspaper series he wrote on the anthropologist Franz Boas that became, for Mitchell, “a kind of graduate-level seminar”: “Don’t take anything for granted,” Boas told him, among other things. The advice helped transform Mitchell from a competent beat reporter with a graceful prose style into, arguably, our greatest literary journalist — a man who wrote about freaks, barkeeps, street preachers, grandiose hobos and other singular specimens of humanity with compassion and deep, hard-earned understanding, and above all with a novelist’s eyes and ears. “When the New Journalists came ashore,” John McPhee observed, “Joe Mitchell was there on the beach to greet them.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/books/review/man-in-profile-joseph-mitchell-of-the-new-yorker-by-thomas-kunkel.html

At the Cures Marines, Nuel highlighted Trouville’s proud literary pedigree with oversized, stenciled quotes about the port town on the walls from writers who lived, worked or played there, including Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Marguerite Duras, the author of “The Lover,” who lived in Trouville for many years.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/normandy-hotel-spa-trouville/

2015-05-19,The Ann Coulter Critique of American Christianity,"My Sunday column discussed recent remarks from President Obama and the sociologist Robert Putnam on American churches and the fight against poverty, in which both men suggested that culture-war fixations have sidelined American Christianity’s mission to the poor. Given the sums raised and man-hours invested by religious groups in charitable work, this is not a particular compelling argument; in fact, it’s pretty dumb, as a number of writers had already pointed out by the time I got around to the subject. So I added my voice to their chorus, but I also tried to raise one possible way in which you could argue that the churches are failing poorer Americans: Not in their charitable works, but in the actual business of soul-winning itself, as evidenced by the fact that downscale Americans are both less likely than the affluent to attend church and less likely to attend, period, than in the recent past. And I noted that you don’t even have to believe in the soul to see this as a failure: Since the social benefits of religion seem to flow through participation and belonging, even from a purely secular perspective (well, if such a thing exists) America’s churches would probably be doing more for the poor than charity alone can offer if they were keeping more people in the pews.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/the-ann-coulter-critique-of-american-christianity/

2015-05-19,A Smoky Bourbon Cocktail from a Legendary Toronto Experimentalist,"Impactful aromatics have always played an essential role in the creations of the Canadian mixologist Frankie Solarik. Inside BarChef, his Modernist cocktail laboratory on Toronto’s Queen Street West, multisensory presentations evoke the flavors of the season — not just in the glass, but surrounding it, too. Solarik’s Spring Thaw is served in a cool, perfumed fog of cedar, lilac and grapefruit, billowing from a bed of wet moss that nestles a glass of vanilla Campari granita swimming in chamomile gin and sparkling wine. That drink’s a showstopper, wafting in all directions across the bar; a perennial Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan (the preference of the rappers Jay-Z and Drake) is more self-contained, infused tableside under one of two antique glass domes. If those drinks appear daunting to replicate, Solarik’s Canadian bestseller bar manual “The Bar Chef: A Modern Approach to Cocktails” ($30, Harper) is released today in the United States. And if the drinks recall the culinary artistry of Grant Achatz’s Alinea, it will come as no surprise that the Chicago chef penned the book’s foreword. “Grant came into BarChef in 2009 when we first opened, and his incorporation of aromatics and theater changed my life,” Solarik recalls of the research trip Achatz took prior to opening The Aviary.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/smoky-bourbon-cocktail-recipe-furlough-toronto/

Now, the art-house favorite is taking his love of the LP a step further and curating an ongoing series of soundtracks in partnership with the Los Angeles-based record label Milan Records. “We thought, why don’t we create our own high-end vinyl collection,” says the Danish filmmaker, who describes wanting to highlight the “exoticness” of the medium. “It’s not so much the music by itself; it’s the whole design, it’s the feel, it’s the weight — it’s like seeing the movie in front of you.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/t-magazine/nicolas-winding-refn-vinyl-curator.html

Jessica Chastain plays Jack’s mother, whose grief, with that of her husband, cast a shadow of tragedy over everything that will follow in this nonlinear film. Hunter McCracken, a first-time actor, is Jack as a boy growing up in Texas. “The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, “but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality.” The movie, which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, received Oscar nominations for best picture, best director and best cinematography, for Emmanuel Lubezki.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

But this sparkling surface glides and washes over quite a bit of disturbing darkness: A teenage girl’s virginity is casually taken by a drunken middle-aged layabout; a teenage boy loses his virginity to a 70-year-old woman; those ancient olive groves are decimated by a secret betrayal. None of this depravity reverberates over the course of the novel; it all happens and, just as quickly, is past.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/books/review/the-rocks-by-peter-nichols.html

Murphy of Brevard County, who was caught on video last year berating and threatening to assault a public defender. The six-member Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission, in findings released Wednesday, unanimously found Judge Murphy guilty of violating various judicial canons, including being “dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and others.” The panel also recommended a fine of up to $50,000, a public reprimand and Judge Murphy’s continued participation in a mental health therapy program. He is accused of hitting a former assistant public defender, Andrew Weinstock, outside a courtroom last June after they exchanged words over whether Mr. Weinstock’s client could have a speedy trial. The Florida Supreme Court will decide on the final punishment. It often adopts the panel’s recommendations. In video and audio recorded inside the courtroom, Judge Murphy is heard expressing frustration at Mr. Weinstock after he announced his intention not to waive the speedy trial right of his client. “You know, if I had a rock, I would throw it at you right now,” the judge said at one point.

I was seated at a table with his associates when the conversation turned to our respective careers. I asked why they had chosen neurosurgery. A young member of the group said: “When you enter the brain, you’re seeing the soul. It’s amazing.” A senior neurosurgeon shook his head and disagreed. “It’s psychiatrists who see the soul — not us.” Later I posed the question to my friend. “The brain is the organ of cognition, perception, consciousness. When you operate, the stakes couldn’t be higher.” Not even for cardiac surgery? “The heart is just a muscle,” he replied.

So it was a natural next step for Subkoff to try her hand at directing. Her new film, “#Horror,” stars Taryn Manning, Natasha Lyonne, Lydia Hearst, Stella Schnabel and Chloë Sevigny (whom Subkoff once enlisted, you may remember, as the creative director for Imitation of Christ); it tells a story of social media gone wrong and cyberbullying taken to nasty extremes. Subkoff just premiered the film at the Cannes Film Festival, where she found plenty to do — from glamorous pool time at the Hotel du Cap to a haunted-house party she hosted at Le Baron, which drew Benicio Del Toro, Michael Fassbender and Larry Gagosian. In the spirit of the film, Subkoff also organized a powerful cyberbullying protest on the Croisette, with over 70 French girls aged 12 to 16 in attendance wearing masks and carrying signs, both of which were created by Subkoff’s husband, the artist Urs Fischer. The protest was shut down by French police (a sure sign, we’d say, that she made an impact).

His hands made bold windmill arcs, scrabbled at trills, picked off single notes and scampered through bluesy squiggles. They were masterly and strategic, defining the sound and structure of each song, yet still reckless. They were exploring, even now, the way his songs are awash in clashing impulses: rebellion, isolation, anger, uncertainty, yearning, fear, lust, frustration, brawling, searching. Three of Mr. Townshend’s many self-questioning manifestos — “I Can’t Explain,” “The Seeker” and “Who Are You” — started a set full of the Who’s surefire material.

That inventor, Yehezkel, a robust bear of a man (Ze’ev Revah) and his wife, Levana (Levana Finkelshtein), a couple in their 70s, are distressed by the acute suffering of their friend Max (Shmuel Wolf), who is dying of cancer and against his will is kept alive by doctors.

There are some beautiful half-tamed raptors, and some lovely shots of them soaring and stooping, but their presence, rather than enabling the story to take flight, helps drag it down into a swamp of grim, portentous mumbo-jumbo.

2015-05-22,CNBC Looks at Costs of Liars and Cheats,"Lying is a crucial element of lots of scripted TV — false-identity dramas like “Revenge,” for instance. It’s pivotal in some game shows, like GSN’s “Lie Detectors.” So why not a documentary? On Thursday at 10 p.m., CNBC obliges with “(Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies,” an illuminating look at the whys, hows and how-oftens of the ancient practice. The program juxtaposes stories of people who have lied — two men from an inside-trader scheme; a woman who used a website that facilitates adulterous hookups; an N.B.A. referee caught in a betting scandal, and more — with studies on the nuts and bolts of lying. That research has produced counterintuitive findings. The high-stakes liars who make headlines, for instance, might draw a disproportionate amount of scorn. “Yes, there are some big cheaters out there,” says Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University, “but they are very rare, and because of that their overall economic impact is relatively low. On the other hand, we have a ton of little cheaters, and because there are so many of us, the economic impact of small cheating is actually incredibly, incredibly high.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/arts/television/cnbc-looks-at-costs-of-liars-and-cheats.html

He doesn’t just transform leaden narratives like the haunted house tale (“House of Leaves”) or the teenage romance (“Only Revolutions”). He transmutes the pages of base books into rare new forms and formats. Alchemists of the past became cult figures by both keeping and revealing secrets. Danielewski actively uses social media to supplement his novels’ cryptic designs, and his website encourages followers to post recondite explications of his works. But MZD or Z, as he signs his books, is no mere masked Internet phenomenon. After one of his college readings, I witnessed cultists clutching ragged texts form a signing line worthy of the T.S.A.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/books/review/the-familiar-by-mark-z-danielewski.html
2015-05-22,"‘The Millionaire and the Bard,’ by Andrea E. Mays","“The Millionaire and the Bard,” by Andrea Mays, is an American love story. It is the engaging chronicle of a sober, hard-working, respectably married industrialist of the Gilded Age who became obsessed with the object of his desire. Though generally frugal and self-­disciplined, he was willing to pay extraordinary sums in order to put his hands on his mistress, to gaze at her lovingly and longingly, to caress her. To possess her only once was not enough for him; he craved the experience again and again, without limit.

2015-05-22,"‘The Book of Aron,’ by Jim Shepard","I finished reading “The Book of Aron” shortly before Yom Hashoah. In ­observance of the day of Holocaust remembrance, the PBS program “Frontline” screened the 1945 documentary “Memory of the Camps.” Partly edited by Alfred Hitchcock, the film is assembled from the scrupulously thorough footage shot by ­Allied forces as they liberated camps such as Dachau, Buchenwald and ­Bergen-Belsen. The narration, recorded by the British actor Trevor Howard in 1985 from the original 1945 script, sounds very strange to 21st-century ears. Although ample in its expressions of sympathy and disgust, it also conveys a tone of shocked naïveté, even a whiff of condescension. The camp survivors are seen but not heard, presented as pitiful, accorded no role in the telling of their own stories.

The former executive, Cho Hyun-ah, was sentenced to 10 months in prison on Friday on charges of violating aviation safety laws. But the court suspended the sentence for two years, meaning she will not serve more prison time as long as she does not commit a crime in the next two years. Ms. Cho, whose father is the chairman of Korean Air, was sentenced to a year in prison in a lower-court ruling in February. She forced a Korean Air plane to return to the gate at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Dec. 5 so the chief steward could be removed. She was angry that a flight attendant had served the nuts without first asking her, then in an unopened package rather than on a plate, according to court documents.

2015-05-22,Inside the List,"Mean Girls: A couple of years ago, when the subject of “likable” characters in fiction resurfaced courtesy of Claire Messud’s “The Woman Upstairs,” the debate touched not only on gender — nobody complains about bad boys, Messud noted — but on genre, with some commentators suggesting unlikable heroines are automatically seen as more “literary.” But of course pop fiction has long embraced difficult women: Consider Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl,” which blithely ruled the best-seller list even as the likability argument raged around it. Now there’s another mean girl in the clique: Ani FaNelli, the protagonist of Jessica Knoll’s “Luckiest Girl Alive,” new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 12. Ani writes a sex column for a women’s magazine and schemes to land a trophy husband; some reviewers have called her the mirror image of Amy Dunne in “Gone Girl,” since Ani seems purely manipulative at the start but becomes more human as the book reveals its secrets. Knoll, a former editor at Cosmopolitan and Self, told me there’s a feminist case to be made for unlikable women. “Men who are ruthless and aggressive in pursuit of their goals are acting within their culturally sanctioned bounds,” she said via email, “and we admire them for that. Women who do the same are punished because that hard-nosed behavior is counter to how we believe women should be, which is kind, nurturing and selfless. The knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss Ani as vain and vapid. But when we reward women for showing their full range of humanity, warts and all, when we give their struggles weight, we allow for the possibility that their flaws and stories can endear, inspire and move us, just like those of men.” A little spice is O.K., in other words, but please hold the sugar.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/inside-the-list.html

What it does is jammy, fuzzed-out and discursive, full of soul vocals and twin-guitar arrangements; it brings together elements of cumbia, bolero, vallenato and the Brazilian pop experimentalists of the late ’60s and early ’70s. The band members play in ruffled, powder-blue tuxedo shirts and deliver party music from top to bottom, with stylish attention to tube amps and analog warmth. But their sets are serious business: You can climb into one of them and follow it a long way.

The crime and the trial spawned a media circus, novels, plays and films. On Wednesday at the Chocolate Factory in Queens, the performance artist Rebecca Patek added another work to the pile. The Leopold and Loeb case, though, is not the only subject of Ms. Patek’s jumbled, hourlong “The Future Was Looking Better in the Past.” (The subtitle runs on for 28 more words.) The murderers and their victim are played by dancer-actors, who recite segments of actual and imagined courtroom testimony and who appear in video re-enactments and fantasies. But the same performers also portray Ms. Patek and an interviewer discussing the process and motivations behind this show. (Here, and in the program bio, Ms. Patek claims to be related to Loeb.) Threaded in alternation with these two strands is a third, given in audio with subtitles, as if from a wiretap recording.

(HBO) DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) A decade has passed on screen since “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” and millions of people have fallen prey to a lethal virus, leaving survivors to cobble together a society in the ruins of San Francisco, where Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the former police chief, is in charge. But across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County, the upright-walking chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his team have built their own civilization, complete with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated sign language and an education system overseen by the orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). But when the humans ask to encroach on their territory to build a hydroelectric station, the alarms are sounded — and schisms formed. “It’s a satisfying movie and an example — a dispiritingly rare one these days — of what mainstream Hollywood filmmaking can still achieve,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Matt Reeves’s Oscar nominee for best achievement in visual effects. “That we have progressed from ‘Rise’ only as far as ‘Dawn’ suggests many future sequels, which may, in this case, be a source of hope as well as dread, provided that civilization doesn’t collapse in the meantime.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

The loyal relation existing according to treaty between Austria-Hungary and the German Empire which has been still more firmly welded by comradeship in arms has remained uninjured by the defection of the third ally and her desertion to the enemies’ camp. The German Ambassador, Prince Bülow, has therefore received instructions to leave Rome conjointly with the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Baron Macchio.’’ Prince Bülow left Rome this evening at 9.45.

The two and many others have opened up, however, to two reporters from The Globe and Mail in Toronto: Jacquie McNish, a senior business writer and author of several books and Sean Silcoff, who reports about the company. The resulting book, “Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry,” which will be published in the United States on Tuesday, fills in some details of the early history of BlackBerry.

Boyett, the show’s executive producer, in a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter. The Olsen twins started filming in the role of Michelle at 9 months old, and remained on the show for its full eight seasons. They now run Dualstar, a lifestyle and fashion company. The new season will center on other members of the original Tanner clan, including D. J. (Candace Cameron Bure) and Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin). The Olsens’ former co-star John Stamos, who announced the show’s return on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” last month, tweeted that he was “heartbroken” the twins would not be returning.

She also noted that the bonus, first reported by The New York Post, was based on 18 months of work, not 12. Mr. Levy spent 11 years as president of the performing arts center, where he was renowned for his fund-raising abilities and applauded for completing an ambitious $1.2 billion renovation project. His recently released memoir, “They Told Me Not to Take That Job: Tumult, Betrayal, Heroics, and the Transformation of Lincoln Center,” depicts the interior struggles over the renovation and included criticism of other New York cultural executives.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/arts/lincoln-center-president-saw-increase-in-bonus.html

The contemporary refectory in the heart of the city’s under-resourced Greco neighborhood will host a coterie of Bottura’s most charitable colleagues, beginning with Eleven Madison Park’s Daniel Humm and former Chez Panise chef Seen Lippert, eager to make a feast of the exposition’s transported food waste for those most in need by performing culinary alchemy twice daily in a glass-enclosed stage. “At lunchtime, there are going to be students there; and the very best chefs in the world, the rock ‘n’ roll stars, will be cooking scraps for them,” says Bottura of the facility’s secondary mission. “It’s like the Pope washing the feet of the people in the street.” While Bottura’s inspiration for the project draws on local influences including the Italian cinematic fantasia “Miracle in Milan” and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” his greatest motivator has been Pope Francis, whose spontaneous utterance of “Buon pranzo!” (“Good lunch!”) five days into his papacy inspired a renewed sense of faith within the chef. “Introducing himself with those words reminds everyone to start each day with humility, and humility is the most important thing,” Bottura says, “because from there others are going to follow you.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/t-magazine/massimo-bottura-expo-milano-recipe.html

Like the elder Toogood’s celebrated furniture and interiors, the project — which introduces its second collection this spring, though the sisters disavow the concept of fashion seasons — is a humanistic exploration of the possibilities of handicraft. Each unisex, oversize piece is named for a profession (the plumber jumpsuit, the beekeeper jacket) and finished with droll details (handpainted mask appliqués, “Abolish the High Street” spelled out in frayed rope) that must be seen in person to be fully appreciated.

It’s the first fast-food venture from the upmarket deli group Ottolenghi — conceived by Noam Bar, the longstanding business partner, and former boyfriend, of the influential chef and food writer Yotam Ottolenghi. “It’s a happy marriage between meat, fresh salad and beautiful condiments,” explains the Haifa-raised creator of Sesame’s spiced lamb kebab, which is served in the traditional Turkish style with mint yogurt, tahini, zhough (a Yemenite chili paste) and a pared-down version of the signature Ottolenghi salad — all neatly encased in the most pillowy pitta you’re likely to encounter this side of Istanbul. “An awful lot of thought went into the spices,” Bar says. “There’s even some cinnamon in there.” Inspiration for Sesame struck the Ottolenghi co-founder as he raced around central London looking for on-the-run lunch offerings: “The possibilities are still pretty limited,” he says, adding, “I thought, ‘Enough of the sandwiches!’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/t-magazine/londons-new-trio-of-exceptional-kebabs.html

Christian Roberts plays Denham, the arrogant teenager who incites Thackeray’s latest classroom edict: If the students want to be treated as the adults they are about to become, they must act like adults. “A nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times about James Clavell’s drama. “And so ‘To Sir, With Love’ comes off as a cozy, good-humored and unbelievable little tale of a teacher getting acquainted with his pupils, implying but never stating that it is nice for the races to live congenially together.” The singer Lulu performs the title song, which became a No. 1 hit.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

2015-05-27,Horror,"Thank God for evil. Without it, horror fiction would be a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick or, perhaps, a ragged, bloody, roughly handled zombie action figure for gullible children. That, of course, is what contemporary horror actually is, most of the time. For some writers, though, the damned soul does sometimes clap its hands and sing. Clive Barker knows the tune, and in his new novel, THE SCARLET GOSPELS (St. Martin’s, $26.99), he belts it out as rapturously as an Irish tenor crooning “Danny Boy.” Better than half the action of “The Scarlet Gospels” takes place in hell, where Barker is clearly very much at home. His descriptions of the underworld often recall the grotesque tableaus of Hieronymus Bosch, but are at other times weirdly hushed and lyrical: “The sky contained neither sun, nor stars, which was predictable enough, but what it did contain was a stone the size of a small planet. The stone reached high above the immense landscape that spread out below, and it threw off fissures like lightning bolts, through which brightness poured. The effect upon the vast panorama was uncanny.” In Barker’s work, beauty and evil are an old married couple, living together comfortably, even serenely, with no secrets left from one another.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/horror.html

Or consider this story, one told to me 20 years ago by a member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, the writer-rock band. (Now that might be an oxymoron.) The band stopped for breakfast at a small-town truck stop before the sun was up. This was pre-smartphone, pre-social media, practically pre-Internet.

The police estimate that there are as many as 10,000 gang members in Stanislaus County, where Modesto is, most either Norteños and Sureños, two of California’s most notorious Latino street gangs. The feud between them often turns deadly, and according to Thomas Brennan, the district attorney, this was one such instance: Sebourn and his co-defendants were Sureño gang members hunting for rivals on Valentine’s Day in 2013, when they found Gomez, out on a walk with his girlfriend.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/magazine/how-do-you-define-a-gang-member.html

The work itself, considered one of the most important American paintings of its kind, has hung in the National Gallery of Art in Washington for so many decades — regularly since 1956 — that it long ago came to seem like a part of the museum’s fabric. But the painting was privately owned, for many years by the Pell family and then by the Detroit collector Richard Manoogian, who bought it in 1986 for $6 million, at the time the most ever paid privately or at auction for an American painting. Now, the National Gallery has brought the boatmen fully into the fold, acquiring the painting from the Richard and Jane Manoogian Foundation for an undisclosed price.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/arts/design/national-gallery-buys-george-caleb-binghams-the-jolly-flatboatmen.html

2015-05-29,Review: ‘Results’ Tracks Exertions in Matters of the Cardio,"“Results” is something of a paradox: a straightforward movie that reveals itself by stealth and indirection. Tracing the awkward interactions of three Austin, Tex., residents — a personal trainer, her boss and an out-of-shape client — the film seems to wander amiably, almost aimlessly through daily routines and low-key surprises. Only toward the end do you realize that the characters have been arranged into a pleasing and familiar romantic-comedy triangle and that you’ve been watching a beautifully played game of underhand slow-pitch screwball.

But defense appeals are likely to extend the case for years, and there is no telling when or even whether an execution might take place. Twenty survivors and relatives of victims of the bombing are expected to speak at the sentencing hearing. Mr. Tsarnaev, 21, may also speak if he wishes; he did not testify during his trial.

But Mr. Peterson, who has been a vocal opponent of the bill, said on Thursday that he believed the law was unconstitutional because it effectively changed the sentences of the 10 inmates on death row. One senator who opposed repeal of the death penalty has begun another effort to fight the new law and is trying to collect at least 115,000 signatures from registered voters, which would force a voter referendum in 2016.

(13) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA: ANDRIS NELSONS’ INAUGURAL CONCERT Mr. Nelsons (above), the Latvian conductor, makes his debut as the ensemble’s music director in this program of Wagnerian and Italian verismo repertory, featuring his wife, the soprano Kristine Opolais, and the German tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Among the works in this “Great Performances” presentation, taped in September, are Wagner’s “Tannhäuser” overture, which Mr. Nelsons has credited with inspiring him at the age of 5 to pursue a life in music. “As he walked to the podium on Saturday he was greeted with a long, rousing ovation; many people were on their feet,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times in his review of that concert. “But the best indication that Mr. Nelsons was a strong choice for the job was the superb playing of the musicians of this great orchestra, especially in, of all things, Respighi’s familiar 1924 symphonic poem, ‘Pines of Rome.’ If you are going to conclude an important inaugural concert with a shameless showpiece, well, picking this skillfully written, dazzlingly orchestrated and colorful score was the way to go. Mr. Nelsons drew a glittering, textured and cinematic account of that 20-minute work from his players.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

Instead, Moraes says, develop your core strength. He did 2,000 crunches a day during the 15 years he competed with the Professional Bull Riders, the international organization known as the P.B.R., eventually becoming its first three-time world champion. Bulls can weigh up to 2,200 pounds and are bred for their explosive leaps and midair spins. “Dance with the bull,” advises Moraes, 45, who retired in 2008 and now scouts talent (bovine and human) and runs events for the P.B.R. in his native Brazil. “Never try to fight; if you fight, you always lose.” Stay up near the animal’s shoulders, away from its high-kicking hindquarters.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/magazine/how-to-ride-a-bull.html

Instead, Mr. Fuld offered his views on personal topics and made frequent references to his resilience. One example: “What did Rocky say? ‘It’s not how hard you hit but whether you get up after you’ve been knocked down.’ I love Rocky.” ",Blogs,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/morning-agenda-fuld-breaks-his-silence/

In Benton’s case, “run” is almost literal; everything in the fluid, vivid murals that made him famous seems to be pulsing or coursing. His pictures were, in a sense, motion pictures, which may be why, in 1937, Life magazine commissioned him to go to Hollywood to create a “movie mural” that would bring its readers closer to the heart of the still-newish mystery of how films were created.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/american-epics-thomas-hart-benton-and-hollywood.html

Where to adjust the register without straying beyond the fixed range? One of the many delights vouchsafed by Robert ­Merle’s “The Brethren” is the sense that the author is astonished that what he’s writing about actually happened — that 450 years ago France consisted of a batch of tenuously ­allied provinces, with Catholics and Protestants locked in holy and civil war; that 14-year-old ­nobles were joined in ­marriage; that kings died in jousting ­matches; that Gypsies haunted untamed forests; that castles were ­defended with blunderbusses and cutlasses. Where Merle teases this history is through his invented Huguenot family, headed by two Jeans, the exemplary Baron Jean de Siorac and his austere best friend, Jean de Sauveterre — the “brethren” of the novel’s title, united by war and joint masters of Mespech, a castle in ­southern Périgord.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/the-brethren-by-robert-merle.html

For three Japanese girls in 1871 — Sutematsu Yamakawa, age 11; Shige Nagai, 10; and Ume Tsuda, 6 — study abroad began much earlier and lasted for 10 long years. They were transformed in the process, as was the country they left behind. “Though they were, each of them, purebred daughters of the samurai,” Janice P.

Handy titillated the nation with “Beale Street Blues,” his song about a true-life Sodom and Gomorrah in downtown Memphis. “If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,” he wrote, “married men would have to take their beds and walk.” Fats Waller, Lena Horne and the former Beale resident Alberta Hunter all went on to sing it, but probably few people today know about that post-Civil War nirvana for liberated slaves. On Beale Street, freedom ran raucously, dangerously amok. Races cohabited and brothels thrived; heated games of dice-rolling often ended with the flash of switchblades. Cocaine was sold over the counter. The anarchy was set to a soundtrack of early jazz, much of it provided by Handy, the bandleader and composer of “St. Louis Blues.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/beale-street-dynasty-and-dreams-to-remember.html

McCloud drew himself as a friendly, bespectacled guide, demonstrating why “cartoony,” stylized faces (as in “Peanuts”) help us identify with characters; and how comics can tell many sorts of stories, whether or not there are superpowers or family traumas involved. “Reinventing Comics” (2000) predicted broad uses for digital platforms; “Making Comics” (2006) showed potential creators how to use the pen-and-ink and electronic tools we have.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/the-sculptor-by-scott-mccloud.html

2015-05-29,Inside the List,"Feeling Lucky: To anybody who’s known a toddler, it might seem counterintuitive that the children’s picture book list at the moment is so stable and calm — seven of this week’s 10 entries have been on the list for six months or longer. (In some cases much longer: Hervé Tullet’s “Press Here” is coming up on four years.) That means that Dan Santat’s sweet story “The Adventures of Beekle,” about an imaginary friend in search of his human, is a relative newcomer: It’s No. 7 after 13 weeks. Santat’s book got a bump when it won the Caldecott Medal in February, setting it apart as last year’s “most distinguished American picture book.” The award caught Santat off guard, he told Publishers Weekly at the time. “I never really thought that I had a chance,” he said. “When I got the call, I hate to admit it, but I started crying. I crumpled to the floor and started crying.” Santat has illustrated other people’s books for a long time (he previously hit the list as the illustrator for Ahmet Zappa’s “Because I’m Your Dad,” in 2013), but “The Adventures of Beekle” is just the second story he’s written on his own. He almost chose not to, he told Publishers Weekly: Five years ago he had a chance to join Google, drawing doodles for the home page. “Should I take this job and make money to support my family,” he asked himself, “or should I chase my dream?” Turning Google down, he continued, “motivated me to use the other side of my creative brain, to write more.” It paid off. Among the highlights of Santat’s February, according to his Tumblr account, was outselling “50 Shades of Grey” (“for a brief moment”) and receiving the following Valentine’s “newsletter” from his 9-year-old son, Alek: “Dan Santat has just won his amazing Caldecott award.

The installation represents the return of “Excursus” to public view almost 17 years after its premiere at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea, where it became a kind of touchstone of Mr. Irwin’s working methods.

It remains coherent and unified no matter how much it drifts and disorients.

2015-06-01,Review: Stephen King Leaps Through Time in ‘Finders Keepers’,"Stephen King has won many specialized awards — the Black Quill, the Balrog, the Bram Stoker, just to name a few of the B’s — during his long, incredibly prolific career. But until April he had never won an Edgar for best novel. This is the greatest genre-specific accolade available for crime books and thrillers, and Mr. King finally won it for “Mr. Mercedes,” an atypical King novel published last June. It features a vicious, teasing killer determined to inflict mass violence on crowds of Americans. And it describes him in what is, for Mr. King, a pretty no-frills fashion.

2015-06-01,"Review: ‘The Sleeping Beauty,’ Reawakened by American Ballet Theater","The ballet of “The Sleeping Beauty” — new in St. Petersburg in 1890 — addresses tradition, renewal and diverse aspects of dance theater. To Serge Diaghilev, the idea of staging it in the West first arose from Tchaikovsky’s music, which, in 1920, he and Stravinsky (Russians unable to return to Russia) found themselves continually playing. But when Diaghilev’s production was realized, in London in 1921 with designs by Léon Bakst, Stravinsky found that its greatest revelation was not Tchaikovsky’s score — for many of us the best and most abundant of all his compositions — but Marius Petipa’s choreography. Its classicism showed, as Stravinsky wrote in his “An Autobiography,” “the triumph of rule over the arbitrary” and “the perfect expression of the Apollonian principle.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/arts/dance/review-the-sleeping-beauty-reawakened-by-american-ballet-theater.html

Make Room!” Sketching a dystopian world in which too many people scrambled for too few resources, the book became the basis for a 1973 film about a hellish future, “Soylent Green.” In 1969, the pop duo Zager and Evans reached the top of the charts with a number called “In the Year 2525,” which postulated that humans were on a clear path to doom.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/us/the-unrealized-horrors-of-population-explosion.html
