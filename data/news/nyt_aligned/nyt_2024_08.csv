It had the sweetness of a plantain and the texture of a yam, and it propelled him back into the kitchen to tell the cooks to try it, too.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/t-magazine/potato-pizza-blue-hill-at-stone-barns.html
2024-08-05,"A Plant-Based Chair, Three Years in the Making","While on a 2014 trip to Jalapão, a region in the central Brazilian state of Tocantins that’s known for its unlikely combination of springs and sand dunes, the furniture designer Humberto Campana, 71, purchased about 30 disks wound from the golden-hued stems of capim dourado, a grasslike plant native to the area. The disks, which are sometimes used as potholders, sat in his São Paulo studio for five years until he wondered whether they could be joined to make a kind of tapestry that could in turn become a chair. That chair ended up with a bowl-like seat fashioned from a lattice of double-sided circles — sheepskin cutouts in the front and capim dourado disks in the back — though arriving at the finished prototype took another nine months of tinkering.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/t-magazine/humberto-campana-jalapao-chair.html
2024-08-05,A Performance Piece That Required a Fencing Coach and a Sex Doll Maker,"From noon to 9 on a Wednesday this past June, the Canadian artist Miles Greenberg, 26, stood in Walker Court at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto and sliced the air with swords and daggers. Instead of dueling a human opponent, he squared off against a camera held by a robotic arm that countered and recorded his movements. All around him, strewn across the mirrored floor, were nine uncanny silicone sculptures of his likeness positioned as if they’d already been slain. Occasionally the artist stabbed one of his clones, picking up its weapon before reassuming his position in front of the camera.

2024-08-05,Everyone Who Made This Happen: Meet the Many People It Takes to Produce One Thing,"Even works of art that we think of as coming from the minds of lone creative geniuses were group efforts: Michelangelo, for example, recruited some 11 painters to assist him with the Sistine Chapel. The contemporary land artist Michael Heizer, who makes sculptures out of dirt, rocks and negative space in the Nevada desert, and whom The Times once called “art’s last, lonely cowboy,” has relied on a crew of construction workers to help execute his vision. Still, it’s only in the past few decades that attitudes around labor and the power of collectivism have shifted, making artists not only quicker to collaborate but also to give credit where credit is due. Reflecting on “Womanhouse,” the multiroom feminist art installation that debuted in Los Angeles in 1972 and was created by Judy Chicago, Miriam Schapiro and over 20 California Institute of the Arts students and local artists, Schapiro told the writer Judith E. Stein, “Collaboration was taking place right then and there in my brain and liberating me from the idea of being solitary.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/t-magazine/teams-artists-food-theater-fashion.html

2024-08-05,The People Reimagining ‘Spirited Away’ With Puppets,"There was never any doubt as to whether the director John Caird’s stage adaptation of “Spirited Away” would incorporate puppets. They were part of his original pitch to Hayao Miyazaki, the writer and director of the beloved 2001 animated film, in which the heroine, Chihiro, and her parents are transported to another world populated by a colorful cast of Japanese spirits and gods. The questions were, which characters should be puppets, and how would they look and work? Toby Olié, 39, the show’s puppetry designer and director, sketched some initial ideas. Then, in 2021, he and Caird; Caird’s co-adapter and wife, Maoko Imai; the set designer Jon Bausor; and six performer-puppeteers held a two-week workshop in a church hall in East London, during which they explored staging with foam and cardboard prototypes.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/t-magazine/spirited-away-puppets-hayao-miyazaki-john-caird.html
2024-08-05,Why It Took 30 People to Make This Tote Bag,"When Matthieu Blazy was named the creative director of Bottega Veneta in 2021, he urged his staff to find innovative ways of working with leather. This meant looking past the intrecciato, the 58-year-old brand’s trademark technique of braiding flat strips of leather, often into a slanted grid pattern. One of their responses was the Kalimero bucket bag, which is made, without a single stitch, by weaving a single piece of leather around a wood block and was featured in the opening look of Blazy’s first runway presentation three months later. Last summer, after seeing a picture of Sicilian basketry in a book about the island’s craft traditions, the French Belgian designer, 40, issued an updated challenge: to fuse the house’s methods with those of ancestral basket weaving. If his team could make leather resemble denim — or silk or flannel — Blazy, who delights in trompe l’oeil, thought, why not cane, willow or other plant materials?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/t-magazine/bottega-veneta-tote-bag.html

I can’t remember the title — the man wrote more than 100 pulp novels, mostly in his bathtub — but I remember the cover: a cowboy on horseback splashing across a creek, leading a packhorse. He was wearing a six-gun and looking over his shoulder with a hard, desperate expression, and I thought, “I want to do that: I want to be desperate and hard and unbeholden, and drift the high lonesome on horseback.” Years later, when I finally got to Paonia, Colo., I bought a horse and borrowed a packhorse and rode to Wyoming.

2024-08-07,A Necklace After Yves Saint Laurent’s Own Heart,"Born in 1936, Yves Saint Laurent grew up in a house overlooking the Mediterranean Sea in Oran, Algeria, where his father managed an insurance company and owned a handful of cinemas. As a teenager, Saint Laurent became fascinated with the theater — even creating a miniature stage set with a wooden crate and cardboard characters in costumes that he designed himself using fabric snipped from his mother’s dresses. In 1954, at age 18, he moved to Paris and studied fashion design at the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. Less than a year later, he met Christian Dior, who hired him on the spot as a studio assistant. After Dior’s sudden death in 1957, Saint Laurent, then 21, became the world’s youngest couturier. In 1960, he was fired from the house but, with the help of his partner, the industrialist Pierre Bergé, he opened his own couture salon the following year in an airy townhouse in the 16th Arrondissement. Despite their meticulous construction, Saint Laurent’s garments — a peacoat, for instance, inspired by a sailor’s jacket and worn over white shantung pants — liberated the female form. Beginning with his spring 1962 show, and appearing in nearly every collection between fall 1979 and his final presentation in 2002, he’d dress one model (often his favorite that season) in a heart-shaped necklace created by Roger Scemama. Saint Laurent was so fond of the coeur fétiche, as the original and its subsequent iterations were known — variations on an asymmetrical pendant encrusted in smoky gray diamonds, red crystals and pearl teardrop cabochons — that he kept one of them in his own apartment on the Rue de Babylone.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/t-magazine/saint-laurent-coeur-fetiche-heart-necklace.html

2024-08-08,The Artists Remaking Everyday Buildings in Dollhouse Scale,"IN A QUIET studio on Skeppsholmen, the small, wooded island in central Stockholm, the Swedish artist Christopher Robin Nordström spends hours immersed in a miniature version of Tokyo. He tracks the slow deterioration of the Japanese city’s more nondescript storefronts and homes via Google Maps: the way awnings fade, the path that water damage takes across a facade. His work consists of remaking these buildings, with their mundane imperfections, at sizes that mean they could fit neatly into his bike basket. “It intrigues me that Tokyo is a megacity built up of mini houses,” says Nordström, 44, who designed accessories for a major fast-fashion brand before shifting his attention to scale-model making during the pandemic. He fell in love with the city on his first visit, in 2018, and recently spent over a year creating a knee-high likeness of a three-story apartment block in the Taito Ward, which he was drawn to for what he calls its “very normal” residential quality. The walls are stuccoed in fine-grained sand repurposed from nesting materials for guinea pig habitats, and the frosted windows were cut from the plastic of translucent three-ring binders. Peering through the panes, you can make out a stack of thimble-like ramen bowls, each one formed with the help of a machine used to cast molds of teeth.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/t-magazine/miniatures-city-artists.html

Etro, who’s 61 and avoids the cruisier spots along the coastline these days, suggests another reason why men from Rome, Milan and other European cities have begun transforming the area’s castles and masserias into hotels and guesthouses, or why discreet foreign dignitaries have set up weekend refuges: For two decades, the region has been governed by leftists; Puglia’s current president, Michele Emiliano, “is very gay-friendly,” Etro says. The previous president, Nichi Vendola, who served for a decade until 2015, was himself a gay man, one of the first out politicians in Italy. But Etro has more outré theories, too: “It’s also because of the inhabitants, you know? Being a little bit Greek,” he notes with a smile, referring to when Puglia was colonized by the Greeks in the eighth century B.C. “There are a lot of bisexual people here.

Muholi also meets them at Pride rallies and protests for L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ rights in Johannesburg and Cape Town before taking the sitters’ portraits in a setting of their choosing. Muholi, who identifies as nonbinary, has a nomadic artistic practice; they move their studio with them through the country. “I work as I go. From any space. Whenever I feel like photographing [and wherever] is safe and conducive for a shoot,” they say. Their portraits are often black and white, which Muholi considers more timeless and less noisy than color, but the works are in no way quiet. In their self-portraits, Muholi’s use of deep saturation and heavy contrasts not only dramatizes the pigment of their skin but also blurs the line between photography and painting. Their portraits of others are typically more spare but are similarly striking, thanks to the direct eye contact of the sitters, who seem to be assessing the viewer in return and whom Muholi calls “participants” rather than “subjects.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/t-magazine/zanele-muholi-tate-modern-sfmoma.html

2024-08-13,The Tonka Bean Is Banned. So Why Is It Popping Up on Dessert Menus?,"The tonka bean, a wizened-looking South American seed, is beloved for its complex almond-vanilla scent, often appearing as an ingredient in perfumes. Outside the United States, it has also long been utilized by chefs, but studies have indicated that coumarin, a chemical compound in the plant, can cause liver damage in animals, and the Food and Drug Administration banned the bean in commercial foods in 1954. Now, with reports that the minuscule amounts used to impart big flavor are harmless (and the F.D.A. seemingly not particularly interested in enforcing the ban in recent years), tonka is showing up on dessert menus here. Thea Gould, 30, the pastry chef at the daytime luncheonette La Cantine and evening wine bar Sunsets in Bushwick, Brooklyn, was introduced to tonka after the restaurant’s owner received a jar from France, where it’s a widely used ingredient. Gould says the bean is an ideal stand-in for nuts — a common allergen — and infuses it into panna cotta, whipped cream and Pavlova. Ana Castro, 35, the chef and owner of the New Orleans seafood restaurant Acamaya, discovered tonka as a young line cook at Betony, the now-closed Midtown Manhattan restaurant. Entranced by the ingredient’s grassy, stone fruit-like notes, she’s used it to flavor a custardy corn nicuatole, steeped it into roasted candy squash purée and grated it fresh over a lush tres leches cake. And at the Musket Room in New York’s NoLIta, the pastry chef Camari Mick, 30, balances tonka’s richness with acidic citrus like satsuma and bergamot. Over the past year, she’s incorporated it into a silky lemon bavarois and a candy cap mushroom pot de crème and whipped it into ganache for a poached pear belle Hélène. “Some people ask our staff, ‘Isn’t tonka illegal?’” she says. Their answer: Our pastry chef’s got a guy. — Tanya Bush",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/t-magazine/tonka-bean-dessert-gran-via-madrid-guide.html

The book contains photos from “Yokosuka Story,” a 1970s series focusing on her hometown, the location of a major U.S. Navy base, and a still-life of a lipstick, part of her “Mother’s” (2000-2005) series, for which she photographed her deceased mother’s possessions. One of the youngest photographers in the book, Momo Okabe, 43, trains her lens on her own body and those of her friends, capturing both everyday experiences and life-changing events such as gender-affirming surgery and pregnancy. From photojournalism to works of collage, the book, as its introduction states, “lays the groundwork for understanding the enormity of what has been overlooked.” “I’m So Happy You Are Here” is out on Sept. 17, $75, aperture.org.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/t-magazine/gare-de-lyon-paris-restaurant-marius.html

One day she went out to walk her dog, and a stranger asked if she was OK. She realized that her clothing was smeared with red paint — she looked as if she had just been through some violent event. “Am I OK?” she wondered. Maybe the aversion to white came from memories of being in the hospital, she thought. Or maybe it was about understanding “the dark side of the worship of purity and minimalism.” Whatever the reason, she started making many red paintings, some of which depicted women pumping milk.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/t-magazine/camille-henrot-motherhood-art.html

In 1996, the couple moved into what was then a 6,000-square-foot bungalow, built in 1956 by the American designer Cliff May. They got married in the backyard some months later. Their son, Anthony, now 24 and studying law in New York, celebrated his bar mitzvah there. Over the years, the three-bedroom home has been a place to sit shiva, observe holidays and throw awards season after-parties. And in February 2015, when Pascal was pushed out after nearly a decade as a co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment — one of the many consequences of the Sony cyberattack involving leaked company data and employee emails — it also became a refuge. “The house is a part of our family,” says Pascal, 66, on a December morning in their sun-dappled living room, which overlooks a fragrant tangle of peach, kumquat and plumeria trees and a swimming pool lined with green slate tiles. “You look forward to coming back here for serenity,” says Weinraub, 86, as the couple’s dogs lounge next to them on a sofa upholstered in gold velvet.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/t-magazine/los-angeles-home-amy-pascal.html

The case that concluded that day, Bosnia v. Serbia, was to determine whether Serbia had violated the Genocide Convention during the Bosnian War, when Bosnian Serb forces killed an estimated 100,000 civilians. Čekić, then the director of Sarajevo University’s Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law and a Bosnian victim of the war, had hoped the court, which is based in The Hague, would punish his compatriots’ deaths and acknowledge them as victims of genocide. Instead, the court declined to classify a vast majority of the Bosnian deaths as genocidal. For Čekić and other survivors, the ruling was a betrayal: They felt that the court had refused to recognize the true nature of the violence. Newspapers reported that Serbia had been found not guilty of genocide; a celebration was planned at the Serbian Embassy. Standing outside the I.C.J., the top court of the United Nations, Čekić tore the text of the judgment to pieces.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/magazine/genocide-definition.html

Gargiulo and Remsing talked about how they might work together to bottle the landscape they both know well.

This month, Vintner’s Daughter will debut Understory Vol. 2, which Gargiulo describes as a “new vintage” with subtle differences from its predecessor — the violet notes are stronger while the moss is softer in this iteration. The brand will release a limited run of 500 bottles of perfume oil, this time featuring illustrations by the artist MarSha Yi Robinson. “I love the idea of [Understory] being something that comes and goes, almost like scent itself,” Gargiulo says. $245, vintnersdaughter.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/t-magazine/copenhagen-rooftop-bar.html

But in Orange County, where I’m from, flip-flops function in a way that’s only suggested elsewhere: They complete a tableau of carefree, sand-speckled revelry — an endless, almost utopian vision of joblessness and idle bliss. Even the PacSun and Hollister ads, set in an idealized Orange County, are too charged with a manufactured spring-break debauchery to accurately capture the mellow SoCal lassitude. In the O.C., flip-flops were flimsy foot skis meant to help people reach a secluded surf spot — for hopping in cars or treading lightly atop sand dunes.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/magazine/flip-flops-new-york.html
2024-08-27,Why Is the Loneliness Epidemic So Hard to Cure?,"In the early months of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic settled over the country, a psychologist and Harvard lecturer named Richard Weissbourd approached his colleagues with a concept for a new kind of study. Loneliness, or the specter of it, seemed to Weissbourd to be everywhere — in the solitude of quarantine, in the darkened windows of the buildings on campus, in the Zoom squares that had come to serve as his primary conduit to his students. Two years earlier, he read a study from Cigna, the insurance provider, showing that 46 percent of Americans felt sometimes or always alone. In 2019, when Cigna replicated the study, the number of lonely respondents had grown to 52 percent. God knows what the data would say now, Weissbourd thought.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/magazine/loneliness-epidemic-cure.html

The 64-year-old artist, who creates detailed, large-scale watercolors of exotic animals, has spent more than a decade building a collection of vintage composite animal figures. (The term “composite” describes the linoleum-like mixture used to create toys before plastic became manufacturers’ medium of choice.) Only two main companies in Germany produced this now-rare product — typically no more than 2 inches high and 2 inches long — between the early 1900s and World War II. “If you’re an artist who studies animal anatomy, you are blown away by these things,” Ford says. “It’s like you have these little zoo animals in the room.” Many of the creatures’ poses will look familiar to fans of Ford’s art; he frequently works from photographs of them. The artist, whose sketches, watercolors and studies are on view at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York through Oct. 20, says that being greeted by the tiny animals each day reminds him “what my purpose is.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/t-magazine/walton-ford-animal-figurine-collection.html

That the film’s directors, Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, both got their start (and met each other) as clowns is no surprise.

Or Did It?,"Last Oct. 10, my wife, a friend and I arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport to fly to Paris on a trip we had originally planned for April but had to postpone. At the United Airlines check-in counter, agents told us our reservation had been canceled — by us! Even weirder, the same thing had happened three weeks earlier, when the airline sent us an email saying we had canceled our trip. That time, we called and insisted United reissue the reservation for the same price, which it did by giving us a travel voucher and instantly redeeming it. At the airport, though, we watched as supervisors got their supervisors involved, and we were eventually told that something about the voucher had raised questions about fraud. We missed our flight and bought last-minute tickets for that evening’s 11 p.m. United flight to Paris. Then that flight was canceled, though this time for everyone. Given the day’s stress and frustration, we gave up on the trip, had dinner and went to the airport Marriott before heading home the next morning. We believe United owes us for the cost of the last-minute flight ($4,475), a portion of the earlier canceled flight ($3,099), the cost of our transportation, hotel and meals that day ($1,178) and the money we lost on nonrefundable plans in France ($2,007).

Among the area’s most compelling new businesses is La Embajada, a design shop housed in a 1923 Craftsman bungalow. Combining the hospitality and interiors expertise of its founder, Raul Cabra — who has designed tableware for some of Mexico City’s most celebrated restaurants, including Rosetta and Pujol — La Embajada presents a refined, regionally diverse selection of Mexico’s artisanal offerings. A series of small rooms display vintage and contemporary furniture, from stately midcentury armchairs and 1970s glass sconces to a minimalist agave fiber rug by the Oaxaca-based textile artist Trine Ellitsgaard. The house is also an actual residence. Cabra often stays in the bedroom up the creaky stairs, and he’s recently made it available for short-term stays (bookings include a daily basket of baked goods from Austin’s Swedish Hill). Guests can purchase the room’s handmade décor, such as a pair of sleek bedside lamps in milky white onyx, a 1960s La Malinche dresser and a bedspread from a Michoacan manufacturer that once supplied Herman Miller. Downstairs, glassware, candles and gifts fill a section modeled after a typical general store in a small Mexican town. But La Embajada’s heart is its inviting kitchen, where visiting chefs cook elaborate meals and staff prepare ice cream and coffee. In another twist, every bespoke detail — including a hammered copper sink, caramel-colored tiles and waxed pine cabinets — can be custom-ordered for one’s own home.

In nonfiction, we recommend a group biography of the women who challenged social strictures in 18th-century England (that one’s more glitter than doom), a serious study of the people who helped prop up Hitler and his genocidal reign (more doom than glitter) and a true-crime history about a high-society jewel thief.
