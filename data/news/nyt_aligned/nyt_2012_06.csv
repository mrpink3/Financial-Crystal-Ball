Restaurant meals present a small battle every time, because while the other children may or may not choose soda, and may or may not finish it, this child chooses soda every single time and drains the cup (often before dinner is served) every time as well. The battle? She wants to be served in a “big kid cup” because she says, rightly, that she never spills (in part because her grip on the cup resembles that of Gollum on the ring). I insist on a “baby cup,” not because of the lid, but because of the size: just the right amount of soda for someone of her small stature.

In May, the province introduced an emergency law intended to limit protests, a measure that many human rights lawyers have criticized as excessive. More than 2,500 people have been arrested since students at colleges and universities in Quebec began their strike.

The retired officer, Col. Vladimir Lazar, was charged with espionage for selling what officials said were classified topographical maps to a man they said was a Pentagon agent. Prosecutors said Colonel Lazar bought computer disks containing 7,000 maps, then smuggled them into Belarus and passed them to Alexander Lesment, a Russian émigré they identified as an agent for the United States. Marina Gridneva, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor, said the disks contained state secrets that “could inflict real damage on the domestic security of Russia, allowing the planning of possible military actions.” Colonel Lazar will be stripped of his rank and confined to a high-security prison, according to the Federal Security Service.

Afridi was denied legal representation. He was tried under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, a draconian code governing Pakistan’s tribal areas but not Abbottabad, where he was operating.

2012-06-01,Once Upon a Time in Italy,"WHEN film critics and historians refer to the spaghetti western, they tend to mean four films directed by Sergio Leone: his “Dollars” trilogy with Clint Eastwood, and his epic, “Once Upon a Time in the West.” This focus on Leone’s work is understandable: he was a great filmmaker who made Mr. Eastwood a star. And it also acknowledges Akira Kurosawa, the form’s spiritual godfather, whose film “Yojimbo” inspired Leone and his colleagues to see westerns as cynical samurai films. But the spotlight on one director has tended to obscure the rest of the Italian western subgenre, which may include as many as 500 films.

2012-06-01,Up Front,"In his review of “The One,” RJ Smith’s biography of James Brown, the Rev. Al Sharpton describes himself as having been “like a son” to the Godfather of Soul. “I grew up part of my life in Queens,” Sharpton said in a telephone interview, “and all the kids would look over the back fence when he had a mansion in St. Albans.” Brown and Sharpton met years later at various events, but it was in 1973, backstage at Newark Symphony Hall, when they truly first connected. Brown’s son Teddy had recently died, and Sharpton’s father had walked out on the family when he was still a boy. “I became a replacement for Teddy,” Sharpton said, while Brown “became the father I lost. The only memories I have of doing things with my father are going to the Apollo to see James Brown.” In 1982, Brown and Sharpton flew to Washington to lobby President Ronald Reagan on behalf of a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. On the way there, Brown said: “Do me a favor. I want you to style your hair like mine.” By the time they reached Washington, Sharpton recalled, “I had my hair styled like his,” and he promised to keep it like that for as long as Brown was alive.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/up-front.html

2012-06-01,Say It Loud,"When James Brown’s children and I brought his body back to Harlem from Georgia after his untimely death in 2006, tens of thousands greeted us in the streets upon our arrival. There were no stars, no concerts; just everyday folks paying homage to the Godfather of Soul (and so much more) in person. As we laid him in state at the Apollo Thea­ter, we took a moment to absorb this extraordinary show of support. I remember walking the streets of Harlem and shaking hands with many gathered outside the Apollo that day, and I’ll never forget a writer who came up to me and said he was shocked by the sheer numbers of people, and taken aback by how much of a revered figure James Brown was. People were often surprised at his relevance, but James never doubted his own significance, or the fact that he was a historic figure and an undeniably game-changing artist. His showmanship and art altered the music world. But James didn’t bring blacks to the mainstream; instead, he brought the mainstream to blacks and made them appreciate and internalize black music and culture themselves. “The One: The Life and Music of James Brown,” by RJ Smith, is the first book to capture this remarkable reality.

But the city, truth be told, saw no reason to celebrate. An unimaginable tragedy had just occurred at sea, turning the birth of Fenway Park into a sour afterthought.

Over the past few years, he’s documented his tenures in Pyongyang, Shenzhen and Burma (now Myanmar). Like the books that resulted from those trips, JERUSALEM: Chronicles From the Holy City (Drawn & Quarterly, $24.95) isn’t exactly reportage. It’s a series of brief strips, many only a page or two long, depicting his experiences caring for his kids, seeking opportunities to draw local landmarks without being interrupted by soldiers, and trying to comprehend how the residents of a heavily contested territory live day to day. Delisle, a former animator, has a knack for visual shorthand (his self-­portrait is a few jauntily canted lines with dots for eyes) and for drawing environments: religious shrines and settlements, but also grocery stores, playgrounds and checkpoints — lots of checkpoints. The cultural and physical barriers among the Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities in and around Jerusalem, and the compromises and work-arounds the city’s residents have been forced to devise, become the source of dark but gentle comedy: absurdity teetering on the edge of tragedy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/jerusalem-by-guy-delisle-and-more.html

In our short-­attention-span era, we’re both inspired and intrigued by the athletes’ intense discipline and singular focus. The dark side of the gymnasium holds its own fascination, of course.

2012-06-01,Inside the List,"NOT LUCKY: Last year, Justin Halpern spent 40 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list with his first book, “_ My Dad Says,” a memoir that grew out of Halpern’s Twitter feed after his girlfriend dumped him and he moved back in with his mother and his feisty 73-year-old father. (The book also inspired a short-lived TV series starring William Shatner.) Looking back on that success in a new memoir, “I Suck at Girls” — it’s at No. 6 on the e-book nonfiction list — Halpern is mostly baffled and grateful. “What began as an attempt to take my mind off my heartache, and make a couple friends laugh, exploded,” he writes. “Within two months I had more than half a million followers, a book deal with a major publisher and a TV deal, which is all the more ridiculous when you take into account that it was solely because I was just writing down things my dad said. They weren’t even my words. To say I was ‘lucky’ would be inaccurate. Finding your wallet after you’ve left it in a crowded bar is lucky. Getting a book deal and a TV show based on less than 500 total words is a level of luck reserved for people who survive plane crashes or find out they’re Oprah’s long-lost sister.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/inside-the-list.html

First, it pointed out Isner’s vulnerability against highly capable–but lower ranked–opponents in the first week of Grand Slams. Isner seems to feel much more pressure when he is the favorite, when expectations rise and he is the hunted rather than the hunter. His two signature wins of 2012, over Roger Federer in the Davis Cup tie in February, and against Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of Indian Wells, were remarkable in the way Isner carried himself with confidence and a warrior’s mentality. He played to win, and wasn’t afraid to take intelligent risks to seize the upper hand against two of the game’s greats.

Kraft, the Canadian-born founder of Kraft Foods, lay not in artisanal cheesemaking but in taking a milk-based product and making it long-lasting, consistent in quality and easy to slice. In 1916, after a series of experiments at his Chicago boardinghouse, the former grocery clerk received a patent for “process cheese”: a sterilized product made by heating Cheddar at 175 degrees for 15 minutes while whisking it continuously. The invention helped turn cheese into a shippable commodity with a longer shelf life — and transform Kraft’s company into a cheese empire. James’s brother Norman, who became Kraft’s head of research, wanted to make things even easier for the consumer by precutting the cheese into slices. The idea was easier to conceive than to execute: process cheese was packaged and sealed while still fluid and hot, and cutting hot cheese was like trying to slice molten lava.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/magazine/who-made-that-kraft-single.html

2012-06-01,When ‘Dallas’ Was the Capital of America,"In the 1980s, there were two competing visions of wealth on TV: “Dallas” and “Dynasty.” People tend to lump the two nighttime soaps together, but aside from the characters’ habit of resolving major conflicts in the swimming pool, the two shows couldn’t be more different. “Dynasty” constructed a fantasy of domestic royalty and jet-setting escapism, offering a portrait of the rich as diamond-strewn, evening-gown-clad ghosts drifting from their private jets to their enormous mansions as servants rushed about carrying silver platters. “Dallas,” by contrast, stayed firmly rooted in middle-class American values, presenting a picture that was more Big Boy breakfast buffet than “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” With its cowboy hats and flocked wallpaper and Hatfields-versus-McCoys-style feuds, “Dallas” was as provincial and preglobal-economy as it gets. Even Southfork’s décor, with its dark paneling, garish paintings and low ceilings, mirrored the claustrophobia of the country club: cramped, wall-to-wall carpeted spaces packed with small-minded people lugging their gigantic egos around behind them like overstuffed golf bags.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/magazine/when-dallas-was-the-capital-of-america.html

The prevalence of the electronic sound often made it seem banal, but it had brawnier, moodier ancestors. One pioneer was the German rock band Tangerine Dream, which formed in 1967 and broke through in the 1970s with a sound marked by expansive synthesized washes and percussive chords.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/movies/tangerine-dreams-music-in-bamcinematek-series.html

2012-06-04,Lindsay Lohan’s New Wave,"In “First Point,” his new short film, the artist Richard Phillips combines two of his current obsessions: surfing and Lindsay Lohan. Phillips has worked with the actress and tabloid goddess before, on a 90-second video for Neville Wakefield’s “Commercial Break,” which had a very brief run during the 54th Venice Biennale. And his studio is lined with several larger-than-life paintings of Lohan that came directly out of that particular project. But don’t call Lohan his muse. Lohan, Phillips insists, is his collaborator as much as anyone in the stellar cast of people who worked on the film, including the legendary surf filmmaker Taylor Steele; the professional surfer Kassia Meador, who performs mesmerizingly as Lohan’s body double; the editor Jay Rabinowitz; and Thomas Bangalter, one half of the electro duo Daft Punk, who composed the ominously swelling score. As the trailer implies, “First Point” is at once a surf film and a film noir, an exploration of the California dream and the Hollywood nightmare, worlds that Lohan doesn’t have to pretend to straddle on screen. But no doubt the question on everyone’s lips when “First Point” has its premiere next week at Art Unlimited, the curated section of the Art Basel fair, will be: “Is it art?” And that is just fine by Phillips. “It’s just like in my paintings,” he says. “Because of the actor and the popular culture dimensions of the project, it will give people — especially people in the art world — a real sense of instability with regard to my intentions. Is it a film? Is it an art video? It refuses to announce itself as either.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/lindsay-lohans-new-wave/

There, industry members gathered to commemorate the organization’s 50th anniversary, to recognize the year’s most exciting contributions to fashion design and journalism, and to celebrate the lifetime achievements of some of the business’s biggest creative influences. Kicking off the evening’s ceremony was this short film, “50 Years of the CFDA,” directed by Zoe Cassavetes and inspired by Richard Avedon’s 1969 portraits of Andy Warhol and members of the Factory. “I think it came out as half film, half art collage,” noted Cassavetes about the project. Of her subjects she said: “I was pretty blown away by the talent that came through the studio during those two days [we were shooting]. It was interesting to see which designers are inspired by others and why. It’s not just about the clothes they make … it’s about the universe they create.” Below is a list of this year’s award winners and honorees:",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/now-playing-fifty-years-of-the-cfda/

2012-06-05,"Big Government, Small Families","Last week I had the pleasure of joining the Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne on “The Diane Rehm Show” for a discussion of his engaging new book, “Our Divided Political Heart,” which is both a meditation on the individualistic and communitarian strands in American political thought and history, and (as you might expect, given the author) a lament that the contemporary Republican Party has tilted the contemporary balance dangerously toward a radical individualism. My main criticism of his thesis (also perhaps predictably) was to question Dionne’s tendency to equate “community” with “government,” given the way expansions of state power tend to crowd out more personal and/or voluntary forms of common life (civic, religious, familial), replacing human-scale interactions with bureaucratic process and leaving society more atomized than before. To which he responded that while this can happen, it doesn’t have to happen: Government can strengthen local communities as well as weaken them, partner with private groups as well pre-empt them, and fill in the gaps left by purely voluntary effort as well as take those efforts’ place. Conceding that reality, I nonetheless tried to press Dionne a bit more on whether given where we are now, with a large-scale and costly welfare state having become a permanent feature of our national life even as more local and personal forms of community have attenuated, the conservative-communitarian suspicion of state power might not be more relevant than the liberal-communitarian view of the state as an instrument of social solidarity.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/big-government-small-families/

Inmates released from prison in 2009 spent an average of 2.9 years — or 36 percent — longer behind bars than offenders released in 1990, the report found. The additional time cost taxpayers more than $10 billion. In Florida, the average time served rose by 166 percent; in New York, 2 percent. Eight states showed decreases in the length of prison terms, according to the report, which analyzed data from the federal government’s National Corrections Reporting Program. Adam Gelb, director of the center’s Public Safety Performance Project, noted that the variation among states followed no evident regional pattern, reinforcing the idea that “state policy choices, often driven by particular crimes or circumstances in that state, drive the size and cost of the prison population, rather than data and research about what’s most effective in reducing crime.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/average-prison-stay-grew-36-percent-in-two-decades.html

BP sought the e-mails from the scientists, Chris Reddy and Richard Camilli of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, to help prepare its defense in a lawsuit brought by the federal government. In an op-ed article in The Boston Globe, the scientists said they had given the company more than 50,000 pages of documents and data before the company also demanded the e-mails. They said they worried that BP would use the e-mails to falsely cast doubt on their conclusions. “Our concern is not simply invasion of privacy, but the erosion of the scientific deliberative process,” the scientists wrote. BP said the subpoena was “in no way an attack on science.” ",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/science/earth/louisiana-two-scientists-surrender-e-mail-to-bp.html

But beginning Sept. 30, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Wednesday, most borrowers will be able to electronically import data directly from the Internal Revenue Service onto their application, letting them complete the application at one sitting, without going through their loan servicer. Mr. Duncan said the new process could avert “a significant percentage of defaults.” ",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/education/obama-seeks-to-clear-loan-repayment-roadblocks.html

2012-06-07,China: Foreigners Barred in Tibet," Several travel agencies in China said Wednesday that foreigners were banned from traveling to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Chinese name for central Tibet, for at least June. The agencies said they had been told of the ban recently. One agency said the ban was expected to last until September, while another said there was a chance the ban could be lifted by July. In late May, two Tibetans set themselves on fire in front of the Jokhang, the holiest temple of Tibetan Buddhism, in the center of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, to protest Chinese rule. One man died. Those self-immolations were among at least 38 that have taken place in Tibetan regions since 2009. Foreigners were barred from Tibet from late February to early April, a period that coincided with the anniversary of large protests against Chinese rule.

And at the very least, ethicists and engineers will have to get used to the idea of working closely together. The article also suggests it will be necessary “to determine whether the designer, the programmer, the manufacturer or the operator is at fault” if something goes wrong. But if responsibility can ultimately be assigned to a human being, its unclear why we would need to scrap the good old fashioned moral system we already have in place.

That seems to be the driving ambition at the English company whose heritage rests on the shoulders of a single piece of outerwear, the Trialmaster racing jacket. But the designer Martin Cooper (who happens to be a Burberry alum) has already gone a considerable distance with the brand in a short time. Using the crosshatch pattern on the original jacket’s hardware as a leitmotif, Cooper turned out a resort collection full of clever riffs on the Trialmaster — as a snappy linen jacket, say, or a fitted dress — that will get fashion motors running without any trouble at all.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/just-one-look-belstaff-2/

The authorities later identified the man as Giovanni Vantaggiato. Because the school was dedicated to Francesca Morvillo, who was killed with her husband, Giovanni Falcone, a prosecutor, by a Mafia bomb 20 years ago, investigators had initially investigated links to organized crime. The prosecutor Cataldo Motta said the suspect had admitted to having “economic problems,” but could not explain how that might have prompted him to carry out what Mr. Motta called a terrorist act. “He did not explain, he did not give justifications,” he said.

2012-06-08,He’s a Rainbow | Hiroshi Sugimoto for Hermès,"“Light is my medium to be investigated,” says the Japanese artist Hiroshi Sugimoto, who spent years chasing bands of prismatic color around his studio in Tokyo and capturing them, with what was for him rapid-fire succession, using a Polaroid camera. In collaboration with Hermès, 20 of the artist’s abstract color studies have been translated into silk scarves in signed, limited editions of seven each. “Couleurs de L’Ombre” (Colors of Shadow), as the collection is called, is a moving tribute to the lowly Polaroid, which faces imminent extinction. (Sugimoto in fact exhausted his last batch of the film to make the images.) Hermès, on the other hand, developed new inkjet technology in order to faithfully recreate the subtle gradations of intense color. Where the original Polaroids are small and precious, the scarves are large — just over 55 inches square — and dynamic, playing with light in ways the artist had never anticipated. Though at around $10,000, you might think twice about actually wearing one. “It’s serious art for me,” Sugimoto says, with a nod to Hermès. “And if it’s serious art, for me, it’s also very reasonably priced.” Available at hermes-editeur.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/hes-a-rainbow-hiroshi-sugimoto-for-hermes/

After her husband, John Gregory Dunne, died suddenly of a heart attack in 2003, Didion made out of her bereavement a remarkable memoir, “The Year of Magical Thinking.” “Blue Nights,” a luminous companion volume, traces the author’s efforts to come to terms with a second calamity: the death of her daughter, Quintana Roo, in 2005 at age 39. Moving between recent painful memories and bright family snapshots, Didion’s elegy also becomes a meditation on the passage of time.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/paperback-row.html

2012-06-08,Quinoa Salads With Spring Vegetables,"I’m always tweaking the way I cook quinoa, and this week I changed my method for basic quinoa. I’d been cooking it sort of like pasta, in 3 parts water, then draining it and letting it dry out in a towel-covered pan. Ordinarily, this is a good way to obtain very fluffy grains, and you get a lot of volume too. But lately I’ve been finding that my quinoa is soggy – more waterlogged than fluffy – when I cook it this way, even after it rests under the towel. Are the grains different? I don’t know. Whatever the reason, I decided to change the grain-to-water ratio and followed the directions on my Alter Eco quinoa packages (Alter Eco is a company dedicated to fair-trade foods, and they import red, rainbow and pearl quinoas). I cooked the pearl and the red quinoas in 1 1/2 parts water and the rainbow in 2 parts water. The black quinoa in the rainbow mix takes a little longer to soften and requires a little more liquid to be properly hydrated. The grains were tighter and less moist than quinoa cooked in abundant water, and the yield was not as great because the grains don’t swell as much. But I liked the results, especially for salads, which were the destination for my quinoa experiments.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/health/nutrition/quinoa-and-asparagus-salad.html

2012-06-08,Inside the List,"MAN’S WORLD: The cutoff for this week’s list was June 2 — too early, you’d think, to reflect any kind of Father’s Day sales bump. Yet with subjects including the Civil War, international espionage, Navy SEALs and the most trusted man in America, the list’s new titles throw off a decidedly masculine funk. The Civil War book is Jeff Shaara’s “Blaze of Glory,” a novel about the Battle of Shiloh that hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 and contains one character as notable to literary historians as military ones: the Union general Lew Wallace. Blamed for the battle’s heavy casualties after he was late with reinforcements, Wallace went on to serve as governor of the New Mexico Territory before becoming, like Shaara, a wildly popular historical novelist. (His “Ben-Hur,” published in 1880, was the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, and has never gone out of print.) Shaara, a former coin dealer who started writing after the death of his novelist father, told a Florida newspaper recently that he tries to grab his audiences right away: “A very good friend of mine who is not especially a reader said to me, ‘If you expect me to read your books, you’ve gotta hook me in Chapter 1.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies (commonly known as the East India Company) and its counterpart, the Dutch East India Company, fielded their own warships and armies, coined money and ruled territory eventually taken over by Britain and the Netherlands.

A longtime faculty member at Columbia, he is devoted to the development of his students as individuals, and recognizes that their time in college should be formative: “They may still be deterred from sheer self-interest toward a life of enlarged sympathy and civic responsibility.” Like most professors devoted to teaching, he has no interest in telling undergraduates what to think, but he does want to draw them toward a sense of skepticism about the status quo and to a feeling of wonder about the natural world. College, he tells us, is a time to learn to “make connections among seemingly disparate phenomena,” to see things from another’s point of view and to develop a sense of ethical responsibility. At a time when many are trying to reduce the college years to a training period for economic competition, Delbanco reminds readers of the ideal of democratic education.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/college-by-andrew-delbanco.html

Of course most of those who suffered directly are dead or otherwise incapacitated, and few indirect sufferers have been sufficiently talented. We do have marvelous books by Primo Levi; “Fatelessness,” by Imre Kertesz (who dismissed the film “Schindler’s List” as kitsch); Solzhenitsyn’s “Gulag Archipelago”; and perhaps Wiesel’s “Night,” but it’s a small list.

Her charge is Louise Brooks, soon-to-be silent-film star and something of a force of nature. As the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, Brooks was “a creature of impulse, a creator of impulses, a temptress with no pretensions, capable of dissolving into a giggling fit at a peak of erotic ecstasy, . . . with that sleek jet cloche of hair that rings such a peal of bells in my subconscious.” Moriarty’s Louise is only 15, a Jazz Age lost girl playing uncertainty as brashness, but impulse and temptation are already in bloom.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/the-chaperone-by-laura-moriarty.html

2012-06-08,Uncertain Times,"In his eloquent essay “The Great Christmas Killing,” the Hungarian novelist Peter Nadas describes his intense, ultimately chagrined response to a documentary about the execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu. Neither his opposition to capital punishment nor his belief in the importance of “just, legal procedures” keeps Nadas from feeling a surge of vengeful delight as he witnesses the final hours of the Romanian dictator. “Ceausescu just kept looking at his wife, rolling his small, shifty eyes and grinning nervously; you could tell he couldn’t grasp what was really happening or figure out how he might gain the upper hand.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/books/review/the-last-hundred-days-by-patrick-mcguinness.html

It picks up some dangling threads, brings Robin into the fight for justice and introduces the Hangman, another serial killer. These early looks into the careers of heroes have become something of a trademark for Mr. Loeb and Mr. Sale.

For its premiere at the Joyce Theater on Friday night, what lingered from that initial impulse were the ideas of effort and resilience, both spiritual and physical. Members of Ms. Miller’s Gallim Dance compressed or stretched their bodies to extremes, returned to form and started all over again. Presented in conjunction with the Gotham Dance Festival that concluded over the weekend, the production did offer a glimpse into a new direction for Ms. Miller, whose dances, up to this point, have been energetic but unoriginal. They take much from Gaga, a movement practice created by the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin. There are traces of Gaga in “Sit, Kneel, Stand” but, encouragingly, the performance is more than a Gaga class.

The background to the study is the striking fact that even as traditional marriage has declined in the United States – marriage rates tumbling, out-of-wedlock childbirth climbing, and cohabitation becoming as respectable as wedlock – the evidence has mounted for the institution’s importance to the well-being of children. A happy childhood is possible in many different environments, of course. But a growing body of research indicates that no other parental arrangement, from single motherhood to cohabitation to shared custody, affords as many social, economic and emotional advantages as being raised by two biological parents joined in a lifelong commitment. (Isabel Sawhill from the Brookings Institution and Kay Hymowitz from the Manhattan Institute have both had good recent pieces elaborating on some of these themes.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/gay-parents-and-the-marriage-debate/

2012-06-12,The Get | Perrin’s Attelage Minaudière,"The specialty leather-goods brand Perrin Paris is probably foreign territory to even the most seasoned Madison Avenue shopper. But there’s nothing low profile about Perrin. After nearly 12 decades of being available exclusively in France, and more recently in Beverly Hills, Calif., the Parisian fashion house has opened shop in New York City’s Carlyle Hotel (987 Madison Avenue). The house is known for glove making, sunglasses and handbags, and is a favorite among high-profilers like Beyoncé (a fan of the Menotte Clutch), P. Diddy (Cabriolet driving gloves) and Martha Stewart (who helped design the company’s jet-set travel pouch). “Often, American women look for practicality in a bag whereas les Francaises understand it is more about the image and the completion of a look,” says Sally Perrin, the creative director of the fourth-generation-run business. “We bridge the past with the present by creating witty and unique designs.” The Attelage Minaudière is a perfect example: a classic ladylike purse by all accounts but made new in a novel itsy-bitsy size. “It’s a wrist ornament,” Perrin says, noting that the bag is available in goatskin, crocodile, lambskin, shagreen and, come fall, lacquered wood. “It’s an accessory in every sense of the word.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/the-get-perrins-attelage-minaudiere/

2012-06-12,Artisanal Threads | Graymarket in Williamsburg,"Williamsburg is already recognized as a center of artisanal pickle, jam and cheese production. With the recent opening of Graymarket, a by-appointment-only boutique-cum-gallery dedicated to dead-stock clothing made by designers like Paul Harnden, Carpe Diem, Carol Christian Poell and Katie Gallagher, it’s time to add artisanal clothing to that list. The Graymarket founders, Wei Du and Alex Kasavin, met online, where artisanal clothing fans buy, trade and spend many, many characters analyzing the provenance and lineage of their limited-edition obsessions. “Buttonholes, stitching, dye lots — these kind of things are taken very seriously,” Du says. “People try to find out exactly what tannery the leather in a jacket comes from.” Many artisanal clothing designers work in black, the better to emphasize the tailoring and technique that goes into each garment, and that’s reflected in the goth cast of many of the clothes on Graymarket’s racks. But Due and Kasavin stress that they’re not purists, a stance they’ve underlined both in the tongue-in-cheek name they gave their shop — it’s a reference to goods being traded legally but not via the distribution channels intended by their manufacturers — and in the stock they carry, which includes the work of both small-scale, cult studios and boldface names like Balenciaga, Givenchy and Alaïa, designers that not all artisanal enthusiasts would accept as legit. “We don’t want to be about labels,” Kasavin says. “To us, it’s about technique and narrative, not about limiting what we can sell. We take something glam, like a jacket by Givenchy, and hang it next to something with a more street feel. We want to open up the possibilities.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/artisanal-threads-graymarket-in-williamsburg/

The shop delivers a major upgrade to the retail offerings at the airport; it’s stocked with beauty products, jewelry and accessories for men and women, stationery and children’s toys and gifts, all by a roster of innovative designers and manufacturers. “Our first sale, at 4:30 in the morning while we were still setting up the space, was a $60 John Derian paperweight,” says Jesse James, the founder and creative director of Aesthetic Movement, the company that was hired to merchandise and brand the store. (It is run by the airport retailer A.E.I. Retail.) Prices range from $4.99 for Hurraw! Lip balms to $100 for a handmade necktie by Forage to $150 for a Thomaspaul wool shawl, and top out at $425 for a pearl and pyrite necklace by Carolina. Besides carrying items a traveler would expect, like a stylish toothbrush, James said it was important to “bring in a few things that made no sense, like a gold leather Webster’s dictionary or Harry Allen’s gold pig bank — things that are interesting and lovely, but we thought, honestly, Who will buy this in an airport?” Plenty of people, apparently.

The other recipe was adapted by Mr. Wondrich from one by the 19th-century bartender Jerry Thomas.

2012-06-13,Stone Links: Addiction and Agency,"This week The Stone featured an essay by Peg O’Connor on addiction, the brain and the will. Philosophy Now has more on the topic. Addictive actions are often thought to undermine the will. But can we think of them more simply as representing nothing more than capricious changes of mind? There is a view of temptation and the will, tracing back to Plato’s “Protagoras,” that takes them to be just that. It is an elegant theory, as it makes no use of the thorny notion of akrasia, or weakness of will. Alan Brody argues at Philosophy Now, though, that we can find another view in Plato that also refuses the concept of akrasia while still respecting the way addiction disrupts agency, in particular our capacity to regulate our actions. The view is this: when one acts on an addictive impulse, one’s will remains intact. It is, rather, the capacity to judge what is the best course of action that fails one; the addictive course momentarily appears to be the best available.What Rorty Wrought: Santiago Zabala marks the five year anniversary of Richard Rorty’s passing with this tribute in Al-Jazeera. Rorty ought to be the model for 21st century philosophy, Zabala argues, owing to his eclectic approach to philosophical method and the capacity it gave him to transcend narrow debates within Anglo-American philosophy and see the way philosophy might figure productively in the broader intellectual and political life of America and Europe. But politics should also inform philosophy: “If you take care of freedom,” Rorty says, “truth will take care of itself.” For Rorty, truth ought to be conceived not as correspondence to a mind-independent reality, but pragmatically, as consisting in those conclusions an open and free community might arrive at in the long run of inquiry.

The man, Louis ReVille, 32, who was arrested in October after an investigation revealed he molested more than 20 children he taught and coached in the Charleston area, apologized to his victims. Some are suing the institutions that hired him, including The Citadel, a military college. Victims have claimed that The Citadel knew Mr. ReVille molested teenagers at a camp in 2002, luring boys into his room with the promise of pizza and Chinese food and then showing them pornography and encouraging group masturbation sessions. The college, which investigated the complaint but did not report it to police, apologized.

He had testified last Thursday from the United States Interest Section in Havana on the short-term detention of dissidents. Mr. García Pérez still faces charges, including “spreading false information,” senators Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Marco Rubio of Florida, both Cuban-Americans, said in a statement. The Cuban government has not responded, but generally treats dissidents as common criminals in the pay of the American government and exile groups. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/world/americas/cuba-senators-condemn-treatment-of-cuban-dissident.html

It depends on how and where they spend it. If you’re reading my words, it’s likely that your children have access to reading materials at home. Children who don’t read over the summer lose two to three months of reading development while children who do gain a month — but research shows that children surrounded by reading material don’t appear to be at much risk. Summer reading is as effective as summer school, and it doesn’t matter what children read, as long as the reading is happening.

Tomorrow, the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society on Long Island will unveil “A Bellport Tale,” a new exhibit of photos that Weber took when he resided in Bellport in the 1970s and ’80s. “Everyone knew each other,” Weber said of the quaint bayside village. “You could knock on any door and just invite a neighbor over to be part of a photography sitting. It was as easy as borrowing a cup of sugar.” The images in the exhibit come from a shoot that appeared in British Vogue in 1982 called “Under Weston Eyes.” Starring Talisa Soto and the male model of the moment, Bruce Hulse, that story was styled by Grace Coddington and inspired by the work of another photographer, Edward Weston. “He took things that were very personal to him and let us see into that world,” Weber said. “I thought it would be interesting to do a series of pictures of my own imaginary family, living together in the dysfunctional, neurotic, beautiful way that families do.” The exhibit (on view through Sept. 3) includes many memorable images, but perhaps none is more evocative of a quiet life on the bay than that of a shirtless Hulse, sitting on the stern of a boat, cigarette in hand, wearing calf-revealing baggy trousers, rumpled socks and dress shoes.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/bruces-bellport/

Now, for Ruiz de la Prada’s second exclusive collection for Yoox.com, she has created 30 one-of-a-kind fascinators (priced from $90 to $105).

2012-06-14,Ooh La La Maison | Paul & Joe Comes Home,"Sophie Albou-Mechaly, the designer for the French clothing label Paul & Joe, doesn’t claim to be an avid chef, but delights in collecting china — from the high-end Hungarian manufacturer Herend to kitsch treasures like Ridgewood — at the Paris flea markets. “I love to dress a dinner table in colorful prints the way I dress myself,” says Albou-Mechaly, who is now expanding the brand to include home goods. “My idea of fashion is not to be only about clothes but about living well.” Paul & Joe La Maison is making its first foray into design with a three-print collection of kitchenware: cherry blossoms, kittens and Asian-inspired koi motifs. “The brand’s DNA is all about the happiness in colors and prints, so this feels like a natural extension,” she says, which is another way of saying that La Maison’s prints are derived from the current season and past collection hit makers. “As a woman and a mother, I am constantly thinking about women and the clothes and things that they need in their lives: practicality and appeal,” she adds. The collection includes everything from porcelain dinner plates and linen dishcloths to butter dishes, egg cups and even charming lunch boxes. And, with everything priced between $30 and $150 (similar to its sold-out 2006 Target collaboration), customers can afford the luxury of changing their home décor as often as they change their mood and clothes. “There’s no trend to it,” Albou-Mechaly says. “Mixing pieces and decorating your kitchen with them is fun.” The designer also suggests swapping tired hostess gifts (wine, flowers, desserts) with a La Maison item, since each piece comes beautifully packaged in a matching print box. Aren’t American kitchens’ needs different from those of French kitchens’? Albou-Mechaly begs to differ: “We are the American kitchen, English kitchen, French kitchen, Italian kitchen — it’s just the taste that is different.” Expect La Maison to take over every inch of your home, maison, flat or casa.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/ooh-la-la-maison-paul-joe-comes-home/

The proposal was made during a meeting between Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the Society of St. Pius X, and Cardinal William J. Levada, the Vatican’s chief doctrinal officer, to discuss elements of the “doctrinal preamble” that the group must accept before reconciliation can be reached. Bishop Fellay promised to respond in a “reasonable” amount of time. The group does not have canonical status in the church. In 1988 Pope John Paul II excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the group’s founder, as well as four bishops he consecrated without the Vatican’s approval.

2012-06-15,Cocaine Incorporated,"One afternoon last August, at a hospital on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a former beauty queen named Emma Coronel gave birth to a pair of heiresses. The twins, who were delivered at 3:50 and 3:51, respectively, stand to inherit some share of a fortune that Forbes estimates is worth a billion dollars. Coronel’s husband, who was not present for the birth, is a legendary tycoon who overcame a penurious rural childhood to establish a wildly successful multinational business. If Coronel elected to leave the entry for “Father” on the birth certificates blank, it was not because of any dispute over patrimony. More likely, she was just skittish about the fact that her husband, Joaquín Guzmán, is the C.E.O. of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, a man the Treasury Department recently described as the world’s most powerful drug trafficker. Guzmán’s organization is responsible for as much as half of the illegal narcotics imported into the United States from Mexico each year; he may well be the most-wanted criminal in this post-Bin Laden world. But his bride is a U.S. citizen with no charges against her.

Part of Project1Voice’s second annual event 1 Voice, 1 Play, 1 Day, the reading was chosen to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Baldwin’s death. Set in Harlem in the 1950s, “The Amen Corner,” like Baldwin’s first novel, “Go Tell It on the Mountain,” explores the role Christianity plays in the lives of African-Americans. The New York reading, which will be performed on Monday at 7 p.m at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, is to be hosted by Norm Lewis (below, of “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess”) and directed by Walter Dallas with Lillias White, Chuck Cooper and Adriane Lenox starring. Speaking in a telephone interview, the Project1Voice founder Erich McMillan-McCall said that the goal of the annual reading was to help “preserve the legacy and tradition of black theaters for future generations,” adding, “By creating awareness and reigniting what I call lesser-known classics by African-American playwrights we can get people to realize that there is a voice that is missing, and that is the voice of many minority professionals.” Tickets are available through (631) 464-7421 or project1voice.org.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/theater/a-baldwin-play-reading-will-benefit-theaters.html

2012-06-18,A Bet on the Sun,"Out in the Mojave Desert in California, a power plant that could eventually generate enough electricity for 140,000 homes hopes to get its moment in the sun soon. When the $2.2 billion solar thermal plant known as Ivanpah is completed — sometime next year, if all goes according to plan — nearly 350,000 mirrors on 3,600 acres will reflect light onto boilers. Steam will power turbines, which will generate electricity that flows to California homes. It will be the largest such plant in the world. These “solar workhorses of the desert,” says V. John White, an analyst in Sacramento and an advocate for renewable energy, “can produce a lot of high-quality energy in the way that other renewable energies can’t do. And there are only a handful of places on the planet that have solar radiation that good.” But some opponents have criticized the Obama administration for pushing solar projects that don’t pan out. The solar-panel maker Solyndra declared bankruptcy last year despite receiving $528 million in federally guaranteed loans, while BrightSource Energy, one of Ivanpah’s developers, has benefited from a similar $1.6 billion government loan. It’s expensive harnessing the sun. And the costs go beyond construction. BrightSource says that it has spent more than $56 million relocating desert tortoises.

The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that 4.3 million people in all were newly displaced last year, which includes those who stayed in their countries and those who fled. At the end of 2011, the report said, 42.5 million people were either refugees (15.2 million), internally displaced (26.4 million) or in the process of seeking asylum (895,000). The overall total was lower than the 2010 total of 43.7 million mainly because 3.2 million internally displaced people returned home, the report said. The number of people who fled their countries and became refugees last year was the highest in that category since 822,000 in 2000.

2012-06-19,Iraq: Bomber Attacks Funeral," A man wearing an explosives belt detonated it amid a group of Shiite mourners at a funeral in Diyala Province on Monday, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 40, according to security officials. The attack came after days of strikes against mostly Shiite targets in a stepped-up campaign of sectarian violence carried out by the Sunni insurgent group Al Qaeda in Iraq. Over the past week nearly 150 Iraqis have been killed in attacks. Violence, largely sectarian in nature, has substantially increased after a period of relative calm following the withdrawal of the American military in December. The rising violence coincides with a political struggle involving Iraq’s three main factions — the Shiite majority, which controls the government, and the minority Kurds and Sunnis, who have called for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.

The astronauts will live and work in the module for several days as part of preparations for a permanent space station.

In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control. Monday’s docking also was completed by remote control from a ground base in China. A manual docking, to be carried out by one of the crew members, is scheduled for later in the mission.

(“Fortunately for you, though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had some bad luck, and you had some good luck.”) It was a modest story of a brother and sister whose parents die when they’re kids and whose lives are blown in different directions and who, years later, come to some almost-peace about what they can and can’t be for each other. But there was such intense realness about it, the way people really talk, the way lives are actually lived, that was unlike anything else on screen, radical almost, in its attention to the genuine messiness of human lives.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/magazine/kenneth-lonergans-thwarted-masterpiece.html

While the spokesman, Clint Bond Jr., said any talk of a Broadway move for “Pippin” was premature, such a transfer would become a possibility if the Weisslers, who have produced musical revivals like the long-running “Chicago,” come on board and the show draws strong reviews in Cambridge, where it is scheduled to run Dec. 5-Jan. 20, 2013.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/diane-paulus-pippin-may-get-broadway-backers/

2012-06-20,Florida: State Is Sued Again Over Voter Purge ," A second lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami on Tuesday against the State of Florida over its search of voter rolls for noncitizens. Several civil and voters’ rights groups joined in the suit, which says the search violates the National Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act. The groups said the review discriminates against minorities and is prohibited within 90 days of an election. Florida has a primary in August. The state is also being sued by the Department of Justice. Earlier this year, the state sent names of 2,700 possible noncitizens to county election supervisors, who were advised to write those people, asking them to offer proof of citizenship or risk being dropped from the rolls. But the list, compiled by comparing voter rolls to a driver’s license databank and overwhelmingly singled out minorities, was found to be flawed. The state has asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow it to use an immigration database to verify the list, but the federal government has not done so. As a result, Florida is suing Homeland Security over access to the database. The civil rights groups say they hope their suit deters other states from conducting similar searches.

Inspired by Katja Vogt, Pigliucci uses the Platonic concept of “transferred ignorance,” to distinguish between a healthy Socratic, “self-aware” kind of ignorance, and the kind of “willful ignorance” that allows “feelings” to “somehow trump actual scientific evidence,” as in the case of McCarthy’s campaign against childhood vaccination. Pigliucci argues, after Plato, that this latter type of ignorance can be “morally problematic,” and that its recent prevelance has led our political discourse into “never before achieved peaks (or, rather, valleys).”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/stone-links-the-ethics-of-ignorance-and-humor/
2012-06-21,She’s 350 Pounds and Olympics-Bound,"When you’re a big, strong girl — a really big, strong girl — it’s easier to pull the table to your chair than to scoot your chair toward the table. Doorknobs need to be tightened, or you might pull them off. Holley Mangold, 22 and a superheavyweight Olympic weight lifter, is 5-foot-8 and weighs 350 pounds. When she squats, which she can do with 525 pounds on her shoulders, she looks almost wholly like an egg. “I get a lot of Creepy McCreepersons interested in me because I’m so big it’s not normal, it’s like a fetish,” she told me one day in the gym. “And I don’t like to sit outside. Not because I don’t like to be outside, but usually there are plastic chairs.

But at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum-Wall Street, an annual conference organized by the American Council on Renewable Energy, the talk on Wednesday was of developing a different kind of carbon market where the gas would be bought and sold like a commodity to encourage carbon capture.",Science,https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/dreaming-up-a-whole-new-carbon-market/

2012-06-22,Banner Days,"His dashing ascot billowing, his flat cap perched just so (to hide his bald spot), the cleft-chinned Harry Hay had some impressive head shots. As a student at Stanford in the early 1930s, he had come out to his classmates as “temperamental,” code for “homosexual.” In 1934, having dropped out of Stanford and moved to Los Angeles to try a career in pictures — and having already begun to hone his identity as sensualist and agitator — he joined the Communist Party. Around 1936, he turned up at a Halloween party dressed as “the demise of fascism.” The other homosexual bons vivants were stumped: none were terribly turned on to politics, so none knew what Harry’s costume meant. These men, and others like them across America, had no core ideology, no political groups to join, no leaders. Hay changed that. In 1950, he helped create the Mattachine Society, the country’s first gay rights organization, and demanded that the people it represented “be respected for our differences, not for our sameness to heterosexuals.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/victory-by-linda-hirshman.html

This free festival, dedicated to video, interactive and performance art, is being held from 6 p.m. until midnight at the Atlantic Salt Company, which provides New York with road salt. This year’s mild winter meant the mounds didn’t budge. So Mr. Eamon and Melanie Cohn, executive director of the Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island, the festival’s sponsor, decided to use the 150,000 tons of salt as a canvas. The biggest mound will serve as a screen for projections — Marco Brambilla’s re-creation of the lunar landing, and a neon salt digger courtesy of a Brooklyn artist, Jeanne Verdoux, who made the cut in a local open call. The others will be surrounded by performances and site-specific installations. “We’re going to shape the salt in various formations and do something like a salt Zen garden,” Mr. Eamon said via Skype on Tuesday.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/arts/spare-times-for-june-22-29.html

2012-06-22,Paris Does Brooklyn,"Growing up in the Paris suburbs, David Obadia, 23, was obsessed with Nike Air Jordans and the American street-wear brands Supreme and Stussy. Meanwhile, his best friend, Nelson Hassan, 22, was more drawn to the avant-garde looks of Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. No wonder, then, that upon graduation from business school and fashion school, respectively, the duo started their own label, Brooklyn We Go Hard, named for the Jay-Z song. “We like everything about Brooklyn, including Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Dr. Brown’s soda and the Nets,” Obadia explains. (He assures that they’ve both been there several times.) “Brooklyn brings together the mainstream and the underground, which is what we want to do with the clothes.” They started in 2010 selling simple white T-shirts embossed with gritty images of New York taken by a handful of Paris photographers, but they gained steam last year when they introduced an elbow-padded sweatshirt (about $140), soft cotton on the inside and nubby wool on the outside, with the motto “Brooklyn Parle Français” embroidered across the chest. The sweatshirt got picked up by Colette in Paris, Antonioli in Milan, Urban Research in Tokyo and Opening Ceremony in the United States, and has been worn by the likes of Kid Cudi, who sported it at the “Hunger Games” premiere, as well as Olivier Nakache, the director of the recent French box-office record-breaker “Les Intouchables.” (“Can you help us get the sweatshirt on Jay-Z or anyone from the Nets?” Hassan asks.) Later this month, they’ll show their first full collection at the Paris men’s Capsule show; the collection includes pieces that would look right at home on the lazily fashionable young men of Bedford Avenue, including chambray shirts with baseball stripes ($100) and reversible cotton knit sweaters that droop on a skinny torso as raffishly as a cigarette from the lips of a Marais bobo ($164). The guys are making the clothes in conjunction with a magazine they publish that, in charmingly bad English, helps foreigners understand such Brooklyn characters as boricuas and Lubavitchers. “People in Paris want to be in New York and Tokyo, and vice versa and vice versa,” Obadia says. “Everybody doesn’t want to be where they are.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/paris-does-brooklyn/

The pace of the arguments about the article, “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” reflects the Internet age, Ms. Kantor writes:",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/the-breakfast-meeting-on-having-it-all-or-some-and-cracks-at-nbc-news/

2012-06-22,"Take One Critic, Add Mud, Mix","When TNT announced that it would be rolling out its first attempt at reality television, a competition show called “The Great Escape,” starting Sunday, it seemed as if it might be an opportunity to explore two long-standing questions I’ve had about the genre: Are these competitions real, and, more important, could I do this stuff? My editor felt the same way, especially about Question 2, since she’s a bit of an “Amazing Race” addict. So the two of us asked TNT and the creators of the show, Elise Doganieri and Bertram van Munster (who are also behind “The Amazing Race”), if we might come to a shooting location for “The Great Escape” and try out the course.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/take-one-critic-add-mud-mix/

But, as legions of readers know, Furst obviously dwells in another time and place, somewhere between Paris and the Carpathian Mountains, sometime between the blindly tragic years of 1933 and 1941, when the world, as he says in an earlier book, “drifted idly toward blood and fire.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/mission-to-paris-by-alan-furst.html

2012-06-22,"Traitor, Martyr, Liberator","Joseph Conrad wasn’t the only literary European who traveled through the Congo basin during the 19th-century rush to harvest the region’s ivory, animal hides, minerals and especially its “black gold” — the liquid latex that welled in its rubber trees. While journeying by caravan to Léopoldville in 1890 to take charge of the merchant ship Le Roi des Belges, Conrad met Roger Casement, a handsome 25-year-old Irish do-­gooder who had lived and worked in the Congo Free State for the past few years. Like Conrad, Casement had come to Africa buoyed by the conviction that European colonization would bring moral and social progress to the continent and free its inhabitants “from slavery, paganism and other barbarities.” Each man would soon learn the gravity of his error.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-dream-of-the-celt-by-mario-vargas-llosa.html

2012-06-22,You Can’t Say That,"The United States is almost alone among Western liberal democracies in not punishing what is called hate speech — oral or written messages that “incite hatred” against a person or group on the basis of their race, religion, sex, ethnicity or sexual orientation. Canada, Britain, Denmark, Germany and New Zealand have such laws, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights purports to require signatory nations to pass them. In the American constitutional tradition, by contrast, even detestable speech is permitted so long as the speaker does not threaten violence or incite others to it. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholding the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to engage in hateful picketing of military funerals in opposition to toleration of homosexuality (“God Hates Fags,” one sign said) is a ready example. That case would almost certainly have come out differently in other liberal democracies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-harm-in-hate-speech-by-jeremy-waldron.html

Shiller concentrated on the boom-bust cycle in technology stocks, but a later edition published while real estate was taking off correctly anticipated the popping of that bubble, too. With his latest volume, “Finance and the Good Society,” Shiller is coming at us from the opposite direction. Quoting Walt Whitman, who found “the eternal meanings” in muscular commerce, he celebrates finance’s “genuine beauty” and exhorts idealistic young students to pursue careers in derivatives, insurance and related fields.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/finance-and-the-good-society-by-robert-j-shiller.html

Touchingly, it is just a cleaned-up version of her working-class neighborhood, comprising tiny gardens and snowmen and clay model figures on which she eventually enacts a shameful voodoo. It’s no wonder Judith spends all day in her room. She is abnormally isolated — constrained by her father’s religious fundamentalism, which dictates that she sit out school assemblies and accept as her social circle the motley members of her church group, with whom she wanders through town trying to evangelize. Judith considers all of this within the range of normal. Only when she becomes the target of the class bully does the imminence of the End seem personal, and acute.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-land-of-decoration-by-grace-mccleen.html

2012-06-22,June 24 — 30,"AN early oratorio version of Paola Prestini’s multimedia opera, “OCEANIC VERSES,” was performed at New York City Opera’s Vox readings in 2011, and it left a mixed impression. But since then Ms. Prestini — an inventive composer whose style mixes the ancient and the up-to-date, the folk inspired and the artfully polished — has revamped the work, expanding it into a full opera, with a libretto by Donna Di Novelli and film by Ali Hossaini. The nonlinear story follows four characters — the Sailor, the Soldier, the Scholar and the Peasant — whose individual quests are linked by a search for a common past in the disappearing traditions of southern Italy. The characters have alter egos of sorts, film versions meant to represent their inner selves. The expanded work is having its New York premiere as part of the River to River Festival. The production is directed by Kevin Newbury, and Claudio Prima, Christopher Burchett, Helga Davis and Nancy Allen Lundy sing the principal roles, with Julian Wachner conducting Novus NY (the contemporary music ensemble of Trinity Wall Street), the Washington Chorus and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. 7:30 p.m. Monday, Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts, 3 Spruce Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-9401, rivertorivernyc.com; free.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/arts/june-24-30.html

But alas, the Angelina Effect has taken hold of red carpets everywhere, from New York to Hollywood and Antibes. A repeat offender, the model Anja Rubik took the look to new heights in an Anthony Vaccarello dress slit on the right for the Met Ball, and then in Roberto Cavalli at the Cannes Film Festival. “There is something so seductive about the movement of a dress with a high slit,” said Jason Wu, who designed the racy lace dress worn by the model Jessica Stam to the CFDA Awards earlier this month. “It definitely makes you look twice.” Also spotted at the CFDA Awards was the model Hilary Rhoda, in modernist Rebecca Minkoff. “Adding a slit to a long dress makes it feel less formal,” Minkoff said. “It’s a modern bombshell look.” That’s got legs, no doubt.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/look-of-the-moment-the-angelina-effect/

Cash-strapped cities averse to raising taxes can help pay the bills with the revenue from sponsorship deals.

In the first weekend of its Olympic trials, a dead heat for third place in the women's 100 means one of the marquee spots in the Olympics might be decided by a coin flip, or Allyson Felix or Jeneba Tarmoh could gracefully bow out for the good of making this seeming like less of a circus.

All of which is exposed by Will McAvoy (played by Jeff Daniels), a mad-as-hell-and-not-taking-it-anymore news anchor who decides he can do better — and an example of a stock Sorkin character type that The New Yorker’s TV critic Emily Nussbaum calls “The Great Man,” a character “who is theoretically flawed, but really a primal truth-teller whom everyone should follow (or date).”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/before-the-newsroom-there-was-the-newsroom/

He said security officials had assessed the current threat of a terrorist strike in Britain as substantial, meaning that an attack is “a strong possibility.” But he noted that the threat assessment was “one notch lower” than it had been for most of the period since the 2001 attacks in the United States. “There is no such thing as guaranteed security,” he said. “But I think we shall see a successful and memorable Games.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/world/europe/britain-security-chief-offers-assessment-about-olympics.html

Gensler is the architectural firm of record for the building, working with the Diller team on technical aspects of the project, including construction documents. Construction — to begin in early 2013 and take about three and a half years — will be supported by a previously announced lead gift of $50 million from Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, an alumnus of Columbia’s medical school, and his wife, Diana Vagelos. The design incorporates an auditorium; event areas; student lounges; cafes; and outdoor spaces, including a terrace with views of the Hudson River.

2012-06-27,Investigation Finds No Violations by Nuclear Head,"A report by the inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, released Tuesday, has found that the commission’s chairman did not exceed his authority in directing his agency’s response to the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown last year in Japan, despite his colleagues’ complaints over his management. The chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, has said he will resign as soon as a successor is sworn in, probably next week. The inspector general has investigated a variety of actions, but the new report does not find any clear violations. It said Dr. Jaczko had broken with past practice by seeking to change the recommendations of the commission staff, and that he limited staff communications with the other four commissioners in a way that “was inconsistent with the commissioners’ expectations.” His behavior was “not supportive of an open and collaborative work environment,” the report said.

But it is unclear how effective the algorithm is at saying something meaningful about the history of philosophy and, correlatively, the history of ideas.

Jake’s creepy condition forced him to eat a human being every month or perish, but otherwise he was a charming fellow.

Maybe it is a special Scottish thing.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/andy-murrays-osmolarity-is-looking-good-so-far/

Legaki, who studied psychology before moving into publishing, and Gaintitzis, a former photographer, first worked together in 2002, on the now-defunct Dynasty zine.

2012-06-28,California: Stockton Readies for Bankruptcy," Stockton officials have approved a new budget that will guide city operations during bankruptcy. When officials file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which could happen this week, Stockton will be country’s largest city to go bankrupt. The budget, approved Tuesday night, will suspend debt payments, cut employee pay and reduce retiree benefits, allowing the city of about 292,000 residents to continue providing essential services through the bankruptcy process. After nearby Vallejo, Calif., filed for bankruptcy in 2008, state lawmakers passed legislation requiring cities to hire a third-party mediator to negotiate with creditors before filing for bankruptcy. Stockton officials had hoped to avoid bankruptcy when the city entered into 90 days of mediation in March. But on Monday, the city and its creditors failed to meet a deadline for a deal.

After finally selling two to one department store, he was reduced to sending in his mother to buy them (the store then ordered more). It was only then that Jakobson thought to appeal to pediatricians — and struck upon the formula that would guarantee his success: clean-lined design, with a progressive medical seal of approval. Ultimately the chair would become a hit worldwide and a standard item on baby registries. But it was the Hjartenara (Close to the Heart) baby carrier, introduced in 1973 and later known as the Baby Bjorn, that made him a household name.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/who-made-that-baby-bjorn.html

On the way to a radiation treatment, when he asked permission to write about her, she gave her approval. “Hearing the pleasure in her voice,” Beha confesses, “was one of my happiest moments. . . .

2012-06-29,"Yes, Liberals Won","There was a widespread and bipartisan impulse, in the wake of yesterday’s health care ruling, to cast John Roberts’ exercise in political finesse as a potentially significant long-term win for conservatism. Variants of this case were made by George Will and Jay Cost on the right, Jonathan Chait and Tom Scocca on the liberal side of things, and many others besides. By affirming a limited and limiting reading of the Congress’s Commerce Clause powers even as he upheld the individual mandate for other reasons, Will wrote, the Chief Justice “rejected a constitutional rationale for the mandate … that was pregnant with rampant statism,” and laid the groundwork for a future in which the judiciary returns to its pre-New Deal habit of “viewing congressional actions with a skeptical constitutional squint, searching for congruence with the Constitution’s architecture of enumerated powers.” From the left, Chait made a version of the same point, worrying that a Roberts-led Court would now be able to advance a much more limited understanding of federal power by “a process of slow constriction,” rather than “one suddenly and transparently partisan attack.” The right lost the battle, these and other writers agreed, but thanks to Roberts’ savvy it could well be on its way to winning the larger size-of-government war.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/yes-liberals-won/

The defendant, Minh Quang Pham, 29, traveled to Yemen and took an oath of allegiance to the affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, received training from the group and provided it with expert advice and assistance in photography and graphic design, an indictment says. It also says that in April 2011, he worked with an American citizen in Yemen on the propaganda effort, and met with another American as well. The indictment does not identify the Americans, but their descriptions suggest they might be Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical Muslim cleric, and Samir Khan, who helped to produce Inspire, an English-language online magazine published by the group in Yemen.
