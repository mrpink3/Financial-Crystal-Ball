But the attack in Alsace deviated from usual patterns -- along with swastikas, the vandals painted slogans in German, including ''Jews out'' and ''One People, One Reich, One Fuhrer.'' The French authorities said they also found graffiti including the dates ''30 April 1945'' and ''30 April 2004.''

Bonnie pushed up her purple glasses, leaned over the surgery table and lowered her face inches from the patient to watch for any signs of breath: nothing. ''She's too deep,'' Roberts said, ''go ahead and give her 30 c.c.'s of fresh water.'' Bonnie picked up an old plastic jug filled with pond water and poured two glugs into the anesthesia machine. Seconds later, a whisper of a heart rate came through the Doppler. Bonnie wasn't happy: ''We have gill movement -- but not much.'' Then the Doppler went silent and she reached for the jug. ''Wait,'' Roberts said. ''We have fin movement . . . damn, she's waking up -- 30 c.c.'s of anesthetic.'' Roberts sighed. ''She was holding her breath,'' she said, shaking her head.

Lee Sr., the founder of the International Boxing Federation, who was sentenced to 22 months in prison in 2001 for bribery. Mr. King was an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. Mr. King had applied for a license twice, promoted fights reported to have earned him as much as $6 million, and then withdrew the applications before the commission could question him.

The result, in her new book, ''Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century,'' is a wayward and powerful blend of science, autobiography and imagination. Writing, for example, about Stanley Milgram's famous investigation at Yale, which revealed students' willingness, under orders, to administer what they believed were painful electric shocks to other people, Slater uses the second person to convey the point of view of one of the obedient torturers, a literary choice that nails her point: we all think we wouldn't turn up the voltage, but Milgram's results showed that 65 percent of us will.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/books/the-last-word-unpacking-skinner-s-box.html

2004-05-03,"First, Flay a Squirrel","The thesis of Torgny Lindgren's charming new novel sometimes seems to be: life isn't in the details -- it's in the entrails. Lindgren is a prominent novelist in his native Sweden; he also turns out to be a first-rate food writer, rapturously describing the flavor of ''various organs and body parts,'' ways to cook squirrels after you've flayed and gutted them and the best method for dispatching a pig's head. Big chunks of this book, which has been adroitly translated by Tom Geddes, could be dropped verbatim into Gourmet magazine. HASH (Overlook, $23.95) is set in postwar Sweden, where an eccentric newspaper reporter is banned from his trade when his editor discovers that the reports he's been filing for years are ''completely devoid of any basis in fact.'' When the editor dies half a century later, the unnamed reporter, now 107 and living in a nursing home, picks up his pen again, returning to his apparently true story of two strangers, a schoolteacher and a fugitive Nazi war criminal, who arrive in the tuberculosis-stricken village of Avaback to reinvent themselves. Will the writer, this time, finish the story of what happens when these two become so infatuated with the local version of a meat, offal and grain delicacy that they wind up scouring the country in a potentially fatal search for the ultimate version of the stuff? As the narrative alternates between the stir an unreliable reporter creates in his rest home and his tale of unlikely allies on a culinary quest, Lindgren delivers a story that's a clever sendup of the conceits of storytellers and a bittersweet meditation on life and the pleasures that bind us to it. Lindgren's characters understand that the secret to life isn't so different from the secret to good hash: both are best when ''just about everything goes into it.''

Once across the Bulgarian border everything changed: the landscape became more varied and interesting, and in the small towns and villages there were no raw, concrete apartment blocks (the norm in Turkey), only low, red-brick houses with red-tiled roofs and withering vines. The road was lined with metal shacks selling alcohol in all its forms, cigarettes and candy; there were stalls piled with bags of walnuts and tired-looking cabbages; there were cheerfully scruffy Gypsy boys who importuned any vehicle that so much as slowed down, and flocks of geese waddling home in the fading light. Maples, oaks and willows overarched the narrow road, and banks of feathery white reeds bordered it, as did, at irregular intervals, the kind of monumental sculptures to which all authoritarian regimes seem to be addicted. There seemed to be no particular reason for them to be where they were, and there was nothing to indicate what they might once have been intended to symbolize.

They would also require professional fund-raisers to register, prohibit political solicitation on state property, regulate the recorded telephone calls to voters and strengthen the Election Law Enforcement Commission, the agency that oversees elections.

2004-05-03,Unpacking Skinner's Box," It's sad to see an interesting writer go off the rails, but last month that is what seemed to have happened to Lauren Slater. After publishing some genre-twisting memoirs, Slater, a psychologist, wanted to celebrate landmark psychological studies as ''stories -- absorbed, reconfigured, rewritten.'' The result, in her new book, ''Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century,'' is a wayward and powerful blend of science, autobiography and imagination. Writing, for example, about Stanley Milgram's famous investigation at Yale, which revealed students' willingness, under orders, to administer what they believed were painful electric shocks to other people, Slater uses the second person to convey the point of view of one of the obedient torturers, a literary choice that nails her point: we all think we wouldn't turn up the voltage, but Milgram's results showed that 65 percent of us will.

It takes effect next fall. A study of the Princeton class of 2002 showed that 65 percent of students graduated with an average of B-plus or higher and that a student with a B average would rank 923 out of a class of 1,079. Students had voiced concerns during debate over the proposal that limiting A's would unfairly jeopardize them in job and graduate-school applications, since it would lower their grade-point averages relative to other colleges that did not limit A's. Dr. Malkiel stressed that the new guidelines were ''expectations,'' not strict limits, and that specific cases will be viewed on their merits.

They were Mormons, two crewcut, fresh-faced boys weighed down with books that they promised would save our souls -- souls that we weren't even certain we possessed. Reading the books enlightened us, however; we converted to Mormonism a few months later. And it worked -- for a time.

Moreover, I could not agree more that a great place to start is by adopting a personal health record for every American that is owned and controlled by the individual. As we have seen in other parts of the economy, when individual Americans are empowered with good information and freedom to choose, they drive an astonishing level of innovation, technological and otherwise, that delivers increasingly better results at an increasingly lower cost. We should not be surprised, then, that we are starting to see this same pattern occur in health care. New information-age health improvements are allowing individuals to be better informed about their own health and how to be informed consumers of health services, and are thereby saving lives and saving money. We need to accelerate these trends so that all Americans can benefit from improved health and lower costs.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/magazine/l-now-can-we-talk-about-health-care-396044.html

Mr. LaBute's last fully staged play, ''The Mercy Seat,'' set in Manhattan on the day after Sept. 11, 2001, is an unsparing drama about a man and a woman at the end of an affair, struggling to make a no-win moral decision.

The setting was the 2003 Munich Conference on Security Policy, an annual event attended by a who's who of European and American diplomacy, business and politics. At the time, Rumsfeld was at the height of his European unpopularity, thanks to his statements likening Germany to Libya and Cuba in their nonsupport of what was then the imminent Iraq war and his declaration that ''Old Europe'' was irrelevant.

2004-05-03,"Vengeance Is Ours, Says Hollywood","LAST weekend, the No. 1 movie in America was ''Man on Fire,'' a grisly and lugubrious action thriller in which Denzel Washington waged a one-man campaign of righteous payback against a diabolical gang of kidnappers in Mexico City. Joining Mr. Washington on the list of the top five money-makers (and separated from him only by the winsomely nonviolent Jennifer Garner in ''13 Going on 30'') were Tom Jane and Uma Thurman, the avenging heroes of ''The Punisher'' and ''Kill Bill Vol. 2.'' Mr. Jane's character, like Mr. Washington's, a former black-ops specialist for the United States government who struggles with a drinking problem, blows up half of Tampa, Fla., in his crusade against the baddies who wiped out his family. (That crime was itself an act of revenge for the accidental death of the chief villain's son.) In about the time it takes Mr. Washington's John Creasy to shoot, bludgeon and detonate a few dozen bad guys (two and a half hours, give or take), Ms. Thurman's Bride, showing impressive restraint, kills only two. But of course, if you add those loose ends to the legions of yakuza dispatched in a few minutes of ''Vol. 1,'' the Bride surely ranks as one of the most prolific onscreen practitioners of justifiable homicide in recent memory.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/movies/film-vengeance-is-ours-says-hollywood.html

2004-05-03,"Paid Notice: Deaths   ADAMS, WARREN SANFORD","ADAMS--Warren Sanford, 2d. Was born September 4, 1910 in Cleveland, Ohio to Otis Howard Adams and Hermine Weis Adams, and raised in Framingham, Massa chusetts. He passed away peacefully at his home in Austin, Texas on Sunday, April 25, 2004. Mr. Adams was a loving father to his only child Cornelia Adams Foster and father-in-law to Mark Edward Foster, and a loving grandfather to Lucy Piper Foster and Warren Adams Foster. Mr. Adams lived in New York City for most of his adult life prior to retiring in 1976 from CPC International Inc. (formerly Corn Products Co.) for which he served as chief general counsel. In 1986, he moved to Austin, Texas. At the age of 15, Mr. Adams entered Princeton University where his nickname was ''Babe.'' He was a star ice hockey player on a stellar team in Princeton history and, but for a broken collarbone suffered in a practice, would have played on a U.S. Olympic team. He also played on the football team at Princeton. After graduating in 1930, he went on to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1934. In 1935, he joined the New York bar and was in private practice in New York City until 1940. In 1941, he received a J.S.D. from New York University. With the onset of World War II, he went to Washington, D.C. to serve in the War Production Board and later enlisted in the Marine Corps. He fought in the Pacific between 1942 and 1946, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Returning to New York in 1946, he went to work for Corn Products Co. For many years he served on the board of the Washington Square Fund and was a trustee of the Whitehall Foundation, Inc. He was also a member of the American Bar Association, The Pilgrims of the United States, The English Speaking Union, The Racquet and Tennis Club (NYC), the Metropolitan Opera Club of which he was a past president, the Princeton Club, Colonial (Princeton), Ekwanok Golf Club (Vermont), American Society of the Order of St. John (Knight), Royal and Ancient Golf Club (Scotland), Boodles (London), and the Union Club (NYC). He was a lifelong golfer and lover of opera. He survived four wives, including Eve Madsen Adams (medical illustrator and mother of Cornelia), Adele Thompson Adams, and Romaine Clinton Adams. (He was divorved from a first wife prior to World War II.) For most of his life he was a summer resident of a part of the New Hampshire coast called Little Boar's Head. In later years he was a summer resident of Manchester, Vermont, and, during his marriage to Romaine Adams, of Newport, Rhode Island. His family particularly wants to thank Ken Luebke and caregivers who became part of his life following a car accident in 2000; James Mendiola, Mike Arnold, Tigh Walters, and Alfredo Ruiz. A memorial service will be held in Austin, Texas at 11:00 AM on Monday, May 3, 2004 at St. Francis Episcopal Church. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to Hospice Austin, 4107 Spicewood Springs Rd., Austin, TX 78759.

Vice President Dick Cheney, an expert on that topic, went to the site of Winston Churchill's ''Iron Curtain'' speech to make what was billed as a major speech on national security. Unfortunately, Mr. Cheney surprised his audience by launching into a mean-spirited attack on John Kerry instead. Mr. Kerry responded with a bewildering volley of documents and public statements.

Marilyn devouring hot dogs at a street stand in Manhattan and sharing a Coke with her husband, Arthur Miller. Marilyn being so much in love she couldn't care less about these few extra pounds on her hips. More than 50 previously unpublished photos of her are on display for the first time at the chic Cafe Einstein in Berlin, just a few blocks east of the Brandenburg Gate. All the photos in the exhibition, ''Marilyn -- The New York Years,'' were taken from 1954 to 1957 by a favorite photographer, Sam Shaw, who also shot the famous ''Seven Year Itch'' picture, featuring her with a white dress blown upward by a subway ventilator draft. ''I didn't want to get into this cliché of the depressive blonde again,'' said Thomas Lardon, who organized the exhibition and also published a book of the same title with 160 mostly unknown pictures of Monroe. ''Instead I wanted to show a very confident and strong woman who is simply at peace with herself.'' Until 1999, the year Shaw died, the pictures were stocked in a huge archive in New York. His son, Larry, found them and sold the rights to Mr. Lardon. The exhibition continues through May 31.

So far, of novels by Mr. Houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck), left, only ''Whatever'' has been adapted for the screen. In an interview with Le Monde, Mr. Houellebecq, 46, who divides his time between Ireland and Spain, said that after completing his new novel he would write the screenplay for it. To direct a movie, he noted, would offer respite from the extreme solitude that accompanies writing a novel. He added that he also hoped to write a movie version of his last novel, ''Platform'' (Knopf), which, he said, would work better on the screen than ''The Elementary Particles'' (Knopf), the novel that made his name in France in 1999.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/movies/arts-briefing-highlights-french-author-turns-film-auteur.html

From a business standpoint, Ed was fair, honorable and appreciative, a stand-up Brooklyn guy. His loss, however, is personally felt beyond a business relationship. After the initial disbelief, my feelings were automatically transformed to tears. My body was instinctively saying without words how I felt about Ed Chwatt. Once Ed suggested I consider what he had done by explaining to my elderly, infirm parents how much I loved them and appreciated what they had done for me. I told him my parents already intuitively understood how grateful I am. Ed responded, of course they do, but tell them anyway. They'll be glad you did and so will you. In that regard, I hope Ed intuitively understood that he was a respected friend of mine. Goodbye, friend.

His expertise and support greatly assisted the Atlantic Salmon Federation in achieving recognition as the leading Atlantic salmon conservation organization in the world.

Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people. Some agencies began moving in last December. Timothy J. McVeigh, convicted in the bombing, was executed in 2001. His co-conspirator, Terry L. Nichols, was given a life prison sentence in a federal trial but is now being tried by the state.

2004-05-06,Paris: Trying To Defuse Protests,"Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres moved Tuesday to dissuade angry French actors and technicians from disrupting next week's Cannes International Film Festival. He proposed an emergency plan to settle a 10-month-old dispute over unemployment benefits. Under the plan the government would create a $24 million ''special provisional fund'' to compensate for losses claimed by some 100,000 self-employed actors and technicians after changes were made in the unemployment system last June. Those changes led to protests that forced the cancellation of most of France's summer arts festivals last year. With the dispute unresolved throughout this winter, the Communist-led General Labor Confederation last month began threatening to disrupt the Cannes festival to apply pressure on the government. The initial reaction of representatives of the actors and technicians suggested they were not happy with Mr. Donnedieu de Vabres's offer. One labor spokesman called it a provocation and added that ''no one should be surprised if there are disturbances in next week's festivals.'' Meanwhile the festival's organizers have offered the protesters a forum at the festival, which runs May 12-23. ''We do not expect the Palais des Festivals to be taken by storm,'' Véronique Cayla, general director of the festival, told the left-of-center daily Libération. ''But we can't control everything.''

Takes First Action On Registry Enforcement,"The Federal Trade Commission has accused a California credit-repair service, the National Consumer Council, of violating the national ''do-not-call'' registry and deceiving customers who sought help in reducing their debts. The enforcement is the first of its kind in the government's crackdown on telemarketers. The group posed as a nonprofit organization to avoid complying with the list, the commission said in a lawsuit filed last month in federal court in Los Angeles and announced by the agency yesterday. The registry took effect in October to help block unwanted telephone solicitations from businesses. Nonprofit groups are exempt from the registry's rules. A judge in the case has frozen about $22 million in assets held by the defendants, an agency lawyer, Jennifer Larabee, said. The authorities shut down the group on Monday, The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. Nilou Salimpour, an outside publicist for the National Consumer Council, which is based in Santa Ana, Calif., said the group had helped thousands of consumers with debt problems. The organization contacted the commission to ask how to comply with the do-not-call list and never heard back, Mr. Salimpour said.

Scherer, near Forsyth, northwest of Macon, that violates the Clean Air Act.

2004-05-07,National Briefing: South," GEORGIA: COURT ORDERS REVIEW OF POWER PLAN A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit decided that the Environmental Protection Agency had acted ""arbitrarily and capriciously"" in ruling that Oglethorpe Power could receive a building permit for a power plant near Franklin in Heard County when it owns part of another plant, Robert W. Scherer, near Forsyth, northwest of Macon, that violates the Clean Air Act. The court said that ""without considering the issue at all,"" the E.P.A. assumed that it could consider only the parts of the Scherer plant that Oglethorpe owned and disregard the other parts, which are the polluters. The Georgia Power division of the Southern Company is a co-owner. The Sierra Club, which sued, said the plant was under the owners' common control.

2004-05-07,World Briefing | Africa: Libya: Six Foreigners Condemned Over H.I.V. Outbreak,"Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor were sentenced to death by firing squad on charges of deliberately injecting more than 400 Libyan children with H.I.V-contaminated blood in 1997-98. A Bulgarian doctor was given four years in prison. The suspects, who have been in prison since 1999, pleaded not guilty and said they would appeal. Libya initially accused the C.I.A. and Israeli intelligence of plotting the epidemic but later accused the foreigners of infecting the children as a part of an experiment to find a cure for AIDS. European governments and human rights groups criticized the sentence and said the outbreak was probably caused by unsanitary practices in the hospital before the suspects arrived in Libya.

2004-05-10,World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Russian Oil Stake Considered,"The French oil group Total, which announced quarterly results, said it would consider buying a stake in the Russian oil company Sibneft if Sibneft were to end its merger plan with Yukos, another major Russian oil company. In a conference call to discuss the group's quarterly results, Total's chief financial officer, Robert Castaigne, responded to recent speculation that the two companies were discussing such a stake by saying that Sibneft would have to part ways with Yukos first. Total reported that its quarterly earnings were down 8 percent at 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) for the first quarter of 2004, while sales dropped 2 percent to 28 billion euros ($33.8 billion). The company said its weaker results were caused by the weakness of the dollar relative to the euro and the rise of hydrocarbon prices, among other factors.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/business/world-business-briefing-europe-france-russian-oil-stake-considered.html

The movie is a remarkably assured film noir version of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' set in the indolent summer swankiness of the Hamptons. The cleverly plotted and well-observed script -- by Dick Wolf, the creator of ''Law and Order'' -- is like what might have resulted had James M. Cain collaborated with John O'Hara.

Assured that they have an appointment even though it's not in his book, Mr. Luchini settles back to listen to his new client's financial woes.

2004-05-10,"Those Strangers on a Train, Nine Years Later","''BEFORE SUNRISE,'' Richard Linklater's charming 1995 comedy starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, ended with a promise: the two characters, Jesse and Celine, would meet in Vienna six months later to continue the romance that began with a chance meeting on a train. Only a modest success at the time of its release, the film has become a dorm-room classic (much like Mr. Linklater's first two films, ''Slacker'' and ''Dazed and Confused'') with its portrait of reluctant adults torn between the cynicism of the day and the romance of their youth. Now Mr. Linklater, Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke have collaborated on ''Before Sunset,'' which picks up the story nine years later when Jesse and Celine meet at a Paris bookstore where Jesse is promoting his first novel, based on the night they spent together. The three share screenwriting credit on the film, which is dialogue heavy and packed with stirring monologues and grown-up revelations. In March, ''Before Sunset'' played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Mr. Linklater's hometown. He joined Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke to talk with Sarah Hepola about their collaboration.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/movies/summer-movies-those-strangers-on-a-train-nine-years-later.html

2004-05-10,The Best Live Footage You May Never See,"'MC5: A TRUE TESTIMONIAL' -- During their supernova ascension and decline, the members of the late-60's Detroit band MC5 became famous for draping themselves in American flags, replicating the free-jazz frenzy of late Coltrane through rock 'n' roll and preaching peace, love and, um, armed revolution. In this new documentary film by David C. Thomas and Laurel Legler (Future/Now Films), the three surviving band members tell their stories with vigorous honesty, almost as if they had never been asked before. The film has been screened at many festivals and can currently be seen at New York's Cinema Village, but its DVD release -- which was to have been last Tuesday -- has been held up, perhaps permanently, by legal disputes between the band's guitarist Wayne Kramer and the filmmakers. It's a shame that few people will see it: when the band is at its brief, brittle peak, the live footage is extraordinary. In one sequence, a gig identified onscreen as ''Media Conference, Buffalo, N.Y., March, 1969,'' a stageful of hippies -- band members, audience, all mixed together -- whirl in and out of contortions. The Buffalo hippies join hands to form a train and tear around the theater; people clutch each other in exhaustion, throw their hands in the air as if they've just caught the last fly ball of the World Series.

2004-05-10,"Marxian Madness, Western Hoo-Hah And a Great Escape","SHOWGIRLS V.I.P. EDITION -- (MGM, July 27) There's been much debate over whether Paul Verhoeven's sleazy 1995 fable about an ambitious tootsie named Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) is a good, bad or good-bad movie. Another question: Did Mr. Verhoeven know what he was doing when he laid on the seamy glitz, or did he set out to forge a serious exposé of ruthless showgirl shenanigans in Las Vegas? Nomi's nails -- glittery enameled pincers laced with sparkly sun-ray designs -- give the whole game away. These are serious nails -- the sort of thing to which a filmmaker must give some thought. And with these tacky talons, Mr. Verhoeven winks a message at us: none of us is immune to tales of decadence, fame and ruthless ambition. With ''Showgirls,'' Verhoeven resurrected the show-biz melodrama. The movie's brazenness is poisonously delicious, particularly the scene in which Nomi, a mere chorus girl, discreetly sends the lead dancer (Gina Gershon) tumbling down a set of steps, knowing she's next in line to take her place. Some of the extra features here, particularly a lap-dance tutorial by the dancers of the ''gentleman's club'' Scores, are gimmicky in a way the movie isn't. But this set does come with a fine pair of sequined pasties, which do fall into the ''so bad they're good'' category.

I was born on an island suspended midway on the golden trade route between East and West-a useful bauble, fingered and pocketed by the Portuguese, Dutch and British in turn. In 1902, when I was born, Sir Alban Marriott was Governor and he agreed to be my godfather. How could he refuse? He had been in thrall to my mother ever since she sent him the skin of a leopard she had shot, along with a note. I shall call on you between five and six this evening. The skin is for the small blue reception room, which is ideally suited to fornication and whatnot. Her name was Maud and she was a great beauty. Also a first-rate shot. In Scotland she had stalked deer with the Prince of Wales; his performance, she reported, was mediocre. He presented her with a brooch fashioned from an eagle's talon mounted on silver and onyx. Mater dismissed it as monumentally obvious and palmed it off on her stewardess in lieu of a tip on her voyage home. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/books/chapters/the-hamilton-case.html

2004-05-10,"Marxian Madness, Western Hoo-Hah And a Great Escape","DUEL IN THE SUN (MGM, May 25) -- When the producer David O. Selznick decided to outdo his ''Gone With the Wind,'' the result was this galumphing slab of western hoo-hah, which springs equally from the hothouse and the nut house. Jennifer Jones, thrashing and sneering and flashing her eyes (all the more noticeable because she's in dark pancake), plays a half-Mexican hottie who wants to be good but who can't resist the charms of an evil wrangler (Gregory Peck). The humid, lascivious atmosphere that the director, King Vidor, whipped up is so effective that even Peck manages a sexy performance. Epic kitsch, the movie plays like one long paroxysm -- especially Dimitri Tiomkin's ludicrously overwrought score (and there's nearly 15 minutes more of it in this DVD, which includes the composer's prologue and exit music). But the picture, from 1946, is often startlingly gorgeous to look at. The painted backdrops of Texas throb with bleeding color so intense that it looks as if the Surrealists and the Sierra Club had collaborated on a series of particularly lurid postcards.

Democrats want the resolution to call for a broad investigation up the chain of command, while Republicans are trying to limit the scope. In the House, Republicans will continue their election-year consideration of income tax measures.

2004-05-10,"Marxian Madness, Western Hoo-Hah and a Great Escape"," SHOWGIRLS V.I.P. EDITION (MGM, July 27) There's been much debate over whether Paul Verhoeven's sleazy 1995 fable about an ambitious tootsie named Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) is a good, bad or good-bad movie. Another question: Did Mr. Verhoeven know what he was doing when he laid on the seamy glitz, or did he set out to forge a serious exposé of ruthless showgirl shenanigans in Las Vegas? Nomi's nails — glittery enameled pincers laced with sparkly sun-ray designs — give the whole game away. These are serious nails — the sort of thing to which a filmmaker must give some thought. And with these tacky talons, Mr. Verhoeven winks a message at us: none of us is immune to tales of decadence, fame and ruthless ambition. With ""Showgirls,"" Verhoeven resurrected the show-biz melodrama. The movie's brazenness is poisonously delicious, particularly the scene in which Nomi, a mere chorus girl, discreetly sends the lead dancer (Gina Gershon) tumbling down a set of steps, knowing she's next in line to take her place. Some of the extra features here, particularly a lap-dance tutorial by the dancers of the ""gentleman's club"" Scores, are gimmicky in a way the movie isn't. But this set does come with a fine pair of sequined pasties, which do fall into the ""so bad they're good"" category.

They all had their names attached to their coats with safety-pins, and they carried little bags or satchels, and the regulation gas-mask. They wore knitted scarves and bonnets or caps, and many had knitted gloves attached to long tapes which ran along their sleeves, inside their coats, and over their shoulders and out, so that they could leave their ten woollen fingers dangling, like a spare pair of hands, like a scarecrow. They all had bare legs and scuffed shoes and wrinkled socks. Most had wounds on their knees in varying stages of freshness and scabbiness. They were at the age when children fall often and their knees were unprotected. With their suitcases, some of which were almost too big to carry, and their other impedimenta, a doll, a toy car, a comic, they were like a disorderly dwarf regiment, stomping along the platform.

Less well known are the roughly 1,600 of these photographs that were shot in color -- most notably by the photographers Russell Lee and Jack Delano -- using Kodachrome film, which Kodak introduced in 1936. This month, the Library of Congress and Harry N. Abrams are making a substantial collection of these images available for the first time in a book called ''Bound for Glory: America in Color 1939-43.''

''I have still a lot of dreams, just not in regard to my love life any more,'' she says briskly. ''It doesn't make me sad, it's just the way it is.'' Those last words come out in a subdued shriek, as if she's daring him to contradict her. Three minutes of verbal dueling later, Jesse is planted on her sofa looking anguished and joyful. She sits on the bed, strumming a guitar and singing him a waltz she wrote about a long-ago ''one-night thing'': theirs. The lyrics are light and rueful, like Ms. Delpy's voice. Then she reaches the punch line. ''My heart will stay yours until I die,'' she sings; and because neither her tone nor her expression changes, the nakedness of the declaration takes your breath away.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/movies/summer-movies-the-scene-stealers-julie-delpy.html

2004-05-10,'American Desert'," THAT THEODORE STREET WAS dead was not a matter open to debate. The irony of his accidental death went unobserved as no one knew that Theodore was on his way to commit suicide when he was, shall we say, interrupted. Now the irony is lost amid the confusion created by Ted's death, departure, demise, dissolution and further by the fact that Ted chooses to relate his own story in third person, an unusual (the occasional politician and athlete aside), but acceptable device, given that, in a most profound way, he stood-or stands even-outside himself, not so much on the parapet of consciousness but of life itself, it being perhaps the case that neither entails, necessarily, the other. But regardless of where Ted stood, or stands, he was on his way to the beach where he had every intention of marching into the ocean until it was over his head and taking a deep, lung-filling breath of water which, according to his limited knowledge of human physiology, would result in a termination of his life, barring the interference of some lifeguard or Boy Scout or Girl Scout, though he had never found Girl Scouts to be terribly overzealous or meddlesome. He was driving at a respectable clip along Ocean Boulevard when a fat man chased his nails-painted poodle out into the street before a UPS truck, causing the driver of the huge, brown block to swerve and slide into a lane of oncoming traffic, the oncoming traffic in this case being Ted Street in his 1978 Lancia coupe. The truck and the Lancia met violently and whereas his vehicle halted quite abruptly, Ted did not, but continued in the same direction he had been traveling through the already cracked windscreen. Remarkably, Ted's face suffered not a single scratch and neither did his body break about the ribs, clavicles, arms or legs, but his head did become rather cleanly detached from the rest of him. It was a jagged but complete wound around his neck that left one seasoned police officer vomiting by the accordioned front fender of the Lancia while the young rookie on patrol with him stood, mouth agape, staring at the head lying on the asphalt. Unlike the stories of beheaded Frenchmen stealing one last, pitiful look at their cast-off bodies, Ted had no such perception. He died instantly and, in a manner of speaking, completely. The UPS man was beside himself, so much so that he would later attend Ted Street's funeral and subsequently take a civil service examination in order to change his profession. The coroner's wagon came with a representative of the coroner, not the coroner himself, and the young man observed Ted's head from his wagon door and was satisfied that he was dead, making the requisite marks on his clipboard, but having to call his office to ask whether head and body should be placed in the same or separate bags. Ted's head was placed under his left arm, the fingers of his hand falling over his mouth which was frozen partly open, and the cool vinyl bag was zipped from bottom to top. The ride in the coroner's wagon to the morgue was protracted, the medical examiner's assistant stopping at a fast-food restaurant, his mother's house, a comic-book store and a remote parking lot where he charged gang thugs a dollar each to ""see the stiff.""

His selection of images -- of the horrors of war, portraits of Picasso and Cartier-Bresson, of treasures of the Kremlin, actors on the set of the film ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and of his beloved dog, Thor -- blends into his account of ''waiting . . . for that fleeting touch of magic on the face of life itself.'' Duncan joined the Marines and photographed World War II, then shot fishing expeditions on the Miskito coast of Nicaragua, landscapes in Ireland and Afghanistan, Palestinian refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and marines in Vietnam. He was an outspoken opponent of the war (''beardless children fought wars for combat innocent tycoon-politicians who hijacked America's military -- camouflaged their agendas and ambitions then sold them to a trusting nation through media extravaganza''), but his images of combat should not overshadow others, particularly his series of Berbers in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco; they are quiet yet stunning and rich in color, and no less powerful.

This delicately calibrated picture is proof that even if there really are no new stories, there will always be new ways to tell them. Mr. Sheridan tells his, largely about adjusting to life in a place that is sometimes not so welcoming, through the faces of his actors, Paddy Considine, Samantha Morton, the sisters Emma and Sarah Bolger and Djimon Hounsou, as a neighbor who becomes part of their clan. In his seductively conversational commentary track, Mr. Sheridan breaks stride every so often to exclaim over one of his actors' faces. Of Ms. Morton: ''I love that woman's eyes! How can you not?'' Noting a particularly striking shot of 5-year-old Emma Bolger, whose unstudied performance is one of the picture's marvels, he blurts out, ''Look at that face!'' as if he were seeing it for the first time.

The ballot was nonbinding, yet Mr. Sharon faces a dilemma as he plots his next move. If puts the same plan to his cabinet, it could again face rejection. If he dilutes the proposal, and tries to keep some Israeli soldiers and settlers in Gaza, he could lose the backing of Israelis who currently support the move. Opinion polls show that 60 percent or more of Israelis favor a full withdrawal from Gaza. Yet Mr. Sharon, the leading advocate of settlement building for decades, has been unable to win over his traditional right-wing allies. He needs their support to keep his coalition government intact. But from their perspective, handing over Gaza to the Palestinians would be a ''reward for terrorism.''

In many places, it was an unusually warm month without precipitation.

Ranchers have radically destocked the range. In Arizona and New Mexico, more than a million acres of pinyon and ponderosa pine have died off.

The new Savoy Opera at the 1,100-seat Savoy Theater on the Strand seemed to start well enough last month, with some good reviews and loads of publicity for its first two productions, Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' and Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro.'' But Raymond Gubbay and Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, the two impresarios who each invested $4.5 million on the gamble, are also businessmen. On Friday they announced that ticket sales did not justify continuing after the first two productions end their run on June 19. In a statement they said they would be reviewing their plans, but for the moment scheduled presentations of ''Carmen,'' ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' ''La Traviata'' and ''La Belle Hélène'' are off. ''We'll see what can be done, but it won't be immediately,'' Sir Stephen said. Asked where he and Mr. Gubbay had miscalculated, Sir Stephen added: ''We don't have answers. If we had an answer, it would be easy.'' ALAN RIDING",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/arts/arts-briefing-highlights-west-end-opera-stumbles.html

2004-05-12,'The Politics of Truth': Don't Tread on Joseph Wilson," THIS is a riveting and all-engaging book. Not only does it provide context to yesterday's headlines, and perhaps tomorrow's, about the Iraq war and about our politics of personal destruction, but former Ambassador Joseph Wilson also tells captivating stories from his life as a foreign service officer with a long career fostering the development of African democracies, and gives us a behind-the-scenes blow-by-blow of the run-up to the 1991 Persian Gulf war. As the top American diplomat in Baghdad, Wilson was responsible for the embassy, its staff and the lives of other Americans in the region - not to mention the freeing of hostages in Kuwait. He goes on to relate his eye-to-eye encounter with the wily sociopath Saddam Hussein; his return home to be greeted as a ''true American hero'' by President George H. W. Bush; his stint advising America's top military commander in Europe; and his time as head of the African affairs desk of Bill Clinton's National Security Council, where he assembled the president's historic trip to Africa while the ''Starr inquisition'' into the Monica Lewinsky affair developed. Along the way he fell in love with and married a C.I.A. covert operative - a ''willowy blonde, resembling a young Grace Kelly.''

2004-05-14,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Less Cellphone Number Switching Than Expected,"The Federal Communications Commission said yesterday that rules allowing consumers to keep cellphone numbers when switching carriers had a weaker impact on the industry than expected. But the new rule, which became effective last November, has increased competition among carriers. John B. Muleta, chief of the commission's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, said more than two million numbers had been transferred since last November, far fewer than the 12 million some industry analysts had predicted. The rule has caused a shift in market share among carriers, Mr. Muleta said, without providing specifics. Company reports show AT&T Wireless had the most defections by customers in the first quarter, while Verizon Wireless had the fewest. Number portability has only been available in the 100 largest markets since November. On May 24, number portability will become available in the rest of the country.

The company halted pharmacy sales of Propulsid in July 2000, after the drug was linked to at least 300 deaths. Jurors in a state court in Port Gibson, Miss., found that a Johnson & Johnson unit sold Propulsid knowing that some users experienced dangerous side effects when taking it with other drugs and awarded the former users $10 million each. The judge in the case had already slashed the total award to $48 million.

2004-05-14,The Wrong Direction,"Watching President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld this week, it was hard to avoid the sinking feeling that they had already moved on from the Abu Ghraib prison mess and were back to their well-established practice of ignoring all bad news and marching blindly ahead as if nothing unusual had happened. That was the impression that emerged from Mr. Bush's disconnected performance on Monday, when he viewed photos and video stills of the atrocious treatment of prisoners by soldiers under his and Mr. Rumsfeld's command, and then announced that the defense secretary was doing a ''superb job.'' It was stronger than ever yesterday, during Mr. Rumsfeld's road trip to Iraq, where he drew a curious parallel between himself and Ulysses S. Grant and announced his approach to the prison scandal: ''I've stopped reading newspapers.''",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/14/opinion/the-wrong-direction.html

Museler, said. The group said that the state had installed an additional 3,000 megawatts of in-state energy generation since 2001, but that 2,000 to 4,000 more megawatts should be added by 2008 to be within safe limits.

2004-05-17,'The Cello Player'," There was no cemetery as far as the eye could see. The taxi driver, a heavy, sullen man with a bird face, made a vague gesture with his right hand in response to my question about where I should go, but without speaking; he was silent now, having spent the entire ride addressing with growing impatience a radio show and the tattered, rattling voice of the dispatcher. I should have asked the friendly taxi driver who had brought me from the Budapest airport to the hotel an hour earlier to wait after all. He had offered me everything-young women, nightclubs, gypsy music: You say, I get. But I'd wanted to rest for ten minutes before the funeral, so I sent him off. Where is the cemetery? I implored the bird man, from the backseat, while he calmly lit another cigarette on the stub of the old one, sending a shower of sparks onto his loosely knit sweater. He had stopped under a tree whose sooty leaves hung limply from its branches; behind the tree was a dilapidated square where an old car without wheels was sulking; in the distance were a few cowering houses. No people and no graves in this wasteland. Fortunately, the hotel porter had written down the address of the cemetery for me, so now, with the driver gazing at me suspiciously, I looked for the slip of paper as I sat in the oppressive, cramped vehicle, which was full of smoke and incomprehensible sounds. I was beginning to sweat. I had assumed as a matter of course that taxi drivers in this part of the world cheated their fares-an assumption that the hotel porter had confirmed by pocketing a sizable tip-still, the thought that this deadly driver would abandon me in this no-man's-land simply for his own amusement was more than I could bear. And yet, I couldn't afford to annoy him, for there were hardly any other cars in the area, let alone taxis; but above all, there was no cemetery. I looked for the note; the man kept smoking and coughing, then he opened the car door and spat a heavy glob of phlegm on the dusty ground. The situation was so outrageous and humiliating that I was just about to shout the name of the hotel at the man and demand that I be taken back to my starting point when I finally found the note crumpled up in the breast pocket of my suit and triumphantly held it out to him. Here, the address of the cemetery, I urged the laconic fellow, who peered at the unprepossessing document out of the corner of his eye and nodded thoughtfully. He started the car and again began a steady muttering and carrying-on, as if he had put the ignition key into his speech center. The view outside the cab did not improve, particularly as a fine rain began to fall, covering the dreary neighborhood with a gray mist. Any hope I'd had of arriving at the cemetery a half-hour before the burial-not only to get a sense of where the grave was but also to explore possible escape routes-dissolved as I rode in my smoky cage. I wondered if we would ever arrive. Then the driver pulled into a gas station, shouting and snorting, and stopped beside a pump that did not look especially promising. He got out, fumbled at the back with the tailgate, and then disappeared for some time. I finally caught sight of him behind the car, tearing large chunks from an enormous sandwich he held in one hand and guzzling a cloudy liquid, probably cider, from a bottle he held in the other. As he stood there chewing and drinking in front of the radiator, I noticed that the left side of his face was disfigured by a red, frayed patch of eczema that spread over his eye and ran down his neck under the collar of his greasy sweater. As he made no effort at all to fill the tank, and no attendant put in an appearance, I energetically pushed my coat, suit, and shirt-sleeves from my wrist and tapped several times on my watch with my right index finger, assuming this gesture must be recognizable anywhere in the world. Not a twitch of comprehension in his face. But once the last of the sandwich had vanished into his maw and the bottle had been stowed in the trunk he decided it was time to fill up his tank. When at last the counter on the pump had come to a halt while there was still a chance of reaching our destination, for which we had set out more than an hour ago, the man tore open the door on my side and barked furiously at me. That could only be about money, I thought. So I pulled out the bundle of bills that a tired woman in the hotel had given me in exchange for my hundred marks, and put a medium-sized bill into the outstretched palm. But the hand did not close on the bill. Nor did it close after I had put two more on top of the first. By then, a group of ragged people had stepped closer, forming a half-circle around the driver and watching the silent transaction. Among them was a woman with a pom-pom hat who shamelessly thrust her shaggy head into the car and reached out her hand to snatch one of the bills. I had no idea how much money I had handed over or how much I was still holding, nor did the hostile maneuvers I found myself subjected to give me time to figure it out. I had to act. The only way out of this situation was to attack. I pulled myself out of the backseat with the bundle of remaining money firmly in hand, stood up, legs apart, in front of the group of people gathered around the taxi driver, paused for a moment, then screamed as loud as I could: If I am not taken to the cemetery at once, I'll have the police throw all of you in jail! And as I kept on screaming, rousing myself with the worst profanities and proud of the courage I never knew I had, I butted my fist into the chests of the flabbergasted men and, with a swipe, knocked the shameless pom-pom hat from the woman's head. Even the driver seemed impressed. Don't stop now; don't drop the reins. In my mounting rage, I was about to go for the throat of the crimson bird-head when a little oil-smeared man stepped between us and, in excellent German, asked about the cause of this violent confrontation. I want to go to the cemetery, I yelled; where the hell is the goddamn cemetery this idiot refuses to take me to, even though he has already taken wads of money from me! It's a scandal for a visitor to be treated like this; the simplest rules of hospitality have been violated; all of Hungary is being infiltrated by scoundrels who are entirely ignorant of the laws of civilization....

And their consequences are unpredictable, even to their originators and the pioneers who believed in them and initiated them. After all, the first financially successful railroad in the world was an amusement ride in London. Many of us remember when plastics were useful for little except toys, kitchen gadgets and decorative touches that taste-makers derided for their vulgarity. That was before strong, lightweight plastics, reinforced with fibers of glass, boron or carbon, replaced metals in the making of springs and joints. These plastics transformed serious spectacle frames like mine. At last I have frames that never hurt my nose and ears and that last for years without weakened joints. These plastics were originated by the makers of tennis rackets and of rods for surf and sport fishing. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/magazine/the-greening-of-the-city.html

2004-05-17,"Paid Notice: Deaths   PASSIN, HELEN LATHAM","PASSIN--Helen Latham. On May 7 at age 82, of complications following pneumonia. After serving in the Army during World War II and making (only!) one parachute jump that she never tired recounting the horrors of, Helen fled her frigid New England roots for the infinitely more cosmopolitan and romantic surroundings of her beloved New York City. She led a successful and varied career in the media and the fashion world, working as a researcher and interviewer for The New Yorker and NBC's ''Today Show'' and ''The Tex & Jinx Show.'' She later served as director of public relations for Best & Co., Franklin-Simon and Lord & Taylor. For most of the 1960s, she was a principal in her own firm with partner and former supermodel Muriel Maxwell, directing the promotional efforts of such designers and accounts as James Galanos, Arnold Scaasi, Kislav Gloves, London Fog and Marcel Rochas. She also served as Fashion Editor for American Weekly, where she worked extensively with leading fashion photographer (and lifelong friend) J. Frederick Smith. She was married for more than 40 years to renowned Japanologist and Columbia University professor Herbert Passin, who pre-deceased her in 2003. It was from the couple's extraordinary Garment Center penthouse loft in the shadow of the Empire State Building that Helen truly established her credentials as an entertainer, friend and mentor to the famous, would-be famous and not-so-famous. With the ease and dexterity of a bartender at the Ritz, she mixed brilliant academics with sixfoot tall fashion models, and futurologists like Herman Kahn and writers like Leo Rosten with musicians, vagabonds, journalists, visiting professors, earnest young graduate students and even, occasionally, impoverished undergrads. It was always a combination of refined elegance and down-to-earth humor. In the process, Helen took many friends, both young and old, under her wing, dispensing advice, wisdom and -- always -- strong opinions wherever she went. When the Passins later moved their base to a sprawling apartment in Morningside Heights, the views of Manhattan may have suffered, but not the personal and family friendships. A large group of admirers gathered there one last time this past week to toast her extraordinary life. She is survived by a son, Scott Latham; three step-children, John Latham, Katharine Butler and Tom Passin; and five grandchildren, Victoria Latham, and James, Laura and Mark Passin, and Luke Butler.

Stone, they called for 288 additional screeners, saying that the current number, 1,200, is inadequate to ensure air passenger safety. They said that federal officials rather than private companies should assume direct control for hiring screeners. And they called for better working conditions, including break rooms, for screeners whose turnover rate has been 17 percent. ''We ask baggage and personnel screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport to provide a vital layer of security for the traveling public, yet the conditions in which they are required to toil only contribute to skyrocketing stress levels,'' they wrote.

Adding to the hazard of our missteps is the danger that the use of our superiority in technological weaponry on a population generates suffering that leads to the same sort of feeling of helplessness, sense of outrage and thirst for retaliation that the barbarism of 9/11 generated in us, further stoking the cycle of violence.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/magazine/l-lesser-evils-567442.html

2004-05-17,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Nutter in Glasgow,"Before cracking open Anne Donovan's first novel, BUDDHA DA (Carroll & Graf, paper, $14), you are advised to converse at some length with a Scot -- or, failing that, to rent a copy of ''Trainspotting.'' ''Ma Da's a nutter,'' announces 12-year-old Anne Marie McKenna in the book's opening line, a taste of the somewhat labor-intensive reading to come. Anne Marie's ''Da,'' a goofy Glasgow housepainter named Jimmy McKenna, has ''turnt intae a Buddhist,'' to the consternation of his family. Instead of going to the pub on Tuesdays, he's begun frequenting the Buddhist Center, and what's more, lamas keep dropping by the house. The transcribed brogue and gag-rich premise initially lend ''Buddha Da'' a slapstick feel. But as Jimmy's engagement with Buddhism deepens, the novel matures into an astute exploration of Donovan's enormously appealing characters. (The language also becomes fluently readable and clearly indispensable to the book's flavor.) Chapters rotate between the first-person narratives of Anne Marie, Jimmy and Liz, his wife, and through these three perspectives, an intimate and comprehensive family portrait emerges. At the story's heart is the disruption of a loving but heretofore unexamined marriage: no-nonsense Liz increasingly has trouble assimilating her husband's commitments to meditation, vegetarianism and celibacy; Jimmy is a devoted, if self-absorbed, family man who ''always thought that wanst ah'd found whitever it was ah was lookin fur, well, ah'd just go back tae ma life.'' Inevitably, his own growth dislodges settled patterns, and the subsequent realignment is wistfully satisfying to behold.

She was born in Dahlem, Germany, and had an epic life both astounding, amazing and distressing. Her father was a Socialist and the kindest man imaginable. He was a philanthropist, giving his wealth to those who had less than he. He persisted in his altruism giving to so many and was betrayed in Marseilles by, it is believed, his driver, and sent to a concentration camp where he was slaughtered with millions of others. Eva married a Rumanian writer, Valeriu, who had left Bucharest quite early in his adult life for Berlin, where he met his future wife at her father's at one of his famed social revelries. Valeriu was always the life blood of any celebration and went to countless such evenings. Her brother was a gentle soul who died at their house in Grasse, in the South of France, where he lived after the war. He had been in British intelligence. With the threat of WWII, Eva and Valeriu moved to Nice, France where Valeriu helped Varien Fry liberate and help to emigrate thousands of artists. It was in Nice where the Marcu's gave birth to a girl, whom they named Miki. Eva and Valeriu, moved to the U.S. (with the help of significant writers given special visa for authors and other intellectuals) and escaped the Nazis. Valeriu died in New York some years later at the age of 40. Eva, therefore, lost the three most momentous men in her life within a few years of each other. She was always the most munificent person (inheriting her father's trait) and gave money, time and her enormous soul to those whom she also thought had less than she, at a time when she had very little. Her gifts were at all times anonymous. She had the soul of an angel, but too unassuming to ever understand or recognize compliments. Her curiosity was inexhaustible and her intelligence dazzling and incomparable. She was Professor of literature at various Universities (Columbia, Mannes, Rutgers), and wrote books and articles, the most significant of which are the maxims of Montaigne and her analysis on the injurious Nationalism of the 16th century and her hero of heroes. Mme de Sevigne (1646-1705), whose letters warmed Eva's heart. She was her hero of heroes. She cherished languages and spoke several. In her 80's and on, she forced herself to translate an hour of Latin each evening, thinking she would stave off Alzheimer's. She hated those hours, but made this bargain between the devil and her brain. In March 2003, afraid that her health was failing and that she would be a burden to her daughter, as the indomitable woman she was, without ever seeking advice or consent, decided to move to an independent living home at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, (coincidentally, the same city where her husband had died). After 8 months her leg was arterially so clogged that nothing other than amputation above the knee was possible. From then on her health declined and she went from her charming apartment overlooking the Hudson and the woods, to the hospital and rehabilitation home then back to her apartment. She quickly deteriorated. She was at all times grace under trauma. Despite her brilliance, modesty prevented her from recognizing how many people cared for her. While in the hospital and at home she received ca. 200 email letters and cards and telephone calls. Her daughter, so inestimably grief-stricken inconsolably mourns her.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/classified/paid-notice-deaths-marcu-eva-d-nee-gerson-phd.html

The bill's sponsors said at last week's joint session in the Trenton War Memorial that the vote would again be postponed until tomorrow to give time for a review of a second set of amendments. But two South Jersey senators, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester, and John H. Adler, a Democrat from Camden, said afterward they had not been ready to vote. The Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, a keystone in Governor McGreevey's environmental initiative, would severely restrict development near reservoirs and feeder streams in half of 800,000 acres across the northern tier of the state. A spokesman for the governor, Micah Rasmussen, promised that the administration would continue to press for passage.

In the meeting, which lasted into the evening on Wednesday, the committee members heard from only a handful of citizens and good-government groups who had come to a center for the elderly in this suburb of Philadelphia. Even for many Assembly members, about a dozen of whom addressed the committee, the hearing was their first chance to publicly discuss the practice known as ''pay to play.'' The Assembly's Democratic leaders joined Senate leaders in pledging to enact sweeping ethics legislation by July 1. The overriding issue was whether a pay-to-play ban should apply only on the state level, as the Democrats propose, or whether it should also apply to the county party organizations that wield outsize influence in New Jersey.

Henry was committed to fighting for the ideas, causes, and people he believed in.

2004-05-18,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Museum Wins Expansion Fight,"A lawsuit that sought to stop the Metropolitan Museum of Art from its long-planned expansion was dismissed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit pitted the museum against a group of wealthy neighbors known as the Metropolitan Museum Historic District Coalition, which says it fears that the Met expansion will draw more visitors to the museum and add to the taxis, school buses and carnival of performers along Fifth Avenue. The museum contends that the number of visitors, currently about five million a year, will remain unchanged. According to the Met, the museum's exterior will not be expanded, but the amount of available space inside will grow. The group argued that a 1971 agreement with the city restricted the museum's ability to expand. A lawyer for the group said it planned to appeal the suit's dismissal. Judge Marcy S. Friedman ruled, among other things, that the relief the group sought, including an environmental review, was moot because the statute of limitations had lapsed.

One of the most significant publishing deals ever made by the Aberbachs was the acquisition of the exclusive publishing rights to the music of Elvis Presley in 1955. By the early 1970's the Aberbach business had become a worldwide music force. Julian Aberbach was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 15, 2000.

From her mother she inherited a passion for teaching, and from her father the art of story telling. Laughter with an ironic twist was always the common denominator. Ms. O'Brien, the daughter of the late Frank J. and Agnes Ring O'Brien, was born in Cleveland, OH, and grew up in Meriden, CT. Ms. O'Brien, who taught French and the Classics for nearly 50 years, graduated from Albertus Magnus College with a major in Classics, entered the Dominican Sisters of Columbus, OH in 1943, received her MA in French literature at Fordham University, studied in France on a summer Fulbright grant, and taught in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as well as at Mary Immaculate School in Ossining, NY, Dominican Academy and the Rhodes School, both in Manhattan. After leaving the Dominican community in 1973, she taught until 1987 in New Jersey's Morris Hills Regional school system where she relished deep friendships with colleagues and students for the rest of her life. While leading a student group to France in 1969, she met Mr. Jerry Berlin who has remained her dear companion and confidant until her death. Together, they welcomed friends and relatives to her New Jersey home. An avid world traveler who studied Spanish and Italian at an advanced age, she served as a lector and eucharistic minister in her parish until her recent illness. Deeply committed to peace, Ms. O'Brien deplored our country's preemptive war policy. In addition to Mr. Berlin of Manhattan, Ms. O'Brien leaves behind two sisters, A.

Dr. Crew, who earned $245,000 a year in New York, left his post there in 1999 after a battle over a plan by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to experiment with school vouchers.

2004-05-19,Six Questions for Iran: Transcript," NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. The first question is basic: Was the Islamic revolution a mistake? And in talking to Iranians today I've been amazed by the number who keep saying, yes, it was a mistake. Almost nobody really seems to have anything very nice to say about the revolution. IN THE TEAHOUSE KRISTOF. In Isfahan there is a lovely, lovely teahouse along the river right under the bridge and just a fabulous place. And I sat down and talked with a number of people there. One middle-age man was sympathetic in some ways to the revolution, but he acknowledged like everybody else that it had gone deeply astray. He wanted Iran to be united with the rest of the world again. IRANIAN MAN (captions). We'll never be able to go back to the time before the revolution in 1979. But the existing government should let people have a more relaxed and freer lifestyle. People should be free. But, the government is the government. The ideal would be to return to the root of it. The days right after the revolution. IN THE FIELDS KRISTOF. I had the idea that people in rural areas would be more conservative and maybe more supportive of the regime. And sure enough, they were very conservative socially. Initially, when I asked about the government they said: Oh, yeah, everything's great. IRANIAN MAN. [speaking Farsi] KRISTOF. It took about five minutes for them to say: Well, of course things were even better under the Shah. IRANIAN MAN (captions). If it were possible, I'd go back to the way things were before the revolution. Back then people were honest. They didn't have to pretend that they were religious. It wasn't as corrupt. KRISTOF. And it turned out that every one of them thought that things had really gone fundamentally downhill since the Islamic revolution. North of Isfahan we drove off the main road and spoke to a couple of farmers. And we asked them whether the revolution had been a, you know, a good idea or a mistake. And I was surprised by just how bluntly they said that it had been a mistake. IRANIAN MAN (captions). I hear the elders say that there is a chance that the Shah's son could return. Life in the villages was much better under the Shah. More attention needs to be paid to the needs of the villages and to the concerns of young people. KRISTOF. That question of the legitimacy of the revolution I think is something that fundamentally goes to the very nature of the regime today. IN THE MOSQUE KRISTOF. The one place in Iran where you would expect the Iranian revolution to be really cherished is the religious capital of Qom. In Qom, I sat down in the office of Ayatollah Montazeri, who's a grand ayatollah, one of the very leading clerics of Shia Islam. He was one of the architects of the Iranian revolution. For a long time he was designated to be the successor of Ayatollah Khomeini and the supreme leader of Iran. But these days he was just withering in his criticism. KRISTOF. What is the status of the Islamic revolution now, the health of it? Is it in good health? Is it sick? And if it's sick, is it terminally ill? AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI (captions). The full freedom in which all people participate in a democratic process has not been achieved. If the demands that the people made at the time of the revolution are not achieved, then it is possible that people will start shouting those demands again. Since the trend in the world today is not one of force and imposing things on people, you cannot force people to have religion. Either officials change their methods and give freedom to the people and stop fixing the elections, or the people will rise up once again in revolution. STILL THE GREAT SATAN? KRISTOF. So is America the great Satan? I've been asking Iranians that. And it's strange being an American in Iran. There are so few of us. And the propaganda is unrelentingly negative. The old U.S. embassy is now called the den of spies. And it's surrounded by vicious murals of the U.S. But everywhere you go people are incredibly friendly to you. I mean there is much more pro-Americanism evident in Iran than in just about any country you could possibly go to. Maybe most of all when you talk to Iranians about the slogans like ``Death to America,'' they're almost a little embarrassed by them. It's like if people ask America about our policies toward the Indians 200 or 300 years ago, there's just a sense that belongs to a very distant past, they're not responsible for it, that they don't want to be tied to that policy. Indeed, 60 percent of Iranians were born after the Iranian revolution. And for them America's really been something missing in their lives. It hasn't been an evil force. It's just been kind of a nonentity. DEATH TO AMERICA KRISTOF. There's another huge mural of the American flag with missiles for the stripes. And right in front of it I stopped some pedestrians and talked to them about their attitudes toward the U.S. And people would clearly like to have better relations with America. IRANIAN MAN (captions). I have no hard feelings toward the United States and I like Americans, but when President Bush says we're a wild country, that's very disrespectful. We have 5,000 years of history. It's offensive when that isn't respected. How much civilization do you have? KRISTOF. There's a real prickliness to the idea of being bullied by America or told what to do by America or told by the U.S.: Oh, you can't have nuclear weapons. That goes over very, very poorly. ADMIRATION FOR AMERICA KRISTOF. On the Iranian weekend, which is a Thursday and Friday, I went out to the hills outside of Tehran where people go hiking and spoke to a number of people. A 34-year-old woman, she emphasized that, you know, people now have their own sources of information. That times have changed and the government no longer has a monopoly on information. She said, you know, we go to the Internet. We watch satellite TV. And I think that that is very much behind the admiration for America. SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. KRISTOF. Can women be equal in Iran? There's no question that women are second-class citizens right now in a lot of ways, but maybe not as much as Americans think. We see Iranian women swathed in black and we think that they must be weak and trod upon all the time. And yet underneath that chador they can be pretty strong. And the thing that Americans always comment on is the clothing requirements. But when you talk to Iranian women about that, some chafe at that clothing requirement, but there are an awful lot who say that those rules don't really make a difference. They would always cover their hair anyway anytime they went out. In Isfahan I talked to a bunch of students who, as part of the school requirement, had to wear a chador. And there were some who were frustrated by the clothing requirement. But they also said that they really had more serious issues. I mean that they were concerned by other areas of inequality like job opportunities. And that Americans shouldn't be quite so preoccupied about clothing requirements. I'm not entirely sure I buy that, partly because I think the degree to which you have a few mullahs imposing their clothing taste on the entire nation, in such an intimate way determining what every woman does every day every time she goes out, that seems to me symbolic of the whole fundamental question of the Islamic revolution. Which is to what extent can a very few people impose their religious and social beliefs on an entire nation? PLAYING TOGETHER. KRISTOF. In Tehran, on a beautiful weekend day, I went to a park and there was a basketball court. And I was struck by the way young women and young men were playing basketball together. And the women were playing in full Islamic dress. They had their manteau and their head scarves on. But they'd take a jump shot and, bam, off would come the head scarf. And they'd play for 10-20 seconds and then they'd finally readjust it. And that is an issue for the morals police. They do periodically go and say: Hey, men and women shouldn't be playing together - break it up. But they tend to be more concerned in terms of clothing requirements about the men who wear shorts and who sometimes show their knees. One of the reassuring things about watching those people play basketball was that these young men and young women play together very naturally. And, you know, the men pass to the women, the women grab the rebounds, they play competitively. And it was a real contrast to the segregated society of Iran. You get some feeling of hope that increasingly men and women are able to really work together and cooperate and march through life together in a way that had not been true in the past. LASTEST FASHION TREND KRISTOF. One of the best indexes of change for women's dress in Iran is the clothing sold in the bazaars. In the Tehran bazaar I talked to a couple of people who were selling head scarves for women. And they said that the styles today are so different from what was permitted just a few years ago. And they showed the fashionable scarves today that instead of concealing women's hair and deadening any sex appeal are just enhancing it. In the Southern city of Shiraz I spoke to a seller of manteau, the outer garments that women are supposed to wear over their clothes. And manteau have just been transformed by the market and by what young people want. Now, of course, women are wearing jeans or other clothes underneath. Ayatollah Khomeini would just be rolling in his grave if he realized that people are now using Islamic dress to make women look sexier rather than to smother their sexuality. IRAN'S BABY BOOMERS KRISTOF. One of the central questions about Iran's future is whether baby boomers will change Iran in the same way that they changed America in the 1960's. Ayatollah Khomeini ordered Iranians to have more children after the Iranian revolution. And now he's kind of getting his comeuppance because there are 18 million young Iranians between the age of 15 and 25. And already you can see the way they're transforming social mores in Iran. A lot of what we associate with Iran isn't coming from the government. It's deeply embedded in the culture. And I mean nothing is more central to that notion than segregation of young men and young women. And boy, that is changing quickly. Young people are holding hands. They're just living a very different life - and scandalizing their parents while they're at it. AN ABSENCE OF FUN. KRISTOF. I went one evening to a shopping center in northern Tehran, which is a magnet for young people on dates. I mean of course the whole notion of dates is a very new idea. In speaking to some of these young couples, what really struck me was that what they yearned for wasn't so much democracy and a sense of political changes or a different kind of government or even necessarily freedom of speech, although I think all those things are important to them. But what they really want above all else is fun. One young woman really left an impression on me. Because she was 20 years old and she was talking about her frustrations. And she said: We want fun. There's no joy here. And I said: Look at you. You're showing your hair through a see-through scarf. You're sitting next to your boyfriend. You're wearing nail polish. And you're not being flogged. I mean you're a living demonstration about all the change and progress that have happened. And she answered that: I don't compare myself with 10 years ago. I compare myself to what I could have and don't. And I think that's a very frightening message for Iran's leadership. And I think that that lack of fun is really causing tremendous dissatisfaction with the regime itself. LONGING FOR KHOMEINI KRISTOF. I've asked a lot of people what they think about Khomeini. And I've been a little bit surprised by the way young people, for example, actually have positive views about Ayatollah Khomeini, who they don't really remember. But I say how can you - you know, if you're against this regime, which has really moderated since Khomeini's time, then how can you be in favor of Khomeini? And they say: Oh, Ayatollah Khomeini was very honest. He was different. He was willing to change. He was open-minded. So they've managed in a very interesting way to still honor the principle of the revolution in some cases and to honor the ideal of Ayatollah Khomeini, while regarding the present rulers as betrayers of that revolution. DOES IRAN HURT ISLAM? KRISTOF. One of the most sensitive and controversial questions that I've been asking people about: Is the Islamic Republic hurting Islam? Strangely, an awful lot of young Iranians say that it is. One young man that I met in Tehran, he said that the Islamic regime is so unpopular that it has made Islam unpopular as well. He apologized for having a beard. And he was embarrassed by it because beards are associated with the government and with these hard-line ayatollahs. IRANIAN MAN (captions). I'm sorry, I've been extremely busy and I haven't had the opportunity to shave. I don't want you to think that I'm a religious fanatic. KRISTOF. Even Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, who's one of the most senior clerics in the Shiite world, an architect of the Iranian revolution, he expressed precisely that concern. KRISTOF. Do you fear that all those frustrations are turning young people away from Islam itself and from the idea of clerical rule rather than just from this particular regime? AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI (captions). All this repression happening here is being done in the name of Islam. And the young people are being turned off to Islam because of it. The style of the gentlemen running the country has caused this. HYPOCRISY OF THE REPUBLIC KRISTOF. I spoke in the countryside to an old shepherd who can't even walk after his sheep. He sits on his donkey all day, every day, rain or shine and fights off the wolves. And he's very conservative and deeply Muslim, deeply faithful to Islam. But he was not a supporter of the Islamic revolution as I expected. And he said that it had been very disappointing and it had been a mistake. It had been better under the Shah. And his reasoning was that public order and public behavior had actually gone downhill. IRANIAN MAN (captions). I'm almost dead, so it doesn't matter what I think. All I need is two meters of earth to rest in. The mullahs aren't the problem. It's the people who are the problem. People today lie, cheat and steal. It was better under the Shah. KRISTOF. It used to be that if you didn't believe in strict Islam then you wouldn't wear Islamic dress. But now everybody does. And there's a sense that just the way people live is all for show. WILLING TO CHANGE KRISTOF. The mullahs naturally reject this interpretation that the Islamic revolution has been bad for Islam. I spoke to a young mullah and he said that he's not troubled by the fact young women are trying to show off more hair or wear body-hugging manteaus kind of thing. IRANIAN MAN (captions). All over the world there are religious questions, debate and disagreements. Young people will do things that young people do, like date and fall in love. You shouldn't take their behavior as a rejection of religion or the government. KRISTOF. In a lot of ways I think he's right. I think that the young people who do push the envelope in the way they dress, in the way they behave, they don't see themselves as going against Islam. Overwhelmingly I think they really want to be good Muslims. They just don't think that to be good Muslims they have to like this regime or wear black all the time. AN ANCIENT SUPERPOWER KRISTOF. Two thousand five hundred years ago the Persian empire was the superpower of its day. Now Iran is a dinky little country deeply frustrated by its isolation in the world. So the question is can Iran come back in from the cold? The Persian empire that Persepolis represents is very important I think in understanding Iran today. There's tremendous pride in the Persian past. And also a frustration at Iran's place in the world today. I mean how can it be that a country that once dominated much of the world is now this weak, poor power that has very tense relations with most of the world? That creates I think a lot of problems for the leadership today because of the expectations that the leaders can never meet. It's a comparison that they'll always fall short on. It also creates problems for the West because we have to deal with Iran in a way that won't inflame that sense of patriotism. In talking to young Iranians you constantly feel that prickliness, that sense of, Hey, who are you to bully Iran? Why are you guys telling us what to do? LUST FOR THE BOMB KRISTOF. The most sensitive area of all in Iran-U.S. relations in the coming months and years may well be the question of nuclear weapons. There is growing evidence that Iran is going all out to build nuclear weapons. There's been abundant evidence that has emerged that Iran's nuclear program is much more advanced than we thought, and that it might be able to build its first nuclear weapon as early as by the end of next year. The idea of Iran's rulers, who have frankly gotten away with murder through terrorism, having nuclear weapons is very frightening. So what should the U.S. do in terms of policy toward Iran? I think the greatest danger is that hard-liners in the U.S. will end up bolstering it and rescuing the hard-liners in Iran, that if we push too hard that is exactly what the mullahs would hope for. That will create a burst of patriotism around them and will keep them in power and will just cut the legs out from under the reformers in Iran. But on the other hand the Bush administration is absolutely right that the nuclear issue is an important one and we have to raise proliferation. But I think that we can raise it without bolstering the hard-liners. Part of that involves communicating relentlessly with Iranians through the satellite television stations that are broadcast from Los Angeles. You know, we have to reach out constantly and make it very clear that our target is only the regime, and especially the regime's squandering the country's resources on a nuclear program that is backfiring and causing more poverty and isolation for the country. THE FUTURE OF IRAN KRISTOF. In the minds of the ayatollahs, the ultimate authority in Iran is the Koran. But in the hearts of Iranians it's probably poetry instead. Iranian poets are beloved by everybody and read constantly. And maybe nobody more than the poet Hafiz. There's a traditional sort of method of fortune-telling where a bird selects some lines from Hafiz and then you interpret them to tell you the future. And the question I asked was what is Iran's future? The bird chose lines of poetry that translated ``Flower next to me and wine in the hand and love is on the way.'' Well, if the future of Iran is about flowers and wine and love, then I don't think it's in the hands of the mullahs. I think it's in the hands of the poets and the people. The regime here is so bankrupt and exhausted that unless the U.S. inadvertently bolsters it I think we're much more likely to see a pro-American democracy in Iran well before we see one in Baghdad. These six questions are just a start for a much broader discussion that we need to have about Iran. To dig a little bit deeper I'd suggest you click on the resources box. If you want to read more columns on Iran or other subjects there's a columns link. To comment on them you can click on the forum link where people discuss and debate my columns.

2004-05-20,ART: THE WYNNS' NEW SARGENT,"The Las Vegas casino owner Stephen A. Wynn and his wife, Elaine, spent $8.8 million at Sotheby's yesterday for one of John Singer Sargent's best-known portraits. ''Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife,'' from 1885, the second of three Sargent paintings of Stevenson, the Scottish novelist and poet, is unlike the more formal commissions that the artist is known for. It shows him in a velveteen jacket walking as he tweaks his mustache; his wife in Indian dress sitting in a chair may be glimpsed at the right of the canvas. Sargent gave the portrait to the Stevensons, who hung it in the living room of their house in Dorset, England. The painting comes from the Greentree Foundation, which has been selling portions of the fabled art collection first formed by Payne and Helen Hay Whitney and their son, John Hay Whitney, the financier and ambassador to Britain and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney. Records show that Mrs. Payne Whitney bought the painting at a sale of Stevenson's estate in 1914 and left it to her son. Mr. Wynn said yesterday that he planned to hang the painting in his new casino, the Wynn Las Vegas Resort and Country Club, scheduled to open in 2005.

2004-05-21,Why We Built the Ivory Tower,"After nearly five decades in academia, and five and a half years as a dean at a public university, I exit with a three-part piece of wisdom for those who work in higher education: do your job; don't try to do someone else's job, as you are unlikely to be qualified; and don't let anyone else do your job. In other words, don't confuse your academic obligations with the obligation to save the world; that's not your job as an academic; and don't surrender your academic obligations to the agenda of any non-academic constituency -- parents, legislators, trustees or donors. In short, don't cross the boundary between academic work and partisan advocacy, whether the advocacy is yours or someone else's.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/21/opinion/why-we-built-the-ivory-tower.html

2004-05-24,'The Wisdom of Crowds': Problem Solving Is a Team Sport," Generations of advertisers and business gurus have banked on the premises of Sigmund Freud's ''Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego,'' a slender volume with a big argument: when people assemble en masse, all the raw material making up the individual psyche (libido, aggression, whatever) is also present, but on a gigantic scale. And the power for rational thought is thereby dwarfed. The crowd is considerably dumber than its smartest members. This explains, for example, Britney Spears, irrational economic exuberance and the occasional episode of public yearning for an authority figure to do the superego's job, whether by seizing state power (the fascist dictator model) or by going on television to say ''You're fired'' (the reality TV version).

Along the way, at small rallies in restaurants and union halls, the brigade championed Kerry as a military hero and a steadfast leader. ''John Kerry saved our lives in Vietnam, and we saved his life,'' Del Sandusky, one of Kerry's former crewmates, told a crowd of about 20 people outside Macon's City Hall on a Sunday afternoon.

When La Toya London, a 25-year-old Anita Baker sound-alike, was voted out of the competition on May 12, Randy Jackson called it a ''travesty.'' In April, Simon Cowell, the most outspoken of the show's three judges (who pick the initial pool of contestants, but do not control the selection of a winner) told Entertainment Weekly, ''I'm over this year.'' And even Paula Abdul, the judge who never has a bad word to say, told Ellen DeGeneres during an interview that she cannot begin to predict who will emerge victorious on the season's final show, this Wednesday, because ''logic is thrown out the window.''",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/television-an-excess-of-democracy.html

Other planned improvements include: replacing the the overpass with one that is fully enclosed, heated and served by elevators; and building a new ticket office on the inbound platform with a restroom, air conditioning, concession stand and mosaic artwork. On the platforms, the canopy roofing will be replaced and the lighting improved. New benches, signage and a public address system will be installed, in addition to wheelchair access. The work is expected to take two years. Larchmont's original train station was torn down during the 1950's to make way for the New England Thruway, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman.

But her larger motivation was clear. Ms. Fromme has said -- and in his libretto for ''Assassins,'' the musical he wrote with Stephen Sondheim, John Weidman has reiterated -- that she committed the crime so that Charles Manson, whose ''family'' she had joined in 1967, would appear as a witness at her trial, and thus have a worldwide platform from which to preach his apocalyptic",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/theater/theater-the-tony-awards-letters-from-squeaky.html

An International Mining Geologist, received his doctorate in 1936 from the Royal Hungarian Joseph Nador University of Technical and Economical Sciences, in Budapest, Hungary. He authored a textbook and lectured extensively in his specialty of the coal industry. He was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and for 25 years, was the last General Manager of the Hungarian General Collierry Company, Limited. In 1956, the Government of Vienna, Austria recommended him to the Bureau of Mines in Washington, D.C. where he started his second career. This Bureau was the largest coal mining corporation and industrial enterprise in Central Europe. He made significant contributions in the development of coal, iron ore, and copper, in South America, Australia, and South Africa. His position as Vice President of Eisenberg and Company, a large international organization, took him to 19 countries on five continents, where he had a working knowledge of six languages. He was a member of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers Society, Mining and Exploration Society, and a senior member of the Society of Mining Engineers. In 1983, he was listed in the Who's Who in Mineral Engineering. In addition to his personal and professional achievements, he was a sensitive, G-d-fearing and honorable man, who was kind, considerate, and the personification of a gentleman. He gave his love, time, and boundless energy to his family, where he was looked up to as a father figure. Dr. Hammel was also a very generous man, and was deeply committed to the Park Avenue Synagogue, where he was a member for over 40 years, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the 92nd Street Y, and many other organizations which he supported anonymously. He is survived by his wife, Eszter Moritz Hammel, (his first wife of 49 years, Clara Rittersporn Hammel, passed away in 1996), his sister, Gabriella Noszlopi, his nephew, Prof. George Noszlopy, his great-nieces, Dr. Laura Noszlopy and Nina Noszlopy Williams, his great greatnephews, Matthew Noszlopy and Robert Williams, and the LeNard and Schweitzer families in Washington, D.C.

In a parallel universe, these acoustic-guitar laments and joyful digital dancehall tracks might reach beyond the reggae world, converting NPR listeners and XXL readers alike. As it is, this album is more likely to remain an underground hit, reaching fans who already cherish Ms. Stephens's pinched but expressive voice and earthy obsessions: one spoken-word piece describes a 10-second sexual encounter that ends in snores (his) and tears (hers). Still, Ms. Stephens deserves an award for recording one of 2004's best battle-of-the-sexes songs, ''Tek Him Back,'' in which a mistress realizes her mistake: ''Have a cute face, but him nah perform/ So tek him back, wifey tek him back.''",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/music-playlist-reggae-s-riddims-and-crews.html

White House officials say that Mr. Bush will talk about security, diplomacy, the rebuilding of Iraq and humanitarian aid. With fewer than six weeks to go, no one knows who will be running Iraq on July 1, but Mr. Bush insists it will not be the Americans.

In the space of a few months, 800,000 Tutsis and tens of thousands of Hutus died in an orchestrated campaign of violence, organized by Hutu extremists. Everyone from church workers to children became murderers. The killing even pitted members of the same family against one another. When the massacres stopped and the Hutu regime that sponsored them had been driven from power, Rwanda faced a task as least as complicated as mourning or forgetting -- the task of justice. The criminal justice system is so small that it would take many years to get through the entire caseload. So a system of local tribunals, or gacacas (pronounced ga-CHA-chas), was established, staffed by elders and people elected by their community and conducted in the open air of villages. Rather than focusing on retribution, these tribunals offered freedom or reduced sentences for those who confessed to their crimes.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/art-my-nightmare-my-neighbor.html

2004-05-24,"Oh Lad, Poor Lad","A new genre of commercial fiction, lad lit, was recently pronounced stillborn by Publishers Weekly, a mere month after its arrival had been announced by The New York Times and The Associated Press. Nothing stings quite so bitterly as cold numbers, so when the magazine printed that Nielsen BookScan had detected sales of only 1,716 copies of Kyle Smith's ''Love Monkey,'' an ostensible leader of the well-publicized ''trend,'' it had to hurt. An events planner at a Chicago bookstore chain was quoted saying that lad lit might attract women readers interested in ''spying on the other side, getting a look into the locker room,'' but she had to admit that the 10 stores in the chain she works for hadn't sold a single copy of either ''Love Monkey'' or another exemplar of the genre, Scott Mebus's ''Booty Nomad.''",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/books/the-last-word-oh-lad-poor-lad.html

2004-05-25,MEMO PAD,"STANDBY TO STANDBY -- Aviation and government officials are sounding the alarm: With air traffic approaching pre-2001 levels, get ready for worsening airport delays. ''Even though we are not yet into the summer months, typically the busiest for the airlines, we are already seeing delays and congestion resulting from the rebound in airline traffic,'' Kenneth M. Mead, the Department of Transportation inspector general, told a Senate committee last week. Because of intense low-fare airline competition at major airlines' hubs, some airports with high delay rates last summer will handle even more flights this summer, a report by the agency said. For example, Kennedy Airport, where 25.1 percent of flights were delayed last summer, has 20 percent more flights scheduled this summer. Washington Dulles, where 22.5 percent of flights were delayed last summer, has 17 percent more scheduled flights this summer.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/25/business/business-travel-memo-pad.html

He talked in general terms of expanding international involvement and stabilizing Iraq. But Mr. Bush was not starting fresh. He spoke after nearly 14 months of policy failures, none of them acknowledged by the president, which have left Iraq increasingly violent and drained Washington's credibility with the Iraqi people and the international community. They have been waiting for Mr. Bush to make a clean break with those policies. He did not do that last night. The speech reflected the fact that Mr. Bush has been backtracking lately, but he did not come close to charting the new course he needs to take.

It will take some serious study to recognize and understand the characters while you are waiting for your pot of tea, but in the end, you might be able to tell whether those stuffed buns are baked or steamed, and whether something called chicken legs is really chicken feet. Chinese characters are often more specific in describing dishes, and English translations are error-prone. For example, a dish called Two Crisp in English is actually pig tripe and dried squid.

2004-05-26,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: NextWave Settlement Approved,"NextWave Telecom has won approval of a settlement with federal regulators that resolves a dispute over a $4.3 billion debt for airwave licenses purchased at government auctions. NextWave agreed last month to return most of its spectrum licenses to the Federal Communications Commission and either give back other airwave rights or pay $386 million out of proceeds from their sale. The accord, approved by Judge Adlai S. Hardin Jr. of Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, gives mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless another opportunity to buy the licenses. ''I have been before you a lot of times in the past six years and there have been a lot of twists and turns in this case,'' a NextWave lawyer, Deborah Schrier-Rape, told Judge Hardin. ''We are here to end the problem that has governed NextWave for the past six years.'' The legal battle between NextWave and the commission culminated in a United States Supreme Court decision last year that allowed NextWave to keep the spectrum that the government reclaimed in 2000. NextWave owed the commission $4.3 billion out of $4.8 billion for the licenses won in auctions in 1996 and 1997 and the debt remained an obstacle to its successful reorganization. The company expects to submit a reorganization plan by July, said Michael Wack, a NextWave lawyer and spokesman.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-nextwave-settlement-approved.html

Clarke, said yesterday. The company recorded an expense for the potential settlement in its fourth-quarter results released yesterday, Mr. Clarke told reporters in Las Vegas. The company, based in Islandia, N.Y., said the government had not accepted nor rejected the offer. For the quarter, net income was $89 million, or 15 cents a share, bolstered by the sale of its Accpac International unit, compared with a loss of $106 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent, to $850 million. Earlier this month Computer Associates delayed releasing its results, saying it lacked enough time to compile them while investigating previous accounting practices. In April, the company restated its revenue in 2000 and 2001 by $2.2 billion after an internal investigation found sales were prematurely booked. The inquiry led to the firing of 14 executives. The chief executive, Sanjay Kumar, stepped down last month. Computer Associates said operating profit this quarter would be 17 to 19 cents a share, compared with analysts' average forecast of 19 cents, based on 14 estimates taken by Thomson First Call. Shares of Computer Associates fell to $24.93 in extended trading. Earlier, they were unchanged at $25.70 in regular trading.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/business/technology-briefing-software-computer-associates-offered-to-settle.html

Johnson, a visionary leader whose entrepreneurial spirit, deep commitment to his family, and loyalty to the University were extraordinary. A member of the Class of 1950 and a much - honored executive whose dedication to education and to the environment were legendary, he joined S.C. Johnson Inc. in 1954 and later became president and CEO. He championed policies of corporate philanthropy, community service, social responsibility, and a familyfriendly work life. He became a Cornell trustee in 1966 and served on numerous committees, and from 1990-1995 he co-chaired the campaign council during the University's capital campaign. He was a member of the Cornell University Council and served as a Presidential Councillor. In 1984, he and his family made the largest gift ever to a graduate school of business. As a result of his extraordinary generosity, the University named the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management in honor of his great grandfather who founded the family business in 1886. He chaired the advisory council at the Johnson School and, among many other thoughtful and wise investments, endowed a professorship in sustainable global enterprise in 2003. He was a benefactor of Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology and made innumerable gifts to support scholarships, campus life, and many other areas.

Andres was loved and respected by all those who were fortunate to know him during his full and interesting life. Happiest when surrounded by his five grandchildren: Olivia, Sabrina, and Marissa Wong, of Miami, FL; and Andrew and Jacqueline Chang, of Fresh Meadows, NY, he cherished his family and friends. Andres spent his early years in his hometown village of Toi San, in southern China. Fleeing the ravages of the Sino-Japanese conflict in 1939, he joined his brother Gustavo in Havana, Cuba. After finishing his studies and completing a stint as assistant secretary to the Chinese Ambassador in Venezuela, he returned to Havana where he established himself as an entrepreneur, owning and managing a food market in La Vibora, a suburb of Havana, and marrying Violeta Pons, the love of his life, with whom he shared fifty-one years of marriage. In 1960, Andres once again uprooted himself and his family to seek ideological and economic freedom away from Fidel Castro's oppressive regime, this time making one final and decisive journey to New York City. After a persistent and laborious start, he simultaneously built up a soy and rice products business, while developing a strong presence in NYC's Chinatown community. He served several terms as President of the CubanChinese Association as well as the Toi San High School Alumni Association, engaging their members in many charitable and communityoriented activities. Having touched the hearts and minds of many, Andres will be dearly missed. The family will receive friends at Wah Wing Sang Funeral Home at 26 Mulberry St. in New York City on Monday, May 31st.

Asked To Investigate Diocese,"Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group based in Washington, has called on the Internal Revenue Service to investigate whether the Roman Catholic Diocese of Colorado Springs violated the law by endorsing political candidates.

Expect to make liberal use of the Fastpass kiosks (the system, which is available on many of the most-popular rides and shows, gives you an assigned window of time in which to ride without waiting in line). And forget seeing it all.

The Board of Directors, officers, and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta are deeply saddened by the loss of Robert P. Forrestal, former president and chief executive officer. He died of cancer on May 26 at the age of 72. A native of New York City and graduate of St. John's University, he studied in France on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1953, beginning an interest in international affairs that he applied throughout his career. He later served as an officer in the U.S. Naval Intelligence, with tours of duty in Morocco, Italy, and Great Britain. Upon discharge, he earned a law degree from Georgetown, and soon joined the Federal Reserve System, where he spent most of his professional life. After six years at the Board of Governors in Washington, DC, in 1970 he joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta as general counsel. He later served as first vice president and chief operating officer before becoming president and CEO from 1983 to 1995. Mr. Forrestal was a member of the Fed's monetary policy making body, the FOMC, and led the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta during a period of rapid change in the banking industry and the economy. To deal with these challenges, he strengthened the Altanta Fed's research and supervisory functions while maintaining the Bank's operational efficiency in processing checks, cash, and other payments. He also increased understanding of international economics and finance, giving numerous speeches around the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe, often in French, Italian or Spanish. Throughout his career he was active in community service, and served on numerous boards, including those of various hospitals, universities, and other nonprofits. To his wife, Wilma Anderson Forrestal, his daughter, Renee Spoerer, and three grandsons, Robbie, Nicholas, and Thomas, we extend our condolences.

2004-05-31,"Saudi Commandos Free Hostages, Ending Standoff With Militants"," KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, May 30 - Saudi commandos in helicopters stormed an upscale residential complex in this oil center on Sunday, freeing most of the dozens of Westerners and other foreigners who had been trapped by four armed militants in the compound's hotel for 24 hours. The militants killed 22 people, the Interior Ministry announced, including one American. Twenty-five people were wounded, according to a ministry statement carried by the official Saudi press agency. It also said the militants began the siege of the compound by vaulting over a fence, after their attempt to drive a car booby-trapped with explosives into the compound had failed. The militants' leader was critically wounded and captured, the statement said, but three other gunmen - holding hostages at gunpoint - used them as cover to escape in a stolen car. It was unclear what happened to those hostages, but checkpoints set up on major highways around this city on the Persian Gulf were examining all cars. The attack on Saturday on the luxurious complex, known as the Oasis Residential Resorts, was the second brazen assault this month against the Saudi oil industry, which is heavily dependent on foreigners, and statements of responsibility attributed to Al Qaeda quickly appeared on Arab Islamist Web sites. Moreover, the attack came as Saudi Arabia is trying to increase production to ease pressure on record global oil prices. The psychological impact of the Oasis attack on the major oil markets in New York and London, which are closed on Monday, remained to be seen. In the tense finale of the Oasis attack, the Saudi commandos were shown on television leaping from helicopters onto the roof of a building in the compound. The victims included nine people killed in or around the Oasis residential resort, the luxurious guesthouse which includes amenities like an ice-skating rink. The militants had held the resort overnight, apparently picking off victims as they encountered them. ``They were found all over the place, some of them in the corridors and others near the entrance and some on the steps,'' said one Saudi eyewitness.. He said most appeared to be either Indian or Filipino, except for two Westerners. Details of the assault and the mopping up operation remained murky. The Saudi Interior Ministry statement said 41 hostages were rescued by the commandos, but a Western diplomat explained that they were not all held together in the hotel, a five-story building constructed around a courtyard swimming pool. The diplomat said some had been hiding to avoid being killed by the gunmen who seized the place. ``The gunmen were going through the compound and either shooting people or letting them go, they shot non-Muslims and they let the Muslims go,'' the Western diplomat said. The Oasis attack was the first large-scale assault in the heart of the kingdom's oil producing region along the Persian Gulf, and followed a similarly brazen assault on foreign oil workers in the Saudi city of Yanbu on May 1. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and other senior government officials sought to reassure world oil markets that production continued uninterrupted. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Nuaimi, was reportedly meeting with Western officials and oil company executives to reassure them that the attacks would not affect oil supplies. ``The terrorists' goal is to disrupt the Saudi economy and destabilize our country,'' Prince Bandar said in a statement released in Washington. ``But they will not succeed. With every desperate act of violence, our effort and resolve to destroy the terrorists only grows.'' Prince Bandar also told Fox television news that seven Americans had been rescued from the compound. Diplomats in the kingdom said he was referring to seven American government personnel who lived on the compound and had managed to elude detection by the militants, although two of them suffered gunshot wounds that were not life threatening. The total of 242 people evacuated from the Oasis compound - also home to executives for such leading firms as Royal Dutch/Shell, Total and Lukoil - were taken to either hospitals or nearby hotels, depending on their condition. A group affiliated with Al Qaeda, the network whose founder, Osama bin Laden, has vowed to disrupt the close ties between the kingdom and the West, claimed responsibility for the attack through an unsubstantiated claim on a Web site associated with the militants. It threatened to drive all ``crusaders'' from ``the land of Islam.'' In a taped statement posted on Islamist Web sites, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, a reputed leader of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, promised that the coming months would be ``bloody and miserable for infidels.'' Saudi and other analysts suggest that it is likely that Qaeda admirers, rather than the organization itself, were responsible. Much like the bloody assault in Yanbu, which left six Westerners and a Saudi dead, the Oasis attack against compounds or office complexes used mainly by Westerners appeared designed to create maximum carnage. That suggests that the terrorists are getting weaker, rather than stronger, the analysts believe, because they are unable to attack anything substantial. A crackdown launched after three suicide bombing attacks killed 35 people in Riyadh last May, including the bombers, has seriously hampered their ability to organize. ``It reflects a late stage in the life of these groups because when they are very weak, they choose very easy targets with very bloody results,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, an expert on Saudi affairs at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic studies in Cairo. ``They want something that causes the maximum propaganda and media impact to try to show that they are strong.'' Before hitting the Oasis complex, the attackers had opened fire at the Al-Khobar Petroleum Center building, which houses the offices of numerous Western firms, and shot their way through another building used by Apicorp, the Arab Petroleum Investment Corporation. An Egyptian schoolboy was among those killed there. ``These targets are not strategic, they did not attack oil fields for example, so it has no affect on the grip of the Saudi royal family,'' Mr. Abu Taleb noted. Such strikes mean that the level of violence may not drop any time soon, as there are literally thousands of places for anyone with a gun to shoot at Westerners in the kingdom. Expatriate residents of the Eastern Province, where the kingdom's oil production is centered, said they expect a large exodus of at least families once the school year ends. The American Embassy repeated its April 15 warning that all Americans should depart the kingdom. Many Saudis expressed revulsion over the attacks, but there were a few gloating messages on extremist Web sites that some of the militants had been able to elude capture. Khobar had been the site of a terrorist attack in 1996, when 19 American servicemen died from a massive truck bomb that sheared off the face of their apartment building. In hindsight it was labeled a Qaeda attack. Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's actual ruler in the face of King Fahd's longstanding infirmity, reiterated the kingdom's determination to stamp out the extremists. In the short run, analysts said, they are aided by the fact that each such attack tends to convince people to unite around the ruling family. But in the long run, police operations alone won't work because the extremists are rooted in the same Wahabi religious tenets as the family. ``The security solution is not enough, these are ideological groups who want to topple the regime itself,'' said Abdel Rahman al-Lahem, a Saudi lawyer and expert in Islamist movements. The tradition of leaving public discourse up to the religious alone has to be abandoned for a broader base, he suggested. The extremists were evidently returning to attacking Westerners because their recent attacks-including a car-bombing in Riyadh in April and an attack on a compound there last November-had mostly killed Saudis and other Muslims. The Saudi Interior Ministry said the dead included one American, eight Indians, one Briton, two Sri Lankans, one Egyptian child, one Swede, one Italian, one South African, three Filipinos and three Saudis. Barrie Peach, the spokesman for the British Embassy, identified the dead Briton as Michael Hamilton, 61, who had spent 25 years working in the region and was vice president for projects at Apicorp, one of the businesses attacked Saturday. The Italian foreign ministry identified their dead citizen as Antonio Amato, 25, who had arrived in the kingdom in recent weeks to work as a cook at the Oasis complex.

The striking $3.5 million structure, whimsically shaped like a dinosaur's three-toed footprint, is in the village of Colunga, 20 miles from Gijón and 25 miles from Oviedo. It overlooks the Atlantic beaches of Griega and Lastres, where many dinosaur tracks have been preserved. The 130-mile stretch of sandy beaches and dramatic cliffs is so rich in tracks and bones from the Jurassic period that it has been dubbed the Dinosaur Coast.

2004-05-31,A Really Open Election,"This fall, as many as 20 percent of American voters will be able to cast their ballots on A.T.M.-style electronic voting machines. But to put it mildly, these machines -- where you simply touch a screen and a computer registers your vote -- have not inspired much confidence lately. North Carolina officials recently learned that a software glitch destroyed 436 e-ballots in early voting for the 2002 general election. In a Florida state election this past January, 134 votes apparently weren't recorded -- and this was in a race decided by a margin of only 12 votes. Since most of the machines don't leave any paper trail, there's no way to determine what actually happened. Most alarmingly, perhaps, California's secretary of state recently charged that Diebold -- the industry leader -- had installed uncertified voting machines and then misled state officials about it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-5-30-04-idea-lab-a-really-open-election.html

2004-05-31,The Saint and the Satirist,"SAINTS are perhaps always best evoked by sinners. And it would be hard to think of someone more at ease in the world of modern sin than Tony Hendra. He is and has been a brilliant satirist, an alum of National Lampoon in its glory days, an architect of the peerless parody rock documentary, ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' a man who has known (and tells us of) serial sex and drugs and rock and irony. But this extraordinary, luminescent, profound book shows us something wonderfully unexpected and deeply true. These ideas of sin that we have are not really sin. Or rather: they are the symptoms of sin, not its essence. And its essence is our withdrawal -- our willful withdrawal -- from God's love. This book is about Hendra's slow, aching, hilarious but profound attempt to accept God's unconditional love for him. And this truly difficult acceptance is a consequence of one other man's quiet listening and faith. Of another's love.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/books/the-saint-and-the-satirist.html

2004-05-31,Idi Amin and Worse,"Like Moses Isegawa's first novel, ''Abyssinian Chronicles,'' SNAKEPIT (Knopf, $24) is a depiction of Uganda in the 1970's, during Idi Amin's brutal and chaotic rule. The interlocking stories of three characters, each of whom takes advantage of the state of lawlessness, make up the narrative. There's Bat Katanga, fresh from graduate school in Britain; his boss, General Bazooka, who is, like the illiterate Amin, from the less developed north; and the British-born mercenary Robert Ashes, a latecomer to Amin's wild ride, who as the president's confidant becomes one of General Bazooka's rivals. Isegawa's hurtling style and tone of outraged helplessness convey the vertiginous atmosphere of the Ugandan free-for-all. Some readers may regret that he sometimes adds his own exaggerations to the already nearly incredible historical record. For instance: Amin did voluntarily appear as the subject of a documentary that captured much of his insanity; he did not, as in the novel, star in two biographical films in which he played Il Duce. And in the most ghastly scene in the book, when one of Ashes' henchmen (known as the Pounder) kills the wife of a British businessman, the mode of execution -- it is carried out with a ''meter-long pestle'' -- is the stuff of pulp horror stories. Despite this, ''Snakepit'' remains a considerable achievement, an insider's viscerally imagined dramatization of the monumental and horrific follies of that particular time and place.

2004-05-31,'Port Mungo'," When he first came back to New York, and that would be twenty years ago now, my brother Jack was in a kind of stupor, for it was shortly after the death of his daughter Peg. What can you say about the death of a child? She was sixteen when it happened, and the impact on all of us, Jack of course in particular, was devastating. When I glimpsed the extent of his grief, after the first shock wore off, and he awoke to the grim slog of flat, empty days that yawned before him-all meaning, hope and pleasure drained from life-I called out to him from across what seemed a chasm, and got back only the faintest of answers, which might have been no more than an echo; I mean I did not know what to say to him to bring him back into living contact with the world, and more immediately with myself, his sister.

2004-05-31,New & Noteworthy,"THE KNOWN WORLD, by Edward P. Jones. (Amistad/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Transforming a little-known historical footnote into an epic novel with few certified villains or heroes, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel goes right to the heart of slavery as it tells of a black slave owner in 1850's Virginia, and a multitude of other characters who survive by negotiating mazes of moral contradiction. Chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2003, ''The Known World'' shows how slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows for the odd act of decency. ''Jones has an exceptional ear for speech now buried in the past,'' and ''the freshness of his story lies in its very incongruity and strangeness,'' John Vernon wrote in these pages.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/books/new-noteworthy.html
