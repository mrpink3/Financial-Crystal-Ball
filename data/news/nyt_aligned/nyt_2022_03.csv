Nearly a fourth of Americans claimed to have eaten less meat in 2019, according to a Gallup poll. The recipe site Epicurious, which reaches an audience of 10 million, phased out beef as an ingredient in new recipes in 2020. Diners at some McDonald’s can now sate their lust for a Quarter Pounder with a vegan McPlant instead. Faux meat products are projected to reach $85 billion in sales by 2030, according to a recent study by UBS, and Tyson Foods, one of the biggest beef packers in the United States, has hedged its bets by introducing its own plant-based line.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/t-magazine/meat-beef-vegetarianism-veganism.html

2022-03-04,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"I was on my way to the doctor’s office this morning when a large truck ran a light and smacked into the driver’s side of my car. I’m fine — all the damage was to the unoccupied back end, thank goodness — but it’s put me into one of those strange middle-aged moods where the colors look brighter and life feels hallowed and precarious in exactly the way the great writers tell us it is; sometimes it takes the crunch of metal to drive that home, and sometimes it takes nothing more than words and characters and stories on a page. If you’re looking for the lesson without the adrenaline, you might pick up a new nonfiction book by Chris Lockhart and Daniel Mulilo Chama called “Walking the Bowl,” which follows a murder investigation among the street children of Lusaka, Zambia. That’s one of our recommendations this week. Also up: new novels by Sheila Heti and Marlon James and the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk (among others), along with an account of PayPal’s consequential origins and counterintuitive histories of the American presidents Richard Nixon and Abraham Lincoln.

These devotees typically adhere to Browne’s proportional dictates for his signature shrunken 1950s-inspired tailoring: The trousers should be hemmed short, rising two or three inches above sockless black leather brogues; their cuffs should likewise approach three inches. The matching three-button jacket, cut high in the armholes — both broadening the shoulders and discouraging bad posture — should be fastened only once, snugly around the rib cage, from which the blazer should skim six inches over the pants’ waist. Its truncated sleeves should reveal an inch of white shirt cuffs underneath, and don’t forget the white pocket square, which “should be ironed, and stick out only one-third inch,” as one guide published by the brand explains.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/t-magazine/thom-browne-gray-flannel-suit.html

The name refers to the former Del Posto and Daniel chef Melissa J. Rodriguez, who is partnering with Jeff Katz and James Kent of Crown Shy and Saga to develop this sprawling space. (Al Coro, a lavish Italian restaurant, and Discolo, a lower-level lounge, will open in the Del Posto space in early summer.) Mel’s is done warmly in orange tones and polished light wood, a bar and a dining counter open into a rear dining room, and a huge wood-fired pizza oven is central to the space. “Everything is cooked with wood,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “There’s no gas here.” The pizzas start with Margherita but quickly veer into creative territory: mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and shaved shallots; and kale, basil pesto, ricotta and preserved lemon. Many appetizers, like roasted parsnips with robiola cheese, roasted maitake mushrooms with soppressata piccante, and charred shrimp, are wood fired, as are mains like whole fish, whole roasted cauliflower and strip steak. Unlike at most pizzerias, dessert is neither an afterthought nor skippable. Consider milk chocolate gelato with dark chocolate sable swirl; salted caramel and fior di latte gelato with caramel sauce and shortbread crumble; or an Italian rainbow cookie hot fudge sundae, a tribute to Little Italy. The timing of the opening is calculated so that Ms. Rodriguez, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has several months to get Mel’s in order before Al Coro is unveiled.

Some look to the propagandistic Clinton-hating conspiracies of the 1990s as the moment things started to change. Others blame the 9/11 truthers, or the original autism-related anti-vaccine panic. In her persuasive and heartbreaking new book, Elizabeth Williamson points to the horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, when 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School were killed, and then a host of internet trolls set out to convince the world it didn’t happen.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/books/review/sandy-hook-elizabeth-williamson.html

The script called for her to channel nearly a decade of experience as a martial artist into the character of Ah Kam, a stunt woman working her way into the film industry. This scene was crucial: As Ah Kam hesitated over the performance of a daunting on-camera stunt, the character played by Sammo Hung, a legend of kung fu cinema, would push her, and she would fall over the ledge onto the bed of a passing truck. “When it’s an easy stunt,” Yeoh says, “that’s when things can really go wrong.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/magazine/michelle-yeoh-everything-everywhere-all-at-once.html

When, in the early months of the pandemic, Oliver, 48, began making sourdough bread for Bessie’s family, with whom they were staying in London, it wasn’t long before he graduated to baguettes and croissants, producing them in such quantities that he briefly considered opening a bakery (instead, he delivered his surplus to friends around the city). That spring, away from their jobs and home in New York, the pair also thought about updating their apartment, a 2,000-square-foot duplex in Greenwich Village. But what began as a plan to simply repaint the walls evolved, when they returned to Manhattan that summer, into an all-encompassing renovation — one they completed entirely themselves. “We both have this obsessive world in our brains,” says Bessie, 35. “It’s a little dangerous.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/t-magazine/arje-apartment-home-design.html

And so, rather than an architectural afterthought, as these hard-working spaces so often are, the two bathrooms became an expression of the family’s vision for life in their new home — and of the distinctly British, often fantastical aesthetic of Buchanan Studio, the creative direction and interior design company the couple founded in 2018.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/t-magazine/bathrooms-home-design-london.html

The latest take, directed by Gail Lerner with a screenplay by Jenifer Rice-Genzuk Henry and the “black-ish” creator Kenya Barris, bears virtually no resemblance to the source material: Instead of a husband-and-wife duo of industrial engineers living in New Jersey with a dozen biological children, this “Cheaper” tells the story of the Bakers, Paul (Zach Braff) and Zoe (Gabrielle Union), who own a popular Los Angeles diner and share a home with their adopted son, a teenage nephew, two sets of twins and a slew of kids from previous marriages.

You could hear Philip Glass’s “Music in 12 Parts” at Leo Castelli Gallery, or Meredith Monk’s a cappella ululations at the Walker Art Center. Composers and artists collaborated with ease — La Monte Young wrote compositions for the sculptor Robert Morris; Glass assisted Richard Serra in the creation of his early splashes of lead — and the very distinction between new art and new music could be hazy: the Fluxus artists Nam June Paik, George Maciunas, Allan Kaprow and Yoko Ono were all trained in music composition.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/arts/design/camille-norment-dia-chelsea.html

2022-03-17,8 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Disruption! Chaos! Pandemonium! It’s not much fun to live through, but in hindsight it can make for pretty good copy — so it’s not surprising to find, at the center of this week’s recommended titles, that the center doesn’t hold. NoViolet Bulawayo’s new novel, “Glory,” is all about political turmoil. Yoko Tawada’s latest, “Scattered All Over the Earth,” is about climate apocalypse. Two new biographies of Buster Keaton make the case that he was not only a comic genius but also a technological disrupter, madly innovating new directions for the film industry in its early days. And in “Origin,” Jennifer Raff sets out to overturn some long-held theories about the first humans to populate the Americas. Things fall apart. That’s the message of “The Quiet Before,” by Gal Beckerman (until recently my colleague at the Book Review), about social movements building from the ground up, and it’s the premise (in a very different way) of “The Old Woman With the Knife,” Gu Byeong-mo’s novel about a 65-year-old female assassin in Seoul. Meanwhile, disruption of another sort — aesthetic, existential — is at the core of the Swedish writer Jon Fosse’s seven-novel series “Septology,” about an aging painter arguing with God.

Those seem to be among the few points of consensus when it comes to what the historian Peter N. Stearns calls a “disputed emotion.” Unlike fear or anger, shame is “self-conscious”; it doesn’t erupt so much as coil around itself. It requires an awareness of others and their disapproval, and it has to be learned. Aristotle thought of it as fundamental to ethical behavior; Confucius saw it as essential to social order.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/books/shame-machine-cathy-oneil.html

2022-03-21,Anaïs Nin’s Los Angeles Hideaway Still Keeps Her Secrets,"AMONG MANY WRITERS, there’s a commonly held belief that a desk must be organized, an office must be tidy, an entire home must be cleaned, before one can finally sit down and fill the empty pages before them. One can’t help but think of such habits — the physical manifestation of routine and discipline — when visiting the completely preserved home of the midcentury French American eroticist Anaïs Nin, who died at 73 in 1977 in Los Angeles. Here, hidden among pines overlooking the Silver Lake neighborhood’s reservoir, Nin envisioned a low, single-story aerie, which she called her “one large studio, no separate, small partitions.” This description appeared in the first edition of her diary (originally published in 1966), which she began writing at 11 as a child traveling to America from the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and continued until her death. Today, there are 18 volumes — with a final one left unpublished — comprising an oeuvre that also includes frank, feminist, sexually explicit, oft-censored essays about her various lovers; literary criticism (the English writer D.H. Lawrence was a favorite); and beloved works of fiction like “House of Incest” (1936) and “Delta of Venus” (1977), many of which she initially printed herself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/t-magazine/anais-nin-los-angeles-home.html

2022-03-21,‘Six California Kitchens’ Details the Cooking Life of Sally Schmitt,"How bittersweet it is to stroll through Sally Schmitt’s hefty new memoir-cookbook, “Six California Kitchens.” It’s the first cookbook by the California cuisine trailblazer, who died about two weeks ago at 90, just one month shy of the book’s release (April 5). Available for pre-order, it’s a timely memorial, tracing her life in California through the kitchens she experienced and ran. Notably, there’s the French Laundry, which she and her husband, Don, originally owned from 1978 to 1994, when Thomas Keller took over. The first kitchen in the book was her mother’s, the final one Elk Cottage, in Mendocino, Calif., where the Schmitts retired and she cooked for the two of them. The recipes woven throughout are almost book ended by the simplest from her mother: potatoes simmered then roasted to a crisp with a mustard slather; and sausages in hard cider, a two-ingredient marvel. The book, illustrated with photographs and memorabilia, is filled with often inventive but always ingredient-driven dishes, including many for duck. Some are written with step-by-step directions — two pages for a turkey sandwich! — that convey a sense that Ms. Schmitt is at your side offering handy tips. Her French Laundry recipes are pulled from daily five-course menus: warm salad of sweetbreads and mushrooms; roasted rib-eye of veal; and rhubarb mousse, nothing precious. Also described are the Vintage Café, the Chutney Kitchen and the Apple Farm, where teaching and catering mostly replaced nightly dinners. At the end she covers basics, like making stock, using eggs and filling the pantry.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/dining/sally-schmitt-six-california-kitchens.html

I had never heard of Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog” until Sam Elliott decided that it does not qualify as a cowboy movie. Elliott is one of those character actors who seem to have subsumed his core identity into the roles he has played in dozens of movies and television shows. It is cool to lust for Elliott — gruff, masculine, western, small-c conservative, with a mustache made for pornography — or, rather, for the type of masculinity he performs. Women and gay men and nonbinary people frequently remark on his appeal. While that appeal might have a daddy-issues vibe, it is also nostalgic for an old-school movie star masculinity that was problematic in its own time (the patriarchal colonialism!) and that has been now defanged in the #MeToo era.

He spent much of his weekends, however, a few miles northwest in Notting Hill, browsing at Portobello Market, which consists of a mile-long string of street vendors who have been congregating there since the late 1860s, and which, thanks to the so-called rag and bone men — essentially, cart-wielding junk dealers — has over the last eight decades evolved into an epicenter for antiques and eccentric bric-a-brac. Eventually, Karavil’s frequent excursions, as well as the neighborhood’s vibrant atmosphere, spurred him to look for a place in Notting Hill. First, he put an offer on a three-story London villa, but then he saw an apartment that spanned two floors of a stucco-fronted townhouse built in the mid-19th century. Though it needed considerable love, he knew, largely thanks to an original marble fireplace with neo-Classical corbel detailing and an unusual wrought-iron spiral staircase, that it was where he wanted to be.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/t-magazine/notting-hill-home-design.html

2022-03-25,How Should Art Reckon With Climate Change?,"NOT LONG AFTER he joined the Princeton University Art Museum in 2006, the curator Karl Kusserow wore a bracelet bearing the phrase “Stop global warming” to a staff meeting. His colleagues noticed (“It was,” he conceded, “kind of ugly and noticeable”), but only a few of them knew it referred to a cause. The term was just getting mainstream traction — this was the year Al Gore released “An Inconvenient Truth” and Vanity Fair launched its first Green issue. But the science suggesting that industrial societies have thrown climatic rhythms wildly out of whack had been around for decades. Just a year earlier, the environmentalist Bill McKibben had railed against the culture’s perceived indifference. “Where are the books? The poems? The plays? The goddamn operas?” he wrote in an op-ed for Grist. “Compare it to, say, the horror of AIDS … which has produced a staggering outpouring of art that, in turn, has had real political effect.” For future generations looking back on the present, “the single most significant item will doubtless be the sudden spiking temperature. But they’ll have a hell of a time figuring out what it meant to us.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/t-magazine/art-climate-change.html

2022-03-25,A Teardrop Locket Inspired by a Parisian Flea Market Find,"Like so many first-generation Americans, the jewelry designer Monica Rich Kosann has always felt deeply connected to the past. Raised on Manhattan’s Upper East Side by an Austrian mother and a Hungarian father, she spent her childhood days wandering through museums and art galleries with her family. As a student at LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, Kosann would head downtown after class to rummage through antiques stores. At 16, the gift of a Rollei film camera from her father changed her life. Inspired by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, she spent the next two decades taking portraits of friends and acquaintances. Her love of old, beautiful things never faded, and she amassed in that time “about a gazillion” Art Deco cigarette cases, powder compacts, Victorian lockets and minaudières from the early 1900s, which she acquired at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen in Paris, along Portobello Road in London and down Vienna’s cobblestone side streets. Kosann would insert her photos into what she called “image cases,” and give them as presents to friends, and by 2003, she launched her namesake line of sterling silver photo boxes. She eventually expanded into jewelry, offering oval filigree lockets, enamel vermeil zodiac charms and stackable gold bands that riff on 15th-century poesy rings.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/t-magazine/monica-rich-kosann-necklace.html

2022-03-29,Why I Love Erotic Thrillers,"I can trace my fascination with erotic thrillers back to the 1998 Neve Campbell and Denise Richards vehicle “Wild Things.” My father and I watched it together at his suggestion (there was never much censorship in my bohemian Manhattan childhood home), and as a burgeoning teen cinephile I was enchanted by its polished, artful sleaze. The plot concerns Campbell (brunette, surly, poor) and Richards (blonde, popular, wealthy), who accuse their high-school guidance counselor of abuse. Soon, the story becomes a thicket of convoluted double crosses, and nothing is what it originally seemed. By the time the end credits rolled and revealed Campbell as the film’s criminal mastermind, I was ready to cheer. Like many of the most captivating women in these films, Campbell’s character is an outsider who uses others’ underestimation of her abilities to her advantage. Fooled by her lower-class status, her enemies think she lacks savvy, but she is in fact a cunning strategist who uses her sexuality to outwit them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/magazine/erotic-thrillers-recommendation.html

We’re constantly looking for one another out in the world — to find love, avoid danger, connect — so much so that we often see a face where there isn’t one. “You only need this minimal information to see a face because it’s more adaptive to make a mistake and see a funny face in a cloud than to miss a real human face,” says Wardle, who works at the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institute of Mental Health.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/magazine/how-to-see-faces-everywhere.html

I learned that more cases than usual were being reported in a city in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where skirmishes between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian Army had left the area war-ravaged long before the full-scale invasion currently strangling the country. A gynecologist in Avdiivka, a suburb of Donetsk, told The New York Times that the uptick in cases was most likely due to a combination of stress and heavy lifting; damage to pipes and other infrastructure forced residents to carry pails of water up flights of stairs. One woman with the condition, Liudmila, said she now had to decide between an expensive medical procedure and repairing her roof, which had been destroyed by shelling. “The winter is coming,” she said, “and I am going to stay either without a roof over my head or with my uterus falling out.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/books/review/belorusets-kurkov-lucky-breaks-grey-bees.html
