Hughes published these collections while a student at Lincoln University, and he released “Not Without Laughter” in 1930, shortly after graduating. “By the date of his first book of prose Hughes had become for many a symbol of the black renaissance,” Bontemps writes.

My memories of lessons begin when I was 4, in the grand, echoey pool of the middle school that I was years away from attending. Through much cajoling by the amicable teenage instructors, I had overcome my initial fears and could jump into the pool unassisted, provided that someone was waiting to catch me. Soon I had graduated from arm floats and could splash my way from edge to edge with confidence, the aquatic tiles flying beneath me. I liked swimming because it rewarded dumb action: the more movement, the better.

Out of the car hops an irritated hipster dirtbag, cussing up a storm. The only house nearby looks just like the one in the 1974 version of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and suggests that its owners have received some sort of expansion loan.

2018-01-05,Before Sue Grafton Was a Star,"ABC: The crime novelist Sue Grafton, who died on Dec. 28, often seemed like a permanent fixture of the best-seller lists. Her alphabetically titled mysteries about the private eye Kinsey Millhone spent something like 400 weeks on the lists over all, and 10 of those books (beginning with “L Is for Lawless,” in 1995) entered at No. 1. So it comes as a surprise to learn that Grafton didn’t have a best seller until the series was eight years old and six books along, when “F Is for Fugitive” finally cracked the paperback list in 1990. “When I started writing the series, who even knew this was going to work?” Grafton told the critic and editor Sarah Weinman in a 2009 interview for The Los Angeles Times. That was the year that “U Is for Undertow” came out, and Weinman asked whether Grafton felt any pressure to make it all the way to Z. “For the first half of the alphabet, people bet I couldn’t,” Grafton replied. “Now, they are rooting for me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/books/review/sue-grafton-best-seller.html

2018-01-09,Learning to Fool Our Algorithmic Spies,"In a series of studies published in 2012, two psychologists, Ara Norenzayan and Will Gervais, set out to test a simple question: When people think about God, do they feel or act as if they are being monitored? Subjects of varying religiosity were primed to think about God, then asked to complete self-evaluations based on statements like “I am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me” and “No matter whom I’m talking to, I’m always a good listener.” Results, researchers said, were consistent with what they call the “supernatural-monitoring hypothesis” — that is, that “thinking of God triggers the same social cognitive processes that are activated by real-time social surveillance.” A sense that you’re being seen — whether by a fellow human or by a supreme consciousness from which no thought can be withheld — does seem to change how you see yourself as well as how you behave.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/magazine/learning-to-fool-our-algorithmic-spies.html

The prehistoric Venus of Willendorf is round, but mostly at the breasts and hips. The Venus de Milo’s missing arms only make her curves more visible. Even the knee length tresses of Botticelli’s Venus fail to conceal her shape. Bounce forward 500 years, and the actress Uma Thurman poses nude, a towering hourglass, in the same oyster shell in “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.” Some version of this form — white, voluptuous, exposed — is eternally present in our culture, on billboards, on screens, everywhere. This is “sexy,” or at least its usual shorthand. One designed, mainly, by and for straight white men: the fruit of the “male gaze” that the film theorist Laura Mulvey described in 1975, which “projects its fantasy on to the female figure, which is styled accordingly.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/magazine/who-decides-whats-sexy-and-who-pays-for-it.html

2018-01-11,Review: ‘Vazante’ Revisits Brazil’s History in Black and White,"“Vazante” is an origin story written in bile and ornamented with reluctant beauty. It takes place in southeastern Brazil in 1821 — some six decades before the abolition of slavery — on a squalid farm deep in the mountains. There, a white drover turned farmer, Antonio (Adriano Carvalho), is trying to make a go of it on the backs of enslaved black men, women and children. He’s failed to cultivate the land, blaming it for his defeat, and seems equally terrible at everything else. Soon after the movie opens, his wife and baby die during labor, a tragedy that suggests that here life itself is doomed from the start.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/movies/vazante-review-daniela-thomas.html

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., though most associated with the South, had deep ties to New York City, dating back to the fall of 1950, when he served as a student pastor every other month at the First Baptist Church in East Elmhurst, Queens. The senior pastor there gave him a B for “pulpit ability,” knocking him for “aloofness.” That would change. The city almost saw the end of his career as well: at a 1958 book signing in Harlem, a woman named Izola Ware Curry stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, convinced that Dr. King and others in the movement were plotting against her (she was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane). Dr. King remembered the incident in his “I Have Been to the Mountaintop” speech a day before his death, noting that if he had sneezed while the blade was in him, he would not have survived to see the gains of the movement he led. “I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze,” he said.",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/what-martin-luther-king-jr-meant-to-new-york/

They carried these inherited behaviors into the caliphate formed by the Islamic State, a place that was supposed to be just and colorblind but instead reveled in violence and was studded with mini neocolonial enclaves, where British Pakistanis lorded over local Syrians, and Saudis lorded over everyone. It would take one or two generations to unlearn these tendencies and deconstruct what had gone so wrong, he said. But he remained loyal to the idea — partly because the alternative he currently lives under is worse. “When the police become the state itself,” he said, “it is truly terrifying.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/opinion/sunday/post-isis-muslim-homeland.html

Just recently Roth joined William Faulkner, Henry James and Jack London as one of very few Americans to be included in the French Pleiades editions (the model for our own Library of America), and the Italian publisher Mondadori is also bringing out his work in its Meridiani series of classic authors. All this late-life eminence — which also includes the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award in 2012 and being named a commander in the Légion d’Honneur of France in 2013 — seems both to gratify and to amuse him. “Just look at this,” he said to me last month, holding up the ornately bound Mondadori volume, as thick as a Bible and comprising titles like “Lamento di Portnoy” and “Zuckerman Scatenato.” “Who reads books like this?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/books/review/philip-roth-interview.html

In this case, it was the way Twitter had enabled Donald Trump to troll the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un about the size of his “Nuclear Button,” causing cortisol levels to spike worldwide. Resistance SF was accusing Dorsey of abetting this kind of behavior by allowing the president an unmediated platform.

The movement for greater faculty diversity can mean that I, a white male in the humanities, am less likely to get a full-time job no matter how well I teach or how much I publish. A colleague suggested I use the idea of “neurodiversity” to qualify as a “diversity hire.” I have several problems with this: First, while I am obsessive about my chosen subject and was probably “on the spectrum” as a child and young adult, I don’t believe this diagnosis fits me. Second, this would be a sort of blackface: I would be claiming to be part of a protected class for my own benefit.

The city balked, and the monument’s designer settled on a family of four in church clothes, with chains lying at the family’s feet.

It showed a furry creature, about the size of a Pomeranian, charging away from the camera and down a driveway. Midway through the video, the animal stops abruptly, turns slightly and stares back — if not directly at the camera, near enough that its retinas catch the light and, for a moment, glow. Then it slouches off, away from the camera and into the darkness. Watching it again, I noticed that the driveway looked oddly familiar — it was my childhood home.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bushnell-trophy-cam.html

2018-01-18,Joel Meyerowitz’s Career Is a Minihistory of Photography,"1. Now wait a second, is this magic? Or has it all been carefully arranged with actors, lighting and special effects? The truth is more surprising: It’s neither. It’s simply a picture snapped by Joel Meyerowitz on a New York City street one day in 1975. No faces are immediately evident, just figures in camel-colored coats turned away from us, a puff of smoke with two people suspended in it. No, four people, if you count those shadows, six if you count the backs on which the shadows fall. In fact there are seven people, if we count the additional shadow in the foreground, the photographer’s — and further figures emerge as the eye adjusts to the deep background. It is a picture that just won’t sit still.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/magazine/joel-meyerowitzs-career-is-minihistory-of-photography.html

2018-01-18,Fear of the Federal Government in the Ranchlands of Oregon,"I took the eastern route from Idaho, on a day of freezing rain, over the Strawberry Mountains, into the broad John Day River Basin, in Oregon. I was used to empty places. Most of my childhood was spent in this region of eastern Oregon, in remote areas of the sagebrush desert or in the volcanic mountains with their jagged peaks and old-growth forests. My family moved away just before I entered high school, and I never returned; I’ve felt in romantic exile ever since. This part of America that had once belonged to my childhood became the spotlight of national news in the winter of 2016, when the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge — an old childhood haunt — became the scene of a cowboy takeover. The takeover began as a protest in the town of Burns after two ranchers were sentenced to prison for arsons on federal land. The ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, caught the attention of the Nevada rancher Ammon Bundy, who thought the punishment unfair. Bundy and a crowd of nearly 300 marchers paraded through Burns, and a splinter group eventually took over the Malheur headquarters. For 41 days, they refused to leave, protesting federal ownership of public lands, which they considered unlawful and abusive. I didn’t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/magazine/fear-of-the-federal-government-in-the-ranchlands-of-oregon.html

The main restaurant is the 110-seat Mezzanine, open only for dinner as of now. Another restaurant, Lobby, with an elegant coffered ceiling, is a more informal, all-day cafe. For drinking, there’s Coffee Bar, done Venetian-style with antique mirrors, which becomes a cocktail bar in the evening; the Giannini Bar, named for Amadeo Giannini, the bank’s founder; the Library, where drinks and light food are served; and a Rooftop Bar, with food, for a pool that opens in the spring. The hotel design is elaborate, by Jacques Garcia, the designer of the NoMad in New York, where Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara also run the restaurant and bars. Mr. Guidara said they did not want the menus to replicate those in New York, so for Los Angeles the food is somewhat lighter — like a blue prawn club sandwich with avocado, and various preparations of broccoli, served with black rice and egg. But the signature chicken for two and the Milk & Honey dessert both made it across the country. The executive chef is Chris Flint, who worked at NoMad and Eleven Madison Park in New York. Mark Welker is the executive pastry chef, and the cocktails are the work of Leo Robitschek, who is also the bar director at NoMad in New York. Both the NoMad hotel and NoMad LA are owned by the Sydell Group: 649 South Olive Street (Seventh Street), Downtown Los Angeles, 213-358-0000, thenomadhotel.com/los-angeles.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/dining/nomad-la-restaurant-news.html

What About the Rest of the Time?,"When the United States government last shut down over a congressional impasse, in 2013, I was 20 days shy of my discharge from the Marine Corps, in Camp Pendleton, Calif. A last-minute bill, signed the day before the rest of the federal government’s appropriations were set to expire, guaranteed that I and the rest of the military would continue to receive our paychecks. It was comforting, I suppose, to know that at least Congress could muster the bipartisan will to accomplish something, but even at the time it struck me as absurd: The same Congress and administration that jumped at the opportunity to demonstrate how much they cared about the troops seemed perfectly comfortable with the status quo of endless war. Missing a paycheck would have been an inconvenience.

Of course I’m surprised, especially when it’s people you know and you’ve worked with, and then this kind of thing comes to light. But on the other hand, the patriarchy has dominated for thousands of years, and people see it as their God-given right. It’s not just sexual harassment or abuse or all the other sexual issues — it’s everything. According to the I.M.F., when women are equally represented in all aspects of economy and business, it can cause national G.D.P.s to rise rapidly. In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise America’s G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points. If people can’t be persuaded to see a woman’s right to control her own body as a moral issue, it’s most definitely an economic one.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/magazine/christiane-amanpour-believes-in-the-power-of-local-news.html

A hot tub bubbled quietly in a corner. The contestants arranged themselves onto a set of bleachers to be appraised by the dashing bachelor, who in this scene was played by the actor Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, best known for his role on the Lifetime television drama “UnREAL.” They were filming the latest season of the reality competition show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” and the day’s challenge was meant to showcase the competitors’ acting abilities. The challenge, called “The Bitchelorette,” was a parody of the farcical dynamics that play out on “The Bachelor” each season.

2018-01-25,Review: Boldly Going Toward Independence in ‘Please Stand By’,"Dakota Fanning is now 23, yet still has the air of a fragile child. And in Ben Lewin’s “Please Stand By,” that sometimes brittle vulnerability serves her well as Wendy, a young woman with autism who dreams of leaving her group home in San Francisco and living with her married sister and baby niece. Yet despite her commitment to the role — and the generally fine supporting performances — this timorous tale sidesteps uncomfortable realities in favor of soothing whimsy and preordained uplift.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/movies/please-stand-by-review-dakota-fanning.html

I should actually say “subjects.” As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski’s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we’ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski’s adult son, Tomasz, will live.
