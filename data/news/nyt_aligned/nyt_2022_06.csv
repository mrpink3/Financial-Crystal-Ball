SaloneSatellite, a launchpad for young talent, which is returning for its 23rd year, has invited more than 600 participants to reflect on design that fosters “autonomy, comfort, movement, usability, interaction and safety for all” in a show called “Designing for Our Future Selves.” Other exhibitions at the fairgrounds in the Milanese suburb of Rho are devoted to offices, kitchens, bathrooms and decorative housewares.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/arts/design/milan-design-week.html

In his short story “In September, the Light Changes” (part of a collection from 2000 of the same name), his protagonist has stayed on Fire Island after Labor Day, at first relishing the emptiness and the palpable absences and then accepting that he has, in some way, been left behind by others (“He had arranged his life, he realized, to be alone, and the world had granted him his arrangement, like a child the rest of the family lets stay in his room at dinner”). Gradually, he becomes intrigued by two men who are staying nearby.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/books/review/andrew-holleran-kingdom-of-sand.html

When trouble arises, Winnie disappears, leaving Ava to deal with the consequences. Seemingly, what you see is what you get — a con artist story, a pop-feminist caper, a fashionable romp. Fun!

A crack addict’s vengeful ex gathered the feces from the dumpsters of East Oakland, Calif., and scattered them in the pool of the Regal-Hi apartment complex, which nobody ever swims in or cleans.

(Moreover, if you have an instinctual grasp of one, the other is often doubly unclear.) Both try to cast a net over the murmurations above us, the sway and flicker of powers larger than ourselves. Both slosh about in the immaterial — futures, desires, loss. Both benefit from a sturdy tether to the practical needs and details of everyday life, but regularly forsake it. Their differences lie in the contexts and communities that hold them close, and, ultimately, in the subtle rift between truth and information.

In general, with challenging patient behavior, I find it best to clearly lay out expectations and the consequences for violating them.

In the United States, until recently, hogs were raised on small farms, fed leftover grain, allowed to run freely in pens and barns and sold at live auctions with competitive bidding. The typical herd ranged in size from the dozens to the low hundreds. During the 1980s, cheap, federally subsidized grain, an absence of antitrust enforcement, the rise of huge meatpacking companies, and new production techniques devised by those companies turned hogs into industrial commodities — and drove 80 to 90 percent of American hog farmers out of the business.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/books/review/wastelands-corban-addison.html

Most of the Time.,"“If only someone would have the courage to be unfashionable,” Barbara Pym, the English novelist whose books form a perfect little canon of the parochial quotidian, complained to her friend Philip Larkin. Pym did. By the time of writing, she had fallen out of step with her times: Several years before, the publisher Jonathan Cape had unceremoniously dropped her, citing declining audiences, in the suddenly swinging ’60s, for her tea-cozy chronicles, busy with spinsters and vicars. Resilience is a Pymian virtue, but it is not exactly rock ’n’ roll. As Paula Byrne points out in her capacious biography, Pym’s annus horribilis was the same 1963 Larkin satirized in his poem “Annus Mirabilis,” as the year sex “began” in the U.K., bookended by “the end of the Chatterley ban” — when the courts ruled Lawrence’s famous novel non-obscene and freely publishable — “And the Beatles’ first LP.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/books/review/paula-byrne-the-adventures-of-miss-barbara-pym.html

2022-06-14,"Chambers, the Evolution of Racines NY, Opens in TriBeCa","Racines NY, a wine bar and restaurant loosely associated with Racines in Paris, opened sporadically during the pandemic, but closed permanently last summer. It severed its ties with the Paris location, began renovations and has reinvented itself as Chambers. David Lillie, an owner of Chambers Street Wines, remains a partner, along with the beverage director, Pascaline Lepeltier, an award-winning French sommelier; the general manager, Jared David, who had that role at Racines NY; and Jonathan Karis, a former chef de cuisine at Gramercy Tavern and the new executive chef. He describes his food as home cooking, though partly boning a chicken and serving it richly marinated and sizzled on a plancha might not be a home cook’s idea of weeknight dinner. Nonetheless, his food is homier than Racines’s. Black bass with braised artichokes and saffron seasoning, grilled sweetbreads with sauerkraut, Little Gem lettuce with a creamy feta dressing and, for dessert, a phyllo mille-feuille with honey-lemon mascarpone are some other dishes he’s planning. Though the restaurant maintains its substantial cellar, the working wine list is brief, rotates seasonally and has an eye on the environment, with an interest in who made the wine and how. Ms. Lepeltier plans to feature hybrid grapes and have wines from Red Hook Winery and others on tap. “I don’t want to serve wines for the 1 percent,” she said. The renovations have resulted in a somewhat more gracious and coherent space framed by curved pale wood panels, brick walls, a long marble bar, a roomier dining counter at the open kitchen and a communal table in front. There are fewer seats, 55 down from 69, reflecting reduced staffing. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

What was really upsetting was that she’d had this problem before — for most of the previous year. When she couldn’t put up with it anymore, she’d gone to her dentist, Dr. Robert Souferian, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who confirmed that her bite had shifted a little. He was reassuring, said that it happened sometimes and offered to file her teeth a little to make the fit better. That worked beautifully — for a few months.

But in the 10th line, the poem deftly switches to the second person: “You know the room/you were born in?

Before white anthropologists recast them as aesthetic treasures and displayed them in museums and private collections, beaded bison-hide sacks were meant for carrying things, and Pueblo pots for storing or cooking food. My own Tlingit ancestors used decorative cedar chests, like one in the permanent collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to store regalia used in religious ceremonies. Luger, who is 43, spent years of his artistic life grappling with the fetishizing of Native objects.

Powell, the Fed chair, said officials were “not trying to induce a recession right now.” Nonetheless, that’s what many fear: If the Fed’s efforts to tame rising prices and tamp down demand go too far, the bank could touch off a serious economic slowdown, forcing businesses to close and sending unemployment numbers back up. And the Fed has shown no signs of changing its path. The increase on Wednesday could be followed by a similarly large one next month.

Though it retains the general contours of its predecessor, it’s more plush and richly upholstered, in deep browns with bright accents. In the evenings, there is live music, including singing from a new balcony stage over the bar, now relocated to a more central position. “It has a combination of luxury elements; it’s built for celebratory moments,” said Jeff Katz, who owns Al Coro with the chef, Melissa Rodriguez.  (She is also the chef and a partner at Mel’s.) Mr. Katz and James Kent, his business partner, recently divided their holdings amicably: Mr. Katz now runs Al Coro and Mel’s, the pizzeria next door, and Mr. Kent is in charge of the Lower Manhattan properties Crown Shy, Saga and Overstory. Mr. Kent said the split made sense from a geographical standpoint. Ms. Rodriguez, who started at Del Posto over 10 years ago and became the executive chef in 2017, described the food as regional Italian. But her tasting dinners ($195 for five courses, $245 for seven), which are detailed by the servers, not printed, involve Italy sporadically. Gremolata and lardo adorn green and white asparagus; frico tops vegetable giardiniera; and a pasta course features culurgiones, a type of dumpling filled with potato, Fontina and mascarpone, with a caviar butter sauce and razor clams. A main course might be a whole roasted sea bass with Marsala and mushrooms, chicken breast done in the style of Peking duck or both on the seven-course menu. Many courses include a collection of savory condiments. The plan is for the menus to be sent to diners the day after their visit, and Ms. Rodriguez plans to change the lineup monthly. There will be a cocktail bar on the spacious lower level. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Ducks are what scientists call precocial birds — capable of feeding, swimming and walking soon after hatching. Still, ducklings are vulnerable, which is why the little puffballs evolved to seek and memorize the image of their mothers. Should a duckling hatch and not see her, it will eagerly imprint on something else, like you.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/magazine/how-to-imprint-ducklings.html

But that hasn’t stopped countless writers from trying, often via fiction — which, like the city, lends itself to wandering. If anything, New York’s scale and complexity — the diversity of neighborhoods and industries and lives that coexist here — are what make it an inexhaustible and consistently compelling setting. There’s also the fact that it’s so closely associated with ambition, which, as any storyteller will confirm, tends to be a useful thing for a protagonist to have. And so, despite myriad differences in aims and style, the New York City novel has become its own literary category, one that T explored for this project, which compiles what we’ve deemed to be the 25 most influential New York novels published between 1921 and 2021.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/t-magazine/new-york-city-novels-books.html

A layered corn cake, shortbread cookies, kouign amann, and mini-loaves of carrot, yuzu and chocolate cake are some other pastries. Hand Hospitality is backing her venture; the name blends her surname with the French word for museum.

The author of this slender volume, a professor of Russian at Williams College, starts a millennium or so ago and goes almost to the present, describing the land, climate and rulers of the sprawling nation that often seems just a loaf away from famine. It has four chapters, no recipes but many literary references. Traditional staple foods, especially fermented, cultured, cured, salted, dried, soured and frozen items, are explained. Soaked oats produced a kind of oat milk “more than a thousand years before it became trendy in Brooklyn,” she writes. Russian salad, Russian table service with sequential courses that supplanted service à la française, and caviar, are of genuine Russian origin; vodka is not, though it was rapidly embraced. Even the Russian restaurateur Andrey Dellos, who briefly opened Brasserie Pushkin and Manon in New York, gets a shout-out.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/dining/a-brief-history-of-russian-food.html

It’s one of three main Pacific salmon varieties, after king (a.k.a. Chinook) and sockeye. These fish are raised in the Finger Lakes region of New York by LocalCoho, in Auburn, N.Y., in an indoor facility established in 2017 using Recirculated Aquaculture Systems technology supported by private funding. The first fish were harvested in 2019 and now, with a $500,000 grant from New York State Development, they’re expanding from limited wholesale availability to retail. The brilliantly bright reddish-pink flesh of the fish, similar to arctic char, has a silky texture and a flavor that’s milder than sockeye or king.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/dining/coho-salmon-new-york.html

2022-06-28,How to Choose a Karaoke Song,"“Don’t sing ‘I Will Always Love You’ if you cannot hit those notes,” says Garvaundo Hamilton, 33, who won the Karaoke World Championships in 2020. Just because you like a song does not mean you should sing it. Many classic songs should probably be avoided unless you’re a trained vocalist with an expansive range — including all of Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Journey and Queen, particularly “Bohemian Rhapsody.” If you want to sound good, he also suggests caution when attempting “rap that’s really too fast for you.” Hamilton, a general manager at a print shop in Seattle, goes out to karaoke nearly every night of the week. He spends at least four hours a day singing to himself in the car, in the shower, at his desk and anywhere else he can. Use a karaoke app on your phone to practice. Hamilton keeps a list of go-to songs on his phone divided into different categories, including up-tempo, ballads and duets. His favorite is Alexandra Burke’s version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.” For karaoke, you don’t need to have all the lyrics memorized, but it helps to have practiced a song until you can sing it confidently. Given the choice, Hamilton avoids private karaoke rooms, opting instead for the bar-style public ones where your audience includes strangers. If you’re shy or planning to sing something new, alcohol can sometimes ease nerves. Don’t overdo it, and choose a room-temperature drink. “Cold beverages aren’t good for your throat,” Hamilton says. You don’t have to be a great vocalist, but your skill level should be a consideration when choosing what to sing. An upbeat party song that prompts a singalong can be a good option for so-so singers who might struggle to carry a song alone.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/magazine/choose-karaoke-song.html
2022-06-28,"Over Decades, Three Friends Learn the Value of Selfishness","In Tomi Obaro’s loving and lively debut novel we meet three women, lifelong friends — “essentially sisters, though Funmi would chafe at the sickly sweetness of such a term.” The dauntless Funmi, diffident Zainab and humble Enitan meet at college in Zaria, Nigeria, in the 1980s, forming (we are boldly told rather than shown) a solid unit, in which Enitan must play second fiddle to the beauties who are her two best friends. Now, 30 years later, their friendship rumpled but still fundamentally intact, the three — all mothers, all in variegatedly troublesome marriages — converge for the wedding of Funmi’s daughter in Lagos. This is the Destiny of the title, an aloof and reluctant bride (“Happiness is for Americans, that’s what Daddy always says”) who lends the plot the modest drama of will-she-or-won’t-she as her big day approaches, all while Funmi steams ahead with ostentatious celebrations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/books/review/dele-weds-destiny-tomi-obaro.html

In their writing and artwork — and also at the glossy tech conferences where they often speak — Bridle holds forth a dark vision of where big tech has actually led us, for all its utopian claims. In their first book, “New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future,” Bridle depicted a world smothering under dark clouds both literal and figurative, a planet whose ecological and structural collapse cannot even be grasped by its people, obscured as it is in a fog of impenetrable complexity. In Bridle’s view, world culture is currently locked in a vicious and deadly cycle, endlessly insisting “on the power of images and computation to rectify a situation that is produced by our unquestioning belief in their authority.” It’s suicide by data, on a global scale.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/books/review/ways-of-being-james-bridle.html

Vowing vengeance, Julia schemes to manipulate the snob into falling in love with her childhood friend Selina Dalton (Freida Pinto), a country naïf whom Julia presents, through bits of trickery, as Malcolm’s dream bride.
