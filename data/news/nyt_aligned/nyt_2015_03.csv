Commenting on the capture of this vessel, the NEW YORK HERALD says: ‘‘Because of the rigidity of French law it was always expected that the seizure would be made by the French navy. It is regarded as fortunate to have a French test case, since there are no issues between France and the United States, while there are issues between Great Britain and the United States. Germany misses an opportunity of twisting the Lion’s tail over this incident.’’ The feeling among the public is that this is the only satisfactory outcome possible of the Dacia case, in view of the extremely friendly feelings which exist between this country and France. On every side I hear admiration expressed of the extreme wisdom shown by the French nation in resisting the temptation to imitate Germany and some of the neutrals in sending propagandists here to meddle in American international affairs, since the public sentiment here is still fighting capably for the Allies. — The New York Herald, European Edition, March 2, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/1915-americans-are-glad-french-not-british-warship-captures-dacia/

Schoolchildren, whose books and satchels were found among debris, were preparing to leave for school when the explosion rocked the apartment building in the Montreal suburb of La Salle at 8:15 a.m. Wind quickly spread the fire from the blast to three adjacent apartment buildings, police said. Two hours later, the fire department declared the fires were under control and the search for victims began. About 100 people were missing, a police official said, as he announced the death toll in the building where the explosion occurred. It housed about 10 families. There were none dead in the adjacent buildings. The middle section of the three-story, U-shaped complex, containing at least 12 apartments was flattened. Two wings of it were heavily damaged by fire from the explosion. Rescue workers — guided by screams and moans — dug into the debris trying to reach an undetermined number who were trapped when the building collapsed with a ‘‘big boom,’’ according to witnesses. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 2, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/1965-montreal-explosion-kills-28/

This November, the “Parks and Recreation” alumnus Nick Offerman will star in the world premiere production of “A Confederacy of Dunces” with the Huntington Theater Company in Boston. The play is being adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher (“Stage Beauty”) from the beloved 1980 novel of the same name by John Kennedy Toole. Alan Friedman called the novel a “masterwork of comedy” in his review for The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Toole was awarded the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for the novel posthumously; he committed suicide in 1969. Many efforts have been made to adapt the novel. John Belushi, Will Ferrell and Jack Black were among those attached to various film projects that never fully developed. Mr. Offerman will be the first lead in the role, and will move from one outlandish egotist (on “Parks”) to another. “I am simply tumescent at the prospect of assaying the beloved character of Ignatius J. Reilly with our team of magnificent and weird artistic champions,” Mr. Offerman said in a statement. “It seems only fitting that I should follow seven seasons of Ron Swanson’s beef with the pudding of Toole’s corpulent fop.” David Esbjornson will direct. Performances are scheduled to run Nov. 11 through Dec. 13.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/theater/nick-offerman-joins-confederacy-of-dunces.html

Tensions were still running high on Sunday, but no further violence was reported. Antifracking protests against the government oil and gas company Sonatrach and its international partners have occurred almost daily for two months, but had been peaceful until now. Clashes broke out when protesters approached Halliburton’s walled compound and burned tires in the roads. The police fired tear gas and detained at least a dozen. About 20 protesters were injured, three of them seriously, according to a local hospital. Algeria, which gets much of its revenue from the export of oil and gas, has been conducting a pilot project to test for shale gas near Ain Salah and announced in December that it was ready to start extracting gas by hydraulic fracturing. Groups that oppose the government have joined the local protesters in Ain Salah to demand a moratorium on fracking, citing environmental concerns.

2015-03-02,What’s On TV Monday,"8 P.M. (El Rey) EL REY NETWORK PRESENTS: THE DIRECTOR’S CHAIR The El Rey network founder Robert Rodriguez interviews Francis Ford Coppola about his inspiration, his reluctance to direct both “The Godfather” (starring Marlon Brando, above) and “The Godfather: Part II,” and his struggles with “Apocalypse Now.” The talk is followed at 9 by “The Conversation” (1974), starring Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who has been hired to eavesdrop on a married woman (Cindy Williams) and her lover (Frederic Forrest) by her husband, known as the Director (Robert Duvall). But three people have died because of Harry’s work, and now he’s worried that two more may soon die. The film received three Oscar nominations but lost for best picture to “The Godfather: Part II.” Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called “The Conversation” haunting and bothersome: “Haunting because its suggestion that technology has gotten out of hand, though not exactly new, is so convincingly and fastidiously detailed. It’s bothersome because Mr. Coppola, the writer as well as the director, has nearly succeeded in making a great film but has, instead, made one that is merely very good.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

For liberals, the decade marked the nation’s greatest transition toward a new era of personal, socioeconomic and political liberation and inclusion, especially for blacks, initiated by the courts, the civil and voting rights acts and the Great Society programs. To most conservatives, the period, with few exceptions, was a terrible turn for the worse. And for African-­American conservatives like ­Jason L. ­Riley and Shelby Steele, beyond the ending of formal discrimination in voting, education and civil rights, the era was for black Americans an unmitigated disaster, the consequences of which persist to this day.

During a hearing at Boston’s federal courthouse, William Fick, a defense lawyer, called the boat a powerful piece of evidence and compared Mr. Tsarnaev’s lying in it to the way a body might lie in a crypt, adding that he did not see why the boat could not be brought to the courthouse. Prosecutors said that the suggestion was impractical, in part because the boat is still covered in blood and broken glass, and that many photographs of it exist. Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. said he may wish to view the boat himself before making a decision. Also Monday, defense lawyers filed their fourth change-of-venue motion with the court.

2015-03-03,What’s on TV Tuesday,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE ARTIST (2011) George Valentin (Jean Dujardin, in an Oscar-winning performance), a silent-screen star, finds his luster fading when he refuses to speak on film with the arrival of sound, while Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), a young extra he helped get a break, becomes the next big thing. Then Peppy insists that Valentin star in her next movie. This film, written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, also won for best director and best picture. “Though its protagonist mourns the arrival of sound, ‘The Artist’ itself is more interested in celebrating the range and power of a medium that can sparkle, swoon and suffer so beautifully that it doesn’t really need to have anything to say,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critics’ pick. And because of the expressiveness and dexterity of Mr. Dujardin and Ms. Bejo — “they dance beautifully and also portray emotion with just the right blend of naturalism and melodramatic exaggeration — ‘The Artist’ is more than a clever pastiche of antique amusements,” he wrote. “It may be something less than a great movie, but it is an irresistible reminder of nearly everything that makes the movies great.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

2015-03-03,The Doom of the American System?,"Vox’s Matt Yglesias has an essay this week making an extended, detailed version of a case that he (and others) have made before: That our era of partisan and ideological polarization is exposing weaknesses inherent in America’s presidential system of government, and that those weaknesses may threaten the stability, if not the survival, of the American constitutional order. It’s an essay that I suspect will be dismissed unread by a number of conservatives as just the latest iteration of the “America the ungovernable”/”the system has failed the president” genre popular among liberal writers in the waning days of struggling Democratic administrations. (Well, Jimmy Carter’s, in particular.) But Yglesias’s argument, to his credit, isn’t a lament for brilliant liberal reforms thwarted by filibustering bad guys and Madisonian mistakes; instead, he argues that President Obama has found ways to govern in the face of gridlock, mostly by the creative/Caesarist application of executive power to domestic policy, and that the next president, Republican or Democratic, will probably find ways to do the same. His point is that governance is increasing happening outside constitutional norms, not that it isn’t happening at all, and that it’s happening that way for reasons that are independent of particular chief executives and whose influence neither political party is likely to soon roll back.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/the-doom-of-the-american-system/

2015-03-04,Seeing Stars at Anthony Vaccarello,"The constellation prize for today’s shows in Paris went to the hairstylist Anthony Turner and the makeup artist Tom Pecheux for the beauties they sent down the runway at Anthony Vaccarello. For Turner, the off-duty look they collaborated on was dictated by casting. “All the girls are beautiful,” he says, “so it wasn’t about creating characters or turning them into something they are not.” For tousled rock-‘n’-roll strands, Turner worked L’Oreal Professional PLI from roots to ends, letting each model’s hair part naturally. Pecheux, for his part, was feeling more Chrissie Hynde and less David Bowie with the tattoo-looking designs he created under one of each of the models’ eyes. Inspired by the clothes, he drew the shape of a star out of the corner of the eye — “but we have seen that before,” he says. So he began erasing the star’s lines until he arrived at a more subtle geometric touch. And despite the heavily-lined eyelids, Pecheux didn’t use a drop of mascara; he didn’t want the models to look “too bourgeoisie.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/anthony-vaccarello-fall-2015-beauty/

2015-03-04,"The 17th Armory Show, New as Ever","What’s that old adage about New York real estate? Location, location, location. So how is it that the Armory Show, which opens its 17th iteration this week, absolutely thrives on Piers 92 and 94 — which sit on the West Side Highway at 55th Street, otherwise known as Manhattan’s Siberia? The secret: its director, Noah Horowitz, who swooped in four years ago to save the fair from what was widely regarded as its hemorrhaging status. At the age of 35, Horowitz, who penned the art-market manual “Art of the Deal” and is a faculty member at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, commands expert status in the ways of the contemporary scene, and has made the fair his own. “Overall, I think the feeling is of renewed strength to the fair. We’ve made a huge emphasis on quality, in the stature of the galleries themselves — and I don’t mean just blue-chip galleries, but also young and mid-career ones, too,” he explains of his strategy. Since finding its foothold in 1999, the Armory Show, which draws its namesake from the Park Avenue Armory and its inspiration from the 1913 exposition accredited with bringing “shock of the new” modernism to America, has always emphasized, well, evolution. “One of the challenges in the market we operate in these days is things have become very flat, and a lot of things start looking the same,” says Horowitz, who stresses his investment in new artists and galleries.

Is it punishment, in the form of economic sanctions, and threats, in the form of imminent military action? And even if negotiations yield an agreement, will a country like Iran, with which the United States has had no formal relations since 1979, abide by an agreement, or will it simply use the accord as a cover for producing a breakout weapon? These are tough questions. And the best answer is up for debate — the kind of complex real-world debate students can participate in, write about and learn from in this lesson.

2015-03-05,Putting a Mattress Through the Rinse Cycle,"For anyone worried about dust mites or bedbugs, or about cleanup after bed-wetting, conventional mattresses have a notable weakness: They’re not washable. That’s one reason Michael Rothbard, the president of Sleep Studio, created Newton Rest, a mattress company that does away with springs and foam. Its mattresses are made with a zip-off casing containing Wovenaire, a spongy, porous block of food-grade polymer developed in Japan. Once unzipped, the casing can be washed, and the Wovenaire can be hosed in the shower. The mattresses are recyclable (the company plans to accept used-mattress returns) and highly breathable. “Air passes easily through it,” Mr. Rothbard said. “Any body heat or perspiration you have during the night dissipates.” A crib mattress ($295) is to be introduced in mid-April; adult mattresses ($1,350 to $2,450), a month later; 212-679-6679, newton.rest or newtonbaby.rest.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/garden/fighting-bed-bugs-and-dust-mites-with-a-washable-mattress.html

Customers are pampered with a degree of customization (sizes, fabrics and a few other features can be selected), but the prices reflect the savings the company makes by dispensing with warehouses and middlemen. Mr. Royer estimated that his sofas cost 30 to 40 percent less than comparable ones sold by conventional retailers. (The Sloan sofa, shown here, starts at $900.) Customers can see the collections in a Chicago showroom, where Interior Define thriftily has its offices, or peruse them online. Not all of the customization options are posted on the website, he said, so be sure to ask.

(Starz Cinema) FAREWELL, MY QUEEN (2012) Sidonie Laborde (Léa Seydoux), the reader to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger) at Versailles, watches as the French monarchy falls in this drama directed by Benoît Jacquot from a novel by Chantal Thomas. Noémie Lvovsky portrays the queen’s lady-in-waiting; Virginie Ledoyen is the woman rumored to be the queen’s lover. “If the rules and the players of this continuing, increasingly dangerous court intrigue remain obscure, it’s because ‘Farewell, My Queen’ is told through Sidonie’s eyes,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Tapping her palace sources, notably an archivist (Michel Robin) and a dressmaker (Anne Benoît), Sidonie learns of news known only to the nobility and their trusted stewards: that the Bastille has been seized.” Mr. Jacquot, she added, “has always been a sensitive director of actresses, his sympathies evident in his caressing, sometimes ogling camerawork and the time and space he gives women and their stories. That sympathy is evident here too, though crucially, while he doesn’t demonize Marie Antoinette, he doesn’t turn her into a spurious feminist martyr.” In French, with English subtitles.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Lusitania as sport divers returned triumphantly to the surface. When they came aboard, the gleeful explorers, part of a marine archaeology expedition sanctioned by the Irish government, produced a piece of history — a plastic container holding a handful of .303 rounds they’d found inside the plankton-­hazed ruins, rounds that had been manufactured in America and bought by the British to kill Germans during World War I. One of the divers peeled back the lid, and the corroded ammunition greeted fresh air for the first time in 93 years. “There’s thousands of cases of ammo down in that hole!” one of the Irish ­divers cried out. “You could just scoop the stuff up!” But then he turned somber. Even though he had dived the great wreck dozens of times before, the expression on his face was that of a spooked man. “It will always be a scary place, a daunting place,” he told me. “There’s a lot of lost souls down there.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/books/review/erik-larsons-dead-wake-about-the-lusitania.html

2015-03-06,Review: ‘The Art Show’ at the Park Avenue Armory Covers the Creative Map,"What you see on entering “The Art Show,” the annual fair of the Art Dealers Association of America, is yourself and other visitors reflected in a giant mirror. Displayed in Luhring Augustine’s booth, “Cords,” by the veteran Italian conceptualist Michelangelo Pistoletto, consists of four mirrored panels with a cutout, photographic rendering of stanchions connected by fat ropes. The ropes evoke the atmosphere of exclusivity fostered by high-end galleries like the 72 convened here. On the other hand, the mirror inclusively reflects viewers themselves and, by extension, the broader public they belong to. In art, the public might find reflections of itself and its own, ever-evolving cultural identity.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/design/review-the-art-show-at-the-park-avenue-armory-covers-the-creative-map.html

The yellow eyes glow, their intensity magnified by concentric ringlike markings that spread outward, like a feathery vortex. The plumage is regal — thick drapery, in a gray and brown pattern, falling in soft folds. The owl exudes the heavy solemnity of one of Velázquez’s popes or Holbein’s portrait of Thomas More.

2015-03-06,Mexico: Gunmen Kill a Navy Officer," A navy officer put in charge of Mexico’s second-largest port in an effort to wrest control of it from a drug gang was shot and killed in what the authorities said Thursday was a robbery attempt. The officer, Rear Adm. José Luis Corro Chávez, was shot Wednesday after he refused to leave his vehicle when gunmen demanded it outside his house in the port city of Lázaro Cárdenas, in Michoacán State. Two suspects have been arrested. Admiral Corro had served at the port since November 2013, when the navy began trying to root out the Knights Templar gang, which had been smuggling iron ore to China and extorting mining interests in the area. The authorities said the shooting was not related to organized crime, but it came nearly a week after the arrest of the former top leader of the Knights Templar, Servando Gómez.

2015-03-06,Senate Will Postpone Debate on Iran," Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will postpone consideration of a bill giving Congress the authority to review any deal President Obama reaches with Iran on its nuclear program, bowing to opposition from Democrats who charged that he was rushing the measure. Mr. McConnell, who this week set the stage for a procedural vote on the legislation on Tuesday, decided on Thursday that he would wait to bring up the bipartisan measure. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said that would give Democrats time to “decide whether or not they believe they and Congress as a whole should be able to review and vote on any deal the president cuts with the leaders of Iran.” The decision merely delays what promises to be an intense debate in Congress over whether Mr. Obama should be able to seal a deal with Iran aimed at blocking it from acquiring nuclear weapons and under what terms. A growing bipartisan coalition of lawmakers believes Congress must have a say over any such accord, and they are moving to lay out tough requirements for Mr. Obama that could shape any deal.

2015-03-06,What’s on TV Friday,"8 P.M. (Starz) MALEFICENT (2014) In this live-action back story to the 1959 Disney animated musical “Sleeping Beauty,” a happy young fairy (in a role shared by Isobelle Molloy and Ella Purnell) living in the moors becomes friends — and then something a bit more, involving a kiss — with a human farmhand (played by Michael Higgins and Jackson Bews). But eventually the boy grows into a man (Sharlto Copley) and helps wage war against the mossy wonderland of the fairy (now Angelina Jolie), whose wings are literally clipped. Now in an eternally foul mood, she retreats into a dark place, where years later she plots against his child, Aurora (Elle Fanning), who is destined to fall into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spindle. Ms. Jolie “makes a fabulous monster” as “she breezes through the movie, part superstar, part superfreak,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Consciously or not, coherently or not, ‘Maleficent’ tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us. And while that may sound drippy, it’s exactly the kind of hokey that, movie by movie, may finally make a real difference.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

The creative and image director of Christian Dior Makeup carefully complemented each look with a single shade of eye shadow (deep green, navy, aubergine or brick), which he applied wet, to intensify the pigment, over the socket and up to the orbital bone. The unifying application on each face: four to five coats of mascara and heavy black kohl liner. “We wanted graphic makeup with a little twist,” Philips says. It is indeed a dark departure from the thin adhesive strips of pastel eyeliner he created for the house’s spring 2015 runway.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/makeup-christian-dior-paris-fashion-week-fall-2015/

Indeed, for the contemporary Chinese artist Zhang Huan, whose restaging of Handel’s 18th-century operatic version of the myth opens for its first U.S. run this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the constant of any opera “is found in the attention it pays to the human desire.” Speaking via an interpreter from his Shanghai studio a few days before the curtain was set to raise, Zhang freely admitted that he initially lacked interest in opera as an art form. Known for large-scale bronze statues of disembodied Buddhas and performance pieces entailing body suits made of raw meat, Zhang’s appointment to direct Handel’s opera in 2009, for the Brussels-based opera house La Monnaie, raised the eyes of both opera and art-world aficionados. “I had hoped people not only saw an opera, but also performance art,” Zhang says. “‘Semele,'” he quickly adds, “was my very first opera, and it will be my very last.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/zhang-huang-semele-bam/

2015-03-09,Inside T’s Spring Men’s Style Issue,"T’s latest issue examines the many conflicting ideas at play in men’s fashion and style today. No one embraced those contradictions more than our cover subject, the legendary Jean-Michel Basquiat: We peek inside his closely guarded notebooks and shine a light on the painter as you’ve never seen him before. Shayne Oliver, the Hood by Air designer who likely would have rolled in Basquiat’s circle had he been born 20 years earlier, shares with us the many diverse influences behind his gender-fluid street wear. In an essay focusing on clothes like Oliver’s, Jon Caramanica traces how rap icons such as Raekwon and Kanye West have influenced not only street fashion, but the runway as well. We’ve also dressed some of France’s most talented men in some of the season’s best clothes — proving that some things, like brooding-French-artist chic, never lose their appeal. Elsewhere, Andrew O’Hagan combs through the male overgrooming epidemic, looking for chaos amid the order; Jody Rosen travels to Ordos, China, one of the world’s most famous ghost towns that wants to be so much more; the artist Pablo Bronstein takes us inside his home in Deal, England, where antique glamour and campy kitsch live in curious harmony; and Marilyn Manson and John Waters test out an urban scooter and one-legged pants, with predictably weird results.

2015-03-09,What’s on TV Saturday,"9 P.M. (Showtime) INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013) Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn, an aspiring folk singer mourning the death of his musical partner (the voice of Marcus Mumford) and leaving mayhem — a crying hostess, a pregnant woman, an escaped cat — in his wake as he bounces from couch to couch in Greenwich Village during a single week in 1961. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Stark Sands and Adam Driver round out the cast as Llewyn’s fellow folk singers; John Goodman is a drug-addicted jazzman; and Garrett Hedlund is a Beat poet. And while Llewyn’s background and antics were inspired by the life of Dave Van Ronk, “this is not a biopic, it’s a Coen brothers movie, which is to say a brilliant magpie’s nest of surrealism, period detail and pop-culture scholarship,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Isaac, a versatile character actor here ascending to the highest levels of his craft, refuses the easy road of charm.” One of the film’s lessons, as Mr. Scott sees it, is: “We are, as a species, ridiculous: vain, ugly, selfish and self-deluding. But somehow, some of our attempts to take stock of this condition — our songs and stories and moving pictures, old and new — manage to be beautiful, even sublime.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

The hairstylist Anthony Turner interpreted this as “almost Amazonian,” he said backstage, by giving the models deep side parts lined up with the outer edge of the brow and slicking hair into long, thick, low ponytails with a blunt edge. By contrast, the makeup artist Aaron de May brought the free-spirited warrior women to life with dewy, pearlescent complexions, glassy lips and a thick swath of opaque white shadow applied with a chopped-up paintbrush to create an erratic edge. “The makeup feels like they took something from nature and put it on with their fingers,” Leon says. “It looks like the girls did it themselves,” de May adds.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/kenzos-battle-ready-white-shadow/

Viet Cong guerrillas fired at the U.S. transport planes carrying many of the troops, but apparently the only result was a bullet hole in the wing of a C130 aircraft. No Marines were hurt. South Vietnamese government troops had spent the weekend flushing out Viet Cong guerrillas in the area to make the region around Da Nang as safe as possible for the 3,500-man Marine force to land. But the Marine deployment around the air base could soon lead to the first ground fighting between U.S. combat units and Communist guerrillas in Vietnam. U.S military men have been serving as advisers to South Vietnamese Army and Marine outfits in the field. But until now, there have been no American ground combat formations in South Vietnam. Spokesmen for the U.S military mission in Saigon said the Marines would remain under U.S. control, but their duties would be assigned after consultation with South Vietnamese military officers. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 9, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/1965-marines-land-in-vietnam-by-sea-air/

His voice is a richly melancholy moan, with echoes of Van Morrison and Jeff Buckley; his music is grounded in blues, soul and Celtic ballads, and it’s full of minor chords, starkly syncopated guitar picking, blunt tom-tom beats and moody drama. Yet Hozier, whose debut album was released last fall, is also a hitmaker who was greeted, between his doleful songs, with the squeals and whistles of pop adoration and female voices calling out, “I love you!”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/arts/music/review-hozier-at-beacon-theater-with-somber-songs-of-love-and-other-futilities.html

Sherman arrived in Boston for the 1890 national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, he was already sick of hearing “Marching Through Georgia,” a song commemorating his historic 1864 campaign from Atlanta to the Atlantic coast. The opera singer Clara Louise Kellogg, a friend of his, later asserted that Sherman had always hated it “above all songs,” but something snapped in the old general’s mind that day in Boston. We can only imagine his growing discomfort as he stood on the grandstand and heard no less than 250 different bands parade by playing the tune. Although Sherman kept his composure at the time, rumors quickly spread that he vowed then and there to never attend another reunion without a guarantee that no one would play it.

2015-03-09,What’s On TV Monday,"9:10 A.M. (HBO Signature) ATONEMENT (2007) Saoirse Ronan (above with James McAvoy) received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Briony, a 13-year-old aspiring playwright who accuses the son (Mr. McAvoy) of a family servant — and the lover of her older sister (Keira Knightley) — of a crime in this drama directed by Joe Wright and based on the Ian McEwan novel. Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony at different times in her life. “The main casualty of the film’s long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme — and also the ingenious formal gimmick — that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “As the title suggests, ‘Atonement’ is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.” The film received six more Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, and won for Dario Marianelli’s score, featuring the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and a clacking typewriter.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-03-09,"Brooklyn Style, Transported to the Suburbs of Connecticut","Brooklyn might be the cradle of the maker movement, with its deep appreciation for all that’s handcrafted and artisan-made, but predictably that cultural aesthetic has increasingly found a home in the borough’s surrounding suburbs. Case in point: Gather, a recently opened fashion and home décor shop tucked away in the front-porch-loving town of Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Co-owned by Rebecca Karson, a former prop stylist who grew up in Brooklyn Heights, the 80-square-foot space is tiny (even by New Yorkers’ standards) and filled with a well-edited selection of small batch goods, including porcelain clay pottery hand-carved by the artist Elizabeth Benotti; Jess Brown’s rag dolls, which are filled with sustainable corn fiber and dyed using Persian black tea; slim, delicate gold jewelry sculpted by Rebecca Peacock (who works out of her farmhouse studio in the Catskill Mountains); and delicate clothing from Nuthatch, which hails from Maine and employs local mills. In other words, it’s a mix you can imagine browsing, matcha tea in hand, at the Brooklyn fleas. Still, Karson didn’t set out to curate her shop that way. She simply scouts for pieces that catch her eye. “I’ve always gravitated towards things that are handmade or vintage,” she explains. “They tell a more interesting story.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/gather-store-connecticut/

2015-03-09,The Most Memorable Costumes of ‘Mad Men’ Get the Museum Treatment,"As compelling as the storylines and characters on “Mad Men” — which airs the second half of its final season beginning April 5 on AMC — are the show’s meticulously researched 1960s-era costumes. (In many instances, the outfits — Ginsberg’s stained shirt, Megan’s “Zou Bisou Bisou” dress — almost feel like characters themselves.) Now, a new exhibition opening March 14 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, “Matthew Weiner’s Mad Men,” brings the show’s wardrobe, and the rest of its creative process, to life. More than 25 of the ensembles developed by the show’s costume designer, Janie Bryant, will appear alongside props, advertisements and other ephemera from the show’s production department, giving fans the chance to see such garments as Joan’s blood-stained dress from the lawn-mower episode and Sally’s first minidress up close. Bryant worked closely with the museum’s curators to assemble the collection, even going so far as to track down clothing that had since disappeared into Hollywood costume houses. “To see a costume in full action on screen and then see it standing still,” she says, “is a whole different kind of visual experience.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/the-most-memorable-costumes-of-mad-men-get-the-museum-treatment/

2015-03-09,Rubio-Lee: Promise and Problems,"Last week, Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee released the outline of a comprehensive tax reform, which adds changes to corporate and investment taxes to their earlier proposal for a more pro-family revision of the individual code. The plan earned generally favorable comments from Yuval Levin, Ramesh Ponnuru and James Pethokoukis, all writers associated with the tendency we’re calling reform conservatism, but the addition of tax cuts on the business side drew praise from a wider range of conservative and libertarian policy writers and economists as well. The reformist interest in reorienting Republican tax policy toward middle-class families has created tensions with the party’s supply-side wing, but because it reforms the corporate/business code the Rubio-Lee plan clearly has the potential to be a politically-unifying vision, marrying pro-family and pro-growth policy while putting the era of “9-9-9″ and Fair Tax-style unicorns in the rearview mirror.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/rubio-lee-promise-and-problems/

Agent," The United States announced Monday that it had increased to $5 million its reward for information that could lead to the safe return of Robert A. Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007. The move comes as the Obama administration appears to be closing in on an agreement with Iran under which Tehran would accept limits on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. The fate of Americans who have been detained by Iran — or in Mr. Levinson’s case who have disappeared there — is not formally part of the talks. Monday was the eighth anniversary of Mr. Levinson’s disappearance, which occurred during a visit he made to Kish Island, Iran. His family received photographs and a video in late 2010 and early 2011.

2015-03-10,"A Spare, Minimalist R&B Video Influenced by Marina Abramovic","It’s been two and a half years since the debut single “Till We Ghosts” introduced the world to the crooning, beat-heavy brand of indie rock proffered by the Belgian-born, Cape Town-raised, London-based musician Yannick Ilunga, who records as Petite Noir. Since then, he’s collaborated with Mos Def, signed with the U.K. label Domino, opened for Solange and been featured on her “Saint Heron” compilation album. But Ilunga would tell you his most notable achievement to date is coining the term “Noirwave,” a new, ideologically influenced artistic genre that identifies as African first, and everything else second. “The term ‘African music’ is so overused,” Ilunga says, “to the point that when some people say it, it just sounds cheesy. Noirwave was always meant to include clothing, art, photography, music obviously — all types of things. It’s taking the Africa that we know, turning it upside down and bringing people a new black. Solange is super Noirwave. So is Beyoncé. Noirwave is pop culture — it’s coming, but right now it’s just boiling.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/petite-noir-music-video-the-fall/

And for the truly elite, spa retreats — fitness-oriented getaways that strip both calories and stressors from one’s system, jamming in meditative hikes and vegan, gluten-free everything in their place — are the ultimate spring break destination. One of the most expensive such programs is the Ranch at Live Oak in Malibu, where the likes of Bobbi Brown, Kate Spade and, just last month, Mandy Moore and Minka Kelly escape to detox, reset and rejuvenate. Now, though, the Ranch’s culinary secrets are available to the masses in their first, self-titled cookbook.

2015-03-11,What’s On TV Wednesday,"10 P.M. (BBC America) BROADCHURCH After learning that her husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), murdered Danny Latimer, Detective Sgt. Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, above) returns to Broadchurch to hear what she assumes will be his guilty plea. But then he declares his innocence, forcing a courtroom battle that will re-examine the case. Detective Alec Hardy (David Tennant), meanwhile, finds himself embroiled in an unsolved murder and disappearance from his past. “Season 2 is, from the start, an entirely messier, more contingent affair, enjoyable in a different and, to me, more appealing way,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Having Joe plead not guilty enables Chris Chibnall, the show’s creator and writer, “to keep all the central characters of Season 1 around without the usual implausibility of plunging the town into a new mystery. It’s also a device to get Ms. Colman’s Ellie Miller back into the center of the story” — where she once again steals the show. “She’s a wonderful comic actress, and now even more than before Mr. Tennant is her straight man — Miller has had it, and Hardy has to absorb all of her (amusing) petulance and disgust.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

The Post noted that Adelson had given $5 million to the G.O.P.’s Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, which had spent $35,000 in a failed effort to defeat Ashford in his 2014 race against Representative Lee Terry.

But if the book is disarmingly heartfelt, it is also undeniably strange. It is set in a mysterious “great green room” where, page by page, the light grows more weirdly crepuscular. The room’s curious props include a comb, a brush and a bowl full of mush. Its most memorable line, “Goodnight nobody,” could have been written by Samuel Beckett. It is a brilliant children’s book, but its brilliance lies in its dreamlike oddity. Like a good witch, Brown weaves a kindly spell, and children succumb.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/emily-jenkinss-a-fine-dessert-and-more.html

What should you do when you see what may be your last chance — a potentially dangerous one — to defy your cancer and live the way you want? In these books the characters take that risk. Yet somehow they’re entirely different stories, “The Honest Truth” an adventure yarn about a boy and his dog, “Wish Girl” a quietly poetic story about psychological truths.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/the-honest-truth-and-wish-girl.html

2015-03-12,Anti-Abortion Provision May Stop Human Trafficking Bill in Senate,"A bipartisan Senate bill that would increase penalties for perpetrators and support for victims of human trafficking met potentially fatal resistance Wednesday over an anti-abortion provision. Senate Democrats blocked consideration of the legislation many had supported as recently as Monday, accusing Republicans of sneaking in language that would ban money from a victims’ fund from being used for abortions. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said his party would not allow it to move forward with that provision. Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who introduced the bill, said Democrats had rejected his suggestion to introduce an amendment stripping out the language. He said the Senate would vote Thursday to end debate on the bill, but it seemed unlikely that he would have the 60 votes needed to overcome Democratic opposition.

2015-03-12,Cuba: Leader of Dissident Group Retains Her Post After Challenge," Cuba’s most high-profile opposition group, the Ladies in White, voted Wednesday to keep their leader, Berta Soler, in a referendum prompted by complaints that she was autocratic and should resign. The challenge to Ms. Soler’s leadership exposed divisions within the group as it grapples with the changing relationship between Cuba and the United States and the group’s shifting status among Cuba’s increasingly diverse opposition groups. Ms. Soler said by telephone that she had won 180 of a total of 201 votes cast. Sixteen members of the group voted against her, and the remaining ballots were blank or annulled, she said. More than 30 members did not vote. Several members called for Ms. Soler’s resignation after a video emerged in which some in the group surrounded a member, Alejandrina García de la Riva, in December, waving their fists and chanting, “Down traitor.” The Ladies in White was formed in 2003 to protest the imprisonment of 75 dissidents. Most of the dissidents have since been released, but the group continues to march weekly to demand democratic reform and freedom of speech.

A third, the teenager Tony Gutiérrez (Johnny Ortiz), is placed is juvenile detention, while the fourth, Hector Tontz (Richard Cabral), is told that he will be extradited to Mexico. “This series is at heart a murder mystery — someone has been killed, and the show withholds who did it,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times about this limited series, created by John Ridley, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “12 Years a Slave.” “But solving the crime isn’t the point.” What matters “is not just what is said but also the prickly sting of what is left unstated,” she added. “Miscommunication, misunderstandings and, on occasion, a stab of ice-cold reality are all part of the bereavement and also the investigation. ‘American Crime’ is a depressing story told so skillfully that it’s almost impossible not to be happy to see it unfold.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Based in Portland (Maine, as opposed to the West Coast bastion of progressive proclivities), Braunig creates portraits that have frequently been described as a merging of Op Art and Surrealism. She terms her approach “superficial realism,” as the undulating, trippy forms she commits to canvas are faithful interpretations of still lives she stages herself.

Many include some big names in the campus world — but for a lot of reasons, many don’t.

2015-03-13,Mario Vargas Llosa’s ‘Discreet Hero’,"When I think of the writers I adored in my 20s, during the 1970s and ’80s, it almost makes me think that winning the Nobel Prize in Literature must not be so hard, because nearly every one of them has won it: García Márquez, Bellow, Morrison, Coetzee, Naipaul, Grass and, in 2010, the youngest and only surviving member of the Latin American “boom,” Mario Vargas Llosa. I mention this not to pitch myself as a reliable Nobel handicapper but to point out the futility of ascribing any politically correct left-wing bias to the Swedish Academy, since at least three of those favorites — Bellow, Naipaul and Vargas Llosa — are about as politically correct as Margaret Thatcher. All three have been identified with the cultural and political right, none more so than Vargas Llosa, who ran seriously for the presidency of Peru and who to this day is probably, partly through the opinion columns he publishes in Spain’s El País, the Spanish language’s most prominent conservative intellectual.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/mario-vargas-llosas-discreet-hero.html
2015-03-13,"‘The Illuminations,’ by Andrew O’Hagan","The literature of war is by its very nature political. If a writer’s sentences are ­personal — what else, really, can they be? — and a writer has trained his lens on a bloody battleground, in reading him we will come to know where he stands, where his passions lie. When it comes to fiction, this passion can often result in ­rhetoric-spouting characters whose sole purpose is to service the author’s ideas. But in “The Illuminations,” the Scottish novelist and critic Andrew O’Hagan has created a story that is both a howl against the war in Afghanistan and the societies that have blindly abetted it, and a multilayered, deeply felt tale of family, loss, memory, art, loyalty, secrecy and forgiveness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/the-illuminations-by-andrew-ohagan.html

The most interesting facet of Reif Lar­sen’s 600-plus-page novel, “I Am Radar,” is that it reads like something far more compact than its bulk might suggest. There are maps, diagrams and pictures (e.g., an elephant plummeting from a bridge, a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge) that remind one of the ­visual arrangements in W. G. Sebald’s novels. Then there is a deeply patterned narrative that darts easily from small-bore domestic dramas to sweeping historical catastrophes with just the right fillip of silliness and levity to keep the whole text eminently ­approachable.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/reif-larsens-i-am-radar.html
2015-03-13,Inside the List,"The Insider: Joseph Kanon’s seventh historical thriller, “Leaving Berlin,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 11. Kanon first cracked the list with his debut novel, “Los Alamos,” in 1997 — but he was already well known in the book business before then, having spent some 30 years as an editor and publishing executive, including a stint as president of Dutton. During that long first act, Kanon worked with fiction writers including Muriel Spark, Louis Auchincloss, Frank Conroy and Jayne Anne Phillips. But he never dreamed of writing a novel himself, he told an Australian newspaper in 2009. “I didn’t have manuscripts secretly in the bottom drawer,” he said. “Honestly, I didn’t. I was happy in publishing. I was in the service of other people’s books. The last thing you want is to be in competition with your writers.” That all changed after Kanon left the industry in the mid-1990s, when he vacationed in New Mexico and was struck by the idea for a crime novel set during the Manhattan Project. “I never told anyone I was doing it,” he said. “I didn’t even tell my wife. I didn’t know if I could do it. What could be more embarrassing than a publisher who couldn’t write?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2015-03-13,Mary Helen Specht’s ‘Migratory Animals’,"Tales of naïve Americans abroad may have defined our national fiction around the turn of the last century, but the literature of the early 21st abounds with an entirely more sophisticated sort of traveler, perfectly exemplified by Flannery, the hard-as-nails heroine of Mary Helen Specht’s delightfully ambitious first novel, “Migratory Animals.” A far cry from Henry James’s Isabel Archer, Flannery — like many of her generation and station — is “on the lam” from both her middle-class, middlebrow roots and the lifestyle-driven superficiality carefully honed by her onetime college friends. She has settled in Nigeria less because her work as a climate-change scientist has repercussions for local farmers and more because it’s a few continents away from her sister, Molly, “an emotional tar pit” for whom Flannery served as a surrogate mother during the years when the girls’ actual mother was slowly, grotesquely deteriorating from Huntington’s disease.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/mary-helen-spechts-migratory-animals.html

One side of this rare coin shows ­military-style daggers flanking a felt pileus cap, a symbol of freedom from slavery, and the abbreviation EID MAR. On the other side, remarkably, Brutus had his own portrait stamped. Before this, Caesar was the only Roman who had dared put himself on a coin, for to do so was to assume the stature of a monarch — or a god.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/the-death-of-caesar-by-barry-strauss.html

In this deeply satisfying historical novel, he recreates the voice of Lucy Ann Lobdell, a real mid-19th-­century New York woman who abandoned her young daughter and set out — dressed and passing as a man — to find the independence (and money) denied her as a woman. After many years of wandering as Joseph Lobdell, she married another woman and eventually found herself locked away as a lunatic.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/books/review/the-rebellion-of-miss-lucy-ann-lobdell-by-william-klaber.html

The talks were abruptly scheduled at the invitation of the Cubans. The United States will be represented by Roberta S. Jacobson, Washington’s top diplomat for the Americas. Ms. Jacobson will travel to Havana on Sunday, and a senior official at the State Department said she would probably stay until midweek. No announcements were expected, but the sides planned to discuss issues holding up plans to reopen embassies before a regional summit meeting in April. Cuba wants to be removed from the State Department’s list of nations that sponsor international terrorism and seeks access to banking for its diplomatic posts in the United States. American officials are pushing for an increase in the number of staff members at the planned American Embassy in Havana and unrestricted travel for diplomats on the island. The two sides held talks in Havana in January and in Washington last month, reporting progress but no breakthroughs.

2015-03-16,What’s on TV Sunday,"10 P.M. (E!) THE ROYALS Elizabeth Hurley and Vincent Regan portray the foul-mouthed Queen Helena and bewildered King Simon, the rulers of a decadent if fictional British dynasty in this nighttime soap, the network’s first scripted series. Leading their unruly brood is Prince Liam (William Moseley, above center, with Ms. Hurley and Mr. Regan), the heir apparent after his older brother dies, who angers his mother by sleeping with the daughter (Merritt Patterson) of the queen’s head of security. Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park), meanwhile, likes to drink, take drugs, seduce servants and bodyguards, and party in Paris nightclubs without any underwear. “The Royals” “should be a hoot, but it actually gets old, and dull, very quickly,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “It turns out that campy faux queens and princes can’t keep up with the real-life Elizabeth II and her progeny — or with reality show royals.” The Season 10 opener of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” — in which Kim and her husband, Kanye West, have sex in a bathroom, and family members act as if nothing were going on with Bruce Jenner, despite his ponytail and changing face — leads in at 9. Of the two series, “the Kardashians are better at keeping up appearances,” Ms. Stanley added. “The monarchy has survived in Britain for so many centuries partly because it protects its mystique and doesn’t bend to reality. The Kardashians have held onto their perch on cable television for 10 seasons for much the same reason.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

2015-03-16,What’s On TV Monday,"11:20 P.M. (Starz) THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (2014) Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, above) pines for information about his deceased parents and agonizes over his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) while attending to his responsibilities as Spider-Man in this sequel directed by Marc Webb. An Oscorp employee turned electrified, unhinged villain (Jamie Foxx) has a debilitating effect on New York City. Peter’s friend, the Oscorp heir Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), desperately seeks to cure the illness he inherited from his recently deceased father, with ghoulish consequences. The film “balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “There are moments — as when the image freezes on the tucked, airborne Spider-Man, ready to spring into action like an Olympian — in which the movie taps into the giddy freedom and near-unboundedness that the character’s physical transformation has brought him.”  Hints of future villains should please fans. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-03-17,"Left and Right, Family and Economics","My Sunday column weighed in on the latest (and presently very intra-Timesian) version of the neverending “does culture or economics explain family breakdown?” debate. Responding, in part, to the critics of my colleague David Brooks’s earlier column on morals and the social fabric, I made the case that there just hasn’t been the kind of significant increase in privation (or the kind of cuts to welfare programs; quite the reverse) that some writers on the left invoke as an explanation for why today’s poor and working class Americans are so much less likely than in prior eras to have children within wedlock and stay married when they do. Instead, notwithstanding all the burdens they bear and challenges they face, downscale Americans have somewhat more income and a much stronger safety net than their grandparents and great-grandparents did. So as much as economic burdens clearly play a role in family instability, and would be plausible explanations for the existence of a persistent rich-poor family-structure gap, they seem like weaker explanations for why out-of-wedlock birth rates have gone up so rapidly over the last half-century, not only among the underclass but increasingly in Middle America as well.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/left-and-right-family-and-economics/

Enclosed in a slender rose gold case, the luminescent dial of the watch shown here features numerals custom-created by Philippe Apeloig, a well-regarded French graphic designer. (Apeloig is also behind the signage for Jean Nouvel’s upcoming Louvre Abu Dhabi.) A sapphire crystal case back reveals the ultrathin automatic movement, manufactured at the prestigious Swiss watchmaker Vaucher, now owned in part by Hermès. As befits a company that started out making leather harnesses for European noblemen in 1837, the hand-stitched Havana alligator strap receives the same attention to detail as does a Kelly bag. Valuing creativity and craftsmanship above all, Hermès shows how perfect simple can be. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/hermes-slim-watch/

2015-03-19,The Brooklyn-Born-Raised-and-Based Artist Who Dripped Her Way to Chanel Sneakers and Car Service,"The biggest change in Joyce Pensato’s life since her recent ascent to painterly panacea? “Oh, I only take car services now,” she giddily boasts. That’s also discounting the Chanel high-tops she splurged for recently at Barneys, but hey, she only bought them because they were comfortable. “Well, I got two pairs,” she confesses. In fact, that Uber is Pensato’s greatest quotidian extravagance at the age of 70 — or somewhere in that ballpark, a lady never tells — is revealing of a painter who not only remained in the New York art scene’s periphery until recently, but, like many women, took years to find the confidence to really be herself. “I was really isolated, I wasn’t connected to any scene, I felt so alone,” she says. It could be easy to lump Pensato into the art world’s growing trend of “discovering” artists in their golden years. But her big, brash, bold canvases of Batman, Bart Simpson and other pop-cultural totems, which have become instantly recognizable, actually are not simply the byproduct of some advanced-style fad. In fact, her current and fourth solo at New York’s Petzel Gallery, open until March 28, features the caricature motifs she’s been working in since as long as she can remember (as well a surrealist Pop-culture series of photographs she’s just beginning to explore). Though Pensato has been drawing her whole lifetime, her tale is one of a personal journey of self-expression and finding her own unbeaten path — even if “I never got off the L train,” she jokes.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/joyce-pensato-castaway-petzel-gallery/

Festivals tend to evolve into these huge, multi-faceted events that get inundated with people and morph into something totally different from what they started as.

Now in her early 70s, Ms. Frecon has for over three decades been homing in on one or two simple shapes seen against one color. Her newest paintings have two panels whose division forms a kind of horizon line, while the shapes themselves imply curved hillocks, small mountains, crystalline ponds, low-hanging clouds and rising or setting suns. Despite the use of ‘Sun” in this show’s title, her colors, which she grinds and mixes herself, tend toward dark. Rust, blues and greens prevail here with results that seem like nocturnes. They combine Rothko’s color at its most winey and most somber with the carefully modulated geometries of Ellsworth Kelly, but are always clearly handmade, painted with a meditative quality that evokes Morandi.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/arts/design/suzan-frecon-oil-paintings-and-sun.html

Too many movies hurtle forward on fast editing and breathless plotting, and too much of life goes by in a blur. The characters in four of Mr. Alonso’s features — “La Libertad,” “Los Muertos,” “Liverpool” and now “Jauja” — undertake difficult journeys, at least partly on foot, across hostile terrain. Following them through long takes and static shots accompanied by abundant silence and sparse dialogue and music, the viewer feels the weight of time.

Ms. Essbaum has named her married, dissatisfied heroine Anna, as in Karenina. So the train reference qualifies as an earnest literary allusion. And like all the rib-elbowing indications that this Anna has destructive traits, from promiscuity to pyromania, it qualifies as one of this graceless book’s ideas of foreshadowing.

In between, bodies run, leap and fall amid nuzzling lips, blasting bullets and periodic story turns that make the movie a modest cultural artifact if one largely devoid of aesthetic interest. At this point, the heroine, Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley), can easily lock and load, having been trained by a thuggishly stylish faction, Dauntless, whose members wear the usual blah-blah black, tats and piercings and guard this dystopian world. “They’re our protectors, our soldiers, our police,” Tris says of them in the first movie, if also “crazy.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/movies/review-insurgent-brandishes-a-tougher-shailene-woodley.html

The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-sponsored research group, said that in late February ice cover in the Arctic Ocean reached its maximum extent, 5.61 million square miles, which is about 7 percent less than the average from 1981 to 2010 and about 1 percent less than the previous lowest year, 2011. The center said that changes in the jet stream created warmer than normal conditions on the Pacific side of the Arctic. While the extent of Arctic sea ice is naturally variable, it has been generally declining over the past several decades as the region warms more quickly than other parts of the planet.

Bedwell, the founder of the vintage accessories brand Foundwell, pulled together a range of vintage and antique items — equally practical and whimsical — to outfit the proper bar, desk and dressing room. For drinks, there’s an opulent sterling silver and crystal Champagne bottle from 1898, alongside a quirky 1960s Cartier flowerpot jigger. According to Bedwell, “a beautiful letter opener should be a part of anyone’s desk,” and the sale has several to offer, including an 1898 model bearing the brand “DuPont Explosives” and another created in 1970 by Hermès in a comically extended dachshund shape. An equally lively pair of French agate hamburger cufflinks from the ’70s are fun, but exquisitely crafted — each element was hand-cut, dyed and polished. The real standouts, though, act as conversation starters, like an ’80s Asprey rubber-band gun and a silver-plated peanut dish from the ’50s. “You do stumble across these amazing crazy pieces every now and then,” Bedwell says, “and you just think, ‘Wow, I can’t believe somebody actually sat down and made that.'”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/paddle8-gentlemens-accessories-sale/

During seven days centered on Benjamin Franklin’s Jan. 17 birthday, thrift advocates taught people how to open savings accounts, buy insurance, purchase homes, pay bills promptly and share with others. By the early 1920s, Thrift Week was observed by more than a thousand cities in the United States, and still more around the globe. Thrift was put forward as the antidote to many of the nation’s perceived ills: working-class radicalism, urban poverty, squandering of natural resources and excessive consumerism.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/books/review/thrift-by-andrew-l-yarrow.html

Ask your children questions; listen to their answers. So I tried it. My husband and I waylaid our 16-year-old daughter, Lucy, as she headed out the door. “How much do you think we earn every year?” we asked. Lucy, who’s a pretty smart, sophisticated kid, replied after a moment’s thought: “Maybe around $10,000?” I don’t need to have an open dialogue with you, dear reader, but I will confess that’s not quite our income.

Then, a handful of neighbors in the Chicago suburbs discovered that each had a small collection and started trading with one another. They established some informal rules: Two Tabasco the Bull Beanies were equivalent to one of the rarer Kiwi the Toucan Beanies. Their trading spread and, eventually, went national. There were articles and TV segments about moms and dads who traded a $5 toy for thousands of dollars. Peggy Gallagher, an early trader, discovered that the Beanie craze hadn’t hit Germany yet and placed an order with a distributor in Nuremberg. She paid $2,000, including shipping, for a box of the toys that, back in the United States, had a value of $300,000, a return of nearly 15,000 percent. If she were a hedge fund trader with those numbers, she’d be the talk of Wall Street for generations. Instead, she was the talk of countless parents, who came to believe they, too, could fund their kids’ college education or an early retirement if they just got their hands on the right Beanies. The frenzy coincided with the start of eBay and the rise of home Internet use. Early on, Beanie Babies represented 10 percent of eBay’s sales.

Over 35 minutes, it traces Knight’s childhood as the son of two illustrators, the creation of Eloise, his creative tussles with the “Eloise” writer Kay Thompson and a post-Eloise career that’s included work for Vanity Fair, the publication of his own books and the illustration of posters for Broadway shows like “Gypsy.” Most compelling are the scenes of Hilary moving through his magically curated home, decorated with staged bird nests, an underwater-themed bathroom and countless pieces of his parents’ work, dressing up in a full gorilla suit or directing a short musical film in his backyard.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/eloise-documentary-hbo/

Ms. Pollán’s daughter, Laura Maria Labrada, announced on Thursday that she would leave the group because of differences with its leader, Berta Soler. She said the Ladies in White could no longer use Ms. Pollán’s name or her house, which had been the group’s headquarters. Ms. Pollán died in 2011. Tensions within the group have sharpened since the Dec. 17 thaw between Cuba and the United States, which Ms. Soler opposes and Ms. Labrada supports. Members this month accused Ms. Soler of being autocratic and called for her to resign, leading to a vote on her leadership, which she won.

Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes the murder of her family by Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) and his men and runs a movie theater in Paris. When the Nazis choose her theater for the premiere of a propaganda film, Shosanna begins scheming. For more Tarantino, “Kill Bill: Vol. 2” plays at 8 on Showtime. The film follows Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) as she takes revenge on the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.

The production, staged by Bartlett Sher, conducted by Michele Mariotti and presented here by “Great Performances at the Met,” “delivers a heady fizz,” Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim wrote in The New York Times. “And it has stars,” she added — among them, Mr. Brownlee, who made “a dashing Almaviva, singing with a focused, ardent tenor”; Ms. Leonard, “a pitch-perfect Rosina, cute but sharp-clawed”; and Mr. Maltman (above right, with Mr. Brownlee and Ms. Leonard), who “oozed sex appeal during his opening aria, ‘Largo al factotum,’ wearing a magnificent red Phrygian cap like a royal insignia.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/arts/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

Although the State Department insisted that employment of the short-lived gas was not inhumane or internationally illegal, the use of the gas — with all its flesh crawling connotations of horror — may spark worldwide protests and give the United States a monumental propaganda black eye. The Soviet Union seized upon the gas issue immediately for a blast at the United States, with Moscow Radio charging the United States with ‘‘using increasingly barbarous methods — in particular waging chemical warfare.’’ It was unclear precisely what kind of gas was being used, but it apparently is the type, effective for about two hours, which causes tears, nausea, sneezing, coughing, nose, throat and chest discomfort or pains. The gas being used is not of the killing, stunning or nerve-affecting types. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 23, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/1965-saigon-forces-use-tear-gas-on-enemy/

2015-03-24,What’s on TV Tuesday,"12:30 P.M. (AMC) AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) Ridley Scott directs this Oscar-nominated crime drama set in the 1970s. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is a gangster in Harlem who finds that he can get the best heroin cheap from Southeast Asia, smuggled to the United States in the coffins of American soldiers sent from Vietnam. He calls the heroin Blue Magic and takes over the market. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an obnoxiously honest New Jersey detective. When his partner (John Ortiz) dies from an overdose of Blue Magic, Richie is asked to lead a drug trafficking task force. A corrupt New York detective named Trupo (Josh Brolin) bridges the gap between the two lead characters. “You can almost feel Mr. Scott trying to coax the material away from its generic trappings toward something rarefied, something like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 definitive American story, ‘The Godfather,’ ” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “He comes closest to that goal with the suggestion that the lethal pursuit of the American dream is not restricted to one or two families — the Corleones, say, or the Sopranos — but located in a network of warring tribes that help to obscure the larger war of all against all.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

2015-03-24,Many Will Need to Repay Health Subsidies,"Half of the households that received subsidies to help pay health insurance premiums last year under the Affordable Care Act will probably have to repay some of that money to the federal government, according to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation also predicted that 45 percent of households that received subsidies will probably get a refund, because their 2014 income was lower than what they estimated when they applied for coverage. Under the law, people can receive subsidies to help cover the cost of insurance purchased through online marketplaces if they earn between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Taxpayers generally receive subsidies in advance, with the amount based on their projected household income for the year the insurance policy will be in effect. But they must then reconcile the estimate with their actual income when filing federal taxes. Kaiser estimated that subsidy recipients who underestimated their incomes will owe $794 on average, while those who overestimated will receive average refunds of $773.

He carried a gun and, like many men of his generation, saw threats in people he didn’t understand: African-Americans, independent women, gays. By the time he died, 10 years ago, he had softened. He stopped using racist and homophobic slurs; he even hugged my gay cousin. But there was one view he wasn’t going to change. He had no time for Hispanics, he told us, and he wasn’t backing down. After all, this wasn’t a matter of bigotry. It was plain economics.

A court found that Mr. Papaconstantinou, 53, had removed the names of three relatives from the list. The list was given to him in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister, in an effort to help curb tax evasion. The court reduced the first charge against him, doctoring a document, to a misdemeanor from a felony, and imposed a one-year suspended prison term. He was cleared of a second charge of attempted breach of faith. The failure of the authorities to investigate the so-called Lagarde list, a potential source of much-needed tax revenue, fueled widespread anger in Greece during years of austerity.

Mr. Harper said that he wanted to extend the air force’s role to include strikes on targets in Syria. Opposition lawmakers say that Mr. Harper did not fully reveal the extent of the ground troops’ role last year. The criticism increased this month after Kurdish forces mistakenly killed a Canadian military adviser in Iraq. Opposition leaders said that they did not support the extension, but Mr. Harper’s Conservatives hold a majority in the House of Commons.

The poet and activist, Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, 31, was taking part in a march to lay flowers in Tahrir Square on Jan. 24 when the police fired birdshot and tear gas from a few yards away. Prosecutors charged a police officer with a form of manslaughter in the shooting but have not named the officer. The spokesman for the medical examiner, Hisham Abdel Hamid, said in a television interview on Saturday that other marchers that day survived similar blasts of birdshot but that Ms. Sabbagh died because she was “too skinny.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/middleeast/egypt-forensics-official-dismissed.html

In 2010, the company’s co-founder Tina Huber tested a prototype by putting it on her son, a second grader, and sending him to school. “At the end of the day he got back in the car, and I was like, ‘Tell me everything,’ ” Huber says. “And he goes, ‘I seriously felt like Jesus. Everybody wanted to touch me.’ ” Before long, Willow Smith started wearing one, as did the children of Ben Affleck, Hugh Jackman and Heidi Klum. While the backpacks come in many different styles, all of them look instantly iconic, combining elements of sci-fi, exotic wildlife and Memphis design — and all of them can be worn comfortably, and with confidence, on both shoulders.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/t-magazine/madpax-backpack.html

2015-03-25,What’s on TV Wednesday,"5 P.M. (Flix) TENDER MERCIES (1983) Robert Duvall, in an Oscar-winning role, plays a down-on-his-luck rambler trying to rebuild his life while staying at a ramshackle Texas motel whose proprietor, Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), he just can’t quit. Only after tying the knot with her guest does Rosa Lee learn that he used to be Mac Sledge, a country singer who drank his career to death. This drama — directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Horton Foote, who won an Oscar for best screenplay — follows Mac’s relationships with his ex-wife (Betty Buckley), his daughter (Ellen Barkin), his new bride and her son, “weaving them into a sadly contemporary vision of family life and heading toward a final note of affirmation,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals with all of these things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively small price to pay for the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

When he squawked and squirmed and bucked his little head against the arm of the rocking chair, I began to panic. I had just one job to do, to feed my baby, and I couldn’t do it. The more I tensed up, the harder it became for him to latch on, and the more both of us cried.

At the separation of the spacecraft from the rocket, there was ‘‘a sudden drop from six ‘Gs’ (the force of gravity) to one-half g,’’ he said. ‘‘There was a fair amount of debris flying around.

The 16-mile-long island of extravagant mansions, tony retailers and fanciful landscaping is rich in history and significant landmarks, from the magnificent Mar-a-Lago estate (completed in 1927 for Marjorie Merriweather Post, now Donald Trump’s private club) and the Paramount Theater (a former movie palace that houses a trove of vintage screen star photos) to St. Edward’s church (where the Kennedys worshiped) and Green’s Pharmacy (where John F. Kennedy enjoyed burgers in the luncheonette). But Palm Beach is also a small gem offering simple pleasures. You can ride a bike anywhere or linger over coffee at a lunch counter and never be more than a block or two from the beach. Even the new Orange Line trolley that shuttles riders between arts destinations in Palm Beach and neighboring West Palm Beach adds a down-to-earth touch to this high-rolling town (and it’s free!). When the season ends after Easter, parking spots and dinner reservations are readily available once again (not to mention discounted restaurant and hotel prices), making this perhaps the best time of all to visit.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-palm-beach-florida.html

(Spike) OCEAN’S THIRTEEN (2007) After Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) has a heart attack when his business partner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) pulls a fast one on him, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) gets the gang back together for a revenge plot. The gang includes characters played by Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac and others. They use gadgets and seduction to carry out their convoluted plan in this third film in a series directed by Steven Soderbergh. “Part of what makes the ‘Ocean’s’ films, even the self-indulgent second installment, so enjoyable is that they’re not only about Mr. Soderbergh’s obsessive aesthetic investment in every single shot, but they’re also about him trying to make the audience love his images every bit as much as he does,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Playing inside the box and out, he has learned to go against the grain while also going with the flow.

Cows clustered in wood-­fenced pastures next to neat farmsteads in shades of rust and ocher. On the outskirts of town, across from a road parting dark pine forest, the turnoff to Norway’s newest prison was marked by a modest sign that read, simply, HALDEN ­FENGSEL.

Ms. Hershman Leeson began her career in the San Francisco Bay Area in the culturally roiling early 1960s. Like many young artists then, she identified as a painter, but one with multimedia extensions and futuristic ambitions. Almost from the start she was also working in sculpture that had a cyborglike dimension. The small assemblage in the show called “Breathing Machine II” (1968/2011), consisting of a wax face obscured by a wig, butterflies and feathers, sighs and coughs when you draw near.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/design/lynn-hershman-leeson-origins-of-the-species.html

2015-03-27,Hayv Kahraman: ‘How Iraqi Are You?’,"Reviving once great artistic styles can be a fraught pursuit, whether or not they are part of an artist’s cultural heritage. Such styles must be transformed into something personal and contemporary that ideally also survives comparison with its inspiration. In her second solo show at this gallery, subtitled “How Iraqi Are You?” Hayv Kahraman largely pulls off this difficult feat, building on the refined figuration of Persian miniatures that are part of her Iraqi background. In Ms. Kahraman’s hands the delicacy and stylization of the source are writ large and on raw linen — evoking the pages of a Persian album — and complicated with allusions to other times, places and styles. The paintings depict pairs and groups of nearly identical women who may or may not be in a harem. Shown in conversation or listening to one of their number, these women have pale skin, gestures and becalmed features that recall both the female subjects of Renaissance painting and the powdered geisha of Japanese woodblocks. Their articulated hands seem puppetlike. Their largely strapless gowns and black bouffants seem of recent American vintage even as the fabric patterns of their gowns elaborate a veritable lexicon of Arabic geometric decoration. Ms. Kahraman has devised several stylizations of her own, especially in the ways the fabrics drape and overlap while remaining flat, and in details like eyebrows and those dark bouffants (which, for viewers of a certain age may recall Lady Bird Johnson’s hairdos).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/design/hayv-kahraman-how-iraqi-are-you.html

Aptly called “Unidentified Suspended Objects” (USOs), they consist of flat, geometric wooden elements assembled into angular, planar volumes with their outer surfaces clad in all kinds of inexpensive materials, including rubber, fake fur, leather and colored plastics. He painted their interiors, visible through skewed openings, with fluorescent colors so that they seemed to glow from within. This exhibition presents eight pieces.

The story is as simple as a parable, a campfire story, a children’s book: A faithful animal, separated from its loving owner, endures, suffers, struggles and resists while trying to transcend its brutal fate. The director, Kornel Mundruczo, has said that he was partly inspired by J. M. Coetzee’s devastating novel “Disgrace,” but the movie also invokes haunting animal classics like “Black Beauty” and “The Call of the Wild.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/movies/review-in-white-god-man-bites-dog-dog-bites-back.html

2015-03-27,What’s on TV Friday,"12 A.M. (Comedy Central) PINEAPPLE EXPRESS (2008) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (“Superbad”) wrote this comic stoner caper directed by David Gordon Green. Mr. Rogen stars as Dale Denton, a process server who loves to smoke weed to escape the tedium of his life. He witnesses a murder while smoking a joint of rare marijuana and throws it out the window of his car in a rush to flee the scene. He goes to see his dealer, Saul (James Franco), and they become paranoid that the killer (Gary Cole) will be able to identify him as the witness because of the distinct pot he had been carrying. Off they run, without confirming that they are being pursued. Danny McBride plays an eccentric, backstabbing, midlevel drug dealer, and Rosie Perez portrays a crooked cop conspiring with the murderer. And a strain of pot is named “Spanish trampoline.” Writing about the film in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said, “In the tradition of Cheech and Chong, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Ricky and Lucy, Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Smothers and Smothers, Sanford and son, Spicoli and Hand, Bert and Ernie, Riggs and Murtaugh, cops and robbers, dumb and dumber, right brain and left, peanut butter and jelly, bong hit, roach clip and Snoop Doggy Dogg comes ‘Pineapple Express,’ a stoner comedy that partakes of a gentle indie vibe before hitting the hard stuff for a major Shane Black-style blowup and meltdown.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital – have, he writes, “the best knowledge, and in some cases, the only knowledge, on Heinz’s value.” ",Blogs,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/morning-agenda-the-fine-print-in-the-heinz-kraft-deal/
2015-03-27,"‘Washington’s Revolution,’ by Robert Middlekauff","Robert Middlekauff, the distinguished historian of colonial and early America, has already written about the American Revolution in his 1982 book “The Glorious Cause,” the first volume of the ­Oxford History of the United States. Now he turns to the war’s most famous figure. George Washington was commander in chief of the American Army for almost the whole of the war (1775-83). He served at a time when there was no executive branch of government, only a one-house ­Congress to guide him. He had ­direct ­command of the war’s central theater, from coastal New ­England to Philadelphia, and he was in at the death at Yorktown. The title of Middlekauff’s new book thus has two meanings: “Washington’s Revolution” is a story of the war from one man’s point of view, as well as an account of a conflict that was that man’s to win or lose.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/books/review/washingtons-revolution-by-robert-middlekauff.html

Essbaum was a poet before she was a novelist, and she’s no stranger to the naughty bits. Her poem “On Reading Poorly Transcribed Erotica” — collected in David Lehman’s 2008 anthology “The Best American Erotic Poems: From 1800 to the Present” — begins like this: “She stood before him wearing only pantries / and he groped for her Volvo under the gauze.” In the contributors’ notes to that volume, asked to name her favorite steamy reading material, Essbaum recalls a childhood appreciation for Harold Robbins and Nancy Friday before finally settling on the Bible. “A voluptuous buffet of bawd!” she declares, singling out passages from the Song of Solomon (of course) and Jeremiah (“Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers,” Jeremiah 3:1). “But for my favorite perverse verse,” she concludes, “I’m keen to point to one that — were I equally inclined and indecorous — I might assign to particularize my own prickly proclivities: ‘There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses’ (Ezekiel 23:20).

A classically trained artist who studied under the painter Giorgio Morandi, Glaser creates instantly recognizable images — like the psychedelic silhouette he made of Bob Dylan in 1966 — that blur the line between fine art and graphic design. He has conceived book jackets for Philip Roth, album covers for Nina Simone and branding for the Winter Olympics, and in 2009, he became the first graphic designer to receive the National Medal of the Arts.

The crew members, who had been held in prison three months, were accused of mutiny after they refused to sail for France from a South American port on the first day of the war. ‘‘The case was born of an excited imagination,’’ said M. de Moro-Giafferi. ‘‘The crew has been imprisoned and slandered when all that the men wanted was an equitable judgment. The sailors maintained that they had not mutinied, but had refused to leave port under their captain, whom they considered irresponsible. Several testified they had heard the captain threaten to ‘‘run his ship aground and demolish it.’’ Politics or war conditions had nothing to do with the refusal, according to the crew. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 28, 1940 ",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/1940-crew-not-guilty-of-mutiny/

2015-03-30,Inside T’s Design Issue,"T’s latest issue examines the current state of design by looking backward — namely, to the hedonistic ’70s and oddly alluring po-mo ’80s. The onetime California home of Gerald and Betty Ford is a perfect example of this revival; its new owners have kept many of the house’s original charms (including a giant portrait of the former First Lady), while adding their own contemporary touches, to create a space that’s anything but conservative. Likewise, the purist Mark Haddawy — the co-founder of the retailer Resurrection Vintage and restorer of Modernist houses — has doubled down on his version of ’70s California cool by doing very little to his own home in Big Sur.

2015-03-30,What’s on TV Saturday,"6:45 P.M. (Sundance) SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), are having problems because of Shaun’s insistence on always doing the same thing. He likes to hang out at the pub with his friend Ed (Nick Frost) and has yet to meet Liz’s mother. After Liz dumps Shaun, he continues in his habits. Shaun and Ed are so complacent that it takes them an astonishingly long time to realize that the odd events increasing in frequency around them are the result of a zombie outbreak. Shaun and Ed find themselves in a comedic fight for survival in which zombies are fought with bad records and clumsy luck in this film directed by Edgar Wright (“Hot Fuzz,” “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World”). “There is something intrinsically ridiculous about zombie movies,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The British horror comedy ‘Shaun of the Dead’ skillfully plays off that ridiculousness by implying that Britain may already be populated with the living dead, metaphorically speaking.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-03-30,Moving Onward With Cool Passion,"Glaciers can be cool and awesome as they move inexorably onward. That may also describe Liz Gerring’s “glacier,” as presented by her Liz Gerring Dance Company. Neither a choreographic travelogue nor a geological survey, Ms. Gerring’s abstract dance demands cool passion of its eight dancers, requiring them to move with unbroken stamina but often at a far from glacial pace. Although it has nothing to do with ice and snow, “glacier” may nonetheless convey a sense of an awesome territory. Ms. Gerring has said that one of her inspirations was a memory of a visit to the vast North Dakota prairie where her mother grew up. Michael J. Schumacher’s taped score combines instruments like guitar, harp, cello, clarinet, recorder and piano with natural sounds recorded during a residency at Glacier Lake in Colorado.

The Pope stressed that the church owes an answer to the world and to men and women whose married life is too often impeded by uncertainties from developing ‘‘according to the design of God.’’ Pope Paul told over 50 members of the international commission on Saturday to ‘‘let mature what must mature, but you must understand the anguish of many souls. Work diligently without attention to criticism and  difficulty.’’ He added that the church at all times took care to give an adequate reply to the great problems facing men.

Emma Thompson is the woman who’s been looking across the table at him with disdain. She’s gone by the time he descends.

New research, well described by Brigid Schulte in The Washington Post, supports the idea that such maternal omnipresence isn’t necessary for children. “In fact, it appears the sheer amount of time parents spend with their kids between the ages of 3 and 11 has virtually no relationship to how children turn out, and a minimal effect on adolescents, according to the first large-scale longitudinal study of parent time to be published in April in the Journal of Marriage and Family,” she writes. “The finding includes children’s academic achievement, behavior and emotional well-being.”",U.S.,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/quantity-time-begets-quality-time-and-parents-spend-enough-of-both/
