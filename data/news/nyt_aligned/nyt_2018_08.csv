The measure was signed into law last year, but labor groups blocked its enactment through a petition drive that placed the measure on a statewide ballot. If voters reject the law,  the momentum of nationwide right-to-work efforts would be slowed after several neighboring states passed similar laws, and after the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union fees for public sector workers in June.

2018-08-06,"‘A Dress Is Like a Passaporto, No?’ Welcome to Pierpaolo Piccioli’s Valentino","IT WAS THE FOURTH of July in Paris, and at Maison Valentino’s fall couture show, revolution was in the air. Inside the ornate drawing rooms of the neo-Classical Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild were bursts of hypersaturated color, explosive proportions and dazzling feats of construction. Here, a gown that resembled a quivering cloud of blush-pink feathers; there, sumptuously draped, Watteau-esque garments of dusty rose and red silk. For the finale, lightweight, angel-sleeved plissé dresses in tart hues — raspberry, tangerine — swept through, the models adorned with matching floral headpieces made of chrysanthemums and orchids. There was little point in overthinking the assortment of references on display: Molly Bloom and the court of Versailles, Ziggy Stardust and classical mythology among them. Opera coats and dresses were covered in pictogramlike satin piecework depicting Pegasus and Perseus, Leda and the Swan, Europa and Taurus. This was an emotional dispatch from the domain of private fantasy, a swaggeringly exuberant collection of clothes that might make us, too, feel immortal. The show concluded with a standing ovation led by a teary, now-retired Valentino Garavani, who founded the company nearly 60 years ago. By the time Pierpaolo Piccioli, Valentino’s 50-year-old creative director, emerged to kiss his wife and embrace Garavani, any lingering questions about the purpose of couture in the 21st century seemed moot, because to ask that would be like pondering what use there is to dreaming, to believing in the impossible.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/t-magazine/valentino-creative-director-pierpaolo-piccioli.html

2018-08-07,One Wine Glass to Rule Them All,"Choosing stemware for every varietal does not interest the English wine critic Jancis Robinson. Her line includes a single mouth-blown wine glass with a generous bowl and a gently tapering tulip shape that she says can be used to serve anything: Champagne, white and red wines, sherries and ports. The glass holds a good 15.5 ounces, but a drinkable four ounces will fill it to the widest part. It’s comfortable to grasp, to swirl and to drink from. (There’s a companion stemless water glass in the same shape.) Yet when it comes to decanters, Ms. Robinson does not think one size fits all. There’s a broad-based young wine decanter that will expose the liquid to more air and soften it, and a narrower one for older wines shaped to help retain the fragile fruit and aroma. The line — designed by Richard Brendon of London — is lead-free and dishwasher safe.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/dining/wine-glass-jancis-robinson.html

But his $20 presentation for dinner at the Polo Bar is a far cry from a ballpark frank. The hot dogs — thick, juicy and with good snap — arrive on a board with condiments in silver cups, nestled in split brioche buns and topped with ketchup, mustard, sauerkraut, chopped onions, relish and a parade of pickled jalapeño slices like buttons on a cardigan. They’re made from a blend of Colorado beef and Australian Wagyu. There is a somewhat limited supply, but they should be on the menu at Chicago’s RL Restaurant and New York’s Polo Bar throughout the fall.

Give the pie at least an hour and a half, preferably longer, to cool before taking a knife to it. Hot, it tends to be mushy and prone to oozing. Before slicing, visually map out your approach, noting where you want the knife to enter and exit. Grady makes three incisions across the full diameter of the pie for a total of six portions, which she considers “a decent amount” and enough to satisfy the customers who order only pie and sweet tea for lunch.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/magazine/how-to-slice-a-pie.html

They come brightly colored in one of three shapes (there’s Gnome Without Hat, Gnome With Hole and Gnome Sleeping) and are “quasi-functional”; each is able to hold small objects on its narrow shelf. “We became interested in the history of the lawn,” says Kolb, explaining that they created the inaugural run last year for a yard-themed art exhibition he organized in Brooklyn with friends. “There’s a lot that’s been written on the subject,” he says. “From the 18th century, the lawn moved from agrarian landscape to one that privileged pleasure over productivity.” Plus, Diamantopoulou, born and raised in Greece, is perpetually intrigued by kitschy Americana, a category to which contemporary gnomes often belong. “I refer to them as guh-nomes,” she adds, laughing. “I’d never heard anyone speak about them.

The Justice Department generally does its best to avoid taking action in such a way that it might influence an election — even as the president tweets defiantly that there was “No Collusion!” Functionally, this means that voters will likely be left to make up their minds about how seriously to take the possibility of collusion without any further guidance from the special counsel’s office.

2018-08-13,"The Rise, and Hard-Won Joys, of Freshwater Surfing","Ever since the early 20th century, modern surf culture has been nearly inseparable from that of its capitals — Hawaii, Southern California and Australia — which provide the seemingly necessary ingredients of sun, sea and a certain easygoing spirit. “The trees also grow down to the salty edge of things, and one sits in their shade and looks seaward,” Jack London wrote of Waikiki Beach in a chapter about surfing in his 1911 travelogue, “The Cruise of the Snark.” But as the sport has grown in popularity — in 2020, it will make its debut in the Summer Olympics — its recipe has changed as well. With the right wet suit, you no longer need the sun, and so adventure athletes looking to escape oversaturated beach towns have over the past decades made surf spots out of less hospitable coasts: Iceland, Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula and even the Arctic. Perhaps more surprising is that, as a burgeoning cadre of enthusiasts who happen to live in landlocked areas are proving, you don’t even need sea.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/t-magazine/freshwater-surfing.html

Starting with a few simple chevron-patterned wovens produced in a small factory in Gallarate, Italy, Rosita and Ottavio Missoni pioneered the now widely used space-dying technique for yarn — still the magic ingredient in the house’s signature kaleidoscopic knits. By the time Angela was a teenager, she was shadowing her mother as she worked on runway collections, and she soon started designing accessories. Since taking over the company in 1997, Angela has continued the family’s vibrant legacy — introducing beachwear and updating the once-weighty zigzag knit with lighter Lurex yarns and gauzy constructions for evening. She’s also crystallized what it means to be Missoni: a luxe-bohemian mix of bright Amalfi-inspired colors, rich cashmeres and wools, and a lavishly layered mismatch of happy florals and crooked stripes.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/t-magazine/angela-missoni-fashion-designer-inspiration.html

The effects of the drought can be seen in satellite images, which show the green hills and rolling fields of the British countryside now scorched the color of lion fur.

The blooms represent the beginning of the valley’s growing season each year: Almond trees are first to bud, flower and fruit. At the base of the trunks sit splintered boxes — some marked with numbers, some with names, some with insignias — stacked two boxes high on a wooden pallet that fits four stacks. Inside the boxes are bees, dancing in circles and figure-eights and sometimes just waggling. With almond season comes bee season. Everyone in the valley knows when it’s bee season. There are bee-specific truckers; motels occupied by seasonal workers; annual dinners to welcome the out-of-towners; weathered pickups with license plates from Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Florida parked in front of orchards at all hours of the night.

Ms. Franklin — who died Thursday at 76 — sang in a voice that struck an ideal balance of strength and sensitivity, of roiling emotion and refined skill. Even when she hit a note with terrific force, her tone never lost its beauty. And each note brought with it a huge context. “American history wells up when Aretha sings,” President Obama wrote in an email to The New Yorker’s David Remnick for a 2016 profile of the star. “Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R&B, rock ’n’ roll — the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/arts/music/aretha-franklin-dead-best-songs.html

Bats need a warm, safe place to sleep during the day. By providing one, you become a bat landlord of sorts, which you should think of as a long-term commitment: Bats can live more than 40 years, and their babies return to where they were born. Borcherding is still monitoring boxes he built over 25 years ago. Don’t be a slumlord. “Build it to last,” says Borcherding, who uses hardwoods like white oak and black locust, exterior-grade screws and high-quality caulk to seal moisture out.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/magazine/how-to-build-a-bat-box.html

2018-08-21,New & Noteworthy,"THE CARRYING By Ada Limón. (Milkweed, $22.) Limón has a novelistic knack for scene, and the narrative lyrics in this remarkable collection, her fifth, could stand as compressed stories about anxiety and the body. “On my way to the fertility clinic, / I pass five dead animals,” one poem states. “What if, instead of carrying / a child, I am supposed to carry grief?” A MEMORY OF THE FUTURE By Elizabeth Spires. (Norton, $26.95.) Sprinkled with philosophical inquiries and Zen koans like that of the title, Spires’s contemplative sixth collection opens with delicious wordplay: A poem called “Pome” riffs on the French word for apple to imagine verse as fruitlike and alive. “Common as an apple. Or / more rare. A quince or pear,” Spires writes. “Peer in and watch it / change and darken as pomes will do.” SURGE By Etel Adnan. (Nightboat, paper, $12.95.) “In perception, redemption,” Adnan declares in this assemblage of mystical, metaphysical ideas and aphorisms, often in conversation with the dead. “We have to say yes to that fate,” she writes of mortality, “and it’s hard, the hardest.” IF YOU HAVE TO GO By Katie Ford. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) Faith and doubt — in love, in God — course through Ford’s powerful fourth book, anchored by a long sonnet sequence about the end of a marriage. “It comes, then it goes, then it never was.” FEELD By Jos Charles. (Milkweed, paper, $16.) Charles, a trans woman, turns to a sort of Chaucerian-texting hybrid in an inspired effort to find language as unstable as her experience. “Bieng a tran is a queery of crisees,” she writes, “& r brused handes r manie.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/books/review/new-noteworthy-matt-flegenheimer.html

But statistics-driven godliness isn’t the sort of perfection that fascinates Mr. Faraut.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/movies/john-mcenroe-in-the-realm-of-perfection-review.html

2018-08-22,How the Trump Administration Is Remaking the Courts,"Donald F. McGahn, the White House counsel, stood in the gilded ballroom of Washington’s Mayflower Hotel last November to address the annual meeting of the Federalist Society. He seemed humbled, even a bit awed to be delivering the Barbara K. Olson Memorial lecture, named after the conservative lawyer who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Noting some of the legal giants who gave the Olson lecture in years past, McGahn reflected, “You hear names like Scalia, Roberts and Gorsuch and then me; one of those names really is different than the rest.” Unlike previous speakers — to say nothing of many of those to whom he was now speaking — McGahn, himself a member of the Federalist Society, hadn’t attended an Ivy League law school; he went to Widener University, a “second tier” law school in Pennsylvania. He had never held a tenured professorship or boasted an appellate practice, much less a judgeship, that required him to think deeply about weighty constitutional issues; he specialized in the comparably mundane and technical field of campaign finance and election law. “But here we are,” McGahn said to the audience, almost apologetically. In 2015, Donald Trump hired McGahn to be the lawyer for his long-shot presidential campaign. Then, after Trump shockingly won the election, he tapped McGahn, who had proved his talent and loyalty during the campaign, to be White House counsel. Trump, in other words, had made McGahn’s wildest dreams come true. Now, McGahn told the Federalist Society, Trump was going to make their wildest dreams come true, too.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/magazine/trump-remaking-courts-judiciary.html

And yet, “from time to time its members decide cases where legal criteria are not in any realistic sense adequate to the task.” These decisions, among the court’s most momentous, turned on vague or ambiguous words in the Constitution, like “establishment of religion” and “due process of law,” with precedent and expert opinions on both sides. By making these rulings, the court cast itself as a “national policymaker” — and in so doing raised a difficult question: When should the justices, unelected figures in robes, reflect majority will and when should they stand for “Right or Justice” so as to protect minorities from tyranny by the majority?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/magazine/when-the-supreme-court-lurches-right.html

Escher sketch come to life, seems to float in space. In fact, it leads to the school’s historic women’s library and is one of many poetic details dating from a nine-year (1932-41) building project overseen by the 20th-century polymath Gio Ponti. Then an up-and-coming Milanese architect, Ponti was 43 when he was commissioned to update the interiors of the school’s 16th-century Palazzo del Bo as well as design an entirely new building, the nearby Palazzo Liviano. Both feature sumptuous frescoes, the most notable of which may be a 26-foot-tall scene in the Palazzo Liviano that depicts man’s pursuit of knowledge, and that Ponti painted with his daughter Lisa and artist friends Fulvio Pendini and Giovanni Dandolo. It’s a lesser-known chapter of a storied career that will be a focal point of the first major retrospective of Ponti’s work, opening in October at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.

Edgy but never trendy, Agmes is a favorite among young women who gravitate toward unapologetic minimalism — “and we have a lot of older women coming to us,” says Morgan, a fact she attributes to the brand’s bold geometry and attention to the wearer’s comfort. “We want our pieces to feel significant but not tug on your ear or get in the way.” Once limited to sterling silver, 18-karat gold vermeil and freshwater pearls, the sisters are now taking the leap into color, with a line of glass jewelry — earrings, pendant necklaces and a brooch — as well as vases, all fashioned out of handblown glass. The new collection, modeled by the conceptual artist Laila Gohar, features glass in organic shapes, with rippled surfaces evocative of silt or water.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/t-magazine/agmes-jewelry-richard-habberley-book-editors-picks.html

2018-08-29,Can Vietnam Avoid Getting Hurt in the Crossfire When the Tariffs Are Flying?,"When elephants fight, the ants perish: The Khmer proverb captures the sense of peril in the escalating trade war between the United States and China. The world’s two superpowers have locked tusks over tariffs, and the rest of the world — especially Asia — seems in danger of being trampled. As the trade war heads into its third month, with the United States set to impose a new tranche of $200 billion in tariffs this fall, expanding the conflict fourfold, one truth is clearer than ever: In a globalized economy, nothing exists in isolation. There is no such thing as a trade war of surgical strikes, in which tariffs hit their targets and leave everything around them unscathed. In its attempt to punish China for unfair trade practices and to reduce a $375 billion trade deficit, the Trump administration is also inflicting harm on some of America’s allies in Asia — forcing them, like ants under the elephants’ feet, to scramble in search of escape.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/magazine/can-vietnam-avoid-getting-hurt-in-the-crossfire-when-the-tariffs-are-flying.html

Morton continued, “As soon as I realized the mistake, I started studying art, but it was already 1965, and I had a naval officer husband, three children and a house in a middle-class neighborhood in Norfolk, Virginia.” She summarized her life story, with a winking ironic detachment, as a “feminist classic” and then went on to list some of her accomplishments: “I got a B.F.A. and an M.F.A. I learned to use power tools and to know the difference between needing help and just thinking I did. I got a teaching job in Philadelphia. I moved to a loft in N.Y.C. I learned to take myself seriously. I learned not to take myself THAT seriously. I did some good work, got some shows and some reviews.

2018-08-31,He Wrote a Memoir About Infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. Then Spike Lee Turned It Into a Film.,"In 1978, Ron Stallworth was a 25-year-old officer on the Colorado Springs police force — the first black detective in the city’s history — when he rang David Duke, then the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. That call, part of a successful, if highly improbable, seven-month undercover operation Stallworth conducted into the Klan’s local chapter, has been memorialized on film by John David Washington, who plays Stallworth in this summer’s much lauded adaptation by Spike Lee of Stallworth’s memoir, “Black Klansman” (retitled for the movie as “BlacKkKlansman”). But Stallworth’s own performance — as a black-hating white guy eager to defend the Aryan race — required some quick-witted improvisation of his own. “Undercover work is nothing more than acting,” Stallworth says. “The only difference is you don’t have a Spike Lee to say ‘Cut! Move on to the next scene.’ And there’s no danger that the person you’re talking to is going to pull a gun on you and threaten to kill you. That happened to me on more than one occasion.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/books/review/black-klansman-ron-stallworth-best-seller.html

One of the pieces on view, “Basket Chair With Brown Pillow,” resembles a head-on collision between the 19th-century German cabinetmaker Michael Thonet’s classic bentwood Chair No. 14 and the sort of metal butterfly one finds in college dorms. “I didn’t anticipate the sheer number of people and the damage they could do,” says Reaves. “But you can’t create a nuanced instruction for interaction — it can’t be, Sit gently.
