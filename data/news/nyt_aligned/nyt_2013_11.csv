The casualty estimate could not be independently confirmed. Kenya said that the training camp had been used by Shabab “operatives” who had “infiltrated” Kenya, and that it was where those who carried out the mall attack had “received their training.” A spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping mission said the attack was part of the force’s broader campaign against the Shabab.

2013-11-01,Mexico: Junk Food Tax Is Approved," Aiming to curb unhealthy consumption habits, Mexico’s Congress on Thursday approved new taxes on sugary drinks and junk food. Lawmakers approved a tax of one peso per liter, or about 8 cents, on soft drinks and an 8 percent sales tax on high-calorie foods, including potato chips, sweets and cereal. President Enrique Peña Nieto is expected to sign the taxes into law in January. The soft drink and food industries lobbied heavily to defeat the plan, but lawmakers said it was necessary to reduce rising rates of obesity and diabetes, as well as to raise revenue. Almost 70 percent of Mexicans are overweight, and about a third are obese, according to the World Health Organization. The foundation of New York City’s mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, financed an ad campaign to support the so-called soda tax. The taxes were among several revenue-raising measures approved by lawmakers, including higher taxes on the wealthy and the elimination of some breaks for industrial plants on the border with the United States, known as maquiladoras.

But the nonbinding referendum was not recognized by the governments of Sudan and South Sudan or by the African Union.

Until now, what they’d never done was try to figure out how to sell broccoli. Or any vegetables or fruits of any kind. This of course is not unique to Victors & Spoils. Major American advertising agencies tend not to get hired by produce growers to help them market fresh fruits and vegetables. They are hired by large companies making huge profits from processed foods to reach into whatever crannies of the American (or global) public they have not yet connected with. Victors & Spoils is exceedingly good at doing just that. The agency’s “Smile Back” campaign for Coca-Cola, which was released this summer, has been hailed as an ingenious use of a kind of guerrilla advertising, albeit with very slick production, composed of footage of grinning, attractive ambassadors for Coca-Cola pedaling through cities and rural areas around the globe, handing out free Cokes to anyone who smiled back.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/broccolis-extreme-makeover.html

2013-11-01,Engineered Performances,"The strange anthropological lesson of social media is that human beings, if given a choice, often prefer to socialize alone. Since the founding of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other mainstays of what technology writers have come to call “the social Web” or “Web 2.0,” a sizable portion of humanity has learned to be together while apart, sacrificing intimacy for control and spontaneity for predictability. On the Web, we can be whoever we wish to be, editing the face we show to others in ways that aren’t possible in physical space. We can also fine-tune the complexity and depth of our interactions and relationships. The result is a sense of freedom whose appeal is evident in the exponential growth of the largest social media services, but it may be a misleading sense of freedom since the tools that make it possible are, for the most part, commercial enterprises, subtly shaping our behavior in ways designed to earn profits for their proprietors.

2013-11-01,Spyware vs. Spyware,"When we hear about people’s identities being stolen — e-mail appropriated, accounts infiltrated, lives invaded and subverted — a sense of helplessness envelops us. Sure, the victims of such crimes can rebuild their virtual lives, with new account numbers, passwords, Internet providers and computers. But none of this changes the fact that the culprits are unlikely to be caught. We feel something similar when we learn of a new governmental encroachment into our privacy, as we did with the revelations Edward Snowden furnished last spring about the National Security Agency’s ability to monitor our lives online. In both instances, it’s as if everything that was once promised by the computer age — certainty, precision, safety, power — has been little more than a lie.

2013-11-01,Pushing Their Buttons,"Why do many people think that Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple are rivals? They hardly compete directly. Sure, Facebook and Google both sell targeted Web-based advertisements. But they offer such different services that they don’t share a core mission. Apple makes its money selling devices and mobile apps. Microsoft sells computer software and video game consoles. Google makes a free suite of applications that could challenge Microsoft Office. But it has not. Google also runs a social network that no one uses. And it gives away a mobile smartphone operating system. All four seem to be safely in control of distinct missions and markets.

2013-11-01,Put That Down!,"Recently, I found myself on the subway next to a young girl watching cartoons on an iDevice. She stroked its screen softly — lovingly, even — while her face relaxed in happiness. I was charmed. And terrified. We don’t yet know what, if any, the implications will be for a generation coming of age in a digital era, and the question fills even the most tech-savvy among us with a mixture of wonder and trepidation. But that is exactly what two youth-­minded researchers, Howard Gardner and Katie Davis, set out to answer in an ambitious and admirable project. Their efforts, spanning several years, have culminated in the meticulously researched and thoughtful book “The App Generation: How Today’s Youth Navigate Identity, Intimacy and Imagination in a Digital World,” which explores how young people view themselves and their relationships when smart devices are nearly ubiquitous, social rites happen via text message and the currency of popularity is traded in likes and comments on social-sharing apps.

2013-11-01,Linked In,"Social psychologists love the Prisoner’s Dilemma. They use it to demonstrate the nature of calculated self-interest, with a setup like this: There’s a reward ($10, say) to be split between two players, and what one gets depends on whether the other decides to split things fairly. If both players choose to cooperate, each gets $5. If one cooperates but the other chooses to “defect,” the cooperative player gets nothing and the defector gets all $10. If both defect, they each get a dollar. The challenge is to decide without knowing what your partner has chosen. Defecting is the safer bet: you’ll get at least $1 and possibly $10. If you cooperate, you run the risk that your partner will defect, grabbing the whole pot and leaving you looking like a chump.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/books/review/social-by-matthew-d-lieberman.html
2013-11-01,Word Travels Fast,"For nearly 20 years, we’ve thought of “new media” as the brash young upstart and “old media” as the stalwart if increasingly embattled establishment. But what if new media aren’t as new as we assume — and old media not really old at all? So argues Tom Standage in “Writing on the Wall,” a provocative book that asks us to look at media less in terms of technology — digital or analog? — than in terms of the role they invite us to play. Are we passive receptors for whatever facts, opinions and ad messages come our way? Or are we participants, sharing what we like with others, amending or commenting in the process? The second is characteristic of the Internet in general and social media in particular. But there’s nothing revolutionary about this, Standage says. Instead, it’s the role of consumer, so typical of 20th-­century mass media, that’s unnatural — and to Standage, a historical blip.

Yes, it probably has a much lower profile than it should, far lower than bigger cities like Berlin and Munich — even arguably lower than that of its nearby archrival, Cologne. Yes, its soccer team, Fortuna Düsseldorf, was recently relegated from the top division to the second Bundesliga. And no, the capital of the North-Rhine Westphalia state is not regularly considered one of Europe’s top tourist destinations. But let this be your advantage. The artsy, cultivated hometown of both the great Romantic poet Heinrich Heine and the German punk-rock legend Die Toten Hosen, Düsseldorf has more than enough attractions for a rich cultural weekend — or even longer. Although the city is celebrating the 725th anniversary of its founding this year, Düsseldorf’s real draws are to be found in its dozens of new developments: stylish contemporary architecture, impressive modern art, cool new restaurants and even new takes on altbier, the local brew that ranks among Germany’s best beer styles.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/travel/36-hours-in-dusseldorf-germany.html

I was about to undergo transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS, an experimental technique for delivering extremely low dose electrical stimulation to the brain. Using less than 1 percent of the electrical energy necessary for electroconvulsive therapy, powered by an ordinary nine-volt battery, tDCS has been shown in hundreds of studies to enhance an astonishing, seemingly implausible variety of intellectual, emotional and movement-related brain functions. And its side effects appear limited to a mild tingling at the site of the electrode, sometimes a slight reddening of the skin, very rarely a headache and certainly no seizures or memory loss. Still, I felt more than a bit apprehensive as I prepared to find out if a little bit of juice could amp up my cognitive reserves and make me, in a word, smarter.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/jumper-cables-for-the-mind.html

They’ll sit for the Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC), from CTB/McGraw, while adults in nine states can take HiSET, the new E.T.S. High School Equivalency Test. After the G.E.D.’s 72-year reign, the splintering comes as a result of an ambitious agenda: the G.E.D. being unveiled in January will align with Common Core State Standards and be offered only on computer (in sync with federal digital literacy standards for adults). Rankled that the adult demographic had not yet been exposed to these new standards — and that their costs will double, to $120 a test taker — states asked other test makers to develop something. As for the new G.E.D., it is being positioned as more than just a high school endpoint. It will now indicate test takers’ levels of performance, with an honors category for those deemed at college or career readiness. Are you ready?

2013-11-04,What’s on Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) PROMISED LAND (2012) Matt Damon, above, plays a corporate predator and staunch defender of his company’s cause — fracking, the contentious drilling technique for natural gas — who arrives in a small farming town with the belief that he is offering local landowners a lifeline. Some, hearing the amounts being offered for drilling rights, are eager to sign up. But troubles arise when an old-timer (Hal Holbrook) starts asking questions about what fracking will do to the water supply, the livestock and the land itself. Then an environmental activist (John Krasinski) appears on the scene. The movie “has a point to make, and it does so in a way that is both honorable and disappointing,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Mr. Damon and Mr. Krasinski. “It admirably tries to represent both sides of the fracking debate, even though its allegiance is clearly to the antifracking position. There is nothing wrong with such advocacy, except that in this case it means that the movie veers away from its strengths, ending in a welter of convenient (and dubious) plot twists and puffed-up speeches.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The opener was Michel Fokine’s “Les Sylphides” (1909), which used to be a signature work for Ballet Theater through most of its first five decades; when Fokine staged it for this company in 1940, it was his final version of what was already a classic.

The stockpile was discovered by chance in 2011, when tax investigators obtained a warrant to search the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of the art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt. There are international warrants out for at least 200 pieces in the collection, which is being stored in a secured warehouse in Munich.

Another new comedy, “Back in the Game” starring James Caan, did not receive an additional episode order, leaving its future in doubt after its initial 13-episode order is completed. The vote of confidence for “Trophy Wife” was something of a surprise, considering its ratings have been the lowest out of the four shows through the early part of the season. The other three have been on fairly equal ground in terms of viewership, but none could be qualified as hits. “The Goldbergs” has averaged 6.1 million total viewers; “Super Fun Night” 6.4 million; “Back in the Game” 6.7 million; “Trophy Wife” has averaged 4.7 million.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/arts/television/abc-extends-the-lives-of-some-new-sitcoms.html

2013-11-05,‘The Animated Life of A.R. Wallace’,"Although Alfred Russel Wallace made one of the most important scientific discoveries in history, he’s been all but forgotten. A contemporary of Charles Darwin, Wallace was the other guy to discover natural selection – the evolutionary process whereby better adapted organisms are more likely to survive and pass on their traits than less adapted ones. Although two people discovered this theory, evolution by natural selection is virtually synonymous with Darwin. This is partly due to the lasting fame of Darwin’s opus, “On the Origin of Species,” but some argue it is also due to Wallace’s extraordinary modesty – he lauded Darwin’s work and humbly downplayed his own contributions. In 1889 he even wrote a book in support of evolution titled “Darwinism.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/opinion/the-animated-life-of-ar-wallace.html

The first section, weighing 33 tons, was lifted off the stack Thursday for storage in the plant’s turbine hall, according to a report on the plant’s website. The work is expected to take about five weeks. The distinctive red-and-white tower is being removed to allow a new arch-shaped enclosure to be placed over the concrete sarcophagus that was built after the disaster to entomb the wrecked reactor. The arch, scheduled to be completed in 2015, will allow workers to eventually dismantle the old sarcophagus and dispose of the radioactive fuel. As part of the preparation for the work, a new, smaller ventilation stack for removing radioactive aerosols that remain in Reactor 4 was built nearby.

2013-11-07,"Dressing the Turkey? Dress the Menorah, Too.","When precocious children come up with ideas for salable inventions on long car rides, preoccupied parents typically just keep driving. But about 10 months ago, when Asher Weintraub, 9, suggested combining Thanksgiving table decorations and Hanukkah menorahs this year, since the holidays are making a rare simultaneous appearance, his parents, Anthony Weintraub and Caroline Baron, actually listened. The Manhattan family commissioned a prototype for Asher’s computer sketch of a menurkey, a menorah shaped like a turkey holding candles in its plumes. A Kickstarter campaign, also Asher’s idea, brought in $48,345 and Internet fame, and now plaster menurkeys are being sold for $50 at the Jewish Museum in New York. “When I saw it made,” Asher said, “it looked way better than I expected.” As for his next invention, he added, “Maybe an app.” Information: 212-423-3333 or shop.thejewishmuseum.org.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/garden/dressing-the-turkey-dress-the-menorah-too.html

The effect of the high court ruling is unclear; the drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, left prison Aug. 9 and may not be easy to find. The American government, which filed an extradition request for him after his release, this week offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. According to the high court ruling, lower court judges made a mistake when they decided there had been a jurisdiction problem in trying Mr. Caro Quintero in federal court and ordered his release. The new ruling allows the Mexican authorities to order him back to prison to complete the remaining 12 years of his 40-year sentence for the killing of the agent, Enrique Camarena, although Mexico could choose to extradite Mr. Caro Quintero if he is found.

He was one of the first openly gay designers, and in an era ruled by street fashion, he made being a high-fashion designer seem cool. The army of pop stars who followed in his wake, becoming designers themselves, is evidence of this, as well as the popularity of television shows like “Project Runway” and the smaller contingent of artists who have used fashion collections and runway shows as models for performance-based art works.

The newspaper said Mr. Priebke, who died last month under house arrest in Rome at the age of 100, was buried in late October. Officials at the Justice Ministry, which oversees Italy’s prison system, were unable to confirm the report. After Mr. Priebke’s death, Italian and church officials in Rome refused to allow a public funeral, and a private commemoration in a town outside the capital turned violent. Fearful that his grave would become a beacon for neo-Nazi sympathizers, officials in Italy, Germany and Argentina, where Mr. Priebke lived until he was extradited to Italy in 1995, refused to accept his body. The newspaper said that the body would eventually be released to Mr. Priebke’s two sons. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/world/europe/italy-nazi-war-criminal-buried-at-jail.html

You’d think there would be a surfeit of whistle-blowing, wheels-aturning classics in the picture-book section, shelves and shelves of them, right up there with bunny books and princesses. Trains are so wonderfully graphic, too, slashing across landscapes and barreling full speed ahead to force dramatic perspectives — after all, what is a train but a line on steroids? Funny, though, I can think of only a couple of genuine picture-book classics starring locomotives: “The Little Engine That Could” and “The Polar Express” — and maybe I should also include “Green Eggs and Ham,” because as a rule, one should always include “Green Eggs and Ham.” (“I will not eat them in the rain.

2013-11-08,Gate Crashers,"With our civic sphere dominated by social media, advertising and political pseudo-news, it’s easy to despair that cultural subversion is a thing of the past. But in Alissa Quart’s new book, “Republic of Outsiders,” we meet the often unlikely agitators who are participating in new social and cultural revolutions using the tools of what we would once have called the Man — technology, entrepreneurialism and even finance. What emerges is a hopeful, if sometimes uneven, portrait of a mainstream culture that’s constantly being rewritten by the people at its margins.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/republic-of-outsiders-by-alissa-quart.html
2013-11-08,Nation Builders,"On July 4, 2011, the British-born historian Simon Winchester took an oath to become an American citizen. It was a startling decision for someone Queen Elizabeth herself had made an officer of the Order of the British Empire not so long ago. Why the move? Winchester, it seems, was in love. But it wasn’t a woman who captured his heart. No, Winchester had fallen for an entire nation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/simon-winchesters-men-who-united-the-states.html
2013-11-08,Dispatches,"If blinded in one eye by shrapnel, many journalists would consider early retirement. At the very least they would contemplate avoiding areas known for ambushes and land mines. But Marie Colvin, one of the bravest and certainly best-dressed foreign correspondents of our time, simply turned that injury, which she sustained while reporting in Sri Lanka for The Sunday Times of London, into a style statement. After an excruciating recovery involving flashbacks of the attack, this extraordinary American reporter donned a black eye patch and returned to the field to risk her life over and over again. When she was killed by a rocket attack in Syria in February 2012 on yet another assignment, colleagues were stunned, although not exactly surprised. Colvin, after all, often arrived at the front lines first and stayed longer than others. She had been stranded on a 12,000-foot mountain in Chechnya. She was nearly lynched in Egypt. She spent half her 56 years in the world’s most brutal conflict zones. Her luck couldn’t last forever.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/on-the-front-line-and-under-the-wire.html

2013-11-08,Holding Court,"In a famous passage in Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 case establishing the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall observed that the question of whether an act inconsistent with the Constitution could stand “is a question deeply interesting to the United States, but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest.” Two hundred and ten years later, another eminent jurist has turned to questions whose intricacy matches — or exceeds — their interest. “Reflections on Judging” by Richard A. Posner, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, is about what judges should do when confronted with complexity. Like the rest of us, judges face an increasingly bewildering world, marked by daily advances in such areas as social media, the sciences and globalization. Unlike the rest of us, judges must make decisions that enforce their understanding — or misunderstanding — of that complexity onto millions. In its organization, this is a simple book. Posner recognizes that awesome charge: he decries one common response to complexity, and endorses another.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/richard-a-posners-reflections-on-judging.html
2013-11-08,A Time to Die,"My father practiced law in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., on Fiske Place, directly above the train tracks. I used to sit in his windows and shoot rubber bands onto the tops of the cars of the southbound New Haven rattling by. It took some skill. Lawyers from that building liked to point thumbs at the disembarking passengers and say they couldn’t wait to charge them “whatever the traffic will bear” — the first law joke I ever got, after it was explained — but not Dad, a Mt. Vernon boy who watched his town get blacker and poorer and allowed many clients to pay what they could afford.

2013-11-08,Watch Your Back,"Stop! Put that book down! You may think it’s time to catch up with Jo Nesbo, the Norwegian crime novelist everyone’s talking about, and you’re right. But POLICE (Knopf, $25.95) is no place to start. This densely plotted story, translated by Don Bartlett, is one of Nesbo’s darkest and most disturbing, the tale of a serial killer with a taste for the macabre who observes the anniversary of each of his murders by luring a police detective to a gruesome death at the scene of the very crime the officer failed to solve. The chills are palpable in this nerve-­racking thriller, but key narrative elements and several characters are straight out of Nesbo’s previous novel, “Phantom,” which begs to be read first.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/jo-nesbos-police-and-more.html

2013-11-08,Beauties and Beasts,"With their violent excesses and winning magic, fairy tales once entertained adults and children together. As John Updike said, they were the television and pornography of an earlier age, and they rarely pulled punches, even when the young were listening in. Today, fairy tales move on two different tracks: films like “Snow White and the Huntsman” and television series like “Once Upon a Time” add existential torment, surreal plot twists and macabre special effects for their adolescent and adult audience, while adaptations for children tame the tales’ original melodrama and impose moral lessons on their plotlines.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/tales-from-the-brothers-grimm-and-more.html
2013-11-08,Vanishing Acts,"Mila and her father, Gil, are about to embark on a trip from London, where they live, to the United States, where Mila’s father’s best friend, Matthew, lives. The trip has been planned for months, but just as they’re ready to leave, Matthew’s wife phones to tell them Matthew has vanished. Should they go on the trip anyway? They decide they will, but now the trip is no longer a vacation, but a missing-person investigation. So begins Meg Rosoff’s “Picture Me Gone,” a melancholy and ruminative book that is part travelogue, part mystery and part coming-of-age for Mila. Mila is a rarefied sort of narrator, familiar to certain parts of Rosoff’s adopted London and to places like New York City, if not many other locations. Mila is the only child of a ­Swedish-Sudanese orchestra-musician mother and a father who translates Portuguese into English; they came to parenthood late, never marrying.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/picture-me-gone-by-meg-rosoff.html
2013-11-08,In a Cold Country,"“The power of glaciers is waning,” we’re told in Tone Almhjell’s first novel, a fanciful tale for children called “The Twistrose Key.” This suggests a story with worldly and timely concerns — the specter of climate change — but only three of the book’s 41 chapters take place in our world and time. The others are set around Sylveros, an enchanted town nestled within the Palisade of Thorns. Outside the palisade, Nightmares roam. Inside, Petlings predominate. These are human-size, upright-walking, talking animals that were “once the favorite pet of a human child.” “The Twistrose Key” is a fantasy of the alternative-and-contiguous world sort, in which events in our world may influence theirs, and vice versa.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-twistrose-key-by-tone-almhjell.html
2013-11-08,Rough Waters,"“My dad is mega rich,” Amy Fields, the 17-year-old narrator of Nick Lake’s second novel, tells readers early on. This bit of information, along with most everything she has to say about her father, is delivered with the simpering brand of scorn reserved for teenagers discussing their parents. Amy, an only child and in her final weeks at a girls’ school in London, is a prickly misfit of the highest order — one part Holden Caulfield, one part Lisbeth Salander. And she’s got plenty to be mad about: Her mother, who suffered from depression, committed suicide two years earlier. Her father, managing director of an investment bank, has disappeared into his work, installing a young and vacuous new wife in the family manse.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/hostage-three-by-nick-lake.html

2013-11-08,Running the Rhymes,"As expectant parents in the mid-1940s, a donnish English couple named Iona and Peter Opie became curious about the origins and back stories of the Mother Goose rhymes they recalled from childhood and would soon be reciting to their own newborn. When their “Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes” finally appeared in 1951, it caused a stir, not only by validating childhood lore as a serious field of study but also by making the case for the rhymes as literature that generations had remembered less for their nonsense than for their nutshell artistry and usefulness in everyday life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/marc-browns-playtime-rhymes-and-more.html

And it’s not the most accessible, either. It’s crowded with genealogy and tangents, and written in a style that’s hard to understand. Yet what can we do? We Jews have only this one set of Scriptures to go on. Two new books provide sometimes unconventional interpretations of the Torah and Jewish folklore, and with them, a view into what their authors find to be the most exciting and poignant parts of the traditional texts.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/with-a-mighty-hand-and-the-barefoot-book-of-jewish-tales.html

When she faces the apparent failure of her efforts only halfway through the first day of school, she quickly replaces that plan with another: She’ll commit suicide.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/this-song-will-save-your-life-by-leila-sales.html
2013-11-08,Acting Like Animals,"It’s not always easy to follow your heart. It can mean challenging the status quo, defying others’ expectations or, sometimes, discovering that those harboring strong preconceptions had you pegged correctly all along. And while children learn early on that a leopard can’t change his spots, it’s equally important to remember that each pattern is unique. Three new picture books explore the nuances of individuality through the exploits of feral creatures who aren’t always what they appear to be — except, of course, when they are.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/how-to-hide-a-lion-by-helen-stephens-and-more.html

In “The Real Boy,” magic is unruly, and legends feel steady under the feet until a new bit of information rolls in like thunder and unsettles history.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/the-real-boy-by-anne-ursu.html

Frankweiler,” the Newbery Medal-winning children’s classic published in 1967. In that wry tale, a strong-willed 11-year-old girl and her little brother flee perceived “injustices” in their comfortable suburban home, journeying by commuter train from Connecticut to Manhattan, where they take up residence in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

2013-11-08,Daring Deeds,"What with all the attacks by gnarly surfer pirates, scuba ninjas and unctuous underwater TV hosts, “Treasure Hunters” sure makes sailing sound exhausting. But it can’t be as exhausting as being James Patterson, who has multiple adult, young adult and middle-grade series coming out simultaneously. He does have help. “Treasure Hunters,” Patterson’s latest middle-grade novel, was written with his frequent collaborator Chris Grabenstein; another writer, Mark Shulman, and an illustrator, Juliana Neufeld, are also credited inside. As befits the number of human beings involved, the book is pretty jam-packed. The siblings Bick, Beck, Tommy and Storm have grown up on a 63-foot sailboat, helping their father, a famous oceanographer, dredge up Spanish galleons, sunken Ming dynasty pottery and diamond-encrusted Cypriot artifacts. But when their mother disappears in Cyprus and their father is washed overboard, the kids have to keep the vessel and the family treasure-­hunting business afloat while escaping from all sorts of villains including, but not limited to, an arms dealer who collects Grecian urns; “Ukranian knuckle-draggers”; and a vicious coed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/treasure-hunters-and-the-very-nearly-honorable-league-of-pirates.html
2013-11-08,No Man’s Land,"In his great poem “Don’t Cry, Darling, It’s Blood All Right,” Ogden Nash skewers the notion that children want to read books that are comforting and sweet: “Hard-boiled, sophisticated adults like me and you / May enjoy ourselves thoroughly with ‘Little Women’ and ‘Winnie-the-Pooh,’ / But innocent infants these titles from their reading course eliminate / As soon as they discover that it was honey and nuts and mashed potatoes instead of human flesh that Winnie-the-Pooh and Little Women ate.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/books/review/great-american-dust-bowl-and-donner-dinner-party.html

In fact, Scottoline started writing later than Grisham or Turow, and was goaded in part by their work. “I liked it,” she said, “but I thought to myself, ‘There’s a lot of books about male lawyers.

The event, which this year honored Turrell (whose “Aten Reign” illuminated the museum all summer) and Christopher Wool (whose career-spanning exhibition is on view now), centered around Hawtin’s pulsing installation, which gave a nod both to the history of rave culture and to the kinds of cross-genre artworks the museum supports (including the Performa piece by Florian Hecker coming to the museum this very weekend).As Hawtin slid up and down the scales, with pops, zips and plastic sounds, the tower produced synchronized light projections.

2013-11-11,The 21st Century Silver Spoon,"In 1899, the sociologist Thorstein Veblen scathingly critiqued what he called the “conspicuous consumption” of America’s upper class. The rich were so obsessed with their social status, he wrote, that they would go to gratuitous lengths to signal it. His famous example was silver flatware: handcrafted silver spoons, though no more “serviceable” than and hardly distinguishable from aluminum ones, conferred high social rank and signaled membership in what he called the “leisure class.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/the-21st-century-silver-spoon/

But the issue never gets much traction, and one reason is the perception that it’s politically hopeless: Republicans would never go for such a program. My Sunday column tries to push back at the assumption that it’s hopeless and notes that one of the leaders in providing pre-K in America is–not Massachusetts, not New York, not some other blue state, but reliably red Oklahoma. It’s all the more surprising because Oklahoma spends less per pupil on education than almost any other state, and pays its teachers near the bottom. This is not a state that believes in lavish spending on schooling. Yet, quite remarkably, it provides universal high-quality pre-K, with a ratio of no more than 10 students per staff member, and all teachers have a college degree.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/the-oklahoma-model-for-american-pre-k/

In that piece, I talked a bit about the idea of a “religious center” — meaning a way of being religious that’s simultaneously modern and devout, engaged with contemporary realities but still rooted in a recognizably Biblical worldview – and argued that since the 1960s it’s become harder for believers of any traditional faith to claim that kind of ground. The tendency, instead, has been toward either toward a kind of separatism and retrenchment on the one hand, or accommodation and then often dissolution on the other – and this has been true for Jews and Protestants as it has been for Catholics.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/the-francis-era-synthesis-or-civil-war/

They have visited more than 400 studios and artists so far, in dozens of cities, but also in rural places so small that the roads to them have not shown up on the curators’ GPS devices. “We’ve come to recognize that many extraordinary artists may be known in their own locales, but have yet to emerge on the national stage,” Mr. Alligood said. “Their work, however, deserves consideration from a national audience.” “State of the Art” could be seen as a traditionalist alternative to a show like the Whitney Biennial, but there are currently no plans to make it a recurring event.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/arts/design/art-survey-planned.html

The discovery adds credence to the prevailing theory that the virus originates in bats but usually reaches humans through camels. In three earlier clusters of MERS cases, the first patient to fall ill in each was reported to have had contact with a sick camel. Although antibodies to the disease had been found in camels before, the virus itself had not. Genetic tests will be done, the ministry said, to see if the camel’s strain is identical to that found in the patient, a 43-year-old man in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, who is still hospitalized. MERS has killed 64 people since it was first isolated a year ago, 53 of them in Saudi Arabia. It can also spread from human to human, but seems to do so less readily than SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — did.

2013-11-12,Russia: Four Are Sentenced for Airport Attack," The Moscow Regional Court sentenced three men on Monday to life in prison for their role in the 2011 suicide bombing at the Domodedovo airport in Moscow that killed 37 people and wounded 172, the court said. The men, Bashir Khamkhoyev and the brothers Islam and Ilez Yandiyev, were convicted of providing explosive materials to the bomber, Magomed Yevloyev, 20, and for organizing his stay in Moscow before the January attack. A fourth man, Akhmed Yevloyev, the bomber’s brother, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Doku Umarov, the leader of an Islamist terrorist group carrying out an insurgency in the country’s North Caucasus region, later claimed responsibility for the bombing. Mr. Umarov, who remains a fugitive, has since called on his followers to disrupt the 2014 Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in Sochi, a resort city on the edge of the turbulent region.

That is the argument that the boycott is wrong because it is selective, because it singles out Israel when there are so many other countries in the world whose policies and actions are just as bad or worse. Actually, this is not an argument; it is a debating point (as some who offer it know): it is a form of reductio ad absurdum, the rhetorical trick of extending an opponent’s claim until it yields an absurd result, in this case the absurd result that follows if we are required to break off relations with universities housed in nations whose human rights record we find questionable: on this reasoning, we would have to break off relationships with everyone and there would be no academic exchange at all.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/opinion/fish-boycotting-israeli-universities-part-two.html

The move came a day after Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands, where the ship is registered, expressed hope for a diplomatic resolution to the case but indicated that it could still be weeks away. Russia’s investigative committee explained the transfers by saying that the courts in Murmansk did not have jurisdiction over the hooliganism charges the 30 face and that the investigating body in charge of the case was in St. Petersburg. The Netherlands has appealed to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for the release of the crew and the ship. The court’s decision is scheduled for Nov. 22, but Russia has said it would not accept its jurisdiction in this case.

A new book, “The Houses of Louis Kahn” (Yale University Press, $65), provides an architectural bridge between the personal and the professional stories, focusing on the nine houses Kahn completed, and designs for two dozen more. The story told by the authors, George H. Marcus and William Whitaker, is one of warm client relations, attention to the smallest domestic detail and a philosophical search for the best arrangement of rooms to call home.

Let her transport you back to the turn of the 20th century, to a time when this country had politicians of stature and conscience, when the public believed that government could right great wrongs, when, before truncated attention spans, a 50,000-word exposé of corruption could sell out magazines and galvanize a reluctant Congress. The villains seemed bigger, too, or at least more brazen — industrial barons and political bosses who monopolized entire industries, strangled entire cities. And “change” was not just a slogan. “There are but a handful of times in the history of our country,” Goodwin writes in her introduction, “when there occurs a transformation so remarkable that a molt seems to take place, and an altered country begins to emerge.” The years covered in this book are such a time.

So far 25 works have been posted. “Possible rightful claimants can now more quickly identify missing art works and in relevant cases make their claims heard,” the statement said.

Those movies are intimate and unsettling visits with some of the chief monsters of the 20th century: Hitler, Lenin and Hirohito. What links them is a lust for power at once madly destructive and profoundly lonely.

2013-11-15,You May Already Be a Winner. Or Not.,"It may or may not be a coincidence that Alexander Payne’s new film, “Nebraska,” shares its name with Bruce Springsteen’s austere album from 1982. Nebraska is a roomy state, and Mr. Payne, born and raised in Omaha, has set three of his previous features at least partly in it (“Citizen Ruth,” “Election” and “About Schmidt”). But to my ear, at least, a specific Springsteenian echo announces itself early and deepens as this movie winds from Billings, Mont., across the Badlands and toward Lincoln, stopping for a while in the tiny and fictitious hamlet of Hawthorne. Beyond the folky intonations of the fiddle-and-guitar waltz (by Mark Orton) that accompanies the opening images (shot by Phedon Papamichael) and beyond the bleak beauty of the images themselves, there is something in the movie that brings to mind the haunting last line of the album’s title track: “Sir I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/movies/nebraska-directed-by-alexander-payne-stars-bruce-dern.html

The graffiti read “Regards from Eden, revenge!” apparently a reference to Eden Atias, the soldier who was stabbed on a bus in northern Israel. The house, belonging to the Dar Khalil family, which has no known connection with the stabbing, was set on fire as the parents and five children slept inside. They escaped without serious injury. The Israeli police said an investigation was underway. Also Thursday, Israeli warplanes attacked two concealed rocket launchers in northern Gaza after two rockets fired from Gaza landed in southern Israel, according to the military.

The priest, identified by the government as Georges Vandenbeusch, was taken by “bandits” who had unsuccessfully sought to open a monastery safe, according to Henri Djongyang, a priest who said he witnessed the kidnapping, which he recounted on the French radio station Europe 1.

2013-11-15,What’s on Friday,"5:45 P.M. (Sho2) OUT OF SIGHT (1998) In this slick noir caper directed by Steven Soderbergh and based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, Jack Foley (George Clooney, above), the most charming bank robber you will ever meet, escapes from prison to join his partner (Ving Rhames) for one last heist: to rob the home of their former prison mate (Albert Brooks). Along the way they cross paths with Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), a federal marshal who becomes caught between attraction and professional responsibility when she and Jack begin to wonder what could happen if only they had different occupations. “The hard-boiled beauty of the cinematography (by Elliot Davis, who has shot three previous Soderbergh films) brings out the story’s own innate color and creates a warmly inviting backdrop for the central star-crossed romance,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “The film’s sleek moodiness and visual sophistication are so effective that there’s even a scene here that makes Detroit look like the most romantic city in the world.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

The volume contains, alongside a lightly corrected transcription, a facsimile of the Sterling notebook in which Flannery O’Connor, just 20 years old, began a journal addressed to God. Written in her neat hand, it is reproduced complete with the empty final pages (her concluding words are “there is nothing left to say of me”) and not omitting a bit of musical notation floating on the inside of the back cover. The prayers, attempts at prayer and meditations on faith and art contained in it were written in 1946 and 1947, while O’Connor was a student in Iowa. The brilliance that would make her fictions literary classics is fully apparent in them. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/books/review/flannery-oconnors-prayer-journal.html

(Note to self: Avoid Kaliningrad.) At the time he was nabbed, the translator was carrying a notebook he’d used at a session of multilingual, high-stakes business negotiations. His abductor, flipping through the pages, was infuriated to find them filled with illegible doodles — stars, bugs, cats and spirals — the translator’s own private code. “Let the birds read it,” the butcher declared, flinging the notebook into the wind.

Apparently the custom spread from ancient Rome throughout medieval Europe as a politically fraught pantomime of chastity’s death at the marriage altar: The new wife, presumably reluctant to relinquish her virginity, had to be physically transported into her new matrimonial setting by her impatient husband.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/books/review/dirty-love-by-andre-dubus-iii.html
2013-11-15,Running Battles,"It’s a rare memoir that begins by telling you it’s been told several times before, but that’s the case with “The Death of Santini.” The very title of Pat Conroy’s latest book, alluding to his novel “The Great Santini,” affirms that the abusive fighter pilot at the center of that story and the father mourned here are essentially one and the same. To dispel any lingering doubt, Conroy announces at the outset that the fictions he has spun over his long, celebrated literary career aren’t really fictions. They’re diamonds hauled up to earth and into the light of day from the dark and bottomless mine of his Southern clan: the tyrannical patriarch, the wounded matriarch, their seven self-destructive sons and daughters. We’ve met their alter egos and avatars, those of us who’ve supped contentedly on Conroy’s big-flavored prose through the years. In “The Death of Santini,” he more or less acknowledges that we’ll simply be reintroduced to them by their real names.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/books/review/pat-conroys-death-of-santini.html

2013-11-15,Battle-Shocked,"It’s no surprise Dennis McFarland chose the Battle of the Wilderness as the contextual scaffolding for his searing, poetic and often masterly new Civil War novel, “Nostalgia.” The intense three-day campaign, fought in Northern Virginia in May 1864, was the first showdown between the armies of Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, and the casualties on both sides were staggering. It marked the beginning of Grant’s Overland Campaign, a strategy that eventually led to the sieges of Petersburg and Richmond and the defeat of the Confederacy. Yet details of the battle remain as shrouded as the thick forests in which it occurred. There were few brilliant maneuvers, few heroes remembered by history, and no clear winner. What a perfect setting, then, for a novel exploring the chaos of war and the confounding disorientation of its aftermath.

One key to Goodwin’s popularity as a historian has been her ability to spot overlaps between contemporary politics and the distant past — or even to create those overlaps herself, through the strength of her storytelling; when Barack Obama tapped his primary opponents Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton for important posts in his administration, he cited Goodwin’s account of Lincoln’s cabinet, “Team of Rivals,” as one influence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/inside-the-list.html

(“One Does Not Joke About Finnick’s Casting” was the title of one of many obsessed Tumblr pages.) Sam Claflin, 27, won the part, which still seems to be sinking in for this classically trained British actor. Pre-Finnick, his biggest credits were minor roles in “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” and “Snow White and the Huntsman.” Now he has a more central role in a thriving power franchise.

2013-11-15,"The Gun Report: November 15, 2013","* The first 3D-printed gun, the “Liberator .380,” the design of which is widely available online, could emerge as a national security threat when a law banning undetectable firearms expires next month. The Undetectable Firearms Act, first passed in 1988, requires guns to have enough steel to set off a metal detector, but the Liberator uses only the smallest bits of metal for ammunition and a firing pin the size of a roofing nail. Some senators have proposed an updated version of the bill that would ban the design, manufacture, sale, import, export and possession of the plastic guns. The blueprint for the Liberator .380 has been downloaded 100,000 times since it was designed last year. “The fact that anyone with the right equipment can make a fully-functioning weapon from their own home with the click of a mouse is a truly frightening concept,” Sen. Bill Nelson said in a statement.",Opinion,https://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/the-gun-report-november-15-2013/

2013-11-18,Why Food Stamps Are a Great Investment,"My Sunday column looks at the issue of food stamps, subject of a forthcoming battle on Capitol Hill. The program will be cut, but it’s unclear by how much. My column argues that it would be short-sighted, as well as cruel, to slash the program, for a couple of reasons. First, almost two-thirds of recipients are children, elderly or disabled. Second, particularly with the children who are recipients, the malnutrition is real and there is mounting evidence that it has long-term effects that leave those children less equipped to succeed at school and live productive lives. I’m particularly swayed by the NBER study that my column cites and links to, indicating that when children under five get food stamps, their long-term health outcomes are better, and they are less likely to end up on welfare. Read the column, but I’d also encourage you to read the study.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/why-food-stamps-are-a-great-investment/

It was 1988, he was 32 and, for the first time, had an 1,100-seat opera house, an orchestra and a costume department at his disposal. He used it all with relish. “L’Allegro,” which returns to Lincoln Center this week, wasn’t immediately acclaimed by the local critics. (Mr. Morris’s biographer, Joan Acocella, quotes one review: “Where is the profundity?”) But it has become Mr. Morris’s most famous piece, celebrated for its innocence, exuberance and how it suggests the physical embodiment of ideal worlds. The work is set to the 1740 Handel oratorio from which it takes its title, and which uses the texts of Milton’s “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso,” portraits of the joyful and contemplative minds. Filled with nymphs and shepherds, gods and humans, hunters and lovers, the dance is beautiful, lavish and funny. It is, as Ms. Acocella writes, “a hymn to the unity of poetry, music and dance.” (7:30 p.m. Thursday to Saturday, David H.

Mr. Bays said the show would feature a new setting and new characters. The pilot will put a female spin on the original concept and is to be written by Emily Spivey, who created the NBC comedy “Up All Night.” It’s no surprise that CBS want to keep “How I Met Your Mother” going in some form.

It returned with little fanfare both critically and in the ratings — the last three episodes of Season 3 on AMC hovered around 1.5 million total viewers — and was promptly canceled again in September. “The Killing” was originally based on the Danish series “Forbrydelsen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/arts/television/fresh-life-via-netflix-for-the-killing.html

Alexander Wang designed it that way, working closely with his longtime friend and collaborator, the interior designer Ryan Korban, to turn the bilevel space on Mercer Street into something that felt like it had already stood the test of time. “I wanted to mix modern and classical materials to create a timeless space,” said Wang, who cited historic museums as inspiration for the store, his first as the brand’s creative director. The interiors are also a testament to Wang’s point of view for the brand, full of references to his debut collection for Balenciaga, which took place on a faux marble runway back in February. Even the chairs that dot the grand, open floor plan — which also includes several intimate rooms that each house different kinds of goods (ready-to-wear in one room, shoes in another, etc.) — have been upholstered in the same black “caviar” embroidery he applied to gowns in the fall 2013 collection. Combined with the sofas, they seem to beg shoppers to stay awhile. “I thought back to the time of the couture salon presentations in the Cristobal Balenciaga era, when clients had the luxury of time to view fashion in a leisurely way, but with an elevated sense of ceremony,” Wang said. The Balenciaga flagship opens on Nov. 22; 148 Mercer Street; (212) 206-0872.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/in-store-balenciagas-newest-oldest-looking-store/

2013-11-19,After Hours | An Irishman’s Inner Marcel Proust,"Bush Moukarzel’s first line in the one-man play “Souvenir,” now playing at the Abrons Arts Center in New York, is, “For a long time, I went to bed early.” It’s also the very famous first line of Marcel Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past,” published a century ago this year. Moukarzel’s hourlong piece, which was a sold-out hit in Dublin and London for the theater company Dead Centre, aims not so much to relive Proust’s epic, seven-volume story of social climbing, desire and memory as to distill its yearning, nostalgic essence into fragments of narrative and images. When the show begins, Moukarzel is running on a treadmill, his back to us, instantly conjuring images of being borne back ceaselessly into the past (or, stuck in the present). A giant diptych of Proust hangs overhead. Everywhere, there’s a clutter of half-opened packing boxes, marked cheekily with labels like “Mum,” “Apologies, “Bacon,” “Broken Glass” and (inevitably) “Madeleines.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/after-hours-an-irishmans-inner-marcel-proust/

Kenyan officials say they believe they have determined the identities of the four attackers who stormed the mall. All four of the men are Somali citizens, though one of the men, previously identified as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, grew up in Norway. Remains recovered from the mall that are believed to be those of the attackers are still undergoing forensic testing at an F.B.I. laboratory, the Western official said. A Somali militant group, the Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack. The four men entered the country from Somalia in June and lived in Nairobi’s Somali neighborhood, Eastleigh. Kenyan authorities initially said that up to 15 assailants were involved in the attack, but only four are visible on mall surveillance tapes. Four other men have been charged as accomplices.

2013-11-19,Chile: Former President’s Coalition Kept in Check," Former President Michelle Bachelet, a socialist who is favored to win a runoff election in December against a conservative candidate, Evelyn Matthei, was unable to elect enough lawmakers from her coalition to pass sweeping political proposals, but she still may be able to push through many of her social and economic policies if she is elected. Although the conservative Alliance bloc lost a considerable number of representatives in the lower house, its members retained their seats in the Senate, making it difficult for Ms. Bachelet’s New Majority coalition to pass constitutional amendments or overhaul the electoral system. Ms. Matthei’s far-right party, the Independent Democratic Union, suffered a serious blow in the lower house, losing nine of its 38 seats, while the Communist Party doubled its seats to six. Fewer than half of Chile’s potential 13.5 million voters turned out for the presidential election, the first one after voting was made voluntary.

Egyptian officials have attributed the attacks to Islamist extremists retaliating for the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi and the repression of his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood.

2013-11-19,Central African Republic Stirs Concern," Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, raised the possibility on Monday that thousands of international peacekeeping troops in Africa might have to be temporarily redeployed in the Central African Republic, one of the most unstable on the continent. In a dire report, Mr. Ban said an African Union force that was set to assume peacekeeping and security responsibilities in the Central African Republic might not be ready in time for its December deployment schedule. If there were a “precipitous deterioration,” Mr. Ban said, the United Nations could respond by moving soldiers from neighboring peacekeeping missions, like those in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Sudan, with the approval of the Security Council and countries contributing troops. Outside Bangui, the capital, government authority is nonexistent, Mr. Ban said, and clashes between rebels and their opponents have become increasingly brutal and sectarian. “This cycle, if not addressed now, threatens to degenerate into a countrywide religious and ethnic divide, with the potential to spiral into an uncontrollable situation, including atrocity crimes, with serous national and regional implications,” he said.

(IFC) JACKIE BROWN (1997) Pam Grier, above, stars as Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who makes ends meet by smuggling money from Mexico to the United States for a gun dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L.

When she is caught by a government agent (Michael Keaton), Jackie seeks to escape her menial existence with the help of a kindly bail bondsman (Robert Forster). “Among the best news about the film is that Samuel L. Jackson’s role is even splashier than the one he had in ‘Pulp Fiction’ and that his performance is even more of a treat,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “The film more than justifies its long, happy stretches of simply watching Ordell work his scams on the unsuspecting.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

He had just offered an impassioned rendition of this tormented piece, composed in 1943 after Shostakovich had been evacuated during the Siege of Leningrad. The composer dedicated the work to an important mentor, his teacher Leonid Nikolayev, who had died the previous year. Mr. Mustonen played the opening movement’s frenzied surges with powerful clarity, beautifully contrasting them with the yearning melody that unfolds between demonic outbursts. He brought a searching insight to the second movement Largo, with an emotionally subdued character that offers a respite between the angst of the outer movements. Mr. Mustonen’s judicious use of pedal and vivid touch created an impressive range of colors in the turbulent concluding section, in which a ruminative melody unfurls over rumbling bass chords and later, in the left hand, under intense right-hand patterns.

2013-11-21,What’s On Thursday,"8 P.M. (IFC) EYES WIDE SHUT (1999) A doctor (Tom Cruise), enraged by the desire of his wife (Nicole Kidman, above, with Mr. Cruise) for another man, embarks on an odyssey of sexual temptation in this final film by Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Arthur Schnitzler’s “Traumnovelle” (“Dream Story”). Open-ended vignettes star Sydney Pollack as the unsavory host of a lavish Christmas party, Alan Cumming as a conspiratorial hotel concierge, Rade Sherbedgia as the proprietor of a costume rental shop, and Leelee Sobieski as his naughty daughter. “There is consolation for having to read the words ‘The End’ on the posthumous work of Mr. Kubrick: this astonishing last film is a spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Despite some abrupt editing in a work that the director never lived to fine-tune, the film moves effortlessly, and it goes straight under the skin. Its powerful and lingering resonance attests to a final compassion and profundity in Mr. Kubrick, the body-and-soul commitment of Mr. Cruise and Ms. Kidman, and the Rorschach-like ability of this material to envelop audiences in ways unexplained and unexpected.” She added: “ ‘Life goes on,’ Mr. Pollack’s character says cynically late in the film. ‘It always does, until it doesn’t.’ Along with that sentiment, Mr. Kubrick left one more brilliantly provocative tour de force as his epitaph.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

In the years following, though, he had starred in only two live-action films (and provided a voice for the cartoon “ParaNorman”). His most recent and notorious creative project was in 2010, when he poured his heart, brain and wallet into “I’m Still Here,” a passion project he made with his brother-in-law and close friend, Joaquin Phoenix. The hoax-documentary purported to chronicle Phoenix’s real-life personal implosion, as he supposedly made the switch from acting to a rap career. The film not only met with many terrible reviews but actually seemed to enrage the media. Dana Stevens of Slate had a not untypical critical reaction: “The worst thing about ‘I’m Still Here’ is the fact that it exists.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/magazine/casey-affleck-should-be-more-famous.html

Escort, however, has been flying that flag for over half a decade. Founded by Cho and the guitarist Dan Balis, the band hails itself as “Brooklyn’s finest disco orchestra” — mixing mirror-ball rhythms and funky cowbell syncopation with club-ready choruses, as heard on the single “Barbarians,” from their forthcoming sophomore album, out next year. The song’s lush textures call to mind Studio 54 classics mixed with the legendary producer Trevor Horn’s work in the mid-1980s with Frankie Goes to Hollywood. “It’s not reasonable to expect everyone who listens to us to know the last 30 years of dance-music history,” Cho says. “We want what we do to translate broadly.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/listen-up-a-brooklyn-disco-orchestra-unleashes-its-inner-barbarian/

Now — when newer bands from Beach House to the xx have also embraced the still-waters-run-deep aesthetic — Mazzy Star harks back to its earlier self.

There the reflections debate their mistress’s charms and caprices, as well as their own deficiencies of character. And they plot their escape. The hero of another story, a writer, composes a tale about a hermit whose prayers temporarily close all the cracks in the world — potholes, mountain gorges, facial wrinkles, even “the cranial seams hidden under the skin on people’s heads.” After reading the yarn to some indifferent friends, the writer is visited by an enthusiastic scientist, a reincarnation of the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who claims that reality itself, the entire space-time continuum, is no less cracked than our everyday world, riddled with gaps and intermittencies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/sigizmund-krzhizhanovskys-autobiography-of-a-corpse.html

Still, his own collection of stories was different, and he felt he had a “good gambling chance to sell.” For his work, he thought, would “be praised by highbrows and can be read by lowbrows.

2013-11-22,What’s On Friday,"2 P.M. (Showtime) STAGE BEAUTY (2004) In this high-end costume drama about theater in 17th-century England, directed by Richard Eyre and based on a play by Jeffrey Hatcher, Billy Crudup, above, portrays Ned Kynaston, among the last of the old-school female impersonators and a specialist in doomed Shakespearean heroines. Claire Danes is Maria Hughes, who starts out as his stage-struck dresser and later becomes his rival as women are allowed to appear onstage. Rupert Everett hams it up as King Charles II; and Tom Wilkinson is Othello to Ned’s Desdemona. “For about two-thirds of its length ‘Stage Beauty’ is propelled by a complex and fascinating set of ideas about sexual identity and theatrical performance,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But as it rushes toward an upbeat ending, the movie at once recoils from this notion and bizarrely succumbs to its logic. In disowning drag and in straightening out Ned Kynaston, ‘Stage Beauty’ — absurdly for a work that professes to revel in the love of theater — takes a literal-minded stand for the straight and narrow in both sex and art.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

But can she help Tom, who has had writer’s block since the publication of his first book? “Although Mr. Pawlikowski often shows Mr. Hawke in medium and long shots, the actor draws you close,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “There’s anguish in Tom’s face that speaks of a terrible fragility and that leavens the story’s mysterioso proceedings with a real, recognizable humanity.” In “The Words” (2012), at 9, Dennis Quaid plays Clay Hammond, a successful author whose new novel tells the story of Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), a writer turned supervisor at a literary agency who comes upon an unsigned manuscript in a satchel that his wife (Zoë Saldana) gave him and decides to pass the work off as his own. And a star is born. Then an old man (Jeremy Irons) approaches Rory in Central Park and reveals his identity, and Rory’s eyes widen with alarm. Despite a compelling performance by Mr. Irons, this first feature film directed and written by Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal “is a clever, entertaining yarn that doesn’t bear close scrutiny,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times.

2013-11-26,What I Needed to Understand About Health Insurance,"I have bought health insurance for my workers since 1994, and since then I’ve spent well over a million dollars paying premiums. I have always found it to be troubling that I was given sole authority to make the choice as to what kind of coverage we would offer, and to a certain extent, how much it would cost. Was I doing a good job? I never heard any complaints about the policies I chose, even when I moved us into an HMO in the late ’90s, when I made my workers contribute to their plan costs in 2005, and when rates skyrocketed in the years after that.",Business Day,https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/what-i-needed-to-understand-about-health-insurance/

It was understandable, perhaps—the fog of disaster makes it hard to immediately know how much is “needed,” or what help is needed, even where.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/to-help-typhoon-survivors-go-local/

2013-11-26,Feeling For | A Parisian-Style Retreat in the Heart of Greenwich Village,"The Marlton House, built in 1900 and later a haven for Jack Kerouac and his crew, reopened this fall as the Marlton, a Parisian-inspired 107-room boutique hotel in the heart of Greenwich Village, just off Washington Square Park. It offers the same cool, casual elegance as the Bowery Hotel, a few blocks across town, but at a fraction of the price. The similarities to the Bowery are no surprise, as the Marlton is the work of the hotelier Sean MacPherson (also a developer of the Maritime and the Jane), who has once again created a hotel that feels as if it wasn’t designed just to sleep but also to sidle up to the bar in a dignified way and watch the P.Y.T.’s come and go. It’s the kind of place you could easily visit for afternoon tea with a parent on one of the plush sofas, or rendezvous with your lover for a martini followed by a trip to one of the small yet charming rooms, where the bed is the main attraction and finishing details are not overlooked. If you’re not in the mood for libations — and with creations like the Marvelous Sour (recipe below), the Marlton has taken steps to make sure that never happens — there is an espresso bar in the lobby that makes raw almond cappuccinos and gluten-free, vegan breakfast cookies. Coming soon will be a 98-seat restaurant in the rear of the lobby, Café Marlton, which will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. As a longtime neighbor of the building the Marlton now occupies, I can safely say it’s the best recent addition to the neighborhood where charm reigns supreme.

The next thing Mr. Hutto knew, he was rearing 16 chicks, becoming especially fond of Sweet Pea, a snuggler, and Turkey Boy, the bold rascal of the bunch. He wrote about the experience in his book “Illumination in the Flatwoods.” “An Original DUCKumentary,” at 9, follows wood ducks, among the most vividly colored of the more than 120 duck species, as they bond, migrate across thousands of miles, nurture a brood of ducklings — including prodding them out of their nest, 70 feet up an oak tree, for their first flight — and return to their wintering grounds.

Paul Lazar, who directs “Bodycast,” portrayed Ms. Bocanegra giving a lecture in Ms. Bocanegra’s “When a Priest Marries a Witch,” to which “Bodycast” is a quasi-sequel. In the new piece, which includes guest appearances by the singer Theo Bleckmann and the dancer Emily Coates, Ms. Bocanegra reflects (in the person of Ms. McDormand) on evolving ideals of female beauty, among other topics, as refracted through her experience of wearing a body cast for two years in her teens to correct her scoliosis.

Kennedy all entering the hereafter within a few hours of each other, portraying the resilience of the Kennedy mythos as, in part, a kind of secular/liberal rebellion against the same disenchanted utilitarian materialism that both Huxley and Lewis famously critiqued. This is a reason, I wrote, for even J.F.K. skeptics like myself to feel a little sympathy for the cult of Camelot — because it speaks to a deep and admirable human desire “for grace and beauty, for icons and heroes, for a high-stakes dimension to human affairs that a consumerist, materialist civilization can flatten and exclude.” The various things that J.F.K.’s admirers cite when they praise the man and his administration — the physical vigor and the soaring rhetoric, the patronage of high culture and the man-on-the-moon technological ambition, the Cuban Missile Crisis drama and the founding of the Peace Corps  — might not match up to a reality that was much more personally sleazy, culturally incurious and geopolitically reckless. But better a slightly bogus “vigah” than a society that deliberately cultivates what Lewis termed “men without chests.” Better a gap between self-sacrificial aspirations and grubbier realities than a society like Huxley’s “Brave New World” that excludes any dreams higher than comfort and consumption.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/the-perils-of-anti-decadence/

Despite a population of 1.2 million, the city has none of the stress-tinged, work-centric rhythms found in most European capitals, existing instead in a gentle post-Ottoman twilight, its leafy neighborhoods still full of small cafes, bars and taverns. The arrival of Starbucks hasn’t completely sidelined the local preference for Turkish coffee and the city’s old market — where kerchiefed farm wives sell their pickles in recycled jars and there is an abundant supply of the delicious cheese-filled phyllo pastries known as banitsa — is still busy, despite the big supermarkets opening on the outskirts of town.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/accommodations-in-bulgarias-charming-old-world-capital-a-modern-oasis/

The whitish-gray, mostly environmentally green building is the latest museum from Herzog & de Meuron, which designed the expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the De Young Museum in San Francisco. The three-story 120,000 square-foot building consists of a group of geometric volumes that seem almost to levitate between a base of several platforms and an immense perforated canopy overhead. In addition to reducing energy consumption, the canopy will support one of the museum’s most distinctive features: a hanging garden of native plants irrigated by collected rainwater. The effect is of an expanded Corbusier villa that has absorbed its greensward.

On his self-released debut album from last year, “Ice Cold Perm,” he raps with a smooth sneer over gooey tracks that recall the West Coast of the early-mid 1990s, a sound that’s been undervalued historically. And his new singles “Life of a Mack” (also heard in the video game “Grand Theft Auto V”) and “Keep a Bitch Broke” — in advance of a new EP, “IVRY” (Fool’s Gold) — show an admirable commitment to keeping that style alive. 100s is the most exciting artist on the “Turnt & Burnt” tour — along with the headliner, ASAP Ferg — which comes to Irving Plaza this week, and also features various other members of the ASAP Mob, as well as Joey Fatts, Aston Matthews and OverDoz.

Mr. Hagel issued the order — which also extended benefits to same-sex spouses of military service members — after the Supreme Court struck down a law this summer that had prevented federal recognition of same-sex marriages. At one point, nine states had objected to Mr. Hagel’s order, citing conflicts with state laws that do not recognize gay marriages. As a result, same-sex National Guard spouses in those states could sign up for benefits only by traveling to a federal military installation. As of Wednesday, only Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana were still defying Mr. Hagel’s order, said a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau in Washington.

As Mr. Mandela looks beyond the fury of the moment and calculates the cost of urging violence, you sense his frustration at having to make the only reasonable choice and taking the high road.

Freud was so well known that he was allowed into Clarke’s — a “small upmarket restaurant” frequented by Bryan Ferry, Salman Rushdie, Dame Maggie Smith, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge — before it opened in the morning, and invited to enjoy a leisurely meal in what functioned as his private salon. Over dinner at London’s more glittering establishments, he could pelt strangers with breadsticks, spew obscenities, pummel a waiter, grope the waitresses, amuse his companions by imitating a masturbating whale — and be welcomed back the next evening. At Clarke’s, “Lucian’s conversation ranged from dating Greta Garbo to the best way to land a punch without breaking your thumb, to how he had popped in to 10 Downing Street to see Gordon Brown, or had been to a nightclub with Kate Moss.” Oh, the life of an artist!",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/books/review/geordie-greigs-breakfast-with-lucian.html

At 5, he was banished from this paradise and sent back to the mother country to be raised by a placid English couple.

On-screen, this costume drama may have looked like a period piece, but behind the scenes, class tensions persisted. Upon arriving at the set, the actors playing the downstairs roles discovered they had been allotted inferior dressing rooms, with showers monopolized by the actors playing their masters.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/books/review/servants-by-lucy-lethbridge.html
2013-11-29,Kind Regards,"Once there were letters: handwritten, typewritten, carefully crafted, dashed off, profound or mundane, tinged with expectancy. Correspondence required waiting. “I need you more and more, and the great world grows wider, and dear ones fewer and fewer, every day that you stay away,” Emily Dickinson wrote to her future sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert, in 1852.

2013-11-29,Materfamilias,"Alison Weir’s new biography documents the life of the Tudors’ other Queen Elizabeth. Weir has already produced biographies of Elizabeth I, Henry VIII and Eleanor of Aquitaine, all better known than Elizabeth of York, whose obscurity belies the high profile of her connections. She came of age during the Wars of the Roses, the dynastic rivalry between the Houses of York and Lancaster. As the daughter of a Yorkist king, Edward IV, and the wife of the first Tudor (Lancastrian) king, Henry VII, she united these warring houses. For this alone, she deserves a prominent place in English history. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/books/review/elizabeth-of-york-by-alison-weir.html
2013-11-29,Murder at the Vicarage,"NO MAN’S NIGHTINGALE (Scribner, $26) is Ruth Rendell’s 24th Inspector Wexford procedural mystery in almost 50 years, so we’re naturally curious about how that venerable detective may have mellowed in retirement. Well, his mind is still sharp enough to solve a murder case bungled by Mike Burden, his old deputy and now detective superintendent of the Kingsmarkham constabulary. Always a tolerant man, Wexford is ever more alarmed by the racism and bigotry that have taken root in his little patch of England and were a factor in the murder of the Rev. Sarah Hussain, a biracial single mother raising an out-of-wedlock child. And, if anything, he’s grown more caustic about barbaric insults to the mother tongue, like the Alternative Service Book that replaced the Book of Common Prayer in Anglican churches.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/books/review/no-mans-nightingale-by-ruth-rendell-and-more.html

(HBO) BEAUTIFUL CREATURES (2013) Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich), an almost-too-good-to-be-true high school boy despairing of his conservative South Carolina existence, meets his dream girl, Lena (Alice Englert), when her family of witches moves to town, and “it’s kind of like Romeo and Juliet, but, like you know, happier,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this “pop Southern Gothic amusement about teenage love and other powerful magic.” Lena has some spooky relatives, including her Uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons) and cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum). Ethan comes with a nanny, Amma (Viola Davis, above left, with Ms. Englert and Mr. Ehrenreich). “ ‘Beautiful Creatures,’ its sweet young things and supernatural shenanigans have been marshaled to help fill the box office void left by the end of the ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Twilight’ franchises,” Ms. Dargis said of this adaptation of Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl’s book. “It’s a void that ‘The Hunger Games’ has already started to fill, partly by tapping into deeply American themes and giving them thrilling female form. ‘Beautiful Creatures’ has been spun from thinner material, despite its strong female characters, nods at the Civil War and a story that turns on good versus evil, a fight that — as in many young adult stories — is somewhat mirrored in the struggle between the high school herd and the individual. There’s not much new under the moon here, which makes what the writer and director Richard LaGravenese does with the story all the more notable.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html
