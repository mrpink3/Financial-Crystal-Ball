2004-04-01,Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Newark: F.B.I. Arrests 17 In Odometer Fraud,"A crime ring that bought cheap cars at auction, rolled back each of their odometers by thousands of miles and then sold the vehicles for far more than they were worth was dismantled after a 15-month investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials announced yesterday. Seventeen men were arrested. More than 1,000 used cars were bought and subsequent buyers were overcharged by more than $7.5 million, officials said.

2004-04-01,World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Economy Shrinks,"Canada's gross domestic product shrank 0.1 percent, adjusted for inflation, in January in contrast to a 0.5 percent gain in December, Statistics Canada said, raising the prospect that the Bank of Canada will cut its main interest rate for a third time this year. The bank's next monetary policy review is scheduled for April 13. The contraction in January resulted chiefly from weak vehicle sales, weak oil and gas output and a softening housing market. Analysts expect that first-quarter growth will be about 2 percent at an annualized rate, down from the 3.8 percent posted in the final three months of 2003.

From New Hampshire down to Georgia, across Texas to Arizona and up through California, you now have the booming exurban sprawls that have broken free of the gravitational pull of the cities and now float in a new space far beyond them. For example, the population of metropolitan Pittsburgh has declined by 8 percent since 1980, but as people spread out, the amount of developed land in the Pittsburgh area increased by nearly 43 percent.

The gross margin, a yardstick of profitability, widened from 41.6 percent in the fourth quarter, an Ericsson spokeswoman, Aase Lindskog, said. Ericsson had predicted earlier that the margin, which measures profit against expenses, would decline. It left unchanged a first-quarter forecast of sales rising 5 percent to 9 percent from a year earlier, without giving any revenue or net income figures. Ericsson, based in Stockholm, reported its first profit in almost three years in the fourth quarter.

The European Patent Office reversed a December decision that forced Boston Scientific to stop Dutch sales of the Express and Taxus brand stents. The latest ruling, which invalidated a patent belonging to Medinol Ltd. of Israel, is final and cannot be appealed, Boston Scientific said. The finding is a blow to Medinol, which said last year that it was trying to stop Boston Scientific from selling stents around the world. Boston Scientific marketed Medinol's Nir brand stents after the Israeli company, which is closely held, won approval to sell them in Europe in 1996 and the United States in 1998. The marketing agreement ended in 2001.

Last month the air-conditioner industry, which favored the 20 percent standard, announced that it would not pursue further court challenges. Matthew L.

2004-04-05,World Briefing | Asia: China: Tiananmen Relatives Freed,"Three women, members of a protest group called Tiananmen Mothers, were released from custody after domestic and international appeals for their freedom, family members said. The women, who had relatives who were killed in the crackdown on democracy protests in 1989, were taken from their homes on Sunday, possibly in connection with videotaped testimony they had made that rights advocates planned to present at a United Nations conference in Geneva. It is also possible the women were brought in for questioning as the police seek to prevent any protests connected with the 15th anniversary of the crackdown. As part of Tiananmen Mothers, the women -- Zhang Xianling, Ding Zilin and Huang Jinping -- have pressed Chinese leaders to reconsider the 1989 army crackdown and ''rehabilitate'' their dead relatives. Ms. Zhang and Ms. Ding both lost sons and Ms. Huang's husband was killed when army troops stormed Beijing on June 4, 1989, to crush a long-running but peaceful student-led demonstration.

2004-04-05,High Times,"''Get drunk!'' Charles Baudelaire exhorted in one of his best-known poems, but given what a mess he made of his own life, he's hardly the man to turn to for advice. A new biography, ''Baudelaire in Chains,'' insists that intoxication, far from being the wellspring of the poet's spirit, was ''the root of all his problems.'' And that's a lot of problems, observes the author, Frank Hilton, including Baudelaire's ''inability to manage his financial affairs, his unsatisfactory relationships, his bad health, his guignon'' -- the demonic misfortune he believed plagued him -- and, most important, his ''chronic difficulty in getting down to any prolonged creative work.'' All of this Hilton attributes to Baudelaire's opium addiction, which, he argues, other biographers have underestimated. Instead, they have blamed syphilis (a diagnosis that Hilton doubts) and other illnesses for his physical sufferings, the heartlessness of his intimates and the stupidity of the public for the rest.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/books/the-last-word-high-times.html

The Coalition for Public Health and Safety, concerned that a $92.4 million improvement plan for the airport actually means to expand it, argued that an independent air pollution study was needed for the airport. The coalition sued the Port Authority in 2002 to force the agency to pay for a study and to allow the coalition a voice in picking the company to conduct it. A Port Authority spokeswoman said the suit had no bearing on the tentative agreement, which stipulates that the Port Authority will pay $300,000 and the state $150,000 for an 18-month study with four monitoring stations on the airport perimeter.

2004-04-05,Rats," WHEN I WROTE the following account of my experiences with rats, I lived in an apartment building on a block filled with other apartment buildings, amidst the approximately eight million people in New York City, and I paid rent to a landlord that I never actually met-though I did meet the superintendent, who was a very nice guy. At this moment, I am living out of the city, away from the masses, in a bucolic little village with about the same number of inhabitants as my former city block. I wouldn't normally delve into my own personal matters, except that when I mention my rat experiences to people, they sometimes think I took extraordinary measures to investigate them, and I didn't. All I did was stand in an alley-a filth-slicked little alley that is about as old as the city and secret the way alleys are secret and yet just a block or two from Wall Street, from Broadway, and from what used to be the World Trade Center. All I did was take a spot next to the trash and wait and watch, rain or no rain, night after night, and always at night, the time when, generally speaking, humans go to sleep and rats come alive.

The nights were still chilly, too, which spells doom for these tropical plants native to Asia.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/nyregion/cuttings-getting-the-most-out-of-eggplants.html
2004-04-05,Detained While Young,"Stephen Elliott's HAPPY BABY (McSweeney's with MacAdam/Cage, $21) is surely the most intelligent and beautiful book ever written about juvenile detention centers, sadomasochism and drugs. Lesser writers might be tempted to milk such material for shock value, but one of Elliott's many gifts is his light touch. Nowhere in this, his fourth novel, does Elliott either overexplain or depict gratuitous brutality. Instead, in episodic chapters told in reverse chronological order, his guiding principles are precision and realism. Theo, the narrator, experienced sexual abuse, violence and occasional camaraderie during his adolescence as a ward of the state of Illinois (Elliot himself was also a ward of the state). As an adult, Theo feels most sexually and emotionally fulfilled when he is being insulted or punished. Seeking out, for example, a prostitute who ''makes'' him wear a diaper, Theo could appear freakish; but he is so fully drawn, and so honest about himself, that he seems touchingly normal. In deft, vivid scenes, other characters also come to life -- the dialogue is both natural-sounding and surprising -- and Theo's first girlfriend, Maria, is especially smart, complicated and, like Theo himself, matter-of-factly rather than self-pityingly unhappy. Though Theo sometimes longs for clarity or peace, both he and the book accept as a given that many people struggle almost all the time -- and that such struggling doesn't preclude moments of humor and comfort. The novel's backward structure means that rather than building momentum, it offers the sense of a mystery being slowly solved. That the mystery of why Theo, or anyone, turns out as he does is essentially unsolvable makes it no less satisfying, or, in Theo's case, less heartbreaking.

Gary Schroen had served for twenty-six years as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine services. He was now, in September 1996, chief of station in Islamabad, Pakistan. He spoke Persian and its cousin, Dari, one of Afghanistan's two main languages. In spy terminology, Schroen was an operator. He recruited and managed paid intelligence agents, conducted espionage operations, and supervised covert actions against foreign governments and terrorist groups. A few weeks before, with approval from CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, he had made contact through intermediaries with Ahmed Shah Massoud, the celebrated anti-Soviet guerrilla commander, now defense minister in a war-battered Afghan government crumbling from within.

2004-04-05,Soul Made Flesh," To imagine a time and place - say, the city of Oxford on a summer day in 1662 - you have to engage not only the mind's eye and ear but also the mind's nose. The warm odor of malt and corn flour rises from the boats landing at the wharves along the Thames. The stink of cured fish hanging in fishmongers' stalls mixes with the soft smell of bread in the bakeries. The smell of manure is everywhere, in the open sewers, on the town common where cows graze, in the streets where horses haul wagons and coaches. Sometimes a coach rolls through the narrow gate of one of Oxford's colleges, to be swallowed up behind a high, windowless stone wall. The chimneys of the college kitchens relay smoke signals to the surrounding neighborhoods, carrying the smell of roasting capon and mutton or perhaps a goose stolen from a nearby village by students.

The bodies were everywhere, strewn in fields and latrines and stacked in neat rows next to the road as if someone were keeping score. Countless times, Dallaire had to get out of his four-by-four and move remains from the middle of the road to avoid driving over them.

2004-04-05,Plain Heathen Mischief," After considering the possibilities for six days and six nights, it seemed pointless to mention sex or weakness or the girl, so Joel King decided his final sermon would be pale and simple, no more and no less than the ordinary things he'd said to his congregation in the past. There were, of course, several last-stand temptations he'd contemplated while staring at his laptop, and two he'd quixotically pecked to life even though he knew all along they'd never depart his study. The first composition was a blaze of fury, defiance and ""how-dare-you"" indignation. Jacked on coffee and Jonathan Edwards, he wasted an afternoon creating a fiery screed that would have him going out unbowed and bare-knuckled, every syllable a conflagration, every breath a test of will, the pulpit seething with brimstone and bit- ter jabs into the air. Then, on Friday morning, his wife called him a ""pissant,"" and by that evening, during a long, drab rain, a flamboyant collapse seemed—for an hour or so at least—like a good choice. Midway through this one, he started to use a Pentecostal tongue, typed the word ""Gawd"" a lot and didn't worry about periods, just strung together sentences he could preach big-time, throwing back his head and squeezing his eyes shut, the snot and tears running on his cheeks as he finished his career with a sopping, over-the-top, tent-revival mea culpa full of biblical caterwauling and pitifully rococo pleas to the forgiving heavenly Father.

2004-04-05,Searching Students For Contraband,"Re ''Seeking Security, Schools Are Turning to the Sniff Test'' [March 21]: I am appalled by the critical, even skeptical tone of the article, which gives equal time to the carping of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the most dangerous groups in America. The prevalent use of drugs at Melville High School in East Setauket is no secret, as attested by the disturbing images of Jimi Hendrix, doves, peace signs and multiracial groups of children holding hands that adorn its walls. In past, drug use among students has led to devil worship, sexual deviancy, Marxism and boys' lacrosse. I am glad we have a school administration that finally appreciates this problem, for there is no greater or more immediate threat to our youth than the war on drugs. The fact that the canine inspectors have not yet found any evidence of contraband does not mean that this is a sweetheart-deal boondoggle. It means that we must give the inspectors more time and all the resources they require. The school is better off than it was a year ago, and local residents are safer because teenage lawlessness is being fought in the schools and not in suburban streets. School officials will make sure that a problem that never existed does not get worse.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/nyregion/l-searching-students-for-contraband-074853.html

2004-04-05,RADIO: CHATTING ABOUT 'MORNING EDITION',"Discontented listeners opposed to replacing Bob Edwards as the host of NPR's popular news program ''Morning Edition'' can log onto the Internet today and say so. Jay Kernis, the network's senior vice president for programming, will hold a live, hourlong Web chat at NPR.org, beginning at 1 p.m. Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR's ombudsman, will be the host. Though Mr. Kernis, who was central in the decision to remove Mr. Edwards, has been responding to complaints through form letters and occasional phone calls, a spokeswoman for the network said it wanted to do more. ''We felt that we wanted to interact as directly as possible,'' said Jessamyn Sarmiento, NPR's director for public and media relations. ''It's not going to change the outcome of what has happened, but hopefully it will help paint the picture of why it happened in a clearer way.'' In addition to the Web chat, NPR has added a link on its Web site that synthesizes and provides answers to the flood of complaints -- more than 25,000 calls and e-mail messages, Ms. Sarmiento said -- that the network has received since announcing on March 23 that Mr. Edwards was being removed from his anchor post and reassigned as a senior correspondent. One of the most frequently asked questions was, ''Is there a chance you will change your mind and bring Bob back?'' The answer, delivered in wordy managerial speak: not likely. Mr. Edwards has negotiated and accepted a new contract and is scheduled to be host of ''Morning Edition'' for the last time on April 30.

An agreement could also help curtail the trade in counterfeits that has cost Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, about $121 million a year, Mr. Davies said.

2004-04-06,TV: 'SIMPSONS' SILENCE,"Production on the new season of ''The Simpsons,'' the enduring animated show on the Fox network, has been held up over contract demands by the actors who play major voice roles in the comedy series. People close to the negotiations said that the actors whose voices portray Marge, Homer, Bart, Lisa and other characters had not appeared for several table readings and had stalled production for the fall season. Those familiar with the negotiations said that the actors were seeking $360,000 an episode, or $8 million for a 22-episode season. Currently, top actors on the show earn about $125,000 an episode. Details of the impasse in contract talks were disclosed last week in Daily Variety. Executives at 20th Century Fox Television and James L. Brooks's Gracie Films, which produces the show, declined to comment. The actors involved include Dan Catellaneta, the voice of Homer; Julie Kavner (Marge); Hank Azaria (Moe, Apu and others); Harry Shearer (Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers and others), Yeardley Smith (Lisa) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart). The Simpsons began as a series of short vignettes on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' in 1987, and with its off-kilter, even subversive, humor, became an enormous success two years later as a regular series. It has also proven a gold mine for its creators.

Known as the Beverwyck site, near Parsippany and Troy Hills, it was a parking lot scheduled for expansion in the late 1990's when workers came across artifacts. Archaeologists eventually found slave shackles, buttons from Revolutionary War-era uniforms and other items that tied the site to a 2,000-acre mid-18th-century plantation known as Beverwyck. The Department of Environmental Protection plans to recommend the property for federal landmark status as well.

The faculty, alumni and staff of Columbia University Medical Center mourn the death of our former leader, Dr. Henrik Bendixen.

Dr. Bendixen joined the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia in 1973 as professor and chairman of anesthesiology after serving in posts at the Harvard Medical School and the University of California at San Diego. He was also director of the anesthesiology service at Presbyterian Hospital. He served as acting provost and vice president for the health sciences at Columbia in 1980-81. He was named Alumni Professor for the college in 1984 and the E.M. Papper Professor of Anesthesiology in 1985. He served as vice president and dean from 1984-89 and then became senior associate vice president and senior associate dean in 1989. During his time as vice president and dean he ushered the medical center's schools into the information age. He supported creation of a medical informatics center (now a P&S department) and established the computer infrastructure that has evolved into a ubiquitous educational, clinical, research, and administrative resource. In anesthesiology he was a leader in intensive care, developed new information on the care of patients with respiratory disease, and created the medical center's first department-wide practice plan. When he was named professor emeritus of anesthesiology in 1994, a portrait was unveiled in the medical center library, where it hangs today to honor his contributions to information technology in education, clinical systems, and administration.

The man, Steven Murphy, 21, of East Massapequa, was accused of fatally striking the 9-month-old baby, who was crying, while baby-sitting in 2002. Last September, he pleaded guilty to a manslaughter charge. Mr. Murphy maintained that he had struck the infant once in the stomach. But Robert Biancavilla, the deputy chief of the district attorney's major offense bureau, said there had been repeated blows. An autopsy revealed that the child's liver was severed and his intestines lacerated. Mr. Murphy worked nights and watched his son days while the child's mother worked, Mr. Biancavilla said.

2004-04-08,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HALPERN, NATHAN L.","HALPERN--Nathan L. died April 3 at home. A man of strong, agile intellect, life long excellence, high achievement and significant contributions to the quality of life in New York City. He was independent, original and a true American success story. Through his company, Theatre Network Television, he was the USA pioneer and successful business developer of three major areas of television--the multi-city live interactive video conference; the use of large screen TV image magnification for audiences at meetings of all types and special events; and large screen TV presentations of live sports, with replays in major arenas. A tireless, effective Trustee for the Central Park Conservancy, he was proud of being part of and seeing the renaissance of Central Park; as recognition of his efforts, he was made a Life Trustee. He was a benefactor and member of the corporation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was president of the International Center of Photography during an important period of its development; and because of the results, he was made an Honorary Trustee. Born in Sioux City, Iowa to Aaron and Lena Halpern, who had emigrated from Russia, his family finally settled in Los Angeles. Graduating from Theodore Roosevelt High School, he was a top student as well as the basketball scoring leader for the City of Los Angeles. Receiving a scholarship to University of Southern California, he graduated in 1936 with Phi Beta Kappa honors, as well as being a member of three Pacific Conference champion basketball teams. He then came east to Harvard Law School where he was a member and Treasurer of the Law Review. To help with the publication's finances, he developed the idea of publishing volumes of previous years' editions and selling them to interested professionals--a successful venture. Upon graduation, he went as a young lawyer to Washington, D.C. as Assistant to the Chairman of the SEC. While working with the SEC he was given an additional duty to assist in the drafting of the Lend Lease. Then served as Executive Assistant to the Director of WPB 1941-42. During WWII as a Navy Officer, he became Executive Assistant to James Forrestal. Seeking an active role overseas, he became part of the Office of Strategic Services. He participated in the planning of D-Day in London. Executive Assistant to Director of US Information Services (France), he went behind German lines in Belgium and later had duties that brought him all the way through and behind the lines of the advancing Russian troops to start negotiating repatriation of whole populations in Europe. In the course of his OSS assignments, he met William S. Paley, President of CBS and some of the people who worked for him. After the war, he went to work for CBS from 1945-49, becoming Assistant to Mr. Paley during the period. As he learned more about the new medium of television. he developed an innovative concept of closed circuit television--the ''special origination, distribution and display of television to a special audience.'' He left CBS to form his own company. His work over the next 45 years included the first pay-TV events televised live to theatre audiences; the first satellite television telecasts to Europe (Telstar), Japan and China; ten national political conventions in which he was part of changing the entire nature of the televised event through new staging of the rostrum, preparing speakers for TV and special TV presentations for the audience; providing new national private network TV marketing communication for major US companies; designing and providing the high resolution large screen TV technology which NASA used for management of its rocket launches as well as extensive application for all the images from the moon during Apollo 11; breakthrough medical television techniques with live broadcasts from hospitals into major medical meetings involving patient case histories, treatment techniques and live surgeries; many of the biggest sports events and concerts; major meetings of associations, religious denominations, corporations; flight simulator displays and air traffic control. He loved East Hampton and the beach. He became a founding member and president of the East Hampton Beach Preservation Society and, true to form, became an expert as he researched the facts on beaches and erosion/ build up patterns. He was an avid landscaper and tree planter and created a beautiful environment at his home. A voracious reader, a fine eye and appreciation for art and a collector in various categories, a punster, he swam in the ocean and shot baskets regularly until age 85. He is predeceased by Edith, his loving wife of 63 years. He is survived by his son Michael, daughter-in-law Chris Grant and two grandsons. Funeral arrangements were private.

Mr. Papadopoulos, left, said the plan would threaten the security of citizens by disbanding the Greek Cypriot army. Earlier, Mr. Denktash said he would campaign for a ""no"" vote in the northern Turkish third of the island, a breakaway state recognized internationally only by Turkey and occupied by 40,000 Turkish troops. He made it clear that he believed the plan would spell an end to that state. Under the plan, Cyprus would become a loose federation. If voters on either side reject the referendums, only the Greek Cypriot south will be represented in the European Union. Polls have pointed to a rejection by Greek Cypriots and approval by Turkish Cypriots by a thin majority.

The boys, the eldest of who was ten, died shortly after they had been taken to the London Skin Hospital for treatment for ringworm. On their arrival at the hospital, the examining physician prescribed the rare drug thallium acetate, and he made his prescription out according to the metric system of weights. Consequently, it was necessary for the hospital pharmacist to convert the metric numbers to the apothecary system, not using metric weights but scales. In doing so she misplaced the decimal point, thus increasing the dose tenfold. Administration of the medicine had almost immediate fatal results, death occurring before the attendants realized or could determine the cause.

Storm water runoff is the largest source of coastal water pollution, and highways serve to collect and channel pollutants, including toxic particles from tires, oil and grease.

The man, Brian W. Beard, was sitting in his car outside a Norwich pizzeria in April 2002 when two plainclothes police officers, along with five officers in uniform, approached and asked him if he had any weapons or drugs, according to court records. Mr. Beard told them he did not, and while his car was being searched, he was asked to pull down his underwear and submit to a full body search, court records said. After the search, his belongings were returned to him and he was allowed to leave the scene, according to the records. Lt. John John of the Norwich police said yesterday, ''This is the first I've heard of it.''

2004-04-12,"1904:Pneumonia Takes Toll : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO"," NEW YORK: The appalling fatality of pneumonia during the last few months has been the subject of universal comment. In New York alone there have been over six thousand deaths since December 1. Statistics show also that the prevalence of the disease and the ratio of mortality are increasing from year to year in spite of improved sanitation and increasing attention to civic hygiene. This is in marked contrast with the conditions governing the spread of tuberculosis, inasmuch as that disease always flourishes in uncleanly and ill-ventilated quarters. There has been no end of theorizing as to the real causes of epidemic ""lung fever,"" but as yet no definite solution of the problem has been reached. It is so fashionably scientific to match every disease with its microbe that it is no wonder we hear more of the pneumococcus than we ever did before.

Fittingly, Terrie Sultan, the director of the Blaffer Gallery, the art museum of the University of Houston, goes much deeper than the usual artist appreciation in CHUCK CLOSE PRINTS: Process and Collaboration (Princeton University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $35). After Sultan's introduction and an essay by Richard Shiff, an art professor at the University of Texas, Austin, whole chapters are devoted to each type of printmaking that Close has mastered. He is interviewed by his longtime collaborators about techniques both familiar (silk-screen) and less so (spitbite etching). Close has called himself ''an artist looking for trouble'' because, as Sultan writes, ''extricating himself from a technical corner becomes a catalyst for his creativity.'' Close is never sure how he will achieve the desired result; part of his talent lies in being up for anything. ''I have this naïve belief in systems,'' he has said, ''that if you believe in something and follow it, you will create something.''

The double-decker buses, with their open tops in the spring, where romantic tourists ate their picnic lunches, were scrapped. The old Lafayette restaurant in Greenwich Village was demolished. Schrafft's, with its Irish waitresses in their black dresses, white aprons and lace tiaras, with its date-nut bread, creamed chicken with bright green peas and pineapple sundaes, was dying as if in sympathy with the afflicted cityscape itself. A developer seriously proposed tearing down Carnegie Hall and replacing it with a vertical crate the color of tomato soup. He was thwarted. But another developer got away with wrecking the glorious Pennsylvania Station and erecting in its place a grimy glass and concrete box, the mortal twitch of a dying modernism. Sprouting along Sixth and Third and Lexington, these morbid boxes were like the detritus of an intergalactic invasion.

2004-04-12,'The Fabric of the Cosmos'," None of the books in my father's dusty old bookcase were forbidden. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone take one down. Most were massive tomes-a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of western literature, numerous others I can no longer recall-that seemed almost fused to shelves that bowed slightly from decades of steadfast support. But way up on the highest shelf was a thin little text that, every now and then, would catch my eye because it seemed so out of place, like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, I'm not quite sure why I waited so long before taking a look. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like material you read and more like family heirlooms you admire from afar. Ultimately, such reverence gave way to teenage brashness. I reached up for the little text, dusted it off, and opened to page one. The first few lines were, to say the least, startling.

A 90-year-old federation of the state's local boards, the association has criticized Governor McGreevey for saying in his state of the state address that he planned to eliminate nonoperating districts because ''they oversee nothing but their own existence.'' Each such district has a part-time administrator who handles tuition and transportation bills and makes $10,000 to $15,000 a year. The Department of Education plan would dissolve the districts and transfer their duties to their respective municipal governments at an estimated savings of $750,000 statewide. But representatives of the 23 districts, at a meeting April 3, argued that municipalities have no experience in school education and finance matters.

2004-04-12,The Silent President,"President Bush was asked, during a very brief session with reporters yesterday, about the now-famous Aug. 6, 2001, memo he received on domestic terrorism. He responded with the familiar White House complaint about lack of specificity in the C.I.A.'s warnings -- although the memo mentioned a plot, possibly involving hijacked planes and New York City. The most striking thing about the president's comment, however, was his bottom line: that he did everything he could. Over the last few weeks we have heard lawmakers and officials from two administrations talk about their feelings of responsibility, about how they compulsively re-examine the events leading up to 9/ll, asking themselves whether they could have done anything to avert the terrible disaster that day. It is beginning to seem that the only person free of that kind of self-examination is the man who was chief executive when the attacks occurred.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/12/opinion/the-silent-president.html

Quovadx, based in Englewood, Colo., said that it had hired the law firm of Hogan & Hartson to review the company's relationship with Infotech.

2004-04-14,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Mayor Orders Approval Of Contract,"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has ordered the city comptroller to clear a marketing contract with Snapple that the comptroller has argued was awarded improperly. In a letter sent late Monday, the mayor invoked a City Charter provision requiring the comptroller to register the contract within 10 days. The contract gives Snapple exclusive rights to market its soft drinks and snacks on municipal property throughout New York. In the mayor's letter to the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., above, the mayor said he had found no evidence to support Mr. Thompson's concerns that the city could have made more money if other suppliers had been given a fair chance to compete for the deal. Mr. Thompson said in a statement yesterday that he remained troubled by the contract and was ''investigating legal options to ensure that the city gets the best deal.''

Mony, based in New York, said 15.5 percent of investors had indicated they would prefer that a judge determine the value of their shares rather than receive the $31 offered by AXA, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The amount of dissenters exceeds a 15 percent trigger that allows AXA to cancel the purchase.

Microsoft had sued, claiming the Lindows.com name confused consumers and diluted the trademark for Windows, the operating system that runs about 95 percent of the world's personal computers. The federal judge in the case had questioned the validity of Windows as a trademark. Customers will not be affected and the change will not require an upgrade, Lindows said. The company's Web site will be renamed www.linspire.com. Lindows will be kept as the corporate name and used in ''certain instances'' in the United States, said a Lindows spokeswoman, Kira Lee.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/15/business/technology-briefing-software-lindows-renames-its-software-overseas.html

2004-04-15,"Paid Notice: Deaths   MORAN, CHARLES F.","MORAN--Charles F., retired business leader and civic benefactor, passed away at his home in Wheaton on Monday (April 12, 2004). He retired in 1993 as Senior Vice President and as a member of the Sears Roebuck and Co. Management Committee after a forty year career with Sears. Most recently he was Chairman of the Board of Denny's Corporation, and President of the Homan Arthington Foundation, which was responsible for redeveloping the original Sears headquarters location on Chicago's West Side into affordable housing for threehundred families in the North Lawndale neighborhood. Mr. Moran was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1930, and developed a lifelong love for sports and humor. He starred as a catcher at Drew University in Madison, NJ, played in the Northern League on a team affiliated with the New York Yankees, and earned positions with numerous traveling All-Star baseball teams. He caught batting practice for the Brooklyn Dodgers on several occasions, including for the 1949 Major League All-Star Game held at Ebbets Field. One All-Star team appearance in 1948 led him to Mauch Chunk, PA (now Jim Thorpe, PA), where he met his wife of fifty-two years, Dolores Huber. After a short Army stint, Mr. Moran joined Sears as a trainee in its Hackensack, NJ store. In forty years and seven moves he took on increasing responsibility, ranging from spilling paint as a trainee to selling the Sears Tower, from plowing Sears parking lots to building new parking lots, and from integrating Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker into Sears to then subsequently leading the divestiture of these units. Sears retired Chairman, President and CEO Edward Brennan said ''Charley was a man of great competence and total integrity. Whenever there was a tough challenge, he could be counted on to handle it successfully.'' Mr. Moran also acted as Chairman of Thermadyne Holdings Corporation, and Prodigy Services (a joint venture between Sears and IBM that was a key precursor to the Internet). He acted on numerous corporate boards, including Discover Bank and the Morgan Stanley Trust Company, SPS Transaction Services, Inc., Advantis, Inc., DeSoto, Inc., and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. His other civic contributions included membership in the Sorin Society at the University of Notre Dame, and as a benefactor to many needy students. He leaves a loving family, and numerous friends and colleagues who will miss him for his many contributions. His ongoing legacy is his family--wife, Dolores; daughter, Mary (William) Deatherage; son, Charles (Dianne) Moran; daughter, Alice Moran; son, John (Laura) Moran; and eleven grandchildren.

2004-04-15,"Interior Design, No Appointment Necessary","Kevin Mancini and Payam Yazdani stumbled into the Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis architectural office while searching the hip Lower East Side for a place to open their new coffee shop, Ini Ani. ''They became our first walk-in clients,'' said Paul Lewis (far left, with his partners Marc Tsurumaki, center, and David J. Lewis, his twin brother). Challenged by a bare-bones budget of $35,000, the architects did much of the fabrication themselves. They used inexpensive construction materials like corrugated cardboard to create a screen (above) that wraps around the cafe's sitting area, delineating circulation from seating and providing acoustical dampening. Custom oak and stainless steel chairs (above left) mirror the profile of a built-in wraparound bench. The cardboard wall system's steel supports are echoed in hanging steel light fixtures. There is a decorative plaster relief (top left) of 479 individually cast coffee cup lids, gathered from the neighborhood. Paul Lewis said, ''I love the idea that these functional elements could be very repetitive, yet have incredible variation as well.'' Ini Ani serves coffee, tea, and multiethnic snacks including a Persian breakfast of feta, figs, dates, tomatoes and cucumbers. It is at 105 Stanton Street (Ludlow Street); (212) 254-9066.

Mud-spattered pickup trucks park alongside luxury cars, roosters crow throughout the day, and four draft horses live a half block from the town square. The area's Spanish and Mexican heritage is evident in the central plaza, which is surrounded by a historic mission, whitewashed adobe buildings and the fortress barracks of Gen. Mariano Vallejo, the Mexican commander who established Sonoma in 1835. The Sonoma Valley's ideal climate and rich rocky soil also turn out an endless cornucopia of grapes and excellent produce, and award-winning local chefs use the fresh bounty to their advantage.

Max's article (March 28) might lead readers to believe that there was a ''group'' or ''cluster'' of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases in Washington State recently. That is inaccurate or, at the very least, misleading. It is true that we have had 35 possible cases over a six-year period, but they have not been grouped or clustered in any way. In this time period, that would be a typical number of cases for any area in the country with the same population. Additionally, we track C.J.D. when it is mentioned on death certificates. In these 35, C.J.D. was often just one of several possible causes of death mentioned. Of the 35, only 14 people had autopsies, so there is no way for us to confirm the true causes of death for the other 21. We are working to encourage more autopsies in suspected C.J.D. cases so we can have a better understanding of this disease.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/magazine/l-the-case-of-the-cherry-hill-cluster-181943.html

2004-04-19,Harried Child,"IN the fall of 2000, the New York independent filmmaker Michael Almereyda took a small crew to San Francisco to record the gestation of a Sam Shepard play. The stars were Sean Penn and Nick Nolte, as brothers uneasily reunited in the grungy desert shack of their recently deceased but still very present father (the longtime Shepard interpreter James Gammon). Woody Harrelson, Cheech Marin and Sheila Tousey had supporting roles. Mr. Shepard, who had played the ghost in Mr. Almereyda's 2000 film of ''Hamlet'' with Ethan Hawke, was directing. ''This So-Called Disaster: Sam Shepard Directs 'The Late Henry Moss' '' is distilled from Mr. Almereyda's 140 hours of videotape. It examines not just artists burrowing their way into Mr. Shepard's text, but also a writer grappling with the legacy of his ornery, alcoholic father. (''This so-called disaster'' is how Mr. Shepard's father once described their family life.) Last month Mr. Almereyda talked with Sylviane Gold about his film, which opens at Film Forum in Manhattan on Wednesday.

Of Ray Kappe, the architecture critic Michael Webb writes in ''Themes and Variations: House Design by Ray Kappe,'' ''This undogmatic but committed modern architect has created a succession of houses that are a comfortable fit for their sites and the needs of their owners.'' In fact, Kappe has designed more than 100 houses since the 1950's, and energy conservation was in the forefront of his consciousness long before California building codes mandated such measures in 1975. Kappe also became known for his sensitive and resourceful solutions to building on steep sites -- a skill he honed with the design of his own house. The house that Kappe designed for Anne Keeler and Gordon Melcher in Pacific Palisades (a) was completed in 1990. It is a taller, narrower version of the concrete-tower-and-laminated-beam structure that Kappe had built for himself decades earlier. A skylit staircase and gallery cut through the main space (b), connecting the living areas to the bedrooms below.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/magazine/footnotes-084930.html

2004-04-19,The Ocean in the Head,"When Marvin Bell, in his excellent new collection of poems, writes the totally characteristic line ''His spine quivers like a long quill, quite like it,'' it's worth considering what that ''quite like it'' might be doing there. Verbally and rhythmically it functions as a sort of heart murmur, a shrug or flutter after the main pulse of the line. This is Bell's territory in miniature: echo, aftermath, a looking backward through the veil of things. RAMPANT (Copper Canyon, $20) deals in negative space: ''A lit cigarette is building an ash column,'' Bell writes in ''Of a Student''; Gaudí's great church in Barcelona ''remains unfinished but / people talk about it''; a wartime experience is so intense it becomes ''a glare, a deficit in memory.'' We are assured in ''The Troubling'' that ''there is an outside beyond the farthest / thing we can imagine.'' As a poet in the office of student or historian of consciousness, Bell performs beautifully, like a less sleek Wallace Stevens. One of this book's highlights is called ''Ulysses, Too, Was Sometimes Down at Heart,'' in which the hero's sea wanderings are shrunk to the size of an anxious 21st-century brain, and oceanic storms contract to a chemical flux in the skull -- the mood swing, the change of the wind, the swing of the boom beneath the sail. ''We have learned to / hear the sound of a rain cloud forming. A mast / nearly snaps. We make that promise again -/ to be steadier, to spend the highs slowly.'' This is sympathy, the real thing.

2004-04-19,Page Two: April 11-17; Pumping Up,"Just as the economy finally seems to be gaining momentum, Wall Street has a new worry: inflation. After three years of low interest rates and huge federal budget deficits, corporate profits are rising strongly and jobless claims are falling. But on Wednesday, the government reported that prices paid by consumers rose 0.5 percent in March. Excluding energy and food costs, which are very volatile, prices rose 0.4 percent, double the average forecast. The index has risen that much only four times in the last decade. Now many investors believe that the Federal Reserve may have to begin raising short-term interest rates as early as June, cooling the recovery before it has fully taken hold.

''I've always adored that piece,'' Slesin says. ''It's an idea that always makes me smile and embodies everything that appeals to me about design -- it's quirky, folksy, partly recycled, thought-provoking and not pretentious.'' Although the piece is one of a series officially called You Can't Lay Down Your Memories, the group could also be referred to as You Can't Remember Where You Put Anything. ''I love that you have to go fish for your socks because you have no idea where you put them,'' she says. ''For me, it's part of its appeal, and besides, it trains your memory.''

2004-04-19,We the Characters,"Writers have set some perversely difficult tasks for themselves: composing a novel entirely devoid of the letter ''E,'' for example, or a novel in which the chapters can be read in a number of different orders. One of the trickiest feats is to narrate a story in the first-person plural. It's so hard, in fact, that among the dispiritingly vast array of titles shelved in my local bookstore's How to Write Fiction section, few even mention the first-person plural as an option. John Gardner's classic, ''The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,'' refers to it in passing as ''the 'town' point of view, in which the voice in the story is some unnamed spokesman for all the community,'' and notes that William Faulkner's short story ''A Rose for Emily'' is the best-known example. But even in the sentence or two he devotes to the subject, Gardner assumes too much. Is the ''we'' who narrates Faulkner's Gothic tale about a reclusive spinster really ''some unnamed spokesman'' or is it the town itself?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/books/the-last-word-we-the-characters.html

He was steeling himself for a confrontation with his boss, screwing up his nerve to ask for a raise, but his present circumstances were conspiring against him. His fourteen-year-old Dodge Colt rattled in place in the middle of the Travis Street Bridge, hemmed in on all sides by bulbous, purring pickup trucks and gleaming sport utility vehicles with fat, black tires. The electric blues and greens of these enormous automobiles reflected the dazzling morning glare through Paul's cracked and dirty windshield; they radiated shimmering heat through his open window. Waiting for the light, the fingers of his left hand drumming the scalding side of his car, the skin of his forearm baking to leather in the heat, Paul felt less like a man who deserved more out of life than a peasant on a mule cart trapped in the middle of an armored division.

We had been covered in a group plan thanks to Matt's fellowship at Occidental College, a post he held while at work on a book. But the two of us were increasingly structuring our work lives as entrepreneurs. Jody worked part time in venture capital, served as lead director of a public company and was thinking of launching her own business; Matt had added consulting to column and book writing and his weekly radio show. The agent we had spoken with had recommended getting into the individual market for health insurance while we were in our early 40's and healthy. That way, he said, we could pursue such freelance lives with the assurance that we would always have health coverage. Once you are in the system, he said, you will only be subject to the annual premium increases the insurers apply to everyone. But trying to move from group coverage into the individual market when we were older might be much harder. If you think you are headed in an entrepreneurial direction, he concluded, it's best to make the shift as soon as you can.

That will increase the 2002 net loss by about $10 million and reduce 2003 net income by about $14 million. TDS, which is based in Chicago, said that sales would not change. After a review, the company increased the value of the wireless licenses by $230 million, TDS said. Goodwill -- an intangible asset that is the difference between the price paid for an asset and its book value -- decreased by $139 million, and related deferred income taxes rose by $91 million. Increasing the value of the wireless licenses makes them subject to larger write-downs when the market value of the asset is less than the book value, a TDS spokesman, Mark Steinkrauss, said. TDS's net income fell in 2003 and its loss increased in 2002 because the company had to write down the value of some wireless licenses, he said. TDS had reported 2003 net income of $61.1 million and a 2002 loss of $984.8 million.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/20/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-tds-to-restate-some-results.html

Foodservice, one of the largest food distributors in the United States, reported a $218 million operating loss last year. It recorded a $148 million profit in 2002. Ahold executives attributed the Foodservice loss in part on difficulties with suppliers after the accounting scandal. Several of Ahold's supermarket chains in the United States, including Giant-Landover, reported significant declines in operating income because of a weak dollar and retail margin pressures. Ahold's total 2003 sales were down 10.6 percent, to 56.1 billion euros ($67.4 billion).

He joined CSFB in November, 2000, when the firm merged with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he was a Managing Director, Founder and CoHead of the Private Fund Group.

Congress voted in 2002 to allow up to $8 billion in Liberty Bonds to provide tax-free financing to help New York City rebuild after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The lead plaintiff in the suit, Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, said that the plant was not in Lower Manhattan and did not fit the definition of nonresidential real property required by the federal statute, and that local residents were opposed to another plant in the area. Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, who is a defendant in the lawsuit, said the project met the criteria for the program because it allowed up to $2 billion in bonds to be used outside Lower Manhattan for projects benefiting the entire city. She called the lawsuit ''frivolous'' and said that when completed, the plant would provide up to 10 percent of the city's energy.

The five appeals judges, whose decision is final, settled a question much debated by legal scholars: was the persecution and killing of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs and others, known as ethnic cleansing. a deliberate genocidal campaign? Referring to the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995, the court said the crime ''should be called by its proper name: genocide.'' The ruling came in an appeal by Radislav Krstic, above, a Bosnian Serb general and the only person yet convicted of genocide in the former Yugoslavia. The judges reduced his sentence to 35 years from 46 because he had ''aided and abetted genocide'' in Srebrenica but had not taken part in it. Legal scholars said the ruling on genocide, the most serious of war crimes, was likely to have an important effect on the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president, and on other cases.

2004-04-21,THE VIRTUAL ORCHESTRA (CONTINUED),"The Opera Company of Brooklyn has formally withdrawn from a recent agreement with the Broadway musicians union that would have prevented the opera from using a so-called virtual orchestra machine, a sophisticated synthesizer that closely approximates the sound of real musicians. Jay D. Meetze, the company's founder and principal conductor, said in a statement that he objected to efforts by the union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, to dictate which instruments he could use. ''The union has gone too far by trying to take away my choices for artistic expression,'' Mr. Meetze said. In response, David Lennon, the president of Local 802, said his union had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board against the opera company.

Others will be directed to livery cabs and ambulette services, and will be reimbursed. The striking drivers are members of Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union.

The show, broadcast on Sundays at 9 p.m. on ABC, is the soap opera of spy series, tangling international espionage with tortured familial relationships. Sydney Bristow, for example, the C.I.A. agent played by the show's star, Jennifer Garner, began the third season by waking up two years after the second season ended. She had been presumed dead, she learned, and had no memory of how she had spent the lost time. Sydney spent many of the ensuing episodes caught in a love triangle with her ex-boyfriend (a fellow spy named Michael Vaughn) and the woman he married while Bristow was gone. Her emotionally distant father (Victor Garber) is a colleague, her mother is a threat to national security, and she may or may not be the subject of a doomsday prophecy by a 16th-century sage named Milo Rambaldi.

He also has a well-earned reputation for being a total pill. The principal reason he was booed, though, is that many people suspect that he cheated. They believe that his eye-popping home-run totals of the past few years were ''artificially encouraged,'' as Hemingway once said of doped-up racehorses. Despite his denials, they assume he is now surpassing the sport's most hallowed names in the record books on something other than his own merits.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-4-25-04-essay-can-drug-free-baseball-stars-smash-records.html

2004-04-26,'The Shadow of the Wind'," Asecret's worth depends on the people from whom it must be kept. My first thought on waking was to tell my best friend about the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Tomás Aguilar was a classmate who devoted his free time and his talent to the invention of wonderfully ingenious contraptions of dubious practicality, like the aerostatic dart or the dynamo spinning top. I pictured us both, equipped with flashlights and compasses, uncovering the mysteries of those bibliographic catacombs. Who better than Tomás to share my secret? Then, remembering my promise, I decided that circumstances advised me to adopt what in detective novels is termed a different modus operandi. At noon I approached my father to quiz him about the book and about Julián Carax-both world famous, I assumed. My plan was to get my hands on his complete works and read them all by the end of the week. To my surprise, I discovered that my father, a natural-born librarian and a walking lexicon of publishers' catalogs and oddities, had never heard of The Shadow of the Wind or Julián Carax. Intrigued, he examined the printing history on the back of the title page for clues. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/books/chapters/the-shadow-of-the-wind.html

2004-04-26,DISTRICT BUDGETS,"Voters last week approved almost 70 percent of 550 school budgets, an increase over last year's 62 percent approval rate, according to the New Jersey School Boards Association. The budgets under consideration totaled more than $9.5 billion. The results were seen as an indication that residents by and large supported increases as state aid remains stagnant. ''I think voters understood the situation boards were in,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the association. ''They have had inadequate state aid and rising costs not in their control.'' Voters supported increases in 39 of the 75 districts where the increases exceeded the state-imposed cap of more than 3 percent. Last year, one-third of those increases were approved. The election was by no means a rubber stamp. In one closely contested district, Fairfield, Essex County, the vote was tied 201 to 201 and is considered a defeat; the budget must now be decided by the town council. In Moorestown, Burlington County, in another close vote, the budget was defeated 1,056 to 1,037.

2004-04-26,The New Queen of Mean,"WITH her curves subdued by a dark blazer and her lovely face obscured by comp-lit glasses, Tina Fey may be America's most powerful antidote to the Barbie Doll. She's the first female co-anchor of ''Weekend Update'' on ''Saturday Night Live'' since Jane Curtin, who worked with Dan Aykroyd back in the 70's, and she's the first female head writer in the show's 29-year history. Two years ago, after reading Rosalind Wiseman's ''Queen Bees and Wannabes,'' a pop-ethnography that details the unfathomably cruel folkways of adolescent girls, Ms. Fey decided it was the perfect raw material for her first screenplay. The comedy, opening on Friday nationwide, is ''Mean Girls,'' a 97-minute orgy of wish fulfillment about a lonesome newcomer (Lindsay Lohan) who embeds herself in the popular crowd. On a recent spring afternoon, the writer Jennifer Senior had coffee with Ms. Fey, who also has a small role in the movie, to discuss screenwriting, news gathering and the mythological role of hot dogs in girl-world byzantium.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/movies/film-the-new-queen-of-mean.html

There is a breathtaking series of photographs of two cats jumping together (almost gleefully, it appears) from ledge to ledge.

The news was surprising and not a little deflating. The mutation that lifted us above the other apes had nothing directly to do with our brain. Rather, it had to do with our jaw. What led to the emergence of modern humans, in all of our culture-creating, science-discovering, globe-dominating glory, was a chance defect in a gene responsible for the formation of our jaw muscles. So, at least, the scientists speculated.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-4-25-04-swelled-heads.html

After balking at the idea for months, Mr. McGreevey indicated that he would be willing to call a joint legislative session to propose the tax increase, provided that the proceeds go to property tax relief. The plan would raise the levy on households with a taxable income of more than $500,000 to about 9 percent from the current rate of 6.37 percent, legislative and administrative officials said. The $700 million raised by such an increase would pay for homestead rebates, which offer refunds to homeowners 65 and older, and would restore rebates to middle-income households.

2004-04-26,'The President of Good and Evil'," George W. Bush is not only America's president, but also its most prominent moralist. No other president in living memory has spoken so often about good and evil, right and wrong. His inaugural address was a call to build ""a single nation of justice and opportunity."" A year later, he famously proclaimed North Korea, Iran and Iraq to be an ""axis of evil,"" and in contrast, he called the United States ""a moral nation."" He defends his tax policy in moral terms, saying that it is fair, and gives back to taxpayers what is rightfully theirs. The case he makes for free trade is ""not just monetary, but moral."" Open trade is a ""moral imperative."" Another ""moral imperative,"" he says, is alleviating hunger and poverty throughout the world. He has said that ""America's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards."" In setting out the ""Bush doctrine,"" which defends preemptive strikes against those who might threaten America with weapons of mass destruction, he asserted: ""Moral truth is the same in every culture, in every time, and in every place."" But in what moral truths does the president believe? Considering how much the president says about ethics, it is surprising how little serious discussion there has been of the moral philosophy of George W. Bush.

E-Cornell had a good course, but turned out not to be offering it when I wanted to start. Cardean won out over Phoenix because it was willing to provide information on the instructors; the norm is to tell you about the professor who planned the course, not the professor who is actually teaching it.

Mr. Maddin, a Canadian, has an affinity for the early German Expressionist films of Fritz Lang, as well as the nightmarish surreality of David Lynch. '' 'Eraserhead' gave me the courage to make movies,'' he once said. '' 'Wow,' I thought, when I saw it. 'This is my biography. How did someone read my mind and project it onto the screen?' '' Mr. Maddin's new film, ''The Saddest Music in the World,'' is filled with imagery that seems projected directly from his psyche. Set in Winnipeg, Manitoba, during the Depression, this stark fantasia is about a ruthless beer baroness (Isabella Rossellini), who in an effort to encourage alcohol consumption, sponsors a global contest to find the most mournful music possible.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/movies/film-the-essence-of-the-dust-bowl-at-40-below.html

Loving father of Paul, Jane, Robin and John (Hinchcliff). Doting grandfather of Kate, Abby, and Emily. Graduate CCNY; MA, NYU. Worked at PM newspaper with his good friend George Nelson. Served in the Army Air Corps in WWII. A lifelong ad man and marketing consultant, early on Mill worked for the American Jewish Committee and did publicity for Nathan's of Coney Island. He worked with James Beard and other notables in the food world. In the 1950's, Mill became a partner in The Lampert Agency. He had a long association with Strathmore Paper, and later in life was VP of Marketing at Impressions of Roslyn. He was a regular contributor to ''Communication Arts.'' Mill was a fine writer --precise, elegant language was his to command. He was an accomplished sculptor, working in various media. He loved music & art, across a heroically eclectic spectrum, but what truly defined Mill was his passionate, immutable belief that everyone was entitled to social justice, to be able to work with dignity at a fair wage, and to be able to live their lives unburdened by oppression and fear. Mill marched for civil rights and for the rights of women to choose their reproductive destinies. He found war and aggression and imperialism abhorrent.

2004-04-26,"Paid Notice: Deaths   EDELMAN, WILLIAM","EDELMAN--William. 82, died April 23, surrounded by his beloved family. At his side were his children, Norma Penn, Neil Edelman, Terry Tannenbaum, son-in-law David Penn, daughter-in-law Shelley Edelman and his grandchildren Jonathan, Ricki, Jeremy, Jessica, Jillian, Ryanne and Evan. William's beloved wife Esther had passed away suddenly in 1991. Both of them, Holocaust survivors, had endured so many difficult years of devastating experiences and the annihilation of most of their families. Yet, together they persevered, overcame their tragedies and created a wonderful and loving life for them and their children here, in America. William was a man of slight build, but a ''Giant of a Man'' as he towered among everyone with his kindness, generosity, intellect, warmth and love. For he was truly ''over 10 feet tall.'' He leaves a legacy to those who knew and loved him as a relative, friend and business associate, of a human being who knew how to live, how to survive, how to deal with life's adversities. There was always a warm greeting, a kind word, and a true interest in your well-being when you were with William. You knew he cared about you and you respected him and loved him for it. William was born on December 27, 1921 in BiallerPodliask, Poland, one of five children. At the age of 19, he left for Russia as the Nazis entered Poland. He joined the Russian army and fought in a Polish division. He and one other member of his division were the sole survivors of a brutal onslaught by the Nazis. At the end of the war he returned to his hometown to see if anyone else had survived. His entire famlily with the exception of one sister had been slaughtered. It was upon his return that he met Esther, who, with one of her sisters, were the sole survivors of their family. He eventually married Esther and lived in a Displaced Persons Camp, where their first child Norma was born. Soon thereafter in 1950, the family left for America, where they first settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. William was a butcher, struggling and working to support and feed three children, which now included Neil and Terry. At the same time, he attended Brooklyn College in an effort to educate himself with the hope and expectation of being able to create a better life for his family. He managed, in spite of the financial difficulties, to save money and miraculously became a Real Estate Builder and Developer. He actually had to leave college a few credits short of a Bachelor of Science Degree because the business had grown to such an extent that it required 100% of his time. In the late 1950s William became a major developer of the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and in Staten Island. In the 1970s he built The Georgetowne hi-rise on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. Eventually his son Neil and son-inlaw David joined the business. Throughout the 1950s and even today, he and his firm, Forest View, and the Georgetowne are well-regarded and respected in the building construction industry. William was a member of the Board of Directors of the Israeli Humanitarian Foundation and Secretary of the Bialler Society (an organization of survivors of the Holocaust from the area surrounding his birthplace). William will truly be missed by all those whose paths he crossed, but the experience of life took on a unique meaning for each of them because of the richness of what he had imparted, for William was truly a ''Gentleman.''",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/26/classified/paid-notice-deaths-edelman-william.html

The beloved husband of Maria, the adored father of Christina and CJ and the cherished grandfather to Charles and Jeremiah Reen, died peacefully of natural causes on Sunday, April 25. He was 91. The son of immigrant parents and born in the Tremont section of the Bronx, Charles' abundant life was the quintessential American success story. At a young age, Charles formed the values and character that made him legendary to friends and strangers alike throughout his life. He placed utmost importance on integrity, loyalty and commitment, so much that he altered his driver's license by two years in order to join the New York Fire Department. As a Fireman 1st Class with Ladder Company 13, Charles was awarded the Walter Scott Medal for Exceptional Valor by Mayor O'Dwyer on June 3, 1946. To rescue a trapped man, Charles forced his way into a blazing building even before other firemen could put a hose to the flames or clear the place of smoke or gas. He carried the man to safety. After retiring from the NYFD, Charles and his brothers founded what became Edenwald Contracting Co, Inc. of Whitestone, Queens. By the 1980's, Edenwald had grown to become one of the largest municipal and utility contractors in New York. During his time, Charles with his brother George were the Chief Executives of the firm which performed hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects prior to 1994. Edenwald was also responsible for such notable projects as the US Open Tennis Center in Flushing, NY, and the award-winning Washington Market Park in Tribeca. First Lady Nancy Reagan honored Charles and his company's contributions to its design and construction. In later years, Charles became a successful developer in association with the Rockefeller Group in Mount Olive, NJ, and also throughout Whitestone, Queens. Charles spent these later years devoted to his family, especially his grandsons, Charlie and Jeremiah, whose presence for a man so advanced in age was the greatest gift God could bestow. Family, friends and acquaintances honor and treasure the memory of someone so trusted that his word was his bond, and truly a man among men.

2004-04-27,Metro Briefing | Connecticut: Windsor Locks: Italian Held In Homicide,"An Italian citizen who the police said had arranged a triple murder at an auto body shop here last July was charged last week in Italy with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Italy, which has outlawed capital punishment, has agreed to extradite the man, Benedetto Cipriani, 48, under the terms of an agreement with prosecutors, who agreed not to seek the death penalty. Sgt. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said yesterday that Mr. Cipriani was arrested last week outside Rome. In December, three men were charged with murder in the deaths of the two men who owned B & B Automotive in Windsor Locks and a mechanic who worked there. Court records suggest that the killings may have been the bitter ending of Mr. Cipriani's love affair with the wife of one of the owners.

2004-04-27,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Qwest Changes Rules On Some Carrier Fees,"Qwest Communications International said yesterday that it would not bill other carriers fees of about a half-cent a minute to connect callers who use a high-speed Internet connection to reach Qwest local-telephone customers. Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest local telephone company, said that it was urging the Federal Communications Commission to adopt similar rules nationally. Denver-based Qwest is using the policy in its local-service territory, which covers 14 Western states. Qwest said it was the only one of the four regional phone carriers known as Baby Bells to adopt such a stance. The move comes as Internet-phone start-ups like Vonage Holdings increasingly take customers from local carriers, which are also starting to offer similar services, as Qwest has done. The move will not have a big financial effect on the company, because less than 1 percent of Qwest's call-connection fees comes from Internet-phone services, Qwest's senior vice president, R. Steven Davis, said. The company collects several hundred million dollars annually in total fees, said Mr. Davis, who could not immediately provide a precise number. The policy would speed the spread of so-called voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP services, and would benefit customers, the industry and Qwest, the company said. Qwest shares rose 4 cents, to $4.29.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-qwest-changes-rules-on-some-carrier-fees.html

The man, Philip Generoso, 47, developed an acute case of pneumonia while serving a one-and-a-half- to two-year sentence, and died on Feb. 4, 2003. An autopsy revealed that he had no spleen, and that because the spleen plays an important role in the body's immune system, its absence had probably contributed to his getting pneumonia. The police located Mr. Generoso's sister this month, and last week she told them that on Feb. 17, 2002, Mr. Generoso was assaulted, and so badly injured that his spleen was surgically removed.

In the first of three days of closed hearings this week in Eagle, Judge W. Terry Ruckriegle heard arguments about the relevance of the 19-year-old accuser's sexual history and whether the police improperly obtained statements and other evidence last summer from Mr. Bryant, 25. He is accused of raping the woman, a hotel employee but has said that the sex was consensual. The judge gave the two sides 15 days to submit briefs on the issue of whether to refer to the accuser as a victim, which the defense says implies Mr. Bryant's guilt.

The vote, after 90 minutes of discussion, was 156 to 84, according to the university's Web site. Nancy Weiss Malkiel, dean of the undergraduate college, called the vote a ''strong affirmation'' and said the focus now would be on implementing the plan and being sensitive to concerns raised by both faculty and students. Some critics had charged that Princeton students would be at a disadvantage in the job market and in graduate schools if Princeton gave fewer A's than other colleges.

The score is by Richard Thomas, and the book and lyrics are by Stewart Lee and Mr. Thomas. Before the show moves to New York, it will have a six-week tryout at the Orpheum Theater in San Francisco during the spring of 2005. The much-traveled musical had its premiere at the 2002 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

2004-04-28,'Plan of Attack': All the President's Mentors," On April 19 - the day the American Revolution began in 1775 - Bob Woodward released ''Plan of Attack'' with a fusillade of publicity that will not soon be equaled. The shot heard round Washington benefited from several factors, including its timing. Stirred up by the recent revelations of Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill, the turmoil over the 9/11 commission and the dawning sense that our Iraq problems are not going away soon, the news media rolled out the red carpet for a book that was rumored to be more critical of the Bush administration - and therefore important - than Woodward's previous reporting. The result has been a little difficult to decipher amid the cacophony of television chatter and White House denials (to say nothing of the ka-ching of cash registers). But a serious book it is, instantly essential, matching America's most celebrated political reporter against the most secretive administration in our history.

The deal, which must still be approved by Brazilian regulators, is the latest foray into South America by Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican billionaire who controls Telmex and its wireless sister company, America Móvil.

Bloomberg, who intended it to tamp down on disruptive students. Like Joel I. Klein, the schools chancellor, Mr. Tucker is a former Justice Department official. No reason has been given for Mr. Tucker's resignation, but the mayor's sweeping reorganization of the school system has caused long delays in suspending or removing such students. And over the last few months, Mr. Tucker has been at the center of an intense effort by the Bloomberg administration to flood the city's most dangerous schools with police officers and new security measures.

2004-04-28,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HESS, JOHN D.","HESS--John D., a pioneering writer for television and a 50 year resident of Bucks County, PA., died peacefully at his home on Thursday, April 15, 2004, two days short of his 86th birthday. Mr. Hess was the husband of Mary Ann Van Hess and the late Jane Vosper Hess who died in 1996. Mr. Hess was born in Chicago. His father Carl died when John was three years old. He was raised by his mother, Ollie, and stepfather, Dr. J.P. Greenhill. He graduated from the University of Chicago Lab School in 1935, and-with distinction-from Dartmouth in 1939, where he pursued his lifelong ambition to be a writer. After a post-graduate year at Yale Drama School, he began his professional career as a staff writer for WGN radio in Chicago. His work was interrupted when he enlisted in the army in July 1942. Mr. Hess trained at the army's Advanced Tank Officers School, and joined his unit, the 743rd Armored Battalion, in Europe as a second lieutenant in September 1944. He served as the 743rd's transportation officer, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and other major engagements in Belgium, Holland and Germany. After the defeat of Germany, he assisted victims of concentration camps and helped relocate refugees throughout Europe. Prior to his repatriation to the U.S., in September 1945, he authored Move Out, Verify The Combat Story of the 743rd Tank Battalion, a history of tank combat in WWII. He was honorably discharged as a captain in January 1946. After the war, he returned to Chicago, resuming his position at WGN as a contributing writer for the station's nationally broadcast radio programs. He also authored short stories for magazines such as Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. In 1950, Mr. Hess originated and wrote a live-broadcast television soap opera called ''Love of Life'', which ran for thirty years. He also wrote other leading daytime soaps, including ''Secret Storm'' and ''General Hospital''. He supplemented this with concurrent work in the theatre, his first love. In 1953, his controversial play, ''The Gray Eyed People'' was produced on Broadway, starring Walter Matthau, with direction by Morton Da Costa. He also was deeply involved with Mike Ellis' Bucks County Playhouse in the 1950's and 1960's where his plays ''The Facts of Life'', ''The Better Mousetrap,'' and ''A Perfect Frenzy'' premiered. In 1959, his original feature-length television mystery ''The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deeks'' was broadcast by Ford Startime to critical acclaim. Starring Alec Guiness in his American television debut, it was directed by Franklin Schaffner. In 1961, he wrote and produced a feature movie thriller '' Matter of Morals'' starring Patrick O'Neal and Maj-Britt Nillson. Directed by Hollywood veteran John Cromwell, the film was released by Twentieth Century Fox. Over the next two and a half decades, Mr. Hess wrote for a virtual who's who of major nighttime television series. His work included episodes of comedies, ''MASH'', ''Alice'' and ''One Day At A Time'', and dramas, ''Streets of San Francisco'', ''The Rockford Files'', and ''Ben Casey''. Mr. Hess' principal home was New Hope, PA, where he was active in community affairs. Following the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ann Van. They lived together in Bucks County from 1997 to his death. In addition to his wife, Mr. Hess is survived by sons Anthony G. Hess of New Hope and Oliver G. Hess of Ojai, CA, his brother Carl B. Hess of New York, and grandsons John T. and Carl T. Hess of Ojai. Services private. Memorial donations in Mr. Hess's name may be made to the John D.

2004-04-29,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HESS, JOHN D.","HESS--John D., a pioneering writer for television and a 50 year resident of Bucks County, PA., died peacefully at his home on Thursday, April 15, 2004, two days short of his 86th birthday. Mr. Hess was the husband of Mary Ann Van Hess and the late Jane Vosper Hess who died in 1996. Mr. Hess was born in Chicago. His father Carl died when John was three years old. He was raised by his mother, Ollie, and stepfather, Dr. J.P. Greenhill. He graduated from the University of Chicago Lab School in 1935, and-with distinction-from Dartmouth in 1939, where he pursued his lifelong ambition to be a writer. After a post-graduate year at Yale Drama School, he began his professional career as a staff writer for WGN radio in Chicago. His work was interrupted when he enlisted in the army in July 1942. Mr. Hess trained at the army's Advanced Tank Officers School, and joined his unit, the 743rd Armored Battalion, in Europe as a second lieutenant in September 1944. He served as the 743rd's transportation officer, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and other major engagements in Belgium, Holland and Germany. After the defeat of Germany, he assisted victims of concentration camps and helped relocate refugees throughout Europe. Prior to his repatriation to the U.S., in September 1945, he authored Move Out, Verify The Combat Story of the 743rd Tank Battalion, a history of tank combat in WWII. He was honorably discharged as a captain in January 1946. After the war, he returned to Chicago, resuming his position at WGN as a contributing writer for the station's nationally broadcast radio programs. He also authored short stories for magazines such as Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. In 1950, Mr. Hess originated and wrote a live-broadcast television soap opera called ''Love of Life'', which ran for thirty years. He also wrote other leading daytime soaps, including ''Secret Storm'' and ''General Hospital''. He supplemented this with concurrent work in the theatre, his first love. In 1953, his controversial play, ''The Gray Eyed People'' was produced on Broadway, starring Walter Matthau, with direction by Morton Da Costa. He also was deeply involved with Mike Ellis' Bucks County Playhouse in the 1950's and 1960's where his plays ''The Facts of Life'', ''The Better Mousetrap,'' and ''A Perfect Frenzy'' premiered. In 1959, his original feature-length television mystery ''The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deeks'' was broadcast by Ford Startime to critical acclaim. Starring Alec Guiness in his American television debut, it was directed by Franklin Schaffner. In 1961, he wrote and produced a feature movie thriller '' Matter of Morals'' starring Patrick O'Neal and Maj-Britt Nillson. Directed by Hollywood veteran John Cromwell, the film was released by Twentieth Century Fox. Over the next two and a half decades, Mr. Hess wrote for a virtual who's who of major nighttime television series. His work included episodes of comedies, ''MASH'', ''Alice'' and ''One Day At A Time'', and dramas, ''Streets of San Francisco'', ''The Rockford Files'', and ''Ben Casey''. Mr. Hess' principal home was New Hope, PA, where he was active in community affairs. Following the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ann Van. They lived together in Bucks County from 1997 to his death. In addition to his wife, Mr. Hess is survived by sons Anthony G. Hess of New Hope and Oliver G. Hess of Ojai, CA, his brother Carl B. Hess of New York, and grandsons John T. and Carl T. Hess of Ojai. Services private. Memorial donations in Mr. Hess's name may be made to the John D.

2004-04-29,Taking High-End Furniture Down Just a Notch,"Tomorrow, Sills Huniford Associates, the decorating firm, will open Dwellings, a Manhattan shop offering to the public lower-end versions of the firm's famously expensive couture furniture for private clients. The venture could be seen as one of several recent efforts by the partners, Stephen Sills (on left, inset) and James Huniford (right), to redeem their reputations after a 2000 New York magazine article detailed complaints from clients who thought they had wildly overpaid for antiques and other furnishings (charges the partners have denied). Mr. Sills said the store would attract ''a young, upwardly mobile'' customer with ''a lot of money'' -- though not necessarily as much as his clients usually spend. Mr. Huniford said he envisioned customers who dress in Stella McCartney ready-to-wear and have never decorated before. They said they were not worried about diverting clients who typically pay twice as much for similarly styled pieces, custom-made with somewhat better materials. The store, with dead-simple décor, offers the firm's Southampton Cube armchair ($2,650), Plaster Column lamp ($1,400) and Tufted Back sofa ($5,800), above the inset; and vintage pieces, including a $14,500 pair of painted dressers and an abandoned beehive ($3,800), top right. Mr. Huniford described Dwellings as a converted floor-through on the second floor of a town house, although the location might better be described as occupying the third floor, above a celebrity dermatologist.
