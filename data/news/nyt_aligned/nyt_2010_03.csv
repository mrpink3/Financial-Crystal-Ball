Sondheim,"The Tony Award winner Donna Murphy has been cast in the coming New York City Center Encores! revival of “Anyone Can Whistle,” the Stephen Sondheim-Arthur Laurents musical that closed on Broadway after only nine performances in 1964. Ms. Murphy, who has won two Tony Awards for best actress in a musical  for “Passion” (1994) and the 1996 revival of “The King and I”  will play the role of Mayor Cora Hoover Hooper, which was originally played by Angela Lansbury in her Broadway musical debut. This early Sondheim work was regarded at the time as experimental and absurdist, and both audience and critical reaction tended to be negative. Yet the musical, a satire of small-town life and politics led by the corrupt mayor, also became a cult favorite among some Sondheim fans and others. The City Center production, which also stars the previously announced Sutton Foster (“Thoroughly Modern Millie”), will be the final Encores! show of the season, scheduled to run for five performances April 8 to 11.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/arts/02arts-DONNAMURPHYI_BRF.html

Bronson (Luke Welch) spends some time explaining to his love interest that his entire life, including his decision to strap on a gun, has been a response to the humiliations visited on him because of his diminutive stature. Synopses of the movie on the Internet either do not mention this prominent aspect of the plot or touch on it only in passing, perhaps because it seems so much at odds with the figure Bronson cut (often semi-naked) in a series of famous movies — “The Magnificent Seven,” “The Great Escape,” “Hard Times,” “Chato’s Land,” “Mr. Majestyk” and, of course, in what sometimes seemed to be a series of innumerable and increasingly violent “Death Wish” movies.Bronson is by no means the only action star whose larger than life screen persona was or is at odds with his “real-life” statistics. (Just what those statistics are is often debated on Web sites where there may be a three-inch variation in the height assigned to a particular actor.) The pattern was set in the 1930s and ’40s by Edward G. Robinson (“Little Caesar”), James Cagney, George Raft, Humphrey Bogart and Paul Muni — all small men who usually played tough and cruel.

2010-03-02,Now Bagging | Whitney Biennial Tote,"For a cultural institution interested in promotional items, the tote bag is king. They are to museums and public radio stations what T-shirts are to rock bands, what bumper stickers are to middle school honor rolls. This limited-edition tote ($98) by Tommy Hilfiger celebrates the just-opened 2010 Whitney Biennial and highlights the work of one of its artists, Ari Marcopoulos. A New York photographer of Dutch extraction and a former assistant to Andy Warhol, Marcopoulos is known for the great lengths he’ll go to to get a picture, whether it’s shadowing the Beastie Boys or chasing snowboarders down the Alps. The image on this tote bag comes from “Detroit,” Marcopoulos’s video piece in the Biennial, about two boys who make electronic music in a small Detroit bedroom using little more than foot effect pedals. Marcopoulos was given an advance copy of the bag, which went on sale Thursday, and he approved of it. “I thought it was going to be a really cheap tote bag,” he said. “But it’s functional. And when I wore it, people on the subway were checking me out.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/now-bagging-whitney-biennial-tote/

Kim created it especially for her roommate, the fashion photographer Brooke Nipar, who had lost a tooth in a bar fight; she cast it in gold and hung it from a detachable chain so that Nipar could pop it in her mouth or wear it around her neck with pride. Meanwhile, the London artist William Hunt has created a limited-edition set of silver cuff links made from casts of the wisdom teeth he had removed as a “performance” in art school. The three Six Six Six girls, whose macabre design line is named Triskaidekaphobia after the fear of the number 13, offer spiky silver bangles and slinky pendants sculptured from metal baby teeth; the San Francisco gothic brand Loved to Death offers actual human baby teeth set in gold, Victorian-inspired settings.

The original production was choreographed by Fyodor Lopukhov and first performed in 1935 in Leningrad. The ballet will also be performed during the company’s spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, which will run from May 16 through July 9, 2011.

In a statement, TLC said that it was happy to have been “part of the modernization and revitalization of the Miss America Pageant,” but was declining to renew its contract to show the event. The competition, which dates to 1921, was among the highest-rated television broadcasts in its 1960s-era heyday, but has been bounced from suitor to suitor since NBC stopped showing it after 1996. ABC ran the pageant from 1997 to 2005, then the country-music channel CMT in 2006 and 2007, before TLC picked it up in 2008. The 2010 pageant, won by Miss Virginia, Caressa Cameron, was watched by 4.5 million people in January, a record for the competition since it moved to cable.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/arts/television/03arts-CABLESTLCDRO_BRF.html
2010-03-03,Comic Book Writer Accused of Plagiarism,"Nick Simmons, the son of the rock star Gene Simmons, sought to make a name for himself in the comic book industry as the writer and artist of “Incarnate,” a manga-style series from Radical Publishing. The attempt may have backfired. Last week the publisher announced plans to halt production of a collected edition of “Incarnate” after Internet message boards filled up with accusations that Mr. Simmons had copied layouts, dialogue and character designs from other manga series, including “Bleach” and “Hellsing.” On Monday Mr. Simmons said in a statement that the similarities were “meant as an homage to artists I respect, and I definitely want to apologize to any manga fans or fellow manga artists who feel I went too far.” He continued, “My inspirations reflect the fact that certain fundamental imagery is common to all manga.” Many readers weren’t buying it. “Note that he doesn’t acknowledge he went beyond ‘homage’ to flat-out copies,” wrote Johanna Draper Carlson, who reviews manga at comicsworthreading.com. (Above left, a drawing from “Bleach.” Right, one from “Incarnate.”)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/books/03arts-COMICBOOKWRI_BRF.html
2010-03-03,"In Return Engagement, Leno Routs Letterman","Let the Leno-Letterman jousting resume. Jay Leno’s return to “The Tonight Show” on Monday was watched by about 6.6 million viewers, according to overnight Nielsen ratings, up about 25 percent from his average viewership in the first quarter of last year. David Letterman’s “Late Show” on CBS was watched by 3.8 million, about average for his program. “The Tonight Show” was the No. 1 late-night offering when Mr. Leno, right, handed it over to Conan O’Brien last spring. In the months that followed, the “Late Show” routinely beat Mr. O’Brien’s “Tonight” in total viewers. In January, after NBC canceled Mr. Leno’s 10 p.m. talk show and announced a plan to move him back to 11:35 p.m., Mr. O’Brien left the network. Mr. Leno’s “Tonight Show” return was heavily promoted during the Winter Olympics on NBC last month, but once the initial interest fades the real competition will begin, as NBC and CBS find out whether “The Tonight Show” can return to the No. 1 spot among total viewers  as if a certain redheaded comedian had never been there.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/arts/television/03arts-INRETURNENGA_BRF.html
2010-03-03,Crudup to Star in ‘The Metal Children’,"The actor Billy Crudup, whose last major New York performance won him a Tony Award, for Tom Stoppard’s “Coast of Utopia” during the 2006-07 season, will star in the world premiere of Adam Rapp’s play “The Metal Children” at the Vineyard Theater in May. The play, to be directed by Mr. Rapp for the Off Broadway theater, is about a New York writer who travels to a small American town to defend one of his young-adult novels that has been banned by the school board, a confrontation that turns into a heated debate about religious beliefs and censorship. Mr. Crudup won the Tony for best featured actor in a play in 2007 for his performance as the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky in the first two parts of “The Coast of Utopia.” He had been nominated twice before for best actor in a play, for “The Pillowman” in 2005 and the revival of “The Elephant Man” in 2002.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/theater/03arts-CRUDUPTOSTAR_BRF.html
2010-03-03,‘Venus In Fur’ Eyes Broadway,"The producer Robert Fox is exploring transferring the Classic Stage Company’s production of “Venus in Fur” to a Broadway theater, Mr. Fox said on Tuesday. The new play, by David Ives, received wide critical acclaim when it opened in January, especially for one of its stars, the newcomer Nina Arianda, who plays a somewhat mysterious actress who becomes caught up in a sexual psychodrama during an audition for a director (played by Wes Bentley, of the film “American Beauty”). Mr. Fox, the lead producer of “God of Carnage” and a lead producer of the new Broadway production “A Behanding in Spokane,” said he had begun talking to New York theater owners about a transfer. Chief among the factors for such a move, he said, would be the availability of “a very intimate house” for the two-character work. He did not specify which theaters he preferred and cautioned that no deal was in place, and that the timing would largely depend on a theater becoming available. The Off Broadway run of “Venus in Fur,” directed by Walter Bobbie (“Chicago”), has been extended twice and is now scheduled to end on March 28.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/theater/03arts-VENUSINFUREY_BRF.html

But like many people who have discovered Hannah’s work and fallen in love with it, I’d become a little obsessed with knowing more about him.

Sonoma will be the first county in the Bay Area to participate in the department’s “Secure Communities” program. Critics say the program gives local law enforcement officials a bigger role in immigration enforcement, which is conducted by the federal government. The program, which began in late 2008, is now used in 10 California counties, including Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego. “This is a common-sense approach: Everyone who gets arrested gets checked for immigration status,” said Matt McCaffrey, a sheriff’s captain. “In this case, they’re already in the system for entering into the country illegally or for having a record.” Separately, a United States district court judge will hold a hearing on Wednesday in Oakland on a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, accusing the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office of routinely holding Latinos longer than the maximum 72 hours for immigration detention.

2010-03-03,Home Is Where the Art Is,"As The Times reported back in December, galleries all over the city are moving from the storefront to the home front. The latest addition to this mini-movement? Paul Johnson of Johnson Trading, a design gallery on Greenwich Street, just opened a show called “Home” in the Chrystie Street loft he calls, well, his home. The subject of the show is the self-taught 60-something outsider artist Robert Loughlin. Loughlin spent most of his life being a picker (or chineur), one of those people scouring flea markets looking for rare resalable gems among the rummage — always in the hopes of “selling Andy Warhol a cookie jar,” as the writer Irwin Warren put it in his foreword for the show’s program. Johnson started out as a picker himself, and about 10 years ago he began buying pieces from the back of Loughlin’s pickup truck at the old Chelsea flea market. His collection now comprises more than 500 pieces, from chairs, canvases, record covers, advertising posters and other bizarre objects — ivory teeth and baby seats — all scribbled on with Loughlin’s Tom of Finland-esque signature smoking head, obsessively filling every single one of the loft’s 4,500 square feet. To this day, Loughlin still peddles his pieces (for $300 and up) at the Chelsea flea market, but it is unlikely anybody will ever be able to accumulate a collection of similar size or quality as Johnson’s (not to mention as elegantly hung by the decorator to the stars Ricky Clifton). “I definitely have enough now, and I don’t have any more space in my house,” says Johnson when asked whether he’ll continue collecting Loughlin. He pauses, before adding “Unless it’s really good.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/home-is-where-the-art-is/

2010-03-04,Striking Poses,"“I am cursed to be in this Mother Hubbard body,” Alice Neel once remarked of her grandmotherly image. The artist’s sensitivity to nuances of style and gesture informs the portraits in “Alice Neel: Painted Truths,” a retrospective opening on March 21 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Since her portrait work was largely uncommissioned and did not require that she flatter the sitter, “you get a sense of how people really looked,” says Barry Walker, who, with Jeremy Lewison, curated the show. That’s as true for the cheerful Fuller Brush man and Dachau survivor who showed up on her doorstep in 1965 as it is for the art-world elites who (eventually) posed for her — including the Factory’s Ritta Redd and Jackie Curtis and Andy Warhol himself, seminude and scarred. (Neel was notorious for sweet-talking her subjects out of their clothes.) When faced with truly stylish subjects, like the art-world players John Gruen and Jane Wilson and their daughter, Neel focused on the psychological — the self-assured couple and the young girl, hunched like a figure out of Munch — but she didn’t neglect the clothes.

Klein responded that yes, “the bill might cost $2.3 trillion” in its second decade, but over that period “it either raises or saves $2.95 trillion, for a net deficit impact of negative $650 billion.” Ryan, he suggested, was using “the classic ‘This Is A Big Number’ technique to imply that the bill is financially irresponsible, when putting the number in context would show just the opposite.”",Blogs,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/why-size-matters/

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, the center announced on Wednesday. In a telephone interview Mr. Rubenstein, 60, said he hoped to attract younger audiences  “people who don’t have hair color like mine”  to the center. He added that he also sees taking the post as a chance to help combat the “increasing divide in Washington between Republicans and Democrats,” since “the arts help bring people together."" Mr. Rubenstein, a Washingtonian who has been on the Kennedy Center board since 2004, will succeed the financier Stephen A. Schwarzman after the May board meeting. Mr. Rubenstein helped start the 23-year-old Carlyle Group, which now manages more than $87 billion from 19 offices around the world. He serves on the boards of about 30 major institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution, Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. “I do intend to narrow down the philanthropic commitments I have,” Mr. Rubenstein said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/arts/design/04arts-FINANCIERTOH_BRF.html

2010-03-04,Flying Elephant on Broadway?,"Disney Theatrical Productions and Stephen Daldry, the Tony Award-wining director of “Billy Elliot: The Musical,” are developing an adaptation for the stage of the 1941 classic animated movie “Dumbo,” a Disney executive said on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Daldry approached Disney Theatrical several months ago with a concept for a “Dumbo” musical, and they are now in “the very initial stages” of shaping those ideas, according to the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the company does not comment on projects at such an early stage. No creative team  composers, book writers, designers, and so on  has been assembled, the executive said, but doing so would probably be the next step. “Dumbo,” of course, already comes with several songs from the movie, including “Baby Mine”  which was nominated for the Academy Award for best song  as well as “Casey Junior” and “When I See An Elephant Fly.” The film won the Oscar for best original score. It is too early to say when the musical, if ultimately realized, would come to Broadway, or if it would start out in London as “Billy Elliot” did (Mr. Daldry is British) or in another major theatrical city other than New York, the executive said. “Let’s put it this way, ‘Dumbo’ will not be on Broadway in the 2010-11 season, because it’s simply in the very early stages,” the executive said. The New York Post on Wednesday reported Disney’s interest in developing “Dumbo” for the stage, though The Post said that Mr. Daldry had passed on the project because he and Disney could not come to terms. The Disney executive said that Mr. Daldry has always been aboard.

2010-03-04,Executive Casualties at War-Game Maker,"The runaway success of the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has given way to corporate hostilities. On Tuesday the heads of the game studio Infinity Ward, which produces the Call of Duty games for the publisher Activision Blizzard, abruptly left that company under unclear circumstances, Reuters reported. Activision said that Jason West, the Infinity Ward president, and Vince Zampella, the studio’s chief executive, had both departed. In a statement and in a regulatory filing reported by Reuters, Activision said it was investigating “breaches of contract and insubordination by two senior employees at Infinity Ward,” but did not name the employees. The game publisher also said it was starting its own business unit to produce future Call of Duty titles, and that the decision was unrelated to the exits of Mr. West and Mr. Zampella. Infinity Ward, which released the original Call of Duty game in 2003, was acquired by Activision that same year. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which was released in November, became one of the best-selling games of all time, grossing an estimated $310 million in sales in its first day of release and selling more than 12 million copies over all. Activision has two more Call of Duty games planned for 2010 and 2011, neither developed by Infinity Ward.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/arts/television/04arts-EXECUTIVECAS_BRF.html

They surfaced with a copy preserved, strangely enough, on micro­film, and soon Johnson was reading the dimly remembered passage in which a woman keels over, blood gushing from her nose and ears as she raves about disconnected facts.

For many writers, especially those in midcareer or of midrange repute, death is the best (and last) great sales push they ever get.

The hurdles are many, with one of the biggest simply finding ways to acquire broad stretches of land that can accommodate the wandering species. Another is consolidating a maze of local, state and federal policies that treat the animals in different ways. Many Western states, for instance, classify bison as livestock and not wildlife, the report authors say, hampering how they can be managed in the wild. Here’s the full report on restoring bison.

In recent years, older and more mature, he has been captivated by images of the future, sometimes blending them with the past. Along the way he established separate lines, for knits, silks and limited editions, that helped to make Balenciaga profitable, but when it comes to the collections he presents in Paris, there has almost always been a sense of a designer free to create. That was again the invigorating experience this morning at the Hôtel de Crillon, on a specially installed white laboratory floor, where Mr. Ghesquiere showed a highly textured collection that looked well beyond the fall of 2010.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/balenciaga-domestic-studies/

2010-03-04,In Search of a Jewish Narnia,"Why is there no Jewish Narnia? That’s the provocative question raised by Michael Weingrad’s essay on Judaism and fantasy novels, published in the inaugural issue of the Jewish Review of Books.  Note that Weingrad is talking about fantasy as a genre, not the use of the fantastic as a literary tool. (So the existence of Kafka and Isaac Bashevis Singer does not disprove his thesis.) And note, as well, that the piece is not entitled “Why Are There No Jewish Fantasy Novelists?” To the extent that Weingrad raises that question, he’s pretty easily refuted. But really he’s raising a deeper issue, one that goes to the nature of the genre itself: “Why are there no works of modern fantasy that are profoundly Jewish in the way that, say, ‘The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe’ is Christian?

2010-03-04,Laws for Sale," Plaintiffs’ lawyers must be holding their heads a little higher when they walk into P.T.A. meetings and neighborhood parties these days, knowing that corporate lobbyists have overtaken them as the most despised professionals in America. Lobbyists have never been especially popular, of course; even their most sympathetic pop-culture portrayal, in the book and better-known movie “Thank You for Smoking,” focused mostly on their moral depravity. As a candidate, Barack Obama made a point of vowing to banish them from the White House. (This proved considerably harder to do than it was to say, mostly because it turns out that lobbyists in Washington are like Baathists in Baghdad; if you send them all home, there aren’t enough people left who know anything about running a government.) In the past year, though, antilobbyist fervor has grown even more intense, as hope for a new governing era has given way to frustration with a divided capital and a dysfunctional Congress.

This aria of hypersensual book love is not my favorite performance. I sometimes suspect that those who gush about book odor might not like to read. If they did, why would they waste so much time inhaling? Among the best features of the Kindle, Amazon’s great e-reader, is that there’s none of that. The device, which consigns all poetry and prose to the same homely fog-toned screen, leaves nothing to the experience of books but reading. This strikes me as honest, even revolutionary.

I think that there are much larger questions to be addressed when thinking about local and default national curriculum guidelines. Questions like “What is history?” and “How should education happen in a democracy?” force us as a country, as policymakers and as educators to think about our larger goals in designing our education system and the curriculum that is taught. Do we want to indoctrinate students of all ages into thinking that our country’s history provides a clear and simplistic narrative, or do we want to pose difficult, challenging questions to students while giving them access to legitimate opinions and sources? If we are truly educating our youth to be active citizens in a democracy who can think for themselves, teaching must encourage students to grapple with multiple perspectives, ask provocative questions and develop theories that can be supported with evidence.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07letters-t-004.html

The producers of “Billy Elliot: The Musical” said that a Korean-language version of the show, adapted from the 2000 Stephen Daldry film, would play in Seoul starting in August after years of planning that began long before “Billy Elliot” won the 2009 Tony Award for best musical. In a telephone interview on Thursday Eric Fellner, a co-chairman of Working Title Films, which produced the “Billy Elliot” movie and its stage incarnations, said that the company was approached about foreign versions of the musical about five years ago, just as the original West End show was starting up. Local actors have been hired for the South Korean cast, including a team of four young Billys, and some dialogue or other minor elements may be changed to suit the hometown crowd. But over all the show will remain intact, and the show’s American design and construction team has built the sets for the Seoul production. Mr. Fellner said that a Japanese version of the “Billy Elliot” musical was being prepared for the summer of 2011, and talks were continuing with German and Dutch producers.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/theater/05arts-BILLYELLIOTL_BRF.html

Mr. Blair, the former British prime minister, said that the book, to be called “The Journey,” would give his perspectives on the lead-up to the Iraq war, peace negotiations in Northern Ireland and his relationship with his successor, Gordon Brown. “I have tried to write a book which describes the human as much as the political dimensions of life as prime minister,” Mr. Blair said in a statement.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/books/05arts-SARAHPALINAN_BRF.html

In reversing the November 2008 decision by Justice Marilyn Shafer of the New York State Supreme Court, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled on Feb. 25 that there was “no statutory requirement that the commission adhere to a particular procedure in determining whether to consider a property for designation.” As a result, the ruling stated, “the court erred in holding the commission’s conduct arbitrary and capricious” with respect to five properties. The appellate court also ruled that the Citizens Emergency Committee to Preserve Preservation, which filed the lawsuit against the commission’s top officials, “failed to demonstrate standing to sue.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/arts/design/05arts-NEWYORKLANDM_BRF.html

On Tuesday the cable channel said it had officially ordered “Game of Thrones,” a new series based on George R. R. Martin’s “Song of Ice and Fire” fantasy novels.

The principal cast of the HBO series, which will run 10 episodes, features no less than 17 members, including Mark Addy, above left; Sean Bean; Peter Dinklage; Jennifer Ehle, above right; Iain Glen; and Lena Headey; as well as Tamzin Merchant (of “Pride and Prejudice”) as the heroine Daenerys Targaryen.

And for now Mr. Cameron, the “Avatar” and “Titanic” filmmaker, says he still plans to produce a movie about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though a book about the subject that he optioned has been withdrawn by its publisher amid questions about its accuracy. The publisher, Henry Holt & Company, said that it would stop shipping and printing copies of “The Last Train From Hiroshima” by Charles Pellegrino, a nonfiction account of the World War II mission to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and of the bombing’s victims. That decision came after the accounts of Joseph Fuoco, a source for the book who is characterized as a substitute flight engineer on the mission, were contradicted by scientists, historians and veterans. In an e-mail message to The Associated Press, Mr. Cameron defended Mr. Pellegrino. “All I know is that Charlie would not fabricate,” Mr. Cameron wrote, “so there must be a reason for the misunderstanding.” He added that his movie does not “have a shooting script and no decision has been made to proceed in the short term.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/movies/05arts-JAMESCAMERON_BRF.html

""If,"" writes Melena Ryzik, ""artistically, 'The Secret of Kells' is a throwback to the era of animation before computer-generated imagery, its promotion is pure digital age, forgoing the pricey ads and flashy parties that Academy Award campaigns are traditionally built on in favor of cheaper social media and savvy targeted marketing.

""Rich with pagan myth and Jungian symbolism, the movie is lavishly illustrated to mimic the perspectiveless style of pre-Renaissance art: it's not exactly lightweight fare.""

Its season will now run for 25 weeks instead of 38. The orchestra said that its reduction, which was negotiated with the musicians, will eliminate three paid weeks of vacation for the players, five weeks of playing for BalletMet and Opera Columbus performances; and five weeks of special one-off concerts. Subscription concerts will be preserved, the orchestra said. The Columbus Symphony, a high-quality regional orchestra in Ohio’s capital, has been struggling financially for several years.

Such dangers make him anxious, but Watman has the enthusiast’s capacity for losing himself in recondite detail. He lovingly catalogs the ingredients of a whiskey mash on display at a supply store in upstate New York: “crystal six-row malted barley, torrefied wheat, Maris Otter, Belgian candy sugar, flaked maize, amylase enzymes.” He minutely recounts his distillation experiments, but the tone is less instructional than slapstick. “After three sips, my mouth was numb,” he says about one of his early batches of whiskey.

They can be maps of the designer’s mind as well as maps of terrain, concerned not just with topography but with typography too. Some maps have gone down in design history as milestones of visual erudition, like Harry C. Beck’s London Underground map (1931-33) or Herbert Bayer’s World Geo-Graphic Atlas (1953), an exemplary marriage of information, art and design. But many maps are made only as art for art’s sake. In recent years, various exhibitions, catalogs and books have been devoted to assaying the cartographic arts and crafts.

Mr. Zugazagoitia (pronounced zoo-gah-zah-GOY-tee-a) will replace Marc F. Wilson, one of the nation’s longest-serving museum directors, who last year announced his decision to retire after 28 years and after shepherding a $385 million capital campaign to strengthen the museum’s endowment and transform its Beaux-Arts complex with a glass-block addition by the architect Steven Holl. Mr. Zugazagoitia, 46, has run El Museo for almost eight years, a period of sweeping change for a small institution founded in 1969 as a haven for Puerto Rican culture. It has expanded its mission to focus more generally on Latino and Latin American art and under Mr. Zugazagoitia’s leadership it has substantially increased its budget, endowment, donations and audience. The museum reopened last fall after its own makeover, a $35 million renovation that added a new facade and courtyard and modernized its galleries. Sarah F. Rowland, chairwoman of the Nelson-Atkins board, said that the museum’s search committee had chosen Mr. Zugazagoitia from a field of about a dozen finalists because “his training and temperament are exactly what we had been looking for  his commitment to the arts is so broad.” Mr. Zugazagoitia said that he was excited about the chance to take over “an encyclopedic museum, the breadth and depth of whose collection is astounding.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/arts/design/06arts-NEWYORKERTOH_BRF.html

As editor of The Review, Mr. Stein will succeed Philip Gourevitch, the author and journalist who announced in November that he was stepping down. In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Stein said: “Part of what The Review is for me is not just a place for writers to publish things and for readers to read them, but at its best it can be a gateway drug.

In the ad, which began showing in Britain in February, he says, “Once a thing’s been done it’s been done.” He adds: “Looking backwards for inspiration, copying the past  how is that rock ’n’ roll? Do something of your own. Start something new.” The BBC reported that the commercial drew the ire of viewers who said that the singer’s widow, Yoko Ono, was exploiting his image. On Twitter, Sean Ono Lennon wrote: “I realize why people are mad.

The ruling, which came on Wednesday from a three-judge panel, sent the dispute back to the lower court to determine who, if anyone, had actually prevailed in the case. That determination would affect the assignment of responsibility for legal costs. Mr. Cussler filed suit against Crusader in 2004, asserting that it had violated its contract with him in making a film based on his novel “Sahara” and its fictional hero Dirk Pitt. Crusader then filed a cross-complaint that accused Mr. Cussler of contractual violations.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/movies/06arts-NEWPLOTTWIST_BRF.html

A British satire about a certain war in the Middle East, nominated for a screenplay Oscar, “In the Loop” is known for its bawdiness. The dinner, on Saturday night, was more tame – just a few jokes about Hitler as a motivational speaker and Jeff Bridges’s mustache being the best part of “Crazy Heart” – you know, the usual.

2010-03-08,How-To Hamlet,"""If you happen to be walking through the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan in the next several weeks,"" writes Steven McElory, ""be aware that a sword fight may erupt near you."" If so, do not panic; you are actually seeing actors from the New York Classical Theater production of ""Hamlet,"" starring, in the title role, Justin Blanchard, who will be rehearsing at the 3.5-acre center through March 25. The company, which has held open rehearsals in Battery Park and Central Park for years, is hoping to lure viewers by giving them a sneak peak at the process of how theater gets done. ""Throughout the season, the company will use an empty storefront at 1 New York Plaza as a production office and costume shop. Passers-by can wander into the office and observe costume fittings, take part in scheduled discussions with members of the creative staff and even  if they are so inclined  learn about more mundane aspects of putting on a show, like sending out mailers and doing paperwork.""",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/urbaneye/08ubn02.html

The South African artist directed the company's production of Shostakovich's early opera ""The Nose,"" which opened on Friday, and his sets and videos that animate the staging ""received the heartiest bravos."" The choice of Mr. Kentridge is another example of how Peter Gelb, the company's general manager, has made it a priority to recruit directors from theater and film. ""With Mr. Kentridge, whose work can now be seen in an extensive exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Gelb has brought in a major visual artist. Stop-action animation and theatrical design are central to Mr. Kentridge's work, and he has unleashed his imagination on Shostakovich's bitterly satirical and breathless opera."" The music is intriguing, too: ""you are not likely to hear a more insightful, ornery and, when appropriate, achingly poignant account of Shostakovich's still-shocking score than the performance the conductor Valery Gergiev drew from the Met orchestra and chorus and the large cast: some 30 artists, singing about 80 solo roles.""

Does it make one a better — a more profound — person? Would we love Catherine Deneuve more if she had consented to letting us see her age onscreen?

2010-03-09,The Bowery in Boston,"Boston is about to get a bit of the Bowery. The Bowery Presents, the company that puts on concerts at the Bowery Ballroom, Terminal 5 and other spaces in New York, has signed a long-term deal with the Royale club in Boston to be the exclusive presenter of live music there. The Royale, which until recently was called the Roxy, is a 1,000-capacity space on Tremont Street with an open floor and a U-shaped balcony. Known to Boston clubgoers as a late-night dance haunt, the Royale will be outfitted for live music and have about 100 concerts a year, said Jim Glancy, a partner in the Bowery Presents. The Royale will be the company’s first space outside the New York region. (It also helps run the Wellmont Theater in Montclair, N.J.) The Bowery will open a small office in Boston to run the Royale shows and book events for larger spaces. “It’s a fantastic market,” Mr. Glancy said. “The type of music we book totally lends itself to Boston.” That music is mainly rock, but as at Webster Hall in New York the Royale will continue to put on its own dance events independent of the rock shows. (After renovations the Royale will have its official reopening on Saturday, a dance night.) The first announced concert booking for the Royale is the reunited Public Image Limited on May 4 and 5, but Mr. Glancy and another Bowery partner, John Moore, said they expected to book others in April.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/arts/music/09arts-THEBOWERYINB_BRF.html

But he won’t have to share his “Avatar” profits with a Chinese writer who said the movie plagiarized his work. A court in Beijing has thrown out a lawsuit brought by the writer Zhou Shaomou, who said that the film closely resembled his novel “The Legend of the Blue Crow,” which he wrote in 1997 and published online in 1999, The Global Times of China reported. The author said his novel and “Avatar” shared 80 percent of their material, and was seeking 8 percent of the movie’s total revenue. A Chinese representative for 20th Century Fox, which released the film, told The Global Times that the story line for “Avatar” was first devised in 1995, two years before Mr. Zhou wrote his novel.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/movies/09arts-AVATARPLAGIA_BRF.html

2010-03-09,Samurai Shopper | Kiss and Makeup,"Nicolas Degennes is a rock star. He’s not in a band, though he spends loads of time backstage. He does live gigs, but his only instruments are buckets of savoir-faire and a genius for innovation. Degennes is the artistic director of Givenchy’s Le Makeup. He’s the inventor of Phenomen’eyes, that mold-breaking mascara with the mace-like, spiked applicator. He travels in very arty circles, and I bet he brings the house down wherever he goes. Women love him. Men love him, too. It’s because he talks to people, not at them. He also listens, makes eye contact, smiles. He’s unaffected, un-jaded, un-snobby. For a Frenchman, this is nothing short of miraculous. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/samurai-shopper-kiss-and-makeup/

It was a lavish production, needless to say, with classic tweeds, cute knits and thick fur chaps dragged through the enormous wading pool by the models. All the fur, by the way, was fake.

2010-03-09,Vain Glorious | A Scar Is Born,"In the play “Time Stands Still” (at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater through March 27), Laura Linney plays Sarah Goodwin, a war photographer badly injured by a bomb blast in Iraq. From the beginning, the director, Daniel Sullivan, and Linney knew that Goodwin’s visible scars would be an important facet of the production, so the actress suggested calling in Mindy Hall, an accomplished (and as of this past Sunday night, Academy Award-winning) makeup artist who Linney had worked with on four films, including “Kinsey.” “I knew Mindy would be able to come up with something a) the theater would be able to afford, b) that would look realistic and c) that I would be able to put on myself,” Linney said. Applying the extensive shrapnel marks to her face, arm and leg has become something of a pre-performance meditation for the actress. “I love the quiet time it gives me before every show,” she says. “I tend to get to the theater early anyway, but this gives me an excuse to get here even earlier. And you know, it’s just me alone. It becomes a sort of starting point.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/vain-glorious-a-scar-is-born/

If the recent surge of books about maps is any indication, cartographic art is for all ages. How better to visualize human history and keep track of one’s empire while contemplating opportunities for expansion? Andreas Gursky’s latest body of work pushes his penchant for wide-angle photography to encompass the ever-increasing scope of his Weltanschauung, or worldview. Verging on 13 feet by 8 feet, Gursky’s photographs are cinematic in scale, and their exhibition at Gagosian in Beverly Hills, Calif., is apt for a town filled with connoisseurs of cinematography (and movie moguls who can afford them).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/now-showing-the-world-according-to-gursky/

2010-03-10,The Dark Side of the Courtroom,"Had EMI paid closer attention to the skeptical lyrics of Pink Floyd’s “Have a Cigar”  not to mention the better part of that group’s back catalog  it might have known that the band is not endlessly trusting of record labels. Instead, EMI found out the hard way when Pink Floyd filed suit against the label in a dispute over how its online royalty payments and marketing costs for its music are calculated, Reuters reported. In a hearing at High Court in London on Tuesday, Robert Howe, a lawyer for Pink Floyd, said that a clause in the band’s contract “expressly prohibited” the “unbundling” of its songs in any configuration other than how they were originally produced and released. Mr. Howe said that EMI believed this “applies only to the physical product and doesn’t apply online,” adding that the argument “makes no commercial sense.” Pink Floyd first signed with EMI in the late 1960s, going on to record hit prog-rock albums like “The Dark Side of the Moon” and motivating the sale of millions of black light lamps and posters. The band more recently renegotiated its contract in the late 1990s, when online retailers like iTunes were still in their infancy. Reuters said that sales of Pink Floyd’s back catalog are exceeded only by another popular British combo: the Beatles.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/arts/music/10arts-THEDARKSIDEO_BRF.html

2010-03-10,Paging Mr. Herman!,"In his original 1985 review of ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure,"" Vincent Canby wrote that the film ""is the most barren comedy I've seen in years, maybe ever. It introduces motion picture audiences to a popular California comic named Pee-wee Herman, who seems to have put together his public personality by ransacking the wardrobes of his betters."" Mr. Canby goes on to add, ""Like Marcel Marceau, he appears to be physically slight and he often wears lipstick, but, unfortunately, he won't stop talking and  worse  laughing at his own gags. Like Jacques Tati, he wears pants that are too short, and like Jerry Lewis, he behaves as if he were a child trapped inside the body of a man. Like them all, he desperately wants to be funny but, unlike them, he isn't."" Well, many fans of Paul Reubens, who has recently begun to perform again in Los Angeles, may choose to disagree.

This week the company returns to the Joyce Theater for the first time in more than 15 years. Go especially to see ""Beach Birds"" (1991), which makes the program ""a must-see event; any chance now to see Cunningham's choreography seems precious, as his own company is in the early stages of its farewell international tour before disbanding in 2012. Soon, it seems, repertory ensembles like Lyon will be the main way in which we see Cunningham's miraculous dances live.""",UrbanEye,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/urbaneye/10ubn3-1.html

Head to places like the Bluebird Coffee Shop in the East Village, where ""the espresso is so plush and bright that it tastes sweet on its own"" or Third Rail Coffee in the West Village, which features ""elaborate designs in the cappuccino's foam.""

We are a quality manufacturer. My concern in life is, What does quality mean and how do you achieve it?” It’s a question that Dumas, 43, has been tackling all his life, though it was only in 2006 that he took over the creative reins of Hermès from his father, Jean-Louis. “I grew up in Hermès, so I always relate it to family and home, something that’s very natural and intimate,” Dumas says. “For me, Hermès is about the mystery and miracle of life.” More…",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/profile-in-style-pierre-alexis-dumas/

The film, which has actually never left theaters since it opened in a very few in June 2009, will open in an additional 35 on Friday, in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Washington D.C., Seattle, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis and San Diego, as well as in 30 more in Canada. That will take its total in North America to 348 theaters; for comparison’s sake, “Avatar” is playing in 2,163 theaters (although Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” has scooped up most of its 3-D screens), and “Crazy Heart” in 1,274. The distributors of “The Hurt Locker” decided on the modest expansion in order not to cannibalize DVD sales and rentals, where the best picture winner has already been doing well. It has sold 780,000 copies (including digital downloads), and since its release on Jan. 12, has landed in the Top 10 rental list each week.",Arts,https://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/an-oscar-bounce-for-hurt-locker/

I am slightly besotted with the women’s half of the collection. Instead of plaids, flannels and bike shorts, Massaroto (along with the sneaker designer Patrizio Carlucci) go instead for the skater/club kid/track-suits-from-the Salvation Army vibe of the grunge decade.

2010-03-11,Now Serving | The Art of Knödel,"Zipora Fried is not afraid of repetition. As an artist, she is best known for her large, labor-intensive abstract drawings, which she covers in silvery thickets of rapid pencil strokes. One drawing may take weeks to complete. Now she has turned her manual skills to making a dizzying array of dumplings. Unusual pastime, you say? Not for this Israel-born, Vienna-raised, New York-based artist who, after a well-received solo exhibition last year, decided to do something about her longing for food from Austria. A schnitzel’s throw from Schiller’s, her new cafe on Rivington Street is the perfect respite from early spring crowds.Since the heart of Kinski’s Czech-Austrian menu is the humble dumpling, or knödel, served up savory or sweet, it’s a pleasant surprise to see that it’s not about the same protagonist gussied up in various disguises. The sweet-cheese knödel, for instance, is made of soft farmer’s cheese (not unlike ricotta) that has been steamed and rolled in spiced bread crumbs. The apricot and the nougat knödel, although similar on the outside, reveal their respective sweet centers with a gentle slice of a fork. Toward the savory end of the spectrum, the finger-thick strands of the schupfnudeln are in essence billowy, pan-fried gnocchi with rosemary and a touch of lemon.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/now-serving-the-art-of-knodel/

Some new material, known as intake forms, collected by the center’s sexual assault response team were discovered this week. The discovery comes after last year’s revelation that the center had 3,000 videotapes of medical exams of children who were alleged victims of assault. The videotapes have already led to the release of a man  convicted earlier and have put other convictions at risk. An appellate court ruled two years ago that hospital examiners were part of the “prosecution team” and that the district attorney’s office was responsible for making sure evidence was turned over to defendants. “I’m sure they were dismayed at the discovery, and I’m glad to see they are jumping on it,” said the public defender, Mary Greenwood. “We hope and believe the defense perspective will be solicited about the value of what else they find.” [The San Jose Mercury News]",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/sampler-drug-cases-dismissed-in-san-francisco-and-can-a-big-house-be-green/

While the retro style might be pure brilliance by Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey, as some like Yahoo’s Jason King suggest, it was absolutely necessary, writes Stewart Mandel of SI.com, or everyone in Golden Dome land would still be fixating on scrubbing those messy footprints Charlie Weis left all over its football program.

Kennedy — the greatest champion of the view that health care is a right and the craftsman of the legislation that Brown eventually defeated — and taking a seat once held by Kennedy’s brother John F. Kennedy, whose chief published work was “Profiles in Courage,” a 1950s book that examines various senators who took courageous, principled positions and votes in opposition to their party.

These early dictionaries were filled only with “hard” words and did not bother with defining cow or apple, reasoning that everyone knew what words like that meant. Instead they sought to explain to the uninitiated the meaning of terms like desticate (to cry like a rat) and antipelargy (the reciprocal love children have for their parents).",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html

Though a popular Facebook campaign helped build Ms. White’s cause, Lorne Michaels, the “SNL” creator and executive producer, said Thursday that the grass-roots movement wasn’t the sole reason for the booking. “The depth of feeling for her at the show and particularly among the women who are coming back was very deep,” Mr. Michaels said in a telephone interview. He added that he had concerns given the show’s “grueling” schedule, and as a solution invited the former “SNL” performers Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon to appear, too. Ultimately, he said, Ms. White’s age wouldn’t prevent her from participating fully. “Mind you, at our show, Pardo’s 92,” he said, referring to the announcer Don Pardo. “A couple people in wardrobe are older than him.

The play, which will be written by Rupert Holmes (“Curtains,” “Drood”) and produced by the New York theater impresario Daryl Roth, will be adapted from Mr. Grisham’s 1989 novel, about murder, rape and racism in rural Mississippi, and not the 1996 film version directed by Joel Schumacher. “In the novel it’s possible to go to many different locations in the audience’s imagination,” said Molly Smith, the artistic director of Arena Stage, in a telephone interview on Thursday. Mr. Holmes’s adaptation, she said, is “very focused in the courtroom, and that will intensify the action of the entire piece, so that the audience really becomes the jurors, and at other points are voyeurs on the action.” It will run from May 6 through June 19, 2011.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/theater/12arts-THEHOURAPPRO_BRF.html

On March 12, 2006, United States soldiers were summoned to a small house in the heart of the insurgent-filled “Triangle of Death” south and west of Baghdad, where they discovered the charred remains of a 14-year-old girl who had been raped, shot to death, then burned with kerosene, along with the bodies of her 6-year-old sister and her parents. At first the killings were attributed to a feud between Iraqis, but after a soldier came forward with information he had gleaned from comrades, the Army arrested the real perpetrators: four soldiers from Bravo Company, a casualty-plagued unit in the Army’s First Battalion, 502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. Press attention centered on the group’s ringleader, Pvt. Steven Green from Midland, Tex., “a petulant loner and a hard-drinking druggie” according to Newsweek, who was afflicted by a “seething, seemingly random rage.” Despite Green’s repeated troubles with the law, he had easily enlisted in an Army hurting for recruits and breezed through basic training.

The situation underscores the paradox of charter-school oversight: The same freedoms that allow these schools to serve as laboratories of new educational practices also give them unusual financial and managerial latitude. The Alameda County school superintendent praised the school — its formal name is Families of Alameda for Multi-Cultural/Multi-Lingual Education — for providing a needed service for students. Nonetheless, the superintendent, Sheila Jordan, said in interviews that FAME’s executive director, Maram Alaiwat, might have engaged in inappropriate activities involving school finances.

2010-03-12,Start Your Engines,"Despite their 29-year age gap, Clark Gable and Steve McQueen had a few things in common — rural Midwestern upbringings, motorcycle obsessions, nicknames beginning with “King of” — but their cars weren’t one of them. Gable had a rather big, lavish 1935 Duesenberg JN with a boxy nose and external side pipes, while McQueen’s favored status symbol was a sleek 1957 Jaguar XK-SS Roadster, above. Blame World War II: “After the war, these little sporty European cars seemed much more appealing,” says Ronald Labaco, co-curator of “The Allure of the Automobile,” which opens March 21 at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. In addition to putting visitors within spitting distance of both stars’ former rides,the show traces the cultural and political influences on car design from the ’30s to the mid-’60s — considered the golden age of auto craftsmanship. Among the Mercedes-Benzes and Porsches that seemed ahead of their time, there are cars from long-defunct companies like Duesenberg and Tucker, which, despite their glamour, found themselves drowning under the excesses of bygone eras.

It was there, circa 1975, that the promoter Malcolm McLaren and the fashion visionary Vivienne Westwood transformed “four juvenile delinquents who had been caught on numerous occasions pilfering overpriced T-shirts” into the Sex Pistols.Thirty-five years on, the D.I.Y. iconography of underground music endures, so much so that the 200 vintage tees in “Ripped” — from acts like Gary Numan, Dead Kennedys, Talking Heads and Plasmatics — look oddly familiar, no doubt thanks to what the book calls “the onset of ironic consumerism.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/tee-time/

This novel, his fourth, gathers life greedily, hungrily, but with a certain stealth: Lee doesn’t bolt it all down at once, as the refugee children in his story do. “The Surrendered,” his largest, most ambitious book, is about the horrors of war and the sorrows of survival, yet its manner is quiet, watchful, expectant, as if everyone, including Lee himself, were waiting to see what might accrue.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/books/review/Rafferty-t.html

To fill the void above, Lee creates miniature upside-down interiors that he calls “parallel worlds,” placing them on domestic ceilings (on commission) and corporate offices (on the sly). “Decorating ceilings was a common art form that somehow got lost through the reductionism of modernism,” he says. The Lilliputian lairs are meticulously furnished with objects that tell a story about the “room” and its imaginary owner. One installation shows the apartment of a rocker, complete with a guitar, amp, microphone and Jimi Hendrix poster. Another, installed in a home with two small children, features a petit bourgeois living room with velvet sofas and tiny glass cabinets filled with strange furry objects made of cat hair. “The kids love it,” Lee says. “That’s the greatest compliment.” Go to pleaseenjoy.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/off-the-wall/

Now consider that all these elements might somehow be connected, might represent different aspects of some giant whatsit that will eventually constitute the cultural face of our time in the eyes of the future. That is what David Shields proposes in “Reality Hunger: A Manifesto.” He further argues that what all those things have in common is that they express or fulfill a need for reality, a need that is not being met by the old and crumbling models of literature.

But the good guys, those their contemporaries saw as heroes or saints, often puzzle and appall. They did the cruelest things for the loftiest of motives; they sang hymns as they waded through blood. Nowhere, perhaps, is this contradiction more apparent than in the history of the Crusades. When the victorious knights of the First Crusade finally stood in Jerusalem, on July 15, 1099, they were, in the words of the chronicler William of Tyre, “dripping with blood from head to foot.” They had massacred the populace.

Composed in 1868 as a five-act French grand opera with all the trimmings and not seen at the Met since 1897, “Hamlet” invariably seems to get bad press, especially in Anglo-Saxon countries. “Pretentious and wearisome,” summed up a critic for The New York Times after the Met premiere in 1884. “We’ve always known that something was rotten in the state of Denmark,” snarled the British critic Edward Seckerson after seeing a revival of the opera at Covent Garden in 2003, “and now we know what it is.” Perhaps the most devastating brushoff came from the French music historian E. Destranges, who, on the occasion of the composer’s centenary in 1911, sniffed that Thomas had done little more than “deposit” music on Shakespeare.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/arts/music/14hamlet.html

2010-03-15,Problems for New Orleans Art Show,"Prospect, the New Orleans art biennial that began in 2008 (which included Mark Bradford’s “Mithra”), winning critical praise and generating millions in tourist income for its hurricane-battered home, has become entangled in fund-raising and administrative problems that are jeopardizing its future, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported Thursday. The ambitious event, which installed the work of more than 80 artists at sites throughout New Orleans, ended up badly over budget after the bills came due in 2008, owing more than $1 million more than it had raised. Late last month, its founding director, Dan Cameron, announced that the next iteration of the event, Prospect.2, would be postponed until the fall of 2011 from this November because of fund-raising shortfalls. The Times-Picayune reported that several directors who joined the biennial’s board in 2009 to help shore up the finances and raise money for Prospect.2, stepped down in February because of differences with Mr. Cameron over how the project should be managed. Two people with knowledge of the board resignations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, confirmed the basic account of the problems to The New York Times. The Times-Picayune reported that the biennial’s executive director, Barbara Motley, a theater owner who was hired last year to oversee the administrative side of the event so that Mr. Cameron could focus on selecting artists and helping them to realize their works, had also resigned. Ms. Motley told the newspaper that she believed in “organizational charts and management protocols” while Mr. Cameron was “much more organic in his approach to management.”Earlier this month the Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans announced that it would not renew Mr. Cameron’s contract as its part-time visual arts director. The center’s director said it needed someone to work full-time to oversee its art exhibitions. Mr. Cameron did not respond to telephone and e-mail messages left for him today.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/arts/design/13arts-PROBLEMSFORN_BRF.html

It will be directed by Sheldon Epps with a book by Suzan-Lori Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of “Topdog/Underdog.” The musical, which had a developmental production at Pasadena Playhouse under the title “Ray Charles Live!” in 2007, imagines Charles, at his last live recording session, where stories from his life pour out and mix with his best-known hits that will be featured in the show. A spokeswoman for the production said that “Unchain My Heart” represents the first musical book-writing effort by Ms. Parks, whose plays also include “Venus,” “In the Blood” and her newest, “The Book of Grace,” which is now in preview performances at the Public Theater. Mr. Benjamin, who worked with Charles for years and produced the Academy Award-winning film “Ray,” said the production would run at a Shubert Organization theater to be announced later.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/theater/13arts-RAYCHARLESMU_BRF.html

An executive involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss tour plans, said the producers had been mulling a national tour for months and lined up “some great actors” for the possible production. (The executive declined to name them.) While some theaters nationally were considering a “Carnage” tour for a spot in their 2010-11 subscription seasons, the producers decided that not enough theaters in major cities would be available for a tour that would need to last at least 26 weeks to make the show profitable. Instead, once “Carnage” closes on Broadway  it opened on March 22, 2009, and is running indefinitely  the play will probably be licensed to regional theaters that can then mount their own productions.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/theater/13arts-NOTOACARNAGE_BRF.html

The government collapsed in February when the Labor Party quit the governing coalition over the continued Dutch military presence in Afghanistan. The 2,000 Dutch soldiers, part of the NATO contingent fighting the war, were scheduled to return home at the end of the year, but after entreaties from the United States, the leading Christian Democrats tried to extend the Dutch military presence. A long cabinet debate prompted the left-of-center Labor Party to walk out, necessitating new elections. Under Mr. Cohen, the Labor Party hopes to regain ground and win enough votes to form the next government. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/world/europe/13briefs-dutch.html

And right now, you’re driving drunk. You think you can embarrass your only true ally in the world, to satisfy some domestic political need, with no consequences?

Greedy and heedless, Wall Street firms had been turning subprime mortgages  loans made to people with low creditworthiness or little documentation  into exotic, toxic financial products that they made a fortune laundering and reselling, and they were enabled in doing so by the very ratings agencies that were supposed to police risk.

Only about 10 minutes of film could be added, though, to keep under the 170-minute maximum length a movie can be released in analog Imax theaters. But that is just the amount Mr. Cameron has said he could easily push through postproduction for a director’s cut or for the DVD release, including a scene in which Jake Sully further proves himself to the Na’vi people, and another surrounding a native festival. “Avatar” was taken out of 3-D theaters to make way for the opening of Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland.” At a demonstration of 3-D TV in New York last week, Mr. Cameron told USA Today, “The word we’re getting back from exhibitors is we probably left a couple hundred million dollars on the table as a result.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/movies/15arts-RELEASEANDRE_BRF.html

2010-03-15,The Originals | Gary Card,"“I had a lot of fun with child kidnapping,” says the set designer, illustrator and T contributor Gary Card, speaking of his recent campaign for Comme des Garçons that involved adapting dark Victorian children’s stories. “And people turning into horses and slugs and things — that got my imagination ticking.” The London-based Card, 28, covers the High Street with clients that include Liberty, Stella McCartney, Adidas, Hermès and Top Shop. “What I love about my job is I have the opportunity to make both art and commercial products, and something else that can be a little bit stranger and more off-beat,” he says. In a recent foray into fine art at the London gallery Spring Projects, he exhibited “a gigantic cave made out of white Plasticine, which was then sculpted into 3,000 tiny heads…so you walked through this strange vortex of little white faces staring at you.” In appearance, Card suggests a cross between David Hockney and the British avant-garde pop star Patrick Wolf. But the creative chameleon, who wants to design furniture next, shrugs off the comparison. “My personal style is whatever I find on the floor, really.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/the-originals-gary-card/

Somehow those influences come out in his designs as unisex garments made from soft jersey fabric that practically snuggle with the body. “My work is utilitarian,” he says. “Anyone can put it on, female or male, and everything is adjustable so you can tie it in a different way for a different body type.” Clemens’s signature line, as well as his diffusion range, Un.Der T, are available in downtown boutiques and will soon be sold on telfar.net. Coming up for the man who gave the world a two-piece unisex swimsuit? “I’ve always been into sportswear, but I really want to incorporate sportswear with formal wear this season.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/the-originals-telfar-clemens/

2010-03-15,When Hollywood Gets It Right,"Since my column today uses the release of Paul Greengrass’s “Green Zone” as an occasion to complain about how Hollywood can’t seem to capture the complexities and ironies of real-world politics, it seems worthwhile to mention a few recent exceptions to this rule. This will be a short list: Stephen Frears’ “The Queen” is on it, so is Alexander Payne’s “Election” (yes, it takes place in a high school — what’s your point?), and so is the portrait of Baltimore’s mayoral politics on David Simon’s “The Wire.” (The character of Clarence Royce, the compromised incumbent, is a particularly good example of how a storyteller can be fair to a fundamentally unsympathetic figure.) David O. Russell’s great “Three Kings” doesn’t feature any politicians, but it captures the tragic ironies of our involvement in Iraq with more clarity and sensitivity than any of the movies made about the second Gulf War. Neither Oliver Stone’s “Nixon” nor Mike Nichols’ “Primary Colors” are particularly successful movies, but both make a good-faith effort to portray polarizing figures from our recent past in shades of gray, rather than just black and white. (About the rest of Stone’s forays into political subjects, the less said the better.) And one of the reasons so many people praised — and overpraised — the political themes in “The Dark Knight,” I suspect, is that even an attempt at political ambiguity (and in a superhero movie, no less) seemed impressive, given how rarely Hollywood goes in for anything save caricature.",Blogs,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/when-hollywood-gets-it-right/

2010-03-16,Shakespeare Canon: New Ammunition?,"An assertion by a professor at the University of Nottingham in England that he has found proof that a play from the 1700s includes reworked material of Shakespeare’s has gained a qualified endorsement from the Arden Shakespeare, a scholarly anthology of his work. The university said on Monday that a new edition of the play, “Double Falsehood, or the Distressed Lovers” by Lewis Theobald, an 18th-century scholar and Shakespeare editor, would be published on March 22 as part of Arden’s Third Series of Shakespeare’s works. Theobald had said the play was based on three lost Shakespeare texts, a contentious claim that may now be backed up by the work of Brean Hammond, a professor of modern English literature at Nottingham. In his book, also called “Double Falsehood,” Mr. Hammond says he has found evidence linking that play to “Cardenio,” a lost collaboration between Shakespeare and John Fletcher that was performed in 1613. Richard Proudfoot, general editor of the Arden Shakespeare, said in a statement that “the inclusion of ‘Double Falsehood’ is our most controversial decision.” He added, “That it represents in some form the otherwise lost play of ‘Cardenio,’ by Fletcher and Shakespeare, is a sufficiently sustainable position to recommend publication in Arden 3 of Lewis Theobald’s avowedly thorough 18th-century adaptation, thus making it accessible for the first time in 250 years.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/books/16arts-NEWAMMUNITIO_BRF.html

If you merely took part in the murder, at least you got a nice souvenir. On Monday  the Ides of March, naturally  the British Museum in London put on display a gold coin given to one of Caesar’s assassins that may have been worn as a memento by the boastful killer, The Guardian reported. The coin, above, which was struck soon after Caesar’s murder in 44 B.C., depicts on one side the head of Brutus, and on the other, two daggers and the hat of a freeman, a symbol of the conspirators’ belief in the Roman republic instead of the tyranny that Caesar represented to them. The Guardian said that about 60 silver versions of the coin survive, but only 2 gold ones were believed to still exist  one of which is now believed by experts to be a fake.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/arts/design/16arts-ASOUVENIROFC_BRF.html

Peirce. Pragmatism may or may not be an ethical program depending on whose version you are reading, but it always emphasizes the resources of historically given institutions and practices and de-emphasizes the role played in our lives by supra-historical essentialisms (God, faith, truth, reason, brute fact, overarching theory) even to the extent sometimes of denying their existence.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/pragmatisms-gift/

But before he was a celebrity presiding over a hit reality show and restaurants in New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, he was a cook. ""And at Colicchio & Sons,"" Sam Sifton writes, ""He is running his kitchen at a level that New Yorkers have not been able to experience since his days at the helm of Gramercy Tavern, the restaurant he opened with Danny Meyer in 1994. For the moment, anyway, Mr. Colicchio's is the must-try New York menu. His restaurant isn't perfect. But it is exciting. And the food is terrifically good."" Mr. Sifton suggests ordering the tasting menu, which features sophisticated composed plates.

He and Mauricio Paniagua, known for trippy creations like their three-foot-tall table in the shape of a grasshopper, conceived the series as homage to Fornasetti while introducing the world to their hometown heroes. The rest of the cast includes the poet Pita Amor, the architect Luis Barragán (left) and — the lookers of the bunch — the actors Andrés García and Verónica Castro.

The forthcoming book “Buildings Without Architects” (Rizzoli; $23) presents them all as works of grassroots ingenuity. Written by John May, who authored the official history of Greenpeace, the book pegs modish keywords like “energy-efficient” and “sustainable” to ancient buildings, most of which were made of stuff that’s been around since prehistoric times: wood, reed, earth and clay.

2010-03-17,The HBO Auteur,"It was a bright, warm, blue-skied December afternoon in Central City, New Orleans, and in this neighborhood of humble shotgun houses and overgrown empty lots, a convoy of white trucks and trailers idled incongruously while unmarked police cars blocked intersections nearby. On any other morning, a police presence would have meant more bad news: in a city that has one of the highest homicide rates in the United States, this neighborhood — roughly a mile from the French Quarter — has a murder rate that, in recent years, has hit quadruple that of the city as a whole. This morning, however, the 20 drivers, as well as 80 other crew members who hefted and humped a boggling array of gear at the tumbledown corner of Second Street and South Liberty, had anything but murder in mind: they were six hours into a day of filming the third episode of “Treme,” David Simon’s new HBO drama — co-created by the seasoned television writer and producer Eric Overmyer — which is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and will make its debut on April 11. The production was only two scenes into the six on the call sheet; at that pace, they were looking at a 15-hour marathon — yet another in the 11-day ultramarathon that shooting an hour of episodic television on location can demand. As the novelist George Pelecanos, a staff writer on “Treme,” told me of the years he spent on set as a writer-producer on “The Wire,” Simon’s breakthrough series: “If you got out with a 12-hour day, that was the luckiest day of the series. Try doing that for seven months straight. Only young people can do it.

2010-03-17,The System (Sort of) Works,"Obviously the health care endgame has become a pretty ugly business, but having dissented from the liberal anguish over our “broken government” when the threat of the filibuster was forcing supporters of health care reform to count to 60 in the Senate, allow me to dissent as well from the conservative dyspepsia over the Democratic Party’s “unprecedented” use of various parliamentary maneuvers (today, reconciliation; tomorrow, “deem and pass”; the day after that, “blue steel”) to get the House and Senate bills reconciled and through. I think it’s a good thing that the countermajoritarian customs of the Senate, as adapted by the minority for a more ideological age, have made it very difficult to pass a sweeping overhaul of America’s de facto constitution. But I also think it’s appropriate that there exists, for an extremely determined but not-quite-super majority, mechanisms that allow legislators to overcome these hurdles and push a controversial piece of legislation through. “Hard but not absolutely impossible” seems like the right bar to set for a bill of this nature. I wish the Democrats had chosen a different path, but in the end, we live in a republic, not a direct democracy: If our elected representatives can really muster enough votes, within the rules, to pass health care legislation even after everything that’s happened — if they believe that strongly, in other words, that this is absolutely and without question the right policy for America — then they have every right to go for it. It may be their funeral, but it’s certainly their prerogative.",Blogs,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/the-system-sort-of-works/

Christie’s was to have sold the painting in New York in November 2006 to benefit the foundation, but it was forced to withdraw it 24 hours before the auction after the collector Julius H. Schoeps filed a lawsuit saying that it had been forcibly sold by his great-uncle, Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, a Jewish banker in Berlin.

2010-03-18,Theater Talkback: The Accent’s the Thing,"LONDON — It’s only when you come to this city and hear British actors playing Americans that you realize how funny we all talk. I’m kidding, of course, but after listening to the peculiar nasality of some of the accents in the Old Vic revival of John Guare’s “Six Degrees of Separation,” I found myself wondering whether the twang-free voice I’d always assumed I’d been speaking in sounded so very peculiar to the British. I’ve been working on something grander-sounding and mid-Atlantic ever since.Accents can cause unusual problems for actors. First-class training doesn’t necessarily instill the ability to master different voices; it’s a particular aptitude that comes more naturally to some than others. I adored Patti LuPone’s darkly funny performance as Mrs. Lovett in the recent Broadway revival of “Sweeney Todd,” but I have never before heard an Englishwoman of any class or period – fictional or otherwise — speaking with quite the same quirky intonations. (Video of Ms. LuPone and the rest of the cast of the Broadway revival of “Sweeney Todd” is here.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/theater-talkback-with-charles-isherwood-the-accents-the-thing/

As the Germans begin liquidating the city’s Jewish population, Julia, a pharmacist whose husband has already been sent to a labor camp, smuggles her 11-year-old son, Hugo, out of the ghetto. Their journey through the sewer pipes leads them to a house on the outskirts of town, where Julia entrusts Hugo to the care of an old friend, Mariana, before taking flight herself. Mariana, as Hugo will discover, is a prostitute, while the house — known simply as “the Residence” — is a brothel catering to the Nazi occupiers. For the next year and a half, Hugo’s world will contract to the bedroom in which Mariana cossets, neglects and ultimately seduces him, and the closet in which he hides when her clients come knocking.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/books/review/Leavitt-t.html

2010-03-18,At Close Range,"For the last 45 years, John McPhee has come out with a work of narrative nonfiction about every year and a half. The quantity impresses, but not nearly so much as the quality.

We envy his powers of description, the way he transforms technically complex subjects into something readers can hold in their hand and examine at close range. And, perhaps above all else, we marvel at the pains he takes with structure, approaching his subject from oblique angles, slowly building tension, sometimes seeming to wander, but always propelling his narratives forward.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/books/review/Royte-t.html

A writer is running, clutching the manuscript of a book that refuses to be written, toward the Black Gate of Tokyo, where something of an occult nature is going on. Both the reader and the fictional writer — is it David Peace himself? — are tightly wound in something intensely claustrophobic.

2010-03-18,"Trust, Underwater","In 2004, newly married and having decided to embark on the next phase of adulthood, my wife and I bought a house. This was back in the delirious days of multiple offers and outlandish escalation clauses, when you had to bring your checkbook with you to an open house, just in case someone else tried to buy the place while you were poking around the attic. I called a mortgage broker somewhere in Florida, and she was thrilled to hear from me, practically breathless. I felt as if I were the 10,000th customer to come through line at the Safeway, my arrival heralded by streamers and sirens and all kinds of free stuff falling from the rafters. Did we want a five-year adjustable-rate loan or maybe even rates adjusted on a monthly basis? Why not just pay just the interest rather than the principal? Did we also need a bridge loan for a few months, to hold us over from one house to the next? How about a ‘‘second trust'' — that is, two mortgages instead of one — so we could put less money down, maybe even as little as 5 percent of the purchase price while avoiding the penalty of private mortgage insurance? We might as well open a home equity line of credit on top of the mortgage, she said, so we could borrow another six-figure sum with the tear of a perforated check. Countrywide, the nation's largest lender, would happily give us that free, and, hey, you never knew when you might decide to add a skylight over the kitchen, or maybe a stone turret.",Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/realestate/keymagazine/21trust-t.html

And so begins “What We Are,” Peter Nathaniel Malae’s first novel, with twofold irony: First, Paul’s father is a Samoan immigrant, which, in this story, inoculates his son against cultural prejudice. Second, in 2006 immigration reform was largely about paths to United States citizenship for illegals, the assumption being that they wanted to stay. Not so much Paul. He is a first-­generation American who lives in a country he cannot stand, and spends much of his time railing against everyone in it, himself included. One of this novel’s organizing tensions is how to reconcile misanthropy with a sense that taking a stand — for people, for values — can suffuse your life with meaning. For Paul, whose heritage is mixed, there is the added problem of how to straddle cultures while still forging an identity of his own. From Page 1, his biggest gripe is that he has no story, no position and, more worrisome, no heart. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/books/review/Maazel-t.html

The joy of cooking was certainly the salve that soothed the emotional wounds that the journalist Paula Butturini endured as she and her husband suffered bullets, police beatings and a battle with depression that almost tore their marriage apart. Butturini tells her story through the lens of food — its restorative powers and its capacity to trigger the brain to remember and hope in times of tragedy and challenge: “And like a potter centering clay on a spinning potter’s wheel, the mere act of cooking centered me,” Butturini writes in “Keeping the Feast,” her blunt and brave memoir. It “kept me close, available, ready to help, kept us fed, kept me sufficiently focused on present tasks so that I wouldn’t panic about the future, kept me going through the slow passing of a string of bad days, weeks and months.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/books/review/Brzezinski-t.html

Like much of Italy, Dalser abandoned herself to him body and soul. The film’s title  a reference to a popular Italian Fascist song  means to win, as in to defeat, vanquish, surpass. “Win, win, win!” Fascist soldiers would sing, as Il Duce aroused the populace. “At any cost!” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/movies/19vincere.html

Winnowed to pure, hardy quartz, the sediment moved with the gulf’s currents and gathered into the necklace of narrow barrier islands that buffer Florida’s Panhandle. Time and tides refined the sand into a soft, sun-bleached powder. By the 1830s, when a Yankee sea captain named Leonard Destin sailed down to the wilderness of the Florida Territory, he discovered beaches as dazzling and white as a fresh blanket of snow. The sight evidently impressed the captain, for his reaction — like that of so many migrants who followed — was to claim a piece of the shore. Destin landed, built a New England Colonial-style house and started a fishing business, becoming the first recorded white settler in the beach town that now bears his name.",Real Estate,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/realestate/keymagazine/21KeyBeachfront-t.html

She is stepping in for Anna Netrebko, who is ill, the Met said. Ms. Gheorghiu, the Romanian soprano, withdrew from the Met’s Richard Eyre-directed production of “Carmen” amid marital problems with her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, who starred in that opera; she said last month in a statement that she wanted “to be as prepared dramatically as I am musically” for the production. But there is evidently no bad blood between her and the Met; Ms. Gheorghiu is currently rehearsing for its coming production of “La Traviata,” which opens on March 29, and will sing the role of Juliette in Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette” for the Met’s 2010-11 season.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/gheorghiu-to-cover-for-netrebko-in-saturdays-la-boheme/

2010-03-22,This Way There Be Dragons,"AT first glance “How to Train Your Dragon,” the new action-adventure film from DreamWorks Animation based on the whimsical children’s book by Cressida Cowell, does not seem to share much with the Coen brothers’ “No Country for Old Men” or M. Night Shyamalan’s “Village.” But a closer look reveals some similarities. From washed-out landscapes to minimally lighted rooms, the Nordic locations in “Dragon” feel more lived in and rough edged  more realistic  than one typically finds in animation. This comes from the influence of an outsider, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins. Best known for his work on “A Beautiful Mind,” “The Shawshank Redemption” and Coen brothers’ films, Mr. Deakins had little experience working in animation, save for some consulting on “Wall-E.” But as the co-directors of “Dragon,” Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (“Lilo & Stitch”), were thinking of a way to distinguish their film from other animated work, they decided to bring in someone who could see light in a different way. Below Mr. Deakins, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders discuss how they achieved the film’s look. ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/movies/21dragon.html

Last week, Marie Force, the archivist at the Delta Heritage Museum in Atlanta, published an online gallery of photographs of Delta flight attendant uniforms from 1940 to the present. “Delta was one of the more conservative airlines,” Force says. “We didn’t have hot pants.” Still, for almost 40 straight years, the airline’s female flight attendants (something called “stewardesses”) turned heads. In the 1940s, they did it with military-style overseas caps and spectator shoes; in the ’50s, with futurist insignias and stiletto pumps; and in the ’60s, with A-line topcoats, alligator-print boots, Chanel-inspired jackets with three-quarter-length sleeves and the “Delberet,” a pillbox hat designed for Delta by Mea Hanauer, a New York milliner. The ’70s were all about coo-coo colors, bell-bottom pants, Slavic tunics and, weirdly, a yellow raincoat. And then in the ’80s, Delta took a sartorial nosedive that it couldn’t recover from until 2001.

Berg, after all, was Schoenberg’s disciple, and his concerto combines Schoenberg’s 12-tone method with a current of Romanticism that ties it to the Brahms. In the Brahms itself, the music’s 19th-century harmonies are tempered by Schoenberg’s overtly modernist brass and percussion touches. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/arts/music/20phil.html

2010-03-22,"Antiquities, Once the Met’s, Go on Display in Rome","Sixteen Hellenistic silver-gilt objects once showcased at the Metropolitan Museum of Art had their official Italian debut on Friday at the National Museum of Rome. The pieces, including the one below, are thought to have been looted some 30 years ago from the archaeological site at the ancient Greek colony of Morgantina (modern day Aidone, in eastern Sicily) and were returned to Italy as part of a 2006 agreement between the government and the Met. In recent years Italy has signed similar accords with other American institutions, and archaeologists at Friday’s presentation praised such restitutions as indicative of a cultural sea change that recognizes that “archaeology is context,” according to Malcolm Bell III, a professor at the University of Virginia who helped establish the provenance of the objects, which led to their return. In 1981 and 1982 the Met bought the silver hoard from the American dealer Robert Hecht for $2.74 million. Mr. Hecht is currently standing trial in Rome on charges of conspiracy to traffic in looted artifacts.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/arts/20arts-ANTIQUITIESO_BRF.html

She is stepping in for Anna Netrebko, who is ill, the Met said. Ms. Gheorghiu, the Romanian soprano, withdrew from the Met’s Richard Eyre-directed production of “Carmen” amid marital problems with her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, who starred in that opera; she said last month in a statement that she wanted “to be as prepared dramatically as I am musically” for the production. But there is evidently no bad blood between her and the Met; Ms. Gheorghiu is currently rehearsing for its coming production of “La Traviata,” which opens on March 29, and will sing the role of Juliette in Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette” for the Met’s 2010-11 season.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/arts/music/20arts-GHEORGHIUINL_BRF.html

Antonia Markiet, a senior executive editor at the imprint, said the new book “will contain between 120 and 130 poems” by Mr. Silverstein, none of which have been published. Ms. Markiet is among the editors who began working with Mr. Silverstein, who died in 1999, in the 1970s (when he was still better known as a writer of songs like “A Boy Named Sue” and an illustrator of Playboy cartoons that would never find their way into a children’s anthology), and previously edited the author’s posthumously published 2005 children’s book “Runny Babbit.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/books/20arts-MORESILVERST_BRF.html

In a letter written to Partridge on April 3, 1941, shortly after Woolf’s disappearance, Clive Bell, the husband of Woolf’s sister, Vanessa, wrote: “I’m afraid there is not the slightest doubt that she drowned herself about noon last Friday. She had left letters for Leonard and Vanessa,” referring to Woolf’s husband, Leonard Woolf. He added: “For some days, of course, we hoped against hope that she had wandered crazily away and might be discovered in a barn or a village shop. But by now all hope is abandoned.” The collection includes thousands of pages of letters, including some from Woolf, and 30 albums of photographs featuring members of the group of intellectuals at Cambridge that included Lehmann, Partridge, E. M. Forster, and others, and has been acquired by King’s College.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/books/22arts-ANEWLIGHTONW_BRF.html

And even though that spot was declared, in another context, by a different King Arthur, to be “a silly place,” that kingdom and its knights are now set to make a serious return on television. On Monday, the Starz cable channel said that it was preparing a new series called “Camelot,” based on the version of the Arthurian legend recounted in Thomas Malory’s “Morte d’Arthur.” Starz, which has recently found a hit in its sword-and-sandals adventure series “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” said “Camelot” will be written by Chris Chibnall, of the supernatural British dramas “Life on Mars” and “Torchwood,” and produced by a team that includes Graham King (“The Departed,” “Gangs of New York”) and Morgan O’Sullivan and Michael Hirst (both of the Showtime period drama “The Tudors”). The 10-episode series is expected to begin production in June with episodes to start showing in 2011. No cast was announced — Starz said in a statement that it was seeking “fresh talent combined with established faces” — and no word if this “Camelot” will feature musical numbers with “footwork impeccable.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/starz-seeks-starry-knights-for-camelot/

2010-03-23,Theater to Be Named in Honor of Sondheim,"After five decades of critically acclaimed work on Broadway, the composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, below, is receiving a rare laurel and one of the few that had not yet come his way: his name on a Broadway theater. At a gala performance on Monday night of the new Broadway musical “Sondheim on Sondheim,” the director James Lapine and the musical book writer John Weidman were to announce that Henry Miller’s Theater, which re-opened on Broadway last fall after a nearly complete overhaul, would be renamed the Stephen Sondheim Theater. According to a statement by Mr. Lapine and Mr. Weidman, a small group of “Stephen Sondheim devotees” contributed to the Roundabout Theater Company’s musical production fund to rededicate the theater in Mr. Sondheim’s honor. (Neither a list of donors nor the precise sum was disclosed.) Roundabout has a long-term lease to operate and oversee programming for this 1,055-seat theater, on West 43rd Street between Broadway and Avenue of the Americas. Roundabout has produced several of Mr. Sondheim’s works, including “Assassins” and “Pacific Overtures.” Mr. Sondheim, who turned 80 on Monday, has won an Academy Award, several Tony and Grammy awards, and the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/theater/23arts-THEATERTOBEN_BRF.html

The fact that he had been involved in a financial scandal that cost his Tory father his seat as a member of Parliament made the tabloids apt to pay attention: London’s Evening Standard gave the picture its front page. But as Conway, 27, himself observed in a different context in his fashion column for SuperSuper magazine, “Where there’s muck, there’s brass.” After dark, the event promoter socializes with the likes of Princes William and Harry at his Thursday-night wheeze at Mayfair’s hip Mahiki Club. And he will soon debut a Friday party cheekily called Royal Jelly at Bungalow 8. He is also the co-author of a book on the history of knitwear and appears as a fashion expert on highbrow arts programs like the BBC’s “Newsnight Review.” “I am a slightly old-school cultural commentator,” Conway says over the phone from London, not before mentioning he’s just had an appointment with “Victoria Beckham’s facialist.” But he doesn’t see a conflict between his roles as budding public intellectual and private party host. “I think you do have to experience life to be able to judge it and pass judgment on it.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/the-originals-henry-conway/

The board that oversees the station, which operates as part of a nonprofit organization, had been studying possible changes for a couple of years. The move continues a decade-long trend among classical stations. Last year, WQXR in New York and WCRB in Boston were sold to public radio operators. (WQXR was sold by The New York Times Company.) Besides KING-FM, there are only 18 commercial classical radio stations in the United States. Marc Hand, an industry consultant at Public Radio Capital, said classical stations tended to have older listeners than other formats; those listeners, he said, were less appealing to advertisers but more apt to be the kind of dedicated, passionate supporters who give money to public radio. “I think this move really makes for a station that’s more economically viable,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/arts/music/24arts-CLASSICALMUS_BRF.html
2010-03-24,The Supersizing of the Last Supper,"How far back should a study go to show that food portions have increased over time? Ten years? Fifty years? What about all the way back to the Last Supper? A new article in The International Journal of Obesity doesn’t turn the clock back quite that far but looks at nearly a thousand years’ worth of paintings depicting the meal and concludes that the sizes of portions, plates and bread “increased dramatically” over those years. The study, conducted by two brothers  Brian Wansink, a professor of consumer behavior at Cornell and director of the school’s Food and Brand Lab; and Craig Wansink, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Wesleyan College  looks at 52 Last Supper paintings made between about 1000 and 1800, including famous depictions by Leonardo (detail, above), Titian and El Greco. After the size of the food in the artworks was indexed against the average size of the disciples’ heads (which can vary from painting to painting), the study found that the main courses grew by 69 percent, the plates by 66 percent and the bread by 23 percent. The authors are careful to qualify what these findings mean. “We can say that plates and the amounts grow in the paintings,” Craig Wansink said on Tuesday in a telephone interview. “Does that mean in terms of the actual culture and time that food itself increased? I don’t think we have the social and historical data to back that up. But we do have the data to show that food took on increasing prominence.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/arts/design/24arts-THESUPERSIZI_BRF.html
2010-03-24,Two Fewer Episodes of ‘Two and a Half Men’,"The CBS comedy “Two and a Half Men” will produce two fewer episodes because of Charlie Sheen’s stint at a rehabilitation center, the program’s executive producer, Chuck Lorre, said. Warner Brothers Television, which produces “Two and a Half Men,” said the series resumed production last week. In late February Mr. Sheen, one of the show’s stars, entered rehab in what his spokesman called a “preventative measure.” In an interview on Monday, Mr. Lorre said: “Instead of doing 24 shows this year, we’ll be doing 22. But 22 is a full order. They had asked us to produce two additional episodes, which we normally do. But we won’t do it this year.” Mr. Sheen pleaded not guilty last week to charges of domestic violence stemming from a dispute with his wife and is scheduled to be tried in July.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/arts/television/24arts-TWOFEWEREPIS_BRF.html

Eddy Arnold  not Eddie  was the singer who recorded one of many versions of “The Ballad of Davy Crockett,” the theme from a series of episodes of the television show “Disneyland” in which Mr. Parker starred in the 1950s. And a line from that song should have read: “Raised in the woods so’s he knew ev’ry tree”  not “Raised in the woods so he knew every tree.”",Obituaries,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/obituaries/24corrections-08.html

Now, the former doctor, Jeffrey MacDonald, who is serving three life terms, is requesting a new trial based on new DNA evidence and affidavits from witnesses who say they heard others confess to the crimes. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, will hear arguments on March 30. Mr. MacDonald, 66, has maintained that hippies who were high on drugs killed his family. His lawyers, who have been receiving legal assistance from the Innocence Project, said Tuesday that DNA showed that he was not the source of hairs found at the scene. Prosecutors argue that the DNA should not be admitted. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/us/24brfs-NEWTRIALSOUG_BRF.html

The audit documented 398 accusations, most decades old, about 286 offenders. The church says it spent about $104 million in connection with the abuse scandal in 2009.

Some prisoners may be released early for completing drug or education programs. Part of the plan includes changing how the state handles parolees, many of whom, at the moment, return to prison on technical violations, according to criminal system experts. California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, but now hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from their parole officers. The effort represents a “seismic shift,” said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the state’s prisons.

It’s basically a list of reference-laden responses to the many assertions made by one or another of the variegated camps rejecting the need for action to curb greenhouse gases. There is a conventional blog stream covering developments as they occur. But most useful, perhaps, in a world of information overload, is the basic litany of 101 (and counting) skeptics’ arguments and responses.

(And that’s without getting into the tangled issue of community health centers.)

(I also was excited to see the piece on Brunello Cucinelli; interesting business, with annual sales of more than $200 million, reports RebeccaMead, and I know a lot of women who like the clothes, expensive though they are. But I was bored reading about him.) One thing in the Polyvore piece that amused me was the description of the company’s office, the atmosphere of tact and friendliness — unlike magazine offices which, as Ms. Jacobs noted, “are widely perceived to be snake pits.” But looking at clothes and brands and trends on a computer screen is a different experience, isn’t it? Magazines are diva pits, flesh-and-blood places, and they are probably less so today than 10 or 20 years ago, and of course that outsized feeling and passion for clothes is what helps stir the imagination of designers and editors alike. I guess things are thinning out now, and not just magazine pages.

It is the first time that a gospel album has been in the Top 10 since November 2008, when “The Sound” from Mary Mary reached No. 7, according to Billboard. It credits the sleeper radio success of Mr. Sapp’s 2007 song “Never Would Have Made It” with the new album’s sales. (“Thirsty,” the album that contained “Never Would Have Made It,” peaked at No. 28.)Also on this week’s chart, Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” (Capitol Nashville) returns to No. 1 for a fourth time with sales of 93,000, bringing its eight-week total to just under 1.5 million.

On Tuesday Britain’s National Heritage Memorial Fund gave a grant of £1.285 million (about $1.9 million) to two museums that will keep the treasure, having raised a total of £3.3 million (about $4.9 million) to keep the collection intact, The Guardian reported. The Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent museums will pay that money to Mr. Herbert and Fred Johnson, the farmer in whose field the hoard was found, having raised donations from around the world in a campaign that began in January. David Starkey, the historian who started the fund-raising campaign, told The Guardian, “This is by far the most important archaeological discovery in Britain since the Second World War.” He added, “Frankly they’d have been demented not to give the money.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/grant-ensures-anglo-saxon-treasure-will-go-to-museums/

What composers and theater producers came up with is a curious compromise that Roger North, a writer at the time, called “semi-opera.” In this hybrid form, a play is presented straightforwardly, as spoken text, with masques  parades of songs, choruses and dance  interspersed within each act. The masques are an alternative universe: often, the play unfolds in the real world and the masques in the realm of the supernatural. And though the play’s actors might remain as observers, they cede the stage to the singers and dancers and rarely interact with them. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/arts/music/25fairy.html

That is what Scott Braun, the manager of the 16-year-old singer Justin Bieber, below, discovered on Wednesday when he was arrested on charges stemming from a November event at which Mr. Bieber’s fans stampeded during his appearance at a mall in Garden City, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. At that time the police told Mr. Braun to send out a message on Twitter saying the event was canceled. A lawyer for Mr. Braun said he sent two tweets in seven minutes, but prosecutors say it took him nearly two hours to post the messages.

Talbott, the museum’s director, said. In 2003 the Wadsworth had planned an expansion that would have cost $120 million and required the museum to close for two years, but that plan was abandoned, along with a later plan that would have spread the museum into the former Hartford Times building. The museum  American’s oldest public art institution, opened in 1842  operated with budget deficits for several years and went through five directors and three acting directors in a decade as it tried to find its footing in a city with a high poverty rate. Composed of five separate but contiguous buildings built over more than a century, the museum will remain open during the renovation, which is expected to be completed by the end of next year.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/arts/25arts-WADSWORTHATH_BRF.html

On Tuesday, Britain’s National Heritage Memorial Fund gave a grant of £1.29 million (about $1.9 million) to two museums that will keep the treasure, having raised £3.3 million (about $4.9 million) to keep the collection intact, The Guardian reported. The Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent museums will pay that money to Mr. Herbert and Fred Johnson, the farmer in whose field the hoard was found, having raised donations from around the world in a campaign that began in January. David Starkey, the historian who started the fund-raising campaign, told The Guardian, “Frankly they’d have been demented not to give the money.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/arts/design/25arts-GRANTENSURES_BRF.html

To qualify for the November election, the ballot needed 433,971 signatures.

2010-03-25,New Ways to Gauge the Finite Atmosphere,"I recently became aware of fascinating efforts by Adam Nieman to help society appreciate environmental challenges in fresh ways by visualizing volumes that are otherwise abstractions. In 2003 he created the image above, illustrating the volume of the world’s oceans and atmosphere (if the air were all at sea-level density) by rendering them as spheres sitting next to the Earth instead of spread out over its surface. To my eye, this helps powerfully convey the finite nature of these shared global assets. In general, I think there’s great merit in conceiving and testing new ways to communicate visually on the keystone issues of this blog (energy and climate, population and consumption, the relationship between humans and other life). Click here for his globe showing all the world’s land types as “islands” (and note how tiny the urban islet is).",Science,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/new-ways-to-gauge-the-finite-atmosphere/

Hauser & Wirth represents the estate of the sculptor Eva Hesse (1936-70), and assembled on the table were essentially outtakes from her studio— delicate, insistently handmade studies in papier-caché (a version of papier-mâché), cheesecloth and bits of adhesive. Not quite works in their own right, they were still riveting in their suggestion of themes that had preoccupied Hesse throughout her decade-long career (cut short by her death from brain cancer at age 34): plasticity, an engagement with ephemeral materials, the elusive and incomplete nature of memory, and a redolent corporeality.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/just-looking-eva-hesse/

Compiled from more than 16 hours of performances, “Phish 3D” has a downright economical running time of just over two hours (though your overall experience may vary) and will include songs from the band’s start-to-finish cover of the Rolling Stones album “Exile on Main Street,” as well as its acoustic set. Sneak preview screenings for “Phish 3D,” will take place on  when else?  4/20, followed by its official opening on April 30. More information can be found at phish3dmovie.com.

She is a neuro­psychiatrist (the prefix makes any title sound smarter) who has put her professional training behind a breezy, incautious account of how the brain, urged on by hormones, makes men and women act completely differently.

In three weeks she had crated up the St. Petersburg household, settled the accounts and prepared to set off, across 2,000 miles, to join her husband in Paris. It was winter. Europe remained pockmarked by the Napoleonic Wars. With her Mrs. Adams would take knives and forks; hidden bags of gold and silver; a governess; two servants, one of them trustworthy; and 7-year-old Charles Francis Adams, whose third language was English.

So does the metaphor. During the bubble years, encouraged by cheap credit and instant gratification, we got used to living beyond our means, ignoring the consequences. “The Hole We’re In” criticizes our rabid consumer culture, as well as the people who’ve bought into it without examining the actual or hidden costs.

The scientists wanted to see how important “contact comfort” was to an infant’s attachment to its mother — whether, given the choice, a baby preferred a “mother” that fed it or one that cuddled it.

Part of the beguiling genius of “The Whale,” a rhapsodic meditation on all things cetacean, is that Philip Hoare so suggestively explores the English origins of Herman Melville’s masterpiece while providing his own quirky, often revelatory take on the more familiar aspects of the novel. But “The Whale” is about much more than the literary sources of “Moby-Dick.” Always in the foreground of Hoare’s narrative is the whale itself, a creature that haunts and fascinates him as he travels to old whaling ports in both Britain and America, where he speaks with cetologists, naturalists, museum curators and former whalers on a quest to understand the whale, the cosmos and himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/books/review/Philbrick-t.html

The conservative Supreme Court had already struck down a series of New Deal programs. Roosevelt feared that the mostly aged justices would go on to destroy the rest of his legislative achievements before he would have a chance to make any new appointments. As a result, he proposed a “reform” of the courts that would, among other things, have added an additional justice to the Supreme Court for every current justice over the age of 70. It became the most controversial proposal of his presidency — so much so that it nearly paralyzed his administration for over a year and destroyed much of the fragile unity of the Democratic coalition.

That’s partly because of the director Raúl Marchand’s vibrant palette  predominantly red, orange and lime-green  and mostly because of the permanently arched eyebrow of the Mexican actor Humberto Busto, who plays the title character(s) and gives the film a point of view and a core of feeling.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/movies/26manuela.html

2010-03-26,Will Police Pay Increase Raise Hackles? And Highlights From Friday’s Bay Area Report,"An Awkward Time For a Wish to Come True | Three years ago, Gary P. Delagnes made a prediction to the members of the police union he heads: That in July 2010 the San Francisco police would be members of the “highest-paid major police department in the country.” But the police are reaching their long-awaited economic summit when the city is in an economic abyss. Gerry Shih reports that with a  record $522 million budget gap facing the city, some in city government are pushing for the police to give up the 4 percent raise scheduled to take effect July 1 or to face layoffs that could result in a $17 million savings. Despite recent sharp cuts in controversial overtime payments, total police compensation has been rising for the past five years, city data show. In 2009, 52 members officers and members of the command staff took home more than $200,000, with one retiring deputy chief taking home more than $500,000. “When I sit down with my constituency,” said Supervisor David Campos, who was on the police commission before running for district office, “the feeling I get is they want the police, but they don’t want the police being the best compensated in the country when we’re shutting down gyms and pools.”",U.S.,https://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/will-police-pay-hike-raise-hackles-and-highlights-from-fridays-bay-area-report/

That’s partly because of the director Raúl Marchand’s vibrant palette  predominantly red, orange and lime-green  and mostly because of the permanently arched eyebrow of the Mexican actor Humberto Busto, who plays the title character(s) and gives the film a point of view and a core of feeling.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/movies/26roundup-002.html

Both the waitress and Jan had disappeared, and Beard was the only person in the lobby. This was a long-forgotten experience from his school days, not only being late but feeling ignorant and incompetent and wretched, with everyone else mysteriously in the know, as though in league against him. Fatso Beard, always last, useless at team games. With that memory came added clumsiness and indecision. Although he was dressed in ski clothes of many layers, he was expected to climb inside this extra skin, even to wear his own boots inside another pair. There were inner gloves and giant outer gloves, a heavy balaclava made of carpet underlay to wear over his own, and goggles, and a motorcycle helmet.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/books/excerpt-solar.html

The suit says that Mr. Rose has not paid the management fees on recent concerts in Asia, South America and Canada, which grossed $12.5 million. A spokesman for Mr. Azoff declined to comment further on the suit, and representatives for Mr. Rose  including his new manager, Doc McGhee  did not respond to inquiries.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/arts/music/27arts-MANAGERSUESA_BRF.html
2010-03-29,"Dear Poppa, Sincerely, Jerry","Not every fan letter written to Ernest Hemingway merits its own display in a museum, but when its author is J. D. Salinger a little pomp and circumstance is understandable. On Sunday, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston will put on display a note from Salinger to Hemingway, written in 1946, that recounts a meeting between the authors and possibly hints at the coming publication of “The Catcher in the Rye,” The Associated Press reported. In the letter, a young Salinger writes to “Dear Poppa” that he is in a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, and says “the talks I had with you here were the only hopeful minutes of the whole business.” There are flashes of Salinger’s wit throughout: he asks Hemingway how his latest novel is coming along and warns him not to option it to Hollywood. (“You’re a rich guy,” he writes. “As Chairman of your many fan clubs, I know I speak for all the members when I say Down with Gary Cooper.”) Salinger also writes that he has “a very sensitive novel in mind, and I won’t have the author called a jerk in 1950.” (“I am a jerk,” he continues, “but the wrong people musn’t know it.”) Thomas Putnam, the director of library, told The A.P. there was no indication whether Hemingway ever wrote back.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/books/27arts-DEARPOPPASIN_BRF.html
2010-03-29,Artist Looks to Be Legal,"Though the artist Shepard Fairey, right, has become a museum darling, he’s still stayed close enough to his street-art roots to have been arrested, jailed overnight and sentenced to two years of probation last year in Boston for pasting his work on buildings before a retrospective at the city’s Institute of Contemporary Art. Now, as he prepares for a May exhibition at Deitch Projects in New York, Mr. Fairey is planning to put up street art the polite way, by asking building owners. “This is your chance to experience the art and be a part of the OBEY phenomenon, in addition to contributing to the enhancement of the urban landscape,” said an announcement this week on Mr. Fairey’s Web site (obeygiant.com), referring to the name of his studio and his trademark posters. His crew is looking for sites in Manhattan and Brooklyn where owners would allow artwork to be pasted  work that, depending on the kind of material to which it is glued, could last for years. In the past, Mr. Fairey has received permission to paste in some locations in Boston, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. He might be leaving behind his illicit means for good, or he might just be keeping a low profile until his other legal trouble blows over: a civil lawsuit and a criminal investigation stemming from his use of an Associated Press photograph without permission to make his well-known Barack Obama “Hope” poster.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/arts/design/27arts-ARTISTLOOKST_BRF.html
2010-03-29,Transgender Comedy Not Amusing to Some,"A film selected for the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, “Ticked-Off Trannies With Knives,” is having a similar angry effect on some transgender people and their supporters, prompting the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to call for the film’s removal from the lineup. In a listing for “Ticked-Off Trannies,” a comedy by Israel Luna, the film is described as a “campy homage to the exploitation films” in which “a group of transgender women are violently beaten and left for dead,” but then “the violated vixens turn deadly divas.” That summary alone was enough to prompt many angry comments at the festival’s Web site, tribecafilm.com. In a statement, GLAAD said, “The film, its title and its marketing misrepresent the lives of transgender women and use grotesque, exploitative depictions of violence against transgender women.” It urged its members to contact the festival and demand that the film be pulled. The festival responded in a statement: “The filmmakers provided a copy of this film to GLAAD in February, and for weeks the organization had been supportive to the filmmakers. In fact, GLAAD representatives advised the film’s producer, director and cast on how to describe the film to its core constituency.” The festival added that it “looks forward to the film’s premiere” next month.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/movies/27arts-TRANSGENDERC_BRF.html

Yannes, but you received only enough votes to place third in the online competition for the Diagram Prize for Oddest Book Title of the Year, the magazine announced on Friday. A total of 1,912 of the 4,553 ballots cast at TheBookSeller.com went to “Crocheting Adventures With Hyperbolic Planes” by Dr. Daina Taimina. In a statement, Philip Stone, charts editor of The Bookseller, said that Dr. Taimina’s book had won the prize, awarded to a work published in 2009, because, “very simply, the title is completely bonkers.” Second place went to “What Kind of Bean Is This Chihuahua?” by Tara Jansen-Meyer.

But early on Friday, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst condemned the performance, saying in a press release that “no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans.” Although Tarleton’s president, F. Dominic Dottavio, first defended the students’ right to perform a play he considered “offensive, crude and irreverent,” university officials changed course late Friday night, canceling the performance after receiving threatening calls and e-mail messages, according to The Star-Telegram.

2010-03-29,‘Dragon’ Rules the Box Office,"“How to Train Your Dragon” (above) was No. 1 at the North American box office over the weekend despite softer than expected ticket sales of about $43.3 million. Some Wall Street analysts expected opening-weekend sales of up to $60 million for this 3-D picture from DreamWorks Animation, on a par with the studio’s last release, “Monsters vs. Aliens.” A variety of factors may have dented “How to Train Your Dragon,” from a sudden glut of 3-D pictures to the decision last week by many theater chains to raise ticket prices. Animated titles also do better when they feature broad comedy, something this movie lacked. Still, positive reviews will likely help “How to Train Your Dragon” in the weeks ahead, when many children are out of school for spring break. “Alice in Wonderland” (Walt Disney Studios) was second with about $17.3 million for a new total of $293 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. The MGM comedy “Hot Tub Time Machine” was third with about $13.7 million, a so-so result considering the hefty promotional muscle the beleaguered studio put behind it. Sony’s “Bounty Hunter” was fourth with about $12.4 million ($38.8 million total), and “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” (20th Century Fox) was fifth with about $10 million ($35.8 million total).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/movies/29arts-DRAGONRULEST_BRF.html

High Court Justice Peter Kelly decided to make public a confidential settlement between Prince and MCD Productions after the promoters complained that Prince had not paid them. The original settlement, signed on Feb. 26, stemmed from Prince’s cancellation just a few days before the concert, at Croke Park stadium in Dublin in June 2008, with no explanation. MCD said 55,000 tickets had been sold, it had paid $950,000 to book the stadium and it had already paid Prince $1.5 million. Justice Kelly also ruled on Friday that Marc Geiger, Prince’s agent at William Morris, was not liable. Testifying in February, Mr. Geiger said he had warned Prince of MCD’s frustration, and Prince replied: “Tell the cat to chill.

The story of a young Helen Keller (Abigail Breslin, above left) learning to communicate under the guidance of her teacher, Annie Sullivan (Alison Pill, right), “The Miracle Worker” opened on March 3 to mixed reviews and never managed to attract much of an audience. The show’s grosses during full weeks of eight performances were uneven, ranging from $165,000 to $256,000. Mr. Richenthal had secured financing this month to keep the show running through mid-April in hopes of capturing a share of the school vacation market. He then left New York to tend to health issues, leaving his decision-making authority about the show to Ms. von Mueffling, his wife. In response to questions about why the show would not run until at least until mid-April, Ms. von Mueffling said in a statement: “In spite of additional advertising, ticket sales did not pick up as much as we thought they would.

He was a mischief-maker, an innocent, born in the jungle and lured into the strange world of humans,"" writes Edward Rothstein. ""But as the exhibition points out, at least outside of the books' frames, Curious George really did save the day, and more than once. In early September 1939, just after World War II began, the Reys  a husband-and-wife team of German Jews living in Paris  sought refuge at Château Feuga, an old castle owned by some friends in southern France. At such a time, Hans A. Rey wrote in a letter, 'it feels ridiculous to be thinking about children's books.' But that is what they were doing, prolifically, including a book about a monkey named Fifi, who later became known as Curious George.""

The Centre Pompidou-Metz’s inaugural exhibition has blockbuster written all over it; the coyly titled ‘‘Masterpieces?’’ will feature some 800 of the world’s most prized modern works, from Alexander Calder’s ‘‘Josephine Baker IV’’ to Yves Klein’s “Grande anthropophagie bleue (ANT 76).’’ A TGV rail link makes the museum an easy 80-minute trip from Paris. And then there is the building itself. Conceived by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines as a series of modules around a central spire, it is flamboyantly capped by an undulating lattice roof structure (made from 11 miles of glue-laminated timber beams) and sheathed in a fiberglass and Teflon membrane that gives the place an otherworldly glow when lit up at night.

This is the kind of career-as-meta-gag that smart young writers dream of, but almost nobody can pull off. Cody, a Los Angeles resident (who in an earlier life was Brook Busey from Chicago), made her name with the Oscar-winning screenplay for “Juno.” She followed up with the Showtime series “United States of Tara,” a writerly tour de force about a suburban mom (played by Toni Collette) with multiple personalities, now in its second season. “It’s safe to say that I need everything to be embellished, creatively or otherwise,” says Cody, 31. “Just like I’m inclined to put on too much jewelry or get too many tattoos, I need my writing to be a little over-the-top.

The theater has made Ms. Whoriskey its artistic director, effective immediately, and she will select its remaining plays for the season; Mr. Sher was named the theater’s artistic director emeritus. “Working with Kate over the past months has affirmed for us that we are ready now to move forward with her vision for the theater as the sole artistic director,” the theater’s board president, Kim A. Anderson, said in a statement. On Sunday, the producers of the Broadway revival of “The Miracle Worker,” directed by Ms. Whoriskey at Circle in the Square theater, announced it would close on April 4.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/theater/30arts-AONEWOMANJOB_BRF.html

Now John Cassidy, The New Yorker’s financial writer, has delivered an impressive two-part contribution to the genre. Cassidy supports the health care bill on moral grounds, but he has deep doubts about its fiscal sustainability. On this front, he makes two points that many right-of-center wonks have been hammering on for a while now. First, the individual mandate is “a bit of a sham,” and lots and lots of people will probably just pay the modest fine (or dodge it) until they get sick, at which point they’ll show up demanding their guaranteed insurance policy, sending costs skyrocketing. Second, the subsidies for the individual market are so much more generous than the existing tax deduction for employer-provided health care that employers will have an enormous incentive to offload their employees onto the new exchanges:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/the-heresies-of-john-cassidy/

On her Web site Ms. Meyer writes that she will be publishing a new work set in the “Twilight” universe, to be released by  Little Brown & Company on June 5. The novella, called “The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner,” is told from the perspective of the title character, a newborn vampire who turns up briefly in the third “Twilight” novel, “Eclipse.” Ms. Meyer said the story was originally written for “The Twilight Saga: The Official Guide” but was ultimately too long to include in that book.

At that time the concept for the series was undecided; more recently, its co-stars Chris Parnell and Horatio Sanz said the show would feature Mr. Heder as a fallen financial whiz who returns to his hometown. On Monday night a publicist for Mr. Heder said in a statement: “Comedy Central, Gary Sanchez Productions and Jon Heder have mutually decided to part ways over creative differences with the character.” It is not known who is being considered to replace Mr. Heder if the channel proceeds with the show.

2010-03-31,Eyes Have It,"According to Ver Bien Para Aprender Mejor (‘‘See Well to Learn Better’’), a program sponsored by the Mexican government, about one-tenth of the country’s children do poorly in school simply because they can’t see well. That’s not just because glasses are expensive, but also because in Mexico they’re often perceived as evidence of a handicap. In an attempt to address both problems, Ver Bien turned to the industrial designer Yves Béhar, who, as the creator of the One Laptop Per Child XO (the original $100 computer), has earned a reputation as a maker of inexpensive, attractive products for kids in the developing world. Béhar designed a set of split frames, which makes the glasses less costly to assemble in the field and lets kids customize them using a smorgasbord of color options. ‘‘They’re at the intersection of practicality and personal expression,’’ Béhar says. With the help of Augen, the manufacturer, Ver Bien can keep the total cost — including an eye exam and shipping — at just $10. This year alone, it will give away 400,000 pairs. ‘‘This is about using the very best not to make the most expensive product,’’ Béhar says, ‘‘but to make the most valuable product — and to make it efficiently.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/eyes-have-it/

Alejandro Alcocer, a watch fanatic and design entrepreneur who has previously delved into skateboarding, catering and handbag design, followed the legend of a black watch supposedly released by Rolex in the late 1960s for the Royal British Army soldiers stationed in South Africa. It was thought that only 500 were made, but Rolex never confirmed their distribution and they became the holy grail of watch collecting. So Alcocer decided to make his own, with the help of a Pennsylvania-based company that had previously done contract work for the U.S. Army but had fallen on tough times. Aside from the dial and crystal, which remain in vintage original condition, the watches were transformed into matte black beauties using highly specialized chemical applications.

These are impressively thorough documents, and you may find that many of your objections are addressed in their pages. Where a subject like this is concerned, no statistical assessment is going to be completely dispositive, but I am persuaded that the John Jay/N.R.B. portrait of the pattern of abuse — the rise from the late ’50s till 1980, and the drop-off since — is as rigorous as one can hope for at the moment.

The 33-year-old sex-crime case against Mr. Polanski was jolted two weeks ago by new claims of improper conduct by Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who originally handled the case and is now dead. On Tuesday the Los Angeles County district attorney, Stephen L. Cooley, joined deputies in opposing the latest appeal, which seeks among other things to have Mr. Polanski sentenced while he remains abroad. Mr. Polanski was charged with rape and other crimes after having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He pleaded guilty to a charge of having sex with a minor but fled the United States in 1978 before sentencing.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/movies/01arts-SWISSAWAITDE_BRF.html

LL Cool J, whose real name is James Todd Smith, wrote Tuesday on his Twitter account that Fox News had “lifted an old interview I gave in 2008 to someone else” and was “misrepresenting to the public” in its promotion of the show.

Fox News said that it conducted an interview with LL Cool J about 18 months ago for a program called “Real American Stories,” and that it did not need his permission to use the interview on the new program. In a statement Fox News said, “As it appears that Mr. Smith does not want to be associated with a program that could serve as an inspiration to others, we are cutting his interview from the special and wish him the best with his fledgling acting career.” In addition to his “NCIS” role, LL Cool J has starred in the films “Any Given Sunday” and “Deep Blue Sea” and on the television series “In the House.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/arts/television/01arts-FOXNEWSDROPS_BRF.html

It is the most measured and keenly perceptive analysis of how Wall Street careered off the tracks from its basic role in our society. Instead of being a vital engine for economic progress, Wall Street has spent the past two decades feathering its own nest at the expense of the entire country and beyond. A mighty pushback is necessary before our economy can right itself, but the concept of a transfer tax on frenetic trading-for-the-sake-of-trading is a weak solution. Such activities, which benefit only a few but have the potential for severe repercussions, must be isolated so only the players themselves take the risks, reap the rewards or take the hits directly.
