2011-08-02,Criss to Succeed Radcliffe In ‘How to Succeed’,"January is often the cruelest month for Broadway box offices, as holiday tourists head home, students go back to school and New Yorkers hibernate from the cold and snow. Last winter the lead producers of the Broadway revival of “Promises, Promises” closed the show on Jan. 2 rather than gamble money on recasting their two stars, Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth, and risk a slide in ticket sales. Those same producers are now behind another Broadway revival, “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” but they have opted to replace their star, Daniel Radcliffe, who finishes his run as the scheming executive J. Pierrepont Finch on New Year’s Day. Confirming rumors that have been circulating for a couple of weeks, the producers announced on Monday that Mr. Radcliffe (of “Harry Potter” fame) will be succeeded by a lesser-known actor, Darren Criss, who has become popular recently on the Fox series “Glee” playing a gay high school student and show choir member who exudes charisma and self-confidence. In casting Mr. Criss the producers are seeking to appeal to at least some of the teenagers, women and gay men who often mob Mr. Radcliffe at the stage door after performances. Mr. Criss is scheduled for only a three-week engagement, Jan. 3 through 22. In their statement announcing Mr. Criss the producers did not say if they plan to cast another actor after him, close the $8.5 million production after he departs, or try to extend his run. A spokesman for the musical said the producers had not made decisions about the future of the show after the Criss run.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/criss-to-succeed-radcliffe-in-how-to-succeed/

NOAA said the zone measured 6,765 square miles, which is not a record. But scientists warned that the data could be misleading because a tropical storm had roiled and mixed gulf waters. They said that levels of the chemicals that deplete oxygen were rising year to year, weakening the gulf’s resistance to pollution.

2011-08-02,Fantasy Focus: Trade-Deadline Fallout,"The Blue Jays somehow converted some middling prospects into Colby Rasmus, a center fielder who thrived in the major leagues a year ago at age 23. Next year Toronto could feature an outfield of Jose Bautista, Rasmus and Travis Snider/Eric Thames, and an infield with Adam Lind, Brett Lawrie and Yunel Escobar, to go along with a power-hitting catcher in J.P. Arencibia. With Ricky Romero and Brandon Morrow developing and Brett Cecil recently building on a solid rookie year, the Jays could crash the Yanks-Sox-Rays triumvirate as early as 2012.The Indians coughed up some top pitching prospects (Drew Pomeranz and Alex White) for Ubaldo Jimenez, and it makes you wonder why the Yankees didn’t offer a similar package (including Dellin Betances and Manny Banuelos), or, if they did, why the Rockies didn’t want it. Jimenez has a good contract and is under team control through 2014, so unless Colorado suspected there was something wrong with him, this seems like a good price. It’s not entirely true that there’s no such thing as a pitching prospect, especially when you’re talking about players who blew away the high minors like Tim Lincecum and Tommy Hanson or mega-talents like David Price or Stephen Strasburg. But for the next tier down, which is how I view both the Indians’ and Yankees’ duos, the failure rate is awfully high.

Retirement of this popular and very visible shuttle program further strains the already diminished agency. “Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats,” according to The Times. This is not the first time in NASA’s history when the agency faced publicity troubles. Back in 1974, after the success of the Mercury and Apollo programs, but before the initiation of the Shuttle Program, NASA was convinced by the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in its “Federal Graphics Improvement Program,” and do what many companies these days do to revive their image: undergo a redesign.Up until that point, NASA had been primarily using an insignia adapted by James Modarelli, the head of NASA’s Lewis Research Center Reports Division. This logo, created in 1959 and affectionately dubbed “The Meatball,” relied heavily on multiple visual metaphors. According to NASA’s Web site, “the sphere represents a planet, the stars represent space, the red chevron is a wing representing aeronautics (the latest design in hypersonic wings at the time the logo was developed), and then there is an orbiting spacecraft going around the wing.” Although charming in its quirkiness, the meatball proved difficult to reproduce given the printing technology available at the time and the variety of applications it would need to adorn.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/who-made-those-nasa-logos/

To finance his growth, Mr. Justice kept borrowing money from the bank, not realizing that the more he grew, the more he needed to borrow because his revenue was not covering his expenses. The loans meant he had money in his accounts — but it was borrowed money. “I knew how to print a financial statement from QuickBooks, but I couldn’t tell you what it meant,” he said.

Vanessa Grigoriadis’s piece in New York magazine, borrowing heavily from interviews in Le Monde, Le Nouvel Observateur and the biography Madame DSK, which is currently available only in French, is filled with details of the marriage (both left spouses for each other; she prefers Paris, he their riad in Marrakesh; she broke off a friendship when her friend suggested D.S.K.’s affairs were too numerous to be forgivable even by a Frenchwoman). It also reminds us of Sinclair’s striking readiness, past and present, to stand behind and by her man, despite having a prominent career as a TV host and holding the purse strings.For those of you hankering for more of the “other woman,” it’s worth reading the account of one Marie-Victorine M. in the Daily Beast, who claims to have found D.S.K. irresistibly magnetic (their eyes met across a room and for four months they had a torrid affair), and yet who believes the account of the Sofitel maid is true.

Partly it has to do with their origin myth: they recorded the album at the renowned producer Jonathan Wilson’s studio in Laurel Canyon after playing a run of small hootenannies there. But mostly it has to do with their sound, which has a warm, stripped-down Americana feel frequently described as “vintage.” Recently, the group got about as big a nod as four guys playing folk rock could hope for: Robbie Robertson, the somewhat reclusive songwriter from the Band, asked them to back him in a series of rare performances. Now in the middle of an East Coast tour to promote their follow-up record, “Nothing Is Wrong,” which was released this summer, Dawes seems both honored and amused to have been credited with leading a revival of the Laurel Canyon sound.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/the-weight/

It was that, being in our teens and 20s in the early 1990s, we had grown up in the penumbra of the great eclipsing nostalgia of the baby boomers, with their 1950s “Happy Days”; their 1960s (the Greatest Decade Ever Told); and their serial losses of innocence, via the Kennedys’ assassinations, Vietnam, Watergate, etc. — a record of revirginization to rival any evangelical chastity-pledge campaign.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/the-gen-x-nostalgia-boom.html
2011-08-04,Seeing Things | Size Matters,"The New York architecture firm Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis (LTL) is taking up residence on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame with “4 Projects: 4 Scales,” a new exhibition at Woodbury University’s Hollywood outpost, at 6518 Hollywood Boulevard. Riffing on Rem Koolhaas’s iconic 1990s book “S, M, L, XL,” the exhibition focuses on projects that range in size from the micro to the massive, in a mix of built and speculative work. For the site-specific installation, LTL inserted a three-sided container with etched and printed surfaces into a long, narrow gallery space. Visitors entering the container make their way through the exhibition from the largest of the four projects on view to the smallest, walking on a white-painted wood floor that is laser-etched with the plans of each project. Canted walls of backlit panels provide photographs, architectural drawings and descriptive text. “Water Proving Ground,” at 69 million square feet, is LTL’s extra-large project. This visionary master plan for the northwest corner of New York Harbor was conceived as part of MoMA/P.S. 1’s recent “Rising Currents” initiative, which studied the impact of anticipated sea-level change on the city. The other projects in the show are all built works: Arthouse, a contemporary art center in Austin, Tex.; the Sullivan Family Student Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie; and Lobby Wall, a site-specific sculpture for the lobby of Memorial Sloan-Kettering’s new Manhattan building, which is the smallest of the projects at 108 square feet.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/seeing-things-size-matters/

Smith’s Vietnam-era draftees, present-day stevedores, touring musicians and Iraq war veterans, along with their “black, white, sallow, olive, red, black kids,” inspire grand flights, tumultuous catalogs, as in a poem about drought: “Wherever there was water — the upended lid of a mayonnaise jar / in the gutter, the gutter, the sober silver puddle, the frenzied lake, / the tear ducts, the dew, the beveled rain — we drank.” When Smith is not speeding through such cascades of nouns, he revs up other repetitions: “They come like rats. . . . They want to save you. They want to slap you silly. They pet / the kitty. They bring gossip. . . . They’ve got questions for further study.” The plural noun to which each “They” refers is an obscenity most poets would not use.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/devotions-by-bruce-smith-book-review.html

Financing and Administering New York’s New Parks’ (Tuesday) Creating and maintaining green spaces during a budget crunch is not exactly a walk in the park. An urban oasis designed today is very different from one designed in the days of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux; you need only look at the High Line on the West Side of Manhattan, or Brooklyn Bridge Park, above, at the water’s edge in Brooklyn. A planned expansion there is expected to include several buildings of private housing — along with tennis courts, a swimming pool and other amenities — with payments from the buildings used to support the park’s operating expenses. On Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. Adrian Benepe, the New York parks commissioner, will discuss the history of the city’s parks and some issues surrounding park creation with Alexander D. Garvin, of the Yale School of Architecture, and Catherine Nagel, the executive director of the City Parks Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington. Among the questions: Where will the money come from? What makes a park successful? The talk is part of an Urban Forum series at the museum (Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street) on the city’s infrastructure. It costs $12 ($8 for 65+ and students and $6 for members) and requires reservations: (917) 492-3395. Seating will be provided, so there’s no need for blankets or lawn chairs, and please, no picnics.

In the watercolors for which he was, and remains, most renowned, there is a hectic, sometimes luminously beautiful but often murky struggle between Cubist order and dynamic flux. Applied similarly to Manhattan cityscapes and Maine land- and seascapes, his touch is brusque, and his colors range from garish to drab. The invariably modest scale feels claustrophobic, despite the expansive subjects. Emotion is muted. An astringent pantheism is often suggested, but he was no visionary, and eros, whether carnal or mystical, is almost wholly absent.

If energy is the issue, Mr. Ratner should be able to provide a fix. He is known as a film aficionado and an ambitious filmmaker whose is currently making a Snow White project for Relativity Media, and has dozens of projects in development.

Cartwright illustrates the folly, showing how the recent financial collapse resulted from speculative fantasies and from an attitude that none of the risks were quite real.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/other-peoples-money-by-justin-cartwright-book-review.html

But he quickly noticed that all his friends who were waiting tables and pursuing art on the side looked just as tired as the office drones they were serving. So he joined an investment firm instead and took seven years off from writing. Towles, today a principal in a money management concern, says the novel’s success, though wonderful, has been less important than simply finishing something he thought was good. “I would’ve sold it for a penny, just to be able to say ‘O.K., I did it,’ ” he said in a telephone interview. “I always thought I was a writer on the inside, but after a few years of not writing you can’t make that claim anymore.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2011-08-08,The Government’s Calling About a Table. Should I Take the Call?,"The end of summer brings a surge in calls from government clients, mostly from the military, looking to spend remaining dollars in their budgets before the fiscal year ends on Oct. 1. This year is no exception. The surge has started and is most likely to peak at the end of August. Just last week we got calls from the State Department, the Army and the Marines. The person on the phone is generally a low-level officer, responding to a request from a superior for pricing on a large and fancy table. Our bid will be presented to the upper ranks as one of a number of ways to spend their remaining money. Consequently, we sell a much lower percentage of these inquiries than those from private clients. But August is usually a slower month for private business, so we take the time to write proposals anyway.",Business Day,https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/the-governments-calling-about-a-table-should-i-take-the-call/

For example, the Edna heel, a reimagined stiletto loafer, “is beetle-crusher when it’s in black and white,” she says, “and then we did a red and leopard version that has an element of Victoriana.” She’s certainly got a bead on the new monarchy. A pair of nude silk slippers looks fit for a duchess or a Park Avenue princess.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/the-red-shoes-are-coming/

It downgraded Enron days before the company went bankrupt. Its willingness to slap a AAA rating on securitized subprime junk was the foundation upon which the entire financial crisis was built. And now, to show that it’s got some spine, S.& P. decided to downgrade the United States? From a purely economic standpoint, the likelihood of a U.S. default is nil. As my friend Daniel Alpert, a founding managing partner of Westwood Capital, put it: “The size of the U.S. economy, the wealth of its inhabitants and the assets of the sovereign entity itself are unquestionably more than adequate to repay, with interest, all of the $14 trillion or so of the nation’s debt.” He added, “Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of finance and economics can figure that out.” On Monday, with the market collapsing, where did investors rush to put their money?

What he likes about the Pradas, he explains, is “the mix of sharp tailoring and casual leisure.” Having held his post for little over a year, he has pushed Adidas to hybridize in a similar manner. “When I’m in Berlin and I see how the young guys and girls are dressing, none of them are wearing sneakers anymore. So you think, if these are the target consumers, and we are only selling sneakers, well, what are we going to do?” The answer may be found in Adidas SLVR. Priced somewhere between Originals and Y-3 (also under Schoenberger’s purview), the line has been reimagined for fall under his personal design stewardship. “It’s amazing for such a big company to be so open for discussions,” he says. With SLVR, it is a “new approach but still very much in the language of Adidas.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/silver-lining-2/

2011-08-11,Now Playing | Plastique Ludique,"At Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris, the summer crowds have gravitated to the Hussein Chalayan show and the exhibition of highlights from Ralph Lauren’s car collection. I was glad to see both on a recent trip, but I was also lucky to spot a sign for another, less-heralded exhibition at the museum. “Plastique Ludique” (“Playful Plastic”), which runs until Nov. 6, presents the work of the Czech toy designer Libuse Niklova (1934-1981), whose work with plastics, particularly in the 1960s and ’70s, changed the look — and the nature — of toys in her native country. Niklova believed that children should be able to play as creatively as possible, and the development of plastics after World War II offered a helpful tool. Her inflatable buffalo, giraffe and elephant, with their simplified, graphic silhouettes and bright, pop colors, could be used as chairs or pool toys for small children. (The three have been reissued in limited numbers and are for sale at the museum’s shop.) And Niklova’s ingenious use of pleated plastic piping produced animals with accordion-like midsections that squealed when squeezed. In contrast to the Chalayan and Lauren exhibitions, which are about the more expensive pleasures of the material world, “Plastique Ludique” offers a surprising, refreshing look at a more modest — yet no less inventive — endeavor.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/now-playing-plastique-ludique/

And, O.K., given the current omnipresence of the sound in pop music, it’s like hating the accordion during some strange period of accordion-fascism during which everyone’s paying top dollar to sound like early Los Lobos or Weird Al.

No wonder the rest of France calls it Planète Mars. And the news gets better: Named a European Capital of Culture for 2013, the historically gritty port is looking up, thanks to a waterfront renovation, a sleek new tram system, a first wave of design hotels, a generation of young restaurant and night-life impresarios and a homegrown fashion scene.

For example, most of the major weather-focused Web sites offer streamlined versions for mobile users — just point the phone’s browser to sites like m.accuweather.com, m.weather.com or m.weatherbug.com for a quick look at the latest conditions. If you do not want to keep checking an app or site, you can also have the information find you when a storm is coming.

Kern and his partner, Stephanie Danan, film producer and fashion designer, have founded Co, a collection of luxurious mega-basics: slip dresses, silk tanks and skirts, L.B.D.’s, skinny leather pants and the kind of big old fancy furs that Margot Tenenbaum would adore. The Royal Tenenbaum, in fact, is the personification of the Co customer — a woman who pictures herself in a variety of cinematic situations. To illuminate this idea, Kern and Danan (far right) collaborated with the actress Élodie Bouchez and the director Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk on a four-minute film that they describe as a period piece with a sci-fi twist. (The film will have its premiere on T’s Web site during Fashion Week.) “We wanted to give the clothes an identity through the characters that we imagine inhabiting them,” Danan says.

In the gold-for-salt commerce of Saharan and Sahel tribes, for example, the Saharans would leave a salt pile by the banks of the Niger, then remove themselves so their clients could, in seclusion, deposit a sum of gold. At that point, the merchants would return, but if the payment was deemed insufficient, they would leave it with the salt and withdraw. The Sahel merchants would approach again, and this good-faith dance of advance and retreat would be repeated until both parties felt content with the deal.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/the-echo-chamber-by-luke-williams-book-review.html

2011-08-12,Dragons Ascendant: George R. R. Martin and the Rise of Fantasy,"It’s a high time for high fantasy. Novels about wizards outsell (and often outshine) the most glittering literary fiction titles; the contemporary romantic hero generally sports a pair of fangs; and even now the five remaining earthlings who haven’t read “The Lord of the Rings” are being hunted down and put to the sword. Yet for all of fantasy’s successes, there remains a chip on the spaulder of the genre. As Michael Agger put it in 2009, reviewing Lev Grossman’s Harry Potter-­influenced novel “The Magicians”: “Perhaps a fantasy novel meant for adults can’t help being a strange mess of effects. . . . Sounds like fun, but aren’t we a little old for this?” And with that, hundreds of years of fantastical writing are reduced to 20-­sided dice, pencil nubs, half-filled Coke cans and the crushing realization that no, your elven rogue’s dagger is not going to be effective against green slime.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/george-r-r-martin-and-the-rise-of-fantasy.html

Poets and artists have long viewed love as a prime mover, but by the beginning of the last century, scientists and philosophers were dismissing it as socially and scientifically irrelevant. Love was confined to private life, where only women and novelists and psychoanalysts were supposed to pay much attention to it. Then, a little more than half a century ago, biologists and economists and psychologists decided that love mattered after all, and began conducting experiments to determine how much.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/all-about-love-by-lisa-appignanesi-book-review.html

Perhaps that was why I found it irritating; or else it was the suggestion that punk rockers would break bread with someone who had flowers in her hair. Thanks to Simon Reynolds’s “Retromania,” I now understand that she “purposefully conflated 1967 and 1977 to speak to the vague nostalgia felt by many young people for a lost golden age when music had power and integrity.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/retromania-by-simon-reynolds-book-review.html

She lived to be 98, and even after her hair went white, she was not shy about posing for photographs.

With Ms. Osei leading the way and a sliver of moon still hanging in the sky, they scouted three square blocks to make sure all of their taxis had been picked up by drivers.

From the very start of Lorene Cary’s latest novel, when Rayne sets off to visit Nana Selma, the great-­grandmother who raised him, he’s enveloped by a sense of home. Taking along his girlfriend’s 7-year-old son, Rayne has high hopes for what the trip will give the boy: “How good it would be for him to have the experience of earlier generations, to spend time in a rural setting, to know from their own experience that black people . . . owned land and barns and silos, that they had rights to water from creeks and streams.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/if-sons-then-heirs-by-lorene-cary-book-review.html

On his first night in the city, he met two strangers. One would become his brother-in-law; through the other, he found the job in which he has worked for 20 years.

That was surely the hope of administrators at Duke and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, when they chose Jonathan Safran Foer’s “Eating Animals” as the joint summer reading for this fall’s incoming freshmen. So far, the carnivore-unfriendly choice does not seem to have elicited any complaints from the local barbecue industry, though the state’s educators have courted controversy before. In 2002, conservative pundits and state legislators howled when U.N.C. assigned Michael Sells’s “Approaching the Qur’an,” calling it an insult to the memory of Sept. 11. In 2003, a student group called The Committee for a Better Carolina denounced that year’s choice, Barbara Ehrenreich’s “Nickel and Dimed,” as a “classic Marxist rant” and “intellectual pornography with no redeeming characteristics.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Fleischer’s “Follow Me Quietly,” and “The Threat,” directed by Felix E. Feist, reflect an entirely different set of concerns from two movies produced at the end of the ’50s: “The Purple Gang” (1959), directed by Frank McDonald, and “The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond” (1960) by Budd Boetticher.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/movies/homevideo/on-dvd-the-threat-the-purple-gang-and-legs-diamond.html

I typically read mdtravelhealth.com to find out what vaccines I need, ask my primary care doctor to call these into a good pharmacy that charges wholesale on vaccines (e.g. the Cure, 1025A Third Avenue, at 60th Street, Manhattan; thecureshop.com), then pick them up at the pharmacy and go to my physician who administers them for a normal insurance co-pay.

2011-08-12,Walking Martha’s Vineyard,"DOWN a looping path deep in the Martha’s Vineyard woods, history keeps a muted vigil. It was here at Waskosim’s Rock, more than 300 years ago, that leaders of the native Wampanoag tribe met with the Mayhews (named after one of the area’s first settlers, Thomas Mayhew) to create a “Middle Line” division of property. Southwest of the boundary would remain in native control; north and east would be Mayhew territory. The great natural monument, lichen dappled and framed within a modest clearing, always surprises me when I approach it. There are no special signs along the trail. Nor will you find one of those historical markers, in cast iron, lettering raised, once you arrive. In fact, count yourself lucky to find the trailhead at all. Waskosim’s Rock, just off North Road in Chilmark, Mass., and the rest of the many splendid walking trails on Martha’s Vineyard, are a casually well-kept secret.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/travel/walking-marthas-vineyard.html

But the biggest criticism Auto-Tune’s critics level against it is that it’s the sonic equivalent of plastic surgery or ‘roids, a digital fix that lets lousy singers skip over that whole learning-to-carry-a-tune thing (boring!) and cut straight to pop stardom’s V.I.P. room. And there’s some truth to that — while the listening public’s acceptance of Auto-Tune has undeniably opened up new avenues of expression for rappers and singers, it’s also enabled some of the world’s most annoying famous people to annoy us in new ways. (Note: We mean no disrespect by including Drake here — his Auto-Tune songs are actually pretty great. But he started out as an actor, so technically he belongs in this category. Hopefully the fact that he is a rich, beautiful man will soften the blow.)",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/love-letter-to-auto-tune-final-installment/

2011-08-15,The Making of a Debt Spiral,"DEBT spirals: the term sounds ominous. As it should — these market vortexes are posing grave dangers to the global economy right now. A national debt crisis is a bank run writ large, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and co-author with Carmen M. Reinhart of “This Time Is Different,” a history of financial crises. When a country like Greece goes deep into debt, bond investors start to worry they won’t get their money back. What can happen next is a debt spiral, a vicious circle of sinking confidence, rising borrowing costs and, ultimately, rising debt burdens. As investors lose confidence in a country, its bond prices drop, its bond yields rise and its government must pay higher interest rates to borrow. That, in turn, deepens the debt problem — and the whole thing starts over again. Debt spirals are dangerous, but they aren’t inevitable. “Country debt crises are essentially political,” Mr. Rogoff says. Governments can often stem the crisis by reducing spending, raising taxes or both. But such steps are particularly difficult — and politically unappetizing — when growth is slack, as it is now in much of the world. Tightening the belt slows growth even more, eroding tax revenue and — you guessed it — increasing the debt burden, at least in the short term. Of course, the best way to avoid a debt spiral is to avoid running up a lot of debt in the first place — when the economy is doing well. “If you walk outside without a raincoat and the sun is shining, you are fine,” Mr. Rogoff says. “But if it starts pouring, you are going to get wet.” — <em>DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN</em>",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/14/business/markets-debt-spiral.html

He has won five Academy Awards, four Golden Globes, five Emmys and 21 Grammys. He wrote the music for all the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies and the first three Harry Potter films. He was the one who wrote the fearsome two-note motif from “Jaws,” and the famous five-note intergalactic message he composed for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” At 79, he is still going strong and recently finished scores for two more Spielberg movies, “The Adventures of Tin Tin” and “War Horse.” ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/john-williams-lets-his-muses-carry-him-along/

2011-08-19,When Art Happened to L.A.,"For contemporary art in the 1950s and ’60s, there was New York and that was it. So the old story goes. But it’s wrong. If there’s one thing that recent globally minded art history has taught us, it’s that after World War II, new art, and lots of it, was turning up in cities every­where. Los Angeles was one, and in the late ’50s, almost to its own surprise, it had a big art moment. That moment, which lasted about a decade, is the subject of “Rebels in Paradise: The Los Angeles Art Scene and the 1960s,” by Hunter Drohojowska-Philp. The book has much to recommend it: it’s fast-paced, well researched, accessibly anecdotal. But as an account of a still under­studied episode in American postwar culture, it’s oddly lopsided. It corrects one imbalance — the “only in New York” idea — but ignores ­others.

2011-08-19,"A Novel of Grief, Memorials and a Muslim Architect in Post-9/11 America","When, in December 2009, The New York Times first reported plans for a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, there was little controversy. Only subsequently, as a result of protests organized by groups like the Freedom Defense Initiative and Stop Islamization of America, did the project become the subject of passionate debate. It was they who named the community center the “ground zero mosque.” In the months that followed, other vociferous opponents of the project emerged, among them not only conservative politicians like Newt Gingrich and some of the families of victims of 9/11, but also a number of Muslim leaders, who felt that the choice of site was insensitive and would complicate Muslim relations with the broader community. The controversy gave rise to a media frenzy that reached its height in the late summer of 2010. One imagines that the former New York Times journalist Amy Waldman heard these arguments with a combination of recognition and, perhaps, faint dismay: the general topic of her as yet unpublished first novel, “The Submission,” was proving disturbingly prescient. Her carefully imagined fiction was in the process of becoming fact.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/the-submission-by-amy-waldman-book-review.html
2011-08-19,Last Lullaby for My Son,"“I was afraid I’d hurt him. Before he was born, I was afraid that I would hurt my son,” Kelle Groom writes of her infant child in her memoir, “I Wore the Ocean in the Shape of a Girl.” For decades, Groom did not ask for details about Tommy, the son she’d had at age 19, whom she’d given up to her aunt and uncle to raise, and who died from leukemia at 14 months.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/i-wore-the-ocean-in-the-shape-of-a-girl-by-kelle-groom-book-review.html
2011-08-19,Are All of Our Leaders Mad?,"After examining the psychological histories of a few living leaders and a whole little power necropolis, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Program at Tufts University Medical Center, is ready to proclaim a link between madness and achievement that is usually reserved for poets, not prime ministers: “Depression makes leaders more realistic and empathic, and mania makes them more creative and resilient.” It may be fine to like Ike during periods of smooth sailing, but Lincoln and a little lunacy are the ticket when seas get rough: “For abnormal challenges,” Ghaemi insists, “abnormal leaders are needed.” The text makes only one reference to the current president, warning us that while “ ‘No drama’ Obama might be considered the epitome of mental health,” we must remember that “psychological moderation” is not the prescription for greatness.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/a-first-rate-madness-by-nassir-ghaemi-book-review.html

Friends are like handkerchiefs: everybody needs them, but the sight of someone asking for one is so mortifyingly vulnerable that you want to avert your eyes from the whole mess. As with handkerchiefs, it’s probably best not to look at friendship too closely, at least until you’ve had it around for a while. We stick with our friends for an entanglement of reasons, and three new picture books, while ostensibly feel-good tales about making friends, turn out to be much closer to the complicated and murky truth than one might guess from their cheery covers.

2011-08-19,Middle School Angst,"Over the course of his amazingly prolific and varied writing career, James Howe, perhaps best known for his “Bunnicula” vampire rabbit series, has established himself as a beloved and elegant voice in children’s literature. The first two of his “Misfits” books — 2001’s “The Misfits” and 2005’s “Totally Joe” — were masterworks of middle school angst, powerful in their ability to impart lessons about difference and empathy in highly readable stories that Disney-jaded preteens could both enjoy and relate to.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/addie-on-the-inside-by-james-howe-book-review.html
2011-08-19,Tales of a Fourth-Grade Something,"At a certain point in our lives something terrific happens — the stops and starts of reading begin to flow and we are able to turn our complete attention to the text itself. For many children at this stage, the familiar rules: they take particular pleasure in reading about someone in a school with routines and structures not unlike their own and enjoy meeting, in a series, their beloved characters again and again. Unconventionally designed books appeal as well — say an ersatz journal filled with just the sorts of notes and sketches the young reader could imagine making herself. Back in 1995, Marissa Moss successfully used all three of these elements in “Amelia’s Notebook.” Now, 23 books later, as her title character makes her way through middle school, she has a series for younger readers, “Daphne’s Diary of Daily Disasters.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/daphnes-diary-of-daily-disasters-by-marissa-moss-book-review.html

For Romeo and Juliet, it’s the murder of Mercutio; for Tony and Maria, it’s the knife fight between Sharks and Jets. This is how tentative adolescent love turns into high drama. Parents don’t object to boyfriends or girlfriends for being taciturn or tattooed.

2011-08-19,Elephants in the Room,"Few creatures can compete with elephants when it comes to being both magnificent and ungainly, but human children, if we’re being honest with ourselves, come close. This sense of distant kinship, plus the fact that trunks are the coolest appendages this side of opposable thumbs, may be why elephants have been a staple of children’s literature since the days of Rudyard Kipling and Jean de Brunhoff. True, they’re not quite so numerous on the bookshelf as bunnies, mice and ducklings, but they outnumber squids by a long shot, and, what with their tree-stump legs, bulky bodies, sail-like ears and those sinuous trunks, elephants are surely more fun for illustrators to draw than just about anything, aside from explosions.

Pier 6 at the south end, near Atlantic Avenue, has its own collection of spots — including Bark and Milk Truck, new this summer — and roof deck seating. Pier 1, at the end of Old Fulton Street, has an outpost of Ditch Plains, a cart from Calexico, Blue Marble ice cream and a wine bar. Open only through Labor Day, the concessions draw crowds of people looking to have a lobster roll, a chipotle pork taco or a glass of prosecco. Sweeping views of the harbor and the skyline are also part of the appeal. On Wednesday afternoon, the crowds included two friends discussing Ghana and microlending.

2011-08-24,Arguments From Personal Incredulity,"Somewhere in his writings Richard Dawkins talks about anti-evolution types who argue from personal incredulity — they say, “I just can’t believe that chance could create something as complex as an eye”, and think that they have scored an important point. All they’ve actually done, of course, is rehash their prejudices. (Simulations show, by the way, that chance plus selection can indeed create an eye, in a relatively short time as evolutionary history goes).",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/arguments-from-personal-incredulity/

2011-08-24,Libya: The End and the Beginning,"For months, almost every development out of Libya seemed to confirm my initial pessimism about our quasi-war against Muammar Qaddafi. But happily that’s changed in the last week, with the sudden collapse of his regime and the apparent victory of the rebels. As in post-Saddam Iraq and post-Taliban Afghanistan, many of the scenarios for what comes next in Libya could ultimately pose as many risks to American interests as Qaddafi himself ever did, and I agree with all the voices pointing out that the tyrant’s fall doesn’t necessarily vindicate our intervention, to say nothing of the dubiously legal means by which America was taken to war in North Africa. But I also think it’s important for critics of the war to acknowledge the significance of the last few days’ events. While few intervention skeptics “maintained that we could not possibly defeat the regime” (as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it), many of us worried that the administration’s (understandably) risk-averse approach to the conflict might create a permanent stalemate, leaving an armed-and-dangerous Qaddafi in power in Tripoli while Western warplanes circled impotently overhead. Qaddafi’s defeat doesn’t necessarily promise a happy outcome in the long run, but at the very least it guarantees that we will be spared that particular worst-case scenario, while holding out the possibility of a Libya unified and at peace — rather than a Libya partitioned and perpetually patrolled by Western forces, which is where we seemed to be headed a month ago. Declarations of victory are ridiculously premature, but for a country and a White House starved for any sort of good news, the fall of Qaddafi should be cause for (suitably restrained) celebration.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/libya-the-end-and-the-beginning/

I think she adored my father, I think she loved sex and it was in the days of no birth control. And the direct result of loving sex is very often having children. She did everything that was required, but I think she would have liked a little more freedom.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/magazine/helen-mirren-the-reluctant-libertine.html

No doubt because of the weather — people had stayed home at “Bedside Baptist,” the pastor joked — Mr. Cassano, gamely dressed in pinstripes, was confronted by empty pews.

Epidemic movies have sidestepped the problem by focusing on the aftermath of a deadly plague, as with “The Omega Man” (1971) and “12 Monkeys” (1995), both set in postapocalyptic wastelands.

Therefore, it seemed only fitting that our mother-daughter trip last month should be to my old stomping, or rather swimming, grounds. Rather than take a nostalgic trip to the top of Michigan’s mitten, I decided we should instead hit what would be virgin territory for me as well and head to the west coast, where I had heard that a half-dozen beach towns could easily be visited in a four-day period, thanks to 170 miles of gentle lakeside highway.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/travel/beach-hopping-along-lake-michigans-eastern-shores.html

For the batter, of course, it’s a game defined by failure most of time, but on a grander scale too our national pastime often seems free of what William James called our “national disease”: the “exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess success.” Failure gives baseball its pleasing, melancholic tang; the boys of summer are always in ruin, after all, and the dirge of the Cubs forever drowns out the anthem of the Yankees. It seems somehow fitting that one of the worst diseases imaginable is named after one of the greatest baseball players. “It breaks your heart,” the former president of Yale and commissioner of Major League Baseball A. Bartlett Giamatti said of the game. “It is designed to break your heart.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/essay-a-baseball-classic-comes-off-the-bench-by-matt-weiland.html

2011-08-26,The Enigma of Joseph Heller,"“Oh God, this is a calamity for American literature,” Kurt Vonnegut said on learning of Joseph Heller’s death in 1999. John Updike was less alarmed: Heller “wasn’t top of the chart” as a writer, he reflected, though he was “a sweet man” and his first novel, “Catch-22” was “important.” Note the Updikean judiciousness of “important”: he didn’t say he liked the book, but it was a great cultural bellwether as novels go, and it has endured. Despite mixed reviews on publication in 1961, “Catch-22” was soon adopted by college students who recognized a kindred spirit in Yossarian, the bombardier who rebels against a materialistic bureaucracy hellbent on killing him. “Better Yossarian than Rotarian” became a popular slogan, all the more so with the timely (for the novel’s sake) military escalation in Vietnam, which became the “real” subject of “Catch-22” and partly accounts for its sales of more than 10 million copies to date.

He is the editor of a glossy highbrow magazine called Letras Libres. There are corners of the Spanish-speaking universe in which he is omnipresent, and even a few corners of the English-speaking universe in which his byline is hard to miss. I have been following his work for decades. I subscribe to his magazine. Occasionally I contribute to it. He has always seemed to me a keen and judicious political observer, worldly and instinctively liberal.

Simplicity of line is prized, extraneous detail discouraged. Although Julie Otsuka was born and raised in California and trained as a painter in the Western tradition, she seems perfectly attuned to the spirit of sumi-e. Otsuka claims to have been a failure as an artist, but she might only have erred in choosing the wrong medium. Proof arrived almost a decade ago, long after she’d traded painting for writing, with the publication of her first novel, “When the Emperor Was Divine,” a spare but resonant portrait of one Japanese-­American family’s daily life, at home and in the internment camps, during World War II.

I wrote an obituary for Hedwig the owl,” Kois wrote recently in The Times Magazine. Indeed, his Potter-mania once threatened “to overtake my ability to function as a grown human being.” So he seemed a natural choice to review Lev Grossman’s latest novel, “The Magician King,” the second in a series often described as a “Harry Potter” for grown-ups.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/up-front-dan-kois.html

During the high season, which runs from May to October, it’s one big seafood banquet: oysters, clams, mussels, halibut, lobsters, haddock, salmon and scallops are all on the menu, and all from just down the road. The seafood used to hit your plate deep fried beyond recognition, but these days your fish could come grilled, your steamers actually steamed. Last month, my husband, our 1-year-old son and I set off in search of fishy stuff and found plenty, along with a few other simple summer pleasures, like the local classic-rock radio station (hello, Queen!).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/a-fish-tale/

2011-08-26,Inside the List," MAN BITES GOD: “God, No!,” new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list, isn’t a reaction to the news that George R. R. Martin has decided to abandon his “Song of Ice and Fire” series and take up extreme knitting instead. Rather, it’s a profanity-laced memoir-cum-manifesto from the magician and outspoken atheist Penn Jillette, the taller and louder half of Penn & Teller. The book is structured around Jillette’s alternatives to the Ten Commandments (take the Lord’s name in vain all you want, but be sure to “say what you mean, even when talking to yourself”), but we also get reminiscences about his moderately Congregationalist childhood in Massachusetts, his conflicted admiration for Siegfried and Roy, and the “atheist baptisms” held at his Las Vegas home, the Slammer, which tend to involve lots of bacon, “nude cornstarch wrestling” and a fat Elvis impersonator. We also learn some good post-show lobby pickup lines: he laughed hardest at the woman who asked, “Is your name Debbie?” but married the one who started talking about Richard Dawkins. As for their children, his wife may be Jewish (or, as he puts it, a nonbeliever whose forebears happened to be Jewish), but “they are atheist and their culture is Vegas — and even that’s too much tribalism for me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2011-08-29,The Jam | Marianne Faithfull,"The legendary English singer-songwriter Marianne Faithfull, who is also an actress, presents us with her playlist this week. “It’s heavy in the cornerstone classics of music,” says the Jam‘s curator, Sean Hanratty, of the list, which includes Leonard Cohen and the Clash. “It’s full of the timeless stuff that you never really lose, the records you own and would never part with.” Faithfull’s first hit, “As Tears Go By” (1964), which Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham helped write, remains one of the best ballads of all time. The song, along with her highly publicized relationship with Jagger, put her on the map as one of rock’s biggest stars. “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” on the Stones album “Let It Bleed,” released in 1969, was one of many songs written about Faithfull. “I think some people forget — certainly not me — that she also co-wrote ‘Sister Morphine,’ ” says Hanratty of the track on the Stones’s 1971 “Sticky Fingers” album. (The song is reportedly about her life and battles with drug abuse, specifically heroin.) For the past five decades, we have seen Faithfull reinvent herself as a performer and musician, in collaborations with the likes of David Bowie, Tom Waits, Emmylou Harris, Nick Cave and others, while keeping her place as one of the most influential female singer-songwriters of all time. “With the impending hurricane and Virginia’s earthquake, we are kind of in need of the classics,” Hanratty says. Faithfull will perform her classics, as well as songs from this year’s album, “Horses and High Heels,” at Manhattan’s City Winery on Dec. 18.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/the-jam-marianne-faithfull/

2011-08-30,Good Soles,"Steven Tiller, a co-founder of the retro SoCal sneaker brand SeaVees, was driving to work recently when he heard on NPR that the 50th anniversary of the Peace Corps was coming up.

Sensing an opportunity right in line with SeaVees’s revisionist design philosophy and midcentury aesthetic, Tiller and his business partner, Derek Galkin, began sifting through old photos of Peace Corps volunteers. On their feet? Narrow plimsolls, a common canvas and rubber sneaker for that era. “The idea was to go back in time, reimagine these shoes and hopefully make them cooler,” Tiller said. The resulting slim-lined sneaker in salt-washed canvas has a contrast suede stripe around its rims and a distinct vintage look.

Accordingly, Mattout’s latest men’s collection — all jodhpur-style chinos, leather elbow patches and whipcord wool blazers in dragoon red — is a paean to his horse-loving hometown. But rather than reboot some bygone vision of aristo chic, Mattout drew on his design experience at Dior Homme, Dunhill and Victorinox.
