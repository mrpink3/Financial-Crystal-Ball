One, it was created by arguably TV’s most revered auteur at the time, Aaron Sorkin, who was more-or-less fresh off “The West Wing,” a paragon of snappy-pattered, makes-you-feel-smart-just-for-watching television. Two, “Studio 60″ was about comedy: specifically, late-night comedy and, presumably, “Saturday Night Live.” (“Studio 60″ was the name of a fictional, live, late-night sketch-comedy show produced out of Los Angeles.) Third, in a weird coincidence, “Studio 60″ premiered the same year, on the same network, as the similarly numerically titled “30 Rock,” which is also sort-of about “Saturday Night Live” and is written by the ex-“S.N.L.” head writer Tina Fey.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/the-ghost-and-cult-of-studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/

The article makes a nice pairing with another recent Foreign Affairs piece by Michael Scott Doran, which takes Iran and Syria seriously as a kind of “anticolonialist” bloc single-mindedly focused on undermining the United States. It is perhaps a slightly paranoid or excited piece, but it is paranoid about something that the United States, as a noncolonial and indeed anticolonial power, habitually underestimates in its foreign policy, namely the enduring political power of anticolonial feeling in a post-colonial world.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/how-hot-will-the-arab-summer-be/

I’ve done it many times myself. Depending on whom you talk to, that might be a type of sour or it might be a type of fix, but it almost certainly is not a gimlet. A proper gimlet is made with lime cordial. And what most of the world knows as lime cordial is Rose’s, that dusty, fluorescent yellow-green bottle in the drinks section of your supermarket. I am willing to bet that at some point in its very long history Mr. Lauchlin Rose’s Cordial Mixer Lime Juice may have been a bracing product, redolent of the fruit that it promises. Sadly, its current incarnation is to limes as Spam is to steak. It tastes of the high-fructose corn syrup, stabilizers and various chemicals that give it its cesium-like shelf life, which is all fine for Cadbury, which has owned the brand since 1981, but is bitter gruel for someone trying to tap into the sublimity of a true gimlet.

2011-05-02,Linked In | Hoorsenbuhs,"When the 1941 Quonset hut that housed Hoorsenbuhs’s Santa Monica atelier was scheduled for demolition, the first reaction of the fine jewelry line’s founders, Robert Keith and Kether Parker, was resistance; after all, the iron structure’s rustic feel was the perfect complement to Keith’s opulent industrial designs, favored by style savvy celebs like David Beckham, Katie Holmes, Mary Kate Olsen and Rihanna. But soon the two men, who became fast friends on a Malibu beach 20 years ago and started Hoorsenbuhs in 2005, decided that an upgrade was in order. The new private showroom opened this week in a former bungalow on Santa Monica’s Main Street, with fittings from the old space, like dark wood sliding doors, industrial lamps and jewelry cases offset with heavy maritime chains. (The Hoorsenbuhs name comes from a Dutch trading ship sailed by Keith’s ancestors.).

2011-05-03,On the Ground with a ‘Gap Year’,"I’ve periodically recommended that high school students take a “gap year” after graduation, by deferring college entrance for one year. Most colleges encourage students to take a gap year, partly because students then arrive a little more mature, a little more ready to study, a little more worldly. It’s becoming a bit more common, and Princeton now pays for some kids to travel during their gap year, but most people are still wary of the idea. In fact, almost every kid I’ve talked to who has taken a gap year raves about the idea, so I thought I’d commission a guest column from my eldest son, Gregory, who is currently taking a gap year in China. He spent most of the year studying Chinese at Tsinghua University and then at a language school in Dalian, and soon he’s going to finish up the year studying Spanish in Peru. On the side, he worked and volunteered. Here’s his take:",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/on-the-ground-with-a-gap-year/
2011-05-03,Now Renting | Traveling Coffee Bar,"The quest for the perfect cup of organic fair-trade Sumatran coffee can take you far afield (or at least off the island of Manhattan). But why travel when Melissa Knott of Grounded Coffee Catering will bring her coffee bar to you? Knott will journey anywhere in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania where there’s a dedicated electrical outlet and “four clear feet of space” for her folding table and portable Pasquini espresso machine. Along with filter coffee and espresso drinks — including a fantastic decaf — Knott offers loose-leaf black and herbal teas, hot chocolate (made with dairy, soy or coconut milk) and Italian sodas, all organic and fair-trade. She works with a local roaster to create custom blends and has them specially roasted for each event she caters. Since founding her business three and a half years ago, Knott has pulled shots and poured cups everywhere from suburban pool parties to the set of a slasher film on Governors Island. Her dedication to coffee — she wrote her thesis on it — is such that she even checks the water quality of an area before heading out. “I actually prefer to bring my own,” she says. “If the water’s too hard or too soft it really affects the taste of the coffee.” For more on Grounded Coffee Catering, including information on the farmers’ markets where Knott sells her custom roasted beans, go to groundedcatering.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/now-renting-traveling-coffee-bar/

Yet he couldn’t conjure up enough magic to secure a Tony nomination on Tuesday for a performance that excited many theatergoers and critics, making him one of the most glaring snubs of the morning. Did Tony nominators agree with Ben Brantley, who wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Radcliffe “is clearly not to the musical manner born.” Or was Mr. Radcliffe simply the victim of an evil spell cast by Severus Snape?

And I discovered the so-called “Commonwealth Song.” It’s not so much a song as it is an extended improvisation during the interminable “Get Back” studio sessions in 1969 (in fact, some theorize that “The Commonwealth Song” is a prototype for “Get Back”). “Commonwealth” name-checks Enoch Powell (the Tom Tancredo of his day, or Thilo Sarazin, if you prefer a German reference), who had delivered his anti-immigrant “Rivers of Blood” speech the previous year. “Commonwealth” was Paul McCartney’s mocking response. All of which shows that the sun never sets on some issues. It’s also nice to know that as late as 1969, Lennon and McCartney could still crack each other up, especially when John interjects his high-pitched “Yes!”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/the-beatles-discuss-arizonas-immigration-bill/

2011-05-05,Asked & Answered | Pierre Thoretton,"In the past few years, there have been a number of documentaries about iconic fashion designers, from the critically acclaimed “Valentino: The Last Emperor” to the wayward “Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston.” But none seems as delicately composed and poignant as Pierre Thoretton’s “L’Amour Fou,” which had its United States premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and will be out in theaters on May 13. Thoretton hangs the film on the spectacular $480 million art collection that the French-Algerian couturier Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé, amassed during their 50 years together and its symbolism for the love they had for one another. Still it’s hard not to wonder if it was Bergé, as much as Thoretton, who called the shots in the film much as he did in Saint Laurent’s life and image. Here, the 43-year-old French director discusses the crazy love between the two men and the filmmaking techniques he chose to tell the story.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/asked-answered-pierre-thoretton/

That this didn’t happen might have marked the moment when things started to go wrong. Or maybe that was when Johnny Carson retired.

Fans mobbed the barricades to get a closer look at the lead singer, Lovefoxxx (pictured here). Dressed in a sequined bolero ensemble and Doc Martens boots, she turned cartwheels and surfed the crowd. The audience read like a throng of exultant misfits, gathered to hail their beloved leaders. Lovefoxxx gave a shout-out to someone watching that night, who had written the band an e-mail explaining how they had inspired him to come out and be honest about who he was with his family and friends, and later she brought several teenage girls to the stage to dance alongside her.

The task of sorting out his estate was left to his two children, Rainer and Flavin, who persevered against what many considered insurmountable odds, resulting in the creation of the now seemingly solid Judd Foundation. Judd’s daughter, Rainer, is the president of the board of the foundation and the more public of the two while his son, Flavin, is vice president (but referred to himself as the “curatorial consultant”). Despite being very involved in the day-to-day running of the foundation, he remains relatively out of the public eye. T recently caught up with Flavin Judd, who was in town to oversee the installation of a major exhibit of his father’s work at David Zwirner gallery. “Donald Judd,” which opens on Friday, features nine aluminum boxes originally shown in a 1989 exhibition at Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden.

This is not a rhetorical question but rather an expression of genuine puzzlement occasioned by “Something Borrowed,” a well-meaning comedy of marriage that seems ardently committed to the blandness of its characters. The principal would-be couple (one of whom is engaged to someone else) consists of Dex (Colin Egglesfield) and Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin). They are pleasant and nice looking and utterly without distinguishing features. Watching them flirt and kiss and bicker is like witnessing the passionate romance between a canned Bartlett pear and a cube of tofu — a handsomely chiseled cube of tofu, to be sure, and a perfectly sweet pear, but still.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/movies/something-borrowed-with-ginnifer-goodwin-review.html

2011-05-06,Asked & Answered | Eric Goode,"A handful of nightclubs have achieved legendary status and are symbolic of the excesses and revelry of the decade. The 1970s had Studio 54, of course, and the ’90s are synonymous with the club-kid shenanigans of the Limelight. Nothing exemplified the art boom of the go-go ’80s and the cross-breeding of uptown and downtown like Area. Located on a quiet Hudson Street factory block, when TriBeCa was an out-of-the way ghost town, Area was equal parts conceptual installation, fun house and disco. Every six weeks or so, the outlandish theme would change — and we’re not talking about using balloons instead of streamers. The indoor pool would morph from, say, “Sports” to “Bikers,” featuring actual bikers and beyond. What nightclub in today’s atmosphere of bottle service and a Lady Gaga soundtrack would actually have an art department?",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/asked-answered-eric-goode/

2011-05-06,Pawlenty Hopes ‘I’m Sorry’ Is Enough,"It’s a question every candidate faces: how to deal with political liabilities.

He seemed like a quiet, polite, regular child — with curly hair and a shy smile, trying bravely to absorb the change in his life — and so he was, until he took off.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/magazine/mag-08lives-t.html
2011-05-06,The Return of Ric Ocasek,"When I saw that the Cars were touring and had a new album, “Move Like This,” I thought of what Frank Black said when he was asked why the Pixies were reuniting: “I did the arty-farty part, and now it’s time to talk about the money.” Is that true for the Cars?  I don’t think so. Money is great if it comes along, but when we first talked about it, we were going to just do a record for the Internet. We really didn’t want to do the fanfare thing or the “Hey, we’re back and we’re going to show you what the ’80s were like” thing. I wrote all these songs and then just out of the blue one night thought that, Gee, maybe I’ll call the guys and see if they want to do this.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/magazine/mag-08Talk-t.html
2011-05-06,Block Quote: Susan Sontag Makes the Case for Not Owning a Camera,"New Boston Review: Why did you decide to write about photography?Susan Sontag: Because I’ve had the experience of being obsessed by photographs. And because virtually all the important aesthetic, moral and political problems — the question of “modernity” itself and of “modernist” taste — are played out in photography’s relatively brief history. William K. Ivins has called the camera the most important invention since the printing press. For the evolution of sensibility, the invention of the camera is perhaps even more important. It is, of course, the uses to which photography is put in our culture, in the consumer society, that make photography so interesting and so potent. In the People’s Republic of China, people don’t see “photographically.” The Chinese take pictures of each other and of famous sites and monuments, as we do. But they’re baffled by the foreigner who will rush to take a picture of an old, battered, peeling farmhouse door. They don’t have our idea of the “picturesque.” They don’t understand photography as a method of appropriating and transforming reality — in pieces — which denies the very existence of inappropriate or unworthy subject matter. As a current ad for the Polaroid SX-70 puts it: “It won’t let you stop. Suddenly you see a picture everywhere you look.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/magazine/mag-08Riffsidebar-t.html
2011-05-06,"On (Digital) Photography: Sontag, 34 Years Later","A while ago, a botched laptop sync wiped out all the pictures on my iPhone, consigning to oblivion 18 months of poorly framed vacation snapshots, blurred portraits of my children and candid, accidental glimpses of my feet. I should have downloaded it all earlier, winnowing as I went, but somehow I have never acquired that habit. Until I got that phone, I was never much of a photographer, so I’ve always depended on others — grandfathers, my mother, my father-in-law and especially my intermittently camera-obsessed wife — to keep me surrounded by images.

2011-05-06,"Paris, With Hot Sauce","In a city dominated by coq au vin and rillettes, authentic Mexican food — let alone a good margarita — has been hard to come by. Now there is Candelaria, Paris’s first real taqueria, which recently opened in the Marais. The galley-size kitchen, helmed by the Mexican chef Luis Rendon, is buffered by a five-seat counter and a communal table. The seasonal menu, listed on a jagged blackboard, currently includes dishes like rajas con queso (tacos with sautéed green peppers, onions and melted cheese), totopos (chips) with zesty guacamole and longaniza (spicy pork) or pollo pibil (stewed chicken) tostados dressed with shredded red cabbage. The crisp tortillas are made in-house with meseca imported from Spain. Spicy sauces are on hand — and thankfully so are Mexican beers, bubbly fluorescent Jarritos sodas and hibiscus juice. There’s no wine or coffee — positively heresy in Paris — but here “nothing has been compromised for a French palate,” insists Carina Soto Velasquez, who founded the restaurant with Adam Tsou and Joshua Fontaine. And about those margaritas? Hidden behind a mural-covered door in the back is a cocktail bar whose alcoholic arsenal includes well-aged tequilas, organic mezcal, rare rums and a curated drink selection with contributions from international bartender aficionados. (One is from the provenance of the East Village’s Death & Co.) Assorted young artists helped supply the décor, including Adrian Rubi-Dentzel, who repurposed the space’s original floor into the bar, and Confetti System, whose shimmering pendant adds a nice flourish.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/paris-with-hot-sauce/

What links these places is not just fashion, but the design process itself and how the ideas of designers evolve over time. That evolution is one of the pleasures of Andrew Bolton’s selections for the McQueen show, especially in the tailoring choices. It was inspiring to see how his cutting methods changed over his career, yet how certain assumptions remained fixed. One of the most rewarding and maddening of these assumptions is that design is a learning process. And McQueen always wanted to learn.

If so, Mr. Irons, a star of the Showtime series “The Borgias” (not to mention films like “Reversal of Fortune” and “The Lion King”) will get to fulfill that goal in a one-night concert production of “Camelot” for the Irish Repertory Theater, in which he will play King Arthur. Press representatives for the production, which will be presented on June 6 at the Shubert Theater, said on Friday that Mr. Irons will play Arthur, the Excalibur-wielding monarch, in the Lerner and Loewe musical. James Barbour and Melissa Errico will play Lancelot and Guenevere, reprising the roles they played in a 2005 production at the Hollywood Bowl. The Irish Rep concert production, which will be directed by Charlotte Moore, with musical direction by Mark Hartman, will be presented as a benefit for the theater, so be prepared to dig up a little more coin of the realm for tickets.

The yacht holds a basketball court, a movie theater and a fully equipped recording studio, complete with killer ocean views, that has allowed him to rub shoulders with the fabulous — Mick Jagger, Bono, Paul McCartney and a long list of Page Six names that populate this memoir. “One of the greatest creative minds in the world of technology,” writes Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seahawks and therefore an Allen employee, in a blurb gracing the book’s back cover.

2011-05-06,A Memoir of Living Off the Grid,"Melissa Coleman’s father, Eliot, once suggested that evidence points to “the return to the land as a cyclical urge in history.” Some families work the land out of necessity, while others seek “the good life” through labor and simplicity. In the 1840s, Thoreau took to the woods to “live deliberately.” During the Great Depression, self-sufficiency was raised to new importance, and well-educated men like the writer and editor Elliott Merrick and the economist Ralph Borsodi found homesteading a rational and intellectual pursuit. The political climate of the late 1960s (and later the energy crisis of the ’70s) provoked back-to-the-land desires in many, including Eliot Coleman, who, inspired by Helen and Scott Nearing’s book “Living the Good Life,” moved in 1968 with his pregnant wife, Sue, to a remote 60-acre wood in coastal Maine. There, they developed sustainable, small-scale farming techniques that would help catalyze the organic movement.

Not so for Lily Mandelbaum, a student at N.Y.U. who has collaborated with her mother, the fashion editor and stylist Elisa Goodkind, on the style blog Stylelikeu since 2008. The popular site features closet tours, style mantras and video interviews with their fashion muses, both known (the fashion designer LaQuan Smith) and unknown (Virginie Sommet, who makes art out of Indian candy and fennel). Now, just in time for Mother’s Day, they’ve released a book of the same name, full of beautiful images of sartorial inspiration, including collages of hands garnished with jaw-dropping gems, club kids posing in their bedrooms and little old ladies who refuse to hang up the toreador pants. As Tziporah Salamon, one such senior, happily explained: “Every single day you get a chance to invent yourself.

2011-05-09,A Matter of Degrees,"In 1940, a Brooklyn woman named Jean Kay filed a suit with the State Supreme Court against the her city’s Board of Higher Education claiming that the renowned mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell was morally unfit to teach at the City College of New York, where he had been offered a professorship. Kay, supported by a host of others in the public scrum, including Bishop William Manning of the Episcopal Church, argued that Russell, who advocated sex before marriage and other heretical lifestyle choices, posed a threat to the virtue of her daughter — even though the impressionable youth was not actually a student at the college. A judge ruled in Kay’s favor. Russell, who was not allowed to speak in his own defense, was denied his appointment at the college, which was, and is, part of the publicly financed City University of New York system. Today, the now-notorious incident is chronicled in an exhibition on City College’s Web site, called “The Struggle for Free Speech at CCNY, 1931-1942,” as is a recounting of the subsequent firings, spurred by the McCarthy era Rapp-Coudert Committee, of faculty members accused of being Communist Party members.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/a-matter-of-degrees/

A whole field of bands gravitated toward intense polyphony, liturgical melodies and the clank: drummers playing roughed-up rhythm, rushing time and forestalling your pleasure, vexing you on purpose.

This raised the question of whether there had been interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals, an issue that is still not resolved.",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/science/10neanderthal.html

Israel delayed the transfer of almost $90 million after the reconciliation last week between Fatah, the party that dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. Israel said it was suspending all such transfers until there were guarantees that none of the money would end up in the treasury of Hamas, which is sworn to Israel’s destruction. The Palestinian Authority has had financial difficulties since late last year and is running a monthly deficit of $30 million. The French government provided it with a special grant of $14.3 million on Monday. On Friday, the European Union said it would advance $121.9 million to help it meet its needs.

Some Hindus believe that the same spot is the birthplace of the god Ram, and that Babur had destroyed a Hindu shrine to build his mosque. In 1992, Hindu activists tore down the mosque, unleashing sectarian violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. In October a court ruled that the site should be split between the two religions, but the Supreme Court rejected that solution, calling it “strange.” The Supreme Court is expected to rule later on the question of how to resolve control of the site.

In a winking style more reminiscent of “The Muppet Show” than “Sesame Street,” Kermit is introduced to “Pirates” stars like Geoffrey Rush, Penélope Cruz and Johnny Depp (who appears baffled by the concept of a talking frog), mingles with stray guests like Steven Tyler and Bruno Tonioli, and steals kisses from Vanessa Hudgens and Kirstie Alley. (Miss Piggy might want to skip those scenes.) Yes, it’s all a promotion for a coming Disney-produced Muppets movie, and while we would have preferred to see Gonzo introduced to Keith Richards, Kermit’s brief encounter with that randy Rolling Stone is still worth the price of admission.

The farm harvests without chemicals, feeds its employees (“Raw oysters, fried oysters, oyster risotto, a lot of oysters!” Péan says) and turns the shells into beads. Péan’s line uses Kamoka’s keshi pearls in hues of blue, aubergine and gold for pieces like a ring set with delicate pavé-diamond tendrils (conflict-free, of course), which Péan says was inspired by Ahe’s “pollution-free midnight sky reflecting against the waves and the light.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/pearl-vision/

She put the plan into action for the first time on Monday night, when the Mercer Street shop was the site of an installation by the artist Orly Genger, who’s known for knotting thick nylon climbing rope into massive, room-filling shapes and who has collaborated with Bartlett on installations for her runway shows and also on accessories. “Squat,” as the new piece is called, has an unusual twist: For the duration of the event, it incorporated two live models, both clad in VPL underwear. “The idea was to have it look like something had blown through like a tornado and swept up against the window, engulfing the girls,” Bartlett explained as she surveyed the scene. “It’s this enormous muscle of rope that’s come crashing through the store.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/fashion-with-a-twist-orly-genger-at-vpl/

The Environmental Assessment Commission of Coyhaique, a regional government commission in southern Chile, approved on Monday the $3.2 billion project, which involves a series of five dams in the sparsely populated region of Aysén, which is dotted with nature reserves. Government officials say the HidroAysén project is needed to help stave off an energy squeeze in Chile, which imports about 70 percent of its energy. Environmentalists say it will flood thousands of acres of largely undeveloped territory and damage ranching and tourism. The police arrested at least 60 people late Monday in Santiago at a downtown protest that attracted thousands. Hundreds of demonstrators also took to the streets in at least four other Chilean cities.

The Alaskan Palin fought corruption within her own party, attacked the nexus of government and big business, avoided polarizing feuds and cut successful bipartisan deals; in the process, Green notes, “she succeeded to a remarkable extent in settling, at least for a time, what had seemed insoluble problems, in the process putting Alaska on a trajectory to financial well-being.” This was the Palin that I liked from afar, before John McCain elevated her to national prominence: The charismatic pro-life working mom who was also a good-government reformer capable of thinking outside the ideological box. (Imagine Mitch Daniels crossed with Michelle Bachmann — in a good way.)

When Fred Krehbiel, a Chicago industrialist, decided to buy Ballyfin, a Georgian manor on 600 acres in Ireland’s County Laois, the property was being used as a school, he says, “and we had to give them six years to build a new building.” During that time, Krehbiel’s team of more than 100 workers began transforming the 1812 mansion into a hotel with 15 rooms, all while working around 500 teenagers. Krehbiel and crew restored ornate plasterwork, bought back some of the previous owner’s paintings, rebuilt the conservatory (which had to be disassembled and shipped to England for repairs) and even uncovered a Roman sarcophagus bathtub, now installed in one of the guest rooms. (Appropriately, a family motto of Ballyfin’s original owner, Sir Charles Coote, was “coûte que coûte” — “cost what it may.”)",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/this-old-hotel/

(Ms. Jolie, who plays a tigress, hedged an answer. “I do feel if we had a male director, I would have had a bigger part,” Mr. Hoffman – red panda – said jokingly.)

Officials said the woman, who identified herself as Abeer Fakhri, 25, was a Coptic Christian who had left her Christian husband for a Muslim man and sought to convert to Islam. When the Muslim man and about 20 other men arrived at the church where he believed she was being held, sectarian street battles erupted. Ms. Fakhri, who has done television interviews, said church authorities had detained her while they encouraged her not to convert. She said she called her Muslim boyfriend, who called the police, but when an officer called she was afraid to speak to him. Her account could not be confirmed. The Coptic Church forbids divorce, and reports of Coptic women converting to end a marriage are common. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/world/africa/13briefs-egypt.html
2011-05-13,France: Terrorism Charges Dropped Against Iranian Group," The French authorities are dropping terrorism charges against 24 members of an Iranian dissident group for lack of evidence,  court documents show, nearly eight years after a sensational raid on the organization’s headquarters amid charges that the group was planning attacks in Europe. The police arrested 120 people in the raid on the offices of the group, the People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, which wants to overthrow the Iranian government, in a Paris suburb in 2003. Most were released, but 24 people were held on terrorism or terrorism-financing charges. The authorities said the organization had been plotting to attack Iranian embassies and assassinate former members working with Iranian intelligence services in Europe. In a ruling dated Wednesday, the investigating judges found that there were no grounds for proceeding with indictments for terrorism or terrorism financing. The group’s lawyer, William Bourdon, said the judges based their decision partly on “a legitimate right to resist tyranny,” as well as the fact that there was no evidence that the group had ever been responsible for attacks on civilians. Nine members of the group remain under investigation for financial wrongdoing. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/world/europe/13briefs-France.html

Increasingly, modern historians have come to regard that bleak November “armistice” as a mere truce in a long, terrible conflict that almost sent civilization into total eclipse and that did not really terminate until the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany after November 1989. Even that might be an optimistic reading: the post-1918 frontiers of the former Ottoman Empire (one of the four great thrones that did not outlast the “First” World War) are still a suppurating source of violence and embitterment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/books/review/book-review-to-end-all-wars-by-adam-hochschild.html

2011-05-13,Rock Star Tunes in to the Elders of the Tribe,"SINCE 2006, when Arctic Monkeys appeared on the British music scene, Alex Turner, the frontman, has been acclaimed as a songwriter wise beyond his years. (He was 20 when the group hit it big, thanks in part to the tendency of the British press to trumpet and acclaim.) Through lineup changes and side projects, and a recent foray in New York with his girlfriend, Alexa Chung, the MTV personality and Madewell designer, Mr. Turner has gravitated toward classic musicians, like Gene Clark of the Byrds, and films like the 1959 western “Rio Bravo.” His retro sensibility is evident on the band’s fourth album, “Suck It and See” (Domino), to be released June 6. The title seems cheeky but it’s not, Mr. Turner said. “It’s an old Britishism, like a bit Dick van Dyke-y, like ‘give it a try’ almost — it’d be a slogan for some candy,” he said. “That’s not really traveled very well.” In a conversation peppered with other Britishisms (“nice one, love” he said, often, alongside saucier phrases) he recently spoke with Melena Ryzik from Stockholm, where the band members were starting their tour, performing together for the first time in over a year. “I’m a bit nervous, to be honest with you,” Mr. Turner said. “I have just opened a beer, actually. We’ll see if that’s going to help it out. I don’t want to do too much of that. I’m worried I might become forgetful, and there’s a lot of words in our songs.” Here are excerpts from their conversation.

All of this left her feeling, understandably, sluggish, until she adopted the Metabolic Balance Diet. “It’s this German diet. They take your blood and they analyze your hormone levels, vitamin levels, what’s right for you, your body type, your height, your weight. They analyze everything and give you this big list of what you can and cannot eat,” Kidd explained while previewing her summer and fall collections. “But the main rules are one type of protein for each meal, you’ve got to wait five hours between each meal, no snacking, an apple a day. The first thing you eat should be protein — it’s all about leveling your blood sugar and your hormones. Weight loss is the third thing. It’s detox for the first two weeks — you’re not allowed any fat. I’ve lost 23 pounds since January, 15 of them in the first 10 days.” The svelte Kidd was in New York a couple of weeks ago for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala (she wore McQueen), where she was privy to some testimonials to one of her Target products, Show Stopper Year-Round Body Glow. “It’s organically grown into quite a successful little product,” she said. “I had five people at the Met ball come up to me and say, ‘My makeup artist put it on me. It’s fabulous!’”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/vain-glorious-jemma-kidds-secrets-to-a-brilliant-body/

2011-05-16,Southern Swell,"Now that Costa Rica’s best breaks have been overrun, Nicaragua is luring wave riders with low-key surf camps and undiscovered beaches. Popoyo, on the southern Pacific coast, has the most consistent barrel, along with hotels like the Popoyo Beach Lodge (popoyobeachlodge.com; doubles from $55 ). But two and a half hours north of Managua and just west of the town of Chinandega lies the country’s undeveloped northern Pacific coast — and dozens of breaks so new that many don’t have names. This is where the pro surfer and model Holly Beck set up her camp, Suave Dulce (surfwithhollybeck.com) after she stopped competing in 2008. Nicaragua, says Beck, a California native, is the ideal place to “help people experience the joy of getting pushed by the ocean.” Many of Beck’s students stay at El Coco Loco (011-505-8999-8662; elcocolocoresort.com; doubles from $100), a rustic resort near the town of Santa Maria del Mar with five palm-thatch cabanas near several surf spots. La Bahia Beach Hodel (011-505-8958-5075; labahiabeachhotel.com; doubles from $150) is a more luxurious option: four stone-and-teak casitas with outdoor showers, private pathways to one of Nicaragua’s most beautiful beaches and three breaks in front of the hotel (with more nearby). Both resorts serve seafood delivered daily by local fishermen, and there’s also plenty of the local catch at Al Cielo (011-505-8993-4840), a popular open-air palapa run by two French guys, with 360-degree views.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/southern-swell/

At least a dozen groups give surfing lessons, among them Jo Moraiz (011-33-6-62-76-17-24; jomoraiz.com), France’s first surf school. Biarritz’s plushest beach hotel is the Hôtel Du Palais (011-33-5-59-41-64-00; hotel-du-palais.com; doubles from about $665), a palace-turned-hotel where Alain Ducasse worked one of his first kitchen jobs.

Officials were trying to “find a future for the festival,” including a new orchestra, he said. The festival was founded in 1967 by the Philharmonic’s conductor, Herbert von Karajan, as a place for it to play opera. The decision to move to Baden-Baden follows a financial scandal that led to allegations of fraud against two former officials. In explaining the move, a Philharmonic spokesman, Olaf Maninger, said, “We need the kind of long-term security that the Baden-Baden Festspielhaus has to offer,” according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Riegler said the orchestra wanted to expand its offerings beyond the two opera performances, six concerts and handful of chamber music performances it has been giving in Salzburg. “We don’t have the money for it, and Baden-Baden seems to have,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/arts/music/salzburg-must-replace-berlin-philharmonic.html

2011-05-17,"Sex, the Koch Brothers and Academic Freedom","More than a few of the respondents to my column about CUNY’s on-again-off-again-on-again awarding of an honorary degree to Tony Kushner say that while I may be correct about the “technical” definition of academic freedom, I miss the larger point. That’s because there isn’t one. A board of trustees with every right to make a decision made it in a way that (a) ran counter to its previous practice (b) permitted a single member (Jeffrey Wiesenfeld) to derail a process that had seemed to be on a familiar track and (c) put CUNY right in the middle of the briar patch called the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Maladroit, unfortunate and (as I said) dumb. But that’s it. It was just the board screwing up with the predictable public-relations disaster as the result. No one’s freedom was curtailed, no one’s speech was censored, no harm, except to the board’s reputation and by extension to CUNY’s, was done.Because Wiesenfeld’s objections were to Kushner’s views on Israel, the uproar that followed the board’s decision to table his nomination quickly escalated into a shouting match between those who said that Israel was engaged in ethnic cleansing and those who replied that people who said that were anti-Semites and/or self-hating Jews. The responses to my column followed the same pattern. No one wanted to hear the topic of academic freedom “parsed” (a word used in derision by one reader, as if parsing something, trying to get it right, were a crime). MSP Shiloh complained that “Dr. Fish misdirects our attention to the arcane and off topic of the academic honorary degree process,” when “[t]his was, and is, about Israel’s persecution” of Palestinians. Other respondents were just as sure that “this was, and is, about” a university honoring a “self–righteous hack” (mcghostoflectricity) who spews “current day Palestinian propaganda” (neilrobert). Both sides are wrong, not about Israel – I did not and will not come down on that issue — but about what “this” is about. It’s about institutional ineptness, a relatively small matter that nevertheless can teach us some lessons. The back-and-forth trading of ritual insults is hardly edifying, but a proper understanding of what academic freedom is might be.

That has led to a large collection of scores — some 500 — that Harvard University has just received. The family of Solti, who died in 1997, donated the collection to the Loeb Music Library at Harvard, university officials said on Tuesday. “They are the most heavily marked-up scores I have ever seen,” said Virginia Danielson, the Loeb’s librarian, and a source of valuable insight into Solti’s musical thinking.

A surfer now is more likely to be riding a board he made himself, often a radically new shape.

In his words, there are three essential steps: “to try new things, in the expectations that some will fail; to make failure survivable, because it will be common; and to make sure that you know when you’ve failed.” It sort of seems like common sense, but the book’s wealth of fascinating case studies shows just how uncommon and difficult it often is for people and institutions to follow such a program.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/adaptive-bombshells/

For 15 years, Ivan Pericoli and Benoît Astier de Villatte have been creating furniture and wonderfully goopy, overglazed ceramics which they sell from their charming shop on the rue Saint Honoré. But when the two set out to create a new collection of candles, they broadened their horizons, following their noses — in their imaginations, at least — to far flung places like Brasilia and Kobe. Of the 20 different destination-oriented scents, created in collaboration with the fragrance company Takasago, some might seem vaguely familiar: Naples, for example, is a bouquet of “almond, orange blossom, and Ylang-Ylang, lightened by a refreshing touch of petitgrain and neroli.” Alcatraz, on the other hand (“Indian blond tobacco, yerba maté with its notes of dried hay, smoked lignum vitae and cinnamon spiced with black pepper”) seems to have been conjured not from an actual three-hour tour but a dream. And what is the smell of home?

2011-05-19,Brazil: Government Vows Crackdown on Cattle Ranchers in the Amazon," Brazilian government officials said Wednesday that they would crack down on cattle ranchers in the Amazon after new data showed that deforestation there had increased by 26 percent in the nine months that ended in April, compared to with the same period a year before. The data showed to that about 710 square miles had been deforested in that time. Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister, called the jump “unacceptable” and vowed to seize the cattle of farmers who are practicing deforestation to cultivate new pastureland. Ibama, Brazil’s environmental protection agency, more than doubled police operations this year intended to deter deforestation. Despite those efforts, Mato Grosso, Brazil’s leading soybean-producing state, saw a 43 percent increase in deforestation in the nine-month period that ended in April, compared to with the same period last year. Leading environmentalists said some farmers had cut down trees because they expected they would be allowed to do so anyway under a bill being considered in Brazil’s Congress to ease restrictions on the amount of land that needed to remain forested.

No other network came close to matching Fox’s ratings.

2011-05-20,A 2012 Release Date Is Set for a ‘Titanic’ in 3-D," In case you ever doubted it, James Cameron is truly the king of the three-dimensional world. Or he will be when his “Titanic” is re-released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox on April 6 in 3-D. Mr. Cameron, whose 3-D “Avatar,” with almost $2.8 billion in ticket sales at the worldwide box office, is the highest-grossing film in history, will revise the record books when “Titanic,” the second-highest-grossing film of all time, with $1.8 billion in worldwide sales, returns to theaters in 3-D. Fox and Paramount joined Mr. Cameron’s Lightstorm Entertainment in announcing the re-release date on Thursday. The next frontier in 3-D may well involve not fantasies and cartoons but naturalistic dramas like “Titanic” (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, left). Steven Soderbergh, for instance, had planned to shoot his coming “Contagion,” a disease drama, in 3-D, but backed off when he couldn’t quite get the results he needed. Still, 3-D thrillers, love stories and raunchy teen comedies (shudder) clearly are just a matter of time.

2011-05-20,Jimmy Lai Animates the News," You own magazines and newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan and have been called the Rupert Murdoch of Asia — and yet you’re best known here for your company’s very enjoyable and weird animated re-enactments of news events. The one you did for Tiger Woods’s Thanksgiving-weekend car accident got more than five million YouTube views. Why did you get into animation?  I started the animations because print media was going into a sunset business environment. It’s obvious that we have arrived at an era of images. I thought that if I could speed up the production of animation, I could make a big business out of recreating the amazing images of the news, because what we get on TV is always the last bit of image. What happened before that image is always missing. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/magazine/questions-for-jimmy-lai-asias-rupert-murdoch.html

2011-05-20,Julian Barnes on Not Talking About Love,"Couples are the beating heart, the systole and diastole, of “Pulse,” Julian Barnes’s diverting third collection of stories. Author of the best-selling “Arthur & George” (an odd-couple historical novel in which “Arthur” is the creator of Sherlock Holmes) and the unclassifiable masterpiece “Flaubert’s Parrot,” Barnes is among the most adventurous writers — in style, versatility and narrative structure — of his Amis-McEwan-Hitchens generation. Another of his beguiling novels, “Talking It Over,” was about a loquacious love triangle, and what the characters mainly talk over in “Pulse” is what makes couples tick. “What do we look for in a partner?” the puzzled narrator, who was “still unmarried at 30,” asks in the title story. Someone who “matches us”? Perhaps.

Peer pressure, she finds, can lead to acts of great courage, or to great harm. But Rosenberg’s particular ambition is to unlock the secret of using it to “transform the world,” in the words of her subtitle. Calling this approach the “social cure,” she examines how social networks can address some of the world’s most recalcitrant problems — from adolescent cigarette smoking to despotism.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/books/review/book-review-join-the-club-by-tina-rosenberg.html

His argument feels as crystalline and bracing as that double martini going down, though you might find yourself a little woozy afterward. And his tone is as warm and inviting as that big, crackling fire, even if the dim flicker does leave things a bit obscure in the corners. I mean, the man recites Rupert Brooke love poetry at length.

Although George Washington has consistently attracted Americans’ attention since Parson Weems’s biography appeared in 1800, during the last decade published examinations of Washington’s contemporaries have multiplied dramatically. Take John Adams. By my rough count, he alone or in conjunction with other men has been the subject of 19 biographical studies and five documentary collections since 2001. Two more books have examined his marriage to Abigail Smith; she herself has warranted two separate biographies. Remarkably, a recent search in the Cornell library catalog for the phrase “founding fathers” in titles of books on American history published since 2001 identified 37 volumes.

2011-05-20,Extra Innings,"If you wanted to write a novel about the redemptive power of America’s pastime, you would imagine a Midwestern cornfield sculptured into a diamond that brought back the dead and healed generational wounds. Then you would remember that this idea has been taken, and instead you would invent the tale of the longest professional game ever played. You would make it a minor league contest, featuring players with mostly faint hopes of getting to the majors; they would absurdly play into the wee hours with no scouts in sight in April’s irrelevant cold. Therefore — and here’s your grand novelistic gesture — they must be persevering for some purpose larger than themselves. It would take place on Easter, the day the dead are reborn, in a decaying Northeastern mill town peopled by working-class Catholics who believe that unimportant things like wafers, wine and baseball can be made holy through faith. If you wished to be really obvious, the game would last 33 innings — one for each of Jesus’ years on earth.

Most perilously, Gursky suffered from prostate cancer.

And though it wasn’t until years later that I even met Kurt, he unwittingly left me a gift: tacked to the bulletin board in the office I took over was a single page titled “Words We Don’t Say.” It contained, as you might surmise, words and phrases that Kurt found annoying and didn’t want used in his magazine. Just yesterday, I rescued it from a bunch of old office stuff that I was throwing out, and I have to say, 14 years later, it’s still a pretty useful list of phony-baloney vocabulary that editors are well-advised to excise from stories.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/words-we-dont-say/

Gentrification has gussied up that once raffish neighborhood, and “a gentler and more refined bunch” of patrons has replaced the colorful and largely criminal riffraff that lent character to the old saloon. But instead of forcing Scudder to make his peace with this new world, Block thoughtfully sends him back to the early 1970s, when he was still a working cop and crime was still “the leading occupation” in the neighborhood.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/books/review/touch-of-evil-books-review.html

2011-05-20,Will the I.M.F. Rise Again?,"Everyone has some fascination with the combination of sex, money and power, but who would have thought they would all point to a career at the International Monetary Fund? Founded in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference with a mandate to prevent wild swings in national currency values, the fund, I would have imagined, would set itself against swinging of every kind.  That is clearly not the case. According to Alan Beattie’s interview this morning with I.M.F. semi-renegade Simon Johnson, the fund was firstly aimed at helping struggling postwar economies in Western Europe, and its first loan (in 1947) was to France.  For 35 of the fund’s 64 years, its managing director was French. When Western Europe had recovered, the fund went on to other things and secured for itself, let’s say, a mixed reputation.  From the 1960s onward, and culminating in the period of strict I.M.F. loan “conditionality” and rigid programs of “structural adjustment,” the fund earned a reputation as a corps of technocratic drones pitilessly contented in their air-conditioned hotel rooms as they imposed cookie-cutter “solutions” on prostrate governments. You would read from time to time of “anti-I.M.F. riots” in one poor capital or another, and you could guess what it meant, and it wasn’t pretty.    By the early part of our own century, the fund was entering a period of repentance, not least because some poorer countries were now “emerging markets” and making a big point of repaying I.M.F. loans and swearing never to take them again. Escaping the I.M.F. became a symbol of freedom. But if the fund wasn’t making loans it had no income, and we know what that means: time for reform! Emerging-market players, with a sympathetic United States, pushed for changes in voting power. In essence, the developing world would get more I.M.F. power at the expense (slightly) of the United States and (mainly) of Europe. Several reforms, first undertaken in 2006 and most recently last year, would take the voting share of “advanced economies” from 60.6 to 55.3, and of “emerging market and developing countries” from 39.4 to 44.7.

2011-05-20,Inside the List,"CITY LIGHTS: Erik Larson’s “In the Garden of Beasts” hits the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 4, without any help from Navy Seals or Steven Tyler’s hairdresser. Instead, it’s got Nazis, romance and old-fashioned storytelling chops, not to mention a cover that makes Berlin in 1933 look an awful lot like the Chicago of the 1893 World’s Fair depicted on the front of Larson’s blockbuster “The Devil in the White City,” which spent a total of 182 weeks on the hardcover and paperback lists starting back in 2003. Like that book, “In the Garden of Beasts” is shaped around the interlocking stories of two characters, the American ambassador William Dodd, who views Hitler’s Berlin with growing alarm, and his daughter, Martha, who finds herself rather enchanted by all the glamorous men in uniform. (“Think Carrie Bradshaw in Berlin,” as USA Today’s reviewer, Deirdre Donahue, put it.) In an interview with The Huffington Post Chicago, Larson, inset, explained his decision to give so much space to Martha, a former assistant literary editor at The Chicago Tribune who left her husband behind to gallivant with French diplomats, Russian agents and the head of the Gestapo: “If I’d hung the entire book on Dodd, it might have been interesting, but it would have lapsed into a diplomatic history.

The two New York-based artists, who recently began exhibiting collaborative work under the name Jules Marquis, share a Greenpoint studio but regularly shuttle to southeast Virginia, where they’ve created a nonprofit art space on a corner of the Turner family farm. Named Jericho Ditch, after a local logging canal, it serves as a venue and creative getaway for fellow artists. It also embodies the Jules Marquis ethos: from the outside, it’s a shed in a field; inside, it’s a big-city-gallery-style white box lighted by symmetrical fluorescent tubes.

Hyperbole, dime store anthropology and overlooked artists often crowd the presentation. But the best of these endeavors don’t seek to galvanize a scene, per se, but provide the most basic of contexts: place. In this way, the mercurial nature of Los Angeles provides a valid starting point for an investigation of its artists. This summer, two separate curatorial teams (both based in New York, funnily enough) will tackle the behemoth subject of art in Los Angeles with group shows staged far from home. “Greater LA,” on view until June 10 in SoHo, looks at the city’s contemporary artists, whereas “Venice in Venice,” which opens on June 4 at the Venice Biennial, revisits the city’s rebel artists from the 1960s and ’70s.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/los-angeles-city-of-artists/

2011-05-23,‘Friday Night Lights’ Watch: Turns of Fortune,"The episode up for discussion is called “Swerve,” alluding both to Julie’s self-imposed car accident and various other instances of changes of heart and turns of fortune. Unable to muster the stamina to return to college after her run-in with Derek’s wife last, week Julie decides that the way to bide more time at home is to ram her car into a mailbox near her parents’ house. Maybe I’d be a really weak and bad parent to a teenager, but I don’t think I would have tried to force Julie to go back to Burleson, which is after all, a fictitious college and one at a significant psychic remove from her dreams of a Northeastern educational experience. Coach Taylor being Coach Taylor, he wanted Julie to man up and face the mess. The whole point of the affair now seems to have been to stack the deck so in favor of Julie’s return home that the show could easily situate her back in Dillon. Perhaps it was too implausible that Julie would just go to Dillon Tech in the first place, so the writers dispatched her to a place where she implausibly made no friends and experienced not a second’s worth of intellectual fulfillment or genuine freshman pleasure.It was interesting to see Coach having the correct perception of Julie’s motives rather than Tami. It is coach who realizes that Julie must have crashed on purpose. Tami is a disbeliever. It was interesting to see the show cast Coach’s impotence — he can’t get Julie in the car and back to school because she refuses with every fiber of her being to go — against Vince’s father’s assertion of paternal authority. Vince is in trouble with his thug lender, and his father steps in and solves problems by beating the daylights out of the guy, hoping to make sure the guy never gets within a yard of Vince again. Will this work? It sure felt as if it would. I’d hate to see this come back to haunt Vince’s father, or worse, for Vince to take the moral high ground against his dad in response.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/friday-night-lights-watch-turns-of-fortune/

2011-05-23,"Ballerinas, Meet Bally-Rina","Who better to judge Bally’s new Bally-Rina collection than the real ballerinas of the New York City Ballet? The differences between the Swiss luxury-house’s flats and your run-of-the-mill ballet ones are vast according to the company’s senior corps de ballet dancers, Gretchen Smith and Marika Anderson. The women work in nude leather Bloch dance shoes both in the classroom and throughout rehearsals. And when they’re not dancing they still prefer to slip into flats. “I’m really picky when it comes to flats because I wear them to the bone,” says Anderson, who previously wore Cole Haan because of the Nike-Air instep. “We really like the Bally-Rina’s in blue,” says Smith pointing out the shoe’s ultra low vamp. Smith also likes that the sole of the shoe is comfortable and how the inside looks like an actual pointe shoe. This summer, the company heads for a slew of performances in Saratoga and both women see themselves wearing Bally-Rina flats, Smith with a flowy high-waisted skirt; Anderson with fitted jeans and a T-shirt. They’ll pair them with matching Bally-Rina bags stuffed with the tools of the trade: several pairs of pointe shoes, flat shoes, tape, scissors, glue, needles and thread, water and vitamin B. The cute but functional special Bally-Rina collection comes in shades of navy, grass green and yellow – that should be more than enough to keep more than New York City ballerinas dancing.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/on-pointe-bally-rina-flats/

On Monday it announced the cancellation of “The United States of Tara,” the comedy-drama starring Toni Collette as a housewife with dissociative identity disorder (commonly known as multiple personality disorder); the current season will be its last. “Tara,” which made its debut in 2009, came with an impressive pedigree, which included its creator, Diablo Cody, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of “Juno,” and the executive producer Steven Spielberg. And Ms. Collette was widely praised for her performance in the title role, winning an Emmy Award in 2009 and a Golden Globe in 2010. But ratings for the series have diminished, from 816,000 viewers for the premiere of Season 2 to 411,000 viewers for the debut of Season 3 in March, The Hollywood Reporter reported. By comparison, the season finale of Showtime’s historical drama “The Borgias” was watched by 810,000 viewers at 10 p.m. on Sunday, the network said.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/showtime-cancels-united-states-of-tara-and-renews-nurse-jackie/

2011-05-24,Numberplay: Tinkering with Ladders,"Last week’s Numberplay puzzle, presented by Gary Antonick and suggested and masterfully moderated by Joshua Zucker, had all the hallmarks of a classic. This puzzle, known as the Ducci game or 4-number game, is easy to state and understand, uses a procedure a child can carry out, and yet it unlocks the door to fabulous mathematical riches. For those who missed it I would urge you to go back and take a look at it. Here is a brief restatement, given a slightly different visual model from last week. Given any four arbitrary positive integers a, b, c and d, representing the top rung of a ladder, you construct another step below it, consisting of the positive differences between them taken cyclically: |a-b|, |b-c|, |c-d| and |d-a|. An example 2-step ladder is:1 2 5 91 3 4 8It turns out that all such ladders eventually end as all the numbers become zeroes. One challenge was to find what initial numbers gave rise to the longest ladders, and it turned out that the champion quartets had a fascinating mathematical property.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/numberplay-tinkering-with-ladders/

2011-05-24,French Connection | HI Matic,"Social media, eco-lodging and a D.I.Y. ethic intersect at HI Matic, a new B&B-hostel hybrid in the hip Paris neighborhood of EsBas (East Bastille). The hotel takes a plugged-in approach to hospitality, eschewing full-service concierge and staff for a digitally customizable experience. Not only can guests tailor nearly every detail of their stay on touch-screens throughout the building, but they can also share information with the room next door – or, if they want, with all 42 rooms at once. The organic breakfast is served through futuristic vending machines, which also offer books, aromatherapy diffusers and other goodies. Each visitor receives a personalized list of exhibitions and shows recommended by local experts, and two electronic music stations – one mellow, one groovier – are available on every floor, courtesy of the German record label Kompakt. Matali Crasset, a Philippe Starck protégée who has opened three other hotels with the HI group (two in Nice and one in Nefta, Tunisia), created Ryokan-inspired rooms with modular furniture and floor mattresses. She chose the area for its authenticity and charm. “There are lots of bars and it’s fun, but the neighborhood is not touristy,” she says. “It has kept its local flavor, with mom-and-pop shops and cafés.” Among her favorite spots is Septime (80 rue de Charonne), a new foodie hotspot directly across the street from the hotel where the star chef Bertrand Grébaut concocts simple but sophisticated dishes that le tout Paris is raving about.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/french-connection-hi-matic/

Under a settlement negotiated by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and announced on Monday, the Speed will soon turn over the work to Homeland Security, which will transfer it to Italian cultural authorities.

The Han are the dominant ethnicity in China and make up the majority of the population in Inner Mongolia. The protest on Tuesday ended after government officials made several promises, including addressing the case of Mergen.

Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature have already adopted a state budget that drastically cuts funds to schools and local communities — cuts that were far deeper than needed to balance the budget because of Mr. Cuomo’s indefensible refusal to extend a tax surcharge on New York’s wealthiest residents. Now they want to adopt a cheap political tool — a 2 percent property tax cap — that would only further devastate communities around the state that can least afford it. ,Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/opinion/26thu1.html

2011-05-26,Running on Medicare the Right Way,"After their surprise victory in a heavily Republican Congressional district of western New York, Democrats believe they have the magic formula for winning back the House next year. “Medicare, Medicare, and Medicare,” said Representative Steve Israel of Long Island, who runs the Democratic election effort in the House. There is enormous power in Mr. Israel’s new cudgel. Even Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who wrote the plan to privatize Medicare and end its guarantee to the elderly, admitted that it played a significant role in the victory by Kathy Hochul, the Democrat. Nonetheless, effective as the playbook was in one special election, Democrats cannot expect to build their entire 2012 campaign around attacking the Ryan plan. It’s a useful reminder of the vast differences between the parties, but defines only the Republicans, not the Democrats. ",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/opinion/26thu2.html

2011-05-26,Stripes | Haans Nicholas Mott,"Haans Nicholas Mott’s traipse into designing clothes was kind of an accident. “Someone who just liked my style one day unexpectedly asked me if I wanted to work on the line with him,” says Mott. Perhaps because of his background in architecture, the New York-based designer, who is 33, is very particular about the construction of his unisex private label line. The clothes have been featured alongside Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester and Yohji Yamamoto in editorials for “SOME/THINGS” magazine. His collection includes hand-painted striped tops (five to six hours of painting) that are frayed in all the right places (36 hours to machine-sew and hand finish) and have the perfect dose of weight to shield against a cool spring breeze. The fit is boyish and over sized but the imperfection of the lines add a touch of whimsy. The collection also has unconventionally shaped short jackets (another three to five days of sewing) and rich-hued duffel coats with detachable hoods (hand sewn for eight to nine days). “Architecture gives you a set of problem-solving skills,” he says. “Once I started sewing, I got very into cutting patterns, developing stitches and constructing things.” Each collection has only about a dozen pieces and is only available through special order. “When things become large, you can’t control it,” says Mott. That firm control of his process, he says, is the most exciting part of clothing making. “If the process become boring, I’ll quit.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/stripes-haans-nicholas-mott/

2011-05-26,36 Hours in Niagara Falls,"AT Niagara Falls, the United States is the poor relation and Canada is king. Nature gave Canada the wide-angle view of the majestic waterfall that straddles the border between the two countries, and the Canadians’ commercial bet on tourism landed most of the visitor comforts on their side of the Niagara River. American reliance on industry, however, ended in Rust Belt ruin. Yet the story isn’t so simple. Casinos, high-rise hotels and hucksterish come-ons have so proliferated in Niagara Falls, Ontario, that it risks feeling like a tired amusement park. Meanwhile, in Niagara Falls, New York, the visitor who ventures inside the shabby, underfinanced state park is surprised to discover vestiges of something like a natural landscape. The party is in Canada. The real feel of the river, in all its awesome power, is more accessible in the United States.

2011-05-26,The Wrongful Conviction as Way of Life,"Judge Learned Hand called “the ghost of the innocent man convicted” an “unreal dream.” But in “Convicting the Innocent,” Brandon L. Garrett shows that it can be a “nightmarish reality.” Since the late 1980s, DNA testing has exonerated more than 250 wrongly convicted people, who spent an average of 13 years in prison for crimes they didn’t commit. (There is every reason to think that more people have been wrongly convicted since then, but only these 250 have been definitively exonerated by postconviction DNA tests.) Seventeen of the 250 were sentenced to die, and 80 to spend the rest of their lives in prison. By poring over trial transcripts and interviewing lawyers, prosecutors and court reporters, Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, seeks to explore who these 250 innocent people are, and why they were wrongly convicted. His alarming conclusion: the wrongful convictions were not idiosyncratic but resulted from a series of flawed practices that the courts rely on every day, namely, false and coerced confessions, questionable eyewitness procedures, invalid forensic testimony and corrupt statements by jailhouse informers. Garrett’s book is a gripping contribution to the literature of injustice, along with a galvanizing call for reform.

Thanks to the young designers Anne Botica and Monique Moore, whose recently launched clothing line, Mott 50, contains brightly colored basics with UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) 50 — which is 10 times the protection of a typical white tee. “It really started because we noticed a shift in trends amongst our friends,” says Moore, 28, who quit her day job at Condé Nast Digital a few short months after starting the line in the pink-walled apartment she shares with Botica (fittingly located on Manhattan’s Mott Street). “Girls were finally starting to cover up with hats, sun block and tunics rather than trying to get as tan — and burned to a crisp — as possible.” For the 27-year-old Botica, fashion is really a family affair. “There’s a history of skin cancer in my family,” she says. (An olive-green cotton poplin shirtdress with gold accents is named after Botica’s younger sibling, Faith, $125.) “Our clothes block both UVB, which causes burning and tanning, and UVA rays, which cause aging, wrinkles, sunspots, and skin cancer.” This summer, a portion of Mott 50’s proceeds will go towards cancer research.

A reupholsterer of antiques by trade and a congenital loser by nature, Bob spends his free hours in the (amazingly named) fictional town of St. Nils tinkering with a device he calls the Communicator, whose purpose is to breach the wall separating the living and the dead. Bob’s vanity and his avarice — both seemingly small-time — drive him to this work, and faint dreams of wealth, fame and sexual satisfaction pervade his quotidian existence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/book-review-toward-you-by-jim-krusoe.html
2011-05-27,Adultery in the U. K.,"The people in Tessa Hadley’s latest novel, “The London Train,” seem to be managing the trials of adulthood reasonably well, right up until the moment their lives jump the tracks. Their problems are the familiar and expected ones — grief at the death of a parent, career disappointments, marital friction — although that makes them no less difficult or wrenching. No one is more surprised than Hadley’s characters when they act on irrational impulse. She sets out to make these blinkered lives plausible, and then to subvert our natural sympathy into something more resembling judgment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/book-review-the-london-train-by-tessa-hadley.html

His phenomenally popular “American Spelling Book,” first published in 1783, outsold every book in the 19th century except the Bible. His relentless book promotion pioneered now common techniques like the author tour, the fabricated blurb and the aggressive stoking of manufactured controversy. His efforts to protect his work from piracy contributed to the development of American copyright laws. In 1793 he founded American Minerva, the first daily newspaper in New York City, eight years before Alexander Hamilton started The New York Post.

2011-05-27,How to Care for Your Mother,"Combining personal narrative with practical advice, as Jane Gross does in “A Bittersweet Season,” is a tricky business. A reader swept up in a story is apt to resent the intrusion of brass tacks. And a reader looking for how-tos will have little use for the details of an author’s own tale. Particularly perilous are the transitions between the instructional and the essayistic — passages reminiscent of the fraught moments in Broadway musicals when ordinary speech must lift into song. There is the actor, speaking his lines; suddenly he leans on his pitchfork, squints into the distance and breaks into a soaring rendition of “Oh, What a Beautiful Morning.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/book-review-a-bittersweet-season-caring-for-our-aging-parents-and-ourselves-by-jane-gross.html

It is hard to imagine the day when we say goodbye to the last survivor of the Second World War, so large do the “good war” and the “greatest generation” still loom in the national imagination. But the calendar and the census do not lie. Some 16 million Americans served in the military during World War II. On the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 2001, about 5.5 million were still living.

Muammar el-Qaddafi from power it will mean not only the fall of the longest reigning dictator in the Arab world but also the end of the ambitious ideological system that he dreamed would supersede all rivals. While much of the world sees him as an eccentric and brutal demagogue, Qaddafi has tried for decades to portray himself as a statesman-philosopher. It’s an aspiration best embodied in the Green Book, his notorious three-part meditation on politics, economics and everything from the evils of mechanized poultry farming to the importance of owning one’s car. In Libya, the text is omnipresent: several generations of students grew up studying it, and the government even constructed sculptures in its image.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/what-did-qaddafis-green-book-really-say.html
2011-05-27,Up Front,"It shouldn’t be surprising that a writer whose work includes a story collection called “Throw Like a Girl” and a novel called “The Woman Driver” should have strong opinions on the pigeonholing of writers by gender. Jean Thompson, whose latest novel, “The Year We Left Home,” has just been published, is a longtime practitioner of what she described in a recent e-mail as “the sturdy realistic tradition” that she shares with the British writer Tessa Hadley, whose novel “The London Train” she reviews on Page 13. Hadley, Thompson noted, is a “first-rate psychologist” who immerses the reader in her characters using “a particularly intimate form of third-person narrator.” And Hadley has presented half of her novel — which delves into some of the familiar problems of modern life also found in the “women’s novels” one of the characters reads — from the perspective of a man. “When I taught writing,” Thompson recalled, “inevitably students loved to worry this point, how you could identify ‘male’ or ‘female’ writing. So I brought in some blind samples: women writing about sea voyages, men writing about intense emotional experiences. When I asked them to guess the author’s gender, they fell right into that famous trap.” The Editors ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/up-front.html

2011-05-27,Inside the List,"LET’S GO CRAZY: Celebrities may rule the best-seller list, but psychopaths still rule the world. At least that’s the hypothesis floated by Jon Ronson in “The Psychopath Test,” new at No. 11 on the hardcover nonfiction list. In the book, Ronson (inset) consorts with psychologists, corporate titans, madmen, Scientologists and a cabal of “giant, blood-drinking, child-­sacrificing pedophile lizards”—oh, sorry, those guys were actually from Ronson’s earlier book “Them” — in an effort to prove that those afflicted with “mad striving for unlimited success and excessive admiration” profoundly shape society and, more important, can be identified with the help of a simple 20-item checklist. Alas, Ronson finds only one high-profile potential psychopath willing to take the test: Albert (Chainsaw Al) Dunlap, the corporate cost-cutting king. (“You know how I said in my e-mail that your amygdala might not shoot the requisite signals of fear to your central nervous system and that’s perhaps why you’ve been so successful?” Ronson asks gingerly.) Not that Ronson presents himself as the picture of mental health.

The British education minister has proposed letting wealthy students pay for spots at top universities even though they failed to get in through the regular admissions process. “Rage and confusion have been the immediate results,” The Boston Globe reports. Admission to British universities is based on meritocratic competition; once students get in, they pay a low flat fee. At Oxford, it is about $6,000 a year, The Globe says. Supporters of the idea say the extra cash will bolster the educational system. Less affluent students would not lose out, they say, because these new spots would be “extra” ones. Critics say the two-tier idea is profoundly unfair. “The proposals are likely to be criticized as a means for the wealthiest to ‘buy places’ at a time when the government is to cut 10,000 publicly funded places,” The Guardian reported.",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/weekinreview/29grist.html

Ms. Yellen was the producer of CBS’s film “The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana” (1982), which drew a huge audience. “William & Kate” is more than a romance; it’s also “a psychological story of the memory of the mother, in this case Princess Diana, and her legacy,” Ms. Yellen said. The film shows how William “has to choose to live his life with her memory and with the decisions he has to make,” including the decision of whom to marry. The couple were married on April 29 in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Filming for the movie, which imagines some scenes from the couple’s romance, began in early May. Ms. Yellen, who met Princess Diana, described the project as “a very personal story.” She added, “In a way, it’s my tribute to her as well as a tribute to the young couple.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/arts/television/royal-love-story-heads-to-hallmark.html

2011-05-31,Fantasy Focus: Moving the Needle,"It’s hard for a first-round pick to move up significantly, but aside from Jose Bautista, Ryan Braun is probably the top hitter in fantasy baseball this year. While Braun’s 12 home runs and .588 slugging percentage through Sunday are improvements over last year’s rates, the number that jumps out most is his 13 steals in 14 attempts. Milwaukee’s new manager, Ron Roenicke, is more aggressive on the basepaths than his predecessor, Ken Macha: the Brewers are 14th in the majors in stolen bases this year, as opposed to 21st last year, and Braun in particular is getting the green light. At this pace, a 35-35 season is within reach, and with Braun, you’re virtually assured a good batting average. Only Carlos Gonzalez and maybe Matt Kemp offer the same speed-power-average upside, and Gonzalez is struggling this year.Jacoby Ellsbury’s 2010 was a lost season because of rib injuries, but as he is 27, his value has never been higher. The 19 stolen bases through Sunday put him on pace for close to 60 steals, and that’s not accounting for chilly early-season conditions that often slow the running game. Ellsbury also has 6 home runs and 16 doubles and is posting a .298/.368/.462 line in 208 at-bats while hitting leadoff in one of the league’s best lineups. In short, he’s what the Red Sox hoped Carl Crawford would be when they gave him $142 million. Crawford was a late first-round pick in most leagues, and Ellsbury must be considered similarly at this point.",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/fantasy-focus-moving-the-needle-8/

Another specialty of this French pastry chef are fine macarons in many flavors. And no wonder: he worked in Paris with the chef Pierre Hermé, who probably did more for the macaron than Proust did for the madeleine. Brownies (some with praline filling), cookies, madeleines and loaf cakes are also turned out by the busy bakers in the open kitchen.
