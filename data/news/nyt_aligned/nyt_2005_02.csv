A member of the US National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Trager was best known for his seminal contributions to our understanding of the malaria parasite.

He was a passionate collector of parasite strains and was deeply interested in genetic variation of the malaria parasite and the mechanisms that generated parasite diversity. He trained generations of parasitologists and his impact on malaria research is immeasurable. Dr. Trager loved the lab, loved doing experiments and was active at the bench into his late '80's.

Bloomberg said yesterday. The change follows criticism by the firefighters union that smaller crews, which save the city money, posed a danger to firefighters and the public. But Mr. Bloomberg said the decision was made because fewer firefighters are on sick leave. Under the contract with the union, the city can remove the fifth firefighter if more than 7.5 percent of city firefighters are on medical leave. The mayor said the percentage has fallen below that threshold.

Citing both turmoil in Nepal and a deteriorating security situation in Bangladesh, where the meeting was to be held, India's foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not take part. On Tuesday, King Gyanendra dismissed Nepal's government, imposed a state of emergency and curtailed constitutional guarantees, including the right of assembly. Rights groups said they had reports of media censorship and of a substantial number of arrests. The king had announced that he would attend the summit meeting in place of the prime minister he had just fired, and India clearly intended to send strong messages not only to Nepal, but also to Bangladesh, plagued by increasing lawlessness and political violence. Last week, a former finance minister was killed in a grenade attack. Indian officials said there were concerns about how safe Mr. Singh would be in Dhaka. On Tuesday, several bombs were thrown in Dhaka, including one at the hotel where Mr. Singh and the other leaders were to stay.

2005-02-04,The Listings; JAMES URBANIAK,"Liking the little known character actor James Urbaniak has long been a sign of downtown cool. For years, Mr. Urbaniak, above, who specializes in portrayals of sensitive outsiders racked by angst, obsession or artistic genius, has been a star in hipster circles because of his oddball roles in black-box theaters (he played the French theorist Guy Debord in the stage adaptation of ""Lipstick Traces""), Hal Hartley movies (the shy poet/garbage man in ""Henry Fool"") and the occasional television cameo (the foot fetishist in ""Sex and the City""). But lately, he has begun to branch out, making his Broadway debut earlier this season in a scene-stealing turn as a gossipy servant in the revival of the 18th-century comedy ""The Rivals."" And he is currently starring in a commercial Off Broadway production as the jumpy title character in Will Eno's one-man-show ""Thom Pain (based on nothing),"" a teasing play that might remind audiences of one of Edward Albee's more abstract dramas. Mr. Urbaniak, whose angular face and slender body gives him the look of a hungry bird, delivers an astonishing performance of a vacant, yet somehow charming, man who rambles in an almost stream of consciousness style for 60 minutes. The script is willfully inscrutable, full of jokes without punch lines and magic tricks that peter out. But what is consistent throughout is the alert and icy gaze of Mr. Urbaniak, who keeps your attention totally transfixed, generating suspense with hardly any plot to assist him. He may be performing above 14th street, but Mr. Urbaniak remains as cool as ever.

2005-02-04,"Paid Notice: Deaths   CANICK, MOSES LEON, M.D.","CANICK--Moses Leon, M.D., age 82, died on February 2, 2005 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was a Professor Emeritus and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at SUNY Health Science Center, Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Kings County Hospital and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brookdale Medical Center, all of Brooklyn. The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residence, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed. His enthusiasm, curiosity and appetite for life made him an interesting and great conversationalist and enabled him to bear the infirmities of aging with dignity, courage and humor. Many thanks to his doctors, whose support and affection for him was unflagging, to his nurses Elaine, Brigid and Eileen, who cared for him with professionalism and love and to loving and faithful Virginia and Dora. Eternal gratitude to his friends who gave care, love and compassion. Leon is survived by his beloved wife Josephine L. Berger-Nadler, his children Michael, Jonathan, Jenny and Eliott from his former marriage, his sisters Emma and Rachal and three grandchildren, Julia, Lily, and Melissa and is predeceased by his son William.

Costs will amount to $30 million to $35 million on a pretax basis this year, plus an additional $20 million to $22 million to improve efficiency and contract out some work, the company said. D&B said in April it would cut about 1,000 jobs in 2004 to lower costs and focus its business on areas where it saw the most growth. In October, the company said it would eliminate about 750 jobs as part of an agreement with International Business Machines to take over some call-center activities.

2005-02-04,The Listings; SHERMAN DREXLER: 'ART PARADISE: 50 YEARS OF PAINTING',"That things primitive and archaic should have been such compelling points of orientation for forward-thinking Modernists is one of the more fruitful paradoxes of 20th-century art. Sherman Drexler, 80, is a case in point. Mr. Drexler, who has been heard from little since a solo exhibition at P.S. 1 in 1984, has followed his own slightly eccentric path for more than five decades, but his paintings of generalized female nudes (based on his wife, the Pop painter and writer Rosalyn Drexler), horses or deer in the midst of broad, flat areas of paint combine the primordial and the abstract in a way that is close to the center of a Modernist mainstream running from Matisse to Susan Rothenberg. The large canvases featured in this small retrospective show have a scruffy, raw appearance; they are not beautiful but they exude a persuasive urgency of purpose. That Mr. Drexler thinks of himself at least in part as a kind of modern cave painter is affirmed by a remarkable installation of about 120 small paintings and objects imported from his Newark studio. Distributed over a plywood table, above, are scores of stones and fragments of construction debris on which the artist has roughly painted little dancing female nudes as though to evoke the timeless, pantheistic soul of the modern material world.

2005-02-04,The Listings; PAUL BADURA-SKODA,"Among the new generation of concertgoers, the eminent Austrian pianist Paul Badura-Skoda, who is 77 , may not have the name recognition he once had. But he has had an impact on his field through decades of performances and recordings, especially of the Viennese classical repertory, and also through his important scholarly contributions, including valued editions of works by Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Mr. Badura-Skoda, above, whose last name is a combination of his father's and stepfather's given names (both of Czech heritage), will give an all-Schubert recital at the Austrian Cultural Forum tonight. The recital comes just after the release by Kleos Classics of a seven-CD set, ""Paul Badura-Skoda: A Man and His Music,"" that chronicles his long career. It includes private recordings from his teenage years that may startle those who know of him only as an urbane musician and scholar. There are, for example, his performances of some Rossini overtures played on the accordion in his own transcriptions. The accordion was his stepfather's passion, and young Paul was essentially compelled to learn it. In the extensive liner notes to the recording Mr. Badura-Skoda charmingly recalls how he used to sneak into the standing-room section of the Vienna State Opera through an obscure entry. He also vividly describes some formative experiences, like taking master classes with the great pianist Edwin Fischer, performing a Mozart concerto with FurtwÃ¤ngler just 18 months before the conductor's death, and working with Herbert von Karajan. The last CD documents Mr. Badura-Skoda's 75th birthday concert in 2002 in Vienna, a program of Schubert, Brahms and Ravel played with poise, style and insight. His all-Schubert recital tonight offers 13 waltzes, four impromptus and the Sonata in A (D. 959). (Tonight at 8, Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)772-1132.

2005-02-04,The Listings; HOU HSIAO-HSIEN,"It's hard not to be instantly captivated by the early films of Hou Hsiao-hsien, the Taiwanese filmmaker who is being honored with a retrospective beginning today at Anthology Film Archives. The 1985 movie ""A Time to Live and a Time to Die,"" screening tonight at 7, is an autobiographical account of Mr. Hou's childhood that seems to consist almost entirely of incidental details -- tops spinning in the dirt of a village square, a towel fluttering in the wind -- which eventually add up to a full, vibrant portrait of a provincial city. Mr. Hou has the great gift of being able to stand back from the characters he has created, observing them from a careful distance while they go about their apparently autonomous lives. Mr. Hou's great subject has always been Taiwan, the island outpost to which his family fled after the Communist takeover of mainland China. The early films focus on social problems -- alienated youth in ""The Boys From Fengkuei"" (1983), unemployment in ""Dust in the Wind"" (1987) -- while the later work, like ""The Puppetmaster"" (1993), ""Good Men, Good Women"" (1995) and ""Goodbye South, Goodbye"" (1996), above, takes a more historical and cultural approach, observing contemporary Taiwan through a cloud of cigarette smoke and a jangle of cellphones. (All of these titles will be screened this week at Anthology, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, in the East Village; for a complete schedule, check www.anthologyfilmarchives.org or call (212)505-5181.

It was a bad night for CBS News in every hour: ""60 Minutes"" yielded its lowest ratings of the season at 8 p.m., and the network's broadcast of the Democrats' response and its analysis of the speech at 10 p.m. ranked last, behind NBC's and ABC's.

The program was nearly three times as popular as the network's regular lineup, ""Life as We Know It"" and ""Extreme Makeover."" But CBS's dominance on Thursdays is entrenched, and new episodes of ""CSI"" and ""Without a Trace"" brought the No. 1 network a victory in both total viewers and households.

The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residence, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed.

She served as director of student affairs, editor of the first alumni directory and a founder of both the alumni and student government associations. Her dedication to public health and her love of teaching were extraordinary.

Her contributions to the School include the establishment of the Gelman Professorship in the Department of Epidemiology in honor of her late husband. She also established the Gelman Laboratory Suite for Infectious Disease Research in the Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Infectious Disease Laboratory. She was a remarkable woman and we are the less for her passing. A memorial service will be held this spring on the Columbia University Medical Center campus. In lieu of flowers, it was her request that contributions in her memory be made to either the Mailman School's Fund for Public Health Leadership, or to support the Gelman Laboratory.

Bill Carter, a spokesman for the bureau, called it a minor incident that did not affect secure communications links, which are not connected to the affected network. The incident is under investigation. A spokesman for AT&T, which handles the affected part of the F.B.I.'s e-mail system, would not provide details. The announcement came the day after the F.B.I. announced that it would probably scrap a $170 million overhaul of its computer system. Courtney C.

2005-02-07,World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Regulator Concerned About Exchange Takeover,"Britain's market regulator, the Financial Services Authority, has expressed concerns about a possible takeover of the London Stock Exchange by a foreign buyer. While not taking sides on the issue, the regulator said the exchange's shareholders should ask how bidders would regulate the British market. If the exchange were acquired and merged with one run from outside Britain, British listing rules would not necessarily govern companies listed on the exchange, said Callum McCarthy, chairman of the authority. ""The attractiveness of the U.K. financial markets, and ultimately the competitiveness of the E.U. capital markets, depends in part on a system of corporate governance and of regulation which is of a high standard,"" Mr. McCarthy said. In addition, corporate acquisitions would become more complex, he said. The Deutsche BÃ¶rse has bid for the London exchange, and Euronext, based in Paris, has expressed interest in a takeover.

Mr. Evans had sued the ""Aviator"" producer Michael Mann to secure his credit, and had an awkward moment backstage at the Golden Globes, where he got a statue but was shouldered out of a photo opportunity (far right, with another producer, Graham King). The academy also decided to award three producer credits on ""Million Dollar Baby,"" to Clint Eastwood, Albert S. Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg.

2005-02-07,Shabby Chic,"Muslin is the cheap friend of cottage curtains. But in haute couture, it's the handmaiden to the evening gown. No designer worthy of being called a couturier would risk spoiling 30 yards of Lyons silk to make a prototype that will be stuck with pins, stained with ink and even garishly daubed with Post-its. That's what humble muslin is for. It's the R.E.M. phase of the couture dream cycle, when designers transfer each sketch to a plain raiment they call a toile. They actually spend more time with the toiles than they do the finished dresses, since couture workrooms don't begin to assemble all the various parts of a garment -- the jacket front that may be at Lesage for embroidery, a collar that may be waiting for its hand-dyed ribbon trim -- until a few days before the show. This gives the toiles a certain influence beyond their quiet ability to impart a sense of line and silhouette to the designer as he sits in his studio refreshing himself with a Diet Pepsi (here you think of Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel) or another Marlboro (that would be John Galliano at Dior). That the toiles are as ghostly as they are beautifully made is not surprising; they serve as the patterns for the atelier when it's time to roll out the silk and organdy. And that's why they're embellished not with beads but with photocopies of beads and words like ""droit"" and ""grosgrain."" But the toiles are deceptive. A coat from Chanel looks wholesomely sweet in muslin, but when the needles are done, it may be in smoky shades of gray mohair embroidered on tulle and cost a pretty penny. And when you see Dior's Directoire-inspired dresses in white chiffon under coats worthy of Empress Josephine herself, the muslin loses its temporal power and returns to the cottage windows.

2005-02-07,Inside the List,"GOING NEGATIVE: The books that make the Times hardcover fiction list tend to be, by and large, review-proof. Nothing Michiko Kakutani or Jonathan Yardley can say will keep Michael Crichton or Clive Cussler or Danielle Steel from claiming a place at this 15-seat table. But what about nonfiction? Consider the hardy book at No. 6 this week, the British writer Lynne Truss's ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation."" Truss's book has sat on the nonfiction list for 42 weeks, much longer than any other current title. Her book also happens to have withstood one of the most withering reviews in recent memory, Louis Menand's acid account, in The New Yorker, of the book's own grammatical errors. (""Either Truss needed a copy editor or her copy editor needed a copy editor,"" Menand cracked.) Truss's editor reacted; he called Menand a name that's not printable here. And in the London newspapers, at least one writer rushed patriotically to Truss's defense, describing Menand as humorless and observing that many of his criticisms are matters ""of taste and not correctness."" American readers, in love with Truss's breezily outraged tone, haven't seemed to care either way. Her new book, ""Talk to the Hand,"" will be published in November. It is about manners.

Vice president of Rabin-Winters, Inc. and founder of a successful consulting practice in mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Winter's passion for service dominated his life.

Demonstrating his profound belief in the Technion as the future of Israel, he and his beloved wife, Elaine, supported a variety of ATS projects, including the Ben and Elaine Winters Computer and Communications Network, which linked many of the Technion's research laboratories and departments to mainframe computers by fiber optics. In recognition of his dedicated service, Mr. Winters was presented with the Albert Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor.

If college students want to build sound minds and sound bodies, they should take up a sport or work out at the gym, which also might be a good way to find a date. If they are looking for ways to develop leadership potential, they can participate in student government or start a club. If fraternities and sororities are allowed to continue at all, they should be organized along professional lines or serve specific lifestyle niches that are not adequately addressed on campus, e.g., a house for students with specific religious requirements like Sigma Delta Tau (sorority for Jewish women), or a house for gay and lesbian students (that would have been an excellent leadership opportunity for Denizet-Lewis).",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/opinion/ban-of-brothers-239909.html

He was a Professor Emeritus and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at SUNY Health Science Center, Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Kings County Hospital and former Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brookdale Medical Center, all of Brooklyn. The only twice elected President of the Alumni Association-College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, he was a recipient of the Frank L. Babbott Memorial Award for Excellence in Teaching, a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and the author of numerous publications on plastic and reconstructive surgery. Born on the fourth of July in 1922, Leon was a 1942 graduate of Rutgers University. He left medical school in 1943 to enter the U.S. Navy, and was skipper (Lt. J.G., USN) of an LCT in the Pacific theatre during WWII. He was present at the invasions of Okinawa and Iwo Jima and was a witness to the raising of the US flag on Mt. Surabachi. Returning to medical school after the War, Leon earned a medical degree at Long Island College Hospital (now SUNY Medical School) in 1949, and a graduate degree in history from New York University in 1980. Leon's life was dedicated to the practice of plastic surgery, imparting his knowledge and modesty to his beloved medical residents, and to enhancing the quality of life for his patients. An avid cyclist and accomplished pianist, from Chopin to the golden oldies, Leon's enthusiastic ""bravos"" at the opera and ballet will be missed. His enthusiasm, curiosity and appetite for life made him an interesting and great conversationalist and enabled him to bear the infirmities of aging with dignity, courage and humor. Many thanks to his doctors, whose support and affection for him was unflagging, to his nurses Elaine, Brigid and Eileen, who cared for him with professionalism and love and to loving and faithful Virginia and Dora. Eternal gratitude to his friends who gave care, love and compassion. Leon is survived by his beloved wife Josephine L. Berger-Nadler, his children Michael, Jonathan, Jenny and Eliott from his former marriage, his sisters Emma and Rachal and three grandchildren, Julia, Lily, and Melissa and is predeceased by his son William.

Yet in the past decade, the handling of livestock on their way to the killing floor has actually been one of the parts of the business that has improved most significantly.

2005-02-07,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SMITH, RICHARD E.","SMITH--Richard E. A wellknown figure in the consumer goods world and heralded as an innovator who was formative in shaping the ice cream and frozen dessert industry, passed away on Saturday, January 29, at the age of 62. Descended from three generations of New York City purveyors of ice cream, Richard was Co-Chairman and CoChief Executive of CoolBrands International Inc., the Canadian ice cream maker which owns Chipwich, Eskimo Pie and the license for many branded frozen desserts, including Godiva Ice Cream and Tropicana fruit bars. He led the company from Ronkonkoma, New York, and was a resident of Southampton, New York. It was said that ice cream was in Richard's blood. His grandfather started Smith Brothers Ice Cream in the early 1900's, one of the first distributors of ice cream in the New York metropolitan area that made deliveries using horse drawn carriage. His father, Lester Smith, founder of Duvall French Ice Cream, owned and operated the last ice cream manufacturing plant in Manhattan, located at 92nd and 2nd Avenue. Richard Smith, however, built his own business from the ground up. In his mid-20's, he bought a partnership interest in Calip Dairies, Inc., and created what is today one of the largest distributors of ice cream in the tri-state region and the manufacturer of such ice cream brands as Dolly Madison, Schrafft's and Sedutto. In 1980 he created FrsenGladj, the super premium ice cream with the memorable name and the futuristic white, sculptured container that he later sold to Kraft Foods in 1995. That same year he bought Steve's Ice Cream of Boston, which he took public in 1986 as Steve's Homemade Ice Cream, Inc. The company then acquired Swensen's Ice Cream and grew to be a major ice cream manufacturer and franchisor. He merged his company (then called Integrated Brands, Inc.) with Yogen Frz World-Wide Inc. to create CoolBrands International Inc. in 1998. Under Richard's leadership, CoolBrands acquired The Eskimo Pie Corporaton in 2000, then Fruit-A-Freeze and Chipwich in 2002. In 2003, the company also bought Nestle's U.S. ice cream distribution operations; Dreyer's super premium brands Dreamery Ice Cream and Whole Fruit Sorbet; and the license for Godiva Ice Cream. Most recently, CoolBrands entered into an agreement to acquire Breyer's Yogurt from Kraft Foods. Richard was seen as the consummate entrepreneur whom many have called a ""larger than life"" figure. His colleagues and competitors remember him as a passionate and tireless worker who was remarkable for his creative intelligence, detailed knowledge of the business, and tremendous determination and persistence. He was also known for his deep devotion to his family and for his unpretentious demeanor and generous spirit. He was active in raising money for philanthropic causes, including the Diabetes Research Institute and many other charities. Richard Smith was born in 1942 in the Bronx, and attended Great Neck North High School on Long Island. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio University and attended Syracuse Law School. Richard is survived by his mother, Fay; his loving wife of 39 years, Susan; his son, David; his two grandsons, Jared and James; and three godchildren, Ben, Hannah and Juliana Stein.

In addition to teaching finance, money and banking, and accounting to Hamilton undergraduates as the McEwen Professor of Economics, Dr. Wertimer served at various junctures of his career as economics department chairman, associate dean of the college, provost and college marshal. For half a century he was a volunteer firefighter for the Village of Clinton and kept a department radio crackling in his kitchen 24 hours a day. Born in Buffalo, New York, on October 28, 1920, Sidney Wertimer graduated in 1942 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, then reported for active duty as an Ensign aboard the Navy destroyer William D. Porter. Following WWII, Lieutenant Wertimer returned to the University of Buffalo to obtain an M.A. degree in economics and went from there abroad to study at the London School of Economics where he earned a Ph.D. in 1952. Via transatlantic telephone, he was offered an assistant professorship at Hamilton, where he remained a conspicuous and highly energetic presence on campus for the next five decades. He is the author of ""Economics and Man,"" a college textbook used nationally. Professor Wertimer is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Eleanor M. Walsh; four children: Peter (Alicia Mendicino), Sheila (Gary Gruca), Stephen (Jane Boster), and Thomas (Raylene Saltouse); and ten grandchildren.

Last week that city rejected a billboard campaign for the French fashion house MarithÃ© et FranÃ§ois Girbaud depicting a female version of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" after it was deemed potentially offensive to Christians. The campaign plays off the popularity of Dan Brown's bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code,"" which insinuates that the figure of St. John the Evangelist in that work actually embodies Mary Magdalene. The outlawed billboard portrays John, the only man in the picture, in a provocative half-naked pose being embraced by a female apostle, and the municipal advertising ethics committee decided that this ""made the imitation more offensive.""

A preliminary inquiry indicated that the acetylene flowed through pipes intended to carry water into a shed near the production area, where an electric switch or a propane heater's pilot light ignited it. Stephen J. Selk, an investigator with the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said that the presence of an open-flame heater near an acetylene production site could be a violation of federal fire-safety codes, and that if it were not, the rules might need to be rewritten. The explosion occurred at the Acetylene Service Company. Messages left on Friday for company officials were not answered.

Fox was No.1 in every major measure in the Nielsen ratings by wide margins, which puts the network in a strong position during this sweeps period. But the total number of viewers was down from last year, when 89.79 million people watched another Patriots victory on CBS. Tivo, the manufacturer of the video recording device, also released statistics about the game's most replayed moments, culled from a sample of 10,000 subscribers. According to the Tivo data, Tedy Bruschi's interception for the Patriots was the most rewound play of the game, but most replayed moment of the broadcast was when a phone number was shown on the screen telling viewers how to call in to vote for the most valuable player. The most rewound commercial was GoDaddy.com's spoof of last year's infamous Janet Jackson halftime show, when Justin Timberlake ripped off the singer's top.

It would take some hard work, indeed, to get Congress to face up to the binge of deficit spending that is haunting the nation and future generations of taxpayers. Yet Mr. Bush is not going to face the music. Instead, he's investing his precious re-election clout in pushing a wildly expensive plan to divert some Social Security payments to private accounts, a step that would not even address the long-term financial problems with the current system. His proposed budget, meanwhile, is a picture of reduced revenue and swollen pockets of hidden spending. The lip service about draconian clampdowns will hardly solve the problem, particularly in the eyes of the international markets that are studying the administration for signs of commitment to closing the budget deficit.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/opinion/avoiding-the-real-challenge.html

2005-02-08,A Transcontinental Challenge,"A TRANSCONTINENTAL CHALLENGE -- The troubled carrier Independence Air said yesterday that it would start low-fare nonstop flights to the West Coast this spring, plunging into transcontinental routes, the most fiercely competitive market in the domestic airline industry. Independence said that it would begin flying between its hub at Washington Dulles International Airport and San Diego on April 4 and to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., on May 1, using new 132-passenger Airbus A319 aircraft. The low-fare carrier, which began independent service in November 2003 after operating as a regional jet service for United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, has been struggling financially. Last month, its load factor -- the average percentage of seats sold on each flight -- was 45.7 percent, well below the average of 70 percent to 80 percent of competitors. Transcontinental flights have ""always been part of the plan for Independence Air,"" said Rick DeLisi, a spokesman. He said the strategy was to promote low-fare transcontinental flights to passengers connecting to Dulles from airports on the East Coast. Another low-fare carrier, America West, recently abandoned the transcontinental flights that it introduced in 2003, citing intense price-cutting by competitors. Since it dropped out of that market, America West said, some of its competitors' transcontinental fares have gone up by as much as 130 percent. It is not clear if Independence Air's plans will set off more fare wars.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/business/a-transcontinental-challenge.html

2005-02-08,Hemingway Recycled,"Ernest Hemingway, right, just keeps churning them out, it seems. Kent State University Press will publish an unabridged version of one of his last manuscripts in September, six years after a shorter version, edited by his son Patrick, was released to generally poor reviews. ""Under Kilimanjaro,"" the new version of a novel chronicling a safari trip to Kenya, reinstates the content expurgated from ""True at First Light: A Fictional Memoir,"" released in 1999 by Scribner. That book, at 319 pages, was on the New York Times best-seller list for four weeks. The unabridged version will top 500 pages, said Will Underwood, director of the Kent State press. Since the mid-1980's, at least three previously unreleased Hemingway works have been published, including ""Garden of Eden,"" ""The Dangerous Summer"" and ""True at First Light.""

2005-02-08,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Intel To Ship Dual-Core Chips,"Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company, said yesterday that it would begin shipping its first two dual-core chips in the second quarter and had already briefed its largest customers on the technical details. The announcement offered the first details of Intel's plans for moving to dual-core design, which puts two processing engines on a single piece of silicon, giving the chips a huge increase in performance. The change is possible because of Intel's move over the last few years to more advanced manufacturing processes that permit more circuitry to be squeezed into a given area. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said last year that by 2006 about half the company's chips will be based on the dual-core design, and last summer it scrapped plans for a faster Pentium 4 chip in favor of the new design.

2005-02-08,Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Biogen Reports 4th-Quarter Profit,"Biogen Idec, the biotechnology company, said yesterday that it had a fourth-quarter profit of $48.4 million on sales of its Avonex and Tysabri treatments for multiple sclerosis. Net income was equal to 14 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $4.03 a share, or $990.6 million, a year earlier, said Biogen, based in Cambridge, Mass. Revenue jumped to $586 million. Biogen merged with the Idec Pharmaceuticals Corporation in November 2003. Sales of Tysabri totaled $3.12 million in the drug's first weeks and may help Biogen gain market share as growth of the eight-year-old Avonex slows. Tysabri, approved in November, is the most expensive multiple-sclerosis therapy on the market, costing about $23,000 a year. Biogen released its results after markets closed. The shares fell 80 cents, to $66.15. Excluding merger-related costs and other items, the company was expected to earn 36 cents a share, the average estimate of 29 analysts in a Thomson First Call survey.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/business/technology-briefing-biotechnology-biogen-reports-4thquarter-profit.html

2005-02-09,"Paid Notice: Deaths   COX, LAWANDA FENLASON","COX--LaWanda Fenlason, who passed away February 2, 2005, in her home in New York City at the age of 95, was one of the most distinguished, respected, and influential historians of her generation. Her books and articles on Abraham Lincoln, emancipation, and Reconstruction had a profound impact on historical scholarship and became classics that are read by historians in the twenty-first century. She had also resided many years in Bethel, CT. Born in Hoquim, Washington, on September 24, 1909, LaWanda Fenlason earned her B.A. at the University of Oregon in 1931, a masters from Smith College in 1934, and her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941. At Smith, she studied with Merle Curti, the pioneering social historian whose commitment to social justice deeply influenced her. Curti became a lifelong friend. In 1940, Cox came to New York City, where her husband, John Cox, accepted a teaching position at City College and she a position at Hunter College. Except for a brief stint at Goucher College in Baltimore (1944-46), she was a member of the history faculty at Hunter and the City University of New York's Graduate Center until her retirement in 1971. She was a legendary teacher at Hunter, influencing two generations of students there. As a doctoral student at Berkeley, Cox studied with John Schuster Taylor, the economist who collaborated with the great documentary photographer Dorthea Lang to study of the plight of the impoverished agricultural workers who migrated to California to escape the ravages of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. Taking up Taylor's challenge, Cox completed a pioneering study of agricultural labor in the United States as her dissertation. Cox's work on agricultural labor led her to study the plight of former slaves in the post-Civil War South and, ultimately, Reconstruction policy and politics. Her scholarly writing dramatically revised understanding of Reconstruction. Civil rights was the era's defining issue, she demonstrated, not merely a product of Republican vindictiveness toward the South or a smoke screen to obscure the party's efforts to advance the interests of big business. The most complete and eloquent statement of her position came in Politics, Principle, and Prejudice, 1865-1866: Dilemma of Reconstruction America, which was published in 1963 by the Free Press and won the American Historical Association's John H. Dunning Prize. Subsequent work, including Reconstruction, the Negro, and the New South, published by Harper & Row in 1971, extended the argument to emphasize the farreaching--if hotly contested--changes Reconstruction era civil rights policy effected. Cox was also a highly influential Lincoln scholar. In Lincoln and Black Freedom, which appeared in 1981, she boldly challenged the reigning scholarly consensus that held that Lincoln was, at best, a reluctant emancipator. Cox argued that Lincoln's circumspect and indirect style of leadership--while highly effective in advancing the cause of black freedom--had misled historians about his commitment to emancipation and critical role in achieving it. While acknowledging the role African Americans themselves played in ending slavery, her characteristically meticulous research and careful reading of the sources made a compelling case for Lincoln's pivotal role in emancipation and commitment to civil rights for the former slaves. Throughout the 1980s, Cox remained an active scholar, conducting research and publishing essays that examined the demise of Reconstruction and the nation's failure to achieve substantive freedom for former slaves. She also conceived and guided the Symposium on Emancipation and Its Aftermath, which met annually in New York City from 1979 to 1989. A lively forum, it offered an opportunity for scholars to present workin-progress and served as an incubator for a number of important studies that appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. Failing vision brought an end to Cox's historical research and writing in 1989. Nevertheless, in a career that spanned almost fifty years, she left an indelible imprint on the field of Reconstruction, Lincoln studies, and American history more generally. While some of her contemporaries published more, few produced scholarship that equaled hers in its originality, depth of research, analytical power, and enduring significance. Few historians of any generation can equal the crisp lucidity of her writing and analysis. And perhaps no historian was as generous in nurturing the work of young scholars. She was preceded in death by her husband, John Cox, and is survived by her niece, Joan Mason of Los Angeles.

2005-02-09,Metro Briefing | New York: Bronx: 2 Officers Cleared Of Abuse Charges,"In separate incidents in the Bronx, two men have pleaded guilty to falsely accusing police officers of using excessive force to obtain confessions, a police official said yesterday. Jose Peralta, 26, accused officers of the 41st Precinct of burning his arms and striking him with a stick to elicit a robbery confession after arresting him in November 2002, said the official, Capt. Tim McCarthy of the Internal Affairs Bureau. Investigators reviewed a videotape of the robbery confession and noticed that there were no burns on Mr. Peralta's arms at the time of the confession, and he later admitted that he had been burned by a fellow inmate and not by the police, Captain McCarthy said. In a separate incident, Andrew Facey, 19, accused officers in the 47th Precinct of sexually abusing him after arresting him on a trespassing charge in September 2004. He pleaded guilty last month to a charge of filing a false report, Captain McCarthy said. Since 1997, there have been 30 allegations of excessive force by police officers, and 5 of those have resulted in arrests, Captain McCarthy said.

White & Case LLP acknowledges with great sorrow the death January 27, 2005 of our longtime colleague and dear friend Thomas M. Ramseur, a retired partner of the Firm. Tom Ramseur was a member of White & Case for 30 years until his retirement in 1986. He was an outstanding lawyer in the Firm's corporate department, renowned for his dedication to his clients. For a generation of White & Case lawyers who followed him, Tom was the embodiment of a mentor. He sought out young partners and associates, took an abiding interest in their work and careers, and imparted wisdom and knowledge about the law, serving clients and the community of lawyers who comprise this firm. Today, the ranks of White & Case are filled with those who recall affectionately the lessons, values and friendship he extended so generously to others at every rank and position. Clients regarded Tom as a trusted adviser intensely devoted to them. Practicing in an era of generalists, Tom epitomized the ""renaissance"" corporate lawyer, handling all manner of complex financial transactions: tender offers, refinancings, mergers and acquisitions, all with equal authority. For three years in the late-1960s, Tom headed the White & Case office in Paris. In leading the Firm's original non-US office, he was one of those who laid the foundation for what would become White & Case's global mission. Tom Ramseur also made a lasting mark beyond his profession. He served his nation with valor as an Army lieutenant in World War II, performing the perilous duty of target-spotting in light aircraft behind enemy lines to guide artillery strikes against enemy positions. He was an accomplished steeplechaser, having ridden at age sixteen in the Maryland Hunt Cup, the most venerable of American timber races. He excelled as a student at The Hill School, Princeton University and the Columbia University School of Law. For all his accomplishments, Tom Ramseur is best remembered at White & Case for his generous and genial spirit and his unwavering devotion to his colleagues. The values and principles he imbued will remain part of the fabric of White & Case for years to come.

Fradkov. Just 136 of 450 deputies showed up, and 112 of them voted against Mr. Fradkov's government, far short of the simple majority needed to force it to resign.

They either canoed, or they walked. If they canoed, they might be able to land at Hanakapi'ai or Kalalau Beaches, two of the spots on the steep Na Pali Coast where white sand and blue water actually meet. But if the water gods were restless, as they often are, far more distance might need to be covered before a safe harbor could be reached.

2005-02-11,The Listings; CAROLYN DORFMAN DANCE COMPANY,"Manhattan dance fans are notorious for their lack of curiosity about what goes on west of the Hudson River. But choreographers are working there, too, and sometimes that distance from the hectic world of New York dance can be a very healthy thing. Carolyn Dorfman, who is based in Union, N. J., seems to have benefited from the distance, for her work glows with the quiet authority of someone who burrows comfortably into material that interests her, whether fashionable or not. Trained at the University of Michigan and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Ms. Dorfman does a lot of teaching, some of it as a guest at the Limon Institute in Manhattan. She has also worked to develop dance in New Jersey institutions. She is probably best known these days for dances that explore Jewish lives and legacies. A humanist, she offers her audiences the dance equivalent of a cherished book of family photographs. There will be other kinds of pieces on the program presented by the 23-year-old Carolyn Dorfman Dance Company this weekend, one of them by Aidan Treays, a guest choreographer from England. But Ms. Dorfman's new ""Odisea"" will chronicle the journey of 23 Jews fleeing persecution in mid-17th century Brazil for the unfamiliar world of New Amsterdam (New York City). Her 2002 ""Echad (One)"" examines ideas about humanity and individuality in the light of writings on pre-biblical life, the Jewish liturgy and evolving theology and philosophy. The dancers' bodies, above, will very likely look sculptured, as a group forming a flow of images that directly communicate emotions like hope, resignation, uncertainty and joy with the chewy simplicity of good bread. (Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 p.m. , the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, west of Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.)

2005-02-11,The Listings; BRIAN STOKES MITCHELL,"With his heroic baritone and dashing stage presence, Brian Stokes Mitchell has been called Broadway's last leading man in the tradition of Alfred Drake and John Raitt. His performances in the revivals of ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""Man of La Mancha,"" and in City Center's Encores series (""Do Re Mi""), as well as assorted Gershwin tributes, have lent the swashbuckling archetype a modern slant. Glinting through all the heavy lifting are an innate ebullience, a sense of humor and a strain of tenderness. In ""Love/Life,"" his cabaret debut at Feinstein's at the Regency, traditional Broadway chest-beating is kept to a minimum, except in a commanding version of ""The Impossible Dream"" at the end of the show that rolls through the club like a clap of thunder echoing in the mountains. Backed by a quartet whose reed player, Lou Marini, adds moody urban brush strokes to the pop-jazz arrangements, Mr. Mitchell, above, explores his jazzier inclinations. The singer adapts an Al Jarreau-influenced vocal playfulness into his intense character-driven performances, forging his own style of Broadway jazz singing with improvisatory fills. Slipping in and out of various characters, he becomes a pimp (an ominous version of Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale""), a child (Joe Raposo's ""Bein' Green"") and a joyful new father (Maury Yeston's ""New Words""). His club appearance, which continues through Feb. 19, just might be the cabaret debut of the decade. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212)339-4095. Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows, $30 at the late shows.)

Mitt Romney of Massachusetts was posturing for a national audience of conservative Republicans when he came out strongly for a ban on some of the most promising stem cell research planned at prominent institutions in his state. The governor urged the State Legislature yesterday to prohibit the creation of human embryos for the purpose of research. That would make it illegal for scientists to extract stem cells from very early embryos -- microscopic clusters of cells, really -- that would be created in a lab and destroyed by the extraction process. A ban would not only block cutting-edge research, but could also lead to an exodus of the very best specialists to California, where such research has been endorsed by a referendum and backed by up to $3 billion in bond revenues.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/opinion/stem-cell-politics-in-massachusetts.html

2005-02-11,The Listings; 'UPON FURTHER REVIEW: LOOKING AT SPORTS IN CONTEMPORARY ART',"The interaction of sports and society gets lively coverage here -- in video, photography and other mediums -- by nine artists. All are quite aware that sports today is a global industry reflecting the pressures and politics of contemporary life. And their art ranges from spoof to deadly serious as they explore its impact on participants, fans and the world at large. The competitive hustle of sports today is amusingly sent up by Lee Walton, a conceptual artist, who pits himself against the basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal. For every free throw attempted by Shaq in the course of the current N.B.A. season, Mr. Walton tries one himself -- at a special basketball hoop set up in the gallery -- hoping to beat Shaq's percentage. The results are carried on Mr. Walton's Web site (viewable in the gallery). Basketball is also the topic in ""He Got Game,"" above, a fool-the-eye photograph by the performance artist Robin Rhode. Having made a crude chalk drawing of a basketball hoop on the flat pavement, he accomplishes a slam dunk Ã  la Michael Jordan while lying down; that is, he's arranged himself on the pavement next to the drawing so that it seems he's putting the ball right through the hoop. The most chilling of the entries is ""Black September,"" a video made by the Swiss-born artist Christoph Draeger. A reconstruction of the hostage-holding and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich by Palestinian terrorists, it focuses on a dorm room where the action took place, interspersed with real cuts from the television reportage. ""Upon Further Review"" (a title taken from a football referee's mandate to reconsider a controversial call after watching its instant replay on television) makes a refreshing change from the rah rah of much sports depiction.

""In the theater, you have the great possibility of confronting people where they are most troubled, most confused and most desirous of some kind of patterns for the chaos"" Arthur Miller, 1978. We, his colleagues, though saddened by his loss, are emboldened by his courageous life and will strive to continue creating patterns that make sense of the chaos. Our deepest sympathies to his loved ones at this difficult time.

2005-02-14,Exploring Radicalism In a Romantic Composer,"""Brahms the Progressive"" is the title of a fascinating essay by Arnold Schoenberg, first presented as a lecture in 1933. At the time Brahms was generally regarded as a Classicist among the generation of late German Romantics. In his essay Schoenberg claims Brahms as a model for his own blend of radicalism and tradition. He argues that listeners should not be snookered by the Classical trappings of the Brahms symphonies and chamber works. With his daring use of irregular phrase lengths, his unconventional approach to structure and, most of all, his boldly chromatic and experimental harmonic language, Brahms was a true progressive, Schoenberg asserted.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/12/arts/music/exploring-radicalism-in-a-romantic-composer.html

Walgreen has strongly opposed the shift to mail order, and in 2003 said it would not sign new contracts with companies that have mandatory mail-order drug policies for their employees. Fearing that Walgreen would drop it as a customer, G.M. decided to stop doing business with Walgreen as a pre-emptive measure.

In 105 intelligence reports received during the five months preceding the attacks, Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda were mentioned 52 times, according to the commission, which faulted the F.A.A. for not doing enough to heighten security.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/12/opinion/a-vital-job-goes-begging.html

This month, the president of the Los Angeles guild, Daniel Petrie Jr., had a videoconference with Herb Sargent, president of the New York-based Writers Guild East, to ask that the West be paid half of all East Coast dues. He cited a long-dormant 1954 provision and free services provided by the West. In a letter to members this week, Mr. Petrie wrote, ""Between the misdirected dues and the free help, we are subsidizing W.G.A. East to the tune of more than $1 million a year."" Outraged, the East Coast union rejected the demand and this week took its complaints public. ""It's extortion,"" said Warren Leight, the East Coast guild vice president. ""And you don't negotiate with extortionists."" The matter will be mediated by April 10 and, if no resolution is reached, will proceed to more formal arbitration. The two unions recently ratified a three-year contract with the Hollywood studios, which gave writers no increase in fees for the lucrative DVD market, but provided increases in health coverage.

2005-02-14,THE TRENTON GAS PARTY?,"As New Jersey residents and elected officials brace themselves for an ugly budget season of deficits, spending cuts and tax increases, another problem is looming: growing pressure to raise its gasoline tax this year. The Transportation Trust Fund, which uses the state's 14.5 cent-per-gallon gas tax to build and maintain New Jersey's overloaded system of roads, bridges and rail lines, is expected to run out of money in June 2006. During the past five years, a succession of governors and legislative leaders from both parties have considered -- and scuttled -- plans to replenish the fund either by increasing the gas tax or by devoting revenue from other parts of the budget. But with the fund teetering toward insolvency, state officials must find a solution or risk losing $1 billion in federal transportation aid that is allocated to match state contributions. All those years of deferring the problem mean that by next year, New Jersey drivers could face sticker shock at the gas pump: as much as a 15-cent-per-gallon increase proposed by some transportation experts and commuters groups.

Knoedler & Co. in New York from January 1971-February 1985 where he produced many important exhibitions. Born in the Bronx, he combined his love of art and sports since childhood. He graduated from Evander Childs High School, worked as a cartoonist for Walt Disney in California, drew cartoons for the Long Island Daily Advocate, and in 1942 became the sports editor of the Northside News. He served as a cryptographer in the U.S. Army, later returning to New York. He joined Art Flynn Associates, a public relations firm, where he handled clients including the New York Giants and became the 18-year-old Willy Mays' legal guardian. Later, he did public relations for ABC-TV's ""Wednesday Night Fights."" In 1966, he returned to his primary interest in the fine arts; in 1967 he formed a partnership with the Boston art dealer Warren Adelson. It was from that time that Jack Tanzer went on to establish an exceptional career in the art world commencing with his first important client and subsequent personal friend, Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., whose great and varied art collection later became the core of the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va. Tanzer later gave his collection of Pre-Columbian art and his Warhol portrait to that institution.

For one thing, it's an engaging piece of writing. For another, the questions Jacobs asks get at issues that authors, publishers and readers often put to us about our choice of reviewers. Jacobs humorously proposes that reviewers ""be vetted like candidates for a Homeland Security post."" As it happens, the Book Review does take precautions before making assignments. Has the reviewer written previously about the author -- or vice versa? Have the two had personal or professional dealings? Occasionally we get burned, but in most cases reviewers are forthright about volunteering information they suspect may be compromising. One writer recently turned us down because she'd lunched with the author once, and he had picked up the tab. Another passed because she feared her friendship with the editor who acquired a particular book might cloud her judgment. As is clear from Jacobs's essay, he and the reviewer, Joe Queenan, had no prior history. Queenan simply disliked Jacobs's book, which was his prerogative; strong reactions are the prerogative of every reviewer who writes for us.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/books/arts/up-front.html

2005-02-14,Inside the List,"SMARTY-PANTS: If the name Ann Brashares means nothing to you, you probably don't have a teenage girl in your house. Brashares, who is 37 and lives in New York, has published two enormously popular young-adult novels, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" and ""The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,"" both of which read like episodes of ""My So-Called Life"" that have been flecked with pixie dust. (Her books are No. 2 in a combined ranking on the children's series list, which appears this week on Page 18.) Brashares's novels are about four close friends who negotiate the final years of high school with the help of some slightly magical jeans. (What's magical about them? They fit each of the girls, who have different body sizes, perfectly.) The third novel in this series, ""Girls in Pants,"" is just out. It includes a list of the rules the girls have concocted to govern the use of their empowering pants, and it's a list that captures a bit of Brashares's crisp comic tone. Rule No. 2 reads: ""You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky."" Yet these books don't shy away from weightier issues, among them sex. Here is Rule No. 4: ""You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence)."" Brashares, who worked in publishing before writing her first book, is the product of a pretty good education: she attended the Sidwell Friends School in Washington and was a philosophy major at Barnard. The young women in ""Girls in Pants"" have more than bluejeans and boys on their minds, too.

2005-02-14,Clang!,"Behold the slam dunk, the pulse-quickening, throw-it-down, in-your-face signature move of the National Basketball Association. The dunk is a declaration of power and dominance, of machismo. In a team game, an ensemble of five players a side, it is an expression of self. In a sport devoted to selling sneakers, the dunk is a marketing tour de force, the money shot at the end of every worthy basketball sequence. (When you see the shoes in the 30-second spot, what is the wearer of those shoes always doing?) Next weekend in Denver, the cultural moment that is the N.B.A. All-Star Game will take place, an event set annually amid a weekend of concerts, lavish parties and showy displays of fashion. On such a big stage (and with defensive standards momentarily relaxed), the game itself is sure to be a veritable dunkathon, a string of self-satisfied throw-downs by the league's biggest stars. If I had my way, at the conclusion of the game the dunk would be taken out of commission. Banned as a first step toward rescuing a game that has strayed far from its roots, fundamentals and essential appeal.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/magazine/clang.html

Those chaotic days are reconstructed here with a lively eye for detail: from mirrorless dance studios and enthusiastic but poorly trained students to the author's political coming-of-age amid revolutionary upheaval. Last year our critic, Katha Pollitt, said that Guillermoprieto (at right) ""uses dance as a lens through which to explore the aspirations and injustices and contradictions of a whole society. It's a fresh and lively perspective.""

This is the first time in nearly 16 years that a single studio has had a box office trifecta, Sony executives said. (Universal did it in September 1989 with ""Sea of Love,"" ""Uncle Buck"" and ""Parenthood."") This weekend Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" (Warner Brothers) kept fighting strong with $7.6 million, bringing it up one spot to No.4, and ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" (Disney) opened at No.5 on sales of just over $6 million.

The company also lowered the prices of its Athlon 64 chips for desktop and notebook PC's by as much as 34 percent and cut its Sempron value chips 6 percent to 19 percent. But in a twist, it also raised prices slightly on a handful of processors, including a pair of Athlon MP server chips and a Sempron for desktop PC's. Most of the Opteron price moves resulted in cuts of 18 percent or more. The chip maker lowered prices on Opteron 800 processors, chips it designed to fit into servers with four or more processors, by up to 25 percent. The Opteron 848, for example, went down 25 percent, to $873, from $1,165. Advanced Micro enacted some of the biggest price changes in its Opteron 200 line for dual processor servers and workstations.

2005-02-15,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Agilent Posts 45% Profit Increase,"Agilent Technologies, the world's biggest maker of scientific testing equipment, said yesterday that first-quarter profit rose 45 percent as sales of biological and chemical instruments increased. Net income climbed to $103 million, or 21 cents a share, in the period that ended Jan. 31, from $71 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue at the company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., rose less than 1 percent, to $1.66 billion, from $1.64 billion. The chief executive, Edward W. Barnholt, relied on the company's life sciences and chemical analysis businesses to help Agilent post its sixth consecutive period of net income after seven quarterly losses. Agilent's chip-making clients pared orders last year to work off inventory gluts, Mr. Barnholt said in December. Agilent said it expected second-quarter revenue of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes, of 18 cents to 23 cents a share. Excluding some costs, first-quarter profit would have been 20 cents a share, topping 19 cents, the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Shares of Agilent rose 30 cents, to $24.02. Mr. Barnholt, who oversaw Agilent's spinoff from the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1999 and 2000, will retire March 1. William P. Sullivan, the company's chief operating officer, will succeed him.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/business/technology-briefing-hardware-agilent-posts-45-profit-increase.html

2005-02-15,Expense Account Alert,"EXPENSE ACCOUNT ALERT -- Almost half of the business travelers in Europe and the United States who were questioned in a survey released yesterday by American Express say their companies have tightened travel-spending policies over the last two to three years. More than a third say their travel and entertainment expense accounts are getting greater scrutiny. With good reason, apparently: more than a third believe it is either ""somewhat"" or ""quite"" common for business travelers to submit expense accounts with ""one or more completely false or bogus charges."" But most road warriors also disapprove of such fraud. Those in the United States expressed the strongest support (77 percent) for careful audits of expense reports and receipts, while 72 percent in Britain agreed, as did 70 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France. For all their stepped-up vigilance, companies do seem to be loosening up on restrictions against traveling in style. In a survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, the proportion of corporate travelers who reported their employers restricted the class they could travel on fell to 50 percent last year from 56 percent in 2002. The decline reflected a better economy and ""a departure from severe travel restrictions"" put into effect after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the survey said.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/business/expense-account-alert.html

In every avenue of his engagement with Parsons, he maintained a close interest in the life of students and the academic standards for programs. This kind of broad and deep history with an institution is rare, and Henry Wolf's high standards and determined ideals will continue to have profound influence at Parsons and throughout New School University. We convey our heartfelt condolences to his sister Joan Slawson.

Separately, Palestinians fired a mortar in the Gaza Strip that landed near an Israeli military base, but caused no injuries.

In an effort to give the players fresh insights into the scientific nature of falling in love in the two comedies, which involve all manner of love matches, Michael Boyd, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, has enlisted the services of Liz Dawson of the London Neuro Psychotherapy Group, which integrates psychotherapy with neuroscience. As part of the rehearsal regimen, she will explain that during the first stages of a relationship, a chemical, beta-phenylethylamine, similar to one found in chocolate, is released into the brain, touching off the irrational behavior of being ""madly in love."" Negative thinking and rational judgment are blocked, furnishing a scientific basis for the expression ""love is blind.""

2005-02-16,PILOTS SEEK TO BLOCK CHANGE IN UNITED'S PENSIONS,"The Air Line Pilots Association asked a United States Bankruptcy Court in Chicago to block a plan by United Airlines to suspend some pension payments to retired pilots. Judge Eugene R. Wedoff will hear the association's motion on Friday. Last week, United said that it would suspend nonqualified payments to about 3,000 retired pilots. The payments are in addition to the pilots' basic pension benefits. In some cases, the nonqualified benefits are as much as one-third of a pilot's retirement compensation. The airline's move last week came after the Pension Guaranty Benefit Corporation said it would seize control of the pension plan for United's pilots, rather than allow the airline to terminate the plan. United, which filed for bankruptcy in December 2002, wants to terminate four employee pension plans and replace them with 401(k)-style retirement programs, a move that would save millions of dollars annually. United Airlines, a unit of UAL, is based in Elk Grove Township, Ill.

A spokesman for Mr. Wilder, a former governor of Virginia who became mayor on Jan. 2, said the bodyguard brigade, an idea promoted by Chief Rodney Monroe of the Richmond Police Department, would cost about $200,000 less than the metal detector system.

On Jan. 14, Mr. Soo had been brought to the county jail, where he confronted guards, banged his head and bit himself, officials said. Three days later, he was discovered with a braided rope made from his paper gown, and was returned to his cell naked, William J. Maer, a jail spokesman said. On Jan. 20, he had tried to hang himself with material from his jail mattress, Mr. Maer said. Mr. Soo was later sent to Ann Klein Forensic hospital for evaluation but discharged after 19 days, and sent back to the county jail, where he died less than a week later. A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that Mr. Soo had been arrested for overstaying his tourist visa, but was also a suspect in a series of sexual assaults in South Korea. His death is under investigation by the immigration agency's inspector general and by New Jersey authorities.

Kohl-Wells, a Democrat, had said that while insults to women's chastity -- including calling them hussies or strumpets or publicly bringing their purity into question -- were not welcome, the law was an outdated relic of sexism. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives. Eight other states have similar laws on their books, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

2005-02-17,National Briefing | South: Georgia: Capping Medical Malpractice Damages,"Contending that the cost of lawsuits in the state had forced obstetricians and gynecologists to leave their practices, Gov. Sonny Perdue signed into law a bill that caps noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases at $350,000 total from all health care providers involved in a case and $350,000 each from up to two medical facilities. Under the law, plaintiffs who seek damages for emergency medical care in an emergency department or obstetrical unit must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the health care provider showed gross negligence. They formerly had to show simple negligence by a preponderance of the evidence. Doctors' expressions of mistake or apology will not be admissible as evidence.

2005-02-18,The Listings; 'SHOCKHEADED PETER',"Sucking your thumb may not seem like such a terrible offense. But in ""Shockheaded Peter,"" the gloriously ghoulish pocket musical that has returned to New York after a short -- but much talked-about -- run in 1999, the punishment (always death) never really fits the crime (meanness, not eating your soup). So when Conrad, played by a puppet, disobeyed his mother, a sinister man with big scissors paid him a visit and chopped his thumbs off. Performed on a booby-trapped doll's house of a set, the slyly ironic show, which has the highest body count of any production in the theater district, is filled with the kind of gothic tales that will delight kids while scaring them witless. A broken-down master of ceremonies (played by Julian Bleach) from the Boris Karloff finishing school of charm narrates the imaginative musical, introducing himself with typical understatement: ""I am the greatest actooor who ever existed,"" he bellows. The slyly self-parodic show, which has already gained a cult following in London, is based on the sing-songy verse of the 19th-century doctor Henrich Hoffman, an influence on other writers of twisted tales for kids like Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl. This stylish adaptation -- which features the seductive songs of the Tiger Lillies, whose grimacing falsetto-voiced front man Martyn Jacques (above right with Mr. Bleach) plays a mournful accordion -- provides an antidote to the bland and benign family-friendly entertainments on Broadway that are about as fun as eating your spinach. Which, by the way, is highly recommended for children looking to make it to adulthood.

2005-02-18,The Listings; MARK KOZELEK,"In years past, a solo concert from Mr. Kozelek, above, would have meant a roomful of fans hoping to hear songs by the longtime band he leads, Red House Painters. But this concert will probably attract a roomful of fans hoping to hear songs by his other band, Sun Kil Moon, which released a gorgeous debut CD in 2003 called, ""Ghosts of the Great Highway"" (Jetset). It might be the best album of Mr. Kozelek's career: a calm but fierce collection of slow-building Neil-Young-ish ballads, populated with stubborn fighters and stubborner lovers. These mysterious songs grow bigger and sadder the more you listen to them, thanks partly to the mesmerizing guitar figures lovingly wrapped around his intonations. One of the best songs, a dead-boxer ode called ""Salvador Sanchez,"" appears twice: first loud and frayed, then, at the end, in a hushed acoustic version under the title ""Pancho Villa."" At this President's Day concert, expect Mr. Kozelek to respond to all the requests and shouted praise and unsolicited commentary with mumbled insults: the last time he visited the Bowery Ballroom, he offered to show one fan the inside of his guitar, although it sounded like an offer likely to leave neither the fan nor the guitar intact.

What did register was a dark-haired, slightly built but sinewy male who tore through the dance with spendthrift abandon and a dazzling technique. The choreographer might have been Mark Dendy. The wildness of the solo rules out the cooler art of John Jasperse and Ben Munisteri, with whom Mr. Keigwin has also performed. Then came his eerie portrayal of a vulpine Nijinsky in Mr. Dendy's ""Dream Analysis,"" and the dance, yearning and pyrotechnical, that he created and performed in Mr. Dendy's ""I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now, and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed."" Today, Mr. Keigwin and his choreography seem to be everywhere, in programs by Keigwin + Company and in his witty burlesque-style Keigwin Kabaret. So it is no surprise that he is opening the five-week 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project festival at the Duke on 42nd Street. Mr. Keigwin injects a revivifying dose of blithe high spirits into an often rather solemn art. His festival program includes the New York premiere of ""Natural Selection"" (above with Mr. Keigwin and Nicole Wolcott) and his signature ""Mattress Suite,"" a duet whose blend of wry humor and the immense sadness of dashed hope is typical of Mr. Keigwin's humane approach to dance. (Keigwin + Company performs tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Manhattan, (212)239-6200 or www.92Y.org.

2005-02-18,The Listings; AARON SPANGLER,"You don't see much wood carving in elite Chelsea galleries. An antiquated craft with little relevance to modern technologies of communication or to a competitive, fast-paced contemporary art market, it is too hard to learn and takes too much time to do well. So it is exciting to come upon the large, intricate reliefs carved from broad, three-inch slabs of maple and painted black by Aaron Spangler. Mr. Spangler, who is from Minneapolis, lives in Brooklyn and is here having his second solo exhibition in New York, uses his extraordinary technique to elaborate profusely detailed, darkly comic visions of rural, post-apocalyptic ruin. The scenes appear to be set in a remote, Appalachian region where wrecked buildings, crashed cars and trucks and abandoned appliances litter the densely forested landscape. There are other more fantastic elements, too, like the giant ears of corn and the many tire swings hanging from high branches in ""Imperial Trees"" (above). There is something Medieval and a little fanatical about Mr. Spangler's work, as though its author were a backwoods prophet carving his own Book of Revelations. Drawing closer, you search for narrative clues about what has caused these disastrous scenarios, but few if any are forthcoming. What you do discover are many more details and a more immediate sense of the sculptor's hand. Mr. Spangler is not a fussy finisher; he leaves things a bit rough and this creates a magical tension between the raw material and the epic fantasy.

2005-02-18,"In Mont-Tremblant, Quebec","If you're dreaming of a weekend getaway to Courchevel or St. Moritz but can't stand the falling dollar -- or the flights -- consider an alternative: Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. Since 1995, the Intrawest skiing corporation has spent more than $400 million on the formerly sleepy Canadian ski resort. Today, Tremblant, the highest peak (2,871 feet) in the beautiful Laurentian range, boasts European charm with North American comforts. Founded in 1939 by Joe Ryan, a Philadelphia industrialist who dreamed of making the Laurentians a destination for skiers from the United States, Tremblant has 94 downhill trails, 13 lifts, 628 skiable acres and picture-postcard views from every angle. The pedestrian-only ski village resembles Quebec City, with steep mansard roofs and brightly painted shutters framing dormer windows. Tremblant's steep cobblestone streets are lined with chic bistros and lively bars, along with dozens of boutiques and galleries. NANCY M.

The exorcism is to be performed by a nondenominational minister with a man he has been working with for some years, and the station said the man had been cleared by two psychologists. But the Bishop of Monmouth, a spokesman for the Episcopal Church in Britain, said: ""This is not the kind of ministry that should be done on TV.

Last night, the police identified the victim as Rashawn Brazell, 19, of Bedford-Stuyvesant. He was identified after the police traced a fingerprint to an arrest for possession of marijuana, the only arrest on his record. Investigators could not say whether Mr. Brazell had been reported missing before the discovery of the remains, or how long they had been at the tracks. Another bag, containing tools, drill bits and what appeared to be blood, was found near the remains, investigators said, but it was unclear whether the two discoveries were connected. Neighbors at Mr. Brazell's apartment building said that he worked at a clothing store in Manhattan and lived with his mother and stepfather. He was last seen by his family on Monday, a neighbor said.

In only her freshman year of posing, Querelle, a 19-year-old Dutch model, has worked with Mario Testino for British Vogue, Steven Meisel for Italian Vogue and Mario Sorrenti for W, not to mention advertising campaigns for Prada and Miu Miu. Her personal style -- a spirited, gaudy mix of mainly vintage looks -- directly influenced not one but two creative powerhouses at the Paris spring collections. Marc Jacobs has said that his multicolored, circus-theme collection for Louis Vuitton was inspired by what Querelle wore to a model casting. ""Marc likes bright stuff and a mix of different styles, which is what I wear every day,"" Querelle says, modestly acknowledging her influence. According to Querelle's booker at City models, Jean Paul Gaultier at HermÃ¨s was also smitten and asked her to keep on the makeup that she walked in with, a look that the top makeup artist Stephane Marais applied to the other women in the show. From head to pointy 60's stiletto toe, Querelle is truly one to watch. LEE CARTER",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/magazine/style/the-remix-querelle-a-muse-you-can-use.html

These days, the nontoxic supermascaras that are volumizing the market have been joined by a bumper crop of falsies, lash extenders and glosses, all designed to enlarge those peepers. Highly anticipated: fur fakes from Falsettos, an eyelash line from Scott Barnes, who designed Jennifer Lopez's red-fox pair for the 2001 Oscars. His challenge is using recycled fur.

Even Bidoun's lighter subjects -- the cultural significance of Norma Kamali harem pants, a perfume by Osama bin Laden's half brother Yeslam, the Los Angeles-based Palestinian designer Rami Kashou -- are treated with varying degrees of seriousness and humor.

2005-02-21,Unintelligent Design,"Recently a school district in rural Pennsylvania officially recognized a supposed alternative to Darwinism. In a one-minute statement read by an administrator, ninth-grade biology students were told that evolution was not a fact and were encouraged to explore a different explanation of life called intelligent design. What is intelligent design? Its proponents maintain that living creatures are just too intricate to have arisen by evolution. Throughout the natural world, they say, there is evidence of deliberate design. Is it not reasonable, then, to infer the existence of an intelligent designer? To evade the charge that intelligent design is a religious theory -- creationism dressed up as science -- its advocates make no explicit claims about who or what this designer might be. But students will presumably get the desired point. As one Pennsylvania teacher observed: ""The first question they will ask is: 'Well, who's the designer? Do you mean God?""'",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/magazine/unintelligent-design.html

Thirty years later, her spirited romps have aged about as well as Beta tapes. Her come-hither sense of bourgeois style, however, has stood the test of time. In a season filled with innuendo and flirty femininity, her garden-party dresses, A-line skirts and sheer halter tops feel remarkably up to date. Derek Lam's lychee prints are parfait for a Bangkok soiree; ditto for Proenza Schouler's palm-frond chemises and flowing gowns with peekaboo bras. But Veronique Branquinho truly captures the sensuous essence with slinky dresses, loose knits, fringed wraps and gold maillots. Branquinho's show was bookended by a tableau of long-haired girls on rattan peacock chairs (above), which our heroine favored for lounging in various stages of undress.

I have a foxier figure, like Rachel Hunter, so I love bumster jeans, diamante-studded G-strings and clacky moooles.""

Born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Dr. Goudsmit earned his M.D, there in 1931. In 1933 he and his wife Hellen came to the US, where each earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cornell Medical College (1936). His training in Internal Medicine was at the Mayo Clinic. Beginning in 1939 he was Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; and during WWII he was a medical officer on Iwo Jima with the Army Air Corps. He practiced medicine in Youngstown, OH, taught at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, and served as the first president of the Ohio chapter of the American Society of Internal Medicine. His vision and leadership led to the founding of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 1964 (for which he was honored last June). In the late '60's he left private practice to assume a role as Oncologist at the Dearborn VA Hospital. Later he became Chief of Surgical Oncology at the Minneapolis VA Hospital. At age 70, Noldus enrolled in Divinity School. For a time he was Associate Minister at the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis. He then combined his love of medicine and theology by becoming a hospital chaplain. He was a wonderful pianist, an avid hiker, an active cyclist and cross-country skier. After he moved to Rochester, NY, in 1998, he continued to attend numerous medical meetings and traveled extensively. He enriched our lives with his wisdom, kindness and vitality, as well as his warmth and optimism. We are grateful for his example of a life well lived.

For this issue, the 64-year-old photographer, three of whose books are pictured at far right, shot the ""Like a Virgin"" fashion feature (Pages 202 to 209). While the images of young Japanese models wearing the pretty white clothes of spring portray a certain innocence not often associated with Araki's work, the project was not, in fact, an extreme creative departure. The shoot took place at a former ""love hotel"" in the Shinjuku neighborhood of Tokyo, a building that is close to the artist's heart and work -- a place, he says, where you can feel something of both death and life. Araki also took with him some specimens from his collection of plastic dinosaurs and lizards, a signature flourish that appears in the photographs in a ""Where's Waldo?"" manner. A new series of his work, ""Kaori,"" featuring the model Kaori, is at the Reflex New Art Gallery in Amsterdam.

Where one was once expected to wear a signature desinger piece for a couple of years before mothballing it, it is now newly permissible, for example, to reanimate a six-year-old Pleats Please if the extraordinary folds of Lanvin's spring collection compel one to do so. A bowas-dress by Viktor & Rolf might inspire the resurrection of a Vivienne Westwood gown with a giant wilted bow from 1994.

This had a certain ring to it, yet it was a ring I couldn't help feeling I had heard before and would hear again. So I resisted, successfully.

""I think one cuff is beautiful, but two make twice the statement,"" says Wyatt in her honeyed drawl. The longtime couture client would almost be derelict not to own a pair. Verdura's founder, Duke Fulco di Verdura, designed the originals in 1936 for Coco Chanel, who loved them so much that she rarely removed them. Like Chanel, Wyatt wears hers day and night. ""They look as wonderful with a black cashmere sweater and trousers as they do with a white gown or cocktail dress,"" Wyatt says.The Maltese crosses on her bracelets are detachable, so she can wear the gold, pearl and coral ones either on the cocholong cuffs shown here (cocholong is a white stone exclusive to Russia) or on a pair she owns in carnelian. ""At the end of the day I'm just a very practical girl. I take off the Maltese centers with a little screwdriver that came with the cuffs. In the summer I usually wear the white pair. In winter, the coral and gold on the carnelian is a knockout.""Verdura fits each cuff (prices start at $12,000) to its owner's wrist and lets her decide where on the wrist she'd like to wear it. ""I like mine to be a bit looser,"" Wyatt says, ""so I can wear them under a sweater."" The famously svelte socialite adds with a chuckle, ""My waist size might change, but hopefully my wrists will stay the same.""

The new look is more Jayne Mansfield than Heidi Klum -- not unlike the relatively modest two-piece number modeled by Babette March on the first Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover. Granted, this was hot stuff back in 1964, when the mini was starting to revolutionize fashion, and decades before the little Brazilian stringy thingy became the norm. Carolina Herrera's boy-cut has pinup appeal, while Yohji Yamamoto's for Y-3 is more befitting the figure of the swimmer Jenny Thompson. But any way you cut it, the bikini is going to be big, requiring so much fabric, it's like getting four pieces for the price of two.

Of all her pieces, which have names like Kept Woman and the Heiress, Lane's best-seller is her cashmere jersey panties, which she was prompted to design after reading that Coco Chanel was the first designer to use cashmere wool jersey for outerwear (it was considered suitable only for undergarments at the time). Cut from a knit that's made exclusively for her by Loro Piana, Lane's whisper-soft briefs, which range from $78 to $135, come in a thong, a boy short and what she calls ""the big-girl panty.""

The novel, about a Midwestern girl's experiences at an elite East Coast boarding school, makes its first appearance this week at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list. Sittenfeld, who is 29, says she wasn't prepared for the book's reception. ""I saw 'Prep' as an underdog book,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""There wasn't exactly a bidding war for it. My agent sent it to 15 publishers before Lee Boudreaux, an editor who was then at Random House, loved it and bought it."" There are a lot of reasons ""Prep"" is resonating with readers, says Daniel Menaker, Random House's executive editor in chief -- he cites the book's eye-catching cover, and the fact that the novel addresses timely and complicated class and race issues. ""But most important,"" he says, ""the book happens to be terrific."" After a first printing of 16,000 copies, there are now some 70,000 copies of ""Prep"" in print; Paramount recently bought the film rights. Sittenfeld's original title for her novel was ""Cipher,"" and she is now glad she was talked out of it. ""People thought it must be a murder mystery,"" she said. Before publication, she came up with a long list of other potential titles -- including ""Class Day"" and ""The Privilege Thief"" -- before settling on ""Prep."" ""The title was Lee Boudreaux's idea,"" Sittenfeld said. ""It came to her as a kind of vision.

Then she noticed something weird -- among the listings for the dolls, she recalls, were ""all these pictures of babies."" Of course, these were not actual babies being auctioned. They were reborn dolls. ""Reborning"" is the name that has emerged for a curious process of altering and enhancing a baby doll to look and even to feel as much like a human baby as possible. Gernand decided she had to buy one. Once she got it, she decided she had to make one. Soon she started selling her reborn dolls through eBay as well as her own Web site. (Occasionally the dolls are sold at fairs and the like, but the market is mostly online.) Recently she listed a doll that she named Alexandra, and the highest of the 21 bids was for $510.

One such is Liesl Schillinger, who has written 16 reviews for us in the past year, on books ranging from a history of the chess queen to the new novel by Larry McMurtry and the latest manifesto by Ann Coulter. A voracious reader since childhood, Schillinger is the daughter of academics -- her father taught Russian, her mother taught journalism. ""I grew up in university towns in the Midwest, mostly West Lafayette, Ind. and Stillwater, Okla.,"" she wrote in an e-mail message. ""I had a reading list my mother drew up, from the time I was 5, a book a week. I never thought to question the list."" Her reading wasn't confined to English. At age 10, she began studying French alongside college students at Purdue, and later added Spanish, German, Italian and Russian. It was good training for fact checking at The New Yorker, the job she landed after she graduated from Yale in 1988. She has been at the magazine ever since -- she's now an arts editor there -- apart from a brief stint in Russia editing the English supplement of Moscow magazine. Schillinger went over in the spring of 1993 and stayed, she recalled, ""till the end of the summer, living in workers' apartments in a far-flung district on Moscow's eastern periphery, in the middle of a grove of apple trees"" -- digs as exotic in their way as the five-star establishment she writes about this week in ""Hotel Confidential"" (Page 23).

On Sunday CBS edged out ABC in households, but ABC, as usual, was No. 1 in the 18-to-49 demographic because of the strength of ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" in that age group.

The package laid out in the president's budget proposal touches on many of the right issues, but it is underfinanced and poorly conceived -- and dead on arrival in Congress, which has signaled its intent to ignore crucial provisions of Mr. Bush's proposal. The White House, which failed to push for adequate funds for its last big education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act, has only itself to blame for failing to do the necessary preparation before unveiling this big idea. Nevertheless, Congress should understand what's at stake here. As school reform grinds to a halt in Washington, American students are falling further and further behind their peers in Asia and Europe, where universally accessible quality schools are producing highly skilled workers at a rate that far outstrips schools in the United States.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/23/opinion/high-school-reform-round-1.html

By separating the male and female contestants, above, during this semi-final round, the talent show has changed its structure to fix the voting irregularities that plagued last spring's installment, when some of the more talented contestants exited early. Tonight's results will show how well the fixes are working. CBS, usually the winner on Mondays, was No. 1 at both 9 and 10 p.m. in the Nielsen overnight ratings, with ""Two and a Half Men"" and a 90-minute ""CSI: Miami.""

A lawyer and entrepreneur, Mr. Barliant founded Barliant & Company during the Depression and turned it into a leader in equipment for the food processing industry. He made his first visit to the Technion in 1988 under the guidance of his longtime Chicago friend, past ATS president Leonard H. Sherman. Subsequently, along with his late first wife Dorothy and her mother, he dedicated the Dorothy Turner Barliant/Nathan Turner Dormitory. Later, he was a leading supporter of the Florence and Jack Bellock Southern Region Dormitory and provided generously for the Technion through a major planned gift. Along with his second wife Tania, he was recognized with the Albert Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor. We extend our sincere condolences to Tania, Mr. Barliant's daughters, Diana J. Barliant, Barbara Sonnenblick and Laurel Burgess, and the entire Barliant family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.

2005-02-24,"Arts, Briefly; Trouble for UPN Comedies","It's been a tough season for UPN's comedies. The network's sitcoms on Monday and Tuesday nights, geared toward an African-American audience, have sharply declined over all since last year, whether because Nielsen Media Research undercounts minority viewers -- a complaint that UPN and CBS have raised, and Nielsen announced this week it is trying to address -- or because the shows have simply become less popular. But what is undeniable is that two of them, ""All of Us"" and ""Eve,"" have been doing even worse in recent weeks because they are in direct competition with the Tuesday installment of ""American Idol."" This week's ""All of Us"" brought in about 2.3 million viewers, and ""Eve"" attracted about 2.2 million. Comparing those numbers to ""Idol"" in the same time period (28.10 million) is absurd, but the sitcoms' closest competition, WB's ""Gilmore Girls,"" more than doubled their ratings in both viewers and households. Because of the steamroller that is ""Idol,"" Fox won Tuesday's Nielsen race in all important measures by a wide margin.

The move does not affect the corporate debt of each airline. Standard & Poor's airline analyst, Philip A. Baggaley, said that holders of aircraft debt could face difficulty demanding repayment if a terrorist attack occurred, if fuel prices spiked from their record levels or if the airlines were forced to shed their pension liabilities.

2005-02-25,The Listings; SHANNON HUMMEL AND CORA,"I was startled, the first time I saw the choreography of Shannon Hummel, by how completely the dancers in her all-female company, CORA, seemed to own the pieces that they performed. And what they performed was often like a vivid, true short story, a mix, perhaps, of Eudora Welty and Elizabeth Bowen. Her pieces, whether solos or group dances, evoke whole small universes of emotions and relationships, both simple and complex. Ms. Hummel's new ""Elsewhere,"" which will be performed by CORA this weekend, addresses the dilemma caused by hope and its propensity for both sustaining and destroying. ""Elsewhere"" (featuring Julie Betts, above, with Anna Smith) might be a barren wasteland, a lush forest, an ocean or a desert, she has written. The piece itself delves ""into the lives we live or fail to live when we focus on what may happen rather than what is."" Ms. Hummel began her career performing with companies in Washington and Atlanta before receiving a degree in dance from James Madison University. She formed CORA in 1997 and has helped develop, and worked in, programs intended to bring dance to isolated, often rural communities where exposure to the arts is often limited. In her finely wrought dances, you seem to hear the voices of the anonymous women in those communities, and they are indistinguishable from the big-city voices of her dancers and their New York audiences.

Yesterday, the board of the Teatro della Scala Foundation fired Carlo Fontana, the company's general manager for more than a decade, and named its current artistic director, Mauro Meli, in his place. The move prompted Milan's culture commissioner, Salvatore Carrubba, to resign in protest, and La Scala's labor unions have threatened new strikes after forcing cancellation of Tuesday's opening of a new production of Tchaikovsky's ""Queen of Spades."" The crisis, however, was not unexpected. Mr. Fontana had long been in conflict with Riccardo Muti, above, La Scala's all-powerful music director, over programming. He has also been blamed for the company's financial problems. Officials have estimated its current deficit at $2.6 million, but other reports put it much higher. Last week, board members said they hoped to reach agreement with Mr. Fontana on his early departure; when no agreement emerged yesterday, he was summarily dismissed.

2005-02-25,The Listings; SACRED MUSIC IN A SACRED SPACE,"This series at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola is best known for choral concerts and organ performances, but tonight St. Ignatius will present its first ever piano recital. It's hard to imagine a more appropriate work with which to break fresh ground than ""Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus"" by Oliver Messiaen (above), the remarkable French composer whose music, like the stained glass windows of a cathedral, reflects a deep Catholic faith through an often dazzling array of colors. Messiaen wrote the monumental ""Vingt Regards"" in 1944, reflecting a new interest in the piano spurred by his contact with Yvonne Loriod, a brilliant young pianist at the Paris Conservatory who would later become his wife. At once Catholic in its faith and catholic in its appeal, the two-hour work consists of 20 brief ""gazes"" of the infant Jesus, viewed from theological perspectives (the Father, the Cross, the Virgin) and mystical ones (time, the heights, the spirit of joy). It offers a glorious compendium of Messiaen's musical world: chords that pulse with an inner radiance, ecstatic emotions transcribed with the same fidelity as the famous birdsongs that pierce the music's fabric. Most of all there is a deeply sensual (and deeply French) feel for instrumental color. Tonight, the pianist Paul Kim, a specialist in Messiaen, will perform the work in its entirety. He is not widely known in New York, but his bio includes an impressive endorsement from Ms. Loriod herself, who purportedly praised his playing as ""perfect in every way.""

In the letters, written while Shelley was a student at Oxford, he pretends to be a clergyman as he elaborates on his theories of atheism, which became a tenet of his career as a rebel poet. In one letter he wrote, ""Christ never existed. The fall of man, the whole fabric indeed of superstition which it supports can no longer obtain the credit of Philosophers."" Shelley and Hogg were subsequently expelled from Oxford after distributing a pamphlet titled ""The Necessity of Atheism"" to bishops and heads of colleges. Mr. Jackson said, ""The owner, who was left the trunk of manuscripts by her next-door neighbors, had thought of selling them in a garage sale before contacting Christie's."" The letters are expected to fetch $38,200 to $57,300 when they go on sale June 8 in London as part of a sale of valuable printed books and manuscripts, which will also include a copy of Christopher Columbus's letter announcing his discovery of the New World, printed in 1494, and a copy of Galileo's ""Siderius Nuncius"" (1610), including the first account of astronomical discoveries made with the telescope.

2005-02-25,The Listings; URS FISCHER,"The ever-irreverent young Swiss artist Urs Fischer is given to big sculptural surprises. For his first gallery show two years ago, he cut a gigantic ellipse out of the back wall of the Gavin Brown gallery, then on West 15th Street, and leaned it against an adjacent wall as if it were a monumental blank thought balloon. For his second show at Mr. Brown's gallery, now on Greenwich Street in the West Village, Mr. Fischer began in a more constructive mode, building a modest but life-size alpine cabin out of sourdough bread, using different kinds of loaves as cobblestone walls, half timbers and shingles, plus expanding foam, screws and a wood infrastructure. Set on a large patch of Oriental carpets, ""Bread House,"" above, was definitely startling. It inserted a slightly barbed bit of Old World sentimentality, wholesomeness and craft into the pristine confines of the art gallery; Heidi's grandfather lived here. But Mr. Fischer wasn't finished. Two weeks after the opening, with the focaccio shingles drying and curling away from their beams, he simply knocked off the entire roof and left it strewn about, like so much sawdust. He also added, as a bit of wildlife, four parakeets that, too young to fly, hop around the interior. The perky tribute to tradition has become a half-ruin in a crunchy desert, a monument to ephemeralness and artistic license, and a disruption of business-as-usual in the art world. After all, even though it is made of the staff of life, ""Bread House"" is, in the parlance of the 1960's, also made of money, as in ""dough"" or ""bread."" Two large inkjet paintings further contrast the Old and New Worlds with montaged images of a tough-looking street in Long Island City and a classic Swiss beer hall, replete with wood paneling, bulls-eye glass and a ceramic stove. The titles -- ""A Shovel and a Hole"" and ""A Novel and Its Novelist"" -- seem to sum up Mr. Fischer's basic approach, which is to get beneath the surface of things. Appropriately, tunnel-like networks of thick black lines edged in searing red burrow across both paintings.

These three former Lawrence residents probably didn't share too many Boulevard Pale Ales in the noisy collegiate pubs along Massachusetts Street. Separately, however, each represents a key element of this laid-back university town's vibe. Senator Dole, a former University of Kansas student and namesake of the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, embodies the Great Plains values and civic engagement that date back to the town's origins before the Civil War. Mr. Burroughs, the Beat Generation writer and a presence in Lawrence the last 16 years of his life, is the uncontested symbol of its bohemian and creative set. And Mr. Chamberlain, a product of the university's legendary basketball program, remains among the most towering figures in a sport that has obsessed and defined Lawrence for a century. Add the lovely campus (above), many funky shops and a top-notch regional music scene, and Lawrence, a leafy city of about 80,000, seems to bulge beyond its borders.

An appeals board composed of exhibitors and studio representatives voted 9 to 3 to overturn the decision after a presentation in which Mr. Tucker and Mr. Robbins argued that the profanity was not gratuitous in the film's wartime context and that teenagers approaching recruitment age should be allowed an unvarnished view of war's realities.

""This should really clear the way,"" said Ed Durkin, special projects manager for the carpenters union, which holds 2.7 million Citigroup shares in its $30 billion pension fund. ""There are about seven other companies challenging the proposal, but the Citigroup arguments cover most of what the others are saying,"" he said.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/business/company-news-sec-says-citigroup-must-hold-shareholder-vote.html

At least 6 of the 13 men who received the falsified documents from March to September 2004 are in the United States illegally. In an indictment unsealed Thursday, the Justice Department identified Mohammad I. Shalash, 30, of Cincinnati, as the ringleader of the operation that used Tammy Black, 40, a bureau worker in Cincinnati, to produce the licenses or identification cards, and to sell them to immigrants for up to $300. Ms. Black used expired visas to complete the license applications, court records say. Mr. Shalash remains at large; a judge released Ms. Black without setting bond.

Although Edith disliked Lawrence for having, she thought, caricatured her brother Sir Osbert in the novel, as the gin took its effect on each of us, I boldly assured her that the offending book was not actually the work of Lawrence but of Truman Capote.

Since it is the custom of journalists in Cannes rarely to refer to movies by their titles, this one, originally made for Italian television and directed by Marco Tullio Giordana, was usually mentioned as ""that six-hour-long Italian miniseries."" For those few who had seen it, the extravagant running time was a badge of honor; for those who hadn't (like me) it was an excuse. Though the description is perfectly accurate, it seems at once to enlarge the film and to belittle it. Having seen it recently, from start to finish, for the third (and I hope not the last) time, I prefer to think of ""The Best of Youth"" as a Roman epic.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/movies/romans-fate-in-six-short-hours.html

2005-02-28,Inside the List,"JUICED: If you want to sell an addiction memoir these days, the conventional wisdom holds, you'd better be prepared to lay out the lurid details -- the more gruesome the better. (James Frey's book, ""A Million Little Pieces,"" published in 2003, may be the one to beat for a while. It opens with the author missing four front teeth, wanted in three states and covered with ""a colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood."") Koren Zailckas has cannily taken the opposite tack. Her new memoir, ""Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood,"" which enters the hardcover nonfiction list this week at No. 10, is so poised and elegiac that she comes off as the Norah Jones of her plastered generation. No crime sprees, strip club jobs or spooky detox centers here. ""Smashed"" goes down with a slow, genteel burn. Zailckas, who is 24 and grew up in one of Boston's middle-class suburbs, coolly explains how she began drinking at 14, had her stomach pumped a few years later, threw up a lot, lost her virginity while blacked out and finally got sober at 22. Not a pretty story, but not a Belushi-level meltdown, either. Zailckas's failure to flame out in a more spectacular fashion has bugged some critics. As Rebecca Traister put it recently in Salon: ""A reader could easily close the book and say, 'That was her big drunken girlhood? I got drunker than her! Where's my book deal?' "" Zailckas got her $150,000 book deal, I suspect, because she is often a terrific writer, and one who knows how to frighten parents. ""I haven't met a girl yet who hasn't been interested in drinking,"" she writes in her memoir. ""Every time I've seen a bottle emerge, girls have followed it the way children follow Browning's Pied Piper of Hamelin: with small feet pattering, wooden shoes clattering, little hands clapping and little tongues chattering.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/books/review/inside-the-list.html

""Let's welcome Howard Dean and give him the groundswell of grass-roots support he needs,"" Kerry wrote enthusiastically, urging his followers to contribute to the party. The turnabout here, if anyone really stopped to think about it, was mind-bending. It was Dean, after all, who pioneered the Internet campaign, and it was Dean who had to urge his supporters, the most motivated in the Democratic universe, to accept Kerry as their nominee. And although Kerry emerged as the safer, consensus choice for president, it was Dean, alone among Democrats, who retained the personal loyalty of street-level activists and millionaire donors. Kerry urging his fans to give it up for Dean was like the leader of a warm-up band begging the audience to wait around for U2.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/magazine/what-dean-means.html

2005-02-28,An Early Lesson in Prada,"These days, women aren't letting a little pregnancy get between them and their Prada. Chic mothers-in-waiting are now altering their own designer clothes to fit burgeoning bellies -- sewing elastic triangles into hip seams, adding stretch panels to waistbands or lengthening hemlines on blouses. ""When I was pregnant, I figured I may never be able to fit into my nice clothes again, so why not alter them?"" said Jeanine Lobell, the creator of Stila Cosmetics, who stitched elastic panels into the waistbands of Helmut Lang pants and the seams of Dries van Noten blouses. ""When you find a designer you like, you don't want to have to give the clothes up because you're pregnant."" For like-minded do-it-yourselfers, the Denim Doctors at Fred Segal in Los Angeles will tailor jeans to fit an expanding girth for a fee of $30, while Liz Lange Maternity sells elasticized, pull-up versions of jeans by labels like Citizens of Humanity and Earl for $175 a pair. Bella Bands -- soft, stretchy tubes for the waist ($25.95 at www.pregnancystore.com) -- can provide wardrobe extensions by letting women wear regular skirts and pants, unbuttoned and unzipped. And Dynasty Tailors in New York City (212-679-1075) and Susie's Custom Design in Los Angeles (323-462-5520) will maternitize clothes with elastic triangles or panels for $35 to $45 a garment.

2005-02-28,"Arts, Briefly; Reality Runway Ratings","Last Wednesday, Bravo's ""Project Runway"" brought in the channel's best ratings for the 2004-5 season, as well as a win for the night among all ad-supported cable stations. An audience of 2.01 million viewers watched Jay McCarroll, below, win the fashion design contest, beating both the favorite, Kara Saun, and the reviled villain of the show, Wendy Pepper. The judging was based on the three contestants' runway shows during New York's fashion week. Among the three, Ms. Pepper, the scheming dressmaker from Virginia, was abolished first by Heidi Klum, the host. ""You're out -- auf wiedersehen,"" said the deadpan Ms. Klum, using her standard elimination tagline. Mr. McCarroll will receive $100,000 to start his own fashion line, along with a spread in Elle magazine. The show began in December and became a word-of-mouth hit: the number of viewers who saw the finale was almost five times the number of those who watched its premiere. Whether there will be a second season of ""Project Runway"" is unclear: because of the expected split between Disney and Miramax, the show's producer, its renewal is still being negotiated, Mediaweek reported.
