The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour. No matter how many of them you get past, there’s always another one around the next bend.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/magazine/driving-living-reality.html

At his first faculty meeting four years ago, Brown fretted that his school had become, like many American universities, overly dependent on a single source of money — roughly a fifth of tuition revenue came from Chinese students. “I saw our reliance on China as a risk,” says Brown, noting that 800 or so of the university’s nearly 5,800 Chinese students attend the business school. “At the time, I was concerned that China could pull the plug on students coming to America. But then the U.S. political landscape shifted, and we were vulnerable to changing visa and immigration policies here, too. Both were threats we could not control.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/magazine/one-of-americas-most-vital-exports-education-never-goes-abroad-but-it-still-faces-threats.html

History runs through many of this week’s recommended titles, from the fall of Rome to the birth of Islam to Michelangelo in 16th-century Constantinople. If Paris in the 1960s is your bag, Patrick Modiano has you covered. If you’re interested in the Harlem Renaissance but have never read Jean Toomer’s seminal 1923 novel “Cane,” which helped catalyze that movement, you might add it to your list of resolutions. If you’re curious about the Philippine-American War and its lasting impact — inescapable in the Philippines, mostly ignored in America — then Gina Apostol’s novel “Insurrecto” offers an improbably fun, and funny, guide. (When you’re done with that, maybe pick up another satire out of Asia. Yan Lianke’s “The Day the Sun Died” or Gengoroh Tagame’s “My Brother’s Husband: Volume 2” both fit the bill.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

At the same time, artists often do more than simply show their work in them; they tweak them or execute substantial makeovers that temporarily turn the galleries into part of the art. Such shows are nearly always on view somewhere in New York’s sprawling gallery scene, and at the moment there are three very fine examples within a short distance of one another in downtown Manhattan.

Little wonder, then, that Yeoh’s portrayal of the imperious mother, Eleanor Young, in the summer smash “Crazy Rich Asians” was so ferocious.

Two days later, culminating a rivalry that commentators likened to the race between Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen to reach the South Pole in 1911-12, Louis Rudd of Britain finished the same arduous journey of more than 920 miles across the frozen continent, surviving brutal winds, whiteouts, crevasse scares and temperatures below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

2019-01-07,Shortcut Cooking From Jamie Oliver,"Clever cookbooks with a limited number of ingredients per recipe are not new, but this one from the chef Jamie Oliver is notable for its ease and verve. Before he gets to the cooking he names his five “pantry heroes”: red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper and two olive oils, everyday and finer for finishing, staples that are not part of the ingredient tally. The book starts with salads, mostly as the center of the plate, and then goes on to simple pastas like one with canned tuna, capers and tiny tomatoes. There are sections on eggs, chicken, fish, various meats (beef dishes are mostly steaks) and desserts. To keep the ingredient count to five, Mr. Oliver bakes with self-rising flour and premade puff pastry and relies on prepared Asian condiments and sauces. With coconut milk and curry paste, you’re on your way to soup. Along with plenty of inspiring shortcuts, there’s a straightforward recipe for potato gnocchi with asparagus, and a six-hour lamb shoulder baked with chickpeas from scratch, not quick at all.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/dining/jamie-oliver-5-ingredients-book.html

The dish for which Mr. Arellano, 24, is best known at his compact market stall is braised beef noodle soup, a Taiwanese specialty. It comes in a deep bowl filled with slices of beef, bok choy, pickled cabbage and his hand-pulled noodles, an art that he has managed to perfect. The broth, which he says simmers for six hours, delivers depth and spice. He speaks Mandarin and has visited Taiwan.

The town, to Tillman, represented a chance for a turnaround. If she was able to get a part-time job at a big-box store, she could put a deposit on a rental apartment and see a psychiatrist for what she suspected was bipolar disorder. She could take steps toward regaining custody of her son from her boyfriend’s mother. “I needed to support myself,” she told me recently.

They decorate their bowers with scores of colorful objects, like flowers, berries, snail shells or, if they are near an urban area, bottle caps and plastic cutlery. Some bowerbirds even arrange the items in their collection from smallest to largest, forming a walkway that makes themselves and their trinkets all the more striking to a female — an optical illusion known as forced perspective that humans did not perfect until the 15th century.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/magazine/beauty-evolution-animal.html

I’ve just seen too many skateboarding movies that either are competition narratives or come off as a bit angsty. There was also a lot of talk among us about taking out any reference to social issues in the promotional materials, whether domestic violence or child abuse, and I was like, “I guess that makes sense.” But I’m torn about the effect that’s had, because on the one hand, the film is doing exactly what I want it to — young people who would go seek out a skateboard film anyway, it seems to be destroying them by the end emotionally. But it has turned off a lot of people, too. I talk to film lovers who say, “I didn’t even watch the film because I saw the word ‘skateboarding.’ ”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/magazine/bing-liu-sees-skateboarding-as-a-tool-for-life.html

When used in a paste or scrub, it is particularly adept at temporarily removing “surface oil and bacteria,” says the New York City dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, and can lead to a cleaner, brighter-looking complexion. Yet, slathering on clay is not always pleasant: The mineral-rich substance has the texture of thick mud, is messy to apply and often becomes dry and flaky when spread on the face. But there is a better way. The latest wave of clay treatments come in innovative new formats — from soft creams to sheet masks to customizable powders — that can help clear out pores with minimal irritation (and frustration). Here, four tips for choosing the best mask for your skin type and schedule.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/t-magazine/best-clay-mask.html

While Green, who founded his brand in 2012, is best known for his utilitarian work-wear-inspired silhouettes, these handmade elements added softness and even a little romance. “Emotion doesn’t mean weakness,” he said. “It can also mean strength.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/t-magazine/craig-green-mens-fashion-week.html

A novel about Somali immigrants in Norway, or a collection of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s precise character studies of expats and emigrants? You’ll find all of those below, along with Paul Collier’s nonfiction book about retaining a sense of community in a globalized world. Closer to home, we offer a couple of food memoirs, and a natural history of the domestic biome that may have you urgently planning your next vacation to a technologically engineered cleanroom facility with a protective suit and a book.

The rest of the book addresses the urgent political matters that have risen in the wake of that night, but it also goes back to cover, among other things, Harris’s tenure as California’s attorney general and her childhood in Oakland as the daughter of immigrant parents: her father an economist from Jamaica and her mother a cancer researcher from India. Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, “I might”), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. “At the expense of sounding immodest,” she said, the book is “really about the work I’ve done already that’s had national impact, and what I hope to come from it.” Below, Harris talks about how she connects personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/books/kamala-harris-book.html

The dramatic volcano would have been an obvious choice of subject for Gall, whose work has focused on nature — from formal gardens to underground caves — for more than three decades. But there, in the ancient city of Syracuse, a surprising fascination emerged: “As I walked through all the narrow streets,” she says, “my gaze was drawn upward to a swirl of moving color, which turned out to be laundry hung out to dry from balconies.” Over the next two years, Gall traveled to seaside cities in Italy, Cuba and Croatia, capturing the movement and forms of hanging laundry and, later, kites. Inspired by the nonrepresentational paintings of Kandinsky and Miró, she pared away all but the essential details, developing abstract compositions against clear blue skies. The resulting series — now on view at Julie Saul Gallery in New York City — is transformative: In image after image, whirling, wind-tossed dish towels, dresses and denim conjure the shapes and colors of blooming poppies and flocks of birds.

Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche. He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share, he said, with his students.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/magazine/tarell-alvin-mccraney-beauty-black.html

What was Salvation Taco is now under the management of Alex Stupak of Empellón, Taqueria and Al Pastor. (Mr. Stupak took over Salvation Taco last year after April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman, who ran the restaurant, left amid a sexual harassment scandal over Mr. Friedman’s treatment of employees.) Though Mr. Stupak has a casual Al Pastor taqueria in the East Village, he says this latest restaurant is not merely a spinoff. “It’s an evolution,” he said. “It’s bar food inspired by Mexico and also by fun lowbrow American food like corn dogs. There’s also waiter service here.” Mr. Stupak said that he had resisted offers to turn Al Pastor into a fast-casual place in airports and food halls, and that he felt this project suited him better. The sprawling space, designed by Glen Coben in conjunction with Mr. Stupak, has a long bar, high-top tables and a pub atmosphere, with dark green walls, vintage photos and tufted leather in one area, with another bar and a game room beyond. “It’s now less fiesta and more tavern,” Mr. Stupak said. The menu will feature tacos, as well as fried-chicken sandwiches, broiled oysters with hoja santa and bacon, Chihuahua cheese sticks, pork fried rice and crunchy corn masa ice cream bars. Breakfast will be served. (Opens Friday) ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

But he also wanted a place where he could cook intimate lunches and host the occasional party (every year, during Paris’s annual Fête de la Musique, he invites up to 500 of his friends into the studio to watch world-renowned D.J.s).

Founded in the early 16th century, it served as Guatemala’s capital for almost 300 years, until 1773, when it was abandoned by crown officials following a series of devastating volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods. In the mid-1800s, agriculturists took note of Antigua’s rich volcanic soils, and the city thrived once again, as a center of coffee and grain production. It was during this period that its canary-colored Santa Catalina Arch, built in 1694 as a walkway for nuns, received its domed clock tower, becoming Antigua’s most iconic monument.

To learn new behavior patterns, first understand the existing ones. “Break your anger down into its component parts,” Tafrate says. Examine specific incidents and ask yourself, What was the trigger? What went through your head and body? What did you want to do in that moment? And what did you actually do?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/magazine/how-to-become-less-angry.html

Today, its youthful energy and deep musical traditions make for a vibrant, often open-air night life, even when it’s not Carnaval (this year from Feb. 28 to March 5). And when it is — well, let’s just say Rio’s version looks like teatime at Buckingham Palace by comparison. Alas, crime rates mean not every stretch of town can be explored at will, but dirt-cheap ride-share services make it easy to get around safely.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/travel/what-to-do-in-salvador-brazil.html

Teetering on the cusp of adolescence, many kids feel that compared with the threat of embarrassment, walking into an open sewer is rather enticing. Yet the freshest fears yield the greatest comedic bounty. True schadenfreude is built on seeing your fellow humans fail with epic splendor. That’s where books come in. Rather than encourage average kids’ bloodthirsty instinct to cheer for the downfall of their friends and neighbors, let them delve into the fiascos of fictional characters. Three funny new novels do precisely that, appealing to kids’ inclination to laugh at others’ foibles and, maybe in the course of things, themselves.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/books/review/meg-wolitzer-holly-goldberg-sloan-to-night-owl-from-dogfish.html

He edited the “Encyclopédie,” for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts.

2019-01-29,Lena Dunham Pays Homage to Her Late Literary Hero Diana Athill,"Diana Athill spent most of her life as an editor, working with titans of literary history. They were mostly male — most anointed titans are — and the challenge of this job was immense enough to warrant a thick memoir, “Stet: An Editor’s Life.” Remarkably, Athill didn’t use the pages to complain, an instinct that would have been easy to understand, but instead to sing the praises of the written word and the people who make it their mission to tell stories. What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader’s life, provided a lifeline. Perhaps her greatest legacy was her refusal to cede to societal expectations as she carved out a persistently unusual world for herself in which the demands of femininity — marriage and children, specifically — were rethought and redefined.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/books/review/lena-dunham-diana-athill.html

But it also means something more poignant: the end of your character’s journey. (At least until the show’s reboot.) While television characters are immortal in a way — living on even after the show is done — when the story reaches its conclusion, so, too, does the time an actor has spent getting to know the characters in that world. When I learned that the fourth season of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” would be its last, I felt sad to have to say goodbye to Kimmy.

Pitching the manuscript to a local government official he thinks might subsidize its publication, the author is at pains to describe it in resolutely anti-commercial terms. Though the area includes the battle sites of both Troy and Gallipoli, there is nothing of historical or touristic interest in the work.

There’s theatrical lighting throughout, from the ground-floor Marquee Bar, specializing in whiskeys, to the dining room, a space called the Oyster Bar, and other dining areas that can be used for à la carte dining or private parties.

That story has many versions, but all of them end the same way: Harel’s legacy is an incalculably long line of cheeses with peach-fuzz soft rinds and creamy centers, wrapped and transported in tiny wooden crates.

Accept that an issue like whether to increase the minimum wage, for example, can have strong reasons on both sides. “I could give very good considerations in favor of my side of the policy,” Mashwama says, “but those might not be relevant in light of the actual reasons my opponent has an opposing opinion.” This is common on social media, he adds; too often, people aren’t listening to one another.

Consider the poem “I Am Learning to Abandon the World”: Although this quiet lyric is elegiac, it doesn’t mourn the inevitability of growing old so much as it accepts aging’s wearisome gradations as stages of self-reclamation.

2019-01-31,How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,"Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/magazine/asghar-farhadis-iran-film.html

Calloway is a 27-year-old with a large Instagram following, built by chronicling her time as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge (picturesque lolling on the banks of the River Cam) and her daily life as a gal-about-town in New York City. Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on “true creative fulfillment.” What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them. A muckraking Twitter thread materialized, scorning Calloway as a “scammer”; she promptly canceled and then uncanceled the tour, all while zapping out flurries of alternately self-flagellating and self-justifying posts on Instagram Stories.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/magazine/creative-work-corporations.html

As far back as the 1860s, a patrician British contingent was spending the cold months in the winter sun here; by the 1960s, the jet set had anointed St. Moritz the hallowed ski spot of wealthy scions and the internationally fabulous. In the town’s handful of streets jumbled along the western banks of St. Moritz Lake, the German- and Romansch-speaking enclave is home to a mere 5,200 citizens, joined by more than half a million glamour-hungry visitors each year. Amid all the dazzle and dizzying prices though, the town’s roots endure: Swiss, snowbound and sports-obsessed. Tourist life remains old-fashioned, revolving around the ski lodges and the storied Kulm, the slope-side Suvretta and the buzz-filled Badrutt’s Palace, the grand hotels where heavy Alpine furniture never goes out of style; piano players still serenade the lounge-dwellers and old- and new-moneyed denizens alike sip champagne under dim chandeliers.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/travel/what-to-do-in-st-moritz.html

It adds a dynamic that you can’t create on your own,” she reflected recently, as she walked through her narrow studio on a misty January afternoon. Her pace seemed surprisingly calm for a designer who was 72 hours out from her show. “It actually hasn’t been that hectic this time around, compared to the first couple of shows that we did,” she added.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/t-magazine/cecilie-bahnsen.html
