2019-09-02,Joshua Wong and Alex Chow: The People of Hong Kong Will Not Be Cowed by China,"HONG KONG — “If we burn, you burn with us.” A famous line in the movie “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay” has been given a new life in Hong Kong’s summer-long protests: It has come to represent the spirit unleashed by hundreds of thousands of protesters. As many commentators have pointed out, the massive, leaderless resistance movement here is a critical front-line battle against the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. A dictatorial party facing domestic and global pressures — especially from the ongoing trade negotiations with the United States — the C.C.P. is getting impatient, apparently. On Friday, it targeted leading activists and politicians in Hong Kong with a round of arrests, possibly signaling that a broader crackdown may be around the corner.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/opinion/hong-kong-protest-joshua-wong.html

In the spirit of Labor Day, revisit this outrageous black comedy about three friends who, despite working hard, are repeatedly tormented by their bosses. Their simmering grievances reach a boiling point when the buddies — Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) — decide to put an end to their misery by killing their higher-ups (played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell). Their scheme quickly falls off the rails, because, well, they’re not experienced killers. And the “murder consultant” (Jamie Foxx) they turn to isn’t much help either. Watch with a grain of salt: In his review, the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that while the movie’s humor “flirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia,” it also draws plenty of laughs.

Now She Wants Them to Swoon.,"In 2012, the indie-folk singer Angel Olsen traveled to a dusty, bat-riddled barn in upstate New York to shoot a video that would prove something of a revelation for her. She went alone, taking two flights from her home in Chicago and rounding up her wardrobe before meeting with two filmmakers, Zia Anger and Ashley Connor. They were three young women equipped with only a Bolex camera, a single light source, two rolls of film and a detailed plan for how to create the effect Olsen wanted: a black-and-white clip that would have her disappearing and reappearing, double-exposed in patches of light. They spent tedious hours drawing lines on the floor to mark out positions, arranging and rearranging the camera and light, and filming, six times, Olsen mouthing the words of “Tiniest Seed,” a haunting waltz on which her voice trembles and flickers like a candle in a dark room. After each shot, they rewound the Bolex and did it again, unable to review the footage on site, hoping the different pieces would fit together, joking about getting rabies from the bats above them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/magazine/angel-olsen-all-mirrors.html

Barnum in “The Greatest Showman,” Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Hart’s 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film “belongs to the accusatory tradition of ‘Ace in the Hole,’ ‘Network’ and ‘Absence of Malice,’ movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion,” he added. “But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-front-runner-and-the-emoji-movie.html

Takeovers and makeovers by Romans, Byzantines, North Africans, Normans and others left their marks as well, influencing everything from religious art to the region’s distinctive savory-sweet-sour cooking style. Much of the ancient city has crumbled since Cicero’s day, though the ruins can still be explored in Syracuse’s celebrated archaeological park and museum. But the main attraction today is the historical center of Syracuse: Ortigia island, a maze of narrow streets, ornate Baroque churches and centuries-old palazzi.

Always on the lookout for fresh voices, the publicist read magazines like The New Leader, Commentary and The Nation, where, a few years earlier, essays and reviews by a man named James Baldwin had begun to appear with some frequency. And what Cole found in the emotionally charged writing were thoughts that sometimes — thrillingly — strained against its own gorgeous, literary, knowing style: Baldwin “read,” but from up high.

In the first episode, Simon, the investigator with Israel’s security agency, the Shin Bet, questions his commander’s decision to give the Israeli public false hope about the fate of the three Jewish boys. Thousands of Israelis had joined the parents of the abducted boys to publicly pray for their safe return. To allow the hopefuls to believe such an unlikely outcome, Simon feels, is to prime them for heartbreak and anger if the boys do, as he suspects, turn up dead. Simon’s commander responds that prayer and solidarity are what the families of the missing need the most. ",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/opinion/netanyahu-boycott-hbos-our-boys.html

2019-09-06,The City Poised to Become Europe’s Next Affordable Creative Haven,"Over the past five years, Albania has been discovered by travelers as that rare thing: a largely unexplored corner of Europe (one with some 265 miles of coastline). The small Balkan country sits just across the Adriatic and Ionian seas from Italy’s heel and a mere 45-minute ferry ride away from the Greek island of Corfu. It’s recently gotten its first high-end waterside resorts, and as the beach town of Sarande and the seaside city of Vlore have become more comfortable, so too has Tirana — the country’s capital, about 22 miles inland with a population of over half a million — grown more cosmopolitan, with new restaurants, shops and galleries joining the almost surrealist pastiche of testaments to the city’s past. For a good example of the way eras collide in Tirana, just visit Skanderbeg Square, recently renovated with new fountains and rosy granite paving, and home to an 18th-century mosque and minaret, a domed Albanian Orthodox church opened in 2012, a set of government buildings that echo the fascist architecture of Mussolini’s Italy and a Brutalist monolith that houses the National Historical Museum.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/t-magazine/tirana-albania-travel-guide.html

They had known each other since the mid-aughts, sharing both a social circle that revolved around Marlow and many wine-world connections: At the time, the two men (with their respective jobs) were among the only buyers in Brooklyn of the kind of biodynamic, organic, natural wine that has since changed contemporary drinking patterns and palates in nearly every city around the world — and which now fills the shelves of Stranger Wines, their Havemeyer Street storefront that opens this week.

2019-09-09,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and ‘WOW’,"MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama “Lady Bird,” she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeth’s crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.) THE FAVOURITE (2018), another historical drama about women scheming for royalty, leads in at 5:55 p.m.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-mary-queen-of-scots-and-wow.html

In the season premiere, Vincent (played by James Franco) inches toward his estranged wife Andrea, whom he left in Season 1, while his twin brother Frankie (also played Franco) continues to display his self destructive streak despite being married and having children. But it’s not only the past that exerts a gravitational pull. The future also beckons. Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a former street prostitute who became a porn film director, disagrees with Harvey (David Krumholtz), a fellow director, about the changes affecting the industry when they travel together to a convention in Las Vegas.

Look for fossils in sedimentary rock, including sandstone, limestone and shale, preferably where the earth has been cleaved by road cuts, construction sites, rivers or streams. Identify hunting grounds by consulting geologic maps and paleontology websites like myFossil. Follow local and federal laws — collecting fossils is largely prohibited on public land. If you approach private landholders, do so cautiously. “People out West with dinosaur bones on their land have had their door knocked a thousand times,” McCall says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/magazine/how-to-find-fossils.html

That man would be Eli Cohen, the real-life Mossad spy who in the 1960s went undercover in Syria and gathered intelligence that is credited with being crucial to Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War. The series, directed by the Israeli filmmaker Gideon Raff, follows Eli Cohen (who is not related to the actor who portrays him) in the early 1960s as he poses as a Syrian shipping magnate. “I saw Eli Cohen, as he was written in the show, as an extreme version of myself,” Baron Cohen said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “The stakes were higher for him, because the price of failure is imprisonment and execution. Eli Cohen was, in that sense, the greatest method actor of the last century.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-the-spy-and-in-the-shadow-of-the-towers.html

Toggling between work and family life can be a challenge no matter your profession, but it’s especially trying for Ray Shoesmith, the contract killer at the center of this series. Outside of work, Ray is also raising a young daughter and trying to foster a new, post-divorce relationship. Played by the Australian actor and writer Scott Ryan, Ray spent the first season both nurturing life and taking it away, easing his daughter into the news that Santa isn’t real in one scene and having a shootout in another. In his review of that season for The New York Times, Mike Hale referred to the show as “another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability — in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and ‘Everybody Loves Raymond.’” The story, Hale added, “deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Ray’s violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor.” Ray will continue straddling that gap in the second season, which debuts Thursday.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-mr-inbetween-and-the-victim.html

Or so went the story that kindly strangers were able to coax out of the young woman who showed up on a cottage doorstep speaking “gibberish” and wearing a dress “in imitation of the Asiatic costume,” as chronicled in a leaflet published later that year. For 10 weeks, she regaled admirers with reminiscences — of a mother with blackened teeth and a bejeweled nose, and a father of such rank petitioners approached him only on their knees — before she was exposed as a cobbler’s daughter and illiterate servant, born Mary Willcocks in Devonshire.

They played Sully and Dushane, two drug dealers whose rise over the course of the two seasons led to rivalry. Their stories halted after the show’s network, Channel 4, canceled it. Five years later, it has been revived by Netflix — thanks in large part to the involvement of Drake, a fan of the show and an executive producer of its third season. The story resumes with Dushane (Walters) returning from exile in Jamaica to go into business with Sully (Robinson), who gets released from prison after a long sentence.

He based the faces on models from Sears catalogs and stock photos, but calls the type a “Redbook Juggler,” after the supermarket glossy that advises women on how to cook, shop and dress. While Currin’s exaggerated compositions blow his figures up to kewpie-doll proportions or deflate them into a jumble of jutting elbows and toothy smiles, he renders each inch of flesh in laborious, glowing brushwork that has earned him comparisons to Dutch masters. He was, in fact, exhibited alongside the celebrated Golden Age Dutch painter Cornelis van Haarlem, at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands in 2011, just two decades after his first solo show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 1992 (where his provocative portraits of bold older women elicited accusations of sexism but nevertheless sold out). Currin’s works still draw that criticism on occasion, but not much that he depicts emerges solely from his own imagination. His subjects wash in from the flotsam of American life — kitschy souvenirs and cringey ads, screenshots and centerfolds — and it’s by polishing this lowbrow commerical imagery with a high-art sheen that he manages to make obvious what others might be happy to ignore about our culture.

In his review of that show for The New York Times, Neil Genzlinger likened it to documentaries “that ramble and lack focus and are more akin to visiting with a topic than to making a point about it.” But Handler has decided to delve back into the subject of race in “Hello, Privilege,” a full-length documentary in which this former talk show host confronts the ways she’s directly benefited from white privilege and the way others experience it. She sets out to meet with ordinary Americans, community leaders and fellow comedians like Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish, to have tough discussions about how those like herself can be better allies to people of color.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-chelsea-handler-and-roasting-alec-baldwin.html

I wore my hair like them, too, shaved low on the sides and back and slightly higher on top with a laser-sharp part engraved on the left.

It was inspired by hotel lounges like the Library at the NoMad hotel. The menu includes popcorn with various seasonings, a mini lobster roll, small curried rouget fish, beef tartare, sliders, tarte flambée and beignets. A number of wines are poured by the glass from large-format bottles. Mr. Bellanca has also adjusted the menu at L’Atelier, making it more seasonal, and trimming some of the portions to be the size of those originally served in France, to permit grazing.

If you’re in a monogamous relationship and want to explore making it nonmonogamous, raise the topic gradually. Conley doesn’t drink, but she thinks these exploratory conversations might benefit from the loosening effects of alcohol. Start hypothetically. For example, ask your partner to name the most attractive famous people. “You could then say, ‘Oh, that person is so hot, if they propositioned you, I’d be fine if you had sex with them,’ ” Conley says. If your partner looks horrified at the suggestion, it doesn’t bode well.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/magazine/how-to-propose-an-open-relationship.html

2019-09-18,What Can Brain Scans Tell Us About Sex?,"Men have a far greater appetite for sex and are more attracted to pornography than women are. This is the timeworn stereotype that science has long reinforced. Alfred Kinsey, America’s first prominent sexologist, published in the late 1940s and early 1950s his survey results confirming that men are aroused more easily and often by sexual imagery than women. It made sense, evolutionary psychologists theorized, that women’s erotic pleasure might be tempered by the potential burdens of pregnancy, birth and child rearing — that they would require a deeper emotional connection with a partner to feel turned on than men, whose primal urge is simply procreation. Modern statistics showing that men are still the dominant consumers of online porn seem to support this thinking, as does the fact that men are more prone to hypersexuality, whereas a lack of desire and anorgasmia are more prevalent in women. So it was somewhat surprising when a paper in the prestigious journal P.N.A.S. reported in July that what happens in the brains of female study subjects when they look at sexual imagery is pretty much the same as what happens in the brains of their male counterparts.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/magazine/sex-brain-scans-men-women.html

The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing’s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots — most of them recent graduates of its own academy — and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot’s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/magazine/boeing-737-max-crashes.html

2019-09-19,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Aniara’ and a Climate Forum,"ANIARA (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This sci-fi drama from the directors Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja is based on a downbeat 1956 poem by the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earth’s atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the story’s protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. “At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable,” Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-aniara-and-a-climate-forum.html

Now She’s Writing for Herself.,"When Jacqueline Woodson’s mother died, late in the summer of 2009, the writer and her siblings had to sort out what to do with the Brooklyn building where they spent much of their childhoods. Their mother bought a three-story townhouse in the Bushwick neighborhood decades earlier, for only $30,000, and by the time she died, a development boom was spilling over from neighboring Williamsburg, driving up values and driving out residents. But Woodson did not find herself dealing with a readily lucrative asset: Because of predatory lending that targeted black homeowners, she says, her mother died owing $300,000, and the house was in foreclosure. “My siblings and I are like, ‘Let’s just short-sell it; let’s just dump it,’ ” Woodson says. But the more she visited the building — traveling across the borough from the Park Slope townhouse she shares with her partner and their two children — the more she felt herself wanting to hold on to her childhood home, one of the first places she lived in Brooklyn after moving from Greenville, S.C., at 7.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/magazine/jacqueline-woodson-red-at-the-bone.html

As a teenager, the designer hung pages torn from fashion magazines on his walls and sought out copies of Vogue Patterns, prompting his grandmother to lend him her sewing machine. Next came the Berkshire College of Art and Design, where the now 40-year-old studied fashion. Yasmin Sewell, then the buying director of the influential London boutique Browns, bought Andrew’s entire Paul Poiret-inspired graduation collection and introduced him to Alexander McQueen, who brought him on as an apprentice in 1999. From there, Andrew designed accessories for Narciso Rodriguez, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan before launching his own line of shoes in 2012. Inspired by the palettes of abstract painters like Robert Motherwell, Pierre Soulages and Conie Vallese, his color-saturated, ’70s-inflected designs caught the attention of the Ferragamo family, who named him head of women’s shoe design in 2016 and its creative director last winter.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/t-magazine/paul-andrew-ferragamo.html

2019-09-20,"T Suggests: Photographs of ’70s California, a Family-Made Olive Oil, and More","Out this month — to accompany a show at the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco — is a beautiful monograph of the work of the photographer Michael Jang. Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera — his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel — he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the ’70s, and there’s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang’s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) — and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that’s not why I find them so compelling. There’s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white — he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols’ Johnny Rotten’s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown’s Miyako Hotel. “Michael Jang’s California” is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.

This June, Keith Raniere, the leader of an organization known as Nxivm, was convicted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, ending a trial that exposed the secretive group’s inner workings. Nxivm presented itself as a personal fulfillment program, but some of its female members say they were recruited into a secret society within the group, known as D.O.S., where they were branded, threatened with blackmail and assigned to have sex with Raniere. It’s no wonder, then, that the operations of the enclave, which prosecutors likened to that of a “horror movie,” serve as the inspiration for this made-for-TV film. Based on the tell-all memoir “Captive,” by the actress Catherine Oxenberg, the film follows Oxenberg’s struggle to free her daughter, India, from the group’s secret society.

But, as Margaret Lyons, a television critic for The New York Times, noted after this year’s nominations were announced, “The variety and flair of the comedy categories — performing, writing, even directing — are just way, way more interesting than the sort of blah drama contenders this year.” Among the newcomers are fan favorites like “Schitt’s Creek,” which is up for best comedy, and “Fleabag,” which was nominated for 11 awards, including best acting and best writing for its creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The event itself will go hostless this year, but Jenny McCarthy, Shannon Sharpe and Kelly Osbourne will co-host Fox’s red carpet coverage starting at 6:30 p.m. Over on E!, Giuliana Rancic and Jason Kennedy will do the honors, beginning at 6 p.m. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-the-emmys-and-criminal.html

Although versions of the piece continue to be produced by a Barolo, Italy-based company called Gufram — which pioneered Guflac, a pliant yet sturdy varnish — this one was from an early production, designed in 1971 by Studio 65, one of several radical design collectives that formed in Italy during an era of tumultuous student protests. Such groups, including Superstudio and Archizoom Associati — influenced by American Pop Art, the films of the French New Wave and the avant-garde works of the Romanian-French playwright Eugène Ionesco — produced thousands of intricate renderings but were rarely able to translate them into actual objects.

But several years ago I added a nakiri, the Japanese rectangular-blade knife designed for cutting vegetables. I have found many other uses for it. Nakiris have become widely available now, in several sizes. Abe Shaw, an entrepreneur who turned his hobby into a Staten Island business, is fanatical about craftsmanship; he sells knives and other utensils from artisans around the world through his companies, Living Steel 626 and Eatingtools. This nearly 6-inch-long nakiri, handmade at Andersson Copra Studio in Sweden, combines heft and tactile beauty, with a sleek blade, a comfortable octagonal handle and a handsome brass bolster.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/dining/nakiri-knife.html

It’s cast aluminum for conductivity, and has a ceramic nonstick interior, a domed lid, an efficient steamer basket and a wooden spatula. It is coated with an easily cleaned matte silicone finish.

They are not sour, though there’s a tantalizing hint in the one that’s seriously dark chocolate through and through.

It offers a solid repertoire for mostly casual home cooking any time, if you don’t plan a deep dive into Asian cuisine. You’ll find Spanish potato tortilla, slow-cooked salmon, crispy scallion-coconut rice, eggplant Bolognese, spatchcocked chicken, crostatas, brownies and chocolate chip cookies.

These days balsamic (good, bad and indifferent) usually gets the nod, but in my pantry the workhorse when I want acidity tempered by mellow richness is good Spanish sherry-style vinegar. It’s an honest product not tricked up with caramel. Kitty Keller, an importer in Oakland, Calif., has some that are new to the American market, and they’re beauties. Copper-colored Mas d’en Gil, from Priorat, south of Barcelona, is more tart than sweet; use it to enliven a quick weeknight pan sauce for chicken or pork. Alvear from Cordoba in Andalusia makes both sweet and dry Pedro Ximenez vinegars; the complex dry one is my preference, especially for a vinaigrette.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/dining/spanish-sherry-vinegar.html

In Dr. Bouchard, that pair finds a person whose expertise can help distinguish demonic possession from run-of-the-mill insanity. The first episode debuts Thursday, alongside two notable new CBS sitcoms: THE UNICORN, airing at 8:30 p.m., which casts Walton Goggins as an obliviously handsome widower wading into the dating pool, and CAROL’S SECOND ACT, at 9:30 p.m., with Patricia Heaton as a retired teacher attempting to make a midlife career pivot into medicine.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-evil-and-sunnyside.html

Immigrant influence — from Chinese dumpling restaurants to Polish grocery stores — has added color and variety to an already vibrant culture of Irish food, crafts and booze. Dip into James Joyce’s “Ulysses” notebooks at the new Museum of Literature Ireland and then relax with a glass of natural wine; shop for modern Irish linen and locally roasted espresso; and follow an into-the-wee hours traditional music session with a next-morning shakshuka (a tomato and egg dish from the Middle East) breakfast. Irish art has always leaned heavily on tragedy, and Dublin’s historic cemeteries and jails are worth visiting for enlightenment into what has fueled the country’s often-melancholy nature. But it’s the local sense of humor — occasionally dark as it can be — that’s what most visitors take away from a visit to the capital.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-dublin.html

In Jean-Pierre Melville’s seminal crime film, Alain Delon plays Jef Costello, a highly disciplined hit man whose life is disrupted when he is seen leaving the scene after killing a nightclub owner. He’s saved from immediate prosecution when the club’s piano player, Valérie (Cathy Rosier), refuses to cooperate with the police. The film reveals little of Costello’s inner life or Valérie’s motivations. These mysteries deepen as the investigation continues and Costello’s ruthless employer circles. Even the film’s violent ending, which seems to promise some resolution, only reinforces its central enigmas.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/arts/whats-on-tv-monday-le-samourai-and-the-silence-of-others.html

How many times had a Paltrow character tried to upgrade the lives of the people around her, just as a matter of taste, like that espresso machine or the matchmaking she tries to do in “Emma”?",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/movies/gwyneth-paltrow.html
