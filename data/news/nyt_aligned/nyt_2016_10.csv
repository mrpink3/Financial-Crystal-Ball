He has teamed up with ESquared Hospitality, and is opening this upscale tavern in the Upper East Side townhouse that housed his restaurant Fishtail, which closed last winter. In its new incarnation, the ground floor is the bar, where an afternoon menu will focus on toasts with various toppings. The second floor has a spacious dining room, a smaller room and a greenhouse garden room that will open later. Mr. Burke’s signature use of slabs of Himalayan pink salt is everywhere, in the food and even to cover some walls. His menu can be counted on for inventive touches; there are scallops with corned beef cheeks, lamb carbonara and Peking pork shank. The executive chef is Ed Cotton.

A Florida nature photographer, Dr. John N. Ott, who has spent 15 years studying the sometimes weird effects of visible and invisible light on plants and animals, reported on his experiments at the 100th meeting of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In one experiment, Dr. Ott placed three-month-old rats directly in front of a color television set. Within ten days, he said, rats protected only by black paper showed abnormal activity, and by 30 days, were extremely lethargic. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 6, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/1966-tv-effects-on-children/

Scarpitta, who was raised in Los Angeles and died in 2007, never quite took off as a postwar pioneer. But then again, he never pursued anything resembling a standard art career: He was an unconventional painter who became an untrained car manufacturer. Opening Oct. 14 at the Luxembourg & Dayan gallery, “Salvatore Scarpitta 1956-1964” will trace his evolution, from his traumatized-looking paintings made with bandages and bulges to a turn in his sculpture toward the mid-1960s in which his automotive fascinations began to spawn racecars, a few of which actually worked (and were actually raced).

2016-10-05,Sarah Jessica Parker Returns to HBO With ‘Divorce’,"Twelve years after the women of “Sex and the City” swilled their last cosmos, Sarah Jessica Parker is returning to HBO with a new series — one that might suggest her alter ego’s long-awaited “I love you” didn’t work out quite as planned. But don’t expect Carrie Bradshaw in the ’burbs. In “Divorce,” debuting at 10 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 9, Ms. Parker plays Frances, an arty type turned corporate recruiter navigating marital purgatory in Westchester County with her husband, Robert (Thomas Haden Church), a flailing real-estate developer, and their two children. But when a friend’s 50th-birthday party turns amusingly violent, life’s niggling disappointments explode into vivid relief, and some serious navel-gazing ensues. The show’s title pretty much sums it up as Frances and Robert deal with each other’s infidelities — hers physical, his emotional — and the flatlining of their union, and conclude that they’re better off apart. If only they could make a clean break. The discourse, achingly knowing and bracingly comical, will ring familiar to fans of Amazon’s “Catastrophe” and its gloriously sniping Sharon Horgan, this series’s creator.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/arts/television/sarah-jessica-parker-returns-to-hbo-with-divorce.html

2016-10-05,It’s Rachel Weisz’s Turn in ‘Plenty’ at the Public Theater,"When the drama “Plenty” was first produced in New York at The Public Theater in 1982, its British playwright David Hare had been active for over a decade but was known, if at all, in America as a plucky newcomer. The year before, Mel Gussow of The New York Times described him as part of a wave of young, politically righteous dramatists, and since then, Mr. Hare has grown into the role of liberal drama’s éminence grise. “Plenty,” a time-jumping drama, remains not only one of his finest and most popular plays but also one of the great modern vehicles for ambitious actresses. The four-time Tony nominee Kate Nelligan originated the role (an English secret agent, who worked for the French resistance, adjusting to a tepid postwar life), which has now been played by Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett. Part of the fun of the new revival, once again at the Public, will be to see how Rachel Weisz follows in their footsteps. David Leveaux directs.

Stan and Jan Berenstain’s 50-year-old series, with its family of bears living in a big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, covers the waterfront of possible toddler experiences: everything from “Trouble at School” to “Too Much Birthday” to “Messy Room” to “Go to the Doctor.” And for that reason, the books are easily deployed by scheming parents like myself to inoculate against potentially unsettling changes that might frighten a 4-year-old. When my wife and I were set to take a child-free overseas trip, we read and reread “Week at Grandma’s” with my son as preparation; when summer rolled around, we pulled out “Go to Camp.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/magazine/how-the-berenstain-bears-found-salvation.html

I make it all up.” The music on “Blood Bitch” is an elemental experience; one can imagine moon cycles guiding rhythms, or the tides inspiring its looping melodies.

Ever curious, Cocker came along to the museum: “I’d heard that they were putting together an exhibition at the studio where I used to record,” he recalls by phone from France. “I liked the way Brett mixed everything together. He seemed to have found a good way to show that type of art that kept the spirit alive. It doesn’t work if it’s too reverential.

2016-10-07,Brutalism Is Back,"IN THE RANK OF UNFLATTERING monikers for an artistic style, “Brutalism” has got to score near the top. Like the much kinder-sounding “Fauvism” or “Impressionism,” it was a term of abuse for the work of architects whose buildings confronted their users — brutalized them — with hulking, piled-up slabs of raw, unfinished concrete. These same architects, centered on the British couple Alison and Peter Smithson, enthusiastically took up Brutalism as the name for their movement with a kind of pride, as if to say: That’s right, we are brutal. We do want to shove your face in cement. For a world still climbing gingerly out of the ruins of World War II, in need of plain dealing and powerful messages, this brand of architectural honesty was refreshing.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/t-magazine/design/brutalist-architecture-revival.html

Trump, through sheer dint of his own bluster, has conducted his own version of this exposé.

If you’re lucky, you start with a blank slate and some time in the future, years later, it may become something like what you had in mind. Gardens are forever evolving and growing, like children to adulthood, and like all things in nature, they can be hobbled by disease, or refashioned for the times or, on occasion, brutally destroyed before reaching maturity — life interrupted. They hold a beauty and a sadness — seasonally, of course, from those early sprouts pushing through the softened earth of spring, to the autumn, when the leaves fade and fall and the barrenness of winter sets in, but also in their impermanence. Gardens continually remind us of our mortality.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/t-magazine/design/louis-benech-french-gardens.html

But Mr. Trent, typically heard strumming a guitar, and Ms. Hearst, chiefly the band’s drummer, can deliver as much punch with a lighter premise, singing in their rafters-raising harmony. “I Know” suggests a sneering put-down of a rival band’s pretensions, while “San Andreas Fault Line Blues” belongs to the ageless category of Los Angeles disillusionment narratives.

He made the first one in response to the 1991 Los Angeles police beating of Rodney King. Mr. Cave’s new installation at Mass MoCA, in North Adams, Mass., is political, too. It addresses more recent lethal incidents of racial violence — the killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin — on an epic scale. Titled “Until” — as in “guilty until proven innocent” — the installation (opening Saturday, Oct. 15) fills the museum’s football-field-size main space, functioning as a kind of walk-in soundsuit, composed of thousands of eye-catching found objects. But Mr. Cave cuts the high spirits with images of guns, bullets and targets. Besides being sculptural, the piece is architectural, meant to serve as an assembly hall/stage, where dancers, singers and poets will perform and community groups meet during the show’s yearlong run.

2016-10-14,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Notorious: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been making the rounds lately to promote a new anthology of her writing, “My Own Words,” which hits the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 12. As you might expect, the interviews have centered largely on Ginsburg’s love of the law, her long, impressive career and the inner workings of the court. But Ginsburg has also become something of a pop culture superstar in recent years, ever since an admiring law student nicknamed her Notorious R.B.G. (a riff on the rapper Notorious B.I.G.). The meme went viral, and now Ginsburg’s stern face and big glasses show up on tote bags, baby onesies and coffee mugs bearing slogans like “The Ruth Will Set You Free.” So when Gwen Ifill talked with her for PBS’s “NewsHour Bookshelf” this month, the first question involved Ginsburg’s newfound status as a folk hero. “It is utterly amazing,” Ginsburg said. “Of course I didn’t see it coming. . . . But I certainly was given a tremendous boost into the public arena by the Notorious R.B.G. When I was asked about it, I said, well, it’s exactly right, because Notorious B.I.G. and I had something in common. . . .

2016-10-17,Kerry James Marshall Is Shifting the Color of Art History,"WE COULD BEGIN IN Birmingham, Ala., where the artist Kerry James Marshall was born in 1955, his father a postal worker whose hobby was buying broken watches, fancy ones — Baume & Mercier, Piaget, Patek Philippe — that he’d pick up in pawn shops for a song, figure out how to fix with the help of books he’d find used, and resell. From that story, we could derive the practical idea that Marshall, a companion on his father’s expeditions from a very early age, saw that something rarefied and complex, in which one had zero training, could be approached, deconstructed and — with education and application — mastered. Or we could begin by talking about Marshall’s older brother, Wayne — one year and nine days older, who, straight out of high school, went to work for the post office like his father and worked there until he retired — Wayne who was always first at everything, whom Marshall was always chasing, from whom he was inseparable except at school where their ages kept them in different grades, Marshall trying to catch up but always falling short, one year and nine days short. From that story, we could understand that Marshall is a man who, from the beginning, has been hustling to get to where he wants to go. Or we could begin in Watts, in 1963, when Marshall was 7, when his family moved there in time for the riots, 12 blocks from the Black Panther headquarters, a neighborhood where he learned things you’re not supposed to know about when you’re a kid. We could talk about how their mailman, a really nice guy, got killed on Marshall’s best friend’s front porch, in a robbery gone wrong, two doors down. How, on another day, coming home from school, cutting through the alley he always cut through, he found three grown women rolling around in the grass of a front yard, stab wounds all over them, stabbed by a young man who’d been discharged from the Army with problems, a man who’d just stabbed his mother, his aunt and his grandmother 70 times. And how, later, when Marshall was voted homecoming king of Jefferson High and was on his way there in his suit for the first homecoming parade in a decade — Jefferson having gotten kicked out of the conference because there’d always been problems — he arrived to find everybody heading the other way: Three people had just been shot on the field, friends of his. That was the kind of world Marshall grew up in, a world where he knew founding members of the Crips, and where a lot of the people he knew are now dead of unnatural causes and have been for a long time. From those stories, we’d be amazed to learn — as he told me in August when I visited him on the South Side of Chicago where he’s been making one masterpiece after another for three decades — that “it didn’t stop me from developing the sense that, still, everything is possible. I was never in despair.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/t-magazine/kerry-james-marshall-artist.html

Half of them were shown two photo lineups, one with an array of white faces and one with black faces. This group was more visually attuned to the white faces. A second group looked at the same lineups after words like “violent,” “crime” and “shoot” flashed on their screens, at the edge of their field of vision. This group of officers’ eyes were mostly drawn to the black faces. In a similar test, using pictures of guns and knives instead of words, a group of white college students exhibited a similar shift in attention.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/magazine/how-bias-went-from-a-psychological-observation-to-a-political-accusation.html

2016-10-18,Should We See Everything a Cop Sees?,"On his first day on the job in the Seattle Police Department, Mike Wagers was invited to an urgent meeting about transparency. It was July 28, 2014, little more than a week after Eric Garner was killed on Staten Island, less than two weeks before Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., and police departments around the country were facing a new era of public scrutiny. Wagers, who has a Ph.D. in criminal justice from Rutgers, was the Seattle department’s new chief operating officer, a 42-year-old civilian in jeans and square-rimmed glasses. He’d left his wife and two kids in Virginia and come alone to Seattle, a city he didn’t know — where it rained but cultural norms, he’d read, didn’t allow you to use an umbrella — because the job was what he called “the chance of a lifetime.” Seattle was the first big-city police department in a decade to have come under what is known as a consent decree — police reform by federal fiat — after a string of violent police actions against black, Latino and Native American people were caught on camera in 2009 and 2010. Wagers and his new boss, Chief Kathleen O’Toole, herself just arrived in Seattle, would use the best new thinking and the best new technology to lead the turnaround. And then Wagers would go home.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/magazine/police-body-cameras.html

The palace, as it exists today, was largely built by Louis XIV, a notoriously epicurean monarch whose sumptuous meals included everything from deep-sea oysters and lobster aspic to wild duck croquettes and morel mushroom soufflé. Now, though, the culinary reputation of Versailles is in the midst of a delicious revival as talented chefs open restaurants so good they’re pulling Parisians.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/travel/five-places-to-eat-in-versailles-france.html

Fleeing to the apartment where his mother lives, he’s barred entry, because she is convinced Adan has hocked some of her jewelry.

True to its English-language title, the movie is thoroughly and utterly creepy, partly because Mr. Kurosawa knows how to slither under your skin, but also because his movies transcend the classifications (and limits) valued by critics and content providers. “Creepy” certainly works — looks and feels — like a horror movie, but it also has the conundrums of a detective story, the emotional currents of a domestic drama and the quickening pulse of a psychological thriller, a combination that creates a kind of destabilization.

2016-10-21,The Renaissance Artifact Collections That Are Back in Style,"At the beginning of the Renaissance, in the 16th century, aristocrats and scholars began to fill rooms with exotic artifacts from far-flung territories — horns said to have belonged to unicorns, brilliant red coral, animal skeletons, chalices made of silver or coconut shells — often displayed among Old Master paintings and sculptures. Over time, the practice of collecting items for one’s “wunderkammer” (“cabinet of wonders”) became more and more elaborate. Kings would gift extraordinary objects to other rulers to impress them with their wealth, such as a windup automaton that poured wine or a boat carved of gold and set with hundreds of precious stones. Perhaps one of the world’s greatest collections, which still exists, is the Green Vault, the treasure chamber of August the Strong, which reopened to the public in Dresden in 2004 and contains thousands of objects, from a cherry stone carved with over a hundred faces to the largest green-hued diamond in the world.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/t-magazine/art/georg-laue-tefaf-wunderkammer.html

The same could be said of the director Park Chan-wook, whose attention to voluptuous detail — to opulent brocades and silky robes, luscious peaches and creamy shoulders — turns each scene into an invitation to ooh, aah and mmm. This is a movie that tries to ravish your senses so thoroughly you may not notice its sleights of hand.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/movies/the-handmaiden-review.html

This shallow but watchable gloss on a book that conjures a searing image of the disintegrating American dream in the 1960s, especially as it pertains to Jewish identity and aspiration, amounts to not much more than a dutiful checklist of scenes from the novel. And its elegiac tone omits Mr. Roth’s bitterly sarcastic humor.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/movies/american-pastoral-review-ewan-mcgregor.html

It’s Better.,"There is a type of documentary — one of the most prevalent varieties these days — that earnestly acquaints its audience with a terrible problem and rewards our attention with a gold star of virtue. You know the kind of film I mean. We are presented with a tableau of human misery or global catastrophe that has been put together with the vague but unarguably noble intention of “raising awareness,” as if such awareness were itself a kind of solution. The rules of the genre, at least as observed by American filmmakers, dictate an upbeat conclusion.

2016-10-21,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Ink: Before Bryan Cranston became a TV star, as the father on “Malcolm in the Middle” and especially as Walter White in “Breaking Bad,” he spent decades just trying to make a living as an actor, hustling for bit parts and homely commercial work. To judge from the genial, disarming tone of his memoir, “A Life in Parts” (new at No. 9 on the hardcover nonfiction list), that journeyman experience has given him the perspective to stay humble in the face of fame — or at least to maintain a sense of humor about it. “I’ve seen ‘Breaking Bad’ T-shirts in cities and little outposts all over the world,” he writes toward the end of the book. “People dress as Walter White for Halloween. They dress their children and dogs in hazmat suits and Heisenberg hats. People have shaved my face into the back of their heads, they’ve inked it on their backs, their forearms, their legs, their asses. I’m the permanent resident of some guy’s left butt cheek. Next to Larry and Moe. I suppose I’ve taken the place of Curly, the third Stooge. It’s a little . . . odd to have your face tattooed on someone’s backside. I did not see that coming when I lied about my ability to mountaineer in order to get a Mars bar commercial.” Fame has other pitfalls, too, Cranston adds. “As an actor you need to be sensitive, to be open, to be able to observe people and study human behavior,” he writes. “But as a celebrity I am no longer the observer, I am the observed. I am not the one who knocks. I am the one who ducks and covers.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

This armor takes a variety of forms. But one particular to the black community is code switching. We learn early and often that the way we are in spaces with other black people is not the way we should be in professional circles. So the clipped words, slang and biting humor we use with friends becomes smoothed out. We take on a style that our white peers find safe and nonthreatening. It isn’t lying, it’s a means of survival. But what happens when a black co-worker finds code switching to be dishonest and the language we use to define ourselves fails?",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/television/insecure-season-1-episode-3-recap.html

But his cravings soon overwhelmed him, and he resigned himself to cycling between jail and the streets.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/opinion/dont-lock-em-up-give-em-a-chance-to-quit-drugs.html

The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version — the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as “creator” or “innovator” — were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy’s anthem “Fight the Power” and Parliament’s “Flash Light” across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon.

Now, Upper West Side carnivores can have their pastured beef, air-chilled poultry and heritage pork, along with charcuterie like head cheese, from the new meat market and restaurant that Ken Friedman and the chef April Bloomfield have bestowed on the neighborhood. About half the no-frills corner space is an open kitchen with display cases for the work of Erika Nakamura and Jocelyn Guest, the butchers. Items like rotisserie chicken can be brought home for dinner, but those tempted by a slab of pork terrine or a hot dog on the spot can perch at a counter and even accompany it with beer, wine or kombucha from a tap. Tufted black leather banquettes, tables and chairs furnish the restaurant portion, with counter service at breakfast and lunch, and waiters at dinner with a menu of items like lettuce wrap with crispy pork, hacked chicken with green sauce, smoked lamb ribs, and rice with drippings.

2016-10-26,The Latest and Best in Horror,"“Suddenly it all struck Misao as impossibly artificial.” This epiphany comes to a middle-class Tokyo woman about halfway through Mariko Koike’s unnerving novel THE GRAVEYARD APARTMENT (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin’s, $25.99), after a scant three months of living in the title residence: a roomy eighth-floor flat that overlooks a temple, a burial ground and a crematory. (No wonder the price was so reasonable.) What seems to her artificial isn’t the strange things that have been happening in the building — the sudden death of a pet bird, a mysterious cold wind in the basement, an elevator that stops working at the most inconvenient times — but the day-to-day life she lives with her husband, her small daughter and her dog, which goes on as if nothing were happening at all. “Everything Teppei and I do these days — no, really, everything the four of us do, including Tamao and even Cookie — somehow feels as if we’re all acting in a play, she thought. A theater-of-the-absurd play about the daily routine of an utterly ordinary family living in a beautiful, sunny apartment, without a care or worry in the world. Just an average family, living in a perfectly normal building, playing their parts to the hilt. Except that something isn’t quite right about this idyllic tableau. . . .”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/books/review/graveyard-apartment-and-more-horror.html

2016-10-26,The Festival of Praise Tour Arrives in Brooklyn,"This year’s installment of the annual Festival of Praise Tour, at Kings Theater in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Nov. 2, is strong on 1990s and early 2000s heavy hitters: Fred Hammond, with his buttery, tender voice; the off-the-cuff powerhouse Karen Clark Sheard; the versatile worship leader Israel Houghton. These are stars of gospel’s maximalist period and occasional flirters with its pop-soul instincts. But the lineup offers a couple of surprises at the margins, too: Regina Belle, a soul star of the 1980s and ’90s who has turned to gospel over the last decade; and the youngest singer on the bill, the up-and-comer Casey J, whose appealing take on gospel is more sonically modest and internally complicated than the lions she joins on this tour.

2016-10-26,"At the Classical New York Festival of Song, Music for Deciding a Vote","What does it mean to be American? As the election season lurches into its final stretch, the New York Festival of Song offers a chance to reflect on the question through music, and from different vantage points. On Tuesday, Nov. 1, and Thursday at Merkin Concert Hall, this cherished institution presents “Rodgers, Rodgers & Guettel: A Century of American Musical Theater,” a program that takes the temperature of the American dream as expressed in the songs by Richard Rodgers, his daughter Mary Rodgers (“Once Upon a Mattress”) and his grandson Adam Guettel (known for the score to “The Light in the Piazza”). The vibrant lineup includes the soprano Lauren Worsham, the mezzo-soprano Mary Testa and the baritone John Brancy. On Wednesday at National Sawdust, the organization’s new-music arm invites the Peruvian-American composer Gabriela Lena Frank to design an evening around her own folk-and-mythology-inspired compositions as well as works by the composers Avner Dorman and Derek Bermel. Performers include the soprano Amy Owens; the Momenta Quartet; and the festival’s associate artistic director, Michael Barrett, at the piano.

But she hasn’t been away for long. Ever since she blazed onto Broadway with a Tony-winning, show-stealing performance in a revival of “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown” in 1999 (she officially made her Broadway debut two years earlier, in “Steel Pier”), Ms. Chenoweth has returned regularly, in revivals of “Promises, Promises” and “On the Twentieth Century,” but perhaps most memorably as the perkier witch in the long-running “Wicked,” chirping merrily about her popularity.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/theater/kristin-chenoweths-many-lullabies-for-broadway.html
2016-10-26,‘Demagogues’ Presents Political Kings and Kingmakers,"Cast a vote for insight at Film Forum, where the programmer Bruce Goldstein has lined up masterworks timed to the election. “Demagogues” (Nov. 4 to Nov. 11) offers the obvious like “Citizen Kane” and “All the King’s Men” and curiosities like Gregory La Cava’s “Gabriel Over the White House,” from 1933, with Walter Huston as a president who becomes a benevolent dictator after a car crash. Most devastating is Elia Kazan’s “A Face in the Crowd” (1957), which reunited Kazan and his “On the Waterfront” screenwriter, Budd Schulberg. Lonesome Rhodes, a charismatic Southern singing jailbird (Andy Griffith, surpassing his television roles), is groomed into a TV star by a reporter (Patricia Neal), eventually becoming a political kingmaker felled by his libido, raging hypocrisy and hollow populism. A mentor warns him about “the way you begin to shoot suddenly out of control,” but the seeds of Rhodes’s undoing appear the moment the reporter first asks him to sing. “Wait a minute,” he says. “What do I get out of this?” (filmforum.org)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/movies/demagogues-presents-political-kings-and-kingmakers.html

In Ms. Minter’s paintings, based on exuberantly composed photographs, fashion tropes appear as if hauled under a truth-telling microscope, where hairs and pimples and dirt hold equal sway with makeup and bling. Her interest in pornography, and what Holland Cotter in The New York Times called a “pathology of glamour,” made for tough going in the 1990s, when she was criticized by some feminists as a sexualizer for its own sake. But at 68, she is seeing history come around to her way of thinking.

India Beat, owned by Bertie and Victoria Dyer, a husband-and-wife team of trip-planners, facilitates half-day workshops in hand-block-printing in Bagru, a village outside Jaipur. The couple works with a single family of artisans who have been practicing their craft for generations and who help guests choose a design (whether traditional or newfangled) and color scheme (brick reds and deep indigos are popular picks). After practicing on a cotton prototype, the printmakers-in-training stamp their final designs onto a piece of cotton-silk cloth using custom-carved wooden blocks. The hope is that, in addition to a unique souvenir, people leave with a deeper connection to the country’s material culture. For all its glorious chaos, Victoria says, “India remains a place where intimate moments are still the most special.” From $175.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/t-magazine/fashion/india-beat-hand-block-printing-bertie-victoria-dyer.html

There’s a touch of luxury outdoors — a small vineyard near the bank of the river — but it’s buffered by di Suvero’s brutal workroom, which functions as a kind of graveyard of unfinished sculptures, scattered among forklifts and laser cutters.

Put the saddle between your legs and, with the pedal for your dominant foot at the 9 o’clock position, step up onto the unicycle as if you were climbing stairs; as the unicycle moves underneath you, put the other foot on its pedal. Hold onto a wall or a fence for support.

The refurbishment of the director’s reputation, which began in 1966 when François Truffaut published his landmark book of interviews, “Hitchcock/Truffaut,” reached its conclusion in 2012 when the film critics polled by Sight and Sound voted “Vertigo” the greatest film of all time, kicking Orson Welles’s “Citizen Kane” from a top spot it had enjoyed for decades. Wellesians bit their knuckles, and the rest of us scratched our heads. “Vertigo” is not Hitchcock’s best, but rather, with its lush morbidity, somnolent pace, poor box office and relative scarcity of jokes, the Hitchcock film for those who most wish he were French. Flops make film critics feel useful — they are the film-crit equivalent of the deserving poor.

2016-10-28,Regional Japanese Fare Comes to America,"In the States, we’ve tended to think of Japanese food as a single cuisine that includes raw fish, teriyaki, tempura and ramen. In Japan, as elsewhere, there are hyperlocal specialties: fried chicken in Nagoya, grilled oysters from Miyajima, tangerines and green tea in Shizuoka. Now, a crop of new restaurants is finally introducing some of this regional nuance to American diners. Ichiran, which opened last month in Brooklyn, has only one thing on the menu: tonkotsu ramen served Fukuoka-style, with straight, thin noodles and a rich pork-bone broth. TsuruTonTan in Manhattan specializes in udon from the Kansai region, served hot in a fish-based dashi or twisted over a bed of ice with a soy dipping sauce. Over in L.A., Shibumi offers kappo, a tradition in which the chef presents seasonal small plates — like Nagano-inspired fresh soba noodles in November — to diners at the counter.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/t-magazine/food/regional-japanese-cuisine-restaurants-ichiran-shibumi.html

2016-10-31,Hunting Pigeon in the Pyrenees — for Supper,"FALL IS WILD GAME SEASON in France, and discerning diners at Parisian outposts like L’Ami Jean, La Régalade and Spring come especially for the composed dishes of just-hunted, rich-tasting game. That one might bite into one’s mallard or grouse and land on stray birdshot is perhaps a badge of honor, proof that what’s on your plate has a woodsier back story than the steak. And palombe, or wood pigeon, has a better back story than most. “As a chef, you want something that tastes delicious, but also that’s coherent and has its own tradition,” says Daniel Rose, who serves it rare-roasted at his First Arrondissement restaurant Spring during the bird’s month-and-a-half season from mid-October to the end of November. Generally grayer than its close cousin, the standard pigeon, with distinctive white marks on its neck and wings, the wild-caught palombe is more delicately gamy and less rich. Rose serves his with braised foie gras and cabbage, and a purée of smoked beet. At L’Ami Jean, Stéphane Jégo goes a more traditional route, roasting the birds with thyme and garlic, or stewed in salmi, a mixture of giblets, wine and foie gras. “Wild palombe brings a rustic, old-fashioned moment to the table,” Rose notes. “It evokes the deliciousness of nature and cooking on an open fire.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/t-magazine/food/palombe-pigeon-basque-country.html

In “The Kingdom of Speech,” Tom Wolfe pairs Dr. Chomsky (“Noam Charisma”) with Darwin as the malign Ur-theorists of evolution.
