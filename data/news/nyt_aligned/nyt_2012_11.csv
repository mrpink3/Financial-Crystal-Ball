Mr. Ai has described his 81-day detention and the subsequent fine of $2.4 million as a desperate attempt by the government to silence him. Mr. Ai has always said he considered the donations to be loans, but decided to begin repayment after losing a final appeal of the tax case last month, he said Thursday. “We are really thankful for what people did, which is remarkable in today’s China,” he said by phone. “It’s one thing to have sympathy for our cause, but it’s another to act and send money.”",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/world/asia/chinese-artist-ai-weiwei-to-repay-donations.html

Manchester, who died in 2004, will not be among those eagerly awaiting its reception. The man with the most at stake is the co-author of record, and in fact the actual author: Paul Reid, who had never written a book before and whose specialty before he met Manchester was features for The Palm Beach Post. The story of how Reid, 63, was plucked from anonymity and thrust into the spotlight is not a simple understudy-replaces-star saga, and it’s safe to say that Reid could not have imagined what a mixed blessing he would experience after accepting Manchester’s invitation to co-write the third volume of Churchill’s biography.

Maybe that explains why this Politico story on the Romney transition effort seemed to come and go last week with hardly any comment. Obviously the various on-background quotes need to be taken with a grain of salt (not least because the most important players in Romney’s inner circle are still absorbed with the campaign), but this seemed like a striking passage:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/if-romney-wins/

For a start, take a lesson from Justin Patterson and Anna Burke. By day Burke is a designer at Kemble Interiors and Patterson runs an investment partnership. By night they are perfecting the art of hosting the foolproof vegan/carnivore dinner party for their picky-eater friends and family at their house on the Hudson River in Palisades, N.Y. Patterson is intimately acquainted with both herbivorous eating and excellent meat: he grew up in Virginia in a family of vegetarians — who happen to run a heritage grass-fed-cattle farm. These days, Patterson, who started eating meat at the age of 21, enjoys the yield of the family business (though he avoids gluten). He and Burke, who eats everything and loves to cook, are avid entertainers. They’re passionate about high-quality ingredients (just listen to them wax rhapsodic about Le Saunier de Camargue Fleur de Sel or the merits of cooking with high-smoke-point fats, like ghee or macadamia nut oil) and meticulous about style and presentation. And rather than balk at preparing a menu that has to do double duty, they’ve figured out the formula for making it a breeze.

2012-11-02,China: Cafe Owner Sentenced Over Online Messages," The owner of an Internet cafe in southwest China was given an eight-year prison term for criticizing the ruling Communists in online messages and for seeking to establish an opposition party, his wife said Thursday. The man, Cao Haibo, 27, of Kunming in Yunnan Province, was accused of “subversion of state power” for trying to set up the “China Republican Party” — an entity that existed on paper, and only for one day.

Renee Xia, international director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group in Washington, criticized the prosecution of Mr. Cao. “Cao’s only ‘crime’ was to chat in an online group, where members discussed such ideas as democratic reform and constitutional rights,” Ms. Xia said. “This case is a travesty of justice.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/world/asia/china-cafe-owner-sentenced-over-online-messages.html

2012-11-02,What’s on Friday,"8:20 P.M. (Cinemax) THIS MEANS WAR (2012) Two C.I.A. officers, Tuck (Tom Hardy) and F D R (Chris Pine), find their friendship — and their mission to prevent an international criminal (Til Schweiger) from obtaining a weapon of mass destruction — disrupted by Lauren (Reese Witherspoon, above, with Mr. Pine, left, and Mr. Hardy), a product-testing executive they’re both dating. This romantic comedy was directed by McG from a script by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg. “The clever hook in ‘Mr. and Mrs. Smith,’ which Mr. Kinberg also wrote, is that its mister and missus are covert assassins (neither knows what the other does), whose marriage blahs vanish once they turn their gun sights on each other,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while the filmmakers try a variation on that theme here, Lauren is a “weak sister” to Angelina Jolie’s Mrs. Smith. “It doesn’t help that the men’s rivalry soon escalates into spy versus spy shenanigans,” Ms. Dargis added. “And while it’s initially amusing to see them snoop on Lauren, by the time each has planted surveillance bugs in her house, you’re watching a cuddly stalker flick.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

The new series, called “Hello Ladies,” will star Mr. Merchant as a character named Stephen, described by HBO in an e-mail as “a gawky Englishman searching for the woman of his dreams in Los Angeles.” The network said it has ordered eight episodes of the series, for which Mr. Merchant directed the pilot, and which he wrote with Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (whose credits include NBC’s American version of “The Office” and films like “Bad Teacher”). The unlucky love life of Mr. Merchant, who has also been featured in comedy films like “Hall Pass,” tends to be a recurring theme of his humor; as he recently wrote on his Twitter account: “Attitude from Siri when I cancelled writing a text.

2012-11-02,Assessing Africa,"Among the Africans who deserve some kind of secular sainthood is Wole So­yinka. Although best known as a playwright, he has also written poetry, novels and nonfiction; the luminous world evoked in his memoir “Aké: The Years of Childhood” sticks with me decades after I read it. Moreover, Soyinka has always been a passionate defender of human rights. For trying to negotiate peace during the Nigerian civil war of the late 1960s, he spent two years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement; some 30 years later, as an opponent of a later generation of military dictatorship, he had to escape Nigeria on a motorcycle and was sentenced to death in absentia.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/of-africa-by-wole-soyinka.html

2012-11-02,Known Unknowns,"Nate Silver has lived a preposterously interesting life. In 2002, while toiling away as a lowly consultant for the accounting firm KPMG, he hatched a revolutionary method for predicting the performance of baseball players, which the Web site Baseball Prospectus subsequently acquired. The following year, he took up poker in his spare time and quit his job after winning $15,000 in six months. (His annual poker winnings soon ran into the six-figures.) Then, in early 2008, Silver noticed that most political prognostication was bunk. Silver promptly reinvented that field, too.

For one day this man-child will find himself interested in something that doesn’t involve Tim Tebow, and when that day comes, the reviewer will cease being so bitter that every bloody parent she meets at that bloody school (note: cheapskate newspaper won’t let her curse), a school where other children speak Mandarin for fun, has an advanced degree in physics or computer science, something real and important and not some rinky-dink literature degree like hers.

Cutting tax rates at the top appears “to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie,” the report said. “However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.” So charging the rich lower tax rates doesn’t promote economic growth; it merely increases economic inequality.",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/ideology-over-reality/

Children are resilient; they find fun in unexpected places.

2012-11-02,Degrees of Infidelity to Tolstoy’s Heroine,"IT isn’t easy to be faithful. Anna Karenina, for example, the title heroine of the magisterial 1877 novel by Leo Tolstoy, thinks herself happy enough with her distinguished husband, her sweet-tempered young son and her impeccable standing in the highest levels of St. Petersburg society, until she meets a dashing cavalry officer and gives it all up for him. Her infidelity is not casual or discreet, as it is for other respectable women in her set, but helpless, urgent, terrifyingly intense; she doesn’t know what hit her. The infidelity of the many filmmakers who have tried to tell Anna’s story on the screen is not, generally, of that kind. A novel of the length (over 900 pages) and complexity of “Anna Karenina” and a feature film of, say, two hours’ duration do not make an ideal match; dissatisfaction is inevitable, outright betrayal highly likely.

But in a twist of fate, it will also be the first New York City Marathon televised live nationally, so the country will have a front-row seat for the race, which is being run despite much opposition and with the sentiment among many New Yorkers that this is an insane use of city resources in the middle of a disaster.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/sports/no-back-seat-for-sports-leading-off.html

The Department of Education has typically tracked borrowers who default on federal loans within two years of entering their repayment period. The window has just been extended to three years, with the hope of getting a better picture of how many are in distress. An average 13.4 percent of borrowers who entered repayment in fiscal year 2009 defaulted within three years; 47 percent of them attended for-profit colleges and universities. The accompanying charts show the colleges and universities with highest and lowest three-year default rates (only institutions offering graduate degrees and with at least 500 borrowers entering repayment were considered).",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/where-theyre-defaulting.html

He raised $1.4 million in the fall of 2011 to pay a bond to the government that would allow him to contest the tax charge. A Beijing court rejected his lawsuit against the tax authorities this year, and in July another court rejected an appeal. Mr. Ai said that he expected the government to keep the bond money, but that he would repay the donors. He said Friday that he still needed to repay more than $1 million.

It’s for the good of his children, he rationalizes in this adaptation of the British journalist Benjamin Mee’s nonfiction book of the same title, directed by Cameron Crowe. “The creaks, groans and clichés of the screenplay, which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (“27 Dresses”) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are, however, finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Crowe doesn’t linger over Benjamin’s despondency.” Rather, she added, “he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that there’s often a strain of melancholia in this director’s work, a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it. Whatever the case, you may not buy his happy endings, but it’s a seductive ideal when all of God’s creatures, great and small, buxom and blond, exist in such harmony.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

This week, a judge had ordered the Arizona group, known as Americans for Responsible Leadership, to submit to an audit by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, the state’s political watchdog. Americans for Responsible Leadership appealed the ruling, however, which automatically stayed the audit. The Fair Political Practices Commission asked an appeals court to lift the stay, but the court denied the request. Ann Ravel, the chairwoman of the commission, said her agency planned to ask the State Supreme Court to lift the stay, but acknowledged that voters would probably cast ballots on Tuesday without knowing who financed the Arizona group’s donation. “The voters are the losers in this,” she said.

2012-11-05,Back to the Future,"The trend of turning historic buildings into heritage-steeped hotels goes into overdrive this season, led by the Café Royal, the 19th-century Regency building near London’s Piccadilly Circus, where Edward VIII drank, Oscar Wilde hallucinated and all manner of rockers have cut loose. The architect David Chipperfield has incorporated that original structure — most recently a grotty banquet hall — into his design for a serenely modern new hotel (doubles from about $726), opening next month. The gilded accents and cartouche-lined canopies in the Café Royal’s legendary Grill and Domino rooms have been painstakingly restored to their 1920s heyday. For a more eccentric take on past glory, check out the new QT Sydney hotel (doubles from $436), located inside Sydney’s 1920s State Theatre (notable for its Art Deco-style gargoyles). The building’s dramatic past is recalled through quirky décor — bowler-hat light shades, stagy curtains, even an original 1930s urinal — and a thespy staff who had to pass “Idol”-style auditions before being “cast.” The revival tour continues at the 123-year-old resort Hotel Jerome (doubles from $595) in Aspen, Colo., which will emerge next month from a top-to-bottom renovation that restores Western soul to a property that’s been somewhat lost ever since a froufrou 1980s-era redesign. It’s easy to imagine the onetime guest Hunter S.

2012-11-05,Prediction Time: Obama Survives,"As of this writing, my colleague Nate Silver’s election forecast has President Obama’s odds of re-election at 86 percent. The details of his famous forecasting method may be proprietary, but the argument, at this point, is straightforward: The President leads Mitt Romney by a small but solid margin in the state-level polling; that lead has been robust for weeks; state polling has historically been somewhat more accurate and currently provides a richer data set than the national polls where Romney’s numbers are slightly better; and the tight national polling could be consistent with an Obama electoral college win in any case. To pull the election out, Romney needs to win several states where the polls show him basically tied with the president (or even slightly behind, in some of the latest Virginia polling) and then win a state or two from a list (Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, longer shots like Pennsylvania) where the polling has never really shown him doing anything but trailing.

2012-11-06,Iran: Canadian Ruling Assailed," Relations between Iran and Canada, already at a low point after Canada severed diplomatic ties in September, worsened Monday as Iran denounced a Canadian court ruling that froze Iranian government assets in Canada. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Iran held Canada’s government responsible for the court order, issued last week, which applied to Iran’s embassy in Ottawa, two former cultural centers and a diplomatic residence. Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mr. Mehmanparast as saying “the political motivations behind such a move are not hidden to anybody.” The Ontario Superior Court of Justice temporarily froze the assets in response to a request filed by the family of an American, Marla Bennett, who was killed in a Jerusalem bombing 11 years ago that was said to be the work of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group supported by Iran. The Bennett family won a default judgment against Iran for $12.9 million in an American court but was unable to collect; they are now trying to enforce it with Iranian assets in Canada. It is unclear whether the court will allow the family to seize the properties. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/world/middleeast/iran-canadian-ruling-assailed.html

2012-11-07,See It Now | George Nelson at Yale,"The exhibition “George Nelson: Architect, Writer, Designer, Teacher” opens on Thursday at the Yale School of Architecture Gallery, its final stop on a four-year international tour, where it will be on view until Jan. 26, 2013. The exhibition, which was organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, includes more than 120 examples of furniture designs for home and office as well as over 50 drawings, models, photographs, films and other materials, and is the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to Nelson (1908-1986), one of the best-known American designers of the postwar era. Although he’s most famous for eye-catching designs like the Marshmallow Sofa, the Coconut Chair and the Ball Clock, Nelson — who was trained as an architect at Yale and was an influential editor at Architectural Forum magazine in the 1930s and ’40s — was most passionate about design’s role in the way people lived and worked. His 1945 book, “Tomorrow’s Houses” (with Henry Wright), espoused the family room and the storage wall; the latter, which was produced by Herman Miller, where Nelson was the director of design from 1945 to 1972, was one of his lasting contributions to the field. (He designed an L-shaped desk for Herman Miller that was a forerunner of the office workstation.) Among many other projects in his productive career, Nelson also did corporate image design for clients like General Electric and I.B.M.; he was the head designer for the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959; and he came up with a 64-foot-long car and a walk-in engine for Chrysler’s pavilion at the 1964 New York World’s Fair.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/see-it-now-george-nelson-at-yale/

2012-11-08,A Basketball Fairy Tale in Middle America,"N.B.A. scoring champions are, as a rule, weirdos and reprobates and in some cases diagnosable sociopaths. Something about dominating your opponent, publicly, more or less every day of your life, in the most visible aspect of your sport, tends to either warp your spirit or to be possible only to those whose spirits are already warped. Michael Jordan, when he wasn’t busy scoring, was busy punching a teammate in the face and gambling away small fortunes. Allen Iverson, in his spare time, recorded an aesthetically and morally terrible rap album and gave an iconic speech denigrating the very notion of practice. Kobe Bryant is and shall forever be Kobe Bryant. Wilt, Shaq, Pistol Pete, Dominique, McGrady, McAdoo, Rick Barry — it’s a near-solid roster of dysfunction: sadists, narcissists, malcontents, knuckleheads, misanthropes, womanizers, addicts and villains. While it’s true that plain old N.B.A. superstars do occasionally manage to be model citizens (cf.

In it, Elinor Brooke, a young artist studying under the professor Henry Tonks, tries to learn the fate of her brother Toby, a medical officer who is missing and presumed dead. In The New York Times Book Review, John Vernon wrote of Ms. Barker’s novels about the war: “Like most good works of fiction, they’re not so much about the events they depict as about the resonance of those events, the way certain actions ripple through people’s lives.” In a recent e-mail interview, Ms. Barker discussed her use of historical figures in fiction, thinking about war from a feminine perspective and more.

The best place to feel the city’s true pulse, though, is in the other Cancún: downtown, in the tangle of mostly tourist-free squares, market stalls and shiny new developments offering their own destination-worthy nightspots, shops and restaurants.

At long last, that wish has come true: The pair has just introduced a trio of candles in their most popular fragrances. Lady has an herbal, citrusy bouquet with notes of amber, lavender and bergamot; No. 247 is a gentle blend of bergamot, thyme, lavender, musk and ylang ylang; and Cedar’s woodsy notes of cedar and sandalwood are balanced out by orange and rose.

A bur, of course, can clamp onto wool socks with surprising force, and — even more amazing — once you pry it off, it can stick again and again, like glue that never wears out.

Since the advent of James Frey, at least, it has been the habit not only to greet a memoir with a torrent of legal inquiries but also to doubt the very accuracy of the voice telling us the story. Eric Nuzum’s “Giving Up the Ghost,” which is much concerned with the supernatural, is no exception. Nuzum’s account raises a clutch of questions about realism and memory. Because of this, I confess, and because I am schooled in memoirs involving psychiatric hospitals, I almost immediately began trying to come up with a diagnosis for the apparent unreliability of this narrator: borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar type II, addictive personality disorder, mixed anxiety-­depressive disorder and so on. Like sufferers of all these illnesses, Nuzum seems by turns lovable, charismatic, exhausting, irritating, self-destructive, impossible and sometimes plain dumb. And yet, by the end of the book, it’s hard to overlook just how effectively he has described the emotional lives of the American young.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/giving-up-the-ghost-by-eric-nuzum.html

Or again: “Gonna visit Edgar. My old buddy Edgar.” These seemingly obscure allusions to the author of “The Raven” are explained as the plot — in more than one sense — unfolds in “The Secret Race,” Hamilton’s confessional memoir, written with Daniel Coyle. With its faults, the book is riveting enough, although today, some weeks after its publication, it reads like a trailer to the 200-page report from the United States Anti-Doping Agency released last month. This devastating indictment of the worst doping scandal — and the greatest conspiracy — yet seen in competitive sport led to the decision by the International Cycling Union, the cycling governing body, to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles and bar him from the sport for life.

Later, one of his novels, “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” became a critical and commercial hit, as well as a 2010 movie starring Zach Galifianakis. Vizzini was then, and continues to be now, in full possession of a clever, seductively deadpan voice, as the first few sentences of his new young adult novel, “The Other Normals,” bear out: “This is a story about becoming a man, so naturally it starts with me alone in a room playing with myself. Not that way — playing Creatures & Caverns, the popular role-playing game. Popular being a relative term. I guess if Creatures & Caverns were really popular, I would have other people to play with.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/the-other-normals-by-ned-vizzini.html
2012-11-09,Whose Body Is It Anyway?,"One of the many pleasures of reading dystopian novels is encountering a different but recognizable world, and then uncovering clues to how things ended up this way and relishing the sense of discovery. Two new dystopian novels not only explore such alternative realms and the societies that populate them, but also probe the smaller worlds of human bodies and the souls that inhabit them. Both Rachel Cohn’s “Beta” and Kat Zhang’s “What’s Left of Me” offer meticulously crafted settings and unusual characters while posing fascinating questions about the nature of body and soul.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/beta-and-whats-left-of-me.html
2012-11-09,Tastes of Victory,"European children’s books have a lot in common with the TV shows we Americans import from the British: either rarefied and arty (“Downton Abbey”) or full of poop jokes and low humor (um, “Benny Hill”). These three picture books from abroad offer a little bit of both the high and low ends of the artistic spectrum.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/valentine-and-his-violin-and-more.html
2012-11-09,Tech Trouble,"Books with plots that center on technology are rarely about that technology; rather, they are about the impact of that technology. In two new young adult novels, “Crewel” and “Eve & Adam,” we face two potentially alarming worlds: one in which technology has fundamentally altered the human body, and in the other, where it’s changed the very fabric of reality. And it’s up to a couple of teenage heroines to deal with it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/crewel-and-eve-adam.html
2012-11-09,Histories of War,"Earlier this year, a British publisher told me something that made me especially proud to write nonfiction. Nowhere else in the world, he said, is nonfiction for young people written as it is in the United States, where authors often select their own subjects rather than have them handed down by a publisher; find their own images rather than farm the job out to a photo researcher; and work closely with designers to lay out each page. He is right: American nonfiction for children and teenage readers is often a labor of love. Two new books about war, Steve Sheinkin’s “Bomb” and Doreen Rappaport’s “Beyond Courage,” offer particular excellence — vivid writing and original research inspired by personal passion — in a field that all too often ­is invisible.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/bomb-and-beyond-courage.html

2012-11-09,Somebody to Care,"How can life be so painful yet so beautiful? How can we make sense of what we feel?

They’re also the stuff undergraduate English lit classes are made of. Whatever our age, parental death, abandonment and neglect immediately tug at our sympathies, showing us the fearsome realities of the adult world, rendered starker when seen through a child’s eyes.

Katherine Marsh’s “Jepp, Who ­Defied the Stars” delves into these perennial adolescent challenges while transporting her readers to a tiny island in Denmark in the late 16th century — and without the help of either time machine or wizard. Instead Marsh turns to one of history’s ­real-life magicians, the brilliant, eccentric astronomer Tycho Brahe, to welcome her readers to his castle-cum-­observatory, Uraniborg.

2012-11-09,Stealing the Sunlight,"In most children’s books, from “Little Bear” to “The Jungle Book,” nature exists as a kind of utopia, a lush playground with anthropomorphized animals. It’s rare to find stories that realistically depict the natural world — as a beautiful but fragile realm under siege. Is it because Dr. Seuss so brilliantly impugned the human race’s ecological crimes in “The Lorax” that another masterpiece in the genre has seemed beyond reach? Because our children are so screen-­addicted and nature-starved, we fear ­further exiling them from the outdoors with tales of environmental peril? Or maybe it’s because such stories would expose any grown-up who travels by aircraft or uses Ziploc baggies as an environmental offender. Whatever the reason, eco-lit needs more attention, and devotees will be pleased to discover a new addition from the Icelandic author Andri Snaer Magnason, who writes with a Seussian mix of wonder, wit and gravitas.

Hardly known in Germany, according to the organizers of the show, the Impressionist painter was a strong financial supporter of other Impressionists — Renoir and Monet — paying for their studios and acquiring their works.

Told in the form of a blog-within-a-blog, written by the eponymous physician in a blurred state of somnambulant arousal (the doctor types notes on his iPad during sex), the book gained a small but zealous following among fans of droll divertissements.

Its owners, Jenny Park and Mickey Petralia, serve Stumptown coffee, savory and sweet pies, avocado sandwiches, chili, scones, cookies and quiches, as well as their ‘‘Snakedog,’’ a pastry-wrapped hot dog. ‘‘I like a rustic, homemade style as opposed to fine-dining type of food,’’ says Park, who is also the pastry chef. The fare fits the surroundings, a rugged network of trails that vein the Santa Monica mountains above Los Feliz. ‘‘People come to escape,’’ she says. ‘‘It’s an oasis away from the main city.

Proenza Schouler fans might also notice material from the designers’ past collections upholstered onto Melgaard’s hulking, off-kilter furniture and patchworked into a rug on the gallery’s ground floor. “This kind of collaboration is a lot of fun and gives us freedom to play a little outside of our usual system,” said McCollough and Hernandez in an e-mail. “Bjarne is an incredible artist and we are very much honored both to know him and to be a part of his wild ride.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/graphic-material-a-proenza-schoulerbjarne-melgaard-mash-up/

(DirecTV) THE ROLLING STONES: CHARLIE IS MY DARLING — IRELAND 1965 (2012) In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Rolling Stones, this hourlong documentary — originally directed by Peter Whitehead and produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, and digitally restored for a new version by the director Mick Gochanour and the producer Robin Klein — follows the young band, with Brian Jones on guitar (above left, with Mick Jagger), as it tours Ireland in 1965. “It is both a postcard from an earlier phase of celebrity culture and a glorious mixtape of raucous and memorable songs,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times — among them, “The Last Time,” “Time Is on My Side,” “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” and “a couple of Beatles tunes hummed and strummed by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger in a hotel room” as the men “were still figuring out how to be the opposite of the four lads from Liverpool.” Their answer, he added, “was to be naughtier, more aggressive, more theatrically sexual.” And despite intimations of events to come — Jones’s death, less than five years away, and the lethal mayhem of Altamont in 1969 — mostly, Mr. Scott said, “what you see is the intensity of rock ’n’ roll at a time when it still felt risky and thrilling.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2012-11-12,What to Listen to When Sipping a November Drink,"Like drinking, music is seasonal, I think. And as I explain in my November Drink column, late autumn is definitely folk-music prime time for me. Cider seems to go down better to a soundtrack of eerie ballads and tragic old love songs, many of them dating back hundreds of years. I favor British folk and folk-rock artists like Shirley Collins, Ewan MacColl and Martin Carthy — and above all Sandy Denny, who died in 1978 at 31. (By then she’d made her mark with the legendary folk-rock outfit Fairport Convention, but she might forever be best known for her ethereal vocals on Led Zeppelin’s “Battle of Evermore.”) Her voice, at once primal and refined, is like a solitary walk through the woods in late autumn. As for younger British musicians, I’m smitten with the Unthanks, a Northumbrian band fronted by the sisters Rachel and Becky Unthank, whose rich, haunting harmonies are just right. But I can’t resist some of the greatest traditional American singers either — especially Jean Ritchie and Ralph Stanley.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/what-to-listen-to-when-sipping-a-november-drink/

The parents, Marc and Debra Tice, who traveled from Houston to Beirut, Lebanon, said at a news conference that they would travel to Syria if necessary to be reunited with their son. The missing journalist, a former Marine whose articles on the Syria conflict and the insurgent Free Syrian Army have been published by several news organizations, was last heard from on Aug. 13. A video that showed a person said to be Mr. Tice, apparently in the custody of Islamist militants in Syria, surfaced on Oct. 1, but its authenticity was never confirmed. American officials initially said they believed that Syria’s government had detained Mr. Tice, who entered Syria without official permission. Last week, a State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said she had been urging the Syrian government “to be more forthcoming” with any information it might have about Mr. Tice.

2012-11-13,Britain: Radical Cleric Wins Deportation Appeal," An immigration appeals tribunal ruled Monday that sending a militant Islamic preacher known as Abu Qatada to Jordan to face terrorism charges would violate his right to a fair trial under European human rights law. Judge John Mitting ordered Abu Qatada, 52, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, to be released from prison on Tuesday under tight bail conditions. The ruling was a blow to the British government, which wants to rid the country of foreign-born radical clerics it says are fomenting Islamic militancy. British security officials say Mr. Othman was one of Al Qaeda’s top operatives in Europe. Previous attempts to deport him were blocked by the European Court of Human Rights over concerns that evidence obtained from others under torture might be used against him in Jordan. The preacher, who is of Palestinian descent, was convicted in absentia of involvement in two bombing plots in Jordan in 1999 and 2000, and faces a retrial if returned home. Home Secretary Theresa May said the government would appeal Monday’s ruling. “Qatada is a dangerous man,” she said. “The government has been doing everything it can to get rid of Abu Qatada, and we will continue to do so.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/world/europe/britain-radical-cleric-wins-deportation-appeal.html

But in the rest of the United States people who want to die must rely on friends, family and underground organizations. “Frontline” explores the world of assisted suicide, where the line between legality and criminal behavior blurs in cases like those of Hunt Williams, who was charged with manslaughter for helping a friend shoot himself, and Joan Butterstein (above left, with her daughter Kathleen), a lung cancer patient who turned to Compassion & Choices, a nonprofit counseling and referral organization on end-of-life care, for advice on obtaining a lethal combination of medications that she could administer herself. This episode of “Frontline” also shows a training session for the Final Exit Network, one of the country’s most controversial right-to-die organizations. “When you’re dealing with areas this complex, you’re so much better off with an open system than a secret system,” says Dr. Timothy Quill, a palliative-care physician and leading right-to-die advocate.

After the Nov. 16 deadline, they will send the tweets to their studio near Shanghai, where their production team will chose a collection’s worth and make clothes from them. “It’s a project that’s really speaking to what we want to do with the residency, which is connect consumers, designers and manufacturers,” Finkelstein explains. “We’re going to stay out of it in terms of deciding what’s going to get produced. It will be up to us to figure out how to fit everything together and display it as a collection.” The tweets so far have ranged from the prosaic to the poetic. “He kept the corners of his eyes for her grey ghost silhouette,” reads one; another requests “a bustle made of swarming crowds searching for popsicles and a duster coat spun of nightmares.” “We’ve done so many strange projects that our studio is used to it,” Finkelstein says of the unorthodox directives. “Anyway, we’ve been doing a bunch of sweatshirts, so I think they’re looking forward to working on something more interesting.” The collection will be on display at the Museum of Art and Design beginning on Jan. 8.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/tweet-couture-jf-son-at-the-museum-of-arts-and-design/

Dougherty, a Delaware native, has also decorated a Brooklyn high school for a Drake rap video directed by Kanye West and a dive-bar-themed wedding reception in Red Hook (with the design company Silkstone). For this shot, Dougherty created a photo booth in Paris, a project she sets up for events around the world.

The collapse of the deal was first reported by The Arizona Republic. The City Council is expected to vote on Dec. 5 to give the house landmark status, which would shield it from alterations and demolition for three years. The home’s owners, Steve Sells and John Hoffman, have said the restrictions would “significantly diminish” their ability to market the property, which is priced at $2.379 million. They said they did not find out about the effort to turn the house into a historic landmark until after they had closed on its purchase.

Failed in Sri Lanka," An internal review of how the United Nations handled the bloody final months of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 2009, when as many as 40,000 civilians were killed, has concluded that the response was “a grave failure of the U.N.,” according to a leaked draft report. The panel, led by Charles Petrie, a former U.N. official, criticized what it called “a sustained and institutionalized reluctance” by staff members in Sri Lanka at the time “to stand up for the rights of the people they were mandated to assist.” The report’s executive summary says “many senior U.N. staff simply did not perceive the prevention of killing of civilians as their responsibility.” The report also found fault with the way senior officials in New York dealt with the crisis. Officials chose “not to speak up” about “broken commitments and violations of international law” by both the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels because that was seen as a way to increase access to victims of the conflict. A spokesman for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon refused to comment on the draft but said the final report would be made public soon. Lyse Doucet, the chief international correspondent for BBC News who obtained the draft, reported Tuesday that the executive summary, “which sets out the panel’s conclusions in stark terms,” was removed from the final report.

2012-11-14,Can American Diplomacy Ever Come Out of Its Bunker?,"When Ronald Neumann began his Foreign Service career in the early 1970s, he sometimes carried a pistol to protect himself. It was a reasonable precaution. American diplomats in those days lived without benefit of blast walls or security advisers, even in volatile countries, and consulates were at times housed on the ground floors of apartment buildings, with local families living on the upper stories. Neumann worked with a freedom that is scarcely imaginable for many diplomats today; he could go anywhere, by himself, and talk to anyone. In the early ’80s, when he was the deputy mission chief in Yemen, Neumann got wind of a threat to burn down the embassy building in the capital, Sana. The Arab world was in turmoil at the time, after an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and months of mounting violence. Much of the anger was directed at Americans. The embassy was easily accessible to any passer-by, an ordinary house in a residential neighborhood with no police protection. But Neumann — whose boss was out of the country at the time — did not close it down. Then things became more serious: there were rumors that angry Palestinians in Sana were planning to attack Neumann’s house. Neumann, a taciturn Vietnam veteran, took it in stride. “I brought a shotgun home from the embassy and locked the front gate,” Neumann told me. “My wife asked me if there was anything else we could do. I told her no. So she said, ‘In that case I’ve got some curtains I’ve been meaning to wash; I might as well do it now.’ I remember thinking, This is probably how they handled it when the Indian raids went down in the old West; just stay inside and mend the saddles.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/christopher-stevens-and-the-problem-of-american-diplomacy.html

2012-11-14,Strange Bedfellows: Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann on  ‘This Is 40’,"LOS ANGELES — Some couples throw themselves into their work so they can spend more time apart from each other, and then there are collaborators like Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann. This husband-and-wife team has become increasingly intertwined over the course of films like “Knocked Up” and “Funny People,” which Mr. Apatow wrote and directed and in which Ms. Mann played supporting characters. That partnership reaches a culmination of sorts in Mr. Apatow’s new movie, “This Is 40,” in which Ms. Mann and Paul Rudd reprise their “Knocked Up” roles as a married couple — not unlike Ms. Mann and Mr. Apatow — beset by problems at their workplaces and in their family. The film, which Universal will release on Dec. 21, also features Mr. Apatow and Ms. Mann’s daughters, Maude and Iris Apatow, who once again play the children of Ms. Mann and Mr. Rudd’s characters. All of which must make things interesting when the Apatow family goes home at the end of the day.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/strange-bedfellows-judd-apatow-and-leslie-mann-on-the-making-of-this-is-40/

Three companies — the SHS Group, the Council for Educational Travel-USA, and Exel — agreed to the settlement after the Labor Department accused them of overcharging the students for housing, reducing their wages to levels below those required by minimum wage and overtime laws. Hershey’s was not accused of wrongdoing because it contracted with Exel to operate the packing plant. The students were in Pennsylvania as part of a State Department-sanctioned education program, but the department has terminated the Council for Education Travel-USA as a program sponsor for forcing the students to do arduous factory work. Under a separate agreement with the Labor Department, Exel will pay $143,000 in penalties for excessive workplace noise and for failing to keep proper records about workplace injuries.

The screening is curated by the artist Casey Jane Ellison, who started an online archive and exhibition platform when she was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. “I wanted to create awareness for animation,” explains Ellison, whose hilarious alter ego, Case Case, is the anchor of the online pop culture journal Status Update. “So rather than people uploading their work individually on YouTube, I thought it was important to create a more curated context.” The selection of films will run the gamut from digital to analog — full-on C.G.I. to hand-drawn or stop-motion animation. Participating artists include Robert Bittenbender, Cody Critcheloe, Erin Dunn, Steve Emmons, Lauren Gregory, Ryan Whittier Hale, Rhett LaRue, Jacolby Satterwhite, Monira Al Qadiri and Lale Westvind, as well as Ellison herself, who will moderate a post-screening discussion. So what made her get into animation in the first place? “When I was little, I watched an episode of ‘The Sopranos’ featuring a dream sequence in which Tony is interacting with an animated fish,” Ellison says, laughing. “I remember being really affected by the emotion conveyed in that scene, and the element of surprise. That’s when animation is really good — when you don’t know where it’s coming from.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/cartoon-network-aboveground-animation-at-the-new-museum/

2012-11-15,What’s on Thursday,"9 P.M. (HBO) CROSSFIRE HURRICANE (2012) The director Brett Morgen culls from more than 1,000 hours of film, 500 hours of audio and 80 hours of new interviews to chronicle the 50-year history of the Rolling Stones and their transformation from, as Mick Jagger says, “the band everybody hated to the band everybody loves.” What sets the band apart from the rest? “A chemical reaction seems to have happened,” says Keith Richards (above, second from left, with his band mates Charlie Watts, left, Bill Wyman, Mr. Jagger and Ronnie Wood). “You can’t really stop the Rolling Stones. You know when that sort of avalanche is facing you, you just get out of the way.” Among the documentary’s highlights are depictions of the chaos that accompanied the band’s early tours; the birth of the Jagger-Richards songwriting partnership; the death of the guitarist Brian Jones in 1969 and the terror later that year at the Altamont Festival, where four people died; and Mr. Richards’s 1977 drug arrest in Toronto, which threatened to break up the band. In a recent interview with Jon Pareles in The New York Times, Mr. Richards pronounced himself amazed at the band’s longevity. “There is a certain magnetic glue that pulls us all together, that overrides any other peripheral things,” he said. “Once we get behind our instruments, there’s something bigger. The sum is greater than the parts. There’s just a feeling that we were meant to do this, we have to do this, and we’re just following the trail.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

In the last few years, Ljubljana has seen several notable museum openings, a new public bike-rental program and a major renovation of its Hapsburg-era opera house. With the country surrounded by Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, the national cuisine is infused with a cornucopia of influences; the capital’s latest restaurants are bypassing novelty and getting creative with traditional Slovenian fare. There are also surprisingly offbeat facets of the city, like Metelkova City, a cluster of clubs and galleries that opened inside a complex of former military buildings after Slovenia declared independence, in 1991.

If you were happy with the ideological situation on the right, you’ve probably either emphasized the practical deficiencies of the Romney campaign (his weaknesses as a candidate, his flawed turnout operation, his pollster’s rose-colored glasses), or else looked for a supposed silver bullet like immigration reform to solve the Republican Party’s demographic issues without touching the rest of the party platform. If you’re socially conservative and populist but skeptical of Wall Street and big business, then you’ve probably argued the party’s biggest mistake was to nominate a plutocrat and run a campaign tilted too far toward economic individualism and the interests of the rich. If you’re fiscally conservative but libertarian on social issues, then you’ve probably made the case that Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock and anti-immigrant yahoos took the focus off the economy, and that cultural conservatives need to pipe down and let the party modernize on gay rights, immigration and abortion.

His grandson and near namesake, Joseph Patrick Kennedy, was born in 1888 ﻿in a neighborhood now known as unfashionable East Boston. The rest, as they say, is history.

2012-11-16,Six Surprises of the Young N.B.A. Season,"The excitement of a new N.B.A. season makes it easy to mine surprises from small sample sizes. From hot team starts (Knicks, Clippers and Spurs) to redeemed expectations (DeAndre Jordan and O.J. Mayo) to rookie leaps (Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Damian Lillard), there are plenty of front-and-center narratives ripe for the double take. But what about the more under-the-radar story lines? Here are six developments to keep your eyes on.Rajon Rondo’s midrange shooting: It seems no discussion of Rondo’s place in the current N.B.A. is complete without a proper hand-wringing over the guard’s notoriously inconsistent jumper. So far at least, that qualm has been muted, as Rondo, Boston’s floor general, has quietly put up some of the best shooting numbers of his career: a true shooting percentage (which accounts for free throws and 3-point field goals) of 53 percent, including 50 percent from 16 to 24 feet, and 67 percent from 8 to 16 feet. It will be interesting to see whether Rondo can continue making teams pay for their sagging and hedging, but Boston will certainly pocket the found money as long as it can.",Sports,https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/five-surprises-of-the-young-n-b-a-season/

As is often the case, he was working as much with myth as reality, but that didn’t lessen the catharsis. Mr. Dylan, who recently released his 35th studio album, “Tempest” (Columbia), understands more than anyone how carefully his words are parsed. So there may be reason to anticipate a similar gesture at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday.

Over the years her work has deepened and enlarged. At the end of “Dear Life” is a suite of four stories that Munro says are “autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact,” and she adds: “I believe they are the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.” They seem to me as good as anything she has ever done, but also to strike out in the direction of a new, late style — one that is not so much a departure as a compressing or summing up of her whole career.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/books/review/dear-life-stories-by-alice-munro.html

One often hears that we in the United States are in denial about class, but it might be more accurate to say that we maintain a tight-lipped silence about differences we can all see perfectly well. We know the relative rankings of brands, schools, addresses, food and body mass indexes; we understand understatement. We even understand about understanding understatement and rejecting its clenched, single-strand-of-pearls aspirations. We did, after all, invent Target. In contemporary American fiction, class markers aren’t in short supply, nor are writers shy about using them. George Saunders and Deborah Eisenberg come to mind as American writers who are deeply aware of class — he the lower, she the upper middle — and who have each created an aesthetics founded in the sensibility of these ever-vexed class positions.

2012-11-16,‘Girls Love Math. We Never Stop Doing It.’,"I live in Los Angeles, where despite my best efforts, I occasionally hear a story like this: A friend knows an actress whose burglar alarm code — 2828 — serves as a reminder to her of the age she must never surpass. (The repetition adds a touch of hysteria, which I like.) Another friend lives next door to a model-actress who, in her late 20s, is considered to be so far out on the ledge of her prime that she was recently cast opposite a 40-something man as the mother of two teenage children. While the age distribution represented is biologically feasible (it’s possible that a woman could have her first child, with a 30-year-old husband, at age 12), child marriage is generally frowned upon even in California.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/girls-love-math-we-never-stop-doing-it.html

Mike L’Huillier, the bar’s manager, says a lot of the military personnel in the area had foam parties back home, so he decided to throw one of his own. But foam machines aren’t cheap, so L’Huillier fashioned one with a barrel from Slack Chemical, a wet-dry vacuum, a garden hose and plenty of dish soap. He called it the Monster. The photographer Alec Soth happened to capture the scene earlier this year when he was in upstate New York working on The LBM Dispatch, a newspaper he publishes periodically. The best part about getting to soak 250 people, according to L’Huillier? “You walk in the next day and it’s like you took the bar through a carwash.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/foam-party-photographs-by-alec-soth.html

But these chunks could be inconvenient at teatime. They often had to be dunked doughnut-style, because they wouldn’t fit in the cup.

Downhill from the gym, we see, is the ski-lodge-like cafetorium, which sits just behind the converted mansion used as an administrative building, itself uphill from a swath of pine trees known as “the Enchanted Forest.” Josefson could have reasonably included a glossary as well, as his Roaring Orchards School for Troubled Teens comes equipped with its own abstruse vocabulary. Students are classified, almost like Grammy Award nominees, as Alternative, New or Regular. Teachers do not restrain students; they “wiggle” them. Yummies are forbidden, and fibs must be turned in; students who break these rules can be sheeted, skirted, cornered, ghosted or roomed, or have their furniture popped.

It begins with how you buy things. On his new Web site, MenInCities.com, which goes live this week, a limited-edition collection of no more and no less than nine distinct but coordinating accessories is released each month. Everything, from worn-in leather wallets to antique-inspired beaded bracelets, is priced at $39.99. “I love that you can see the entirety of every collection on one page,” Alpert says. “I want our customers to be able to shop without distractions and just focus on the designs in front of them.” Pulling from previous experience as the designer for the boho jewelry line Ruby Kobo, Alpert’s first collection for Men In Cities is filled with easy, simple pieces that are enough to wear to the office (think muted silver cuffs and a deep blue bracelet with a small skull pendant). “I wanted everything to be straightforward. I design items that I feel work well together,” he says. “My personal style is T-shirt, jeans, accessories. But If you feel like a rock star and want to wear 10 bracelets at a time, go for it. We want men to be able to add character to their own look, just a touch of formality with a cravat or tie clip.” Men In Cities also offers styling tips, via illustrated guides. “The idea’s to introduce men to a new way of thinking,” he says. “There’s no right or wrong — it’s what you feel comfortable with.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/site-to-be-seen-menincities-com/

The hill’s identity, however, remained defiantly — irrationally, even — linked to its past, and it continues to be legally part of the borough of Manhattan. And while two train lines make it easily accessible today, the topographical and cartographic oddity feels like what it once was: an island unto itself.

On a visit to India this week, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who studied at New Delhi’s Lady Shri Ram College, renewed her old, frayed ties with India, paying homage to its independence leaders and meeting its politicians. The story looks at India’s relations with Burma, now Myanmar — historical and contemporary, ideological and strategic. Myanmar is a strategic bridge between India and Southeast Asia and a key component of New Delhi’s Look East policy. The writer also explores Myanmar’s relations with China, which has invested in large projects on the ground and “is clearly taking the new signals from Myanmar seriously.” And finally, as for the United States, another important stakeholder in the new Myanmar story, Mr. Lintner says, “no one expects the relation to be without some unease.”",World,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/newswallah-long-reads-edition-50/

(HBO) SAFE HOUSE (2012) Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington, above), a rogue superspy formerly with the Central Intelligence Agency and called “the black Dorian Gray,” is held for debriefing in a Cape Town safe house by an untested rookie, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), after dodging a gun-toting gang and slipping into the American Embassy in this thriller about the very bad things that operatives sometimes do in the name of country and company. Despite cutting among as many as four action scenes at a time, the director, Daniel Espinosa, “maintains a visually coherent, narratively rational sense of time and space, no matter how fast the story shifts about, which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house, slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The story, written by David Guggenheim, “ebbs into more familiar cynicism rather than building toward political complexity,” she added. Still, “ ‘Safe House’ is essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

(Above, wearing goggles in Lakin, Kan., in 1935.) “Mr. Burns has two aces up his sleeve in ‘The Dust Bowl,’ ” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “One is the copious supply of photographs and film of the dust storms themselves, awesome and apocalyptic images he can put on screen whenever we need a visual jolt.

Qatar Holding, which has a 12 percent stake in Xstrata, said it would abstain from that vote, citing “the sensitivities concerning governance issues in the U.K.” It is also unclear what may happen if the merger is approved but the retention bonuses are rejected. “There is a chance the combination may backfire,” Bloomberg News writes.

This year, however, the festival’s budget was drastically slashed, by 37 percent  (from $869,000 in 2011 to around $556,000 for the next three years) in a round of nationwide cuts made by the British Arts Council, the central source of government funding for all the arts.

2012-11-19,New On Savile Row | The Alexander McQueen Men’s Store,"Not much about the new Alexander McQueen men’s flagship (the world’s first) on Savile Row in London suggests the dark, dour designs that the late artist was often earmarked for. Not even the colors. The designer’s posthumous homecoming to the street where, at age 16, he worked as an apprentice at the bespoke tailors Anderson and Sheppard and then at the neighboring Gieves and Hawkes, seems a fitting return to the company’s British tailoring roots. Working hard to elevate McQueen men’s wear to a higher level of detail and tailoring, the creative director, Sarah Burton, worked closely with David Collins Studio to outfit the store’s interiors in the spirit of McQueen’s major muses like the arts, nature and military pageantry. Inside, the shop’s walls recall the faded grandeur of stately English homes, clad as they are with white plaster panels and acanthus carvings that, up close, are compounded barnacles, feathers and foxgloves. This play on nature continues throughout the store; display cases and tables stand on clawed feet, and tall mirrors are propped up by what appear to be squirrels. A narrow strip of red carpet meant to invoke a military procession traces a line down the center of the store, atop which stands a colonnade of brass clothes railings carved to look like a vertebrate. Perhaps the biggest extravagance is the back-of-house glass inspiration cube curated by Sadie Coles. The first exhibited work is a Sarah Lucas sculpture, “Icon,” from her “Bunny” series, that portrays the British dancer Michael Clark. Of course the point and legal stipulation of keeping a store on Savile Row is that there will be in-house tailors busy at work and visible from the street in their basement workshop. An important detail, among many, that the new McQueen store doesn’t overlook.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/new-on-savile-row-the-alexander-mcqueen-mens-store/

2012-11-19,"Easy to Wrap, Ready to Rock ’n’ Roll","AMY WINEHOUSE: ‘AT THE BBC’ This is a smart response to an awful reality. When Amy Winehouse died last year, it was unclear how much unreleased music remained. But there was still room to fill out her legacy, as this CD and DVD collection, which gathers recordings she made for various BBC productions over the course of her career, attests to. Musically, the performances are taut, all the better to steady Winehouse as she sang, which was necessary because even as far back as 2004, she could be as wobbly as she was ferocious. Live, she could play it straight, or indifferent, or aggressive, her voice an otherworldly mumble. When she roared, like on a 2006 “Tears Dry on Their Own” captured on the DVD here, it gleamed, and she brought real sass to standards like “Lullaby of Birdland.” The 2007 take on “You Know I’m No Good” is eerie, cutting and woozy. And some recordings open old wounds — is the barely-there “Love Is a Losing Game” from 2009 emaciated by aesthetic strategy or failing health? The DVD, an hourlong documentary about a 2006 performance backed only by guitar and bass in a tiny Irish church for about 100 people, is indulgent apart from the exquisite performance clips and snippets of an interview in which Winehouse recalls being flabbergasted by Thelonious Monk and Ray Charles in her youth. Performances like the ones in this set are too often considered detritus, less essential than an artist’s formal releases. But this collection reflects the breadth and power and, yes, wisdom of the BBC, the state-owned broadcaster that performs an outsize role in British cultural life, and with releases like this, may also be the nation’s official eulogizer as well.

2012-11-20,Miracle on 10th Street | ‘Magic Fingers’ Opens at Last,"It made perfect sense that “Magic Fingers” — a new experimental art space in the East Village — would make its debut on Halloween given the theatrical cover this holiday provides, but the opening had been postponed twice because of Hurricane Sandy. Instead, the pop-up gallery hosted an intimate inauguration last Saturday night with “Questionable Beliefs; Part 3,” an exhibition by the artist Danny McDonald. The evening began with various set pieces trickling out from the diminutive storefront: first a fortune teller, then Turkish delights dispensed from an emergency rations box, black light manicures administered curbside, a purple question mark funerary wreath was brought forth. McDonald is a veteran on the downtown scene having worked under Colin de Land at his American Fine Arts Gallery in SoHo during its ’90s heyday. The artist intended his presentation at Magic Fingers to read as a “tableau vivant in the form of a theatricized political cartoon.” As darkness fell, the curator Alison Gingeras emerged sweeping a witch’s broom, presumably to clear the area for McDonald’s alter ego Mindy Vale, who masquerades as a Gypsy horror drag queen. Minutes later with a dead megaphone in hand, Vale popped out of the front window lamenting the loss of electricity and the kinds of hardships many New Yorkers have suffered of late and then, sitting on step stool, proceeded to cut up $100 bill doormats and toss sections into the crowd as a symbolic Robin Hood gesture. The event’s crescendo was Vale’s karaoke performance of the Oliver Twist song “Who Will Buy?” before she ran up the block with three pink balloons headed for the after-party at The Pyramid Club. As Gingeras obliquely summed up the performance, “Mindy is the perfect ambassador to preside over this return to the East Village.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/miracle-on-10th-street-magic-fingers-opens-at-last/

2012-11-20,New (Kids) Label Alert | Ella’s Wool,"A year ago, Vibeke Kvan Johansen noticed that in the span of two weeks her local Brooklyn playground went from teeming with about 200 children to having just 5 or so on its jungle gyms. The weather, of course, had become cold. But the emptiness was still strange to her; in Johansen’s native Norway, where “a warm day is 30 Fahrenheit,” children frolic outside all year long. The secret: a layer of not-at-all-itchy merino wool under their clothing (right against the skin). Johansen, a former hair and makeup artist and mother to Ella, 4, and Mikkel, 17 months, asked nannies and parents in her neighborhood what their little ones had on beneath their outerwear, and not one said wool. So, she’s made it her mission to spread the woolly word, bringing Nordic knitwear brands to the United States and selling their bodysuits, leggings, hats and more on her Web site, ellaswool.com. Why wool? It’s a heat regulating material, absorbs 30 percent of its weight in moisture before feeling wet, is softer than cotton and is better for those with allergies or sensitive skin. But perhaps its best benefit is that it allows children to play outdoors when the temperature drops, which, if you’re a parent is always a good thing. (Active children eat all their dinner and go right to bed!) “It’s my mission to have as many kids as possible outside to play all year long — with style,” Johansen says. “I already see myself as the wool queen,” she adds with a laugh. “Maybe not of the U.S. yet, but at least of Park Slope.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/new-kids-label-alert-ellas-wool/

It will make it possible for a purchaser to take best-selling Sourcebook titles like “Dream Big Little Pig!,” an inspirational book by the figure-skating Olympian Kristi Yamaguchi, and “The Night Night Book,” a rhyming board book by Marianne Richmond, and essentially add a child as a character throughout the text. Heather Moore, a spokeswoman for Sourcebooks, said its authors were not offended that such alterations could be made to their stories. Rather, she said, they were excited about “another platform for their books.” The app is free but comes with only one digital book, to let customers test the experience. Two other books will be available for purchase through the app at $4.99 right away. Additional e-books will be made available once a month.

2012-11-20,The Not So Swiss Chalet,"Fifteen years in the making, the $337 million Alpina Gstaad is the first completely new five-star hotel to arrive in the famous Swiss ski village in a century. It opens this month in one of Gstaad’s most exclusive sections, Oberbort, a residential patch in the shadow of the Bernese Alps that’s sprinkled with multimillion-franc ski retreats and roaming dairy cows. As much as the Alpina summons the rich chalet atmosphere one would expect to find in Gstaad — fireplaces, goat-hair throws, fondue — there is much about it that’s refreshingly exotic to Switzerland. And that suits Onno Poortier, the Dutch-born hotelier behind the project, just fine. “There are enough traditional hotels in Gstaad,” he said. To start, the 21,500-square-foot Six Senses Spa comes from Thailand. (It has a Himalayan salt room and an appealingly primitive cave that’s used for couples’ massages). The cigar lounge was inspired by one inside the Partagás cigar factory in Cuba. There’s a Swiss stübli eatery specializing in fondues and raclettes, but also a branch of the extravagant Japanese restaurant Megu. Even the price scheme seems a strange hybrid: rooms start at about $910 per night, but that includes a $320 credit to spend on après-ski cocktails, among other things. The hotel jealously guards its Alpine serenity. Cars arrive not in a typical driveway entrance but in an underground passageway lined with hand-chiseled stone; it keeps exhaust fumes away and the air of privilege mountain-fresh.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/the-not-so-swiss-chalet/

He also had “carried out reconnaissance in the neighborhood of the Sejm,” the Parliament, a prosecutor said.

In “Anna Karenina” Tolstoy’s doomed heroine suffers against visibly artificial sets, a doll within an elaborate dollhouse, while in “Life of Pi” a boy and a tiger share a small boat in a very big sea amid long silences, hallucinatory visuals and no obvious story arc. In movies like these, as well as in “The Master” and “Holy Motors,” filmmakers are pushing hard against, and sometimes dispensing with, storytelling conventions, and audiences seem willing to follow them.

So as we wait for the Singularity, when our iPhones will become sentient and Siri will start telling us what we can do for her, many of the savvier fiction writers have begun to come to grips with the fact that the tutelary spirit of the quest for the human may not be Dante or Emily Dickinson or Virginia Woolf, but Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped start the revolution in computing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/a-working-theory-of-love-by-scott-hutchins.html

Aman Sethi’s first book, “A Free Man,” addresses this vacuum through the narratives of a small group of Delhi’s marginal, manual laborers: construction workers, rickshaw pullers, porters.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/a-free-man-by-aman-sethi.html

2012-11-21,I Spy,"Ian McEwan’s work falls into two distinct periods. His early stories and novels were all cool post-1960s perversity, a high-end parade of deadpan macabre and kink and sideshow eccentricity: ghastly death, corpses and butchery, bestiality, incest and pedophilia, insanity, dwarves. But since he turned 50, around the turn of the century, he’s published lovely historical fiction about the disastrous sexual misunderstandings of youth (“Atonement,” “On Chesil Beach”), and contemporary fiction about an ­alternative-energy researcher (“Solar”) and a deeply sane, happily married surgeon (“Saturday”). It’s as if Johnny Rotten had changed into Bono. And in the same way I like both the Sex Pistols and U2, I’ve enjoyed the best of McEwan’s fiction in both modes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/sweet-tooth-by-ian-mcewan.html
2012-11-21,Without Reservation,"In his 1936 essay “The Storyteller,” Walter Benjamin drew a sharp distinction between prose fiction, meaning novels and short stories, and actual storytelling, meaning spoken narratives passed from one individual to another. The essential quality of storytelling, Benjamin wrote, is lived experience: “Every story contains, openly or covertly, something useful . . . a moral; some practical advice; a proverb or maxim. In every case the storyteller has counsel for his readers. But if today ‘having counsel’ has an old-fashioned ring, this is because the communicability of experience is decreasing. . . . We have no counsel either for ourselves or for others.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/blasphemy-by-sherman-alexie.html

It is in keeping with the recent trend in complimentary revisionist histories of the administration, like “Eisenhower in War and Peace,” by Jean Edward Smith, and “Eisenhower: The White House Years,” by Jim Newton. Thomas tells us that once Eisenhower “extricated America from the Korean War in 1953,” his mission was to “avoid any war.” For that reason, Thomas, who teaches writing and journalism at Princeton and is the author of several books, concentrates on Eisenhower’s foreign policy and national security decisions to the exclusion of almost everything else.

The city’s political clout has long since shifted to New Delhi, and its economic might more recently to Mumbai. Yet its reputation as an intellectual and cultural hub still lingers — five Nobel Prize winners are associated with the city, including the economist Amartya Sen and the poet-novelist-painter-songwriter Rabindranath Tagore. But like the rest of India, this clamorous yet charming city is changing: in 2011, the democratically elected Communist government of West Bengal was voted out of power after 34 years. For many Bengalis, this political transition reflects a desire to catch up with the rest of India. Visitors exploring Kolkata today are in a position to glimpse an emerging urban modernity but still have the opportunity to explore the city’s rich past, which, for now, remains unavoidable at every step.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/travel/36-hours-in-kolkata-india.html

2012-11-23,France: Sarkozy Questioned Over Campaign Funds," After more than 10 hours of questioning by an investigative judge in Bordeaux on Thursday, former President Nicolas Sarkozy was put under caution as a witness who could face charges related to accusations that his 2007 election campaign received illegal donations from one of France’s richest people, Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oréal heiress. Mr. Sarkozy was not formally indicted but questioned as a witness under caution, meaning that evidence obtained could be used against him in a future prosecution, the Bordeaux prosecutor told French news agencies. The accusations stem from Mr. Sarkozy’s first presidential campaign; no longer president, he has lost his legal immunity. Mr. Sarkozy denies that he took any money from Ms. Bettencourt, now 90, or that his campaign benefited from any illegal fund-raising. Ms. Bettencourt’s former accountant told the police that she handed over 150,000 euros (about $192,000) in cash and was told the money would go to the Sarkozy campaign. Mr. Sarkozy’s party, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, is in the midst of a prolonged and bitter leadership fight. A Sarkozy protégé, Jean-François Copé, and a former prime minister, François Fillon, both claim victory in an internal party vote. Reports on Thursday said Alain Juppé, a former prime minister and foreign minister who helped found the party, would serve as a mediator. Mr. Sarkozy’s own popularity has been rising again.

2012-11-23,Spain: Citizenship Process Eased for Sephardic Jews," Spain announced Thursday that it would grant automatic citizenship to Jews of Sephardic descent as a further gesture of reconciliation after their ancestors were expelled more than five centuries ago. Sephardic Jews already benefit from a preferential naturalization procedure that requires them to live in Spain for only two years before claiming citizenship, but the change means that Jews will have to present only a certificate confirming their ancestry to claim a Spanish passport. The government did not say how many Jews it expected to apply for citizenship, but it noted that a large number of Sephardic Jews lived in Turkey and across Latin America. While estimates differ, the number of Jews living in Spain — 25,000 to 45,000 people in a population of 47 million — is only a fraction of the number who lived in the country before 1492, when Jews were told to convert to Christianity or go into exile.

In 2009, the director Ang Lee asked Rockman to produce visual inspiration for his movie “Life of Pi” (released Nov. 21), based on Yann Martel’s novel about a boy’s spiritual journey adrift at sea in a boat with a tiger. Knowing that the film would rely heavily on digital imaging, the filmmakers wanted a human hand to help visualize some of the “freaky biological fantasies” living in the water where the story takes place.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/alexis-rockmans-visual-inspiration-for-life-of-pi.html

It had been a rigorous six years, transitioning from my role as a full-time journalist always on tight deadlines to that of a therapist whose world was broken into slow, thoughtful hours listening and trying to help people come to a deeper understanding of their lives. My supervisor went over the filing systems, billing procedures and ethical quandaries like whether to take referrals from current clients, but we never discussed how I would get these clients.

(They’re pictured above in the museum.) In 2010, they moved to Paris and, while Leeman moonlighted for established fashion houses, the pair began making handcrafted kicks that soon ended up on the shelves at Bergdorf Goodman. Leeman said his shoes are targeted at footloose dandies who value old-fashioned construction. His latest collection, he said, channels “The Sun Also Rises,” with matador-inspired slippers (above) and soft suede moccasins. Playing with cultural references is one of Leeman’s favorite parts of fashion. “There’ll always be some influence from poetry, music, painting or literature,” he said.

2012-11-26,What’s on Saturday,"7:45 P.M. (HBO) RED TAILS (2012) David Oyelowo (above), Nate Parker, Leslie Odom Jr., Michael B. Jordan, Kevin Phillips and Elijah Kelly portray the Tuskegee Airmen, the much decorated — and woefully underrecognized — black pilots who flew thousands of missions between 1943 and 1945, many in planes, including P-51 Mustangs, painted with red tails. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the unit’s commander, and Terrence Howard is the superior who lobbies for the men to be given newer planes and more important missions. “The movie’s most exciting moments are its heavily computer-generated aerial battle sequences,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Anthony Hemingway and financed by George Lucas. “If the scenes of P-51’s weaving in and out of a fleet of Flying Fortresses are not especially realistic, they still provide sensations of Olympian loftiness and roller coaster dips.” Still, he added, “The movie is very blunt about racism, which extends from the top down.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

For another, this subject is a perfect illustration of the important of actually having a model – I’ll explain in a minute what I mean by that.

As part of the settlement, several hundred thousand Native Americans who own, or who formerly owned, land that had been leased to such companies will collect at least $1,000 each. American Indians with larger tracts of leased land will receive significantly more, the department said.

2012-11-29,What’s on Thursday,"6:45 A.M. (MoreMax) BEGINNERS (2011) In the first of two father-and-son tales starring Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer (above left, with Mr. McGregor), in an Oscar-winning role, plays Hal, the septuagenarian father of Oliver (Mr. McGregor), for whom he has two announcements: that he is gay and that he has terminal cancer. This film from the writer and director Mike Mills weaves together two love stories, one past and one present, that gradually fuse into a single life. Goran Visnjic plays Hal’s much younger partner; Mélanie Laurent is Anna, the French actress who sweeps Oliver away from his misery; and a scene-stealing Cosmo is Arthur, Hal’s Jack Russell terrier. “So much of ‘Beginners’ seems, looks, sounds, feels so hermetically perfect you may long for some air to blow, stir and even mess up its bright Los Angeles homes, the swanky old hotel where Anna stays and all these precious moments,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Even so, the movie’s attractions are undeniable, including its narrative design, which seems more complex than it is, but is engaging to piece together. And the performers are charming, particularly Ms. Laurent and Mr. Plummer, with his killer eyes (still seducing after all these years) and a voice that echoes in your ears.” In “Big Fish” (2003), at 6:50 p.m. on HBO Signature, Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom (Mr. McGregor is his youthful version), a traveling salesman from Alabama who has spent a lifetime embellishing the truth in this fantasy from Tim Burton, adapted from the novel by Daniel Wallace. Billy Crudup is Bloom’s estranged son, Will, a reporter in Paris who has been summoned home for a deathbed reconciliation, during which Edward elaborates on his biography. Edward’s doctor asks: Wouldn’t Will prefer to believe that on the day of his birth his father was subduing a legendary catfish rather than selling household gadgets in Wichita? “The movie insists that the only possible answer is yes, and thus chooses maudlin moonshine over engagement with the difficulties of real life, which is exactly the choice Edward has made,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

2012-11-29,Spielberg’s “Lincoln” and Its Critics,"In the wide-ranging online conversation about Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner’s “Lincoln,” it’s been interesting to watch the movie be praised and criticized for the same artistic choice: Its determinedly narrow focus on the month or so of politicking and debate that pushed the 13th Amendment through a reluctant House of Representatives. To the film’s fans — my op-ed colleague David Brooks and A.O. Scott are in-house examples, but there are many others — this narrowing brings the democratic process to life in a way that few political movies ever have, capturing “the squalor and vigor, the glory and corruption of the Republic in action,” as Scott puts it, and throwing Lincoln’s distinctive balance of provisional cynicism and ultimate idealism into sharp relief. To its various detractors, this narrowing is a betrayal of the true story of emancipation, which was actually settled on the ground more than in the halls of Congress, through the agency of slaves as much as by the votes of politicians, and which failed to deliver fully on its promises (thanks to Reconstruction’s failures, and Jim Crow’s ascendance) precisely because of the kind of compromises that “Lincoln” the film treats as the better part of political valor.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/spielbergs-lincoln-and-its-critics/

But in the case of Lijiang, population 1.2 million, in the southwestern province of Yunnan, the word takes on its slack-jaw-in-awe meaning. The horizon here is Himalayan, and the blue sky above the city’s stone streets, willow-lined canals and black-tiled roofs is reliably visible. This unusual (for China) troika of culture, history and natural beauty is why Lijiang’s Old Town — a Unesco World Heritage site and a center of the Naxi people, one of China’s most vibrant ethnic minorities — is a top destination for Chinese tourists and a new favorite of the passport-carrying crowd.

Food was the one part of opening a restaurant that Ogrodnek and his partner, Walker Stern, who cooked together at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, knew they had in the bag. Their pork shoulder, served with coco beans, literally melts in the mouth. Even their kale salad, dressed with fish sauce and lime juice and mixed with kohlrabi, stands out among the seemingly endless iterations of kale salads across the city. Ogrodnek and Stern had intended to keep their menu simple, and their prices low, but they abandoned that approach. “Our original plan was to keep it low-end, or more casual,” Ogrodnek says. “But as we got in the kitchen, we realized we couldn’t do that.” Brooklyn is grateful.Related: Interactive slideshow • Video Feature",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/edible-selby-batter-up/

Barr and Bernard were inspired to begin Henry after attending an illuminating reading by the short-story writer Gary Lutz. “His work is emotionally devastating,” Barr says. “We were expecting to be brought to tears by his reading, but when he began to read he was sort of giggling through the lines, and we became aware for the first time of this ripple of humor that’s coursing through the text.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/book-forum/

The lawsuit asks the courts to rule the order unconstitutional because it undermines the federal program. Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Ms. Brewer, said the program “is neither Congressionally authorized nor enshrined in federal law.” Ms. Brewer’s order reversed a longstanding practice by the state’s Transportation Department of giving driver’s licenses to beneficiaries of deferred-deportation action, like asylum seekers, by accepting their work permits as proof of their authorized presence.

2012-11-30,What’s on Friday,"2:20 P.M. (Starz) ORANGES AND SUNSHINE (2011) Emily Watson, above with Hugo Weaving, portrays Margaret Humphreys, a social worker in Nottingham, England, who, starting in 1986, exposed the deportation of as many as 130,000 children from orphanages and group homes in Britain to Australia between the 1940s and 1967. One deportee, now an adult, recalls being told at 10 that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents — mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit — were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. “This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreys’s 1994 book, “Empty Cradles.” “When she eventually faces a group of clergymen at Bindoon, she is met with absolute silence.” He added: “Rona Munro’s screenplay for ‘Oranges and Sunshine’ is unnecessarily flighty. As the story ricochets between Britain and Australia, the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots. What holds it together is Ms. Watson’s calm, sturdy performance.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html
2012-11-30,Russian Court Ruling Seeks to Ban Pussy Riot’s Videos," A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that videos of performances by the punk group Pussy Riot were extremist, falling under a law intended to rein in hate speech. The court called for limiting public access to Web sites and blogs displaying the videos. But the ruling is unlikely to cut off access to them, since it applies only to servers in Russia. One video from February shows band members in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior beseeching the Virgin Mary to rid Russia of Vladimir V. Putin, who was returned to the presidency in March. Last summer, three of the performers were sentenced to two years in a penal colony. An appeals court released one of them on bail in October. Thursday’s ruling cited “psycho-linguistic research” proving that the videos “humiliate various social groups based on their religious beliefs” and contain “hidden calls to rebellion and nonsubmission to authority.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/europe/russian-court-seeks-to-ban-pussy-riots-videos.html

Mr. Santos said that Colombia would withdraw from a 1948 treaty that allowed countries in the region to settle their disagreements in the court, which is in The Hague. In its ruling this month, the court reaffirmed Colombia’s ownership of a group of small islands but gave Nicaragua control of a portion of the surrounding waters. Legal experts said that the court’s ruling remained in effect despite Mr. Santos’s decision to withdraw from the treaty.

The narrative powers of fashion photography have continued to play a central role here; in fact the Museum of Modern Art’s first exhibition devoted exclusively to the genre was entitled “Fashioning Fiction in Photography Since 1990.” In recent years, technical developments in digital photography have led many photographers to tell stories by artificially enhancing or manipulating their images on the computer.

In the coffee-table book “Variety,” Tim Gray, Variety’s editor in chief, traces the magazine’s evolution decade by decade, along with the trajectory of American culture.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/tim-grays-history-of-variety-magazine.html

2012-11-30,Cultural Artifacts,"Toward the end of Orhan Pamuk’s 2008 novel “The Museum of Innocence,” there are a dozen pages of exhilarated writing on what the act of collecting can mean. After a brief, passionate love affair with a distant cousin named Fusun, the narrator, Kemal, obsessively amasses objects that evoke their relationship in 1970s Istanbul. He has become, he says, “the anthropologist of my own experience.” As Kemal grows older he takes to visiting unlikely museums in the cities he passes through, from those that dramatize the lives of artists, writers and architects — Gustave Moreau, John Soane, Cézanne, Mario Praz — to such particular institutions as the Museo del Mare in Trieste and the Musée du Temps, a clock museum in Besançon, France. In visiting these ­places, Kemal’s sense of what is possible in the disposition of objects grows ever deeper. As he views “the playing cards, rings, necklaces, chess sets and oil paintings of the State Museum of Württemberg,” he becomes convinced that Fusun’s possessions “deserved display in comparable splendor.” He realizes that objects beget narrative, just as stories need objects. (In a twist, it becomes clear in the closing pages that the novel is actually narrated by Pamuk — a novelist hired to tell the story.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/the-innocence-of-objects-by-orhan-pamuk.html
2012-11-30,Antarctic Eats,"“I am not dead,” exclaimed an astonished Capt. Georges Lecointe on awaking one morning circa 1897. Or perhaps we should say “complained.” In the throes of scurvy, his ship trapped in the ice in the black Antarctic winter, one of the leaders of the first major scientific expedition of the heroic age had been saved from death by a “last meal”: penguin that tasted like “beef, odiferous cod fish and a canvas-backed duck, roasted together in a pot with blood and cod-liver oil for sauce.” The poor man might have welcomed death.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/hoosh-by-jason-c-anthony.html

2012-11-30,Paglia on Art,"Camille Paglia’s new personalized “journey” through Western art history was born of her deep-­seated concern that Americans today are so overwhelmed by the constant onslaught of visual images that we are in danger of losing altogether our capacity for contemplation. “Culture,” she writes in the introduction to “Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art From Egypt to ‘Star Wars,’ ” “is now largely defined by all-pervasive mass media and slavishly monitored personal electronic devices.” The digital revolution has heated up our social interaction to the point where it has severely damaged our ability for sustained analytical thought, making the aesthetic encounter fraught with jarring interruptions and the chatter of competing visual and aural stimuli. Looking at art, then, is a discipline Paglia believes will help us retrieve the necessary stillness that can “realign our senses and produce a magical tranquillity.” Hence “Glittering Images,” a primer of sorts that takes its reader on a tour of 29 of Paglia’s favorite artworks, a list that includes the “Laocoön”; Donatello’s “Mary Magdalene”; paintings by Jacques-Louis David, Monet and Picasso; as well as examples of more recent trends like Pop, Conceptual, Land and Performance Art.

This, and their hobnobbing with everyone from rulers to fellow celebrities, from aristocrats to fascinating arrivistes, gives “The Richard Burton Diaries” considerable interest.

Art world sophisticates also credit him with a major role in the death of painting, which was written off as a medium in the 1960s, and with opening up the sacrosanct domain of art to every kind of subject matter — from celebrity portraits and Brillo boxes to adventures in drag and ads for plastic surgery.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/regarding-warhol-sixty-artists-fifty-years.html

In the downstairs library of the house on Thurloe Square in London that she shares with her husband and two children, a guest may find it hard to concentrate, surrounded as he is by a pleasant assault of objects and furnishings: deer antler sculptures by the Austrian artist Christian Eisenberger in the fireplace; walls of meticulously stacked art and design books; and hundreds of colorful glass objects, opalescent shells and fine pottery displayed on antique tables. This room is where Muggenburg, the jewelry designer behind Belmacz, receives guests, on sky blue leather Le Corbusier chairs, for tea served in tiny Japanese clay cups on an inlaid ivory and wood chess table from Syria. The parquet floors are hidden beneath lashings of bright Persian carpets, and ceiling space is shared between a translucent Flos fan and a clear Murano glass chandelier by Barovier & Toso. “It’s always been terribly important to be constantly surrounded by things that inspire me,” she says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/a-fine-mess/

In an era when advertisers often hired fine artists to add a touch of class to their campaigns, the “least commercial artist in the U.S.” (as Time Magazine described her) was persuaded by the Dole pineapple company to visit the remote Pacific archipelago and produce two canvases. The offer came at a critical time in O’Keeffe’s life.
