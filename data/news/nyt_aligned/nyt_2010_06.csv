Over the weekend Guillermo del Toro said he was withdrawing as director of “The Hobbit,” citing the continued delays of its start of production.

Set down beside a highway in an unprepossessing district of Amsterdam, it consists of eight well-kept playing fields and a two-story building that houses locker rooms, classrooms, workout facilities and offices for coaches and sports scientists. In an airy cafe and bar, players are served meals and visitors can have a glass of beer or a cappuccino while looking out over the training grounds. Everything about the academy, from the amenities to the pedigree of the coaches — several of them former players for the powerful Dutch national team — signifies quality. Ajax once fielded one of the top professional teams in Europe. With the increasing globalization of the sport, which has driven the best players to richer leagues in England, Germany, Italy and Spain, the club has become a different kind of enterprise — a talent factory. It manufactures players and then sells them, often for immense fees, on the world market. “All modern ideas on how to develop youngsters begin with Ajax,” Huw Jennings, an architect of the English youth-development system, told me. “They are the founding fathers.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Soccer-t.html

If the preceding composition made no sense to you, then you’re probably not in the target audience for a new work by Laurie Anderson, above with her husband, Lou Reed, that is written for dogs. On Sunday the Sydney Opera House will host the debut of Ms. Anderson’s 20-minute piece composed of high-frequency noises that dogs can hear but that are inaudible to human ears, Agence France-Presse reported. (For the owners of the recital’s intended listeners, there will also be spoken word and string music elements.) The recital, called “Music for Dogs,” is being presented as part of Vivid Live arts festival in Sydney, whose curators are Ms. Anderson and Mr. Reed. Announcing the dog-friendly composition at a news conference, Ms. Anderson explained that at a previous event, she thought: “Wouldn’t it be great, if you were playing a concert, and you look out and you see all dogs? And so I said, ‘If I ever get the chance to do something like that I would do it.’ ” (A concert listing advises that all dogs in attendance must be on leashes, and all humans must be attached to those leashes.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/arts/music/03arts-MUSICFORDOGS_BRF.html
2010-06-03,Christie’s Alters Gallery Management,"In 2007 Christie’s announced with great fanfare that it had bought Haunch of Venison, a gallery with locations in New York, Berlin and London. At the time many in the art world questioned the potential conflicts that an auction house could have in owning a private gallery, especially when it comes to issues like sharing clients or buying and selling at auction. Now the Haunch of Venison founders, Harry Blain and Graham Southern, are leaving the gallery on Aug. 31. While nobody wants to talk publicly about what caused the split, some contemporary-art dealers say Mr. Blain and Mr. Southern tried to buy back the gallery from Christie’s but were unsuccessful. “We decided we wanted to change direction,” Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. “We want to invest in the business and grow it, finding new spaces and building a bigger team. Harry and Graham felt more comfortable with a smaller operation.” Mr. Dolman added that Christie’s would continue to own the gallery and that it would be run with the co-directors Emilio Steinberger and Barrett White in New York and Matthew Carey-Williams in London. Mr. Blain said he and Mr. Southern planned to continue working together.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/arts/design/03arts-CHRISTIESALT_BRF.html

Last month Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Berlinger would have to turn over more than 600 hours of footage from “Crude,” his documentary about the Ecuadorians who sued Texaco (now owned by Chevron), accusing it of contaminating their water. Chevron said Mr. Berlinger’s footage could be helpful to the company as it seeks to have the suit dismissed and pursues an international treaty arbitration related to the litigation.

The group, Citizens Against Religious Bigotry, which includes leaders from the Media Research Center, the Catholic League and the Parents Television Council, said that the series represented a double standard in light of the network’s decision to censor an episode of “South Park” that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. In April, Comedy Central bleeped the audio of a “South Park” show that said a character was the Prophet Muhammad disguised in a bear costume. The move came after the show’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, were named in ominous messages posted on revolutionmuslim.com, the Web site of the Islamic group Revolution Muslim. Comedy Central said last month that it was developing a show called “JC,” in which Jesus tries to lead a normal existence in New York. The series has not yet been added to the network’s schedule or shown to the public. The coalition said it had written to some 250 advertisers urging them not to support the series. Tony Fox, a press representative for Comedy Central, said: “ ‘JC’ is an idea and an idea only.

The show, in which Ms. Fisher shares stories of her childhood with her parents, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and re-coils her hair in the coif she sported as Princess Leia in “Star Wars,” was called a “brut-dry, deeply funny memoir of a show” in a review by Ben Brantley in The New York Times, yet somehow escaped the attention of the Tony Award nominating committee. HBO said that its documentary will be directed by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey (“Monica in Black and White,” “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”), and will combine footage of the show, to be taped on June 25 at the South Orange Performing Arts Center in South Orange, N.J., with archival footage and other interviews.

2010-06-04,Revert,"Lynne Geyser writes: ""My son and I are in disagreement concerning the use of the word revert. The only usage I find acceptable is 'to return to a previous state.' He uses it (and claims that his Bahamian/English friends use it) to mean 'to get back to someone.' That is, instead of saying, 'I will get back to you with that information or with respect to that issue,' they say, 'I will revert to you.' Can you shed some light on this?""  Revert, as the major American and British dictionaries have it, does indeed primarily refer to a return to a former condition, belief or practice. For instance, George Vecsey, a sports columnist for The New York Times, recently wrote of the woeful New Jersey Nets, ""Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin and Richard Jefferson reached the finals in 2002 and 2003, but the Nets have since reverted to their haunted roots.""  Secondary senses of the verb include the legal one, denoting the return of something to its previous owner, as in the contractual boilerplate, ""All rights revert to the author after publishing."" In evolutionary biology, it can signal an atavistic throwback to an ancestral type. To someone familiar with only these traditional meanings of the word, ""I will revert to you"" might sound like a bizarrely personal take on either property law or genetics.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06FOB-onlanguage-t.html

In the press run-up to the release, a few commentators noted an odd trans-Atlantic drift in the book’s title, which was rendered “The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest” in Britain. As it turns out, this probably isn’t an instance of Larsson’s publisher nodding. According to Carol Fisher Saller, editor of the “Q & A” page at The Chicago Manual of Style Online and the author of “The Subversive Copy Editor,” a cheeky how-to book for comma jockeys published last year, “hornet’s nest” is the spelling in the 11th edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (preferred by Chicago), while the Oxford English Dictionary lists “hornets’ nest.” “Evidently the change for the U.S. edition follows convention,” Saller said in an e-mail message.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/InsideList-t.html

Throughout this blur of travelogue and food criticism, he sprinkles references to religion, history, anthropology, biochemistry and philosophy.

2010-06-04,The Message Is the Message,"By the late 1940s, the art gods (gallery impresarios) had decreed that commercial artists be banished from galleries and museums unless they hid their tainted pasts. Of course, this changed when Andy Warhol, who started his career as a fairly successful editorial and advertising ­illustrator-designer, turned the art world on its soup can. Since then, the list of crossover artists has increased to the point where, arguably, it is difficult to be a contemporary artist without having an applied or commercial art pedigree — or at least without once having designed a T-shirt. Yet one of today’s most celebrated artists, Barbara Kruger, who began as a graphic designer for Condé Nast and helped pioneer (along with Lawrence Weiner, Ed Ruscha and Jenny Holzer, among others) a genre that liberally employs typography and advertising techniques, met with initial resistance not from myopic art pundits but from shortsighted fellow designers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/books/review/Heller-t.html

Beattie’s influence, and her rumored proximity, seemed pervasive, a part of the cultural landscape. Her stories were appearing regularly in The New Yorker. Beattie’s feckless middle-class postgraduates, still mourning the demise of the ’60s, seemed like older versions of me and my friends, albeit with better taste. As clueless as her characters sometimes seemed, they were terribly clued-in, worldly and semiotically correct. Just as an earlier generation used to read Hemingway in part to learn what to drink and where to travel, we read Beattie in part to learn what to listen to and read and what to wear.

But, as Nick Carraway reflects at the story’s outset, “a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.” In this case, however, humility may hide behind the mask of hubris: it takes audacity to wrap the gilded name of Gatsby around your own shoulders and hope to wear it with grace.

The literary is assumed to be cerebral and artistic, the commercial mindless and entertaining. One suspects that nobody is completely happy with this divide.

If the receiver accepts the deal, the two players collect their shares. If the receiver rejects the deal, both walk away with nothing. Were humans perfectly rational, the receiver would accept whatever is offered: even a dollar is better than nothing, right?

The standard governmental practice for over a quarter century has been to rely instead on labor-market studies that analyze data from thousands of workers. My labor-market estimates of the value of life have been used by government agencies since 1982. The article also indicates that E.P.A. regulations costing a bit more than E.P.A.'s value-of-statistical-life estimate ""would be scuttled."" There are many E.P.A. regulations that involve a cost per expected life saved in excess of $100 million - far above any value-of-statistical-life estimate used for benefit-cost tests. The real challenge continues to be that of striking a meaningful balance between cost and risk so that we target our life-saving resources most effectively.W.

At the height of the anti-Vietnam War movement and urban unrest, such an unexpected stylistic choice amid the ­sacrosanctity of the Series was viewed as melodic defiance.

2010-06-07,Uncommon App,"A guilty conscience needs no accuser. The narrator of  “The Tell-Tale Heart”  knows this, as does Raskolnikov. But unlike them, Addison Schacht, the conflicted hero of “The November Criminals,” is less interested in committing a crime than solving one. And though no one in the admissions office at the University of Chicago has asked Addison to discuss the murder of his high school classmate Kevin Broadus, he uses the application’s essay assignment (“What is your best quality? What is your worst quality?”) as a chance to get some things off his chest. The result is no tidy, eager-to-please essay but a book-length spiel — concerning, among other things, Virgil’s “Aeneid,” Holocaust jokes, dope dealing, friends with benefits, classic cinema, adolescent ennui, Latin grammar and syntax, Jewish numerology, anti-Semitism, struggles with guilt, the hypocrisy of liberal politics, race relations in the United States, the philosophical downside of living in D.C. and, oh yeah, who killed Kevin Broadus. The list of topics sometimes makes this novel, Sam Munson’s first, feel a bit shaggy. But, more often, “The November Criminals” is both a thoughtful coming-of-age story and an engaging teenage noir. Think of it as an existential murder mystery for the stoner pre-­college set — Keanu Reeves’s  “River’s Edge,”  as written by Camus.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/books/review/Salvatore-t.html

Everyone, evena real champion of immorality, sees himself as good. Or as working for the good, no matter if his actions — looked at one by one — are transparently self-serving, murderous, etc. Kind of a strong argument against the value of terms like good or bad. People feel this way even now, in 1999, when we're all supposed to be repenting and wailing and gnashing our teeth. But you can't go through life without making any distinctions. And selling small-to-medium amounts of weed to safe, calm rich kids (which I spent much of my spare time these past four years doing) is not a behavior worth agonizing over.

2010-06-07,Shopaholic Confessions,"In 1883, Émile Zola warned that in the department store, then emerging as a hallmark of modern Paris, church doctrine had been replaced by the religion of the cash register. Even in today’s challenging economic environment, a saunter through any luxury shopping emporium confirms the accuracy of this view. So too does Linda Grant’s “Thoughtful Dresser,” a zealous affirmation of the consumerist creed: “I’m entitled. Entitled to be walking along Bond Street and entitled to go inside Hermès and inquire the length of the waiting list for a Birkin handbag.” An English writer whose novel “The Clothes on Their Backs” was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2008, Grant has no use for the spiritual counterargument: “Better people than myself might sit under the great dome of St. Paul’s and contemplate God and infinity. Good luck to them.” For her money, shopping is the ultimate “balm for the troubled soul,” even when times are tough. “Because in a recession the last thing I want to feel is depressed, and depressed I would feel if I was wearing dreary, cheap clothes. . . .

The calligraphy was done around 1095 by Huang Tingjian, a leading scholar and poet of the Song dynasty. The auction was held on Thursday by the Poly Group, which has a vast historic art collection and is one of the largest art auction houses in China. The buyer of the artwork remained anonymous. There was no independent confirmation of the record set during the auction. One report said the previous record amount paid at auction for a piece of Chinese art was $34 million, for a Yuan dynasty vase sold in 2005 at an auction in London.

The man stood only half as tall as the lead tank. But his body language made it clear: He wanted the slow-moving column halted, and halt it did, the huge treads on the lead tank grinding to a stop just a few feet from his face. It was a close call — the tank came perhaps a second or two of killing him — and it seemed to encapsulate many of the confrontations in recent days between the citizens and the army: the touch-and-go maneuvering, with soldiers not sure when to press on and when to retreat; the determination of the demonstrators, brave and unyielding in ways that might have been unthinkable a few weeks ago.”",Week in Review,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/weekinreview/06backthen.html

2010-06-07,Should This Be the Last Generation?,"Have you ever thought about whether to have a child? If so, what factors entered into your decision? Was it whether having children would be good for you, your partner and others close to the possible child, such as children you may already have, or perhaps your parents? For most people contemplating reproduction, those are the dominant questions. Some may also think about the desirability of adding to the strain that the nearly seven billion people already here are putting on our planet’s environment. But very few ask whether coming into existence is a good thing for the child itself. Most of those who consider that question probably do so because they have some reason to fear that the child’s life would be especially difficult — for example, if they have a family history of a devastating illness, physical or mental, that cannot yet be detected prenatally.All this suggests that we think it is wrong to bring into the world a child whose prospects for a happy, healthy life are poor, but we don’t usually think the fact that a child is likely to have a happy, healthy life is a reason for bringing the child into existence. This has come to be known among philosophers as “the asymmetry” and it is not easy to justify. But rather than go into the explanations usually proffered — and why they fail — I want to raise a related problem. How good does life have to be, to make it reasonable to bring a child into the world? Is the standard of life experienced by most people in developed nations today good enough to make this decision unproblematic, in the absence of specific knowledge that the child will have a severe genetic disease or other problem?",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/should-this-be-the-last-generation/

If this could benefit the Theater Aspen’s actors or students, I would certainly be amenable to it.” Mr. Sheen was charged with criminal mischief and assault after a fight with his wife, Brooke Mueller Sheen, in a home they were renting in Aspen last Christmas.

Cinemart Theaters in Tokyo and Osaka have canceled screenings scheduled for this month out of fear for the safety of moviegoers, after receiving threatening phone calls and warnings of protests from groups that consider the film “anti-Japan,” said a spokeswoman for the film’s Japanese distributor, Unplugged. Other than a showing at the Tokyo International Film Festival last October, the Japanese public has not yet been given an opportunity to see the movie. “It’s not right that a small minority of extremists could take this right away from them,” Ric O’Barry, a former dolphin trainer featured in the film, said in a statement, adding, “To do so is a clear threat to democracy.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/movies/07arts-SCREENINGSOF_BRF.html

2010-06-07,‘Fences’ Revival Recoups Investment,"The Broadway revival of August Wilson’s “Fences,” starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, below, has recouped its $2.8 million capitalization after only eight weeks of performances, the producers Carole Shorenstein Hays and Scott Rudin announced on Monday. The critically acclaimed production, which has received the most Tony Award nominations ever  10  for a play revival, began preview performances on April 14 and opened on April 26; the limited engagement is scheduled to end on July 11. Usually only one-quarter to one-third of Broadway shows recoup their original investment, and most require many months to do so; having popular stars in the cast has helped some recent plays, like “God of Carnage” and “A Steady Rain,” recoup more quickly. Like those productions “Fences” is one of the few hit plays in recent years that have grossed more than $1 million in a single week; the production has also twice set box office records at its home, the Cort Theater, most recently when it hit a figure of $1,024,316.50 last week. Among the play’s nominations for Tony Awards, which will be presented on Sunday, are best revival of a play, leading actor (Mr. Washington), leading actress (Ms. Davis), featured actor in a play (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and direction of a play (Kenny Leon).",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/theater/07arts-FENCESREVIVA_BRF.html

2010-06-08,‘Annie’ Revival Planned,"Little girls, little girls, get ready.

The 1977 Tony Award winner for best musical, “Annie” ran for almost six years and has spawned countless tours and regional productions, but it has been revived on Broadway only once, in 1997, a production that drew negative reviews from critics and ran only seven months. Ms. Madover declined to offer a theory about why that revival failed, but said that hers would be different because Mr. Meehan would be working with the script and “a new creative team will look to modernize the show.” The story (as if anyone didn’t know) of a little orphan girl who warms the hearts of Daddy Warbucks, Franklin D. Roosevelt and just about everyone except the mean orphanage manager Miss Hannigan, “Annie” will not be updated out of the Great Depression, Ms. Madover said. Rather, Mr. Meehan plans to look at the dialogue and the structure of the plot for ways to sharpen the storytelling. (Mr. Meehan won the 1977 Tony for best book, one of seven Tonys that the production received.)",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/theater/08arts-ANNIEREVIVAL_BRF.html

The concert was performed for the first time outside the Sydney Opera House on Saturday as part of the Vivid Live arts festival that Ms. Anderson is organizing with her husband, Lou Reed. The 20-minute work consists of thumping beats, whistles and high-pitched electronic sounds that cannot be heard by human ears, The A.P. said, as well as whale sounds that worked some four-legged concertgoers “into a frenzy.” (Others, The A.P. said, simply “stared at the stage with glazed eyes,” which in our experience is not necessarily an indication of a bad show.) A Jack Russell terrier named Oliver made a break for the stage, The A.P. reported, dragging his owner along with him.

The bands Gorillaz and the Klaxons have also withdrawn from the festival after the raid by Israeli commandos on a Gaza-bound flotilla. Last month Elvis Costello canceled two concerts in Israel this summer, citing the complexities of the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After the announcement of the Pixies’ cancellation, Shuki Weiss, the promoter of the Pic.Nic festival, said in a statement, “I am full of both sorrow and pain in light of the fact that our repeated attempts to present quality acts and festivals in Israel have increasingly been falling victim to what I can only describe as a form of cultural terrorism which is targeting Israel and the arts worldwide.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/arts/music/08arts-MOREMUSICIAN_BRF.html

Though he has made other films that required location shoots and took years to come together, Mr. del Toro wrote, “rarely do you relocate for such massive amount of time specially when you have to do major ironclad agreements to put in deep freeze other contractual obligations with multiple studios.” He added: “So  while the cited delays, contractual complexities or obstacles, cannot be attributed to a single event or entity  you will simply have to believe that they were of sufficient complexity and severity to lead to the current situation.” A new director has not been announced.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/movies/08arts-DELTOROSSADF_BRF.html

2010-06-08,‘Friday Night Lights’ Watch: Bad Parenting,"Once again Friday night’s episode of “Friday Night Lights,” proved to be an evocative treatise on miserable parenting. Early on we see Vince scouring the empty fridge in his apartment right before the camera finds its way to the image of his mother sacked out on a bench outside. She didn’t forget to pick up the milk because she is too harried; she is too strung out to remember to do it in the first place. The series checks off every category of bad mother or father: Vince’s mom is an addict; Becky’s mom is an obsessive too focused on the transgressions of Becky’s dad to really be in the moment with her daughter. Did anybody else feel worse for Becky that her mom was screaming into the dad’s voice mail during the pageant than they did over the fact that he didn’t bother to show up?And how about that pageant? (I loved Becky’s correcting of the M.C. — “It’s just ‘Wicked.'”) There is something so incongruous — in a good way — about Becky being on the beauty pageant circuit, since she is so not a Texas looker. The show hammered this home with its shots of her competitors. Her confidence — her aggressiveness with Riggins — is constantly at odds with her rebellious hair and unconventional prettiness, and I’m finding myself really riveted by the tension. Becky is also the first central female character to be ordinary looking. (Tyra, Julie and Lyla — knockouts all.) And what’s amazing is how self-assured she is in spite of her clearly bad family life. She knows how to perform: I like the way her confidence was contrasted with Vince’s, when he is asked to deliver a speech at a pancake breakfast after a great turn in his football game. He is at a loss and further confused by J.D. McCoy’s Dale Carnegie-like ease in front of an audience.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/friday-night-lights-watch-bad-parenting/

2010-06-08,The Life Aquatic,"There’s something about the onset of summer that prompts even the most diehard urbanites to dress like sailors. But there’s a fine line between indulging in a little naval gazing and looking like an extra on shore leave from “On the Town.” AANDD, a new line of three unisex bags from the architect/industrial designer Adam Davidson, gets the seafaring tone just right, with waxed rope handles and a predominantly navy color scheme. “I wanted to get past the usual garment center sources for hardware,” Davidson says. “So I looked at marine hardware and just fell in love with it.” The roomy Sea Bag is Davidson’s take on the weekender, with large exterior pockets and a detachable leather shoulder strap; the Sea Duffle is a cross between a shoulder bag and a sailor’s duffle; and the Courier is a leather messenger bag with a two-tone reversible flap that zips on and off. “Women’s bags tend to be bling-heavy, while men’s bags shy away from any risk-taking when it comes to details,” adds the designer. “The idea is to find the middle ground.” Aandd bags are available at Maryam Nassir Zaddeh, 123 Norfolk Street, (212) 673-6405.

Mr. Boyett, who holds the rights to “Funny Girl,” described the challenge of finding the right actress to play Fanny as formidable, partly because so many people associate the role  and signature songs like “People” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade”  with Ms. Streisand, who was only 21 when she took the part. With music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Bob Merrill and a book by Isobel Lennart, “Funny Girl” ran on Broadway from 1964 to 1967. Asked whether he had interest in casting Lea Michele, above, the 23-year-old “Spring Awakening” veteran who memorably performed “Don’t Rain on My Parade” this season on her television series “Glee,” Mr. Boyett said: “I think Lea is wonderful, she’s great, and she would certainly be on anybody’s list. She’s also got a pretty good gig going now” on “Glee.” “There have been a few Hollywood types who have expressed interest,” Mr. Boyett added, declining to name names, “but we’re also open to going with an unknown actress.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/theater/09arts-FUNNYGIRLNEE_BRF.html

2010-06-09,A Cult Denim Line Goes Mass,"When the designer Anne Johnston Albert shut down her East Village label and shop, Martin, in 2005 to move to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, cult-like fans of her jeans were, to put it mildly, dismayed. Martin resurfaced online, but the experience wasn’t quite the same. “In the store, you can tell what’s going to work on someone the minute she walks in,” she says. “But when you’re answering questions via e-mail, you’re working in the dark. I missed having the interaction with customers.” You can now have that personal experience again, but you will have to travel to Great Barrington. Germain, the clothing and home décor shop Albert’s opened with the interior designer Elena Litteron, features a carefully edited collection of jeans, tanks and easy dresses as well as mid-century furniture, pillows made from Swiss army blankets and other vintage fabrics, and pottery and photography by local artists. Though the new digs are decidedly more bucolic, Martin fans are essentially the same. “In the East Village, I had young rocker chicks,” Albert says. “This is a wider clientele. But no matter their age, everyone wants cool clothes that look good.” And the allure of perfectly fitting jeans remains as strong as ever. “I wasn’t familiar with Anne’s line before we opened the store,” says Litteron. “But I’m a convert. They’re the only jeans I wear now.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/a-cult-denim-line-goes-mass/

On Friday, to mark the 500th performance of “Hair” on Broadway, free tickets will be given to the first 500 people in line when the box office opens at 10 a.m. at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, the producers said. Directed by Diane Paulus, this “Hair” began as a free show in the summer of 2008 at the Public Theater’s Delacorte Theater in Central Park, before moving to Broadway in March 2009. When the Broadway production closes, it will have played 519 regular performances and 29 previews. PATRICK HEALY",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/theater/10arts-001.html

On Tuesday another warrant was issued for Ms. Lohan, and bail was doubled to $200,000 — this one revoked when she paid up.

A circular or “ring” narrative is one in which events come to a decisive point in the middle and then lead back, in parallel fashion, to the point of entry: ABCBA. Unlike a conventional (we might say ABCDE) narrative, which builds to a world-altering climax near the end, a ring narrative appears symmetrical and “exhaustively coherent,” like a snowflake. “When every element in the composition interacts with all the others,” Douglas writes, “and nothing is extraneous or unnecessary, everything contributes to embellish the pattern.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Row-t.html

The Guardian reported that Paula Claire, the only woman in the running for the position, withdrew from consideration, saying the election process was “seriously flawed” and favored another contender, Geoffrey Hill. Last year the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott withdrew from the election after Oxford academics were sent anonymous packages containing pages from a book describing a decades-old act of sexual harassment that he was accused of having committed. Ruth Padel, the first woman in more than 300 years to win the seat, resigned after it was learned that she had sent e-mail messages alerting reporters to that book. Ms. Claire, a poet in Oxford, told The Guardian she was frustrated that the university’s official announcement of candidates described her as a “performer and artist” but not as a poet, and that a flier in Oxford’s Gazette, the official journal of the university, said Mr. Hill was “quite simply a giant” and “the finest living poet in English today.” Ms. Claire said: “That is grossly over the top. They shouldn’t allow it ahead of the election.” A representative of Oxford told The Guardian, “No special arrangements have been made for this election that are inconsistent with normal university operations in this respect.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/books/11arts-LONEFEMALECA_BRF.html

Today, neoconservatives seem restricted for the most part to the Republican Party and are advocates of a muscular foreign policy.

The Tony Award statuette  a medallion mounted on a black pedestal with a curved armature  has gotten taller and heavier in advance of Sunday night’s ceremony at Radio City Music Hall. It now stands five inches tall, up from three and a quarter inches, and weighs 3 1/2 pounds, a two-pound gain. (The new model is above left, next to the old.) Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theater Wing, which administers the Tonys in partnership with the Broadway League, said the previous one felt light in the hand, and the change was meant to make it “feel more substantial.” “We know the physical scale of the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys,” he said. “While we’re not attempting to keep up with the Joneses, we felt this is a significant award, and it could feel and look a bit more significant.” When the first Tonys were given in 1947, winners received scrolls and a money clip, for the men, or a compact, for the women. In 1949, the award was turned into a medallion inside a presentation case. In 1967, the year the awards were first televised, the medallion was mounted onto a base.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/theater/12arts-THETONYISGIV_BRF.html

2010-06-14,Musical Version of ‘Elf’ Heading to Broadway,"A musical adaptation of the 2003 film “Elf,” which starred Will Ferrell as a human raised among Santa’s little helpers, will help kick off the holiday season on Broadway in November with a limited run at the Al Hirschfeld Theater through Christmas and New Year’s Day, according to three people with knowledge of the plans. Thomas Meehan (“Annie,” “The Producers”), who is writing the show’s book with Bob Martin (“The Drowsy Chaperone”), said in a telephone interview that “Elf the Musical” was in “very good shape, very fun shape” and was set to arrive at the Hirschfeld some time in November. The music is by Matthew Sklar and the lyrics by Chad Beguelin, who collaborated on the musical adaptation of the movie “The Wedding Singer.” Two theater executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the show ahead of its official announcement, said that the director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw (“Drowsy Chaperone,” “All About Me”) would direct “Elf” and that the run was expected at this point to be limited, similar to recent holiday-timed shows on Broadway like “Irving Berlin’s White Christmas” and “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas!” The current tenant at the Hirschfeld, the musical revival of “Hair,” has announced that it will close on June 27.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/theater/12arts-MUSICALVERSI_BRF.html
2010-06-14,Final ‘Twilight’ Movie to Be Split in Two,"Even if you’ve never read a “Twilight” book in your whole undead existence, you’re probably aware that “Breaking Dawn,” the fourth and final entry in Stephenie Meyer’s novels about a young vampire and the human woman who loves him, is possibly the strangest in that series. (Among other plot twists, the human Bella gives birth to the vampire Edward’s baby, and the werewolf Jacob becomes romantically bonded to that baby.) So what’s the best way to handle the cinematic adaptation of such a weird work? Break it into two movies, of course. Summit Entertainment, the movie studio behind the “Twilight” films, will release the film version of “Breaking Dawn” as two separate movies, The Hollywood Reporter said. Both will be directed by Bill Condon (“Gods and Monsters,” “Dreamgirls”), above, with the first part to be released on Nov. 18, 2011, and the second planned for the following year. The third, less strange movie in the cycle, “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” will be released on June 30. The breaking up of “Breaking Dawn” follows other cinematic literary adaptations that have been divided into two films, including “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” (which will be released in two parts in 2010 and 2011) and “The Hobbit” (planned as two films for 2011 and 2012).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/movies/12arts-FINALTWILIGH_BRF.html
2010-06-14,Brooklyn Party Space To Return In a Flash,"The party will go on. A week after the Bklyn Yard, the popular performance space on the banks of the Gowanus Canal, announced that it was closing, Justin Carter, a D. J. and promoter who has produced weekly events there, said his party, Sunday Best, would continue. “We’ve worked it out so we’re going to be able to have a shot at it,” Mr. Carter said in an interview. “The response that got poured out when people saw the space was shut down was really intense, and we think that people really want to see something happen here.” Before the shutdown, Sunday Best had already booked D. J.’s for this summer, starting with Dam-Funk this Sunday, who will appear as planned. (Above, the D. J. Michael Mayer at a Sunday Best engagement.) The space, now to be known simply by its address, 400 Carroll Street, has drawn thousands of people over the last four summers for a mix of outdoor dance parties, concerts, fashion and food events, serving as a destination in a developing neighborhood. Mr. Carter would not specify what deal he and his fellow party promoters  the D. J.’s Eamon Harkin and Doug Singer  struck with the landlord, but some changes will be made. The space, already sparsely decorated, will be “bare bones,” Mr. Carter said, though a spinning disco ball will remain. For now, liquor will not be permitted on the premises, though Mr. Carter said he and his partners would pursue the proper licensing to allow for that as soon as possible.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/arts/music/12arts-BROOKLYNPART_BRF.html

2010-06-14,Rodriguez Unavailable Again,"For a second straight game, Alex Rodriguez was not in the Yankees’ lineup because of tendinitis in his right hip flexor. His availability to pinch hit against the Houston Astros was not known. Rodriguez is considered day to day with the tendinitis, which is not believed to be related to the hip surgery he had in 2009. Manager Joe Girardi did not know if Rodriguez would be available as a pinch-hitter Saturday because Rodriguez did not meet with the training staff before Girardi briefed reporters. “He’s not ready to go and we’ll continue to evaluate him every day and see what availability we have of him every day,” Girardi said before the game. “He’s not a starter for us. I came to the ballpark not planning on starting him. I’ll keep talking to our doctors.” Rodriguez was not available to reporters before the game. Rodriguez did not play on Friday. He had complained of tightness in his groin area and exited after the first inning of Thursday’s loss at Baltimore. Rodriguez also exited early in a Yankees win over Toronto last Sunday, a day after a 14-inning loss to the Blue Jays. Asked if Rodriguez’s workout regimen to warm up his surgically repaired hip might have caused the tendinitis, Girarid said: “He didn’t have a problem until we played that 14-inning game on the turf. So is it more of his workload or was it more the 14 innings on the turf, a day game after night game? If I was a guessing man, I’d guess it was the latter.” Girardi said he did not know whether Rodriguez might be used as a designated hitter when he returns. Kevin Russo was listed as the Yankees’ starting third baseman on Saturday. Ramiro Pena started at third base Friday and went 0 for 3.",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/rodriguez-unavailable-again/

They flew for 38 hours before being forced down by engine problems near Bermuda and rescued by a steamer. The boat’s next mission ended less happily. In 1912 Wellman’s chief engineer, Melvin Vaniman, tried to cross the Atlantic on the Akron, the first Goodyear airship. It had barely gotten over water when it exploded, sending the crew members to their deaths. The lifeboat, however, was saved and has been kept in storage by Goodyear since then.

The musical will be Irving Berlin’s “Annie Get Your Gun.” While Glimmerglass put on “Kiss Me, Kate” in 2008, musicals will now become a regular feature, to be performed with a full orchestra and without amplification.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/music/15arts-GLIMMERGLASS_BRF.html

But fans hoping for some narrative closure may have had better luck with the “Lost” finale. The last “Annie” comic concluded with its title character missing in Guatemala, and, according to a caption, Daddy Warbucks “resigning himself to Miss Annie’s being lost forever.” A final panel bore the legend, “And this is where we leave our Annie. For now  ” But Steve Tippie, vice president of marketing and licensing at Tribune Media Services, said, “Annie is not dying, she’s moving into new channels,” according to an interview with BBC News (which also looks at one of Annie’s earliest comic adventures).

Ms. Osipova had attended a performance of Ballet Theater’s “Sleeping Beauty,” in which she is scheduled to dance on Saturday night, at the Metropolitan Opera House and was crossing Amsterdam Avenue on her way home when she was mugged, said the agent, Sergei Danilian. “Two guys just came from her back and they hit her and they took her bag,” he said. “She was so brave and so smart  she didn’t scream,” he said of the 5-foot-4 ballerina. Ms. Osipova had left her money at home and her computer at the Met, but the muggers got away with her point shoes and a small hammer used to shape them. The Met doctor was to examine her on Tuesday, Mr. Danilian said, and would determine whether she could dance full-out during an afternoon rehearsal or would just walk through it. She will “absolutely, no doubt,” perform on Saturday, he said. The police also interviewed her at the Met, he said. Ms. Osipova, who is Russian, is a star of the Bolshoi Ballet and in her second season as a guest artist with Ballet Theater.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/arts/dance/16arts-STARBALLERIN_BRF.html
2010-06-16,When Titans Clash: Poets’ Edition,"The carnival that is the election for Oxford University’s professor of poetry post added another ring this week when one of the 10 remaining candidates, the Beat poet Michael Horovitz, criticized another, the biographer Roger Lewis. The Guardian reported that the dispute was touched off by an essay in The Telegraph written by Mr. Lewis. The essay, titled “Now here’s what I call poetry,” listed details like the color “of Elizabeth Taylor’s eyes,” the “tilt of Garbo’s face in profile” and the “bend of Chaplin’s cane.” In a letter to The Telegraph, Mr. Horovitz wrote that Mr. Lewis’s list “was at first sight quite intriguing, but contained few allusions to actual poetry.” He added: “Mr. Lewis could presumably spout the hind legs off a donkey about these subjects, but how does this qualify him to follow Masefield, Auden, Graves and Heaney as the next Professor of Poetry?” Mr. Lewis did not immediately respond to Mr. Horovitz. Last week Paula Claire, the only woman in the running this year, withdrew from the race, saying it unfairly favored the poet Geoffrey Hill. Another candidate, Michael George Gibson, questioned Ms. Claire’s decision, saying last week that she “has rather flown off the handle with this one” and calling the election a “circus.” Oxford is to announce the election results on Friday.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/books/16arts-POETSEDITION_BRF.html

It assumes that developed countries cannot cut down on consumption.”  But “Last Generation?” isn’t a piece about overpopulation or environmental destruction, and it makes no assumptions about whether developed countries can cut down on consumption.  It just isn’t about that question at all.  It asks a deeper question, one not dependent on the environmental constraints on our planet, nor on the number of people now on Earth.  Even if there were only 1 million humans on this planet, all living at the level of an average citizen of, say, Switzerland, we could still ask whether it would be a good thing to have children in order to continue the species.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/last-generation-a-response/

The suit, filed by the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, asserted that the subsidiary, the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, failed to adequately track the spending of grant money from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. It also said that in some cases the Educational Broadcasting Corporation used money for expenses that were not allowed under terms of the grants. The grants were for the production of programs including “American Masters” and “Great Performances.” As part of the settlement, reached on Tuesday, WNET.org and the Educational Broadcasting Corporation agreed to adopt a plan to ensure compliance with federal grant requirements.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/arts/television/17arts-WNETUNITGIVE_BRF.html

Researchers for the National Committee for Historical, Cultural and Environmental Heritage in Italy said on Wednesday that they were confident that the bones found in the ossuary, shown above by Silvano Vicenti, president of the committee, matched those of Michelangelo Merisi, the artist known as Caravaggio. “We have carried out DNA testing on these remains and looked at the results alongside presumed relatives of Caravaggio, people with the same family name,” Giorgio Gruppioni, a physical anthropologist, told Reuters television. “We have compatibility with these genetic strands.” Theories about the artist’s death have had him succumbing to syphilis or being murdered. Caravaggio, who was 38 when he died on a beach north of Rome in 1610, pioneered chiaroscuro, the painting technique of contrasting light and dark.

Mr. Boyle, the “Trainspotting” director (who also won an Academy Award for “Slumdog Millionaire”), and Mr. Daldry, whose films include “Billy Elliot,” will be the creative heads of the London games, The Guardian reported. At an official announcement ceremony on Thursday, the 2012 Olympic Organizing Committee said that Mr. Daldry would serve as the overall creative director of ceremonies while Mr. Boyle would be the artistic director of the opening ceremony, which is scheduled for July 27. The Guardian said that the two directors would have a budget of £40 million (about $59 million) for a total of four ceremonies during the 2012 games, presumably a little more than Mr. Daldry had to play with as director of “Billy Elliot: The Musical.” In addition to that hit production, Mr. Daldry is also developing a stage version of “Dumbo” for Disney Theatrical Productions, while Mr. Boyle is directing “Frankenstein” for Britain’s National Theater.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/british-directors-will-oversee-ceremonies-for-2012-london-olympics/

2010-06-18,British Directors Will Oversee 2012 Olympics Ceremonies,"Short of a feel-good movie about young Scottish heroin addicts who aspire to become ballet dancers, the 2012 Summer Olympics have found a more constructive way to bring the filmmakers Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry together. Mr. Boyle, the “Trainspotting” director (who also won an Academy Award for “Slumdog Millionaire”), and Mr. Daldry, whose films include “Billy Elliot,” will be the creative heads of the London games, The Guardian reported. At an announcement ceremony on Thursday, the 2012 Olympic Organizing Committee said that Mr. Daldry would be the overall creative director of ceremonies while Mr. Boyle would be the artistic director of the opening ceremony, which is scheduled for July 27, 2012. The Guardian said that the directors would have a total of £40 million (about $59 million) to present four ceremonies during the 2012 games, presumably a little more than Mr. Daldry had to play with as director of “Billy Elliot: The Musical.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/18arts-BRITISHDIREC_BRF.html

Shows Plan For Tower,"The controversial 38-story tower that New York University seeks to add to its University Village complex in Greenwich Village would be made of concrete with floor-to-ceiling windows on the Bleecker Street side, according to plans, above, made public Thursday by the university. The design by Grimshaw Architects, published in The Wall Street Journal, calls for a 240-room hotel in the bottom 15 floors for visiting professors and university guests that would also be available to the public. The top floors would be for faculty housing. Opponents of the tower, show above in a rendering as seen from Houston and Greene Streets, have objected to adding a fourth building to the original three-tower modernist design by the architect I. M. Pei. The University Village site received landmark status in 2008. As a result, the university’s plans must be approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. On Monday the university is scheduled to make a preliminary presentation to the local community board. The building is part of a plan to add six million square feet of classrooms, dormitories and offices over the next 20 years on the core campus and at locations like Governors Island, downtown Brooklyn and the East Side of Manhattan.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/design/18arts-NYUSHOWSPLAN_BRF.html
2010-06-18,‘The Octoroon’ Director Withdraws,"The director Gavin Quinn, a founder of the Irish theater troupe Pan Pan, has withdrawn from the coming Off Broadway production of “The Octoroon: An Adaptation of The Octoroon Based on The Octoroon” after creative disagreements with the play’s author, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Vallejo Gantner, the artistic director of the New York theater company Performance Space 122, which is producing the show, said in an interview on Thursday that the two artists agreed that Mr. Quinn would withdraw from the project because each of them had different visions. “Sometimes collaborations don’t work out, and this is one of those times,” Mr. Gantner said. Mr. Quinn’s production of “The Crumb Trail” at P.S. 122 drew acclaim last year. Neither he nor Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins could immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins’s most recent production was “Neighbors,” which drew attention for its use of blackface and minstrelsy when the work was presented this winter in the Public Theater Lab series. He will now direct “The Octoroon,” which is described by P.S. 122 as a “bombastic, supertheatrical, full-scale investigation” of the intersection of theater and identity politics involving “The Octoroon,” a 19th-century melodrama by the Irish playwright Dion Boucicault about the residents of a Louisiana plantation and a mixed-race romance. Performances are to begin on Saturday, three days later than originally planned, to give the cast more time to work on the production. The play is scheduled to run through July 3.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/theater/18arts-THEOCTOROOND_BRF.html

As the title character, a 21-year-old man-child with a manic stare, an endless supply of neatly laundered button-down shirts and a seriously unhealthy attachment to his mother, he looks like the kind of guy who has been setting fire to the neighborhood cats, the one everyone says seemed so nice after the cops dig up the bodies.

Mr. Mayer isn’t ready to say. “I’m really not trying to be coy, but I don’t want to overexplain it,” said Mr. Mayer, the Tony Award-winning director of “Spring Awakening,” in a telephone interview. He added: “By playing a little bit with gender, I thought I could make a different kind of love triangle at the center of it.

The mudslinging started earlier this week when Michael Horovitz, the Beat poet and one of 10 remaining contenders for the Oxford post, criticized an essay by a fellow candidate, Roger Lewis, that was published in The Telegraph newspaper. Perhaps sensing an opportunity for a bit of mischief  and to promote his own candidacy for the Oxford position  Michael George Gibson has insinuated himself into the debate with a letter to The Telegraph, a copy of which was also sent to The New York Times. With a poem of his own, Mr. Gibson writes of Mr. Lewis:That Ox.Prof.Po.Candidate, Roger,Is a diss-all-his-rivals old codgerWhose Telegraph prose-hymnProsodically shows himA ‘My Favo rite-Things’ silly splodger.

2010-06-18,Spare Times: For Children,"SUMMER SOLSTICE CELEBRATION June 22, 1633, did not go well for Galileo Galilei. On that day, the summer solstice, the Inquisition forced him to renounce his theories of a Sun-centered planetary system. What a difference a few centuries make. Galileo would no doubt be gratified that on June 20, 2010, in honor of the solstice, a major scientific institution is offering a festival that builds on his work. That’s the American Museum of Natural History, whose Summer Solstice Celebration (the actual solstice is Monday) promises to bring light to any benighted minds — particularly children’s — who might underestimate the Sun’s importance. “You’d be surprised at how many people think the Sun is moving around the Earth,” said Suzanne Morris, the museum’s associate manager of public programs. There’s no chance of making that mistake at the festival, which will include an inflatable planetarium in which museum educators will hold demonstrations illustrating the Earth’s motion and explaining the summer solstice, which occurs when the tilt of the Earth’s axis maximizes the hours of daylight. Families can look at the Sun safely through a solar telescope and examine it indirectly (above, right) with a device to observe sunspots. “It reflects an image of the Sun onto a piece of paper, so you can see the contrast,” Ms. Morris said. In a nod to the Sun’s cultural importance, the Rose Center for Earth and Space will host an ancient solstice ceremony by members of the Kichwa Nation, a group representing the Andean peoples. Activity stations will demonstrate the Sun’s power. In what might be called cool chemical reactions, children can make solar prints (images created with chemically treated paper and sunlight) and UV bead bracelets, which turn from white to colored in sunshine. To emphasize “that energy is possible without batteries and electric cords,” Ms. Morris said, the Arthur Ross Terrace will become a mini Indy 500 for racing solar-powered model cars. She acknowledged that the Sun can be a temperamental guest of honor. Indoor activities, like making Sun models from clay, will take place regardless of weather. And young visitors should come away knowing that whether or not it shows its face, the Sun is undeniably a star. (Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Rose Center, 81st Street and Central Park West, 212-769-5200, amnh.org. Free with suggested museum admission: $16; $12 for ages 62+ and students; $9 for 2 to 12; free for under 2 and members.) LAUREL GRAEBER ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/18kids.html

2010-06-18,Implacability,"In my recent column on cool, I wrote, ""From Old English to the ages of Chaucer and Shakespeare all the way to the present, cool has been able to mean 'dispassionate, calm, self-composed.' Some of our latter-day cool expressions — 'stay cool,' 'play it cool,' 'cool as a cucumber,' 'cool customer' — play off this ancient connotation of implacability."" Catherine Harris e-mails: ""I believe you meant to use imperturbability rather than implacability, describing the calm sense of cool. Someone who is implacable is relentless and unappeasable, not necessarily perpetually unruffled.""   If there's one lesson I learned from many years of reading my illustrious predecessor William Safire, it's to show humility when called out by the Gotcha Gang. In a 1984 column, he introduced the Gotcha Gang as ""that shock troop of Lexicographic Irregulars who specialize in correcting other language mavens."" Safire later revealed the hidden benefit of publicizing Gotchas: ""By ostentatiously wolfing down one slim slice of humble pie, I buy the license to take pops at everybody else for months without appearing to be a wiseguy.""  Let this be my first On Language mea culpa: Harris (along with fellow Gotcha-ers Brian Hoffman, Peter Glasgow and Wade Richardson) rightly questions my use of implacability, which does not quite fit in the context of cool. Imperturbability would indeed have been a better choice, as would the more modern unflappability.  I cop to the malaprop, though my mix-up was not as blatant or farcical as the eponymous Mrs. Malaprop's constant misuse of language in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1775 play ""The Rivals"" (e.g., ""He is the very pineapple of politeness,"" with pineapple standing in for pinnacle). I might have been influenced in my word choice by such cool words as placid and placate, but of course, implacability tends to imply just the opposite, an inability to be made calm.  In my modest defense, the ""relentless, steadfast"" shade of implacability can intersect with the unruffled nature of imperturbability, and in fact the adjectives implacable and imperturbable often appear side by side - or as linguists would say, they can easily ""collocate"" with each other. For instance, the newly published translation of Simone de Beauvoir's ""Second Sex"" by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier contains a line about ""precise, imperturbable, implacable logic.""  The overlap in usage between the two words doesn't absolve the linguistic error, however. In a vicious dissection of James Fenimore Cooper's many ""literary offenses,"" Mark Twain offered some simple rules for writing as an antidote. My favorite is: ""Use the right word, not its second cousin."" This advice hits close to home, since I work as executive producer of the Visual Thesaurus, which essentially creates interactive family trees of words with similar meanings. Implacability and imperturbability might have a passing family resemblance, but it's best not to treat them as blood brothers.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20FOB-onlanguage-t.html

2010-06-18,Inside the List,"BECK BUMP: Swedish socialism may still rule the hardcover fiction list, via Stieg Larsson’s megahit “The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest.” But Larsson, who died in 2004, was recently given a run for his money by the free-market Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek (who died in 1992), thanks to a mighty fist-bump from Glenn Beck. Hayek’s classic treatise “The Road to Serfdom,” first published in the United States in 1944, shot to the No. 1 spot at both Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com after Beck devoted the entire June 8 episode of his television show to the book. A perennial seller for the University of Chicago Press, Hayek’s libertarian cri de coeur had already received a big boost from Barack Obama, who has been cited by conservative pundits as the embodiment of the kind of creeping government tyranny that Hayek warned of. After Obama’s election, sales went from about 7,000 copies a year to almost 30,000, according to Garrett Kiely, director of the press. After Beck’s program, the book sold about 60,000 to 70,000 copies in one week. This surge came too late to push the book onto this week’s paperback nonfiction list, which records sales until June 12.

Although the bloodletting has ebbed, Kyrgyzstan, an obscure central Asian country that houses American and Russian military bases, remains in serious danger of fragmenting.

And few shops in Europe are more faithfully dedicated to heirloom denim and classic work wear than the new Stockholm shop Mr. Mudd and Mr. Gold. The name alone, taken from a Townes Van Zandt classic, is like Carhartts incarnate. The shop, in Södermalm, the city’s answer to Brooklyn and the only party of town that could be called gritty, is outfitted almost entirely in unfinished knotty pine boards; they line the walls and form blocky benches and tables for merchandise that includes Mr. Freedom work shirts, Quoddy moccasins, Pendleton blankets and Wesco motorcycle boots. And true to the cult of craftsmanship, the narrative behind every company the store does business with is highlighted on its Web site. The expertly focused selection of brands includes plenty of international origin — canvas satchels from Brady Bags of England, founded in 1877; Grunden rain gear (Sweden, 1926); jeans by The Real McCoy’s (Japan, 1990) — but the effect is nonetheless a mashup of styles that feels unmistakably American.

And in the end, the front-runner won, anyway. On Friday Oxford said that Geoffrey Hill, author of “King Log,” “Mercian Hymns” and “Without Title,” had won the election to become the university’s 44th professor of poetry. Mr. Hill claimed the victory with a commanding lead, winning 1,156 of more than 2,500 votes; the next closest candidate was Michael Horovitz, the Beat poet, who picked up 353 votes. The voting was open to Oxford alumni and academics. Paula Claire, who was the only woman vying for the position this year, predicted the outcome when she pulled out of the election earlier this month, saying it was “seriously flawed” and too heavily tilted in favor of Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill, an Oxford graduate, is to assume the mantle of poetry professor in the fall, succeeding Christopher Ricks. The post was left open last year after Ruth Padel, the first woman in more than 300 years to win the seat, resigned after it was learned she had alerted reporters to a book describing a decades-old act of sexual harassment that Derek Walcott, a 2009 candidate, was accused of having committed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/books/19arts-AFTERROUGHCA_BRF.html

The two played the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in April, where Mr. Garfunkel complained from the stage that his voice was “a little elusive.” That show was to have kicked off a tour, but within a few days it was postponed.

The movers replaced the window with simple colored panes. “It happened very quickly,” said Karen Davis, a trustee of First Baptist. “It’s sad for the church for sure.” The proceeds will pay for repairs to the Gothic brick building and to operate a homeless shelter.

The corrected version adds the phrase “I love to turn you on,” which helped to get the song banned in Britain by the BBC when the album was released in 1967 because of the line’s implication of drug use. (The lyrics differ slightly in the finished recording.) The album won four Grammy Awards in 1968.

The foundation praised Mr. Kentridge, above, in a statement on its Web site “for his originality as an artist whose wide-ranging activities encompass drawing, animation, stage direction and writing.” It continued, “His deep insights and profound reflections on the nature of human existence provide opportunities to consider fundamental issues that could face any individual in the world.” Mr. Kentridge joins two other winners: Dr. Shinya Yamanaka, a Japanese medical scientist who will be awarded the prize for advanced technology, and the Hungarian mathematician Laszlo Lovasz, who will receive the award for basic sciences.

I said to David the translator, ‘Who wrote this book?’ I didn’t recognize it. I thought it was very good. It made me realize it really is a book, and I am a writer.” “The Twin” is about a man who resigns himself to taking over his family’s farm in the remote Dutch countryside after his twin brother dies in a car accident. It was first published by Uitgeverij Cossee in Amsterdam in 2006 and published in English in Britain two years later by Harvill Secker.

That stands in contrast with Falla, who crumpled in the fifth set after losing the fourth-set tiebreaker, 7-1.

Today we will explore a fundamental and almost unbelievable result of Quantum Mechanics (QM) through a set of simple puzzles. This famous result is “Bell’s Interconnectedness Theorem” which was discovered by the physicist John Stewart Bell in 1964. Bell’s theorem has been called by physicist Henry Stapp “the most profound discovery of Science.” It is profound because it shows that the universe has the property of non-locality: two particles can be light years apart, yet they are linked to each other instantaneously. How instantaneously? Recent measurements have shown that this phenomenon occurs more than 10,000 times the speed of light! In order to show that the universe in non-local, Bell showed that a certain simple and obvious inequality – Bell’s inequality – is violated. Amazingly, the only math that you need to understand this profound inequality is contained in the following simple problem.",Crosswords & Games,https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/numberplay-spooky-action-at-a-distance/

Ariel Levy’s profile of Huckabee, in this week’s New Yorker, lines up plenty of reasons why this might be flat wrong, from Huckabee’s proven inability to raise money or organize a ground game, to his perpetually-simmering war with the conservative establishment, to his tendency to self-pigeonhole (his protests to the contrary notwithstanding) as the candidate of Southern evangelicals and only Southern evangelicals. (There’s also the fact that he might just be happier as a well-compensated entertainer than as a politician.) But Levy also captures many of the qualities that make Huckabee more formidable than many handicappers acknowledge: His immense charm and “relentless niceness,” his intense bond with one of the G.O.P.’s largest constituencies, his high favorable numbers among Republican voters and his strength in early polls.

Because of its strict policies against deaccessioning art to pay operating costs, the Association of Art Museum Directors advised other museums to cut off all loans to the 184-year-old academy and forgo any collaborations.

Walker, the president and chief executive, said the appointment was not adding another layer but rather a move she had long envisioned. “In fact, it’s a pretty lean staff,” she said. “The audience for the station is very high, and it deserves its own leader.” Orpheus said that its general manager, Jim Bredeson, would be acting executive director while a replacement is sought.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/arts/music/22arts-WNYCHIRESAVI_BRF.html

The city has argued for the importance of honoring the original master plan for ground zero, which calls for a performing arts center in the area bounded by Fulton, Greenwich, Vesey and Washington Streets  the architect Frank Gehry was selected in 2004 to design the building for its anchor tenant, the Joyce Theater. The Port Authority’s plan to address the infrastructure issue “is a tangible sign that the performing arts center is moving forward,” Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce, said on Monday. “There were a lot of skeptics that this wouldn’t happen, but this is a great step forward.” The Port Authority and the development corporation declined to comment on their expectations for Tuesday’s meeting.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/arts/design/22arts-ATGROUNDZERO_BRF.html

2010-06-22,Sophie Hicks | Chloé’s Architect,"“If I were to put a dress on, I wouldn’t look like a woman,” says Sophie Hicks. “I’d look like a man in drag.” The sternly chic British architect began wearing mannish suits as a fashion editor at glossies like Tatler and British Vogue. Then, in the late 1980s, she quit her editorial job and went to architecture school. Sure, high fashion frustrated her. (Madonna, at the very last moment, once bailed on a big photo shoot that Hicks had dreamed up with Azzedine Alaïa.) But Hicks’s concerns about the industry went deeper. “I was only 26, and I started seeing fashion go in circles,” she says, noting that the legends she worked alongside — like Grace Coddington — “must have seen the same things go around 12 dozen times.” Hicks’s biography has fabulous footnotes: She appeared in a Fellini film (“Intervista,” in 1986), designed a Picasso exhibit for the Royal Academy of Arts, and made a perfume bottle for Paul Smith. Her most famous buildings are, perhaps predictably, fashion boutiques. She has designed shops for Yohji Yamamoto in Paris, Paul Smith in London and 100 or so Chloé stores, including flagships in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong. Today, she’s at work on a small home in South Kensington. For that building, she’s invented a “geometric building block” with the British brick maker Ibstock. “It’s a bit like mesh,” she says of the partially translucent brick. “So you’ll get little glimpses of what’s going on outside.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/sophie-hicks-chloes-architect/

The novel, called “Annexed,” and written by Sharon Dogar, is told from the point of view of Peter van Pels, a teenage son of the Dutch family called the van Daans in Anne’s diaries. A report published Sunday in The Times of London said the novel included scenes of Peter yearning for and having a physically intimate relationship with Anne. But the book’s depiction of Anne and Peter was disputed by Buddy Elias, Anne’s only living relative. “Anne was not the child she is in this book,” Mr. Elias told The Times. “I also do not think that their terrible destiny should be used to invent some fictitious story.” In an interview with The Guardian, Ms. Dogar said she had corresponded with Mr. Elias about the project and said the novel did not overemphasize Anne’s sexuality. “The sexual awakening of Anne plays more of a major part in her diary than this book,” she said.

Polaroid, founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land, fell victim to the digital revolution, going bust in 2001 and again in 2008.

But no general is indispensable. What is indispensable is that when taking America surging deeper into war in Afghanistan, President Obama has to be able to answer the most simple questions at a gut level: Do our interests merit such an escalation and do I have the allies to achieve victory? President Obama never had good answers for these questions, but he went ahead anyway. The ugly truth is that no one in the Obama White House wanted this Afghan surge. The only reason they proceeded was because no one knew how to get out of it  or had the courage to pull the plug. That is not a sufficient reason to take the country deeper into war in the most inhospitable terrain in the world. You know you’re in trouble when you’re in a war in which the only party whose objectives are clear, whose rhetoric is consistent and whose will to fight never seems to diminish is your enemy: the Taliban.

Most of us know that, of course. The carbohydrates in the drinks provide immediate fuel, which allows our bodies to avoid dipping into its own energy stores, meaning that, theoretically, you can exercise longer or more intensively before running out of fuel. But few people, in practice, can or will drink enough calories during a long workout to benefit significantly, the study authors suggest. The volume of fluid needed is, to say the least, daunting. Achieving the ideal “carbohydrate-intake rates,” the authors write, requires toting and stomaching about a half gallon of a typical sports drink every hour.

2010-06-24,‘Imperial Bedrooms’,"They had made a movie about us. The movie was based on a book written by someone we knew. The book was a simple thing about four weeks in the city we grew up in and for the most part was an accurate portrayal. It was labeled fiction but only a few detailshad been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened. For example, there actually had been a screening of a snuff film in that bedroom in Malibu on a January afternoon, and yes, I had walked out onto the deck overlooking the Pacific where the author tried to console me, assuring me that the screams of the children being tortured were faked, but he was smiling as he said this and I had to turn away. Other examples: my girlfriend had in fact run over a coyote in the canyons below Mulholland, and a Christmas Eve dinner at Chasen's with my family that I had casually complained about to the author was faithfully rendered. And a twelve-year-old girl really had been gang-raped — I was in that room in West Hollywood with the writer, who in the book noted just a vague reluctance on my part and failed to accurately describe how I had actually felt that night — the desire, the shock, how afraid I was of the writer, a blond and isolated boy whom the girl I was dating had halfway fallen in love with. But the writer would never fully return her love because he was too lost in his own passivity to make the connection she needed from him, and so she had turned to me, but by then it was too late, and because the writer resented that she had turned to me I becamethe handsome and dazed narrator, incapable of love or kindness. That's how I became the damaged party boy who wandered through the wreckage, blood streaming from his nose, asking questions that never required answers. That's how I became the boy who never understoodhow anything worked. That's how I became the boy who wouldn't save a friend. That's how I became the boy who couldn't love the girl.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/books/excerpt-imperial-bedrooms.html

The name, pronounced EN-ee-add, is a Greek term for a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology and reflects the firm’s reconfiguration as a collective of nine partners. James Polshek, who has been at the firm for 55 years, said he was comfortable with the change. “This is what has to happen if you’re going to pass the torch in a creative way,” he said in a telephone interview. “That’s what I wanted to do.” The firm also announced the creation of Ennead Lab, a private foundation dedicated to research, education and advocacy. Mr. Polshek, 80, left the partnership five years ago and became design counsel to the office, a title he will retain. “I will continue working,” he said. “I have a lot of years left in me.” What happens to the name if the number of partners grows or decreases? “It’s the name of the moment,” Mr. Polshek said. “Maybe they’ll remove three gods or add two more gods, or whatever.” He added, “Certainly, my name is always going to be associated with this office.

2010-06-24,Jackson Estate Sued Over Song Rights,"A Broadway producer seeking to create a musical from Michael Jackson’s songs is suing the singer’s estate in an effort to force the executors to provide the rights to “Thriller,” “Beat It” and other hit songs and also to bar the estate from licensing song rights to another party for use in a stage show. The lawsuit, filed by Nederlander Presentations last Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, came two months after the Jackson estate announced a deal with Cirque du Soleil, the acrobatic-theater company, to create two shows based on Jackson’s music. Whether the lawsuit is a direct response to the Cirque deal is unclear: James Nederlander Jr., who is pursuing the court action, declined to comment through a spokesman. A lawyer for the Jackson estate, Howard Weitzman, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the Cirque deal had no bearing on the Nederlander musical project because Cirque shows “are not musicals but rather big arena, circuslike spectaculars.” In 2008 Nederlander Presentations signed a contract with a production company of Jackson’s, obtaining exclusive rights through October 2011 to develop a musical based on selected Jackson songs, with an option to extend through October 2013. Mr. Nederlander is also seeking songs that Jackson may have written for the musical; the civil suit does not indicate whether he wrote any such compositions.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/arts/music/24arts-JACKSONESTAT_BRF.html

He has new solo projects on the horizon and I wish him love and success.” Mr. Wilson, who with his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mr. Love and Al Jardine, formed the Beach Boys in 1961, stopped working with the band in the 1980s, and is currently working on new music based on unfinished compositions by George Gershwin.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/arts/music/24arts-WOULDNTITHAV_BRF.html

But things worked out better for Ms. Kemper, who not only isn’t an orphan and didn’t grow up in a foster home, but also has a creative younger sister, Carrie, with whom she is about to write a comic novel planned for 2012. On Wednesday the Three Rivers Press imprint of Crown Publishing said it had acquired the book, tentatively titled “Monday Sessions,” in which Ellie and Carrie Kemper chronicle a fictitious Manhattan psychiatrist named Dr. Amy Rice through her diary entries and patient files. Asked in a telephone interview how long she and Carrie had this project up their sleeves, Ellie Kemper said: “Oh my gosh. Well, we’re not sure. We hope that it ends up coming out of our sleeves.” The Kemper siblings are already used to working together at “The Office,” where Carrie recently joined as a staff writer, and occasionally writes lines that emerge from her sister’s mouth. “It’s a great sense of power over her,” Carrie Kemper said. “If she makes one false move, she’s off the show.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/books/24arts-OFFICEMATEST_BRF.html
2010-06-24,‘Next Fall’ To Close On July 4,"The little-show-that-could couldn’t make it on Broadway after all. The producers of the play “Next Fall” said the production would close at the Helen Hayes Theater on July 4, after 26 previews and 132 regular performances. “Next Fall” cost about $2 million to mount, and one of its lead producers, Richard Willis, said the show would close at a total loss to its producers and investors. A comedy-drama by Geoffrey Nauffts about a gay couple starring Patrick Heusinger, above left, and Patrick Breen, right, wrestling with religious differences and interfering family and friends, “Next Fall” was something of a test case for new plays without well-known cast members trying to make a go of it on Broadway. The play received strong reviews from several theater critics, and enjoyed publicity when Elton John and his partner David Furnish signed on as producer-presenters. (Their names were splashed all over advertising materials.) But in the end the audience did not build. The producers had hoped for recognition at the Tony Awards on June 13, but “Next Fall” lost out to another new play, “Red,” for best play and best director of the play, the two categories in which it drew nominations.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/theater/24arts-NEXTFALLTOCL_BRF.html

2010-06-25,South Street Seaport to Relocate Two Concerts,"In response to reports that some concerts at South Street Seaport had been canceled because of the melee at a free Drake show there last week, the seaport and Paper magazine, which presented the event, said the concerts would still take place, but not at the seaport. “Since it was demonstrated that the escalating popularity of the scheduled artists can result in crowds that exceed even the safe capacity of the Pier 17 concert stage, both Paper magazine and the South Street Seaport have decided that the remaining events of the Sounds Like Paper concert series will be relocated,” a seaport spokesman said in a statement, which was confirmed by Paper. In a letter to Community Board No. 1 of Manhattan last week, General Growth Properties, which owns the seaport, had said the two remaining shows, by the pop singer Kesha, above right, and the band Ratatat, would be canceled. The Seaport’s outdoor concert space has a capacity of about 10,000, but according to some reports, as many as 25,000 people turned out for the Drake concert on June 15. It was not clear whether a new stage had been found, or whether the seaport would be involved. Kesha, whose song “Tik Tok” is one of the year’s biggest hits, had been booked for a free Seaport concert in August, but a spokeswoman at her record label, RCA, said Thursday that she had not yet been informed about a new date or location.

Along the way, he told me a story about the perils of humility. “I had a short and rather valuable lesson,” Mitchell said after a morning on the beach, “one of these warnings that the universe gives you on a platter sometimes. I’d done an event in New Zealand at a very large auditorium, hundreds of people, and I was kind of pleased with it; it had gone well. A woman came up to me afterwards, a medievalist at the university there, and she said, ‘Have you heard of the humility topos?’ I said no. She explained that, in the medieval era, humility was seen as a great virtue. The humility topos was used for these abbots — you can think of a good one in Eco’s ‘Name of the Rose’ — who were actually monsters of arrogance, but were always banging on about how humble they were — ‘Just like our lord Jesus Christ. We serve him in humility’ — when they were the least humble people you can find in history. Some even became pope.

Neither the book nor the movie is named, but titles aren’t necessary, for here are the old familiar names: Blair, Julian, Trent — and Clay, the narrator of that novel and this one, “Imperial Bedrooms,” which takes up their stories a quarter of a century on. So there’s a neat, postmodern, self-­referential beginning, with Clay, the cool observer of his own actions and feelings — or lack of them — observing himself being observed, an acknowledgment that his version of the story may be only one of many.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/books/review/Wagner-t.html

From Lily Bart to Nick Carraway, the road to hell is paved with grand ambitions. And, more recently, with crazy mortgages.

If the last century crashed into the forces of urbanization, fragmentation and world war, this one seems to be on an endless, murmuring skid. Things are . . . O.K. You know. They’re O.K. Click, click. There’s so much time, at least for some people, but it’s filled with doubts about what, exactly, to do.

I suspect that some of the journalists who participated in the e-mail list (I’m thinking of figures who write for mainstream outlets like Time and Newsweek and The New Yorker, in particular) would have never dreamed of joining a semi-secret liberal forum a decade ago: That would have seemed too partisan, too compromising, too biased.

In 2006, the two tan-brick apartment houses were designated a landmark, even though the owners had re-clad them in reddish-pink stucco, drastically changing their appearance. “The two buildings clearly have a historical significance that justifies their designation as landmarks,” the court said in its decision. City Councilwoman Jessica Lappin, who represents parts of the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island and was formerly chairwoman of the council’s landmarks committee, said: “I commend the court for making the right decision. Now the owner should restore these buildings to their former state and stop fighting a losing and wrongheaded battle with the community. The ugly pink stucco has to go.” Brian Maddox, a spokesman for the Stahl York Avenue, which owns the property, said, “We are weighing all legal options, including an appeal, which will permit us to pursue our interest in developing the property.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/arts/design/26arts-COURTUPHOLDS_BRF.html

From 1929 to 1939, Lucie and Walter Rosen cobbled together a large country house at Caramoor, their 90-acre estate here, made up of rooms in disparate styles (from palaces and other buildings) that they acquired in Europe. When the house was finished, the Rosens began presenting concerts in their music room, and in 1946 they opened Caramoor to the public as a performing-arts center.

A similar glove sold for $350,000 in November at an auction by Julien’s in New York.

Live, the popular performance series that brings leading dance, music and theater companies to Los Angeles each year, has eliminated its prestigious international theater festival from the 2010-11 schedule because of budget cuts, The Los Angeles Times reported. The performance series’s annual budget, around $8 million, has been suffering in recent years because of falling attendance and reduced fund-raising, and the number of events this year has diminished to 47 from 85 in the 2009-10 season. David Sefton, U.C.L.A. Live’s artistic director for almost a decade, resigned in May after learning about plans for “a major rethinking and restructuring” of the series. “It was not going to be the program I was originally brought in to run,” Mr. Sefton told The Times in May. “It’s not appropriate for me, and my response was to resign,” he said. In past seasons the theater festival has presented innovative productions and acclaimed actors, including the theater and opera director Lenka Udovicki’s staging of “Medea,” starring Annette Bening; Ian McKellen in “King Lear,” directed by Trevor Nunn; and the National Theater of Scotland’s widely praised “Black Watch.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/theater/28arts-UCLALIVECUTS_BRF.html

Ms. Winfrey’s forthcoming cable channel, OWN, has been holding online and in-person casting calls for “Your OWN Show: Oprah’s Search for the Next TV Star,” a reality show that will have its premiere next year. Last week the search was tainted by allegations from fans of the top two online candidates, Zach Anner and Phyllis Wick-Turner, that the other side had stuffed the online ballot box. Some even suggested that Ms. Winfrey was behind it. The allegations, picked up by the news media, prompted a channel spokesperson to say in a statement that no “contestant has been favored in this competition,” but that an investigation would be undertaken and that all votes would be verified twice. The five most popular online contestants will go before a casting director, but only one is guaranteed a spot on the reality show, though OWN could choose to add more than one. A total of 10 in-person and online contestants will vie for a spot; eventually the show’s winner will be hired by OWN.

Not to be omitted from the global Jackson remembrances, more than 900 prisoners at Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center assembled on Saturday to dance to Jackson’s songs, including “They Don’t Really Care About Us,” “Billie Jean” and, of course, “Thriller,” Agence France-Presse reported. Judge Geraldine Faith Econg, who led a delegation of jurists to the two-hour event, told Agence France-Presse: “This will set an example to other rehabilitation centers in the country. It will also give people a different view of the inmates.” Mils Bonnen, a teacher from Denmark who was among the 500 visitors who came to watch the performance by convicted murderers, rapists and drug dealers, told the news agency: “It was a wonderful presentation. I was very impressed. Their concentration was really there, and they were really serious about their dance.” The original “Thriller” Web video has been watched more than 42 million times on YouTube alone.

The BET Awards on Sunday night certainly gave Mr. Brown, above, the tarnished R&B singer, a prominent platform to demonstrate as emotionally  and, at times, theatrically  as possible that he’s ready for the forgiveness of his audience. Last summer Mr. Brown was sentenced to six months of community labor and five years of probation after pleading guilty to felonious assault on the pop star Rihanna, an incident that seemed to leave his career in tatters. But at the BET Awards, which were held in Los Angeles, Mr. Brown took center stage as part of a tribute to Michael Jackson. During his performance of “Man in the Mirror” Mr. Brown frequently became choked up and at one point fell to his knees. Though many viewers accused Mr. Brown of usurping what was supposed to be an honor for Mr. Jackson, Mr. Brown had the last word when he was announced as the surprise winner of BET’s Fandemonium award, a prize determined by fan votes. “I let you all down before, but I won’t do it again,” Mr. Brown said in his acceptance speech. “I promise you.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/arts/music/29arts-CHRISBROWNEN_BRF.html

The floors meant for a swimming pool, a spa and a wine bar remain cavernous concrete shells.

I’m skeptical …), and because public ignorance is vast and deep enough to account for a good-sized chunk of any apparently-scary fringe opinion.

2010-06-30,From Buildings to Baubles,"At age 102, the renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer is still working — and still inspiring. Specifically, he inspired one of his countrymen — Roberto Stern, the president and creative director of the jeweler H. Stern — to bring out a collection of jewelry that was inspired by the maestro’s sketches of buildings (including one of Brasilia, Niemeyer’s masterpiece), flowers and even the female form. The H. Stern Collection by Oscar Niemeyer, which was created in collaboration with the architect, captures the sketches’ light, flowing lines and their general joie de vivre. Niemeyer’s sketch for the exuberantly-curved roof of a church in Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, for example, was translated into a pair of white gold and diamond earrings. An almost childlike drawing of a flower became a graceful, delicate bracelet made of what seems like a single, slender ribbon of yellow gold. The jeweler is known for its creative collaborations, like those with Diane von Furstenberg, the Campana brothers and even Disney (on the surreal-luxe “Alice in Wonderland” collection). But was Niemeyer surprised by Roberto Stern’s request to turn his architectural sketches into rings and necklaces? Not at all. Stern recalled that the architect said simply, “I want to make beautiful things.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/from-buildings-to-baubles/

2010-06-30,Stolen Caravaggio Is Recovered,"A Caravaggio painting considered to be the most valuable work of art in Ukraine was recovered in Germany, two years after it was stolen from a museum in Odessa, Reuters reported. The painting, below, called “The Taking of Christ” or “The Kiss of Judas,” was made by Caravaggio in the early 17th century, and depicts Jesus and his apostles John and Judas as they are being separated by soldiers. It had belonged to a Russian ambassador to France and a Russian prince before it was turned over to the Odessa museum, where it was stolen in 2008. On Tuesday Anatoly Mogylyov, the interior minister of Ukraine, said in a briefing that the Ukrainian and German police had recovered the painting and detained members of a gang that focuses on high-value thefts who had tried to sell the work in Berlin.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/arts/design/30arts-STOLENCARAVA_BRF.html

On Monday night, Bloomberg News reported, members of a protest group emptied BP-labeled cans containing a slick material in front of the party’s entrance and covered the spillage with bird feathers. Other protesters poured out cans of the same material in the museum’s main hall while a separate group dressed in black picketed the event.

2010-06-30,Poof! ‘Jeannie’ Memoir To Appear Next Year,"For the five seasons that she starred on the classic television comedy “I Dream of Jeannie,” Barbara Eden could conjure up anything from valuable artwork to an elephant with a nod and a blink. So why did it take her four decades since the series ended its run to write a memoir about her life and career? “Quite frankly, it scared the dickens out of me,” Ms. Eden said in a telephone interview. “I was quite frightened of doing this. I’ve been asked several times, and it’s daunting to talk about yourself. It gets to the soft spots inside you.” On Tuesday the Crown Archetype imprint of Random House’s Crown Publishing division said that it would release a memoir by Ms. Eden, called “Jeannie Out of the Bottle,” in the spring of 2011. As its title implies, the book will have its share to say about “I Dream of Jeannie,” in which Ms. Eden played the mystically empowered title character from 1965 to 1970. “She’ll have a big voice in this story,” Ms. Eden said, “but a lot went on before Jeannie.” Ms. Eden, who is working with a collaborator, Wendy Leigh, on the memoir, said they had a few more soul-baring sessions planned before the manuscript is complete. “I’ll just hold my nose and jump in,” Ms. Eden said.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/books/30arts-POOFJEANNIEM_BRF.html

You see, I don’t listen to music. O.K., a little bit when jogging, but it’s the same 10 songs in the same order that I’ve listened to on various machines (from yellow sports Walkman, to skipping CD-player, to minidisc player, to Zune — yes, Zune — to iPods) for years.  At the gym I watch reality television (like every  writer, I love “Hoarders”). At home, I listen to NPR.  So there’s no way I can impress with obscure Laplandic bands or neologistic sub-genres. Instead, I’d like to share some songs I came across as I was doing research for “Stations West,” my novel about Jewish immigrants in Oklahoma in the 19th century. One of the subplots surrounds the construction and subsequent development of the intercontinental railroad.  The railroad was the original information superhighway, bringing mail and newspapers, other cultures and foods to the remote West; railroad songs are the viral videos of the 19th century.

But a dispute over the 25th-anniversary celebrations of that musical has pitted its original co-director Trevor Nunn against its producer Cameron Mackintosh, The Telegraph of London reported. In an interview with The Telegraph, Mr. Nunn, who with John Caird directed the original Royal Shakespeare Company production of “Les Misérables,” which opened at the Barbican Theater in London in 1985, said he and his original collaborators “felt betrayed” by Mr. Mackintosh’s hiring of new directors for a revival of the show planned at the Barbican for September. “We were not asked,” said Mr. Nunn, whose Broadway credits include the current revival of “A Little Night Music.” “In fact, we knew nothing of it.” Mr. Mackintosh, who brought in the directors James Powell and Laurence Conner to handle the anniversary revival of “Les Misérables,” said in a statement that he was “saddened by Nunn’s inaccurate and ungracious remarks.” “I believe that each new generation has to be able to put its own stamp on great material,” Mr. Mackintosh said in the statement.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/theater/01arts-NUNNANDMACKI_BRF.html

That’s about to change. On Wednesday MCC Theater said he would make his proper stage debut in its coming production of “The Break of Noon,” a new play by Neil LaBute. Mr. Duchovny, right, said in a phone interview he has previously acted “Off, off, off, off  as many offs as you can put in front of Broadway.” He added, “I’ve never done anything close to this scale.” “The Break of Noon” is described in a news release as centering on a character called John Smith (Mr. Duchovny) who “amidst the chaos and horror of the worst office shooting in American history, sees the face of God,” setting off a “maelstrom of disbelief among everyone he knows.” The play, which will be directed by Jo Bonney, is to begin performances at the Lucille Lortel Theater on Oct. 28.

At the very least the enormous opening puts “Eclipse” on track to match “New Moon,” which sold about $710 million at the global box office. While the studio behind the series, Summit Entertainment, has been cautious about predicting how “Eclipse” will perform, the hope is that its summer slot will generate repeat business dwarfing that of its predecessors. Filmed at a cost of $68 million, “Eclipse” will be shown in more than 4,400 theaters in North America.
