But after five weeks of observing the mayor’s commuting habits, a team of New York Times reporters has concluded that the mayor’s routine is somewhat unusual, Michael M. Grynbaum reports. When he does take the subway to work — at least several times a week — he is picked up by two S.U.V.’s and driven from his town house on 79th Street to the subway station at 59th Street, where he catches the express train (the No. 4 or No. 5 subway line) to City Hall. “Where would you drive from in Manhattan to a subway station?” an M.T.A. spokesman, Jeremy Soffin, said when told about the routine. “That would be pretty crazy.”",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/the-mayors-unusual-commute-tax-evasion-convictions-and-more/

It was a perennial political question: Did image live up to reality?The last time I’d been conscious at that hour involved finishing up a term paper from the night before.

2007-08-02,A Leg Up on Running Injuries,"As the rush of fall road-running races nears, one challenge is to reach the starting line without first joining the large majority of runners -- as many as 80 percent -- who suffer a leg injury each year. A review of injury studies about lower-body injuries among runners, published in the current issue of The British Journal of Sports Medicine, provides some explanation for what causes so many injuries. It might not be everything you’d expect. Those most likely to be injured, the review found, include people who’ve been injured before; are too obsessive, running for a year or more without a break; or are men taller than 5-foot-6. (No study in the review looked at the issue of women's height.) Runners with a relatively high body mass appear to somehow avoid foot injury -- perhaps, the authors speculated, because Clydesdales, in general, run less. Surprisingly, some factors didn’t contribute to injury risk, including having legs of different length, using alcohol, or running after dark, when people may be more prone to misstep. The one element that was found to prevent running injuries most consistently was increasing mileage gradually, to a maximum of about 40 miles per week.

After the installation was mentioned in an article published in The International Herald Tribune on July 20 (and in The New York Times on July 25) Mr. Mortara wrote to the National Arts Council in Singapore to declare that Ms. Lu’s work, identified by the title “X,” above, was “a substantively direct copy of a copyrighted piece” that he created in 2002 and called “Memories Revisited.” In it he used ink to write memories from his life on pieces of toilet paper before burning them over a candle. In “X” Ms. Lu wrote the names of former friends, colleagues and lovers on toilet paper using apple juice so that the names would appear briefly when exposed to the heat of the candle. Mr. Mortara said a “coincidence” was “impossible,” because he and Ms. Lu knew each other and they had performed on the same night at a show in San Francisco in 2003. After questioning by Heman Chong, curator of the Singapore show, Ms. Lu said that she had been inspired by Mr. Mortara’s work and that she and he had agreed to retitle her installation “X (After ‘Memories Revisited’ by Jason Mortara)” and to share the small grant she had received for her work. She said: “It had not occurred to me before this that Mr. Mortara would consider ‘X’ a copyright infringement of his work, as artists often influence each other, but I saw it as a grave insensitivity and carelessness on my part. I apologized to Mr. Mortara for my poor judgment, and suggested crediting him” with the new title.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/arts/design/02arts-ARTWORKPULLE_BRF.html

2007-08-02,O. J. Simpson Blames His Ghost," O. J. Simpson has distanced himself from the description of the 1994 slaying of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman in his aborted book “If I Did It,” Reuters reported. In an interview streamed live on Tuesday by the Web site Market News First (www.MN1.com) Mr. Simpson, who was acquitted of criminal charges in the case but found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial, said the book was composed by an unidentified ghostwriter and that he reluctantly assented to a chapter about the night of the crime as told by him only after the publishers agreed to label it hypothetical. Mr. Simpson said he allowed the author to ask him questions, but was otherwise passive in describing the killings. “I read what he wrote, and I saw all of these major holes, all of these impossible things,” Mr. Simpson said. “All of these other parts of the book I would correct, but I told myself, ‘If I correct this, there are going to be people out there that say, “Oh, look how accurate this is,” ’ Right?” Rights to the book, dropped by HarperCollins after a public outcry, have been awarded to the Goldman family in payment of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment against Mr. Simpson. He criticized them, The Associated Press reported, saying, “I find it sort of hypocritical that they talked everybody in America to boycott the book: it was ‘immoral,’ it was ‘blood money.’ But now we see it wasn’t ‘blood money’ if they got the money.” David Cook, a lawyer for the Goldman family, said: “Mr. Simpson himself has placed us in this horrific setting of seeking to liquidate this asset. His comments are beyond redemption.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/arts/02arts-OJSIMPSONBLA_BRF.html

William Neuman describes the reports as a “broad indictment” of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s safety practices.The report on Mr. Franklin’s death was particularly scathing, asserting that “organizational culture was such that critical safety rules were not practiced in day-to-day operations.” The workers failed to cover up the electrified third rail or set up warning lights, and a supervisor who had promised to act as a flagman, watching for trains, left his post. Moments later, Mr. Franklin was dragged under a train and killed, and his co-worker was seriously injured after he was pinned between the train and a wall [].",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/track-worker-deaths-giuliani-and-fox-florida-abuse-case-and-more/

The committee, led by Brad Sewell of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that many factors contribute to the disappearance: changing currents, sea level rise and overdevelopment around the fringes of the bay.

Ms. Wilson, along with her publisher, Simon & Schuster, filed a lawsuit in late May in New York seeking to stop the C.I.A. from interfering with publication of the book, “Fair Game,” right. In their suit they argued that since the dates of Ms. Wilson’s C.I.A. service have been made public, she should be able to use them in her memoir. But Judge Barbara Jones ruled that the dates were never declassified, and said that a letter from the C.I.A., which neither Ms. Wilson nor her publisher has seen, convinced her that there were national security reasons for keeping the dates out of the book. A spokesman for the publisher said that it was “disappointed in the court’s ruling, which we believe runs counter to the First Amendment, sets a dangerous precedent and creates an unreasonable standard by which the government can disappear public information and rewrite history.” He added that no decision had been made about whether to appeal the ruling, but that Simon & Schuster still expected to release the book this fall.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/books/04art-VALERIEPLAME_BRF.html

2007-08-06,The Van Gogh That Wasnt,"Experts have determined that “Head of a Man,” a painting attributed to van Gogh for more than 70 years, is a fake, probably painted by one of van Gogh’s peers, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Gerard Vaughan, the director of the National Gallery of Victoria, in Australia, said that a team at the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam had found that the painting differed stylistically from the artist’s other works and was mostly likely painted by one of his contemporaries. The painting was taken to Australia in 1939 by Keith Murdoch, father of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The museum bought it in 1940 for about $3,500. “It was purchased as a van Gogh work, and had been accepted as a van Gogh for more than a decade” before the purchase, Mr. Vaughan said in a statement. The painting’s authenticity was first called into question last August, when it was on display at the Dean Gallery in Edinburgh. Critics said the work, dated 1886, was of a different style than other van Gogh paintings of the same period and was not mentioned in any of the artist’s letters. When the Edinburgh show closed, the National Gallery of Victoria sent the painting to the van Gogh Museum for analysis. “It is very important to make the point that it’s not a forgery,” Mr. Vaughan told reporters. “There is no evidence to suggest that someone produced this picture ... to pass it off as a work by van Gogh.” When it was thought to be a van Gogh, the painting had been valued at about $21 million.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04art-THEVANGOGHTH_BRF.html

As a kind of belated birthday present, his new novel, “The Tin Roof Blowdown,” is receiving some of the best reviews of his career — the book enters the fiction list this week at No. 4. Burke has long written about Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, and in “The Tin Roof Blowdown” he pokes around in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrinia. In the book, his stalwart hero, Detective Dave Robicheaux, is among the relief workers looking for survivors in the flood. The message boards on Burke’s Web site are full of posts arguing that the book “should be required reading for the boys and girls in Washington, D.C.” Writing in The Washington Post, the thriller critic Patrick Anderson called Burke’s novel “the best fictional portrait of Katrina that we have so far.” But Anderson urged readers to keep Burke’s achievement in perspective: “There’s a bigger, better novel, perhaps by some as-yet-unknown Robert Penn Warren, waiting to be written about this American tragedy.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/05tbr.html

2007-08-06,Fiction Chronicle ,"DEVILS IN THE SUGAR SHOP. By Timothy Schaffert. (Unbridled, paper, $14.95.) Think “Sex and the City.” Now make the city ... Omaha. The circle of women in this sprightly and eager-to-please novel — an artist, a writer, a hostess of sex-toy parties and a pair of twins who own a bookstore — are wise and worldly, enjoying the gentrification campaign that has given them their own ersatz Manhattan. Ashley, a writer of sexy novels that don’t sell very well, conducts erotica-writing workshops and fights valiantly against the genre’s clichés, “forbidding any character’s mouth from forming into ‘a perfect O’ of pleasure or surprise or delight, or into an O of anything, for that matter.” With her best friends — Viv, the artist, and Deedee, who has found great success selling, Tupperware-style, what used to be called “marital aids” — Ashley has made her little slice of redeveloped downtown Omaha into a swanky scene that meets chick lit’s exacting locational criteria. But its setting aside, can a novel still be called chick lit if (a) it’s written by a guy, and (b) most of the chicks in question are in their late 30s to early 40s and not especially interested in shoes? When the characters spend as much time as these do searching for love, sipping cocktails and seeking comfort in one another’s company, the answer is yes, though Schaffert’s version of it is a good deal smarter and funnier than most of the disposable volumes cluttering up this genre’s walk-in closet.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/Turrentine-t.html

There are a few billionaires, working hard to give their wealth away, and there are even some Christian evangelicals, who have decided the earth is not theirs to trash, but the movement is mostly about shared beliefs, even if those beliefs are unproclaimed. “Life is the most fundamental human right,” Hawken writes, “and all of the movements within the movement are dedicated to creating the conditions for life, conditions that include livelihood, food, security, peace, a stable environment and freedom from external tyranny.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/Sullivan-t.html

They vowed to pass a local ordinance that would penalize landlords that rented to illegal aliens and businesses that hired them. They also pledged to make English the official language of the village, which would mean discontinuing the practice of printing various notices — including building-code violations and the monthly newsletter — in both English and Spanish. The third candidate on their slate also won, giving them a majority on the board. Sigwalt and Humpfer considered their election a mandate. Indeed, many in this village consider them heroes.

His latest book, “Presidential Courage,” recently spent nine weeks on the best-seller list. Asked how George W. Bush fits his idea of presidential courage, Beschloss observed: “Bush partisans will insist that the president was brave to go to war in Iraq because the outcome of his presidency would depend on whether or not America won. But presidential courage — as I define it in the book — is when a president risks his popularity for an important cause for which Americans of the future are grateful. At the moment, it’s sadly hard to imagine that future Americans will feel that way about the Iraq war.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/Upfront-t.html

2007-08-06,The Independent,"One of the fascinating side streets in American film is the history of “race pictures,” celluloid productions by black artists for black audiences during those decades when Jim Crow laws enforced segregation. The mainstay of race pictures was Oscar Micheaux (1884-1951), an intrepid filmmaker-novelist-entrepreneur whose career spanned four decades and who made more than 40 movies. Not surprisingly, given that he opened doors for future black filmmakers and collaborated with important figures like Paul Robeson and the novelist Charles Chesnutt, a whole scholarly industry has grown up around Micheaux. Now Patrick McGilligan, biographer of Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and George Cukor, has synthesized the advance work of these scholars and written “Oscar Micheaux,” a popular life of this colorful figure.

2007-08-06,Lost in Tehran,"A memorable title will surely attract readers, but when a book becomes a classic, it’s hard to say whether the title has been part of its canonization or has merely become retroactively canonical. Would “Trimalchio in West Egg,” one of Fitzgerald’s initial choices, have in time accrued the same force as “The Great Gatsby”? “The Septembers of Shiraz,” poignant once you’ve read this first novel by Dalia Sofer, is, on its own, a title at once overly poetic and misleading. An American reader might be forgiven for thinking Sofer has written a romance set in the Napa Valley, “Sideways” with Vaseline on the lens. And that would be a great shame because “The Septembers of Shiraz” is a remarkable debut: the richly evocative, powerfully affecting depiction of a prosperous Jewish family in Tehran shortly after the revolution. In this fickle literary world, it’s impossible to predict whether Sofer’s novel will become a classic, but it certainly stands a chance.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/05mess.html

What seems to govern the fate of Tom and his kin over the 40-some years the story blithely spans might more accurately be described as pure, out-of-the-blue coincidence. One of his daughters calls it providence; another isn’t so sure. Readers could be similarly split: some delighting in the ingenuity of Hagen’s plotting, others finding its ease and godlike capriciousness a little (or more than a little) suspect. “Tom Bedlam” is the sort of novel that tends to be described, not always admiringly, as old-fashioned. But it’s odder, and better, than that: a strange convergence of the English novel’s estimable past and our own, rather less confident, present.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/05raff2.html

2007-08-06,‘Down the Nile’," ON THE DAY that I hoped to buy a rowboat in Luxor, Egypt, I was awakened, as I had been every morning in Luxor, by a Koranic antiphony drifting from the Islamic boys' school next door to my hotel. With all the zeal of a Baptist preacher's, a young boy's amplified voice shrieked repeatedly in Arabic, ""There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his witness!"" and a shrill chorus of his schoolmates howled the words back at him. I got out of bed and went to the window - at 7:00 a.m. the glass was already warm as an infant's forehead - and discovered that during the night many colorful cloth banners had been strung above the corniche, Luxor's Nilefront boulevard. In hand-fashioned Arabic characters, the banners read, ""Welcome Mister President of the Government, Muhammad Hosni Mubarak, the Leader of Our Victorious and Progressive Destiny."" Scores of teenage Egyptian soldiers in black uniforms, woolen berets, and white plastic spats lined the avenue in the ninety-eight-degree heat, more or less at attention, rifles at their sides, evidently awaiting the president's arrival. Profiting from a police barricade, the usually hectic street was, for once, mercifully quiet. Across the glittering ribbon of the Nile, the Temple of Hatshepsut and the Valley of the Kings lay blanketed in the pink morning light.

For me as a listener, that approach worked so well that in the years since I have tried to employ it myself at every opportunity. A recent conversation with a neuroscientist friend shed some light on why this device is often so effective. Different parts of the brain, it seems, specialize in thinking about different things. When we are confronted with a question in a specific domain, blood flows to the relevant part of the brain, priming it to think more effectively about the related ideas to follow.

Without experience to cloud one’s judgment or information to slow one’s thinking, the passage from ignorance of a writer’s work to a vague acquaintance with its main elements — courtesy, say, of an essay or a review executed by someone better versed — can be a stimulating imaginative exercise.

Simpson’s accounts of its creation and content, including the hypothetical description of the slaying of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, Reuters reported. The ghostwriter, Pablo Fenjves, disputed Mr. Simpson’s characterization of himself as a mostly passive participant in the composition of the chapter that depicts him holding a bloody knife at the scene of the crime. “The whole book, the whole idea for a book, originated with O. J. Simpson and a couple of his handlers,” Mr. Fenjves said. “O. J. read the book, his book, several times. I made every change he asked for, and he signed off on it.” In an Internet interview last week Mr. Simpson said he had been approached by publishers at HarperCollins about doing the book and had reluctantly consented to a chapter about the night of the crime as told by him only after they had agreed to label it hypothetical. Mr. Fenjves said: “I find it completely unnecessary to defend myself against this man. All I can say is that if there are errors in the book, it’s because O. J. didn’t correct them, or worse, he fed them to me.” Amid public outrage, publication of the book was canceled last year. Rights to it were awarded last week to Mr. Goldman’s relatives to satisfy a $33.5 million judgment they won against Mr. Simpson in a civil trial after he was acquitted of the slayings in a criminal case.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/books/06arts-GHOSTWRITERD_BRF.html

The painting was found below the paint surface of van Gogh’s “Ravine,” owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The news, announced by that museum and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, came as the National Gallery of Victoria, in Australia, was reporting that a team at the Van Gogh Museum had determined that “Head of Man,” attributed to van Gogh for more than 70 years, was probably executed by one of his peers. The painting beneath “Ravine” was discovered during a technical examination by Meta Chavannes, a Museum of Fine Arts conservator. It was most likely painted in June 1889, when van Gogh was at the asylum of St.-Paul-de-Mausole and was reused as a support for “Ravine” a few months later. Louis van Tilborgh, the van Gogh research curator at the Van Gogh Museum, related it to “Wild Vegetation,” a drawing van Gogh sent his brother Theo in mid-1889. Scholars have suggested that the drawing was one of about a dozen copies of paintings that van Gogh sent to Theo at that time, but until now, no one was aware of a painting upon which this drawing could have been based.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/arts/design/06arts-LOSTVANGOGHI_BRF.html

Ms. Kainja told the newspaper, “We have already contacted Madonna that someone else and not Kilembe will come to assess her because we feel Mr. Kilembe personalized the whole issue when other people can go.” Mr. Kilembe dismissed suggestions that he had personally asked Madonna for airfare. The High Court appointed him to travel to Britain and was to rely on his testimony in deciding if Madonna and her husband, the filmmaker Guy Ritchie, should be allowed to adopt the child. Madonna took the motherless boy, David Banda, in October after his father, Yohane Banda, placed him in an orphanage. Mr. Kilembe said, “What this means is that the whole adoption process may crumble and David sent back to his village.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/arts/06arts-MADONNASADOP_BRF.html

Uncertainty also surrounds the continuation of government financing after the current allocation ends in February. The archive was established by the Swedish Film Institute in collaboration with the Royal Dramatic Theater, Swedish Television and Svensk, a producer and distributor. Support could come from the Bonnier family, whose media holdings in Sweden include television and newspapers. “We will see what we can do to save the archives,” a representative of the family said. “It is important not only to us; it is important for filmmakers, for scholars and for the Swedish culture that this heritage is not destroyed or wasted.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/movies/07arts-INGMARBERGMA_BRF.html

Arnold Schwarzenegger, after many legislators argued that violent video games could cause psychological harm and incite aggressive behavior in minors.

Last year Robert L. Geltzer, the court-appointed trustee for Mr. Giacchetto’s bankrupt company, Cassandra Group, unearthed a book deal in which Mr. Giacchetto was to split the proceeds with Emily White, his biographer. Mr. Geltzer sued, and in a settlement to be filed with bankruptcy court today, Mr. Giacchetto, 44, has turned over his stake in her book, “You Will Make Money in Your Sleep: The Story of Dana Giacchetto, Financial Adviser to the Stars,” and the rights to his life story in any film or television production to satisfy claims against Cassandra Group. Whether the settlement will raise much money is doubtful.

2007-08-13,A Pastor Finds a Way to Serve Two Disparate Flocks,"CAMPBELLSPORT, WIS. The brick church, more than a century old, stands at the junction of two county roads tracing the glacial hills of southeastern Wisconsin. In the field across the way, the summer corn stretches eight feet from root to tassel. This being a Sunday morning, the Rev. Daniel Schultz greets the faithful on the front steps as they arrive for 9 a.m. worship at the Salem United Church of Christ. Pastor Dan, as he prefers to be known, is the only man in the congregation wearing a coat and tie. Over the next hour, he leads the 70 worshipers in a round of ""Happy Birthday"" for Jim Maul, a longtime member. He invites a half-dozen children to the pulpit, where he crouches among them to teach them to recite ""The Lord's Prayer."" In the part of the service designated for ""sharing joys and concerns,"" he listens as people rise in the pews to tell of a relative's surgery, a brother's recovery from a liver transplant. Here is ministry at its most venerable, ministry at its most tender and intimate and finely grained. And it comes from a minister with a strikingly unlikely double-life, one part as the small-town preacher in a socially conservative spot of the Midwest, the other as an abrasive and confrontational voice of the religious left in the blogosphere. Exactly one week after Mr. Schultz presided over Sunday worship at his home church here, he gave a sermon in the vast arena of the McCormick Convention Center in Chicago. Instead of the farmers, factory workers and tradesmen who typify his regular congregation, the audience for his denunciation of the Iraq war consisted of the self-proclaimed ""netroots"" attending Yearly Kos, the annual political and media convention organized by the Daily Kos Web site. For three years, Mr. Schultz has supplied the voice of religion for Daily Kos, an epicenter of left-liberal activity with an otherwise fiercely secular bent. In 2004, Mr. Schultz began fielding prayer requests every Sunday night as part of a Daily Kos feature called ""Brothers and Sisters."" A year later, Daily Kos's founder, Markos Moulitsas, let Mr. Schultz spin off a formally connected online community, Street Prophets. In 4.3 million page views since then, Mr. Schultz's readers have found comparatively little balm in Gilead. True to the take-no-prisoners style of blogosphere discourse, Street Prophets traffics more in calumny and condemnation, though with an extremely learned theological intelligence behind it. ""If Conservative Christians are looking for salvation,"" Mr. Schultz wrote in one characteristic post, ""they ought to start looking to save themselves from themselves. They have much to repent for, like the rest of us. But unlike the rest of us, they have a unique level of judgmentalism and separation to get out of their system."" Besides decrying the religious right on issues like gay rights, abortion and intelligent design, Mr. Schultz has also disparaged even seeming allies like Jim Wallis, probably the most prominent liberal among the evangelical Christian clergy. Mr. Schultz has reviled Mr. Wallis's ""patronizing lectures."" Somehow this balancing act seems to work, meeting the needs of two wildly disparate flocks and reconciling Mr. Schultz to himself. As someone who suffers from, and is medicated for, bipolar disorder, Mr. Schultz has, of necessity, become an expert on reckoning with extremes. ""There's a part of me that's been angry since I was a kid,"" Mr. Schultz, 39, said in an interview. ""Part of that is my illness, and part of it is a deep sense that the world isn't the place it was meant to be. I had to find a productive place to put that anger or it would swallow me whole. And part of my spiritual journey has been to claim that anger as spiritual."" In choosing the blogosphere as his pulpit, Mr. Schultz forms part of a trend in which liberal members of the clergy are using the Internet the way Christian conservatives used cable television and talk radio in earlier decades. Diane Winston, a professor of religion and media at the University of Southern California, points to such similar figures online as Mr. Wallis, Rabbi Michael Lerner at Tikkun, the Rev. Tim Simpson at PublicTheologian and Rachel Barenblat at Velveteen Rabbi. ""The blogosphere offers a new way to organize religious people into political communities,"" Ms. Winston wrote in an e-mail message. ""For better or worse, it plays to traditional strengths and weaknesses of progressives."" She continued, ""It's not a political movement like the religious right and there's no inkling it could be. On the other hand, the Web seems the ideal medium for the wide-ranging discussions, coalition-building and open-ended organizing that characterizes the left."" In the more prosaic part of Mr. Schultz's life, Salem United Church of Christ sought him out last year for eminently practical reasons. The congregation had released its previous pastor. Struggling to survive with about 80 active members, the church was limping along with guest preachers on a weekly basis. Mr. Schultz embodied both familiarity and new vigor. He was a ""P.K."" - a preacher's kid - who had grown up in his father's church 80 miles away in Madison. After earning degrees in English and history at the University of Wisconsin, and in the process falling away from religious observance, Mr. Schultz returned to it as he earned a master's degree in divinity from Emory University in Atlanta. He had pastored a church in Georgia and substituted at several congregations in Pennsylvania before being called by Salem. Along the way, Mr. Schultz chose as his theological heroes Reinhold Neibuhr, Martin Buber and Jack Kerouac. What impresses many congregants here far more, though, is the way Mr. Schultz and his wife, Jennifer Milazzo-Schultz, have enacted their faith by taking in two foster children. He has also managed to express his politics without imposing them. ""Over all, we're a fairly conservative congregation, but everybody loves him,"" said Denise Goetsch, a member of the church's governing board. ""Whatever people's personal politics are, they're here because they believe in God. And Dan's been good at making friends with pretty much anybody."" Mr. Schultz's sermon here the week before Yearly Kos offered a prime example of how. Drawing on a passage from I Corinthians, Mr. Schultz preached for social justice while speaking directly to his humble church and its obscure home. ""I believe in the underdog,"" he told the congregation. ""I believe in the lost and the lumpy and the people nobody has ever heard of and the towns that don't quite exist on anybody's maps. I believe that they are where God has chosen to become incarnate."" ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/us/11religion-web.html

And what he found (in an essay called “Boys’ Weeklies”) was an extraordinary level of addiction to the form of story that was set in English boarding schools. Every week, boys (and girls) from the poorer quarters of industrial towns and from the outer edges of the English-speaking Empire would invest some part of their pocket-money to keep up with the adventures of Billy Bunter, Harry Wharton, Bob Cherry, Jack Blake and the other blazer-wearing denizens of Greyfriars and St. Jim’s.

(Even Ralph Waldo Emerson, normally a booster of all things American, dismissed him as a mere “pickle dealer.”) What Vespucci did have, according to Felipe Fernández-Armesto’s wonderfully idiosyncratic and intelligent new biography of the explorer, was a gift for chicanery and self-promotion, along with an aching need to be remembered.

Paulsen’s unnamed narrator has two non-Horatian advantages: a stockbroker and a piece of heavy equipment. Or sort of heavy; it’s an old riding mower given to him by his grandmother as a 12th-birthday present. Though not in the least mechanical-minded, he feels an instant bond with the machine, and almost as soon as he fires it up a neighbor comes by offering to pay 20 bucks for a mowing job. The local lawn care guy, it turns out, has just run off with the wife of a customer, and presumably because he poses less of a sexual threat, Lawn Boy, as we might as well call him, soon has more work than he can handle.

(Picador, $16. ) Building on his 1999 book, “The Lexus and the Olive Tree,” Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, maps the next phase of globalization. What leveled the world’s economic playing field? Friedman cites 10 forces, including the dot-com bubble and bust, which turned China and India into high-tech epicenters of the outsourcing world. “The World Is Flat” considers the great opportunities and threats globalization represents to older industrialized nations, especially the United States. In the Book Review, Fareed Zakaria called Friedman’s metaphor of a flat world “ingenious”: “Its fundamental insight is true and deeply important.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/review/0812bb-paperback.html

Minna and Ada Everleigh sat together in a Pullman Palace car, sipping wine served by porters wearing white jackets and gloves. Velvet curtains framed the windows, and thick rugs absorbed the curved heels of their boots. The sisters checked their reflections in bevel-edged French mirrors,reclined on Marshall Field'smost luxurious bedsheets, ate in a dining car where woodcock and prairie chicken were presented on tables set with Belgian linen and expensive English china. The train, lit entirely by electricity, was fitted with a new contraption - ""vestibules,"" accordion-shaped passageways that connected the cars, shutting out the fumes and wind. The air inside their car hung heavy and whisper quiet, but the sisters were restless, giddy with plans: They would build upon what they had learned as madams in Omaha, Nebraska, and create the finest brothel in history.

It has been a rough eight months for Verdant Power, the company that owns the equipment. Days after the first two turbines were lowered into the water, the East River’s powerful currents sheared off the tips of several blades. New blades — made of a cast aluminum that theoretically would hold up better — replaced the ones that were broken and were also installed on the four other turbines.Together, the turbines are capable of producing about 1,000 kilowatt hours a day of clean electricity.But the East River tides have proved too formidable even for the stronger blades, putting excessive strain on the bolts that hold them to the turbine hubs, so all six turbines have been shut for repairs. A and a video accompany Mr. DePalma’s article; an earlier video, in January, examined how the turbines work.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/stalled-east-river-turbines-a-stronger-ethics-panel-school-translators-and-more/

Pedicab operators will be licensed, and the number of vehicles will be capped at 325. No one is certain how many pedicabs are currently in use, but estimates have placed the number as high as 800 to 1,000.The pedicab industry started in the mid-1990s. The vehicles have become popular as an unconventional way to get around Midtown, but cabbies, bus drivers and police officers have often complained that the vehicles clog the streets. In February, the City Council approved a pedicab regulation bill over objections from some cab owners. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seemed poised to sign the bill in March, but at the last minute, he changed his mind, swayed by arguments that the tiny industry should remain relatively unregulated. Later that month, the mayor vetoed the bill, but in April, the Council voted to override the veto.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/pedicab-owners-protest-pending-regulation/

Coaches will tell you that it’s a white-hot crucible in which young men, through blood rituals of violence and teamwork, learn painful lessons about who they are and what they’re capable of — that is, if they give 110 percent. It is also, if you believe the parents, a vehicle by which these boys’ families and community can share in moments of glory before returning to lives of quiet, dusty desperation.

2007-08-20,Uncle Wiggily in Amherst,"At a very early age Leslie Garis began to be aware that there were disturbing discrepancies between her real-life family and the idealized ones portrayed in the uplifting juvenile fiction written by her grandparents. The fragile but magnetic father whom Garis adored, and whom she depicts memorably in “House of Happy Endings,” was at times strangely remote and distracted, even when he managed to speak the right lines. Her pretty young mother, who once wanted to be an opera singer, often locked herself away in her room with migraines, overwhelmed by the difficulties of coping with three children, an emotionally dependent husband and the magnificent turn-of-the-century house they had moved into when they left metropolitan New York in the late 1940s for Amherst, Mass. Even Garis’s younger brothers seemed troubled and had difficulties in school. But the Garis children had been brought up to believe that “a good person is happy; a happy person is good.” For Leslie to admit her family was unhappy would have constituted a flaw in character. Nonetheless, she became a precociously perceptive observer and eavesdropper. Her favorite spy post was an old dumbwaiter; crouched inside it, between floors, she would try to decode the messages carried by the overheard voices of the adults.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/review/Johnson-t.html

2007-08-20,Fiction Chronicle,"RAVEL. By Jean Echenoz. (New Press, $19.95.) It can’t have been Maurice Ravel’s thrill-seeking behavior that prompted Echenoz to imagine his way into the head of this musical genius. Indeed, given the delicacy with which Echenoz teases out life’s minutiae, perhaps the attraction was precisely Ravel’s quietly uneventful existence. “Leaving the bathtub is sometimes quite annoying,” the opening sentence reads. “First of all, it’s a shame to abandon the soapy lukewarm water, where stray hairs wind around bubbles among the scrubbed-off skin cells, for the chill atmosphere of a poorly heated house.” Yes, this is what everyday life is like for Maurice, as it might be for any Jean or Pierre — how to get a good heating system, a good night’s sleep or good food while on tour in 1920s America. Ravel was a private man, his life never bared before all, and rather than add gratuitous spice, Echenoz puts his enchanting imagination to work exploring the mundane, the curmudgeonly, the quirky: Ravel’s refusal to perform unless he’s wearing his patent-leather shoes (“Street shoes with a conductor’s tails are out of the question”); his exhausting struggles with insomnia (“he who invariably chases sleep until dawn only to snag just some mediocre cut-rate, secondhand variety”); his fondness for machinery and engines (“Boléro” is described as “an orchestral factory without a purpose, a suicide whose weapon is the simple swelling of sound”). This beautifully musical little novel, translated by Linda Coverdale, ends in 1937 at Ravel’s deathbed, where “he leaves no will, no image on film, not a single recording of his voice.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/McCulloch-t.html

Or at least the oldest living screenwriter still working. Which is why, as I watched him recently during an hourlong script meeting with the producer Thom Mount, I grew more and more anxious on his behalf. Mount, a former president of Universal Pictures who also produced the movie “Bull Durham,” among others, was going through the latest draft of Foote’s original screenplay, set in Durham, N.C., Mount’s hometown, giving him detailed notes.

2007-08-20,On the Road Again,"In 1951, Jack Kerouac feverishly pounded out the first draft of “On the Road” in three weeks on a single huge roll of paper. This believe-it-or-not item earns a place on the heroic roster of spontaneous literary combustions — Stendhal writing “The Charterhouse of Parma” in 52 days, for example. It also stands alongside the image of Jackson Pollock — in the series of photographs taken of him by Hans Namuth just a few months before Kerouac’s siege of the typewriter — dripping and flinging and flecking paint on a horizontal canvas, fighting and dancing his work into being. Writing is not usually thought of as excessively physical, which is why some writers feel the need to compensate by racing bulls or whatever, but feeding that 120-foot roll through the typewriter seems like a feat of strength. Most writers merely produce effete works on paper, you might say, but Kerouac went and wrestled with the tree itself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/review/Sante2-t-1.html

Did I really go for midnight drives down by the ruined flour mills with the tape deck blaring Dexter Gordon? Did I really attend a high school costume dance dressed as Jack Kerouac? I know for sure — because proof exists — that the year I graduated I chose this bit of the novel’s last paragraph as my yearbook entry: “And nobody, nobody knows what’s going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn rags of growing old.” By the time I left for college, the book’s spell had begun to fade. Late that summer, a dreamy friend asked me to join him in Landmark Forum, the successor to EST, Werner Erhard’s New Age group seminars. We stood under a streetlight near dawn and argued about it: it had made a real difference to him; to me it seemed a woozy retreat from the world. I had “On the Road” in my bag, as I always did.

Rather, interruptions and mistakes result from one of the fundamental properties of language, its linearity. Because speech is timebound and words can come only one after the other, the way we stall, stumble and start again provides clues to the way we render thought with sound. Indeed, what is stilted, stuttered and slipped on illuminates how we retrieve words from memory, how we plan ahead of speech, how we unite meaning and intonation in real time, and how we acquire language in the first place.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/review/Kenneally-t.html

2007-08-20,‘Balance: In Search of the Lost Sense’,"Aristotle was wrong. Often credited as the first to catalog the human body's primary senses, he neglected to mention one of our most important: the sense of balance, that intricate orchestration of nerve impulses that allows us to dance with gravity. His oversight, however, is understandable. While it's easy to detect the role of the eyes, nose, skin, tongue, and ears, the receptors of balance are hidden from view and don't easily give up their secrets. Because the equilibrium sense is mostly autonomic, working below the level of consciousness, like breathing or the beating of a heart, the great philosopher apparently was unable to sense its subtle operation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/chapters/0819-1st-mccr.html

2007-08-20,"‘Um . . . : Slips, Stumbles, and Verbal Blunders, and What They Mean’"," If the world of verbal blunders were the night sky, the Reverend William Archibald Spooner of Oxford University could play the role of the North Star. Spooner, who was born in 1844, was famous for verbal blundering so incorrigible that his exploits have been immortalized in poems and songs and, most enduringly, by lending his name to a type of slip of the tongue he was unusually prone to make. In the spoonerism, sounds from two words are exchanged or reversed, resulting in a phrase that is inappropriate for the setting. For Spooner, these embarrassments ranged from wild to mild. Toasting Queen Victoria at dinner, Spooner said, ""Give three cheers for our queer old dean,"" and he greeted a group of farmers as ""noble tons of soil."" There was the time he cautioned young missionaries against having ""a half-warmed fish in their hearts."" He described Cambridge in the winter as ""a bloody meek place."" Once Spooner berated a student for ""fighting a liar in the quadrangle."" ""You have hissed all my mystery lectures,"" he reportedly said. ""In fact, you have tasted two whole worms and you must leave Oxford this afternoon by the next town drain."" A spoonerism can also involve the reversal of two words, as in ""Courage to blow the bears of life,"" or, when saying good-bye to someone, ""Must you stay, can't you go?""

Now after more than eighty years that was about to change, and though arguably the entire family was losing a part of its heritage, it was the youngest among them, the children of ""the cousins,"" who seemed to feel most deeply the need to mark the break. So it was that on a December night in 1991 the fifth generation of the Rockefeller family-counting from John D. Rockefeller Sr. and his wife, Laura Celestia (""Cettie"") Spelman Rockefeller, for whom the house had been built-gathered in the dining room of Kykuit for a farewell dinner. ""It was an extraordinary evening where everyone reminisced about their childhood experiences on the estate,"" remarked one person afterward. Someone else recalled walking through the house and gardens, ""just thinking how sad it was that it was changing. It was the end. It wasn't going to be a family house anymore. It was going to be a public place."" ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/chapters/0819-1st-dalz.html

Two young American couples on vacation in the Yucatán are persuaded by a German tourist to join the search for his brother at a Mayan archaeological dig in the jungle. What awaits them quickly turns their journey into a nightmare. “ ‘The Ruins’ is superior horror literature,” Gary Kamiya wrote here.

The next day she flew to New York, where she had a long layover and got a manicure, and then went on to North Carolina to see one of three specialists she would end up consulting about her thumb. Finally, late Monday, she and her boyfriend, the actor Jackie Long, arrived in Los Angeles, only to find that their luggage had gone astray. Exhausted, they went home to Serena's condo (decorated by Venus), where they relaxed until the phone rang with the news that their bags had arrived. They could have waited for the luggage to be delivered, but instead, jet-lagged and sleepy, they got in the car and headed back to the airport.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/sports/playmagazine/0819play-serena.html

More PhotosThousands of spectators turned out for the festivities surrounding the 57th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance on the Monterey Peninsula of California, where some of the rarest vehicles in the world were on display and in competition. Judging at the event included 24 classes, from antiques (pre-1916) through post-World War II sports cars, with special categories for Aston Martins and models from the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg group.   The Best of Show award went to a 1935 Duesenberg SJ Special owned by Harry Yeaggy of Cincinatti. Nicknamed The Mormon Meteor, the car was once raced by Ab Jenkins, who used it to set a 24-hour land speed record in 1935. Readers can see more images of the SJ, as well as some of the other vehicles on display, in this photo gallery. Full judging results can be viewed here.  Classic-car auctions attract much of the attention during Pebble Beach week. A sale run by Gooding & Company featured a set of first-series Rolls-Royce Silver Ghosts as well as a steam-powered vehicle from 1884, known as La Marquise, which is thought to be the world's oldest functioning automobile. La Marquise sold for $3,520,000 including the buyer's premium, well above the pre-auction estimate of just over $1.5 million. Full results from Gooding & Company are available here. La Marquise was featured in an article in Sunday's Times, as were the Rolls-Royces. RM Auctions also held a sale nearby, in Monterey. Results from that auction are available here.

2007-08-23,Zimbabwe: Price Crackdown Eased,"Faced with barren store shelves nationwide, the government has slightly eased its two-month rollback of prices, allowing retailers to mark up the prices of some basic commodities and farm goods by 20 percent. Most commodities vanished from stores when the government ordered all prices cut by at least 50 percent in late June; factories and retailers have been unwilling to restock, because the artificially low prices would have forced them to sell at a loss. The price rollback was an attempt to quell inflation, which was said by the government yesterday to average 7,600 percent a year but is regarded by experts to run at twice that rate. Those experts said the tiny price increases being allowed by the government were unlikely to spur production of new goods. The government has arrested, jailed or fined 12,000 business managers for violating price decrees under the rollback.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/world/africa/23briefs-prices.html

Tropical Depression 12 was spinning from the Bahamas toward Florida, but the chances of an American city’s being destroyed by nature were remote, even for one below sea level. An entire industry of weather bookies — scientists who calculate the likelihood of various natural disasters — had in effect set the odds: a storm that destroys $70 billion of insured property should strike the United States only once every 100 years. New Orleanians had made an art form of ignoring threats far more likely than this; indeed, their carelessness was a big reason they were supposedly more charming than other Americans. And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American. From Miami to San Francisco, the nation’s priciest real estate now faced beaches and straddled fault lines; its most vibrant cities occupied its most hazardous land. If, after World War II, you had set out to redistribute wealth to maximize the sums that might be lost to nature, you couldn’t have done much better than Americans had done.

Much of Richardson’s oeuvre was destroyed during his erratic career, which was marked by mental illness and homelessness. The first comprehensive overview of his work is being published this fall, including his unfinished autobiography. Edited by his son, “Bob Richardson” (Grafiche Damiani) features a wide range of his best work, like his daring assignments for Harper’s Bazaar — one infamous piece featured the model Donna Mitchel in tears — and early portraits of Anjelica Huston, then his girlfriend. “I am not ashamed of anything,” he said in 2002, three years before his death at the age of 77. “I have no secrets.

It makes no difference that Weinstein is a successful producer of movies (he and his brother, Bob, started Miramax Films) and that those movies defied all kinds of conventions to win a total of 45 Oscars. Nor is there anything about his person that would send a fashion editor up the wall. He is polite, gregarious, at times charming. None of the bad faults for which he is legendary in Hollywood — the screaming, the harassing — are on display in fashion circles. And maybe it is for that reason that something about the sight of this bearish hetero sitting among the thin, knowing fashionistas compels sympathy as much as bemusement.

2007-08-27,Nonfiction Chronicle,"THE HALF-LIFE OF AN AMERICAN ESSAYIST. By Arthur Krystal. (David R. Godine, $24.95.) Arthur Krystal is not really a go-getter. A self-described “aimless, melancholic, bumptious freelance writer,” he shirks fashionable topics, even if they might bring in a buck. In the engaging title piece of this slim, occasionally stuffy volume, Krystal makes a vigorous case for the virtues of old-fashioned literary criticism, twitting the navel gazers of “creative nonfiction,” which he dismisses as just a fancy word for memoir: “Writing interestingly about Jane Austen requires more imagination than confessing to having slept with someone named Jane Austen from Beaumont, Texas.” Krystal ranges widely, taking on subjects ranging from the typewriter to boxing, and he’s not afraid of weighty topics: he slogs through the notebooks of Paul Valéry, ponders different theories of beauty and offers a defense of the seven deadly sins. (“On the whole,” he writes, “it helps to have sin around; it’s like having a set of instructions for building a life that God approves of.”) In “My Holocaust Problem,” Krystal (whose grandparents died in the camps) complains that the profusion of Holocaust books, films and memorials — “the pomp and circumstance of remembrance” — has trivialized the event. If the argument isn’t terribly original, he subtly ponders the obligations of remembrance. In his charming concluding essay, “Who Speaks for the Lazy?,” Krystal returns to justifying his underachieving ways: “Let’s face it, some boys and girls become writers because the only workplace they’re willing to visit is the one inside their heads.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/review/Price2-t.html

Poor Holly Golightly, stuck in the ’60s, munching her breakfast in front of Tiffany’s windows, hankering after the diamonds on display.

Montandon’s book definitely isn’t her first. In 1968 she published a chic and sunny primer called “How to Be a Party Girl.” Poking around in that earlier book does give you a sense of what it must have been like to be Sean Wilsey. Chapter Five is titled “Why Is Everyone Naked, Mother?” The answer: “Shh, darling, this is a Garden of Eden Party. You’ll understand when you’re a little older. Run along, now.” Montandon’s book also includes this helpful advice: “Suppose you read in the newspaper one morning that a rarely seen comet is approaching Earth, and will be visible on a certain evening a few weeks off. Do you yawn and go on to the stock market reports and the obituaries? Not if you’re a Party Girl. You telephone the City Fathers ... and you ask them if they would like to lend you the Planetarium, for a Comet-Viewing Party.” When Playboy asked Montandon to pose for a centerfold, she declined: “Experts in the entertainment field tell me there’s such a thing as overexposure, and I certainly wouldn’t want to be a bore.” Alex Kuczynski reviews the new book this week.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/review/26tbr.html

The only time I wear pants is to walk my dog, and I wear them then only when the weather is freezing. Mostly, I use pants as a kind of fatness monitor: a particular pair of very narrow A.P.C. jeans functions like a scale. Twice a week, every week, I try them on. If they’re tight, I cut out chocolate; if they’re loose, I rejoice.

And she’s always been drawn to “religion and divinity, and how a physical life would fit into that.” Both strands appear in Steinke’s novels — which include “Suicide Blonde,” “Jesus Saves” and “Milk” — and are the heart of her most recent book, “Easter Everywhere,” a memoir about growing up as the daughter of a Lutheran minister, which appeared this spring. Why a memoir? “I had a lot of theological ideas about myself and about religion and God, and I felt they were getting in the way of my fiction writing,” Steinke said. “Everybody was in the pulpit. Fiction is so much about paradox and ambiguity — so is religion — but I had all these new exciting ideas getting in the way.” A devotee of Augustine’s “Confessions,” she thinks memoirs should transcend the pulp-paperback form — “I was a sinner and now I’ve been saved” — yet still engage with “ideas of spiritual transformation.” “I’m all for 12-step, but I want there to be some sense of people wrestling with God,” she said.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/review/Upfront-t.html

2007-08-27,Paperback Row,"THE GREAT DELUGE: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, by Douglas Brinkley. (Harper Perennial, $17.95. ) Interviewing hundreds of Katrina survivors, disaster responders and public officials, Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University in New Orleans, weaves their stories into a narrative of the hurricane’s first week. “The Great Deluge” harshly criticizes the inept response of the White House; FEMA; the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin; and the city’s police department, while crediting those who filled the breach. Our reviewer, David Oshinsky, said Brinkley provides “a groundlevel view of human behavior far richer than the breathless news reports that stunned and shamed the nation in the summer of 2005.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/review/0826bb-paperback.html

2007-08-27,‘Bad Monkeys’," It's a room an uninspired playwright might conjure while staring at a blank page: White walls. White ceiling. White floor.

2007-08-27,‘Oh the Hell of It All: A Memoir’," Almost everything was considered a sin while I was growing up as a preacher's daughter in Texas and Oklahoma in the '30s: makeup, dying one's hair, funny papers on Sunday, movies, short-sleeved dresses, and jewelry. Tent revival meetings with sermonizers exhorting sinners to confess dotted the landscape, which stretched mile after mile across the flat plains of the Lone Star State and throughout the rolling hills of Oklahoma.

2007-08-27,‘The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression’," Floods change the course of history, and the Flood of 1927 was no exception. When the waters of the Mississippi broke through banks and levees that spring, the disaster was enormous. A wall of water pushed down the river, covering the area where nearly a million lived. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover raced to Memphis and took command. Hoover talked railroads into transporting the displaced for free and carrying freight at a discount. He commandeered private outboard motors and built motorboats of plywood. He urged the people who were not yet flooded out, such as the population around the Bayou des Glaises levee, to evacuate early, then rescued with the trains those tens of thousands who had ignored his warning. He helped the Red Cross launch a fund drive; within a month the charity had already collected promises of more than $8 million, an enormous figure for the time.

2007-08-27,‘Bearing the Body’," It was a spring evening and he had come in too soon. Beyond the dining room window the catalpa tossed heavily, leaves grown huge this week, trailing seedpods comically like tassels. The light over the houses was a charged blue, not as in winter when it drained abruptly into night, but softer, a presence, almost liquid, an invitation, a tease. In the street, a car circled a second time, its radio up, and he leaned in to hear but caught only the thin edge of a melody before it turned the corner and faded.

2007-08-27,‘The Camel Bookmobile’," Fiona Sweeney shoved a pair of rolled-up jeans into the corner of her purple duffel bag. Outside her bedroom window, a siren's wail sliced through the white noise of a wet snowfall.

2007-08-27,‘India After Gandhi’," Freedom came to India on 15 August 1947, but patriotic Indians had celebrated their first ""Independence Day"" seventeen years before. In the first week of January 1930, the Indian National Congress passed a resolution fixing the last Sunday of the month for countrywide demonstrations in support of purna swaraj, or complete independence. This, it was felt, would both stoke nationalist aspirations and force the British to seriously consider giving up power. In an essay in his journal Young India, Mahatma Gandhi set out how the day should be observed: ""It would be good if the declaration [of independence] is made by whole villages, whole cities even.... It would be well if all the meetings were held at the identical minute in all the places."" ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/chapters/0826-1st-guha.html

2007-08-27,‘Circling My Mother: A Memoir’," In the year 1908, Pierre Bonnard painted The Bathroom and my mother was born. The posture of the young woman in the painting is that of someone enraptured by the miracle of light. The light is filtered through the lace curtains, and its patterning is reflected in the water that fills the tub into which she is about to step. Even the floral spread on the divan from which she has just risen is an emblem of prosperity and joy. Bonnard is famous for painting bathing women; in all her life my mother has never taken a bath. At three, she was stricken with polio, and she never had the agility to get in or out of a bathtub. She told me that once, after I was born, my father tried to lift her into a bath, but it made them both too nervous. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/chapters/0826-1st-gord.html

Meanwhile, the district attorney’s investigation into the case continues. An accompanying article by John Sullivan notes that the inspection system was revamped after seven people died in a Harlem apartment fire in 1987.

2007-08-28,Wheels: Inside a Citroën Museum of Sorts,"The Citroën Conservatoire includes an example of nearly every car ever produced by the automaker. More Photos  Tucked to one side of Citroën’s sprawling auto factory in Aulnay-sous-Bois, about 20 minutes outside of Paris, is a gray and mirrored-glass building surrounded by a fringe of green grass. One double-chevron logo adorns the awning of the entrance, but otherwise the structure is nondescript and incredibly reserved, like a warehouse from the future.   This is the Citroën Conservatoire, the company's private museum, which houses an extraordinary collection of cars and an example of nearly every car the company has ever produced.  Stepping inside it’s immediately clear that this is no parts depot. Rally cars, dune buggies, show concepts and elegant DS sedans from the 1950s all sit in orderly rows under high ceilings. A two-passenger helicopter powered by a Wankel rotary engine – developed by Citroën and the defunct German manufacturer, NSU – guards the end of a long line of former show cars dating back to the 1970s.   Photos: Inside the Citroën Conservatoire  Also included among the hundreds of classic cars are incredibly detailed and carefully organized archives: hand-written sales logs from the 1920s, original design sketches and even blueprints for the first Citroën dealerships.  The Conservatoire isn't usually open to the public, though this doesn’t mean that the cars in the collection are camera shy. Nearly all of the vehicles are kept in excellent running condition. Many are used on a regular basis, for a wide range of classic car events and publicity campaigns. On rare occasions, the Conservatoire is open to groups, including journalists and Citroën clubs from around the world.  I walked down row after row and found a gold-colored mystery machine hidden among the rest of the cars. Built sometime around 2000 -- Citroën isn’t clear about the exact date -- it was only a foam mock-up, and lacked an engine and interior. Based on the humdrum Citroën Xantia sedan, its mini pickup lines were awkward. To be honest, it’s unremarkable in every way except one: it was a little-known styling exercise for a proposed return to the United States market.   Denis Huile, director of the Conservatoire, pointed out one small clue to the concept’s American aspirations. Rather than sitting on Citroën’s standard Michelin tires, this car wore chunky all-terrain Goodyears. Yet the car never appeared at an auto show and, to the best of Mr. Huile’s ample knowledge, was never given an official name. In the end, nothing came of the proposed return to the United States, and the idea faded into obscurity.   But in an automobile museum that really isn’t a museum, is it any wonder that the most intriguing car is the one that doesn’t even have a name?

2007-08-29,Orders for Simpson Book Soar,"Beaufort Books, the publisher of “If I Did It,” the recently revived book in which O. J. Simpson hypothesizes about how he might have murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in 1994, announced yesterday that it would print 125,000 copies and would likely go back to press before the book is released around Sept 13. Eric Kampmann, owner and president of Beaufort, said the company already had orders for 116,000 copies from chain bookstores, independents and online retailers. Although Barnes & Noble announced that it would not sell the book in its stores, advance orders online at bn.com propelled it to No. 1 on its best-seller list on Monday, and it hovered between No. 2 and 5 yesterday. Last fall, after a public outcry, HarperCollins scuttled plans for a 400,000-copy print run by its Regan Books imprint. Since then, the Goldman family won the rights in bankruptcy court to publish the book. Separately, Denise Brown, sister of Ms. Brown Simpson, said yesterday in a statement that she was withdrawing from a planned Sept. 13 appearance on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” alongside members of the Goldman family. “At the time of accepting this proposition from Oprah, a publisher was not yet established, and publication was still pending,” Ms. Brown said, adding: “Since then, the Goldmans have retained a publisher who is rushing the book to market as we speak. And thus, has made the show a moot point for me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/books/29arts-ORDERSFORSIM_BRF.html

Taking place in summer and at Easter time, the festival operates in the Culture and Convention Center on Lake Lucerne, a much-praised modern building designed by Jean Nouvel. It has been trying to compete with its better-known rivals in Salzburg, Austria and Bayreuth, Germany, both opera destinations. “This project represents a quantum leap for the Lucerne Festival,” said Jürg Reinshagen, the festival’s board president, “and will position Lucerne even more prominently at the forefront of the international music scene.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/arts/music/29arts-LUCERNETOGET_BRF.html

This has been done many times in history, and for a reminder, I turn to one of my favorite studies, Aileen Ribeiro’s “Dress and Morality” (Holmes & Meier Publishers: 1986). She cites Richard Steele, in The Spectator, from 1711: “The most improper things we commit in the conduct of our lives, we are led into by the force of fashion.” People who complain that there is nothing new in fashion are quite correct. Fashion has always offended someone. But I wonder whether the Atlanta council members who support the ban are appalled at the “indecency” of baggy pants or the fact that the look has been so lasting and pervasive in our culture.

The American Library Association defines a challenge as a “formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.” Other books on the 2006 list included the Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison’s “Bluest Eye” and her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Beloved,” both challenged for language and sexual content.

The art, a sharp departure from Mr. Botero’s familiar images of corpulent figures, was based on photographs and testimony of the detainees. One painting depicts a prisoner face to face with a snarling dog; others show naked and beaten Iraqis in heaps on cell floors. The art toured Europe in 2005, was displayed at Berkeley this year and is now on view in Milan in a Botero retrospective. Although his works regularly sell at auction for $1 million or $2 million, he has said that this series is not for sale and should have a home in the United States or Baghdad. ...

He declined to say whether he would be willing to hive them off for the deal to go through. The original plan to combine Suez and Gaz de France is now valued at about 56 billion euros ($76 billion).

2007-08-31,Closing the Book (by Opening Books) on Summer Rituals,"When I see people immersed in a book in public, I always wonder what they’re reading. Sometimes, on the subway, I even move closer to sneak a peek at the title. Since I grew up reading in New York, I know, too, that the city itself can infuse the experience of a book. So when my editors asked for volunteers with ideas for our Summer Rituals series, I leaped at the chance to roam the city with my curiosity unleashed, hunting for readers to interview. My article, which ends the series, was put up on the Web today and will appear in Saturday’s paper.Jury duty did crimp my plans a bit. I had hoped to return to a garden at the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park, where I used to go sometimes as a teenager to find just the right reading atmosphere. (Mainly what I recall reading there is “The Lady’s Not for Burning,” a delightful play in verse by Christopher Fry that is set in 1400; it was a gloomy autumn day, though, and Gregorian chant was playing in the background.)",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/closing-the-book-by-opening-books-on-summer-rituals/

2007-09-03,Fantasy Football Intervention,"I’m hooked on the A&E show “Intervention.” If you haven’t seen it (and if not, you should start TiVO’ing it post haste) this is the premise: they follow an addict — usually coke/crack, heroin, crustal meth or alcohol — and chronicle the typical day-to-day life of addiction. The lying, the stealing, the manipulating of friends and loved ones. It can be depressing at times, but it’s as riveting as HBO’s “Flight of the Conchords” is hysterical (unlike “The Two Coreys,” which I had high hopes for, but is clearly scripted, totally unfunny, and Haim looks like he’s been riding life’s Tilt-a-Whirl for wayyyy too long.)",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/fantasy-football-intervention/
