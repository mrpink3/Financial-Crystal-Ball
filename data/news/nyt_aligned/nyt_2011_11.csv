She’s now designing higher-end baubles under her own name. The first Nora Kogan collection, Anastasia, is inspired by a Fabergé egg that, according to family lore, her Russian grandfather acquired during World War II in exchange for a box of chocolates. The egg disappeared — presumably into the pockets of a Soviet customs official — when the family immigrated to Australia in the 1970s, but Kogan retains clear memories of it. “It opened up into three sections, and in the center was a hand-painted icon,” recalls Kogan, who riffs on Fabergé’s legendary craftsmanship and stylized nature motifs in pieces like these diamond drop earrings and ring. “Designing this collection has been therapeutic for me as I’m still often haunted by this loss.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/first-came-the-egg-nora-kogans-ode-to-faberge/

2011-11-02,"Now Playing | ‘Parallax,’ the New Album by Atlas Sound","Inscrutable? Cryptic? Finding the right word to describe Bradford Cox is not easy. The Atlanta-based musician, lead singer of the popular indie rock band Deerhunter and mastermind behind the more esoteric solo project Atlas Sound, is tall and lanky and moves with a long, excited gait thanks to a genetic condition of the connective tissue called Marfan Syndrome. He’s gone through wild periods of provocation involving onstage cross-dressing and fake blood. He’s written song lyrics inspired by subversive Dennis Cooper novels. Spending time with him is a roller coaster ride that sweeps those around him up through various random-seeming whims and high-strung emotions. Despite all of this, or more likely because of all this, he is prolific with at least eleven albums and EPs to his name since 2005. His latest album, “Parallax,” released under his solo moniker, further proves Cox’s lo-fi genius, showcasing his deftness at weaving multilayered lyrics through harmonizing electronic tones and across undulating beats to create catchy but complex pop songs. It’s worth noting that the album’s title refers to the optical effect wherein our perceptions of various objects’ relative positions depend on our distance from them — if you drive down a highway, the tree line whizzes past while faraway objects like the sun barely move at all. It’s one of those facts in nature that seems intuitive and yet, upon examination, gets quite confusing quite fast. The same can be said of Cox’s songs. Here we present an exclusive stream of the complete “Parallax” album (out next week, Nov. 8, from 4AD), along with a few words from Cox explaining the meaning of and inspiration behind four of his favorite songs — explanations he offers in his own signature fashion, without making any distinction between the technical, musical, literary or lyrical aspects of his work.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/now-playing-parallax-the-new-album-by-atlas-sound/

The network said on Wednesday that it would bring the series back next year, potentially extending “The X Factor” in the alternating annual schedule it has set up with “American Idol” (“Factor” in the fall, “Idol” in the spring). Regular telecasts of “The X Factor,” created by Simon Cowell, have averaged about 13.5 million viewers since the series started in September. It has sharply improved Fox’s performance on Wednesday and Thursday nights, but it has underwhelmed the television industry, partly because “Idol” is higher rated and partly because Mr. Cowell said ahead of time that he expected 20 million viewers to tune in. In an interview last week he said that he had overstated the ratings potential of the series but expected the ratings to pick up as the viewer voting period began on Wednesday night.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/arts/television/fox-renews-the-x-factor.html

The band’s frontman, alternatively known as Black Francis and Frank Black, has said that these reunion shows are purely about cashing in on the band’s indie-rock credibility. However, having now seen them live, I can tell you that this is not the whole story. They simply played too well, and were too obviously moved by the unconditional love of the crowd, which cheered as vociferously for the B-sides as for the singles. Frank howled as ferociously as ever, and it was inspiring to see Kim Deal, the bass player, in such apparently sound mental and physical health. This I did not expect. In 2002, a story in this magazine by Ethan Smith detailed the problems, personal and otherwise, she had making a record for her other band, the Breeders.

Mr. Shields found a lonely talkative octogenarian who had scores to settle and a reputation that badly needed restoring. Vonnegut had once told Martin Amis that the only way he could regain credit for his early work, those books from the 1950s and 1960s once so beloved by college kids, would be to die. He died on April 11, 2007, less than a year after Mr. Shields first approached him. And the two did not spend much time together. But Vonnegut gave the go-ahead that has allowed Mr. Shields to construct “And So It Goes,” an incisive, gossipy page-turner of a biography, even if it’s hard to tell just how authorized this book really is. Denied permission to quote from Vonnegut’s letters, Mr. Shields relies on paraphrases and patchwork to create a seamless-sounding account. Astonishingly, this book has nearly 1,900 notes to identify separate sources and quotations.

2011-11-03,Vain Glorious | Takamichi Moves to the Bowery,"For the devoted group of New Yorkers who’ve experienced Takamichi Saeki’s scissor work firsthand, there is no going back from the “Takamichi cut.” Now this former gallerist, avid soccer player and longtime resident of the Lower East Side is moving his salon and team of eight stylists from the loft on Great Jones Street that’s been the home of Takamichi Hair since 2004 to a stylish new studio on the Bowery. Designed by the Belgian architect Sandra van Rolleghem to feel more like an apartment than a designer hair factory, the new space features custom touches, including hand-painted storage cabinets; an origami light fixture by a French designer, Éric Guen; artwork by the downtown pioneer Richard Hambleton and the Barcelona, Spain-born Santi Moix — both friends of Saeki — and a reproduction of a round Hermès mirror with leather trim from the 1920s. “We wanted it to feel like a home,” the architect told me on a recent visit. With neighbors like the New Museum, Sperone Westwater gallery and the much-anticipated Bowery Diner, Takamichi Hair’s new location fits this stretch of the Bowery like the perfect cut.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/vain-glorious-takamichi-moves-to-the-bowery/

Currently, Pakistan admits fewer than 2,000 types of Indian products. Both countries have said they want to more than double trade between them, to $6 billion a year. Consumers in Pakistan are likely to benefit more from the change, gaining access to more and cheaper Indian goods. Pakistani businesses will likely face stiffer competition, especially in auto parts, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods. Policy makers also hope the move encourages progress on other trade issues, like India’s product-quality standards, which Pakistan says inhibit its exports.

For New York sports fans of a certain age, that is wildly off the mark; we all know it was Willis Reed. The captain of the Knicks strode — not limped, strode — onto the hardwood court of Madison Square Garden on the evening of May 8, 1970, moments before the start of the seventh and deciding game of the National Basketball Association finals, rallying from a crippling injury, inspiring his teammates to vanquish the Los Angeles Lakers, winning New York its first N.B.A. championship. That game — that moment — was the high point of a seven-year run, from the late ’60s to the mid-’70s, when the Knicks became the object of some of the most inflamed passions this side of Rudolph Valentino, Elvis and the Beatles.

2011-11-03,The Nurturing of JFK,"As President Obama struggles to find his political footing, it is hard to avoid the suspicion that at least some of his woes may be rooted in a historical Democratic Party presidential divide. On the one side are what might be called loners; on the other, dynasts. The loners — Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter — were brilliant professorial types who campaigned as moralistic, independent reformers and came to grief. By contrast, the members of family dynasties — Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy — were intimately familiar with rivalries and power politics long before they entered the Oval Office.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/jack-kennedy-elusive-hero-by-chris-matthews-book-review.html

It is, for all its profound sadnesses, an exuberant account, overflowing with life and with a joy in language. But Oz is a versatile writer, and he returns, in his fine new story collection, “Scenes From Village Life,” to a spare, almost allegorical style, in which the silence around the words also signifies. Admirably rendered in English by Oz’s longtime translator, Nicholas de Lange, these linked stories prove achingly melancholy, a cumulative vision of anomie and isolation in an apparently cozy Israeli village.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/scenes-from-village-life-by-amos-oztranslated-by-nicholas-de-lange-book-review.html

Greenfield, who reviews Harvey Araton’s “When the Garden Was Eden,” added: “I am much less devoted to the N.B.A. than in years past, probably because of the decade of Knick ineptitude, the ticket prices and, more broadly, a style of play across much of the league that calls into question the definition of a ‘team sport.’ (One passing thought: the Knicks’ ownership is a powerful case for a confiscatory pre-mortem inheritance tax.)”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/up-front-jeff-greenfield.html

The pop diva has been touring without a break since early June, performing nearly 60 concerts on three continents to promote her album “Loud” (Def Jam). A concert promoter for Live Nation in Sweden, Kristofer Akesson, told the Associated Press that Rihanna, who is 23, “is exhausted and doesn’t feel well.” Her publicist in New York said she was suffering from the flu. The singer called off a concert in Malmo in southern Sweden on Monday, and sent a photograph of her arm with the tube from an intravenous drip to her followers on Twitter with a note saying, “Sorry Malmo!!!” She was not hospitalized as some news outlets reported. She performed Tuesday night in Stockholm, then called off a second performance on Wednesday night after consulting with a doctor.Rihanna joins several high-profile performers who have cancelled major concerts for health reasons this year, among them Adele, who is undergoing surgery to repair bleeding in her vocal chords, Taylor Swift, who had a bout of laryngitis, and Caleb Followill, the lead singer for Kings of Leon, who cancelled half his band’s tour to rest his voice. Rihanna’s decision to cancel two shows came as her single, “We Found Love,” featuring Calvin Harris, rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. It was the 11th No. 1 single she has recorded, giving her the same number as Whitney Houston and more top singles than Stevie Wonder or Janet Jackson.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/rihanna-cancels-sweden-shows-for-flu/

Each year at the time of the fair, Eyck switches gears from curator to editor by selecting a different designer with whom he delves into a traditional material and craft. Past explorations have yielded flax rope furniture and lighting by Christien Meindertsma, brightly colored striped woolen blankets and pillows by Scholten & Baijings, and pewter objects by Studio Job. For Schwarm, he worked with the German artists Beate Reinheimer and Ulrike Rehm, known as RaR, who are fascinated with the dizzying diversity of the animal kingdom, particularly among insects. To wit, Schwarm features 10 different shapes, or genuses, and 63 species, each with a different glaze. They are being sold as a limited-edition set or individually, for the less entomologically inclined. For more information, go to thomaseyck.com.

2011-11-04,Memories of the Bush Administration,"The administration of George W. Bush has already produced a remarkable body of contemporary history from a large group of talented journalists and writers — Jane Mayer, Thomas E. Ricks, James Risen, Ron Suskind, Susan Faludi, Seymour M. Hersh, James Mann and many others. But in the last year, several members of the Bush administration have retaliated with books of their own. Among the most significant are former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s “Known and Unknown” and former Vice President Dick Cheney’s “In My Time,” memoirs by perhaps the two most important figures (other than the president) in the years of terrorism and war. Both books have received mostly negative reviews — largely deserved. Rumsfeld’s book is dense and bloated, although modestly candid. Cheney’s is clearly written (with help from his daughter Liz Cheney), but with the exception of its last chapters, dry, earnest and dull. None of this seems to have had much impact on their sales.

2011-11-04,Being Charles Dickens,"Robert DOUGLAS-FAIRHURST, the Oxford scholar who is one of Charles Dickens’s two new biographers, rightly calls his subject “at once the most central and most eccentric literary figure” of his age, and the investigations into the dark corners of that eccentric life began with Dickens himself. In 1849 he showed a short account of his early years to his close friend John Forster, revealing a story he never told his own family: the shame-inducing months he spent, while his father was in a debtor’s prison, as a 12-year-old “laboring hind” in a factory that bottled shoe-blacking. The first volume of the biography he’d wanted Forster to write — which made the ­blacking-factory episode public — appeared in 1872, two years after Dickens died at the age of 58, and its successors keep coming. The Dickens biographies published just in the past 25 years make an impressive stack.

Mr. Gilmore said “recent controversies” had no bearing on the decision, citing the government’s need to reduce expenses under the terms of a European Union bailout package. The government is also closing embassies in East Timor and Iran, he said. The Vatican withdrew its ambassador to Ireland in July after an Irish government report said the Vatican had discouraged bishops from reporting cases of sexual abuse to the police, a charge the Vatican rejects. The Vatican said Thursday that every state was “free to decide” whether or not to have an envoy in Rome, but what counts are diplomatic relations, “and these are not in question with regards to Ireland.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/world/europe/ireland-will-close-embassy-to-vatican.html

A spokeswoman for the bishops’ conference said that Mr. Avila’s column was not approved by the bishops, and that the church does not have a definitive theory on the origins of same-sex attraction.

2011-11-04,Welcome to the Church of ‘Godspell’,"“GODSPELL,” the 1971 musical about Jesus and his apostles, brings to the stage a vision of spirituality so earnest that it can veer perilously close to self-parody. With its thrift-store costuming and vaudeville-style song-and-dance numbers, the show is the ultimate in accessible feel-good Christianity. In the 2000 movie “Meet the Parents” Ben Stiller’s future in-laws ask him to say grace, and the only words he can conjure are the lyrics to “Day by Day,” the “Godspell” ditty that the composer Stephen Schwartz set to lyrics from a 13th-century Roman Catholic prayer. Everyone, even a nervous Jew under the watchful eye of a C.I.A. agent father-in-law, remembers those tunes.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/theater/broadway-revival-of-godspell.html

For Mallea, a Cuban-American architect who is based in New York, the book grew out of a longstanding fascination with his family’s history. One of his great-grandfathers was a photojournalist, and Mallea began to collect vintage Cuban photography. “I loved the information that those photographs contained,” he recalled, “and visualizing what life was like at those points in time.” Mallea was invited to Havana to give a presentation on his research, which led to more talks, and before he knew it, the architect had a book contract. He made eight trips in all, accompanied by his partner in life and in the firm M(Group), the interior designer Carey Maloney, who served as a “stylist” —  but only in a manner of speaking, given what Mallea called the “almost guerrilla-style photography” of the book. (He worked with two different photographers in Havana and also used archival photographs.) “Lots of people let me in,” he explained, “but no one wanted me to stay long, so you won’t see flower arrangements.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/design-bookshelf-great-houses-of-havana/

For years, Didion has stood as something of a literary beacon, guiding other writers through the chancy straits of narrative reporting. It was not until she published “The Year of Magical Thinking” in 2005, though, that her work became a signal light to travelers along the mainstream too. “Magical Thinking” narrated the unexpected death of her husband, John Gregory Dunne, through the rhythms of obsessive memory. “Blue Nights” takes a similar approach. The book’s chief subject is Didion’s daughter, Quintana, who died in 2005 after a long hospitalization, but the account ranges across several decades, scrutinizing memory fragments and details for clues foreshadowing Quintana’s death. Didion dwells on her own ailments as well — she was 75 at the time of the writing and a victim of shingles, an aneurysm, neuropathy and a mysterious blackout — and although none of this territory is new, her account is sharp and unsettling in the alchemic proportions fans have come to expect. Reading Didion today, more than ever, means submitting almost fully to the strange authority of the voice on the page.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/riff-joan-didion-blue-nights.html

It had a thunderous canned-orchestra melody, like an endless loop of some bombastic moment from Wagner or Danny Elfman; a sternum-rattling bass line; and skittering electronic percussion that brought to mind artillery fire. When the track was finished, he e-mailed it to a rapper named Waka Flocka Flame.

2011-11-04,True North | Mats Gustafson,"When you walk into the artist and illustrator Mats Gustafson’s apartment in Stockholm, you’re not quite sure what era you’re in. In the foyer, a turn-of-the-century painting of a bourgeois Swedish interior hangs beneath one of Isamu Noguchi’s oversize paper lanterns, and underfoot is a colorful mid-20th-century rug by Barbro Nilsson for the renowned Swedish workshop MMF. Under a midcentury nude painted by Birger Ljungquist, Gustafson’s great-uncle, sits a simple 1950s stool by the Swedish designer Carl Malmsten. Walk through an angled doorway into the living room, a high-ceilinged space with the graceful proportions and architectural ornament typical of late-19th-century buildings, and the mix gets even richer. An upholstered 19th-century Swedish bench along the window and a group of slipper chairs, all from Gustafson’s family, blend easily with sheepskin-covered wood chairs designed in the 1930s by Bruno Mathsson and tables by Josef Frank. Vases by Scandinavian Modern ceramics masters like Axel Salto and Berndt Friberg are clustered atop a traditional tiled fireplace, and the immaculate plaster walls (which are painted, aptly enough, Stockholm White) are hung with Gustafson’s spare, elegant watercolors. Venture into the apartment’s long corridor, however, and you’ll find up-to-the-minute bathrooms and a sunny, south-facing kitchen in which crisp, utilitarian cabinets provide a clean backdrop for an antique wooden table and chairs. This is an interior that’s modern and old-fashioned at the same time, and in all the right ways.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/true-north/

The savagery of the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan may have culled the global population by about 11 percent; two bloody upheavals in China — the An Lushan Rebellion and the collapse of the Xin Dynasty — each may have felled about 6 percent of humanity. Those are but 3 of the 100 worst atrocities in history, as cataloged by Matthew White in “The Great Big Book of Horrible Things,” an amusing (really) account of the murderous ways of despots, slave traders, blundering royals, gladiators and assorted hordes. Estimating the tolls from such horrors is an inexact science, given war’s nature and the mysteries of antiquity. The deadliest “multicides” are more plentiful in recent centuries, given that there were more people to kill and better ways to kill them on a grand scale. Even so, killings as a percentage of all humanity are probably declining. Here is a look at the sweep of human brutality presented in a timeline. ",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/opinion/sunday/population-control-marauder-style.html

2011-11-07,Downbeat Realms of Grunge,"Set 20 years after Kurt Cobain’s death, “Verse Chorus Verse,” at the Cherry Lane Studio Theater, is one bitter valentine to the legacy of grunge. Written by Randall Colburn, a Chicago playwright, it extols that musical phenomenon even as it sifts through the lives of survivors wandering its smoking embers. The show, a collaboration between the Barefoot Theater Company and East 3rd Productions, has a heart clearly in rock: the business, the musicians’ way of life. But the story probes dark corners, using a ghastly actual incident that happened in Tacoma, Wash., as its historical point of origin.

Lip Syncing on ‘X Factor’,"Producers of the singing competition show “The X Factor,” on Fox, have come under fire after a contestant’s noticeable lip-syncing gaffe occurred in a live episode on Thursday night. The contestant, Leroy Bell, left, was clearly out-of-sync with his own audio track during a performance of “Without You” by David Guetta and Usher, according to Entertainment Weekly’s Web site. All 12 finalists took part in the opening number, but Mr. Bell missed his cue just enough that the cameras, and a portion of the show’s audience, caught him not moving his mouth at all while his voice was heard through the speakers. In a statement released to Entertainment Weekly on Friday, Fox and the show’s producers said: “All competitive songs, including survival songs, are performed live to a backing track. Due to the finalists’ extensive preparation for their Wednesday night performances, the opening ensemble number on the results show is prerecorded, the same way as on other shows.” One of those shows is Fox’s “American Idol,” which dealt with a similar situation two years ago. After accusations of lip syncing were leveled then, a spokesman for FremantleMedia North America, the company that produces “American Idol” for Fox, admitted that the contestants sang along to their own recorded vocal tracks during group performances.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/arts/television/is-nothing-sacred-lip-syncing-on-x-factor.html

The still-untitled novel — Mr. Rudnick’s first foray into the young-adult genre — depicts an 18-year-old girl’s journey to New York, where she meets a fashion designer who makes her an offer that seems too good to be true. “The designer offers her a chance to become not only the most beautiful woman in the world but the most beautiful woman who has ever lived,” Mr. Rudnick said in a telephone interview. “And that’s just the first chapter.” He also said the book would explore “the power of duty and the importance the world attaches to physical perfection, something that I’d imagine young women have to deal with 24 hours a day.” The deal includes an option for a second book that, according to Mr. Rudnick, may or may not be a direct sequel.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/books/paul-rudnick-to-write-a-young-adult-novel.html

Over Cholera Epidemic," A human rights group filed claims on Tuesday seeking at least $250 million in damages from the United Nations and its peacekeeping force in Haiti on behalf of 5,000 cholera victims. The group, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, accuses the peacekeeping force, known as Minustah, of inadequate troop screening and improper sanitation that, the group said, had caused Haiti’s cholera epidemic. More than 6,600 people have died and nearly a half-million more have been sickened since the cholera outbreak began in October 2010. The group also seeks establishment of a forum to hear its claims, which were filed with Minustah’s claims office in Port-au-Prince. United Nations peacekeeping missions generally have immunity from actions in national courts. A spokesman for the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations said the agency would have no comment until it had studied the claim.

Mr. Chávez, left, who said he had surgery in June to remove a malignant tumor, said he would invite President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil; her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who began treatment for throat cancer late last month; and President Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. “There will be no cancer or force that can hold us back because Latin America is experiencing a rebirth,” Mr. Chávez told Venezuelan state television on Sunday. He said would wait to hold the summit meeting until after Mr. da Silva completed his chemotherapy. After several rounds of chemotherapy, mostly in Cuba, Mr. Chávez, 57, said last month that he was cancer-free. Ms. Rousseff, 63, received a diagnosis of lymphatic cancer in 2009 before her election, and doctors have said she is currently free of cancer. Mr. Lugo, 60, who was found to have lymphatic cancer in August 2010, has undergone treatment in Brazil and has also been declared cancer-free.

2011-11-10,TransCanada Shuts Pipeline After Troubles With Power," The company proposing a controversial oil pipeline that would stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast had a related pipeline shut down twice this week after it experienced power problems. The company, TransCanada, said that its Keystone pipeline, which runs from Alberta to Cushing, Okla., went down for three hours on Tuesday after a Canadian utility that powers the pipeline dealt with shortages. It shut it down again on Tuesday night to inspect equipment, but restarted it on Wednesday morning after finding nothing amiss, the company said. “Nothing was related to the safety of the pipeline or compromised the safety of the pipeline in any way,” a company spokesman said. The interruptions were ill timed for TransCanada, which is in the midst of a bitter battle over whether its proposed Keystone XL line will be approved by the State Department. Opponents of the pipeline, which would carry Canadian oil sands crude, are increasing efforts to have it rejected or rerouted amid concerns that a spill could damage the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska. And the State Department’s inspector general agreed this week to look into assertions that an environmental review of the project was mishandled by the State Department because it was conducted by a company with financial ties to TransCanada.

2011-11-10,Lounge Act | Moss and Maharam,"Talk about a makeover. Among the latest offerings at the SoHo design mecca Moss is this pair of vintage Eames Lounge Chairs, which Murray Moss decided to re-cover in Hella Jongerius’s Repeat Dot fabric from Maharam. The chairs (which have been manufactured by Herman Miller since 1956) have a built-in pedigree because they’re made with Brazilian rosewood veneer, the material that was originally specified by Charles and Ray Eames, but which was discontinued in 1992 when Brazilian rosewood landed on the endangered species list. Jongerius’s eye-popping fabric, however, is what really makes them — it takes a design icon from the “Mad Men” era and catapults it into the 21st century. (As with many Moss creations, these don’t come cheap: the chairs are $16,000 each, or $30,000 for the pair.) They’re just the first (or first two) in a planned series of one-off furniture pieces on which Moss and Maharam will collaborate. And for a glimpse of what other designs Maharam might bring to the project, see “Maharam Agenda” (Lars Müller Publishers), a new book on the innovative textile company by Michael Maharam, who has run the family-owned business with his brother, Stephen, since 1997. The book not only describes the brothers’ risk-taking design agenda, but it looks like an agenda, too, complete with a soft cover (an embroidered design by Jongerius) and woven bookmark — a tip-off right there that this isn’t going to be your average corporate coffee-table book.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/lounge-act-moss-and-maharam/

2011-11-10,Once Upon a Time in New York City,"Every children’s book should be infused with emotion, starting with a sense of wonder. For me, the first great book of my childhood was “The Story of Babar,” by Jean de Brunhoff, published in the United States in 1933. When I was 5, a year before Pearl Harbor, my mother showed me the book at the public library in my Brooklyn neighborhood. She told me decades later that when she saw the look on my face, she borrowed Babar and took us both home. We would borrow it, and its successors, many more times.

2011-11-10,Asked & Answered | Charlotte Rampling,"There aren’t many film stars who, entering their golden years, endure as icons of sensuality. Charlotte Rampling, 65 years old and un-retouched (both on screen and in real life), is one of them. The daughter of a British colonel and NATO commander, Rampling attended tony girls’ schools in France and England. She modeled briefly, before trying films, and burst onto the scene in “Georgy Girl” (1966), in which she played a flirt who is the embodiment of Swinging London. Today, after five decades on screen (including a star turn in Visconti’s classic, “The Damned”), and modeling for everyone from Helmut Newton to Juergen Teller, Rampling’s career shows no signs of abating.

2011-11-11,Bishop Asks That Video Be Cut From Brooklyn Museum Show,"After the Catholic League and several members of Congress objected last year to a video by the artist David Wojnarowicz, the Smithsonian pulled the work from a large group show, “Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture,” at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. The video, “A Fire in My Belly,” is again stirring up objections, this time from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which objects to a sequence that shows ants crawling over a crucifix. The Brooklyn Museum plans to restore the video to the traveling “Hide/Seek” exhibition, which is scheduled to run there from next Friday through Feb. 12. Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio wrote to John Tamagni, the chairman of the museum’s board, about a month ago, requesting that the video be eliminated from the show, said Stefanie Gutierrez, the diocese’s press secretary. Arnold Lehman, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, said the correspondence was private, but that he believed Mr. Tamagni had responded by assuring the bishop that “nothing in the exhibition was meant to be offensive.” “Hide/Seek,” which focuses on issues of sexual identity and gender, includes 67 artists and more than 100 works, Mr. Lehman added, saying the letter explained that “we were reproducing the exhibition that was at the National Portrait Gallery as originally intended by curators.” Before he died of complications from AIDS in 1992, Mr. Wojnarowicz testified in court about the video during a previous controversy and said he was thinking of how Jesus took on the suffering of the world. “I wanted to make a symbol that would show that he would take on the suffering of the vast amounts of addiction that I saw on the streets,” he said. “And I did this because I saw very little treatment available for people who had this illness.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/arts/design/bishop-asks-that-video-be-cut-from-brooklyn-museum-show.html

2011-11-11,"No Blockbusters Here, Just Mind Expanders","THERE are a multiplicity of adjectives that fit Ernie Gehr’s experimental film and digital work: abstract, beautiful, mysterious, invigorating, utopian. The work can also be oblique; this is not a bad thing! His 14-minute film “History” (1970), to take one extreme example, largely consists of what looks like a sparkly black-and-gray blob that brings to mind a hallucination of a desert night sky, like van Gogh on acid. What you’re looking at, and perhaps losing yourself in, isn’t a representation of something outside the camera, but film itself: those clouds of dye in color film and churning grains in black and white that make up the actual image you see.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/movies/ernie-gehrs-films-traffic-in-images-and-light.html

2011-11-11,Misunderstanding Racial Justice,"There’s no more polarizing legal battle in America today than the one over the meaning of discrimination. On the left, many progressives insist that any policies and practices that disadvantage people on the basis of race, sex, age or disability should be illegal, and some have carried this principle to illogical extremes — suing to block ladies’ nights at singles bars, for example, or even to forbid Mother’s Day. On the right, many conservatives insist that the Constitution is so colorblind that the government may never take race into account under any circumstances, and the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has carried this principle to similarly illogical extremes — claiming that policies designed to integrate public schools, for example, are impossible to distinguish from those designed to segregate them.

There they will find Cody on the verge of death, joined at his hospital bedside by his mother and the emotionally unstable pain management doctor who is about to become, disastrously, his girlfriend. They will find, in other words, the throttle shoved all the way forward. The resulting G-force of sex and death and insanity — and also, improbably, of music and math and modernist poetry — is the only evidence you need that for all its seeming formlessness, “[Sic]” is in fact as artfully constructed as a Tarantino film.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/books/review/sic-a-memoir-by-joshua-cody-book-review.html

2011-11-11,We Are Still Not Ready,"Wil Hylton’s article “How Ready Are We for Bioterrorism?” raised important concerns about how hard it is to protect the country from naturally occurring and man-made biological threats. He outlined how the lack of profitability and the bureaucratic hoops required to get vaccines and medical countermeasures to market can mean we’re often our own worst enemy. But he missed an equally important and extremely troubling part of the equation: cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to state budgets mean that even when we have medicines and vaccines, we aren’t in a position to get them to Americans quickly. Federal support for preparedness has been gutted, dropping 37 percent since fiscal year 2005, and state and local health departments have cut an estimated 44,000 workers between 2008 and 2010. After Sept. 11 and anthrax, we built up biodefense capabilities, but we’re moving backward. When the next tragedy strikes, we will not be ready.

Now he has raised the stakes — widening both the emotional palette and the spectrum of human and canine abuse — in a feature-length film he wrote and directed, “Tyrannosaur,” centered on the same less-than-lovable protagonist.

He says, “It came back to me only after a year, as if a presence that lingered, but never disappeared.” That’s when Milella, whose work has previously appeared in T Magazine, suggested he shoot the tree for the magazine. In our business, a good idea doesn’t ordinarily have a shelf life of a year, but given that some trees in the ancient bristlecone pine forest are likely 5,000 years old, we had a little more wiggle room with the publication date than usual.

Adam has a similar approach with Carhartt. He’s making something that’s fashionable but that someone in a rural area can still appreciate.”Adam Kimmel x Carhartt, $40-$425.

Thanks to clever new digital devices, a dry philodendron, undernourished hibiscus, or sadly neglected wandering Jew can send its owner a text or Twitter message. Humans like to feel appreciated, so a begonia may also send a simple “Thank-you” text — when it’s happy, as gardeners like to say, meaning healthy and well-tended. Picture your Boston fern home alone placing Botanicalls. But why should potted plants be the only ones to reassure their humans? Another company has found a way for crops to send text messages in unison, letting their farmer know if she’s doing a good enough job to deserve a robust harvest. What is the sound of one hand of bananas clapping?

(The group defined “voluntary euthanasia” as taking the life of someone who has expressed a wish to die but is incapable of performing the act.) Any system to assist suicides, the report said, must be carefully regulated and monitored. The issues have been debated extensively in recent years after several high-profile court cases.

2011-11-17,Asked & Answered | Lawrence Weschler,"It’s hard to keep up with Lawrence Weschler. The celebrated author of over a dozen books of literary nonfiction is, in this age of self-branding, defiantly unbrandable. An artist who draws money and tries to spend his drawings; the eccentric proprietor of Los Angeles’s Museum of Jurassic Technology; the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars: this is Weschler’s idea of a beat. (Fittingly, a journal he founded some years back was called “Omnivore.”) He has devoted years of inquiry into political movements and the curious nature of artistic expression, most famously in his 1982 biography of the artist Robert Irwin, “Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees.” His newest book, “Uncanny Valley: Adventures in the Narrative” (Counterpoint Press), collects pieces, previously published in Artforum, The New Yorker, Wired and elsewhere, about such disparate subjects as digital animators and human-rights monitors, but which are connected by the kind of distinct, inimitable narrative thread only Weschler can weave. On the eve of a discussion of the book at the Open Society Institute in New York, The Moment spoke to Weschler about Richard Avedon, war films and why he was so embarrassed to discover a drawing of him by David Hockney, pictured above, in the home of a Chicago art collector.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/asked-answered-lawrence-weschler/

Judge Paul P. Biebel Jr. said that although the men had initially confessed in great detail, DNA recovered from semen in the victim’s body cast significant doubt on the confessions. DNA testing shortly after the murder excluded all four men. And last May, the DNA was matched to another suspect, Johnny Douglas, who had been convicted of a very similar rape and murder. The state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, who had opposed vacating the convictions, has three options: she can appeal the ruling, retry the men — Terrill Swift, Michael Saunders, Harold Richardson and Vincent Thames — or dismiss the charges.

But when the humiliated thief dives off a 400-foot-high bridge, apparently a suicide, Kinsey regrets her superior attitude and goes to work for the woman’s fiancé, trying to track down her criminal associates and find out who might have helped her off that bridge.

2011-11-17,On Composing for Kermit the Frog,"Before we get to the Flight of the Conchords or the tricky art of writing funny songs for beloved puppets to sing, we need to talk about Figwit. Because should you enter “Bret McKen­zie” into Google, you’ll find that the first suggested search is not, say, “Bret McKenzie Conchords” or even “Bret McKenzie Muppets” but “Bret McKenzie Lord of the Rings.” Intrigued, you will investigate further. And you will learn that McKenzie, a native New Zealander, had a three-second role as a nameless elf in “Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring” in 2001. (His father, Peter McKenzie, is a part-time actor who played a larger role in the film, as the human Elendil.) Furthermore, a sharp-eyed Israeli woman spotted the then-not-famous McKenzie and, smitten by his elfin beauty, dubbed him Figwit. (It’s an acronym for Frodo Is Great . . . Who Is That?!?? which she claims is a more or less accurate transcription of her original reaction to seeing the elf.) This woman then established a Web site, Figwitlives.net, dedicated to all things Figwittian. There were local news stories. There were roving bands of Tolkienites that trailed McKenzie to Conchords shows. There was even a tongue-in-cheek documentary created in part by McKenzie’s girlfriend (now his wife), Hannah Clarke, which contains this quote from Ian McKellen when asked about Figwit: “I do remember there were some very attractive young girls. Which one was he?” McKenzie explains the Figwit phenomenon like this: “My brother was also an extra. Basically all tall and skinny New Zealanders were elves in the film.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/magazine/bret-mckenzie-muppets.html

Umberto Eco’s latest fiction, “The Prague Cemetery,” is choreographed by a truth that is itself so strange a novelist need hardly expand on it to produce a wondrous tale. Eco forthrightly explains that all his major characters but one are historical figures; but a reader unaware of how close to the truth Eco is hewing might be inclined to award him more points for inventiveness than he earns. This is not to say that Eco doesn’t earn points for inventiveness, nor that a novel can’t succeed on other grounds.

Above all, there are the law-enforcement and institutional investigations into what happened over the last dozen-plus years. Then there’s the journalistic impulse to cast a now-darker eye over past events, both small and innocent as well as large and iniquitous. In that first category, some of those lesser moments were themselves journalistic ones. There’s Jack McCallum’s 1999 Sports Illustrated profile of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach accused of molesting several young boys, which McCallum returned to last week on SI.com. Bill Lyon’s column about Sandusky that same year in The Philadelphia Inquirer, which Josh Levin reconsiders at Slate.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/rereading-joe-paterno-2004-edition/

2011-11-18,Photo Graphic,"It’s not often that pieces from a designer’s collection end up in a gallery before they make it into stores, but such is the case for the designer Dries Van Noten. An exhibition that opened in Vienna yesterday, and that will later travel to Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris, features a selection from Van Noten’s spring 2012 collection alongside photographs by the London-born artist James Reeve that inspired them. Among the pieces are Reeve’s photo of buildings in La Rouviere, a housing complex in Marseille, and the shirt that Van Noten applied it to. “I liked the mystery, the lights at night, the moment of wonder, where you’re questioning what’s happening on the other side of the windows,” says Van Noten of the image. Reeve, too, considers the picture quite voyeuristic. “It’s like 1,000 small colorful television screens all lined up in rows on the hillside,” he says. “I have often seen people peering into the windows, trying to discover what kind of activity is going on inside.” Other pieces on view with their corresponding photographs include Van Noten’s bridge shift and “Circus, Circus” top. “I’m used to seeing my work as two-dimensional,” Reeve says. “It was inspiring to see Dries translate it into dynamic forms –– the way the ruffle skirts seem to almost play with the lights as they move, the colored crystals that he sewed into the windows of La Rouviere. I thought that was a really beautiful idea.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/photo-graphic/

At 9.52 a.m. on Wednesday Abhishek broke the news on Twitter and immediately, the social networking site went into overdrive with other celebrities (Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar, Javed Akhtar) congratulating the family and discussing her cute-quotient (director Ram Gopal Varma tweeted “I just hope that she has more Aishwarya than Abhishek”).

In early November, the Broadcast Editors’ Association had circulated an internal memo dictating conduct for coverage of the birth (guidelines included that the story would not be treated as breaking news and no cameras or broadcast vans would be sent to the hospital). Television channels stuck to the code and both Bachchans – Amitabh and Abhishek – thanked the media (on Twitter again) for respecting the family’s privacy.

The episodes are to start appearing on the service in 2013. “Bringing a series back from cancellation almost never happens, but then, ‘Arrested’ always was about as unconventional as they get, so it seems totally appropriate that this show that broke the mold is smashing it to pieces once again,” the founders of Imagine, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, said in a statement. Streaming episodes of the critically acclaimed show have remained popular among Netflix subscribers, giving the company the confidence to make more. Netflix did not say how many episodes it had ordered or whether the original cast members, like Will Arnett, above, had signed up for the revival.

Regarding the latter, the cut is slouchy sexy and thoughtfully undone. Tamborello says: “We ask ourselves, ‘Can we picture our clothes on every character? Will they age beautifully with her?’ ” Stores like Barneys New York and Ikram in Chicago sure think so. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/true-romance/

2011-11-22,Dispute Over Money Delays 9/11 Museum,"The scheduled opening next year of the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been delayed because of a $156 million dispute between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation responsible for running the museum, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Port Authority, which is responsible for the construction, has stopped approving new contracts, slowing work on the underground museum, which was to open on Sept. 11. The organizations have been arguing over the money for nearly 18 months, and tensions rose recently as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has sought to exert more control over construction projects in the city. Last month Mr. Cuomo nominated one of his deputies, Patrick Foye, to run the Port Authority and asked the agency to take over the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a joint city and state enterprise that has been working on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation, whose chairman is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has maintained that poor management and delays by the Port Authority between 2006 and 2008 cost it more than $100 million. The delay in approving construction contracts was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Michael Frazier, the foundation’s communications director, said Monday, “We are working with the leadership of the Port Authority to come to an immediate resolution that allows this historic project to move forward.” Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said, “We’re working cooperatively with New York City and the memorial foundation” and that “work is continuing.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/arts/design/dispute-over-money-delays-9-11-museum.html

All you need to know about Arsenal, which has won five Premier League matches in a row, and has dragged itself all the way from 19th after three matches up to seventh, level on points with Chelsea and Liverpool above them, is defined by the winning goal Robin van Persie scored in Saturday’s match at Norwich. Aaron Ramsey won the ball in midfield and was tripped, ending up on his stomach. Alex Song, who had an otherwise desultory, wasteful match, hurdled the prone Ramsey and advanced rapidly. He had Gervinho, streaking alone on the left, and van Persie, between two defenders on the right. He twitched, almost passing the ball to Gervinho, the lively Ivoirian who had already missed three sitters in the match, then changed his tune, rotated his body to pick out van Persie, who touched once, ran into space, and on his second touch lifted the ball over John Ruddy with his right foot, his weaker one, and just inside the near post.",Sports,https://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/robin-van-persie-is-britains-best-striker-discuss/

President Obama said his jobs plan was for people who believed “if you worked hard and played by the rules, you would be rewarded.” Mitt Romney explained his goal was to restore hope for “folks who grew up believing that if they played by the rules . . . they would have the chance to build a good life.” But these days, many workers have lost a near guarantee on a decent wage and benefits — and their careers are likely to have much more volatility (great years; bad years; confusing, mediocre years) than their parents’ ever did.

2011-11-23,"Breakfast Meeting, Nov. 23","The Tribune Company, which is trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection, agreed to pay its former chief executive, Randy Michaels, $675,000 in a settlement stemming from his abrupt resignation from the company last year, The Chicago Tribune reported. The company will also cover $50,000 in Mr. Michaels’s legal fees. Mr. Michaels resigned under pressure, following reporting in The New York Times that detailed numerous instances of outlandish, often sexual behavior by Mr. Michaels and other top executives. The Tribune reported that he had demanded $900,000, the pro-rated portion of his 2010 management bonus, arguing that he “was effectively ‘terminated without cause,’ which would trigger the payment under terms of the bonus plan.” The payment needs to be approved by a bankruptcy court judge.In Tuesday night’s Republican presidential debate on CNN, which was devoted to national security issues, The Caucus live blog took note of the higher profile of Representative Ron Paul, the libertarian from Texas, who often can be hard to spot at these seemingly weekly encounters. As Trip Gabriel wrote for The Caucus, Mr. Paul’s campaign “had claimed after the last debate hosted by CBS News that he got only 90 seconds of air time,” but Tuesday night he played a more central role, serving as a dramatic foil to his rivals. He clashed with Newt Gingrich over the the Patriot Act, and Rick Santorum over profiling of travelers, including Muslims.",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/breakfast-meeting-nov-23/

He played the Beethoven from memory, but for the Mozart, he used an iPad instead of a conventional score.

But because the analysand, a young Russian woman named Sabina Spielrein, is played by the lovely Keira Knightley, her mental-health issues are therefore interesting, just as they were when the sufferer was Ginger Rogers (“Lady in the Dark”), Olivia de Havilland (“The Snake Pit”), Joanne Woodward (“The Three Faces of Eve”), Tippi Hedren (“Marnie”), Catherine Deneuve (“Repulsion”), Gena Rowlands (“A Woman Under the Influence”), Isabelle Adjani (“The Story of Adele H.”), Liv Ullmann (“Face to Face”), Jessica Lange (“Frances”), Naomi Watts (“Mulholland Drive”) or Natalie Portman (“Black Swan”).

2011-11-24,France: Noriega to Be Extradited," A Paris court on Wednesday approved the extradition of Panama’s onetime dictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega, left, to his homeland, clearing the way for his return after two decades in French and American prisons. Prime Minister François Fillon of France signed an extradition order for Mr. Noriega, 77, earlier this year, but a date of departure has not been determined, officials said. Panamanian courts have convicted Mr. Noriega in absentia in connection with the killing of political opponents, as well as on charges of embezzlement and corruption. He faces three 20-year prison terms in Panama, which he ruled from 1983 until 1989, when he was ousted by an American invasion. Convicted in a United States court in 1992 on charges including drug trafficking, Mr. Noriega was imprisoned in Florida before his extradition to France last year. A French judge sentenced him to seven years in prison on charges that he laundered $3 million in Colombian drug money through international banks and into French accounts in the late 1980s. The Panamanian president, Ricardo Martinelli, has vowed that Mr. Noriega will serve his Panamanian sentences in prison, and not under house arrest, despite his age and reported ill health, according to The Associated Press. The A.P. also quoted Mr. Noriega as telling the court through an interpreter: “I want to return to Panama and prove my innocence.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/world/europe/french-court-approves-noriega-extradition-to-panama.html

The authors say the drawings are “a direct and powerful representation of a radical and dramatic movement of rebellion.” The art depicts Mr. Lydon and other members of the band, including Sid Vicious and their manager, Malcolm McLaren.

2011-11-25,So Much Depends,"William CARLOS WILLIAMS was a furious poetic revolutionary — furiously working over a lifetime to reinvent American poetry, furious at poetry he considered backward, and at critics and editors who didn’t get it. To many, including me, he was the greatest poet of the 20th century. Unlike Eliot and Pound, two of his rivals in importance, he refused to be an expatriate. When Pound wrote him from overseas, urging Williams to leave America, Williams incorporated the advice into a brutally terse and powerful poem in praise of staying home. He spent virtually all his life in Rutherford, N.J., close to the American voices that enthralled him. He was determined to make them the basis of a new poetic diction, one that has hugely influenced American poets and poetries since. It’s not too much to say he was our Dante, making a distinctively American language out of slang, jokes, complaints and rants. Williams did this by endlessly reworking heavily enjambed line breaks and stanza breaks in exquisitely casual and deceptively ordinary poems — a red wheelbarrow shining after a rainstorm, a fire engine tearing through city streets, a woman whose body is covered with moles. He did this alone, and largely ignored by the mediocre stars of American literary life. His capacious, rigorously humane work has a delicacy of ear that hasn’t yet been surpassed. All this, and poetry was his night job — his days were spent as hardworking Dr. Williams of North Jersey.

2011-11-25,A Good Run,"This is a difficult time in which to present an account — and what amounts to a defense — of the West’s rise to pre-eminence and its unequaled influence in shaping the world today. The West is on the defensive, challenged economically by the ascent of China and politically and militarily by a wave of Islamist hatred. Perhaps as great a challenge is internal. The study of Western civilization, which dominated American education after World War II, has long been under attack, and is increasingly hard to find in our schools and colleges. When it is treated at all, the West is maligned because of its history of slavery and imperialism, an alleged addiction to war and its exclusion of women and nonwhites from its rights and privileges. Some criticize its study as narrow, limiting, arrogant and discriminatory, asserting that it has little or no value for those of non-European origins. Or it is said to be of interest chiefly as a horrible example.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/civilization-the-west-and-the-rest-by-niall-ferguson-book-review.html

2011-11-25,Two Brains Running,"In 2002, Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel in economic science. What made this unusual is that Kahneman is a psychologist. Specifically, he is one-half of a pair of psychologists who, beginning in the early 1970s, set out to dismantle an entity long dear to economic theorists: that arch-rational decision maker known as Homo economicus. The other half of the dismantling duo, Amos Tversky, died in 1996 at the age of 59. Had Tversky lived, he would certainly have shared the Nobel with Kahneman, his longtime collaborator and dear friend.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html
2011-11-25,Get Stuffed | A Cup o’ Pumpkin Pie,"Before you devour your second (third?) slice of Mom’s leftover homemade pumpkin pie, opt for a still seasonal but healthy alternative: an organic, sugar-free pumpkin pie smoothie. Created by Dr. Frank Lipman, the founder and director of the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in Manhattan — which promotes “good medicine,” like lifestyle changes through diet, nutrition, exercise and stress management — this dessert complies with his challenging but not impossible 14-day-long “Be Well” food-and-shake cleanse ($200). The gluten-free treat substitutes unsweetened vanilla almond milk for cream and calls for organic pumpkin and a little raw honey or cinnamon in place of sugar. “When you eat sugars, your body gets an initial surge of energy, your body scrambles to process it, and then you crash,” Lipman says about sugar, a depression-linked carbohydrate. “This process triggers the body to crave more sugar, and a vicious cycle of craving, eating and crashing begins.” Sounds alarmingly familiar, eh? On the bright side, Lipman does promote a lot of sleep to combat sugar cravings around the holidays. The easy-to-follow recipe is below, so you can nap and have all the taste of pumpkin pie you want this holiday season.Pumpkin Pie Smoothie – Serves 1",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/get-stuffed-a-cup-o-pumpkin-pie/

2011-11-25,Inconspicuous Consumption,"“No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money,” Samuel Johnson declared. As the Internet is destroying the business model that has historically supported high-quality journalism, movies, music and television, the conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is that Johnson was wrong. “Information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower,” technology activists have insisted, selectively quoting the technology thinker Stewart Brand. (In fact, Brand said in the same 1984 speech that on the other hand, “information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable.”) According to the worldview embodied by Google and Facebook and many of the best minds in the legal academy and public-­interest community, the culture business is collapsing because the old-style media executives who run Hollywood, cable television, the record companies and newspapers have failed to adjust to the expectations of a demanding new generation of media consumers who want free movies and books and music and news wherever and whenever they’re online.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/free-ride-by-robert-levine-book-review.html

2011-11-25,Inside the List,"HIS AND HERS: Most weeks, the hawkish and the mawkish coexist peacefully on the fiction list: it’s not hard to picture an old married couple retiring to bed with separate but equal best sellers by, say, Daniel Silva and Danielle Steel. It’s a comfortable state of affairs, and one that’s pretty much guaranteed to drive you bonkers if you’re an adman-turned-novelist who wants your work in the hands of every man, woman and child on earth — if you are, for instance, James Patterson, the world’s most successful author of adult fiction (according to Guinness) and “the smartest marketing guy I ever met” (according to a tribute on Patterson’s Web site). Patterson was chairman of the J. Walter Thompson ad agency for six years, and you can just see him scrutinizing that old couple in their flannel pajamas: how do I reach both of them? For Patterson, the answer since 2001 has been to write (or co-write) romances as well as the action-packed thrillers that made him famous. And it’s worked. In June 2008, Patterson scored simultaneous best sellers with the suspense novel “Sail” and the romance “Sundays at Tiffany’s.” This week he does it again, as “Kill Alex Cross,” the latest entry in his signature detective series, storms the hardcover fiction list at No. 1, and his romance novel “The Christmas Wedding” holds strong at No. 9 in its fifth week.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The new policy is the latest in a series of moves by the agency to tighten restrictions on television. In October, it announced limits on entertainment shows broadcast nationwide during primetime hours.

2011-11-29,"Breakfast Meeting, Nov. 29","The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, whose campaign had already been stung by accusations of sexual harassment, was confronted with allegations on Monday that he carried on a 13-year affair with an Atlanta businesswoman. Because the story broke while Mr. Cain was live on CNN’s “The Situation Room,” he responded to the allegations by the woman, Ginger White, before they had actually aired on the Fox affiliate in Atlanta, WAGA-TV. According to The Huffington Post, the allegations “didn’t come up during Cain’s first segment with anchor Wolf Blitzer. That’s because Blitzer didn’t know about them either when the two men sat down.” During that first segment of three, CNN producers began to see posts to Twitter that mentioned the coming WAGA story. “While seated during a commercial break, Blitzer then asked Cain about the Atlanta report and the candidate acknowledged that his campaign had been contacted about it and would be willing to discuss it on air,” Michael Calderone of The Huffington Post reported.

When I encountered it for the first time, years ago, just out of college, I felt a race of fury over the liberties and licenses Hollywood had taken in its rendering. Holly’s profession is hardly glossed over in the novel, and her neighbor, the book’s unnamed narrator, does not and cannot provide her with a happy ending. I’m interested in hearing from all of you, but especially from those who have just read the book for the first time, presumably after some familiarity with the iconic film.

2011-11-30,U.S. to Take Over Orchestra’s Pensions,"A federal bankruptcy judge has agreed to let the federal government take over the Philadelphia Orchestra’s pension plans, saying the orchestra was unlikely to survive if it tried to keep running them itself. The two pension plans, one for musicians and the other for staff members, cover about 200 people. Some musicians are likely to have their pensions reduced after the takeover. Although the government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures defined-benefit pensions, its insurance is limited. In the past symphony orchestras competed for and retained top talent by promising generous pensions, so musicians with many years in the Philadelphia Orchestra probably have earned benefits above the insurance limit. The orchestra, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, had asked for the government’s help with its pensions, saying that it could not raise money if donors thought their dollars might end up in a troubled pension fund. The pension funds are set up in a way that makes the orchestra bear all the investment risk. When the orchestra emerges from bankruptcy its musicians and staff members will have retirement plans under which they bear the investment risk.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/arts/music/us-to-take-over-orchestras-pensions.html

Like any good activist, Norquist is a monomaniac about his issue: Everything in American politics revolves around taxes, all good things flow from tax cuts, no deal that increases taxes can ever benefit America, etc. etc. As I said at AEI, I think this view is mistaken, and that focusing obsessively on tax rates has proven to be an insufficient and even counterproductive strategy for actually limiting the size and scope of government. (Steven Hayward elaborates a bit on this argument in his recent essay on conservatism’s intellectual blind spots.) And worse, because taxpayers are liable for tomorrow’s debts as well as today’s tax rates, even the pledge’s present success at keeping rates relatively low may look like a pyrrhic victory in the long run.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/in-praise-of-grover-norquist/

2011-11-30,Vain Glorious | Tenoverten’s New Nail Polish,"Nadine Ferber and Adair Ilyinsky, the co-owners of Tenoverten, the stylish TriBeCa nail salon, were inspired by client feedback when concocting the formula for their new polish collection, and since their client list is filled with fashion-world heavies who know their Peridot from their Bordeaux, the partners couldn’t have asked for a better focus group. “People love certain aspects of different polishes,” Ferber says, pointing out that some of her customers choose Essie because it lasts the longest, while others rave about Chanel’s color choices. “It became about how to meld the best of everything into one product,” Ilyinsky says. After months of research in the field, the duo nailed their first six shades, which are named after streets in downtown Manhattan. A bright blue polish called “Commerce” was inspired by the West Village street where Ferber’s clothing boutique, Mick Margo, is located. “Church” is a burnt red alternative to Wicked (a popular Essie shade), and Reade, a metallic charcoal, was named for the salon’s home base. With its five-free formula (no formaldehyde resin, camphor, formaldehyde, toluene or dibutyl phthalate) and easy-to-hold brush (the salon’s technicians work from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., so a little attention to ergonomic detail was in order), this new polish deserves a big hand.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/vain-glorious-tenovertens-new-nail-polish/

But I did think this comment from Brad DeLong raised some interesting issues. He’s objecting to the idea, raised by Ferguson’s book and emphasized by Donald Kagan’s Times review, that European colonialists did good as well as evil, and that the Western imperialist project has to be credited with positive legacies as well as with grave crimes.
