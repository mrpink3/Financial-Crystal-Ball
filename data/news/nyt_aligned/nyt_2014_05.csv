The resulting album, “For Emma, Forever Ago,” earned Vernon widespread acclaim, but instead of taking his newfound fame elsewhere, he set up April Base Studios, which has served as an incubator for the state’s emerging indie music scene. That includes Bon Iver’s drummer, S. Carey (above left), whose gorgeous sophomore album, “Range of Light,” was released last month; the Milwaukee-based folk outfit Field Report, led by the singer-songwriter Chris Porterfield (above right); and Phox, a six-piece indie pop group from Baraboo, Wis., whose self-titled debut is out next month. Despite a growing profile and their home state’s reputation as a harbinger of hipster culture (see: Pabst Blue Ribbon, artisanal cheese, taxidermy), the musicians insist that what makes them distinctly Wisconsin is their obliviousness to being cool. “A lot of us were in the marching band,” Phox frontwoman Monica Martin says. “It’s sort of a rite of passage.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/wisconsin-rock-bon-iver-april-base-studios-s-carey-field-report-phox/

Indeed, this coral archipelago in the Indian Ocean, 23 miles off the eastern coast of Tanzania, still has many of the features that it did when it was an important trading center and its historic Stone Town served as the capital of an Omani sultanate. Zanzibar’s largest island, Unguja, is home to most of the cultural attractions, many of them found in beguiling Stone Town, which was awarded Unesco World Heritage status in 2000. In recent years, there’s been a concerted effort to restore and give new life to the city’s distinctive structures. Palaces have been turned into museums and cultural centers, and grand Swahili mansions have been reborn as restaurants and boutique hotels. Yet the coast still offers the “delicious view” that the explorer Sir Richard Burton recorded, of a “cocoa-fringed shore of purest white, and the sea blue as a slab of lapis lazuli.” (Note: Prices in Zanzibar are routinely quoted in dollars — alongside, or occasionally instead of, the island’s official currency, the Tanzanian shilling.)",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/travel/36-hours-in-zanzibar-tanzania.html

A hundred kilometers into the atmosphere, that’s where it was headed, a new step forward in African space travel.” After a few moments, though, “the rocket listed, cut a neat arc to the left and landed a few hundred meters away, in the valley of the Luvua, where it exploded.” For David Van Reybrouck the rocket represents Mobutu’s regime: “A parabola of soot. . . .

But Vassell has lately gone independent — she left Pace in 2012 to found Concept NV, which she describes as an art ideation lab — and it’s clear she’s got more pressing social concerns on her mind. “Activism is important to me,” she says. “I find that sometimes the art world is too busy with its art-world view to consider that.” Her latest show, “Black Eye,” underscores the continuing need for increased diversity in a still narrow art world.

The reported activities at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri near North Korea’s western border with China come amid fears that the North may be preparing for another nuclear test. In recent days, more activity has been reported at an underground nuclear test site in Punggye-ri in northeastern North Korea. The website, 38 North, which is run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said its analysis of satellite images of Tongchang-ri showed that North Korea conducted “one and maybe more engine tests of what is probably the first stage of a KN-08 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile” in late March to early April. “With this latest activity, three KN-08 rocket engine test series have been identified for the first and possibly second stages dating back to mid-2013,” the website said. “As this effort progresses, the next technically logical step in the missile’s development would be a flight test of the entire system.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/world/asia/north-korea-activity-at-a-missile-site.html

Almost a third of the city’s population fled after the closures, along with the pop stars, the bowling association and, most crushingly, LeBron.

2014-05-02,Gomorrah by the Bay,"Emma Donoghue’s novel “Room,” published in 2010, was rightly celebrated for its terse depiction of love in a dark place. Narrated by a small boy, it’s a claustrophobic and sparsely furnished exercise in horror and redemption. A mother and her young son, held captive for years in a locked room, do not go mad and destroy each other. Instead they make a sort of world, a private civilization of tenderness and warmth, population two. The novel is a triumph of the obsessed imagination thriving on a real paucity of resources.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/books/review/emma-donoghues-frog-music.html
2014-05-02,Train of Jewels,"In 2005, the settlement of a notorious case of postwar liability took place in a federal court in Florida. Sixty years previously, the so-called Hungarian Gold Train had arrived near Salzburg, Austria, bearing property requisitioned by the Nazis from Hungary’s estimated 800,000 Jewish citizens. Making its way to Germany as the Allies closed in, the train was intercepted by the Americans. Some of its cargo — jewelry, glassware, carpets, bed linen, cutlery, furs, furniture, gold coins, watches and much else from households whose occupants had vanished into the concentration camps — was subsequently commandeered by the generals working on the Marshall Plan, who needed to furnish their headquarters. Numerous items were irretrievably lost, never to be seen again by their rightful owners or by their owners’ heirs. It would take more than half a century for Hungarian survivors of the Holocaust to settle a lawsuit that eventually granted $21 million as compensation to a number of Jewish social service agencies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/books/review/love-and-treasure-by-ayelet-waldman.html

2014-05-02,Inside the List,"Je Ne Sais Quoi: “Everybody’s Got Something,” a new memoir by the “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts, makes its debut on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 3. Roberts’s book is like one of those packets of heavily sweetened instant oatmeal — you can pretend it’s healthy even as you search out the sugar bombs of drama (her medical crises, her mother’s death, her ratings war with the “Today” show) and celebrity gossip (her 10-year relationship with the girlfriend she met on a blind date: “I liked the fact that she had no idea who I was”). Roberts delivers all of this in the soothing, upbeat voice that has made her so formidable a presence on morning TV. “I’m no Pollyanna,” she says in the current issue of Good Housekeeping, “but I believe optimism is a choice — a muscle that gets stronger with use. Right foot, left foot . . . just keep moving.” This spirit of levelheaded resolve is widely credited with helping Roberts topple “Today” from its perch in 2012. But she almost didn’t get the chance. “She was a woman of great personal dignity, stately beauty and, what’s most important in her mysterious genre, a certain je ne sais quoi that you can’t just order up by the ounce from human resources,” the media reporter Brian Stelter wrote of Roberts in “Top of the Morning,” his 2013 best seller about the competition for breakfast-hour viewers. “Naturally, because morning TV still comes down to a group of elite men trying to guess the needs of a mass audience of mostly women, many of the powers that were at ABC wanted to fire her” as soon as feasible.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Using the pseudonymous case of “Lily,” a single mom for whom the father of her baby, “Carl,” is more a burden than a helper, they argue that it’s often much more sensible for women who want children to get pregnant and raise them on their own than to hold out for a decent, productive, reliable man who may never actually materialize:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/making-men-marriageable/

Fred Dixon, the chief executive of NYC & Company, the city’s marketing and tourism organization, says Brazilians average about a week per visit; a few who were in town last month can be seen on the following pages. Because of sky-high taxes on imported goods in Brazil, many there find that shopping sprees in New York can pay for themselves. “They’re creating a love affair with New York,” Dixon says, adding that the high-fashion, celebrity-oriented culture in the city “fits right in” with their lifestyle. “They feel at home here.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/where-brazilians-go-to-splurge.html

Clark started out as a maker of geometric abstractions under the influences of Klee, Mondrian and Léger. In the 1960s she was associated with Neo-Concretism, the Brazilian movement that insisted on the sensual and material — as opposed to intellectual — properties of paintings and sculpture, sometimes encouraging viewer interaction with objects and installations. After 1966, Clark claimed to have abandoned art. She shifted her approach away from creating conventional forms and toward a kind of art therapy that involved the application of materials and devices directly to the people’s bodies. Art was treated as a form of psychological healing. Her late works should be of particular interest to fans of socially engaged and otherwise participatory types of art making.

Through these surveys, we hope to change the shortsighted lens through which apologies are typically viewed. People review them as theatrical performances for a few days and quickly forget about them. Instead, as I’ve argued before, we ought to track the apologizer’s behavior over time to see whether he or she has genuinely committed to a new course of action, which is why we are offering these surveys.

This intimate, lo-fi approach is characteristic of the soft-spoken singer-songwriter’s work. Her first EP, last year’s “Skisser” (Swedish for “sketches”), earned raves for its minimal arrangements and simple, heartbreaking lyrics. She tried to capture the same magic with “EP II,” cutting more tracks at home and, at one point, holing up in a cabin in the Swedish woods to record her ethereal sounds. The rustic setting — Boman says she had to trek to a neighbor’s to fetch water each day — proved a fitting backdrop for the 26-year-old’s elegiac, if oddly uplifting, tunes. “It was beautiful,” she says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/alice-boman-sweden-singer-songwriter-new-song-over/

Arrogant, suave and irresistible to women, James Simon (also played by Eisenberg) glides into Simon’s life, throwing light on his weaknesses and self-loathing, and preying on his love interest Hannah (played by Mia Wasikowska). Nothing ever seems to go right for Simon, while everything is perfect for James. Based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s novella, the story delves into questions of identity, psychosis and self-preservation with absurd and sometimes agonizing humor. A seasoned comedian, the British director can draw a link between Dostoyevsky’s piercing insight and Larry David’s brazen style: “He’s really willing to go to un-noble places in people.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/richard-ayoade-the-double-jesse-eisenberg/

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But what really drives the movie is its own search for something to make fun of, and for a comic style that can feel credibly naughty while remaining ultimately safe and affirmative.” Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play the Fitzgeralds, R.V. enthusiasts with a teenage daughter who “are beyond square, which is to say that they are stranger, kinkier and more interestingly individual” than the Millers — and funnier as actors, too — Mr. Scott added. “A movie about the Fitzgeralds would have been more rewarding than ‘We’re the Millers,’ and also much riskier.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2014-05-05,What’s On Sunday,"9 P.M. (Discovery) EVEREST AVALANCHE TRAGEDY On April 18 an NBC News team waited at the base camp on Mount Everest as it prepared to produce “Everest Jump Live,” a special about the climber Joby Ogwyn’s attempt to make the first wing-suit flight off the 29,029-foot summit of the world’s tallest mountain. That morning an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall, killing 13 Sherpa guides and leaving three missing — the highest death toll in a single day in the mountain’s history. This documentary covers the weeks leading up to the tragedy and the subsequent rescue and recovery efforts through real-time film footage and witness accounts. Among those interviewed are Mr. Ogwyn, above; Garrett Madison, the expedition leader; and Todd Burleson, the president of Alpine Ascents International, which lost five guides. It also pays tribute to the Sherpas and their families; the network will make a contribution to the American Himalayan Foundation’s Sherpa Family Fund, from which all donations will flow to relatives of the deceased.

Leo would plunk down near whatever caught his eye and begin to sketch, while his father stealthily captured the moment. Kaufman says the activity — whether sprawling out in front of a Jasper Johns painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art (middle left), or carefully copying Chris Burden’s tower of concrete bags at the New Museum (bottom center) — has nurtured Leo’s love for drawing. Still, he hesitates to interpret the 5-year-old’s curiosity as a sign of future art stardom. “He’s got a limited attention span,” Kaufman says. “He does the drawing and then he says, ‘Let’s go have lunch.'” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/dean-kaufman-photographs-his-son-at-art-shows/

It’s like making a movie and filming multiple endings.” His efforts are showcased in his new book, “Tertium Quid” ($75), due out later this month in a limited print run.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/t-magazine/murray-moss-tertium-quid-book-hauser-wirth.html

(Starz Cinema) ANIMAL KINGDOM (2010) A bleached-blond mama lion (Jacki Weaver, above, with Sullivan Stapleton) with piercing blue eyes and a glinting smile and her brood of armed robbers and drug dealers (Luke Ford, Mr. Stapleton and Ben Mendelsohn) take on rogue cops in Melbourne in this directorial and screenwriting debut from David Michôd. But then a police sergeant (Guy Pearce) on the right side of the law interrogates her grandson (James Frecheville), who has been thrown into the fray after his mother dies of a heroin overdose, and plants the seeds of distrust that force him to fight to save himself. “The film’s depiction of the raw fear lurking below the brothers’ braggadocio is the most pronounced emotion in a movie whose focus on the personalities of its criminals suggests an Australian answer to ‘Goodfellas,’ minus the wiseguy humor,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The relative absence of gun battles and car chases helps ‘Animal Kingdom’ build and sustain a mood of deepening dread.

Noémie Lvovsky portrays the queen’s lady-in-waiting; Virginie Ledoyen is the woman rumored to be the queen’s lover. “If the rules and the players of this continuing, increasingly dangerous court intrigue remain obscure, it’s because ‘Farewell, My Queen’ is told through Sidonie’s eyes,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Tapping her palace sources, notably an archivist (Michel Robin) and a dressmaker (Anne Benoît), Sidonie learns of news known only to the nobility and their trusted stewards: that the Bastille has been seized.” Mr. Jacquot, she added, “has always been a sensitive director of actresses, his sympathies evident in his caressing, sometimes ogling camerawork and the time and space he gives women and their stories. That sympathy is evident here too, though crucially, while he doesn’t demonize Marie Antoinette, he doesn’t turn her into a spurious feminist martyr.” In French, with English subtitles.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

2014-05-07,Feeling For | Decadent Cashmere Blankets With a Planet-Friendly Pedigree,"Just how much good karma can be packed into a single home accessory? Quite a bit, as evidenced by a new series of limited-edition cashmere blankets made by Jane Palmer of Noon Design Studio — the fashion industry’s eminent natural dye house, which is also known for its popular indigo kits and decorative housewares — and the artist Christy Matson. Carpet-thick yet feather-light, the blankets are hand-loomed by Matson in Los Angeles on the same jacquard machine she uses in her fine-art practice. The lofty cashmere yarn is not only hand-twisted by members of a women’s cooperative in Afghanistan, but also — two degrees of virtuousness — sourced directly from fashion houses that would otherwise have discarded it. The rich, variegated colors are hand-dyed by Palmer using flowers, leaves and minerals; the jet-black hue comes from a dye recipe of roots, bark and indigo that dates back to medieval times. Each is one of a kind; custom designs are also available by special order. Palmer and Matson have set aside a small number of the blankets for T readers, and can ship overnight — just in time for a (very decadent) last-minute Mother’s Day gift.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/feeling-for-decadent-cashmere-blankets-with-a-planet-friendly-pedigree/

2014-05-07,What Health Insurance Might Do,"Alert (or at least health-care-obsessed) readers have no doubt been following the coverage of a new study on mortality in Massachusetts in the years following Romneycare’s coverage expansion, the gist of which — the authors found a striking, Massachusetts-specific decline in death rates for the non-elderly — tends to confirm liberal assumptions about the benefits of health insurance, and undercut the conservative and libertarian argument that insurance doesn’t have the impact on health and mortality that most people expect. The study’s findings are an almost-diametrical reversal of the results from Oregon’s Medicaid experiment, which were much discussed around this time last year (here’s my contribution), and which seemed to strengthen the conservative critique of Obamacare’s pursuit of comprehensive coverage. So now it’s liberalism’s turn to claim vindication, and to press Obamacare’s critics to give ground in the debate.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/what-health-insurance-might-do/

His writing has a patient, deliberate quality that is rare at a moment when the dominant medium of architectural discourse is Twitter. Perhaps this is why Mr. Rybczynski, despite himself, is suddenly all the rage. On May 1 he was named a “Design Mind” by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in its annual National Design Awards, an honor generally bestowed on visionary thinkers.

Colen came to prominence as a member of the Irak crew, a posse of graffiti writers, artists, pranksters and drug users that also included Ryan McGinley and the late Dash Snow. Those formative years are central to “Help,” Colen’s new retrospective at the Brant Foundation in Greenwich, Conn., which opens this Monday. “There’s been an arc in my work and an arc in my life,” says Colen, who still maintains a punkish air, but is now a monied property owner (of a fully operational farm in Pine Plains, N.Y.) with close relationships to art-world power players like Peter Brant, Charles Saatchi, Jeffrey Deitch and Larry Gagosian.

The clanging of dishes interrupted us midsentence, and occasionally, a baby wailed from the other side of the room. It was the type of environment my mother and I avoid with precision, and yet, there we were, regaling in Mother’s Day splendor with all the other people who mistakenly felt obligated to eat out.",U.S.,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/a-mothers-instinct-a-daughters-need/

2014-05-09,Cradle of Civil Disobedience,"At the end of the 19th century, Mohandas Gandhi was a young lawyer living in Durban, South Africa. He left his house in Beach Grove every morning for an office on Mercury Lane, where he spent much of the day helping his fellow Indian immigrants navigate the onerous colonial bureaucracy. He kept meticulous records, including a logbook of correspondence — from an English missionary and local planters, and a series of letters exchanged with the Protector of Indian Immigrants about the treatment of indentured laborers. In January of 1897, and again a few months later, he heard from another lawyer who was, like him, a Gujarati who had studied in England and then struggled to establish a practice in Bombay. The contents of these letters are unknown. In a remarkable new biography, “Gandhi Before India,” Ramachandra Guha gingerly speculates about what they might have been. Expressions of support for Gandhi’s nascent activism? Or perhaps “explorations of interest in a possible career in South Africa”? Guha wisely stops there. What is not in doubt is the name in Gandhi’s logbook — “M. A. Jinnah,” Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would become the founder of Pakistan. “All we now know is that, a full 50 years before partition and the independence of India and Pakistan, the respective ‘Fathers’ of those nations were in correspondence.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/books/review/gandhi-before-india-by-ramachandra-guha.html

Jerry Brown and state legislative leaders reached a deal Thursday to place a revised plan for a rainy-day fund on the ballot this fall; it would create a cushion against future economic downturns and allow the state to use extra cash to pay down long-term debt. Mr. Brown, who is running for his fourth term this fall, has been pushing for the measure, which he says is the only way to bolster the state’s finances for the long term. Under the plan, spikes in money collected from capital gains taxes would be diverted to the fund, with some money set aside for debt payments on pensions. The Legislature would also be required to set aside 1.5 percent of general revenue for the fund each year, and money could be withdrawn from the fund only if overall revenue did not meet historic spending levels. The Legislature is expected to approve the proposal next week so that the measure can be placed on the November ballot.

Barbara Kingsolver on Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Signature of All Things.” Or we group a few books together, as we did last week with three biographies about James Madison, John Quincy Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams.Occasionally, we run a theme issue, like one we did in April on money or one last year that looked at writing about sex. This week, we did something slightly different. While we didn’t create an entire issue around a theme, we decided to highlight six new books on the cover that took on the subcontinent as their subject matter.

There is little nostalgia among the Irish for handball alleys, O Halloran says. “I don’t think people would value them the way they value a traditional cottage, old crosses or ancient ruins,” he says. “A lot of people see them as eyesores.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/magazine/three-walls-in-search-of-a-ball.html

2014-05-09,Addict. Informant. Mother.,"One day last summer, Ann and her husband, Tom, walked two and a half hours to reach Hazleton, a onetime mining town in eastern Pennsylvania. They had lived there until July, when they were evicted and moved in with Ann’s mother in Sugarloaf, a more affluent township nearby. There was not much to miss about Hazleton, with its decaying downtown and its fading homes spotted with satellite dishes, but to Ann and Tom the town held a shimmering appeal: It had heroin, a lot of it. They had called the usual friends for a ride, with no luck, and their own car had been repossessed. So at midday, the two left Ann’s mother’s condominium by foot and followed the asphalt out of the valley all the way to Hazleton. Eventually they turned onto Alter Street, where, especially in summer, heroin dealers greeted customers outside a packed barbershop and a busy pawnshop, clustering around them, competing for business. Sometimes Ann and Tom joined other users they knew behind a building, where someone had left a tattered couch. Sometimes they got high in an abandoned garage on a side street. Though the walk that day to Alter Street was long, it was worth it to them both: Tom, especially, loved heroin, and Ann loved Tom, and the march to Hazleton was as much about need as it was about love.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/magazine/addict-informant-mother.html

A patrolman ought to have a “nonlethal” way to incapacitate a criminal, one that worked quickly and with little risk of lasting injury. “For example,” the study’s authors wrote, “darts have been used for injecting tranquilizing drugs into animals.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/magazine/who-made-that-stun-gun.html

2014-05-09,Unfrozen,"“Meteorology is not superfluous to the story,” W. G. Sebald advised the students in one of his final fiction-writing classes. It’s an observation that has never seemed lost on Michael Cunningham. Consider how he introduces Virginia Woolf’s last afternoon on earth in the opening sentence of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Hours”: “She hurries from the house, wearing a coat too heavy for the weather.” And his 2010 novel “By Nightfall” ended with some rather Joycean evening snow tapping at the bedroom window of an affluent, troubled Manhattan husband, a man about to have a reckoning with his own self-centeredness.

As an ex-Catholic and wavering evangelical Christian, Martins is an avid consumer of what he calls “atheist porn” by writers like Richard Dawkins.

Woven into this dark tale is the equally absorbing story of a daughter’s quest to research and imagine an elusive woman in order to get close to her, even though her very essence embodied distance: “For all of us, Lucile — her gentleness and her aggression — remains a mystery.” The difficulty de Vigan has in describing her mother, she confesses, “is not so far removed from the distress we felt as children and teenagers when she disappeared.” Which she did, dramatically, in a series of manic episodes, beginning in her early 30s.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/books/review/nothing-holds-back-the-night-by-delphine-de-vigan.html
2014-05-09,Inside the List,"Life’s Too Short: Greg Iles’s thriller “Natchez Burning,” about racism and murder in the Jim Crow South, is his first new novel in five years. That’s a long time between books for a writer whose previous best sellers arrived as regularly as the Olympics, every two years or so. But Iles has a good excuse. In 2011, when he was putting the finishing touches on an earlier version of “Natchez Burning,” he was in a car crash that tore his aorta, left him in a coma for eight days and resulted in the loss of his right leg below the knee. The accident, along with the death of his father a year earlier, inspired him to have another go at his novel. “I realized that life was too short to pull any punches,” Iles told The Greenville News in South Carolina earlier this month. “I decided there was no room in this book for formula and fluff. The story had to be handled with appropriate gravitas. I had to deal with it not only the way it deserved but in a way that would make my father proud.” The reworked “Natchez Burning” — which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 — clocks in at almost 800 pages, and is the first of a planned trilogy. Among other things, it explores the role of social elites in allowing racism to thrive. “The white lower middle class and lower class did not commit those acts of violence in a vacuum,” Iles told The Greenville News. “They had been given tacit approval by the upper levels of white society.” Nor, he said, is such racism restricted to the past. “Look at the scandal over the comments by the Clippers’ owner,” he said, referring to Donald Sterling. “The legacy of slavery is the greatest psychic wound in the American character. We still haven’t fully dealt with it, and I think it’ll take another lifetime to deal with it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Dr. Robert Needlman, who revised and updated Dr. Benjamin Spock’s “Baby and Child Care,” once told me that the purpose of bedtime stories is to give the imagination a kind of way station between wakefulness and sleep that facilitates an easier slip into unconsciousness. (We were talking about young children, but I think this goes for all of us.) So books for bedtime, sure. But why about?

Dwight D.

2014-05-12,Who Is That Lady in the Painting?,"Making its first trip to the United States more than four centuries after its creation, Parmigianino’s renowned, beguiling portrait of a turbaned woman — known since the early 18th century as “Schiava Turca,” or the Turkish slave, from 1531-34 — will go on view Tuesday at the Frick Collection, bringing along the question that has long trailed it: Who was she? Almost certainly neither Turkish nor a slave, an identification that came about in error because of her exotic costume. Some have wondered whether the woman was real at all or maybe just a feminine ideal dreamed up by the painter. But Aimee Ng, a research associate at the Frick and the show’s curator, has a new theory based on subtle clues in the portrait: that she might have been Veronica Gambara, an accomplished poet in Parmigianino’s circle.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/arts/design/who-is-that-lady-in-the-painting.html

In songs that lean toward the reflective — “What will we do now?/We’ve lost it to trying,” one goes — his music encompasses pinpoint orchestral arrangements as well as electronics that can be glitchy, glossy and dizzying. Son Lux appears Tuesday, sharing a bill with the guitarist Rafiq Bhatia as part of the Undead Music series.

Ms. Bartlett added some things that made the grid pleasingly weird, however, several of which are apparent in the 26 works in the grandly titled “Jennifer Bartlett: History of the Universe — Works 1970-2011” at the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill.

Maria Bello plays Dover’s wife, submerged in despair; Viola Davis and Terrence Howard are the other girl’s parents, whose doubts about Dover’s means of extracting information strike him as weak and irrational; Melissa Leo is the suspect’s aunt, intent on shielding her mentally disabled nephew; and Jake Gyllenhaal is the tormented cop determined to solve the case. “ ‘Prisoners’ is the kind of movie that can quiet a room full of casual thrill-seekers,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “It absorbs and controls your attention with such assurance that you hold your breath for fear of distracting the people on screen, exhaling in relief or amazement at each new revelation.

2014-05-12,What’s On Sunday,"9 P.M. (NBC) ROSEMARY’S BABY In this two-part remake of the 1968 Roman Polanski thriller, the director Agnieszka Holland transfers the setting from the Dakota on Central Park West to the Eighth Arrondissement of Paris, where Rosemary Woodhouse (Zoe Saldana, above) has moved with her husband, Guy (Patrick J. Adams), a writer with a teaching stint at the Sorbonne. Ms. Holland also transforms the dotty older couple next door, first played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, into French sophisticates (Carole Bouquet and Jason Isaacs) who offer the Americans their friendship and a spare apartment. This being Paris, they discuss the transaction in an elegant sex club. And when Rosemary, eager to get pregnant again after a miscarriage, visits an OBGYN, the examining room looks like the rare-books section of the Académie Française. “ ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ bends to current fashions, and, accordingly, is more straightforward and much gorier than the original film,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “But partly because the story has been so altered, it still has mystery and suspense. And because it’s Paris, it is possible to wonder, at least for a while, if maybe the problem is Rosemary, not her neighbors, who seem so serenely superior and all knowing.” Part 2 will be shown on Thursday at 9.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

2014-05-12,Rarified Perfume: The Perks of Membership at MiN New York,"As the co-curators of the indie apothecary MiN New York in NoLita, Chad Murawczyk and Mindy Yang take a simple approach to stocking their shelves: “If we can’t find something we want, we make it,” Murawczyk says. So far, that’s lead to such varied creations as atmospheric candles gilded in precious metals, high-performance skin-care creams and hand-ticked silk scarves depicting photographs of Havana shot by Murawczyk himself. The latest addition to the MiN oeuvre: a series of abstract fragrances, called Scent Stories, debuting this week. Composed of notes that normally don’t land in eau, such as pencil shavings and ozone, the collection of 11 unisex scents took a year to develop with a master perfumer in Grasse, France. “The idea was to make each scent like a chapter or a short story: it would be vivid, visceral and disconnected from the others, but take you somewhere,” Yang says. Indeed, many of the fragrances were inspired by the pair’s own memories and journeys. Dahab, for example, evokes the deserts and deep seas of Egypt where Murawczyk spent time. “It’s incense-y, smoky and mysterious,” he says of the saffron-, cumin- and nutmeg-laced blend. Yang, who is also a trained reiki healer, is particularly drawn to Shaman, describing it as a “futurist nomad” scent, with a “mystical air.” The violet leaf note is especially nuanced, she says, and conveys “a sense of clairvoyance.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/t-magazine/on-beauty-rarified-perfume-the-perks-of-membership-at-min-new-york.html

(Cinemax) MAMA (2013) In this modern fairy tale directed by Andy Muschietti, the uncle (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) of two feral sisters (Megan Charpentier, above, and Isabelle Nélisse), abandoned by their father in the woods, moves them into a home with his goth girlfriend (Jessica Chastain). Then a grotesque figure the girls call Mama appears in the shadows and begins to wreak havoc on their lives. But is the monster simply a coping mechanism for dealing with tragedy? Or is Mama the essence of the girls’ dead mother? “Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while the director Guillermo del Toro, “the reigning godfather of motion picture horror,” is only an executive producer on the film, she wrote, “it fits with the more successful movies he’s signed on to.

It’s Ruby’s first solo show in Chelsea since he parked two menacing, rectilinear forms (a bus and a big brick of human-size cages) inside the Pace Gallery four years ago. This new show, entitled “Sunrise, Sunset,” presents a dense cross-section of recent works the prolific and controversial artist has produced in his fabled studio-cum-industrial-complex on the outskirts of Downtown L.A. — where only weeks ago, a Mack truck veered off the road and through the wall of the building, destroying a number of mammoth spray paintings and Ruby’s studio manager’s car (fortunately, no one was injured). Though the accident was a setback, the grandiose, unexpected destruction of the incident aligned well with Ruby’s expansive practice. The exhibition is full of charged objects, including Corinthian columns dripping with lustrous red polyurethane, a super-size canary-yellow electric chair, infernal stoves and bleached fabrics that evoke everything from Rorschach tests to the American flag. Here, the artist reflects on his intentions for the show and his place in the art world.

Griswold wrote about young Afghan women for whom writing landai served as a vital, and in some cases sole, link to a wider world. These young women were often confined to their fathers’ homes in the rural villages where they lived; they would sneak calls to a Kabul-based poetry hotline to read their poems and exchange ideas with other Afghan women — parliamentarians, doctors, professors — whose lives they could only imagine.

2014-05-14,A Fresh Hub for Young Talent at New York Design Week,"If locals have one complaint about New York Design Week, it’s that the city can seem over-reliant on foreign brands and ho-hum showrooms for content. In 2010, Monica Khemsurov (a T contributor) and Jill Singer of the online magazine Sight Unseen founded the NoHo Design District to counteract that problem with a neighborhood-wide festival of quirky installations, events and pop-ups that ran during Design Week. The duo, known for their knack for identifying new talent, originally looked to create the same neighborhood feel they had experienced when attending other global design weeks in London and Milan. However, by last year, the trials of securing real estate in a booming market had become overwhelming. “In the end, it proved so difficult to find those spaces that we spent 80 percent of our time doing that, and zero percent curating,” says Khemsurov. “The only way for us to evolve was to let go of Noho and become nomadic.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/t-magazine/sight-unseen-offsite-new-york-design-week.html

In designing the space, which extends 70 feet below the memorial plaza, Davis says he wanted the experience to be physical — visitors enter by descending a ramp, as if drawn by gravity — but also heavy with symbolism and emotion. How does he hope people will feel when they leave? “Optimistic about the future,” he says. “That we have the wherewithal as a society to create positive results from negative events.” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/where-the-twin-towers-stood.html

(FX Movie Channel) STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE (1939) In the first of two African adventures directed by Henry King, Henry Stanley (Spencer Tracy), a reporter for The New York Herald, travels to Zanzibar in search of the long-missing British missionary Dr. David Livingstone (Cedric Hardwicke). Writing in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the lavish production — which helped to immortalize the famous greeting “Dr. Livingstone, I presume” — “intelligent and restrained and dignified.” In “The Snows of Kilimanjaro” (1952), at 9:30, adapted from the short story by Ernest Hemingway, an author (Gregory Peck, above with Susan Hayward) seriously wounded in a hunting accident reflects on the love (Ava Gardner) he lost and the novel he never wrote. Mr. King and the producer Darryl Zanuck “have made a picture that constantly fascinates the eye and stimulates the emotions in small, isolated ways,” Mr. Crowther wrote in The Times. He added: “The shots of wild animals in Africa — elephants, lions, rhinoceroses, giraffes and all manner of lesser creatures — are as magnificent and exciting as any yet, and the atmosphere and beauty of a safari under the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro are superb. Especially one sequence in close-up of a swimming herd of hippopotamuses goes down in this reviewer’s notebook as the best one of game we’ve ever seen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html
2014-05-14,Anger Grows in Vietnam Over Dispute With China,"HANOI, Vietnam — Thousands of workers rampaged through an industrial area in southern Vietnam on Tuesday in what reportedly began as protests against China’s stationing of an oil rig in disputed waters off of Vietnam’s coast.  The riots were some of the worst civil unrest in recent years and appear to have prompted  restraints on the local media by Vietnam’s authoritarian government. An article about the protests that was posted online by a Vietnamese state newspaper on Tuesday was removed by Wednesday morning.  The Chinese Embassy in Hanoi issued a notice on Wednesday that urged Chinese living in Vietnam to “minimize unnecessary outings.”  A staff member at the Chutex Garment Factory north of Ho Chi Minh City said 8,000 to 10,000 workers were involved in the rampage at his factory.  “They burned the office,” said the staff member who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The rioters “burned everything, all of the materials, computers, machines.”  Police units and fire fighters arrived at the factory Tuesday and “disbanded,” the rioters, he said. On Wednesday morning police “captured” around 15 to 20 men who were attempting to loot the premises, he said.  The Chutex factory, located in Song Than Industrial Park 2 in southern Binh Duong Province, is described on its web site as one of the largest garment exporters in Vietnam. Chutex International, the parent company, was founded by a Taiwanese garment executive.  It is unclear why rioters targeted a factory linked to Taiwan. Media in Hong Kong said  workers might not have been distinguishing between mainland China and Taiwan, a self-governing island which also has claims to territory in the South China Sea.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/world/asia/anger-grows-in-vietnam-over-dispute-with-china.html

2014-05-16,The March to War,"In February 1933, President-elect Franklin Roosevelt was nearly murdered in Miami by a gunman whose errant fatal shot struck Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago. Cermak gallantly told Roosevelt, “I’m glad it was me instead of you.” Today’s Americans should not disagree. Had Roosevelt been killed, the 32nd president of the United States would have been his running mate, Speaker John Nance Garner of Texas, a neophyte in foreign and military affairs, isolationist by instinct and deeply rooted in a Congress determined, notwithstanding the growing threats from Hitler and the imperial Japanese, to keep another president from repeating what a majority of its members considered to be Woodrow Wilson’s catastrophic mistake of needlessly dragging the nation into a distant “foreign war.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/books/review/no-end-save-victory-and-japan-1941.html

A second show, “I Am Involved in Learning to Perceive and Use Light,” opens tonight at Petzel Gallery and runs through June 21. The title is taken from a 1974 essay by the artist, which the gallery offers in lieu of a press release. In it, he discusses his intentions, methodologies and views on aesthetic value systems. “My basic tenet is relatively simple,” he explains. “To relate the former to the future, the last to the next.” Heinecken carries out this philosophy quite literally in one of the best known strands of his practice, a related series of double exposures made from the 1960s to the 1990s, in which he culled current events and women’s magazines to find individual pages containing two faces that made unforgettable figurative abstractions when overlaid.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/on-view-robert-heinecken-object-matter-moma-petzel-gallery/

In “The Immigrant,” James Gray (who directed the film and wrote it with Richard Menello) tries to push through this rosy nostalgia and recapture some of the terror and strangeness of the journey from the Old World to the New. The first shot is of the Statue of Liberty shrouded in harbor mist, and the film unfolds in the gap between the promise that lady embodies and the harsh realities a newcomer encounters once she gets off the boat.

No matter how serious and aesthetically high-minded, the festival always banks on its stars. This year Quentin Tarantino will help wrap up the proceedings by introducing a restoration of Sergio Leone’s 1964 red-sauce western, “A Fistful of Dollars.” It’s a celebrity event that will bookend the one delivered on Wednesday, when Nicole Kidman — the star of the widely derided “Grace of Monaco” — drifted down the red carpet, reprising her familiar role as a supernova who transcends her every stinker.

Especially since 2008, when the aftermath of the Chengdu earthquake in Western China awakened his conscience and made him a determined critic of his government, Mr. Ai has taunted, mocked and passionately denounced the authoritarianism, corruption and incompetence that he sees around him. He has made more-or-less conventional works of art reflecting these concerns, and made deft use of social media and his own celebrity.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/movies/ai-weiwei-the-fake-case-follows-a-scrutinized-artist.html

2014-05-16,Iran: Oil Exports Continue to Decline," Iran’s oil exports declined in April for the second consecutive month, the International Energy Agency reported Thursday, moving much closer to levels permitted under a temporary accord on the Iranian nuclear dispute that is set to expire in July. Monthly data compiled by the energy agency, a 29-member group of oil importers, showed that Iran’s exports were 1.11 million barrels a day in April, down from 1.29 million barrels a day in March and 1.58 million barrels a day in February. The temporary accord specified that Iran’s monthly oil exports are not to exceed one million barrels a day on average for the six-month duration, and the excesses raised concern among critics of the accord that Iran was violating its terms. Obama administration officials have said they believe that Iran’s May, June and July exports will be lower. Under the accord, some Western economic sanctions were eased in exchange for a freeze on most of Iran’s nuclear activities, for the purpose of giving negotiators more time to reach a permanent agreement. Negotiators for the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany are seeking guarantees that Iran’s nuclear fuel cannot be used to make bombs.

2014-05-16,What’s On Friday,"9 P.M.

Barkhad Abdi, a first-time actor who received an Oscar nomination, plays Muse, their leader, whose actions lead to the arrival of the American military and its warships. “The existential realities that inform contemporary Somali piracy turn out to be one of the unexpected themes of ‘Captain Phillips,’ which begins as something of a procedural about men at work and morphs into a jittery thriller even as it also deepens, brilliantly, unexpectedly, into an unsettling look at global capitalism and American privilege and power,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this best picture nominee, adapted by the director Paul Greengrass from Mr. Phillips’s book, “A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea.” “Phillips is unambiguously a heroic figure, but he’s scarcely the sole point of interest in a movie that steadily and almost stealthily asserts the agonized humanity of his captors.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

The music will take care of itself: The lineup includes pop-minded D.J.-producers like Calvin Harris and Afrojack; Steve Angello, one-third of the disbanded arena-house champs known as the Swedish House Mafia; the Chicago house legend Green Velvet; the pop aspirants Krewella; the teenage phenom Martin Garrix; and the French abrasionist DJ Snake.

When Arthur Conan Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes in 1893, readers objected so strenuously that Doyle — after trying to mollify them with a prequel — finally gave in and resurrected the character as a cross-dressing mixed martial artist played by Robert Downey Jr. More recently, Charlaine Harris has heard from readers livid at her 2013 novel “Dead Ever After,” which ended her beloved Sookie Stackhouse urban fantasy series (the basis for the HBO show “True Blood”). “I had death threats, and people putting curses on me,” she said in a recent phone conversation. “All the usual stuff.” But Sookie is well and truly finished, Harris insists: “She’s in my rearview mirror. It was not a hard choice. Of course, it’s a little scary when you’re making such and such dollars a year because of a character.

The state prosecuted Flaubert for gross indecency, despite the terrible punishment he metes out to his wayward heroine. Zola was not subjected to the same ordeal, but critics treated him as a rogue purveying smut in the name of realism. Both novels have appeared in countless editions since the 19th century. Both have been adapted to the screen. Now they are available as audiobooks, read by two gifted English actresses: “Madame Bovary” by Juliet Stevenson and “Thérèse Raquin” by Kate Winslet.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/books/review/madame-bovary-and-therese-raquin-as-audiobooks.html
2014-05-16,Talk of the Town,"It would be hard to think of two writers less alike — stylistically and, for that matter, personally — than Truman Capote and John O’Hara, yet they shared many pre­occupations.

Most of the stories assembled in the recent Penguin anthology of O’Hara’s New York stories were written in either the ’30s or the ’60s, but some are set decades earlier. And yet in the newly released audio recordings of the two books, maybe even more than on the page, the versions of New York that are evoked seem virtually interchangeable: It’s a city of people on the make or else clinging to their former reputations, where everyone drinks too much, and where you can easily wake up in bed next to someone you barely remember meeting.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/books/review/john-oharas-new-york-stories-and-truman-capotes-breakfast-at-tiffanys.html

Combining aspects of her own biography, the physical sciences and psychiatry — Galchen is herself a medical doctor, trained in psychiatry — she created a vertiginous narrative about the nature of love and loss.

We are less than 5 percent of the world’s population, but we warehouse 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated population.

2014-05-16,Popcast: Checking In on Burger Records,"On this week’s Popcast, we look at the scene around Burger Records, based in Fullerton, Calif. — a teen-centered, low-budget, hyper-productive explosion of the new garage rock, though it isn’t exactly the scholarly, record-obsessed, semi-antiquarian kind we’ve seen in the past. Lee Rickard and Sean Bohrman, former bandmates in Thee Makeout Party!, started the Burger Records label in 2007 and opened a record store two years later; in that time they’ve become the center of a scene that’s generating excitement, loyalty and a sense of identity, especially among an Orange County contingent that’s under the legal drinking age and hungry for local culture. Burger’s pace has become manic lately — it released 300 items last year, between cassette-only editions or reissues and original albums on LP and CD — but it seems to be working: Burgerama, its annual two-day festival in Santa Ana, sold 10,000 tickets this year, and its bands (including Cherry Glazerr, Together Pangea, Audacity, the Garden and Gap Dream) have started to move onto the national radar. (Although if all Burger records ever did was to produce the wild, messy, energetic weekly videos for its YouTube channel, BRGRTV, it might have served its purpose on earth.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/popcast-checking-in-on-burger-records/

2014-05-20,Food Matters | An L.A. Chef’s Guide to Adventurous Backyard Cooking,"“You’ve heard the term ‘food orgy,’ ” says Ben Ford. “I love the loss of inhibition when people get in a big group and enjoy a feast. That’s why I did this cookbook.” The chef and owner of Los Angeles’s Ford’s Filling Station gastro pub (and son of Harrison Ford) has authored “Taming the Feast” (Simon and Schuster, $34.99), a how-to guide for bringing “Game of Thrones”-size banquets to your own kitchen table, whether you’re serving a phalanx of friends or just a family of four. “The idea of working with whole animals, trying to close that proximity between the back door of my kitchen and the farmland, the book came out of that,” says Ford. Readers will have a difficult time finding another cookbook with both instructions for “rigging a pig for vertical roasting” and everyday backyard fare, like grilled beer-braised bratwurst or a simple safflower oil aioli. Alternative, more manageable recipes are offered for each feast — in case you, or your landlord, prefers that your paella come from a Weber or stovetop and not an inferno in the backyard. While such projects as sourcing cedar planks on which to roast sturgeon may sound complicated, for Ford the book is actually about getting back to basics; for instance, he teaches techniques like using one’s hands for testing not only the doneness of meat, but also the temperature level over a fire. Says Ford, “I’m very much a touch, feel, smell kind of chef.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/ben-ford-la-chef-guide-to-barbecue-memorial-day/

Ryckebusch invited her to his home and studio in Fontainebleau to work together, and the striking, sculptural results — a five-piece capsule collection including rings, bracelets and a necklace — will debut Thursday evening at Creatures of Comfort in New York, with more designs to follow in future seasons. “These really are pieces that hum and breathe.

Then again, much about Mr. Branagh’s career is difficult to process. He wrote a memoir at the age of 28 (called, to be fair, “Beginning”), and he directed a very silly comedy on Broadway (“The Play What I Wrote”) inspired by the double act Morecambe and Wise. Perhaps the strangest shift is that Mr. Branagh, the wunderkind once considered Laurence Olivier’s heir, is now directing Hollywood action movies (“Thor”). His is a complex, playful career that dabbles in many forms but always returns to what made him famous: Shakespeare. So it’s no surprise that his first starring role here is as Macbeth, in a critically acclaimed production from England, which he directed with Rob Ashford. Ben Brantley of The New York Times called it “utterly assured and intelligent.” “Macbeth” begins performances May 31 in the Park Avenue Armory’s enormous Drill Hall.

This will change Friday when “Cecil Beaton at Home” opens at the Salisbury Museum in England’s Wiltshire district. The exhibition will be on view through Sept. 19. For Beaton, two homes counted: his Wiltshire country estates Ashcombe, where he lived from 1930 to 1945, and Reddish, which he occupied from 1947 until his death. (The 1950s magazine ad, right, was photographed there.) The show’s curator, Andrew Ginger, has recreated parts of two rooms from those houses, installing Beaton’s Circus Bed, complete with unicorns, sea horses and barley-twist posts.

(LMN) WINTER’S BONE (2010) Jennifer Lawrence received her first Oscar nomination for her role as Ree Dolly, a teenager living in the Ozarks of southwestern Missouri who goes in search of her meth-cooking father after he puts up the family home to cover his bail and disappears. But her efforts to find him place her in a terrible dilemma: either betray the code of silence that keeps her clan proudly on the wrong side of the law or face destitution. (Above from left, Ashlee Thompson, Ms. Lawrence and Isaiah Stone in the film.) John Hawkes plays her uncle, whose silent menace soon erupts into violence, though he’s more compassionate than most. The harshness in Debra Granik’s “regional-realist morality tale,” based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, “is not there to illuminate a sociological condition,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Something more primal, almost Greek in its archaic power, is at stake in ‘Winter’s Bone,’ and its visual and emotional starkness do not feel like simple badges of authenticity.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2014-05-23,By the Booker,"Edward St. Aubyn is that thing beloved by heritage series from the BBC, a man of ancient and aristocratic pedigree. He writes of an upper-class world so central to the English novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it has shaped the modern imagination: You might think we all sprang from big houses with handmade wallpaper and quietly smoldering servants. St. Aubyn cuts through the fantasy of privilege, however, with lacerating precision; once you have read his Melrose cycle of novels, there is no going back. These books — “Never Mind,” “Bad News,” “Some Hope,” “Mother’s Milk” and “At Last” — set a marker in the English tradition by changing our view of what preceded them. The narrator, Patrick Melrose, is raped at the age of 5 by his sadistic, patrician father and later partially disinherited by his cold and foolish mother. After Melrose, the aristocratic novel, from Richardson’s swooning “Pamela” to the affectless cruelties of Waugh, can never look the same again.

2014-05-23,Billionaire Boys Club,"In 2010, two of the Koch brothers, Charles of Wichita, Kan., and David of New York, rather suddenly became the top-of-mind conservatives for American liberals. That was partly because at that moment the Democratic Party controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, so there wasn’t a dominant conservative politician to focus on; partly because of a wave of news media attention, notably an influential story on the Kochs’ political activities by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker; and partly because of the rise of the Tea Party movement, of which the Koch political apparatus was a primary backer. The conservative victories in the Congres­sional elections that fall looked like conclusive proof of the Kochs’ power. The very first television ads the Obama re-election campaign ran in 2012 were attacks on the Kochs, not on the Republican Party.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/books/review/sons-of-wichita-by-daniel-schulman.html

It’s always a stand-in for something more consequential (take it from a former grad student who knows).

In fact, she has just persuaded her parents to allow her to live in their vacation cabin in California’s Sierra Nevada for “three months free and clear,” so that she can “bang . . . out” her dissertation in economics. The 28-year-old, high-achieving Cress comes from cautious, stingy stock, a foundation that gives her a natural aptitude for her field: Her father is a “traumatized victim of the Great Depression,” and his “fears and obsessions had imprinted her with thought patterns that, superficially at least, were indistinguishable from the mind-set of a trained economist: What is given up to get this?

Bright, sensitive and deeply neurotic, Susanna sees “malevolence” in certain toilets and thinks, as she shucks corn in advance of a dinner with adored family friends, “Something about corn was sad.” Visiting famous monuments sends her into an existential tailspin, and by the time she’s 9 she’s already mourning her lost youth. At school, she’s bored and disdainful. When her sixth-grade teacher gives examples of solids, liquids and gases, Susanna raises her hand to ask, “What about mayonnaise?” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/books/review/cambridge-by-susanna-kaysen.html

2014-05-23,Inside the List,"Dog Days: Jeffery Deaver’s new Lincoln Rhyme thriller, “The Skin Collector,” makes its debut on the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. Part of the perverse allure of this series — which now numbers some dozen books — has always come from the demented nature of its villains, and “The Skin Collector” is no exception: It features a ­serial-killing tattoo artist who makes his own ink out of a slow-acting and painful poison. But a person can spend only so many hours a day inventing gruesome murder schemes, and one of the ways Deaver likes to unwind is by breeding show dogs with a business partner near his North Carolina home. “I’m not as creepy as the things I write about,” he told The Associated Press in 2007. That doesn’t mean you can’t question his priorities — he once passed up dinner with Angelina Jolie to tend to a dog’s matted coat. But Deaver knows what he’s doing: His briards have won Best of Breed more than once at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York. “Your heart’s pounding,” he told a reporter in 2005, comparing the experience to that of a father watching a Little League game. “You’ll still love the dog just as much if he doesn’t win. But I can’t help it. I hope he wins.” Given the elaborate plot twists and psychological head games in his novels, is Deaver ever tempted to mess with his dogs’ minds, just a little? “I couldn’t possibly do that,” he told The Sun Herald newspaper in Australia in 2006. “The dogs are much cleverer than me.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/inside-the-list.html

(Cinemax) THE WORLD’S END (2013) In the summer of 1990, five British teenagers set out on a pub crawl in the town of Newton Haven, vomiting, fighting and having drunken sex along what is known as the Golden Mile. But they failed to make it through the 12 requisite watering holes, the last of which was called the World’s End. Twenty years later, they give it a second try in this comedy directed by Edgar Wright, the final installment in his Cornetto Trilogy, following “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz.” Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Paddy Considine, along with Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan, play the Golden Milers. Four have traded their wild youth for adult respectability; the fifth decidedly has not. Then the robots show up, and these men just may be humanity’s only hope for survival. “The Cornetto Trilogy is named after a popular ice cream treat, and the buzz of ‘The World’s End’ is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end — no ‘Hangover,’ in other words.

2014-05-26,Young Man With a Horn,"The jazz trumpeter Theo Croker is the grandson of Doc Cheatham, who played the same instrument with great beauty and economy until his death at the age of 91 in 1997. In a reverse of the typical trumpeter’s story, Cheatham seemed to reach his peak in the last phase of his life. Mr. Croker, 29, may have learned something from his grandfather’s pacing. He started with plenty of promise and made a very good record in his early 20s (“The Fundamentals,” on Left Sided), but rather than speed-track his career, he worked in Shanghai for seven years, in clubs and on TV. He has a new album, “Afrophysicist” (DDB/Sony), showing his breadth, with plush funk and rock idioms, some subtle and complex new-jazz ones, a ballad standard (“Moody’s Mood for Love”) and high-wire soloing. He’ll play this week with his band DVRK Funk, including the pianist Sullivan Fortner and the drummer Kassa Overall, with the singer Dee Dee Bridgewater as guest.

They’re talking about movies in a multilayered film from the French director Olivier Assayas that is itself partly an inquiry into cinema. The star, Maria Enders, has become famous in big movies, yet she also voices contempt for them. Given how closely Mr. Assayas cuts to a central tension that plays out yearly at the Cannes Film Festival — a temple of auteurist worship that rolls out the red carpet for industrial cinema — it isn’t surprising that “Sils Maria” wasn’t wholly embraced here.

The name change was approved by 29 residents and opposed by 19, Mayor Lorenzo Rodríguez Pérez said Sunday. The village has only 56 registered inhabitants. The village will be renamed Castrillo Mota de Judíos, or Little Hill Fort of Jews. Historical records have so far failed to yield a definitive answer about how the village got its name. One possible explanation is that Jewish converts to Catholicism in the 17th century switched to a name that would clearly distance them from their Jewish past and reduce the risk of further persecution. Another is that a local clerk mistakenly changed “mota,” or hill, into “mata,” or kill. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/world/europe/spain-village-votes-for-new-name.html

The kids closest to my age, Virginie, Éric and Benoît, treated me like a sister, not like a tourist from Indiana, where I came from. Together we gathered eggs, rode on Mobylettes to the village candy store, set the table when the curé came to lunch, watched the French version of “The Avengers,” and squabbled over who got to ride shotgun on car trips.

2014-05-29,Health Officials Reverse Diagnosis of MERS in Illinois Man,"Reversing an earlier announcement, federal health officials said Wednesday that an Illinois man who met with an Indiana man who later fell ill with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, did not pick up the virus from him. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a first lung sample from the Illinois man had tested negative for the coronavirus that causes MERS, but two preliminary blood samples had then tested positive for antibodies to it. That led the C.D.C. to announce on May 17 that the man had been infected but had not fallen ill; this would have been the first transmission of the virus within the United States. On Wednesday, they said that a more sensitive blood test that takes at least five days to produce results showed that he never had the virus. The most likely explanation, one of the officials said, is that the preliminary test had cross-reacted with antibodies the man had to a previous coronavirus infection. At least six coronaviruses are known to infect humans: Four normally cause common cold symptoms, while the other two, MERS and SARS, are more serious. Only two MERS cases have been found in the United States — the Indiana man and another in Florida. Both had recently arrived after working in Saudi hospitals where there have been hundreds of cases since March. Thus far, C.D.C. officials said, extensive testing indicates that the two men did not pass on the virus to any family members or health care workers treating them.

2014-05-29,What’s on Thursday,"6:05 P.M. (Starz Cinema) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance (“Before Sunset”) in Paris that began nine years before that (“Before Sunrise”) in Vienna, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke, above with Ms. Delpy) are now in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), the son he left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with Hank. Celine sees his question as a demand to make it happen. And so they will fight about this — and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women — throughout the course of a day. “ ‘Before Sunrise,’ ‘Before Sunset’ and ‘Before Midnight’ are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists’ offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this trilogy from the director Richard Linklater.

The agreement between the government and the inquiry, led by John Chilcot, will allow publication of some selected quotations from Mr. Blair’s exchanges with Mr. Bush, but will not include any of Mr. Bush’s replies, Mr. Chilcot said in a letter to Jeremy Heywood, the British government’s top civil servant. “Detailed consideration of gists and quotes requested by the inquiry” has now begun, and quotations will be kept to “the minimum necessary to enable the inquiry to articulate its conclusions,” Mr. Chilcot said. The deal comes after months of deadlock over what would be released; the report is expected to be published before the end of the year. At issue are about 25 written notes from Mr. Blair to Mr. Bush and more than 130 records of conversations. The inquiry was set up in 2009 and was expected to report in 2010.

2014-05-30,What’s On Friday,"11 P.M. (TV5Monde) MONSIEUR HIRE (1989) When a young woman is killed in a Paris suburb, the police immediately suspect the resident loner (Michel Blanc), a tailor who was once jailed for indecent exposure, and whom nobody seems to like. Sandrine Bonnaire plays his pretty neighbor, who never thinks to pull down the shades on the windows facing his, whether she’s dressing or undressing or even making love to her ne’er-do-well boyfriend. This French melodrama, directed by Patrice Leconte from a novel by Georges Simenon, “has the makings of a first-rate psychological study,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. But here, he added, Mr. Leconte’s normally lighthearted touch “is both artificial and heavy, filled with movie gestures that are not entirely fresh.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2014-05-30,The Dark Side,"Robert Louis Stevenson’s “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” is an oblique and artful Gothic tale framed as a detective story. The truth seeker is Jekyll’s lawyer, Utterson, the book’s most prominent character. Jekyll — the ­gentleman who dabbles in chemical self-­transformation — appears only ­intermittently, never fully speaking for himself until the end, when he discloses the details of the disastrous experiments that unleashed his primitive alter ego. The novel isn’t a conventional horror story, lingering on the macabre for its own sake, but an allegory of the divided self, perhaps also a meditation on addiction. Stevenson dramatizes human duality but doesn’t analyze its causes, treating it as pervasive and fundamental. For him, the Jekyll-Hyde split is the split in all of us, between the animals we evolved from and the angels we aspire to be.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/hyde-by-daniel-levine.html
2014-05-30,Life Out Loud,"When Brittney Griner was a senior in high school, a 6-foot-8 center on her way to an all-­American basketball career at Baylor University, she feared telling her father that she was a lesbian. His explosive, curse-filled response upon finding out, Griner writes in a painful, searing and ultimately liberating memoir, “In My Skin: My Life on and Off the Basketball Court,” was exactly what she had dreaded.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/in-my-skin-by-brittney-griner.html
2014-05-30,Science Fiction,"In “Annihilation,” the first book of Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy, readers were introduced to Area X, a stretch of coastal wetland whose conspiracy-theory name is the icing atop a mille-feuille of layered, slow-building, deliciously creepy horror. Twelve teams of ­researchers, stripped of names to somehow protect them from the identity-warping effects of the danger zone, have traveled into Area X; “Annihilation” followed “the biologist” as she seemingly became the only survivor to actually understand what was happening.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/jeff-vandermeers-authority-and-more.html
2014-05-30,Thrillers,"I had the wrong idea about beach books. It came from “Goodbye, Columbus,” where Neil Klugman tells Brenda Patimkin that his cousin Doris always has “War and Peace” by the pool: “That’s how I know it’s the summer, when Doris is reading ‘War and Peace.’ ” Pool and beach being the same to me back then — an idiot kid forced to sit outside with no TV, uncomfortable with my shirt off as my grandfather paraded around to show off he still had a body — I didn’t see that Philip Roth was mocking Doris, and so for years protected myself from the water and sand I resented and feared by lugging along a classic. This is how I read “Swann’s Way” at the Mamaroneck Beach Club as a guest of Uncle Marty and Aunt Lee. It took many visits.

They don’t know if I had the game of my life or a complete shocker. They say, “Great game! You were awesome!” Sometimes they even tell me I was wonderful when I didn’t play a single minute.

2014-05-30,Travel,"Paul Bowles observed that an important difference between a tourist and a traveler “is that the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking.” This difference also separates writers about travels from “travel writers.” Is the voyaging writer telling us canny stories from a romping trip or using his peregrinations to relocate his place in the world? Sometimes it’s difficult to tell. D. H. Lawrence knocked off travel essays about places in which he had arrived only a few hours before, but he was writing about himself and his intuitions. Bowles, for his part, lived for years in Morocco but traveled through the desert with a suitcase filled with his favorite neckties. Do we read either man for profound and meticulously earned insights about Sardinia or the Sahara, or for their ability to convey something about themselves as they pass through those places? Most writers are “passing through,” and we expect no more of them. It’s part of their charm, if they have any. And part of the sometimes dubious premise of travel writing itself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/john-waterss-carsick-and-more.html

2014-05-30,Shall We Dance?,"All movies are musical, film being as reliant on rhythm and tempo as sonatas are. Only a few movies are musicals, though, and the fewness isn’t going away. Live-action musicals are nearly as endangered a movie species as westerns. Whether you think those few are too many or nowhere near enough will go a long way toward determining your response to Richard Barrios’s “Dangerous Rhythm: Why Movie Musicals Matter.” The subtitle indicates which side Barrios comes down on. The fact of his having written the exhaustively researched and exuberantly argued “A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film” (1995) should settle any doubts.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/dangerous-rhythm-by-richard-barrios.html
2014-05-30,Street Life,"The flâneur, that feature of the 19th-century urban landscape, stood apart from the city as a wide-eyed wanderer. But when he had a camera in his hands, he became the archetypal street photographer, a curious observer who captured his environment in what Henri Cartier-Bresson called its ""decisive moments”: spontaneous, serendipitous, intuitive, singular. In “Unfamiliar Streets: The Photographs of Richard Avedon, Charles Moore, Martha Rosler, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia,” the art historian Katherine A. Bussard explores the genre of street photography, beginning with this dominant definition and then expanding it. The photographers she investigates, whose work here spans the 1940s through 2001, manipulate the viewer’s imagination of the city, or change the way viewers act within it. According to Bussard, accurately representing experiences of city streets “involves addressing issues of gender, commerce, race, collectivity, class, dispossession, sexuality and spectacle.” In other words, street photography isn’t only the magic of capturing a well-composed slice of life; it’s the more complex task of recapitulating or intensifying the economic, class and gender tensions of the city street within an image. The image should galvanize the viewer or, ideally, alter street life as it’s lived simply by the fact of the image having been made.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/unfamiliar-streets-and-touching-strangers.html
2014-05-30,Minnesota Nice,"Some writers define themselves by contrasting their talents or sensibility with those of another writer. “Well, I’m no Joyce Carol Oates,” they’ll tell you, false modesty oozing from their pores like musk. “I publish a book every eight years.” Or, “You wouldn’t confuse me with Thomas Merton,” they’ll say, referring to the Trappist monk and mystic. “Kneeling bags my nylons.” The best of these self-conscious comparisons may come from James Thurber, who was once asked to review Salvador Dalí’s autobiography. Comparing his own golden-hued Columbus, Ohio, upbringing with young Dalí’s chiaroscuro of ermine capes and necrophilia, Thurber wrote, “The naked truth about me is to the naked truth about Salvador Dalí as an old ukulele in the attic is to a piano in a tree, and I mean a piano with breasts.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/the-keillor-reader-by-garrison-keillor.html
2014-05-30,Appetites,"Ruth Reichl is known for many things, among them her best-selling memoirs, including “Tender at the Bone” and “Comfort Me With Apples,” as well as her years of reviewing restaurants for both The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, and as the editor in chief of the seemingly immortal Gourmet magazine — until it folded. With the arrival of Twitter, Reichl added another genre to her résumé: haiku-like paeans to breakfast in any weather: “Sunny in Charlotte. Returned to rain. Gray New York morning. Big bowl of ginger strewn congee. Chiles. Soy. Scallion. So consoled.” The next day, it was still raining, but once again food came to the rescue: “Gray drizzle. Umbrellas up. Sidewalks sloppy. Rye bread, still warm. Herring: pungent, rich. Sour cream. Onions. Solace in the city.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/ruth-reichls-delicious.html

2014-05-30,Get Down,"When I was growing up in Chicago, there was no rowdier time in our house than Friday night, when my mother, my three siblings and I stayed up to watch “Red Hot and Blues” on Channel 26, Chicago’s first UHF station. Part advertisement and part dance spectacle, it was our chance to celebrate the end of the week, listen and dance to our favorite R & B songs and howl at the cheesy commercials delivered by pitchmen selling used cars and ugly furniture: “You’ll do well to see Dell’s — Dell’s Furniture.” (Even hearing the voice was enough to send us all into fits of laughter.) Just as attractive as the music was the lineup of shabbily dressed kids from the West Side who gathered in front of the camera to dance — a great counterpart to us shabbily dressed kids from the South Side.

She likes to look at people who are used to being looked at, and she uses her camera like Wonder Woman’s golden lasso — as a truth-telling device that peels performance from personality. In one of her most famous photographs, “Tiny” (1983), a Seattle street kid poses in her Halloween costume: a little black dress, little black gloves and a hat with a netted veil. It’s the daintiness of Tiny’s dress combined with her defiance that gives the photograph its charge.

2014-05-30,Journey by Rail,"In an era of railway mediocrity, epitomized by Amtrak, it’s easy to forget that train travel was once a romantic adventure. Riding the rails to Boston in 1924, George Gershwin listened to the roar of the steam engine and the turn of the wheels and found the inspiration for “Rhapsody in Blue,” his hymn to urbanizing, Jazz Age America. “It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its rattle-ty bang, that is so often so stimulating to a composer,” he told a biographer, describing the moment of creation. “I frequently hear music in the very heart of the noise.” W. C. Handy and other African-American musicians heard a similar sound on the Illinois Central, the Midwestern line that spirited them away from the Deep South on the Great Migration that began during World War I. They married the whistle and drone of the locomotive to the plaintive chants of sharecroppers and invented the “city blues.” Steve Goodman, a little-known composer, was inspired by a ­journey on the same line to write a dirge that became one of the anthems of the Vietnam War era — “The City of New ­Orleans.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/tom-zoellners-train.html
2014-05-30,Not Just Laughs,"Christopher Buckley begins his new collection, “But Enough About You,” with an essay about the perils of being known as a humorist, the fear that people brand him as “trivial” and believe that what he and his literary forebears do is easy. “Well, only five paragraphs in and already wallowing in self-pity,” he writes. “We just can’t get no respect.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/but-enough-about-you-by-christopher-buckley.html

2014-05-30,Inside the List,"Hemingway on the Stoop: Near the beginning of “Sons of Wichita,” his biography of the politically influential Koch brothers — it’s No. 17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list — Daniel Schulman describes the conservative beliefs of the family patriarch, the industrialist Fred Koch. “Father was paranoid about Communism, let’s put it that way,” his son David Koch once told New York magazine, in a quote Schulman cites. Fred’s views filtered down to at least one of his four sons: Charles, the second-oldest and now the chief executive of Koch Industries, spent most of a blind date in the early 1960s railing against the evils of Communism, according to the biography. (“I ended up leaving early and walking home,” his date says.) Charles also let his politics spill over into literary criticism. Schulman, a senior editor at Mother Jones, reports that when a family friend showed up at the Koch house in the 1960s with a copy of “The Sun Also Rises,” Charles eyed the book apprehensively and finally asked the visitor to leave it outside.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/inside-the-list.html
