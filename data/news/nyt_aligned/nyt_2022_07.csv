Almost all the sailors experience a deep unease, “a sense of blasphemy,” at the act of capture: “So close, she was terrifying, a person there, no doubt about it; a trapped and dying woman.” The mermaid, Aycayia — huge, wounded, furious, utterly vulnerable, “crawling with sea-lice” — brings out powerful impulses in the men: to harm, to possess, to touch, to mark her, despite or even because of the hatred in her “tinfoil eyes.” This violent, mesmerizing scene begins “The Mermaid of Black Conch,” signaling the book’s ambition. Monique Roffey’s sixth novel is a fairy tale: The mermaid casts off her tail, regains her legs, falls in love, battles an ancient curse. But it is a ghost story too, the people and the very land of Black Conch haunted by the island’s legacy of colonialism and enslavement.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/03/books/review/mermaid-black-conch-roffey.html

This aside, it’s usually a matter of weighing the benefits — namely training and time and space to think and make work — against the often literal and sometimes substantial costs. There’s no clear answer, but what is clear is that art school alone cannot make you an artist, or shield you from self-doubt, uncertainty or rejection. Perhaps for this reason, some artists are most grateful for the sense of community provided by those they met while students — often a classmate or teacher becomes a lifelong friend, collaborator or mentor, someone who shows up regardless of the state of the other person’s career.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/t-magazine/should-i-go-to-art-school.html

2022-07-07,Poem: Sister Song,"The ghazal is a formal poem that has roots in seventh-century Arabia and was often sung by musicians. The poet Agha Shahid Ali introduced the form to America. “Ghazal” literally means “the cry of a gazelle” as it is being chased and about to die. Like many formal poems such as the sonnet, the ghazal, with its restrictions, can paradoxically illuminate and parse difficult emotions. In López’s poem, the emotion is grief — a longing for and memory of a murdered brother. This poem mostly follows the parameters of a ghazal with its repeated end word, “song,” and the inside rhyme of “forever,” “far,” “marred,” etc., as well as the poet’s name or reference to the poet (“Sister”) in the final line. One way this poem breaks the rules is that each couplet doesn’t stand alone as if it were its own poem. Instead, the end of the couplets often bleed into the next stanza, linking the narratives.

2022-07-07,The Nihilism of the Minions,"One of the peculiarities of the collective American memory is that we imagine that moral rigidity steadily declines over time. One generation, through experimentation and immense tolerance, disentangles the hang-ups of their parents, just as their children will ultimately do for them. This, of course, is nonsense. What’s particularly odd to me is that most of us are fully aware — at least on an intellectual level — that cultural moralizing ebbs and flows and there is no clear linearity to any of it. But we hold on to the idea that society got “freer” during our generation (whatever that means) because we want our own youthful indiscretions to have “pushed boundaries” (another useless phrase) and “changed the scope of what was possible” (ditto). And while we can usually imagine our own children will take that “freedom” even further, our narcissism forces us to worry that society will crumble as a result. We, in other words, believe we, and only we, have found the perfect level of moral decline.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/opinion/minions-movie-nihilism.html

Much of the reaction traces to Justice Clarence Thomas, who in his concurring opinion in Dobbs argued that “In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell.” It was a shot across the legal bow that prompted James Obergefell, one of the petitioners in Obergefell v. Hodges — the case that guaranteed same-sex couples a constitutional right to marry — to respond, in an interview on CNN last week, that Thomas had “put a target” on “the right to contraception, the right to intimacy with the person you love and the right to marry the person you love,” and “that should terrify everyone in this nation.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/opinion/roe-supreme-court.html

A shopping list that includes Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise, ponzu with yuzu, truffled vegetables and sauces, Moroccan spices, French pâtes de fruit and lovely gift boxes of Portuguese tinned sardines can easily be completed from its shelves. After living in the area during Covid, Charles de Viel Castel, a French-born financier, jewelry designer and entrepreneur, decided to fill a need he saw for products he could not find locally. His shop also sells baguettes from Armin & Judy, a nearby restaurant, and flower arrangements from the local florist Missi Flowers. The store is adjacent to a sliver of a market for baked goods and sandwiches from Pierre’s, a French restaurant, but Mr. de Viel Castel said the two shops seem to complement each other, not compete.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/dining/the-hamptons-lepicuriste.html

2022-07-15,Asian American Student Success Isn’t a Problem,"Over the past three years, as universities across the country have abandoned standardized test requirements and moved toward more holistic models for admission, a persistent yet largely unexamined question has arisen: Would these changes be happening if white students were at the top of the academic food chain? The performance gap between Asian American and white high school students on standardized tests has grown over the past decade. In 2018, for example, Asian American students, on average, scored 100 points higher on the SAT than white students. Just three years later, in 2021, that gap had risen by over 25 percent, to 127. Many of the universities that have dropped the SAT requirement have cited a desire for diversity and equity and a de-emphasis on hard-core academic competition. (This has always struck me as errant and, frankly, self-serving reasoning. If elite colleges actually want economically and racially diverse campuses free from the academic stressors that plague high school students, they should take their own advice and stop competing so fiercely to prove that they are the most exclusive places of higher learning in the world.)",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/opinion/asian-american-student-success.html

In a poem called “The First Number Will Be a Blues,” Sommer Browning describes one version of this story: “Before we’re born, my mother tells us, / We watch movies of every life we might be born into. Then we choose. / The little baby points from her / astral cradle.” The speaker marvels at the implications: “I choose that mama. / I choose that daddy. / I choose that irrevocably broken marriage, / That accident that wires my jaw shut, / That burned popcorn” — the litany continues — “That root canal, that unending night on mushrooms, / That dog bite.” “That DUI.” Is it absurd to imagine we select our own pattern of suffering, or that we might have picked a life without any? As Willard Spiegelman notes in his book “Seven Pleasures,” “‘Hap’ means chance.” Happiness and happen share the same root. Whether we choose them or not, the random happenings of our lives, good and bad, are our own. The details that add up to days and years — your street name, your first word, your favorite podcast — have what Ernest Becker might have called a “cosmic specialness.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/books/review/chance-design-and-inevitability-in-three-new-poetry-books.html

A big year was 1984, with the openings of the Sea Grill and American Festival Cafe by Restaurant Associates. This year promises to be notable as well, with Tishman Speyer, the company that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, continuing to shape the dining scene. A major addition is Le Rock, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr’s grand interpretation of a French brasserie. (Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr, veterans of Balthazar, own Frenchette in TriBeCa and have Le Veau d’Or on the Upper East Side in the wings.) With Workstead, a Brooklyn interior design studio, they have incorporated enough Art Deco features to anchor the soaring room to its historic setting. A verdigris screen separates the bar, terrazzo floors are new but don’t look it and bare burled wood tables sit at forest-green leather banquettes. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have to fill 130 seats indoors with another 70 on the terrace, and, to do so, especially with a potential tourist audience, they have given an international spin to the menu. “We’ve gone simpler than Frenchette, which has its own personality,” Mr. Hanson said. Mr. Nasr cited some classic brasserie items, like leeks vinaigrette, escargots, pâté maison and steak au poivre (made with bison). They share a menu, divided into Cette Semaine (weekly specials) and Tout le Temps (every day), which also lists falafel, a brochette of calamari and shishito peppers, and barbajuans, a kind of fried ravioli. Some items play it coy, using untranslated French names, like tablier de sapeur (breaded tripe) and cervelle de canut (fresh herbed cheese). In charge of the kitchen as executive chef is Walker Stern, a former owner of Battersby and Dover in Brooklyn. Mariah Neston is collaborating with Michelle Palazzo, the head pastry chef, on site to create a giant baba au rhum carved tableside.

I alerted the flight attendant, who alerted the gate staff, who in turn suggested I get off the plane, get my luggage and fly the next day. But there are limited connections, I had to get to work and I had no idea where my second bag was. (Also lost, it turns out.) Thirteen days and countless calls and letters later, Astana delivered my luggage in Kazakhstan. United eventually offered me $150 in compensation. I believe this is not nearly enough, especially considering their policy on “delayed bags” says I may be eligible for $1,500 per bag if they can’t find my luggage in five days.
