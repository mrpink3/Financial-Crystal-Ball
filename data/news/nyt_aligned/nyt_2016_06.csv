2016-06-01,National Briefing,"Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on Tuesday encouraged the state’s 1,200 school districts to defy the Obama administration and ignore a directive calling on schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. Last week, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration over the federal recommendation to United States public schools earlier this month. Mr. Patrick, a Republican, who has previously said Texas is willing to forfeit $10 billion in federal education funding rather than comply, said he was sending a letter to all school districts this week emphasizing that the state would support schools that defied the directive. “Transgender students deserve the rights of anyone else,’’ he said. It does not mean they get to use the girls’ room if they’re a boy.” Several parents of transgender students criticized his comments. “You, specifically you, are endangering my child’s life,” said Ann Elder, the mother of a 10-year-old transgender child near Houston. “You have now told everyone in the state of Texas it is O.K. to harass my child.” Also Tuesday, a federal appeals court said it would not reconsider a three-judge panel’s ruling that a transgender teenager must be allowed to use the boys’ restroom at a Virginia school. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit denied the Gloucester County School Board’s appeal of a case brought by a student at Gloucester High School.

But what the country lacks in height, it makes up for with saunas: There are 3.3 million of them, roughly one per household. But when Loyly, a commanding new structure built along the edge of the Baltic Sea, opened last week, it became Helsinki’s first true public sauna. It has all the hallmarks of a true sauna, which until now have been relegated to Finns’ homes: It is heated by wood, features smoke and has an accessible body of water to jump into at the end. Jasper Paakkonen, a Finnish actor, avid environmentalist and partner in the project, thinks of the shell-like design as a “tunturi,” the Finnish word for something that’s between a hill and a mountain (which stands out on the flat terrain). And the word loyly translates as the steam radiating from the rocks when you throw water on the hot stones in the sauna.

2016-06-01,"Horror: Joyce Carol Oates’s ‘The Doll-Master and Other Tales of Terror,’ and More","Fifty years and millions of words ago, when Joyce Carol Oates was in her late 20s, she wrote a story about an unhappy teenager named Connie who accepts a ride, unwisely, from a dark, glib young man who calls himself Arnold Friend, and although that story, “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?,” is scrupulously realistic, it is also a classic tale of horror. It is, in its chillingly objective way, scarier than anything in Oates’s new collection, THE DOLL-MASTER AND OTHER TALES OF TERROR (Mysterious Press, $24) — which, as it happens, contains a story about another teenage girl who gets in the wrong car. The smooth-talking male predator in this new one, “Big Momma,” keeps a very large metaphor as a house pet: the title character is a 20-foot-long reticulated python. There’s nothing of the supernatural in either story, or for that matter in any of the “tales of terror” in the present collection, but Oates’s brand of horror has never required the invocation of other worlds: This world is terrible enough for her. Everything she writes, in whatever genre, has an air of dread, because she deals in vulnerabilities and inevitabilities, in the desperate needs that drive people like Connie and poor young Violet of “Big Momma” to their fates. A sense of helplessness is the essence of horror, and Oates conveys that feeling as well as any writer around, whether the powerlessness in question is that of a victim or, as in the title story of “The Doll-Master,” that of someone who is unable to stop doing harm to others: Obsession can be a kind of vulnerability, too.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/horror-joyce-carol-oatess-the-doll-master-and-other-tales-of-terror-and-more.html

One of its tracks, “Kick in the Door,” sampled the song “I Put a Spell on You.” I already knew (and loved) the Nina Simone version, but until then I had no idea she was covering Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’s only hit record. “I Put a Spell on You” is lyrically dark, the offbeat tale of a heartbroken lover (or obsessive stalker, depending on your point of view) who resorts to magic to get his partner back. The song, like Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and also strangely like Biggie himself, at once defied and cradled conventional understandings of comedy, tragedy, “authentic” black male voice and “authentic” black male performance.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/screamin-jay-hawkins-all-time-greatest-hits-by-mark-binelli.html

The clothes — shown in the Palace’s famously long library, which houses 10,000 books and portraits by Joshua Reynolds and John Singer Sargent — didn’t shy away from opulence either. “The collection is very elaborate so we wanted to do something on the face that was calm and linear to balance it out.” He applied a dark, reddish-chocolate eye shadow from the Dior 5 Couleurs Skyline Edition n°506 Parisian Sky palette, and packed it up to the eyebrows. (The brown shadow was a nod to the collection, which featured the same tone.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/t-magazine/fashion/beauty-dior-cruise-show-bella-hadid.html

I imagine because it’s functional and people sometimes don’t like to see the value in something you can use as much as something you can put on a wall,” says Catherine Lock, co-founder of the New Craftsmen, a unique space in London dedicated to selling and promoting the work of small-scale British artisans. “I see craft as art we can live with in a real way.” After working as a product developer at the popular English home décor chain Habitat and for the British Council promoting local designers of all sorts at home and abroad, Lock spotted a gap in the market for a business that sold handmade works such as ceramics and textiles in the elevated, curated manner of an art gallery. In 2012, the then-39-year-old toured the U.K. for five months searching every remote corner of the country for hidden talent — a pair of potters from the isolated wilds of Wales, a furniture maker from the misty forests of Kent, a textile designer working in the smallest of studios in East London — to sell in a temporary space she secured in London’s Mayfair neighborhood. “I went where the wind took me. One artist would tell me about another,” says Lock. “I was hunting for objects but it also ended up being a journey into my own culture. What I’m doing is as much about what goes on our shelves as the stories of the people making these wonderful things.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/t-magazine/design/british-crafts-store-mayfair.html

That square eventually became the basis for Monkey Town: four movie screens cocooning a private loft in East Williamsburg, within which sat four long tables catered by Michelin-starred chefs moonlighting at the space from around the city. “I just thought it would be cool to construct narratives on multiple screens,” Knott recalls. “But the concept of an audience facing each other, watching things in front of them while others watch things behind them, was much more powerful than I ever imagined.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/t-magazine/entertainment/film-restaurant-popup-monkey-town-downtown-la.html

2016-06-02,Five Super-Simple Swimsuit Brands to Know,"Since launching her eponymous line in 2012, the designer Shaina Mote has won die-hard fans, who rely on the Los Angeles-based label for its versatile, elevated basics. Those fans, however, have had to fend for themselves in the swimwear category — until now. Today, Mote launches a capsule line of swimwear that stays true to the distinctive, functional aesthetic she’s perfected in her main line. The expansion was borne out of Mote’s struggle to find a suit that fit into her own life: “I felt there was a little bit of a void for a type of swimwear that can be used in an active environment as well as one that’s leisurely,” she says. To fulfill that mandate, Mote created a six-piece collection, which was inspired by the clean lines found in the work of the Mexican architect Luis Barragán. One innovation she struck upon: She eliminated the top stitch typically found on swimsuits, so that each style would “mesh into the body, and lie more flush with the skin.” With so much attention paid to the fit and cut, it’s no wonder Mote decided to keep the color palette as simple as possible. Every piece in the line, which has been crafted from dead-stock Italian fabric, is black. “I wanted to make sure I was presenting the customer with something that was really accessible and travels well,” she says. “Since this is my first swimwear collection, I really wanted to nail down those basics and core styles.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/t-magazine/fashion/five-swimsuit-brands.html

Ground control then postponed the linkup indefinitely, leaving open the possibility that Lt. Comdr. Cernan might be sent into space to dislodge the shroud.

Set in a fictional version of Danny Meyer’s Union Square Cafe, where Danler was hired after arriving in the city in 2006, the book features lots of casual sex and substance abuse — think of it as a female version of “Bright Lights, Big City,” with professional kitchens instead of magazine offices as a backdrop. “I would always think to myself as I was waiting tables,” Danler told NPR last month, “if the guests had any idea of the rich life that is going on behind the scene and the drama and the sexual tension and the sadness and the joy and the friendship — I think that those currents add a lot of energy to restaurants. Like, I prefer to dine in places where I can feel the staff a little bit, they have a little bit of a personality. But I hadn’t ever seen it written about.

2016-06-06,1941: Germans Raid Egypt,"LONDON — Germany has begun her direct offensive against Egypt and the Suez Canal. That was the interpretation in well informed quarters tonight [June 5] of the Nazi raid last night on Alexandria, Great Britain’s main naval base in the eastern Mediterranean. More than one hundred persons were killed and hundreds of others were wounded. One of Fuehrer Adolf Hitler’s first objectives, following the capture of Crete, would be to render untenable the British naval headquarters in Egypt, cripple the Royal Navy and leave Germany in control of the eastern Mediterranean, informed circles at London declared. The more the Nazis could disorganize the British fleet’s positions in those waters the easier a sea invasion of Cyprus and Syria would become, it was pointed out. It was believed here that last night’s attack on Alexandria was the forerunner of increasingly heavy bombing raids on that port. The Nazi planes, operating, it is believed from airports in Greece and the Dodecanese Islands, poured tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs on Alexandria, according to a communiqué issued by the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior. Many buildings were destroyed in the ninety-minute raid. — New York Herald Tribune, June 6, 1941",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/1941-germans-raid-egypt/

2016-06-08,Mecca Goes Mega,"In the days before rapid sea or air travel, it could take months to travel to Mecca. The spiritual heart of Islam lay far from its great capitals in Istanbul, Delhi and Isfahan. The devout came from distant lands on foot, by camel and in horse-drawn carriages. Bedouin tribes routinely robbed these pilgrims, who were the primary source of revenue for this ancient desert town. Now, the ease of air travel and the rise of a global Muslim middle class have made the journey to Mecca far less arduous and far more common. Last year, three million came for the hajj, a pilgrimage in the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar that is considered obligatory for every Muslim who can afford it; five million more came for the umrah, a minor pilgrimage that can be made for much of the year. And millions of Saudi citizens routinely pass through Mecca’s sacred sites as tourists.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/mecca-goes-mega.html

To my mind, no book better encapsulates this spirit than “More Than I Dreamed: A Lifetime of Collecting,” by Malcolm Forbes, whose deliriously materialistic account of his own life gives the lie to the notion that success is its own end. It’s quite clear that stuff, more than anything else, made Malcolm Forbes happy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/malcolm-forbes-more-than-i-dreamed.html

It keeps the jewels safe, whilst at the same time showing them off.” Normally positioned on the dressing table of her home outside Fontainebleau in northern France — “I believe jewelry should be seen, not stored away out of sight” — it will be on view for the first time this week alongside more than 50 small sculptures and jewels at the Louisa Guinness gallery in London. The display comes ahead of a presentation of the artist’s large-scale sculpture by Guinness’s husband, the gallerist Ben Brown, later this year.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/t-magazine/art/copper-jewelry-box-claude-lalanne.html

Adams calls the work a “series finale” of his ongoing reanimations of television culture, and in some ways it’s almost antithetical to the format of normal small-screen programming. Performers are mostly untrained (with the exception of a few burgeoning talents like Suzi Analog and Jahmir Duran Abreu), there is no script and the live performance, happening on Friday for the show’s opening, is entirely improvised, including Adams’s own act. The work is designed to allow the performers “to feel the space,” he says. “I want it to seem very fresh and not polished.” (See a teaser for the work, below.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/t-magazine/art/derrick-adams-television-art-show.html

2016-06-09,The American Way of Drinking,"What would it mean to have a national drink? In May, the brewing company Anheuser-Busch announced that it would temporarily rename its best-known product. From the summer until Election Day in November, Budweiser beer will instead be called “America,” and the new name will be splashed across its red-white-and-blue labels and cans as part of its “America is in your hands” campaign. To my ears, the language sounds ambiguous at best, and at worst downright ominous. Or opportunistic. Or cynical. Or something else I don’t particularly want in my beer glass. But the rebranding of Bud did compel me to think about this notion of an American beverage, and to pull down from my bookshelf the delightful (and often delightfully overwrought) 1953 compendium “The American Drink Book,” by S.S.

In March, you wrote about the bad ways that people are opposing his campaign; you didn’t like that ad with women reading the horrible things he’s said about women. Is there an effective way to oppose him? Trump and his campaign are perfectly positioned to exploit every weakness we have in the electorate. If the Republican Party didn’t want to have this opposition, they should have picked literally any type of policy and just made it happen, even as late as last summer. If voters could have seen that the Republican Party was capable of doing something big and dramatic, and communicated that to the people, I don’t think that you would have had the hunger to blow up the system like with the Trump movement.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/mollie-hemingway-hates-how-feminists-talk-about-sex.html

Mr. Espinosa, not quite 19, is a nonsinging Justin Bieber look-alike and a Magcon boy. What, you don’t know the Magcon boys? They’re young social media stars, best known through Vine, who make harmless videos and attract the aforementioned vocal legion of admirers.

The Great Seljuq Empire, which occupied most of western Asia and the Middle East from around 1040 to 1157, was among the more short-lived, and it left a comparatively modest material inheritance. But if the Seljuq dynasty produced nothing so grand as the pyramids, the Parthenon or the Taj Mahal, it nevertheless presided over a cosmopolitan multicultural age of terrific artistic and intellectual vitality and innovation.

Vision, overseen by the artist-run nonprofit organization Arts for Art, draws on the spirit of cooperative, self-determined, experimental jazz as an aesthetic, an ethic and a continuity, extending back to the 1960s — primarily to the New York version of such music and events, but also to kindred scenes in Chicago and elsewhere.

2016-06-10,National Briefing,"Roman Catholic legislators say they have been publicly shamed during Mass and disinvited from parish events as the Philadelphia Archdiocese campaigns against a bill that would give victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue the church. State Representative Nick Miccarelli said he was shocked to learn that the weekly bulletin at his church targeted him. Under the headline “Just So You Are Aware,” the announcement read, “State Representative Miccarelli voted in favor of House Bill 1947, which states that private institutions can be sued as far as 40 years ago for millions of dollars, while public institutions may not be sued for any crimes.” Last weekend, a letter by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput was given to all 219 archdiocese parishes urging parishioners to ask their state senators to vote against the bill. Archbishop Chaput wrote that potential lawsuits would unfairly affect schools and parishes that had nothing to do with the long-ago abuse. He also said the financial ramifications could cripple the ministry. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill in April, and it is being considered by the Senate.

This is because she needs her sleep. She doesn’t always seem tired. But sleep is sacred to her, and you must never interfere with it. Particularly in the mornings. This makes life complicated if your bedroom — the nursery — is directly above hers and the floors are covered in linoleum, as they are in London in the 1960s. When you wake up and need to go to the bathroom you must avoid certain creaky spots. So you navigate like a cat burglar, tiptoeing on the more solid sections until you get to the stairs down to the bathroom. You hold your breath as you pee as if not breathing will somehow mitigate the sound. Do you flush?

2016-06-10,The Unconsciously Chic Influences of Sigmund Freud’s Great-Granddaughter,"Before the advent of hashtags and the surplus of shirts that tout them, the English designer Bella Freud was working with wordplay. Knitted with phrases like “Ginsberg is God,” “Dad” (her father is Lucien Freud) and “Psychoanalysis” (her great-grandfather is Sigmund), her sloganed sweaters have been a hit for more than a decade. Freud’s influences — French New Wave power couples, Rastafarians — are as unexpected as her androgynous hippie look. The 55-year-old, who has a teenage son with the writer James Fox, has made short films with John Malkovich and even penned a column on beauty for The Sunday Telegraph. Now, she’s thinking about starting a line of pajamas and bedding. “I’m always rummaging around markets for vintage striped sheets,” Freud says. “I’m currently in love with the idea of making all the things I want to have in my home.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/t-magazine/fashion/bella-freud-fashion-designer.html

2016-06-10,Inside the List,"Bad News: On the surface, Noah Hawley’s novel “Before the Fall” — new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 — is a standard thriller: It opens with the crash of a private jet off Martha’s Vineyard, then backs up to examine the lives of the passengers in an effort to figure out what went wrong. Dig a little deeper, though, and the book turns out to contain an unexpected strand of media criticism. David Bateman, who hired the jet, runs a television station very like Fox News, and one of the novel’s main story lines involves the efforts of his channel’s populist blowhard anchor to demonize a survivor. “It’s definitely a look at the dangers of personality-driven media,” Hawley told USA Today last month. “We have these personas like O’Reilly or Chris Matthews or Megyn Kelly, the people who in some ways become the story as well.” But Hawley (who, as the showrunner for “Fargo” on FX, works in the same Rupert Murdoch-owned universe as Fox News) emphasized that he had no particular models in mind. “My job as a novelist isn’t to draw a thinly veiled version of real people and institutions,” he told me via email. “It is to try to find the truth of a thing by recreating it in a different form.” In this case, he added, the goal was to point out the danger of leaping to conclusions based on limited facts: “What happened? What does it mean? These are different questions. Historically the news media’s role was to answer the first and leave the second to informed viewers. But somewhere around the turn of the century a shift occurred. Our news now comes prefiltered for ‘meaning,’ the ‘relevant’ facts arranged to fit a certain worldview — conservative, liberal — and then delivered as if they were objective truth. Facts that don’t fit that worldview are left out. As a result, conservative people live in a different America than liberal people. Not only can we no longer agree on the meaning of events. We literally can’t agree on the events themselves.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/books/review/inside-the-list.html

In the case of the telephone, this has been nothing short of revolutionary, but no other “smart” object has managed to replicate its success. The absurdity of the phenomenon was made unavoidably apparent in May, when a start-up unveiled a “smart tampon,” called my.Flow.

Inspired by Schwitters’s destroyed “Merzbau” (1923-1937), an ever-changing collage sculpture that consumed his entire workspace, Hadid designed an all-encompassing grotto on which to show the artist’s works. As with the “Merzbau,” Hadid’s structural collage includes artworks as well as “readymade” furniture and architectural features. Here, the artworks are assemblages and reliefs from across Schwitters’s career, as well as a selection of illustrated and often surreal personal correspondence.

Curated by the institution’s own Aram Moshayedi with Hamza Walker from Chicago’s Renaissance Society, this year’s show is tighter than previous iterations in the number of artists featured — just 26 — but somehow more expansive in the breadth of disciplines and practices that are integrated. Case in point: The subtitle of the show is itself an artwork: a poem by the biennial’s most senior artist, the minimalist writer Aram Saroyan. It goes “a, the, though, only,” a string of words that evoke particularity and universality at the same time.

2016-06-17,One Man’s Quest to Get Americans to Care About Rugby,"He was hard-pressed to explain it even to himself. Possibly the whole idea was daft. His “rugby dream,” the aspiration to start a professional rugby league in North America, had taken over his life. It had him raiding his bank account to pay for logos, trademarks, websites. For visa specialists, branding wizards, a high-powered sports lawyer. It had him hacking through jungles of marketing jargon. His Midtown Manhattan office was cluttered with cartons of new business cards, boxes of hats, sample jerseys. There was a litter of unorganized receipts on the desk. In 18 months he’d racked up 250,000 frequent flier miles. He’d watched the Rugby World Cup in London from the Royal Box at Olympic Stadium; someone joked he could plunge New Zealand into a national depression if he lured their stars to America. He’d delved into venue contracts, hot-dog sales projections and turf heights on rugby-compliant fields. In conversation after conversation, on the phone, by email and in person, at mixers and conferences, in airports and foyers and hallways, he pitched his plans, parried critics and cajoled skeptics into the fold. Some guardians of amateur rugby were threatened by the prospect of losing prized club players to a pro league. Some just wondered who the hell he was — Douglas Schoninger, a not-particularly-athletic 55-year-old former bond trader who had never played rugby, who dimly remembered seeing a few games 30 or 40 years ago but didn’t know a ruck from a maul or a lock from a hooker until he bought a copy of “Rugby Union for Dummies.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/magazine/one-mans-quest-to-get-americans-to-care-about-rugby.html

Earlier this week, the artist, wearing an equally dark linen suit, was unperturbed by the fact that two trees were still at large, en route from London where they went on view last summer as part of his blockbuster show at the Royal Academy. Before that, they’d been hidden inside his Beijing studio for years. “We’ve been getting a tree a day,” quipped John Tancock, the guest-curator of “Ai Weiwei: Trees and Cubes,” which opens today. During the installation, the artist caught up with T — until being stopped short by a fire alarm.

Without defending what the officer had done, Mr. Bratton spoke of the practice of ordinary people filming unsettling behavior by the police as a “very serious” issue that had reached “epidemic” levels in this country.

That was four days after Brown-Simpson, 35, and her friend Ronald Goldman, 25, were found dead in pools of blood, nearly decapitated.

2016-06-17,Inside the List,"Pop Poet: Who says nobody reads poetry anymore? On the paperback trade fiction list, a debut collection called “Milk and Honey,” by the Canadian writer Rupi Kaur, is going strong at No. 8 after nine weeks. Kaur is a 23-year-old social media phenom from Toronto who gained attention last year when she fought Instagram’s removal of a photo she posted showing menstrual blood. As her audience grew — she now has 475,000 followers on Instagram and 34,500 on Twitter — Kaur earned a reputation not only for her photos and ­sketches but also for brief, plain-­spoken ­poems tackling feminism, love, trauma and healing in short lines that can be as smooth as pop music (“love will hold you / love will call your name”) or as jagged as rusty metal (“the hurt / the loss / the pain / the breaking”). Much of Kaur’s appeal comes from this artless vulnerability, like a cross between Charles Bukowski and Cat Power, and from an ingénue’s willingness to blurt out whatever is on her mind. “I was always writing for myself,” she told The Times of India this month. “I wrote what I needed to write and hear — that’s what makes it powerful. And it’s this honesty that has got me where I am today.” Well, that and some serious marketing savvy: Besides “Milk and Honey,” which she initially self-­published, visitors to Kaur’s website can also buy jars of artisanal honey branded with her name, “from the hives of distinguished queen bees.” And she has ideas about how to expand her reach. “There have been articles saying that all women need to read my book,” she told The Times of India. “I ask, why not all men? In fact, that would be even more valuable because we women want to sit down with men and tell them — this is how we feel, this is what we go through.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Some have pointed to 1976, when Republicans were split in two and had to settle their differences at the national convention that summer. Others point to the chaos and violence of 1968. But a more pertinent example may be the election of 1936. The country was lifting itself out of the Great Depression, helped by the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, but the climb back to prosperity was long and slow, and a mood of populist unrest began to steal across the land. “The followers of the demagogues mostly came from the old lower-middle classes, now in an unprecedented stage of frustration and fear, menaced by humiliation, dispossession and poverty,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in “The Politics of Upheaval,” published in 1960. “They came from provincial and traditionally nonpolitical groups in the population, jolted from apathy into near-hysteria by the shock of economic collapse.” Many also “came from the evangelical denominations; years of Bible reading and fundamentalist revivalism had accustomed them to millennial solutions.” Outsider candidates became the vehicles of an existential protest, “Old America in resentful revolt against both contemporary politics and contemporary economics.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/books/review/what-do-this-seasons-political-books-tell-us-about-the-election.html

The local and state authorities had ruled that the death was an accident, concluding that Mr. Johnson had been unable to breathe after getting stuck upside down in the middle of the rolled-up mat while reaching for a gym shoe. But his parents insisted that someone must have killed their son, and they pushed to reopen the investigation. They got a judge’s order to exhume the body so a second autopsy could be performed. The private pathologist hired by the family reported finding hemorrhaging beneath the skin of Mr. Johnson’s jaw and neck and concluded that he had suffered a fatal blow near his carotid artery that appeared to be “nonaccidental.” The Justice Department said an independent federal investigation had “found insufficient evidence” to support federal criminal charges.

So they set out — and, on the way, meet all sorts of characters. Eventually a crow advises them to climb a high tree in an attempt to spot the land of their dreams from above. At the top, they marvel at the amazing view and see an abandoned cabin by a river. They decide that the spot is so beautiful that it must be Panama.

As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire, a haze of myth starts to gather over the action, a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection: The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away, using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/movies/free-state-of-jones-review-matthew-mcconaughey.html

Ms. Lively’s character, Nancy, is not a tech addict, as such: She’s looking at pictures of her mother, now dead, who was pregnant with her when she visited the secret Mexican beach Nancy is now seeking. Once she hits the sand, Nancy proves game and capable and in the moment. After using the phone one more time, to check in with her little sister and her dad for some back story, she tethers herself to her surfboard, puts on the top half of a wet suit, and hits the waves.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/movies/the-shallows-review-blake-lively.html

Few westerns set in the American Old West, though, make it to the big screen anymore, and those that do — “The Lone Ranger,” “The Hateful Eight” — tend to be under-loved, under-seen or both.

Charming and funny, it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says, Yes, I’ll love him.

2016-06-24,Inside the List,"Man in Motion: The singer Bobby Brown has a memoir on this week’s ­hardcover nonfiction list — “Every Little Step,” co-written with Nick Chiles, debuts at No. 9. Brown rose to fame with New Edition in the 1980s before drug problems and a turbulent marriage to Whitney Houston made him a mainstay of police blotters, cementing his tabloid reputation as “the bad boy of R&B.” Those days are behind him now, according to the memoir, but Brown is still willing to share the wild details. Among frank ­passages about liaisons with Madonna, Janet Jackson and an entertainer at his bachelor party (“Let me say the night with the midget blew my mind”), Brown casually announces he’s also had a close encounter of the paranormal kind: “One memorable night, one of the ghosts ­descended from the ceiling and had sex with me. . . . And let me add this: This was before I ever touched any drug besides weed and alcohol.” The book isn’t all sex and drugs, though. There’s plenty of rock ’n’ roll, too. “My God, funk was everything to me,” Brown says of his listening habits when he was growing up in Boston. “When I put on the funk, I’d start the dancing.” He adds that, in the rough projects where he lived, his sense of rhythm offered him a kind of protection. “Although violence was always around us, one of the main ways I battled back then was not with my fists — it was with my dance moves. I wasn’t necessarily confident about my singing yet, but I knew I could whup anybody’s ass in a dance battle. . . . Break dancing, pop locking — man, I was unbelievable.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2016-06-24,Artist to Know: The 29-Year-Old Effortlessly Melding Science and Romance,"A wall-shuddering heartbeat reverberates down the pitch-black hall that leads to Marguerite Humeau’s solo exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. An ominous lit sign reading “FOXP2,” the name of the show, marks the entryway into the surgery-bright antechamber that the 29-year-old artist describes as her “biological showroom.” Inspired by car fairs and grocery stores, the extreme environment sets the tone for Humeau’s fourth-ever solo show, spurred by her interest in what she calls “luminous horror.” “It’s trying to create things that at first look very bright and attractive, but are actually horrific. Luminosity is something I think of when looking at the Apple store; they sell light,” Humeau says. “To me, it’s the same premise that many religions have sold: to become immortal, you have to become immaterial.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/t-magazine/art/paris-elephant-sculptures-marguerite-humeau.html

2016-06-28,Aska Gives Its New-Nordic Food a New Home,"Aska Fredrik Berselius’s decision to use the name of his last restaurant for his next one came late in the game. And it was one of the few easy parts of building and opening the new place. The tall, lanky Swedish chef, who closed his much-lauded new-Nordic restaurant two years ago, went through months of searching for space, then ran into complications with construction. Now, almost a year late, the square black room, one corner of which is taken up with an open kitchen, is ready. “I did not want one of those long, narrow dining rooms,” Mr. Berselius said. The restaurant has a spacious garden and a downstairs white-brick bar and lounge. (The dining room has no bar, like a growing number of restaurants.) For his 12- to 15-course tasting menus, which change daily, he is considering dishes like hake smoked in hay, and dry-aged beef with cured beef fat and salted gooseberries. Mr. Berselius is planning to find as many ingredients as possible in the Northeast; caviar from Finland will be one of his few imports.

2016-06-29,Morning Agenda:  Banking in the Time of ‘Brexit’,"BANKING IN THE TIME OF ‘BREXIT’ Asian and European stocks rallied on Wednesday as the immediate effects of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union eased a little, Reuters reports. The pound continued to slide before steadying later in the day.Market sentiment was improved by assurances of support from central banks, but uncertainty meant that haven assets like gold and the yen continued to advance.European Union leaders are gathered for the second day of a summit meeting in Brussels to discuss Britain’s withdrawal and leaders were keen on Tuesday to make sure that Britain and any others tempted to follow in its path knew that leaving would carry a heavy price, as Andrew Higgins and James Kanter report in The New York Times.Shares in banks like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Barclays recovered some ground on Tuesday, but fears about their ability to sell billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities have not waned, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook.One of the best ways to assess a bank’s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which are so opaque and complex they trade rarely, if at all. Risk managers have to literally guess how much a Level 3 asset is worth.According to their annual reports in 2015, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets. Reflecting investor concern about the risky assets they own, these three banks trade at a steep discount to their book value. And there are few signs that the selling will let up, as hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.Concern about Britain’s future in Europe and its place as a financial hub has made it even harder to offload these securities.” All this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,” Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of Tübingen, said. “And because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. It’s very dangerous for the banks.”Credit default swaps tied to the creditworthiness of European banks do provide some reassurance, Peter Eavis writes in The Upshot. The cost of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging. Of course, the cost of the swaps is still much higher than the was the day before the referendum.But it is not Europe’s Lehman Brothers moment, Neil Irwin writes in The Upshot. After Lehman’s bankruptcy, banks hoarded cash and became reluctant to lend to anyone. There are few signs of that happening in response to Britain’s vote to leave the bloc.The premium that banks charge to lend to one another rose much more after Lehman’s collapse than it has done in Britain since last week. Banks still face huge costs as they consider whether to relocate from London to Europe, but it appears that investors still believe that they will weather the storm.In the United States, the Federal Reserve will tell the nation’s largest banks on Wednesday whether they passed or failed their annual stress tests. All banks proved their resilience in the first round of results, Gina Chon writes in Breakingviews.And as lenders have become better at passing these exams, their payouts have improved. They may be able to continue that this year, but not as much as might be suggested by improved economic conditions, Ms. Chon writes. Britain’s looming exit from the European Union adds another layer of caution.",Blogs,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/morning-agenda-banking-in-the-time-of-brexit/

2016-06-29,"‘Alpha, Bravo, Charlie’ and ‘Daytime Visions’","At a moment when communication seems to have been taken over by all things digital, alphabet books are holding strong. In fact they just keep getting more sophisticated. Sara Gillingham’s “Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,” to take one innovative example, packs quite a pleasurable wallop. It’s a big, well-organized compendium of how messages are sent and received at sea, working through the phonetic alphabet — the Alpha, Bravo, Charlie system of the title — as well as Morse code, signal flags, and the extremely old-school semaphore system, in which letters are represented by a person holding two flags in specific positions. Each page contains a wealth of clearly explained information that ties together all the nautical communication systems, adding for good measure other useful maritime facts. The page for “I,” for example, shows the flag “India,” which means “I am turning left.” We also learn that boats can use Morse code to send the same message by giving two blasts, and we get a trick for remembering left (port) from right (starboard): “A ship that is sailing out to the ocean has ‘left port.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/books/review/alpha-bravo-charlie-and-daytime-visions.html

2016-06-30,National Briefing,"Residents of Kansas, Georgia and Alabama will have to prove they are citizens when registering to vote for federal elections using a national form, a judge ruled Wednesday. Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court sided against voting rights groups that sued a federal elections official who changed the proof-of-citizenship requirements on the federal registration form at the request of the three states and without public notice. Residents of other states need only to swear that they are citizens. The judge refused to issue a temporary injunction sought by voting rights advocates to overturn the move by Brian Newby, executive director of the United States Election Assistance Commission, until the case can be decided at trial. The groups said Mr. Newby’s February action contradicts the commission’s mission to provide an easy form to encourage voter registration. They argue the proof-of-citizenship requirements hurt their ability to conduct registration drives and deprive eligible voters of the right to vote.

You see, much of the discussion of Brexit and its impacts bothers me. I believe that Brexit is a tragic development, which will do substantial long-run economic harm. But what we’re hearing overwhelmingly from economists is the claim that it will also have severe short-run adverse impacts. And that claim seems dubious.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/the-macroeconomics-of-brexit-motivated-reasoning/
2016-07-01,Review: Revisiting an Unlikely Campaign in ‘Roseanne for President!’,"Politics meets celebrity in Eric Weinrib’s fascinating documentary “Roseanne for President!,” a record of Roseanne Barr’s pursuit of a spot on the Green Party’s national ticket in 2012. Ms. Barr, of course, starred in the groundbreaking, Emmy-winning sitcom “Roseanne” (1988-1997), one of the first network shows to include gay characters and offer a comparatively realistic depiction of a working-class family.

The company is playing Alexei Ratmansky’s production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” new last year; the choreography, to a large extent, is not Mr. Ratmansky’s but by Marius Petipa, restored from records of the 1890 original and with a startling command of period style. Experienced dancers have matured. Multiple interpreters have found different rewards from the same roles. The production, running all this week at the tail end of Ballet Theater’s eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House, is looking even better than it did in its premiere season.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/arts/dance/review-sleeping-beauty-american-ballet-theater-ratmansk-metropolitan-opera.html

It’s no wonder that so many journalists love playing make-believe producers, as when they write that the news they’re covering “has all the makings of a Hollywood movie.” These days, though, the major American movie studios are more in the business of comic-book intrigues than in realism.
