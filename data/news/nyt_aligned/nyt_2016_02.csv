2016-02-01,Janet Napolitano Reviews Peter Bergen’s ‘United States of Jihad’,"Who constitutes a homegrown jihadist, and what distinguishes the terrorist attack in San Bernardino from the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School? In post-9/11 America, questions like these shape our national discourse on terrorism, law enforcement and public safety. Peter Bergen, CNN’s national security analyst and the author of four other books on terrorism, addresses these and other salient questions in his excellent new “United States of Jihad: Investigating America’s Homegrown Terrorists.” Bergen seeks to understand why some Americans choose to become jihadists, how our institutions have responded to terrorism and how American society has been changed by terrorist threats. Terrorism has long existed in this country — Bergen describes the 1970s as the “golden age” of terrorism in the United States — but the horrific attacks of Sept. 11 and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives on American soil were to earlier terrorist attacks as a tsunami is to a high tide. Just as a tsunami leaves a landscape forever altered once it retreats, so too has Sept. 11 fundamentally changed America. The difficulty Bergen faces in mapping and analyzing post-9/11 homegrown terrorism is the ever shifting, contemporaneous terrain of his subject — it’s a bit like writing a history of the 1960s while the Beatles are still singing. Nonetheless, Bergen’s book is the best one-volume treatment available on the current state of jihad in America.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/united-states-of-jihad-by-peter-bergen.html

2016-02-02,How to Foster an Elephant for Valentine’s Day,"The British artist and Wes Anderson collaborator Hugo Guinness has a soft spot for animals.

He was even the voice for the farmer Nathan Bunce in “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” And so it may come as no surprise that Guinness supports organizations that rescue innocent animals — like the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), protector and rehabilitator of orphaned elephants and rhinos in Africa. With J.Crew, he illustrated a sold-out sweatshirt, whose entire proceeds were donated to DSWT. He also created line drawings for the above animated video in support of DSWT’s Orphans’ Project, through which anyone may foster an infant for just $50 per year — a very nice Valentine’s Day present, if you ask us.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/t-magazine/foster-an-elephant-valentines-day-video-hugo-guinness.html

And from a mean cabin in upstate New York they formed a society that would draw thousands into communal villages across much of the United States. Lee did not live to survey her realm.

2016-02-03,"Bonnie Raitt, Lucinda Williams and Loretta Lynn Are Rocking On and On","The music industry may worship youth, but according to Bonnie Raitt, ‘‘in the fringe of the business, ageism isn’t as much of a thing.’’ Both Raitt, 66, who has a new record, ‘‘Dig in Deep,’’ out this month, and Lucinda Williams, 63, have remained prolific, to critical acclaim, since they rose to fame in the ’80s. That ‘‘shouldn’t be unusual,’’ says Williams, ‘‘but it is.’’ She fields a lot of questions about her continued success: ‘‘Basically, what they’re saying is, how come you haven’t fizzled out?’’ In fact, Williams feels like she’s in the prime of her career, a theory borne out by her 12th studio album, ‘‘The Ghosts of Highway 20,’’ also out this month, on which her famously ragged voice is rougher and more compelling than ever. A major influence on both Raitt and Williams is Loretta Lynn, who at 83 is releasing ‘‘Full Circle,’’ her first album since her 2004 collaboration with Jack White, in March. ‘‘As long as I’m on this earth,’’ she said recently, ‘‘I will try to be on top somewhere.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/t-magazine/entertainment/bonnie-raitt-lucinda-williams-loretta-lynn-new-albums.html

2016-02-04,"At Live Ideas Festival, a Twist on an Arab Dance and Scenes From Gaza","Every wedding has its communal dance. (In the United States, often, it’s the moves to “Y.M.C.A.”) In many Arab countries, it’s dabke, a twisting, weaving follow-the-leader line dance comprising small stomps, low kicks and clasped hands. It can be slow and contained, or rousing and athletic. That tradition anchors “Badke,” a work by the much-admired Belgian company Les Ballets C de la B that is part of the Live Ideas festival at New York Live Arts, focusing this year on the Middle East and North Africa. “Badke” developed over several years in workshops in the West Bank city of Ramallah and includes 10 Palestinian performers; the title’s scrambled letters suggest a familiar ritual with a twist (Thursday, Feb. 11, through Saturday, Feb. 13). On Tuesday and Wednesday, Arkadi Zaides, one of the few Israeli choreographers explicitly grappling with politics in his work, presents “Archive,” featuring film footage from Gaza. On Saturday, the creators of both shows sit down to discuss the role of art in a seemingly interminable conflict.

It’s a useful saying to keep in mind as, this week, the Japanese tech-art collective teamLab unveils its largest installation to date: 20 works inside 20,000 square feet. As the inaugural exhibition for Pace’s newly minted Art+Technology program, housed in the gallery’s Menlo Park space, it places tech-based art directly in the heart of Silicon Valley — to completely surprising effect. “We respect Silicon Valley exceedingly, but, as things are happening all the time, we aren’t paying it a lot of attention,” says Toshiyuki Inoko, the collective’s founder. “TeamLab wants to contribute to mankind through a different role than Silicon Valley.” The exhibition, titled “Living Digital Space and Future Parks,” aims to be a disruptor — and not in the tech-jargon sense, but rather more literally. “We want to think about a new way for art to be,” Inoko says. “Not just works of art, but including everything: space, viewers, even the market.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/t-magazine/art/teamlab-living-digital-space-future-parks-pace-gallery-california.html

2016-02-05,Review: ‘West of Eden’ — Hollywood Not-So-Confidential,"In 1971, Edie Sedgwick, the subject of Jean Stein’s last book, died in Santa Barbara of an overdose of alcohol and barbiturates. That same year, Jennifer Jones, one of the principal figures in Ms. Stein’s new “West of Eden,” staged a theatrical suicide attempt by walking into the ocean in Malibu, with good reason to expect she would be rescued. She was. She lived until 2009, surviving a troubled daughter, an even more unhinged son and two very rich husbands, David O. Selznick and Norton Simon. Even when running out of money, she insisted on spending $500 a month to have her sheets pressed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/books/review-west-of-eden-hollywood-not-so-confidential.html
2016-02-05,Review: Craig Finn and a Bleak Vision of America at the Appel Room,"“Certain songs, they get so scratched into our souls.” That line from “Certain Songs,” the opening number in Craig Finn’s American Songbook concert at the Appel Room on Wednesday evening, wonderfully describes how pop songs take hold of you without your even realizing it. Whenever you hear them, they transport you back in time (in this case to 1977 and the moment of Billy Joel’s “Only the Good Die Young” and Meat Loaf’s “Paradise by the Dashboard Light”).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/arts/music/review-craig-finn-and-a-bleak-vision-of-america-at-the-appel-room.html

2016-02-05,Review: ‘Hex’ Explores Shape-Shifting and Transference,"Can collaboration be seen as a feminist platform? The dance duo robbinschilds — formed in 2003 by Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs — is giving that idea a shot by branching out, choreographically speaking, to include six dancers in the creation of “Hex,” the pair’s latest work. It’s a female collective, but is it feminist? In the end, the fight against artistic hierarchy is more noble than effective. Topping the lengthy list of what “Hex” is missing is a point of view.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/arts/dance/review-hex-explores-shape-shifting-and-transference.html

2016-02-05,"Review: ‘Pride and Prejudice and Zombies’; More Tea, Dear?","As it turns out, fighting zombies does nothing to improve on the original Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen’s heroine from “Pride and Prejudice.” In “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” a character claiming to be Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), wields swords and other deadly blades, fires guns and occasionally flashes a leg in order to stomp on a zombie head. Battling the undead keeps her, friends and family safe from the flesh-eating hordes, but the character has been so radically transformed from Austen’s that Elizabeth already feels like a goner.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/movies/pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies-review.html

Unlike the protest art of an earlier era, much of the most interesting new work feels slippery and evasive, as if reluctant to speak its mind. In part, this is a reflection of different, though not necessarily evolved, thinking. We’ve abandoned old beliefs in utopias, in visions — some would say hallucinations — of a society built on absolute good for all, in which art plays a declaratively positive role. The 1960s counterculture, even at its most anarchic, was based on such beliefs and visions.

But the Target Margin Theater, known for radically reinventing classic behemoths, is not about to be daunted by a little excess weight. (Last year, it hoisted the dense literary conundrums of Gertrude Stein.) The company begins a two-season project devoted to O’Neill with a series of works that excavate and abstract the unwieldy “Electra” under the title “Drunken With What” at the Abrons Arts Center. As the name suggests, the lines between the muse and the bottle in O’Neill’s work will be considered, though in separate, cocktail-size gulps instead of a marathon binge. David Herskovits, Target Margin’s founder and artistic director, presides as spiritual bartender and mixologist.

2016-02-05,Inside the List,"The Cartoonist’s Elegy: Between romance novels and mysteries, love and death have long ruled the fiction lists. But they’re increasingly common in hardcover graphics as well: On this week’s list, nuanced considerations of family and mortality turn up in Adrian Tomine’s story collection “Killing and Dying” (No. 8 after 17 weeks); Tom Hart’s memoir “Rosalie Lightning,” about the death of his 1-year-old daughter (No. 6 after three weeks); and — the book that arguably paved the way in this regard — Roz Chast’s memoir of her parents’ deaths, “Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?” (No. 4 after 91 weeks). Chast’s memoir was chosen as one of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books in 2014, when we wrote that “cartoons, it turns out, are ­tailor-made for the absurdities of old age, illness and dementia.” But the book is equally moving as an account of Chast’s relationship with her parents — in particular her difficult, complicated mother. “I’ve been aware of issues with my mother since I was a little kid,” Chast told me recently via email. “The book didn’t really help me come to terms with them. There are certain things that don’t work out in life, and writing a book is an interesting way to look at those things and think about them. And I’m aware it could have been much, much worse. She had a lot of wonderful qualities: She was strong-willed and very smart. I’ve been told by her former students that she was the best teacher they ever had. But being a mom, which to me is a combination of strength but also flexibility — sometimes a lot of flexibility — was something that didn’t really interest her.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The dusty mounted heads — bison, caribou, moose — in her father’s trophy room haunt the story with their unsettling eyes. “Most stories bear as little relation to reality as Daddy’s trophies do to the warm and living animal,” Cissy’s mother warns her daughters — and the reader. “An animal looks back at you, but a trophy’s gaze never offers anything but a distorted and diminished reflection of your face.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/beasts-and-children-by-amy-parker.html

It showed a crowd of Chinese watching while one of their compatriots was beheaded by the Japanese, accused of being a Russian spy. “They were all strong fellows but appeared completely apathetic,” Zhou recalled. “After this film I felt that medical science was not so important after all. The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they may be, can only serve to be made examples of, or to witness such futile spectacles. . . . The most important thing, therefore, was to change their spirit, and since at that time I felt that literature was the best means to this end, I determined to promote a literary movement.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/the-big-red-book-of-modern-chinese-literature-edited-by-yunte-huang.html

One of the intellectuals, Laura ­Secor writes in “Children of Paradise,” an engrossing but narrowly focused history of the Iranian reform movement, was Abdolkarim Soroush, a champion of the ­Austrian-British philosopher of science and open-society advocate Karl Popper. Farsi translations of Popper’s works were flying off the shelves. But they were being savaged in the press by devotees of Soroush’s rival, Ahmad Fardid, who espoused the views of Martin Heidegger. Many hard-liners in the Islamic Republic were attracted to Heidegger, the midcentury German thinker tainted by his ties to Nazism, as a counter to Western scientific rationalism’s claims to universalism. “Because both philosophers were associated with the ruling regime, their debates were fully aired before the public,” Secor says. “Iranian intellectuals, perhaps thrilling to the aura of purpose, often describe the battle as a war by proxy between Heidegger and Popper.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/laura-secors-children-of-paradise-the-struggle-for-the-soul-of-iran.html

It’s the early 1980s, and Jed, a young man from Chicago with an addiction problem, is trying to flee his hometown’s suffocating racism and homophobia by expatriating himself to Berlin, a city he hopes will accept him and his desires as it did Isherwood’s a half-century earlier.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/darryl-pinckneys-black-deutschland.html

Mr. White, who had formative experience in the vanguard of African-American art music, brought the full spectrum of those interests to the table as a tunesmith, bandleader, producer and singer. His music was populist and positivist even as it arced toward a stratospheric level of harmonic and rhythmic sophistication.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/arts/music/maurice-white-a-voyager-who-traveled-countless-musical-paths.html

For the first collection in her new line, Eris, she collaborated with the renowned French perfumer Antoine Lie. Each perfume in La Belle et la Bête, which uses only synthetics for the animal notes, is ‘‘a collision between the animal and the floral.’’ Of the more provocative, funky notes, she says, ‘‘It’s not just shock value. It makes you rethink your sense of smell.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/t-magazine/fashion/eris-parfums-barbara-herman.html

2016-02-08,East Meets West in a One-of-a-Kind Cartier Pendant,"The jeweled panther may be the most recognizable symbol of Cartier, but the historic French house has always nurtured a subtler, more abstract side as well. Louis Cartier, who traveled to India and the Far East in the early 1900s, strove to combine the streamlined geometry of Art Deco with the lush motifs of Asia. Cartier’s chief designer (and Louis’s purported lover) Jeanne Toussaint often expressed that East-meets-West aesthetic in dangling necklaces made with unexpected stones; Cecil Beaton likened them to rosaries. This one-of-a-kind piece evokes those early masterworks. A gold chain adorned with black lacquer chevrons and diamonds cradles an Ethiopian white opal of nearly 16 carats, from which a rare green sapphire leads to the pendant’s decadent drop — a honeycomb of gold and jewels punctuated by a pear-shaped imperial topaz.

2016-02-09,"‘Forty Rooms,’ by Olga Grushin","The structure of Olga Grushin’s original new novel, “Forty Rooms,” is ingeniously simple. Over several decades, we follow the Russian-born narrator ­— an aspiring poet turned American housewife — into the 40 rooms that represent the topography of a privileged, middle-class woman’s life. We are taken from the “stuffy and bright” Moscow apartment bathroom — the first place to “emerge from the haze of nonbeing” when the protagonist is not yet 5 — to the suburban America entrance hall from which she will finally depart. And along the way, we come of age with the person whom we know, tellingly, only as Mrs. Caldwell. Or perhaps I should say, we come of ages with Mrs. Caldwell, because as any woman in her fifth decade or beyond can attest, most of us come of age in many stages: as daughter, as wife, as mother, as . . . you get the idea. It is a mark of the author’s skill that, while sweeping us along in Mrs. Caldwell’s particular narrative, Grushin indirectly challenges the reader to reflect on her own history; to come up with the labels that contribute to her own identity — writer, sister, for example — and to name the rooms in which she has come to her own realizations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/forty-rooms-by-olga-grushin.html

2016-02-10,An Exhibition That Proves Video Games Can Be Art,"In April 2010, a brouhaha erupted in the gaming community that still reverberates today: The film critic Roger Ebert had opined that video games could never truly be counted as art. “Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form,” he wrote on his blog. But three months later, in an erudite follow-up titled “Okay, Kids, Play on My Lawn,” he recanted. Great works of art, he speculated, “could instruct me about life, love, disease and death, principles and morality, humor and tragedy.” Ebert admitted that he hadn’t spent enough time with video games to know if they could, indeed, evoke these feelings. “I don’t know if they can be inspired to transcend themselves,” he wrote. “Perhaps they can.

2016-02-12,Inside the List,"Prophets of Doom: Some authors so thoroughly dominate their genre that rivals may want to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Act. Malcolm Gladwell, for instance, is the king of pithily titled, sociologically inflected narrative nonfiction with a vaguely entrepreneurial self-help feel; his “Outliers” has spent 208 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list and is currently No. 7 on the monthly business list. So it seems almost cheeky that the Wharton School professor Adam Grant has settled, for his latest addition to the field, on the pithy title “Originals.” Grant’s book, which debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list — and comes with a front-cover endorsement from Gladwell — overlaps with “Outliers” in substance as well as style: Both propose to explain why some people rise above their peers to change the world. (Gladwell emphasizes practice; Grant, passion and nonconformity.) Readers of the Book Review may be particularly interested in one study Grant cites, in which a psychologist gave subjects an actual New York Times book review, modified to make it either extremely positive or extremely negative, then asked them to rate the critic’s intelligence. “Which version makes the reviewer sound smarter?” Grant asks. “People rated the critical reviewer as 14 percent more intelligent, and having 16 percent greater literary expertise, than the complimentary reviewer. People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.” Or, as the original researcher put it, “Prophets of doom and gloom appear wise and insightful, while positive statements are seen as having a naïve ‘Pollyanna’ quality.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Nazi Reich is collapsing all around them, and they, like hundreds of thousands, are fleeing the wrathful Soviet advance. They are trapped between their German conquerors and their terrifying Russian “liberators.” Their story is told through the ­voices of Joana, a pretty Lithuanian nurse; Florian, a Prussian with a mysterious letter of passage from a high-ranking Nazi officer; and Emilia, an idealistic but damaged Polish girl in a pink knit cap. Thrown together, struggling to survive, they at first hardly trust one another enough even to exchange names, and so they often just use epithets: “the knight,” “the nurse,” “the Polish girl,” “the wandering boy,” “the shoe poet.” (The last, an old cobbler, gets his name from his philosophy: “The shoes always tell the story.”) Each has secrets — the galling histories that haunt anyone who has lived through war, flight and deprivation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/salt-to-the-sea-by-ruta-sepetys.html

The journey is the terror.” Forget the explicit reference to terror; a clammier sort of eeriness settles on the reader who pauses to research the identity of the epigraph’s supposed source, Elihu Hoopes, who turns out to be the “man without a shadow” of the title.

Readers of Faulks’s fiction, most notably of the loose trilogy formed by “Birdsong,” “The Girl at the Lion d’Or” and “Charlotte Gray,” know that his wartime plots tend to involve men and women finding and losing each other.

As with cats, their faces suggest they have no need of us, and in literature they have all the power that goes with independence. There are the foxes in Machiavelli’s “The Prince” (“One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps. . . . ”) and Jean de La Fontaine’s verses, and there’s Disney’s Robin Hood, matinee idol that he was. For me the most memorable literary fox until now has been the baby fox in Ted Hughes’s poem “Epiphany” — a distilled ball of “mannerless energy” and “old smell,” and a test of the poet’s ability to bend his life and marriage to fit the presence of something so wild and destructive, and so beautiful. Pax, the eponymous fox of Sara Pennypacker’s new novel, is built on the model of Hughes’s cub, half wild and half domesticated, a galvanic presence fit to join the ranks of fiction’s great foxes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/pax-by-sara-pennypacker.html

But still: damp shoes, damp clothes, the dank smell of river. The leak in the hall splitting the ceiling like the crust of a loaf.” The snowed-in feeling of Lucy Wood’s captivating debut novel, “Weathering,” comes from such descriptions of the house Ada has inherited upon her mother’s death, to which she has brought her young daughter, Pepper. This dampness so pervades the book that it almost swells the pages, and the imagery typifies Wood’s wonderful and energetic style, all the way down to the smallest detail: “She found a silty smudge, like a handprint, on the outside of the kitchen window and a small pile of stones on the front steps.” Lest you settle down too comfortably in this winter cabin of a novel: The handprint is that of her dead mother, Pearl.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/weathering-by-lucy-wood.html

The style was worn long, regardless of hair length — short-haired models were given extensions — and was shellacked in front with layers of Redken Triple Take Hairspray 32, sprayed at close range to create a hard “jewel-like” texture.

The second one, offered by Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern (who wrote one of the more generous liberal eulogies for Scalia), goes further and argues that Senate Republicans are gambling significantly by declining to approve a moderate-liberal nominee, since if they lose the Senate and the White House this fall they could end up with a more radical, precedent-overturning liberal on the court instead of a compromise choice.

The final result displayed their pieces amid a cozy living room and kitchenette — complete with fresh food. “As designers, we think in terms of a world,” Mansur says. “Although we’ve only been able to express shoes and bags, so far, we’re always thinking about the emotional aspect — and not product-driven — and that’s what we want to roll out.” Scroll over the images above and below to go inside the presentation.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/t-magazine/fashion/mansur-gavriel-new-york-fashion-week-fall-2016.html

But on Sunday afternoon, he traded the runway for an East Village furniture store, to celebrate a different kind of creative collaboration: “Prayer to Saint Thérèse” — an original audio work spoken by Chloë Sevigny, and turned into song. “I’ve been a fan of Chloë for a long time,” said Gaubert. Part of Régime des Fleurs’ Artefacts program, which pairs exquisite old objects with original artistic works, the song honors the patron saint of flowers — a fitting ode to the fragrance brand’s handmade perfumes, which are heavily inspired by art history.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/t-magazine/fashion/michel-gaubert-chloe-sevigny-playlist.html

2016-02-16,"‘West of Eden,’ by Jean Stein","Oral history looks all too easy. When the Belarussian writer Svetlana Alexievich won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature for her oral histories of humanitarian crises, it seemed an overdue confirmation of the genre’s literary nature — not just its capacity to tell sweeping, timeless human stories, but also the craft and cunning involved in its artful assemblage of specific, individual voices. In this country the form has proved to be both a serious vehicle for popular history and a reliable producer of best sellers, beginning with Studs Terkel’s “Working” in 1974. But it was Jean Stein’s 1982 book “Edie: American Girl,” edited with George Plimpton, that gave oral history the particular shimmer that comes when lofty literary aims happen to coincide with sheer entertainment value. “Edie” conjured the tragic life of Edith Sedgwick, who was born into a patrician New England family, grew up with seven siblings on isolated ­ranches near Santa Barbara under the yoke of a semi-deranged father, came east and after a stint in a mental hospital became Andy Warhol’s arm candy and a figure in New York counterculture, before being cast out by him and dying at 28 of an overdose. In many ways Stein’s new book, “West of Eden,” continues the larger project she began in “Edie”: chronicling a trickster promise embedded in our national consciousness — something shining and elusive and at its center not just ugly but quite often deadly.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/west-of-eden-by-jean-stein.html

Staring at his laptop in a cramped ground-floor office, he drank from his sixth cup of coffee and typed another in a long series of emails: ‘‘Try and cut them off rather than making for the last known position.’’ Nearly 9,000 miles away, the Remeliik, a police patrol ship from the tiny island nation Palau, was pursuing a 10-man Taiwanese pirate ship, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, through Palauan waters. Bergman, working for a nonprofit research organization called SkyTruth, had mastered the use of satellite data to chart a ship’s most likely course. Instead of pointing the police to where the pirate ship was, he would tell them where it was about to be. He took another sip of coffee, studied his screen, then typed again: ‘‘It may be advisable for the Remeliik to turn southeast.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/palau-vs-the-poachers.html

Gotcher was a labor activist, married to a leader of the Shirtwaist and Laundry Workers’ Union. The court found Muller guilty of violating Oregon law and fined him $10. He refused to pay, and on appeal to the Supreme Court, his lawyer drew national attention by making a feminist argument: Limits on women’s work hours actually discriminate against them. Two years earlier, in the well-known case Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court struck down a state law that restricted bakers, most of them men, to the same 10-hour day. The bakers were ‘‘in no sense wards of the state,’’ the court said. Why, Muller’s lawyer asked, should women be treated differently?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/do-women-need-legislative-protection.html

I wanted her to join me in marveling at this series of world-changing transformations, which I knew were beyond anything her girlhood self could have imagined.

I have one client whom I like very much and who has requested my services a number of times, but whenever I leave that client’s house, I find myself troubled. This family has a teacup pig, which lives with them in a medium-size apartment. I consider myself an animal lover, and it so happens that I have looked into the fad of teacup pigs. I know that they are really piglets of a larger variety, the potbellied pig, which are unintentionally underfed by owners who have been led by dishonest sellers to believe that the pigs need to eat less than they really do. Right now the pig is small, perhaps 10 to 15 pounds, but I know it will keep growing and that the lowest healthy weight for a full-grown ‘‘teacup pig’’ is about 60 pounds; a potbellied pig can easily grow to more than 100 pounds. I asked the family how big the pig would get, thinking perhaps they knew the facts and had some plan. They told me that they expect it to remain the size it is now. The worst part? They often remark that the pig is acting hungry; I imagine they feed him the too-small amount they were directed to by the seller. I believe that this family loves their pig very much and that I am witnessing an unintentional act of animal cruelty, but I am in a quandary: Should I tell them that they are unwittingly mistreating their beloved pet? I worry that I would be overstepping my professional bounds. People can be very touchy when it comes to their pets, and I want to maintain cordial relations with them for the sake of my continued employment.

And there are some that speak directly to their moment. “Over-Scheduled Andrew” is (you guessed it) firmly in the latter camp, taking aim at the current vogue for jam-packing children’s days with adult-run activities. This book represents the backlash against the frantic pursuit of what’s often known as “enrichment,” a term that can seem most apropos for the wallets of the adults who teach and coach all these after-school classes, teams and activities. Spires’s message is not subtle: She writes as an unapologetic champion of the idea that, rather than pushing elementary-schoolers into organized, goal-oriented pursuits, we would enrich their lives more by offering them, say, a couple of unstructured hours with a giant cardboard box, some scissors, packing tape and markers, and no grown-ups chirping directions at them.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/books/review/over-scheduled-andrew-by-ashley-spires.html

His original conception for the film — which ends the Nitehawk Cinema’s Little Bookworms series on Feb. 27 and 28 (Saturday and Sunday) — was too dark for Warner Bros., and the giant supporting characters, offspring of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, had animatronic issues. But the director persisted, and the movie, written by Mr. Jonze and Dave Eggers and offering gentle songs by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, became a classic of its own. The newcomer Max Records plays the hero, Max, but it’s the ensemble behind the beasts (including Forest Whitaker, Lauren Ambrose, Catherine O’Hara and Chris Cooper) who sparkle. As Max’s buddy Carol, James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano himself) had perhaps the most tender role of his career. Ages 6 and up.

Whether they’re standing in judgment doesn’t matter to William, whose arrogant faith in his own notion of Christianity is as deep and darkly unsettling as his sepulchral voice.

On the Outlaw Ocean, stowaways are cast overboard and left to die hundreds of miles from land. Workers are enslaved through debt or forced onto ships, sometimes for years. Hardly anyone is held accountable for the thousands of seafarers, fishermen and migrants who die every year because of unsafe vessels, territorial disputes and violence aboard ships. Murder is committed on camera, witnesses pose for selfies, footage is posted online, but no one investigates. Ships intentionally dump more oil and sludge into the ocean every three years than the Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez spills combined. Reporting this series over the past 20 months, I found that crimes at sea result not from an absence of law, but from a lack of enforcement.",Times Insider,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/insider/palau-gets-tough-on-sea-crime-reporters-notebook.html

For the last few years, Lahiri, whose first language is Bengali, has been reading and writing exclusively, if haltingly, in Italian out of fondness for the language, but also, she told NPR in an interview, “for another kind of need, I suppose — a more irrational, emotional need.” Although she allows she’s still wobbly — “I grope my way, like a child, like a semiliterate” — she’s found her way back to a purer pleasure in reading. “After I finish a book, I’m thrilled,” she writes in the memoir. “It seems like a feat.

Thirty years had passed since this seasoned film critic (then for New York, later The New Yorker) first experienced Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Shakespeare and the rest of the Western canon as an 18-year-old. At the time, that curriculum was at the heart of an impassioned culture war over whether the work of “dead white guys” — as some reformers derided them — remained relevant or appropriate for a multicultural generation of American college students.

But her tender friendship with Roosevelt, sustained over nearly a quarter-century and more than 300 cards and letters, helped.

Far from mastering “The Art of the Deal” — the title of his 1987 best seller — Trump made real estate blunders that turned billions in potential profits into mere millions. His foray into Atlantic City brought him perilously close to personal bankruptcy. As for all his claims about owning a sprawling business empire, what he actually runs these days is a licensing company that slaps the Trump name on everything from buildings to steaks to an education company that was sued by New York State in 2013 for “persistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct.” My conclusion — and I say this as a grizzled veteran of business journalism — was that Trump’s business acumen (not to mention his net worth) was wildly overstated, not least by Trump himself.

2016-02-22,"Sunny’s Bar, a Spiritual Holdout in Red Hook","Tim Sultan first came upon Sunny’s, a waterfront saloon in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in 1995. By then, the legion of working-class bars that once populated that small peninsula had dwindled to one. The holdout was presided over by Antonio Balzano, known as Sunny. A painter and actor, he was a reluctant heir to the family business — so much so that he only bothered to open one quiet night a week. This unintentionally shrewd move made going to Sunny’s a notable occasion, and the bar was soon drawing crowds. Today, Red Hook is gentrified, and Sunny’s is open six nights a week. Sunny, now 81, has largely withdrawn from its day-to-day operations, but his bar remains the neighborhood’s spiritual outpost.

2016-02-22,The Case for Rubio-Kasich,"Saturday’s Republican primary in South Carolina was not quite the train wreck for the not-Trump portion of the party that seemed likely after New Hampshire’s multi-candidate pileup.

That consolidation meant that notwithstanding Donald Trump’s victory, it wasn’t nearly as good a night for him as New Hampshire: The field narrowed, the party’s leadership accelerated its rally around Rubio, and the emerging three-way battle between Trump, Rubio and Ted Cruz, while still better for the Donald than a two-man race, isn’t the pure gift to him that the old Christie-Jeb-Rubio-Kasich combination offered.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/the-case-for-rubio-kasich/

One example he cited is his amatriciana, which uses lardo in place of guanciale and spaghetti alla chitarra instead of bucatini. Also on the menu are a fennel salad with olives and provolone, mushroom and onion fritto misto with lemon; and grilled swordfish with artichokes, raisins and almonds.

But Gerbase is no gimmick: She grew up fascinated by Savile Row’s legacy and the way men build their wardrobes, and spent the first six years of her career designing bespoke men’s suiting. At John Lobb, she’s brought a keen eye to the house’s archives. The lightweight, unlined suede shoes in her new spring collection reject the idea that English-made footwear must be hefty — but retain classic codes like buckles, hidden stitching and overlaid saddles.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/t-magazine/fashion/british-shoemaker-paula-gerbase-john-lobb.html
2016-02-24,Looking On the Bright Side of Trump,"No, folks, I’m not retracting any of my “it won’t be Trump” predictions just yet, but in the interest of staying au courant with my fellow pundits in the wake of last night’s Nevada steamrolling let’s stroll for a moment in a world where Donald Trump actually wins the nomination. Michael Brendan Dougherty has a good column on all the ways that this would be a disaster for the conservative movement — how it would weaken the influence of conservatism’s major institutions (by exposing how “inessential” their ideas and imprimatur are to actually winning power in the G.O.P.), how it would turn the right’s personnel and policy minds against one another (some would throw in with Team Trump, others wouldn’t, and the recriminations would be vicious), and how it would create a particular crisis for the pro-life movement, because Trump’s “conversion on the issue is far less convincing than those of previous nominees like Mitt Romney or George H.W. Bush,” and one way or another his nomination would probably guarantee that genuinely anti-Roe justices would be “reduced to a tiny rump on a consolidated, progressive Supreme Court.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/looking-on-the-bright-side-of-trump/

Hiring managers, he thought, were too often swayed by the name of a fancy college on a résumé. To try to address the problem, he created a software company called GapJumpers, working with employers to create challenges for applicants that mimicked what people would do on the job. Companies using GapJumpers wouldn’t see candidates’ résumés, just their names, photographs and test results. In theory, this process would shift employers’ focus from résumés to skills. Then, two years ago, he came across an idea that caused him to rethink his business.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/is-blind-hiring-the-best-hiring.html

It’s meant to address the accelerated construction of museum buildings and prisons in the United States since the 1970s, parallel trends of cultural expression and incarceration. Running from February 26- March 13, it’s the first installment in “Open Plan,” a series of five short shows, each of which will occupy the whole of the museum’s 18,200-square-foot gallery, the largest unobstructed museum exhibition space in New York.

The program he presents for his solo recital at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, March 3, is a riddle of sorts, too, a musical palindrome. After opening with one Bach Partita (No. 6), it moves on to early Schumann, pauses on the Impressionist-Symbolist reverie of Szymanowski’s “Metopes,” then reverses its steps through late Schumann and back to Bach (Partita No. 1). “Metopes,” based on three Classical friezes depicting stages of Homer’s “The Odyssey,” are lovely works that are too rarely played and that seem to look both forward and backward. The first is inspired by Odysseus’s encounter with the Sirens. It will be haunting to hear it followed by Schumann’s “Ghost Variations,” the last work he wrote before being confined to a mental institution; according to experts, Schumann tried to drown himself in the Rhine between the composition of the fourth and fifth variations.

The finest satire in Judd Apatow’s new Netflix show, “Love,” takes place on the studio lot of a tween-courting television series about witches with the spectacularly awful title “Wichita.” And there’s a new Broadway revival of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible,” the most famous play about the anxiety of witchcraft this side of “Macbeth.” The last time this was on Broadway, in 2002, Richard Eyre directed a worthy production starring Laura Linney and Liam Neeson. Expect something more adventurous from the director Ivo van Hove, who staged the stripped-down revival of Mr. Miller’s “A View from the Bridge.” He has an equally impressive roster to work with, including Saoirse Ronan, Ben Whishaw and Ciaran Hinds.

Now in his late 40s, he has worked with some of the great traditional flamenco singers of the last several decades — Camarón de la Isla, Enrique Morente, Diego el Cigala and Carmen Linares — but has also been part of the genre’s modernizing wave: He encompasses the tradition while trying other languages and techniques. (His last album, “Tierra,” combined flamenco with Celtic music.) He’s played in New York before, but his appearance this week, at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium, is part of his first major United States tour. It won’t be Celtic or any other kind of fusion: He’s bringing a traditional ensemble, as well as the dancer Antonio Molina, known as El Choro.

The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the measure in a 10-to-9 bipartisan vote. Florida’s extremely porous geology raised fears among environmentalists and Florida residents that well stimulation could more easily lead to contamination of underground aquifers, the source of drinking water for almost all Floridians. The bill, which had passed the House, proposed regulating only two forms of well stimulation in the state but left out a third method, matrix acidizing, that is conducted with low pressure. It also would not require oil and gas companies to reveal all of the chemicals they would put into the ground because some are protected by federal law. The legislation called for a study on the potential effect of well stimulation, but matrix acidizing would not be part of the study. Local governments objected to the legislation because it would prohibit them from banning well stimulation. Nearly 80 counties and cities have passed resolutions or ordinances that banned or opposed fracking. The bill can be called up again in the Senate committee. Well stimulation is not regulated in Florida and does not require a separate permit. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/florida-bill-to-regulate-fracking-fails-to-advance.html

2016-02-26,Should Democrats Fear Trump?,"My insta-take on last night’s debate isn’t particularly original: Marco Rubio’s shrinking violet act this week turned out to be a head fake, he battered and — above all — mocked Donald Trump in ways that Republicans should have been battering him and mocking him all along, and Trump’s counterpunches were weak and Rubio did what poor Jeb Bush never managed and talked over him, denying him the chance to let his punchlines land. Between Rubio and Ted Cruz, who was also on offense, there was still probably too much talk about how Trump is not a real conservative, and too little in the way of efforts to actually co-opt the valid parts of Trump’s critiques of organized conservatism and the Republican Party. And if Trump somehow wins that will be the deep story — that his rivals just couldn’t grasp how disaffected their voters were from the Bush-and-after record and the present party line. But what we saw last night was at least, and at last, the obvious way of taking down Trump, the way that I’ve assumed will work all along.

Abolition established the principles and rhetoric, while setting the strategies and tactics, that have guided all subsequent reform movements — even those that have stood opposed to one another like prohibitionism and antiprohibitionism, or pro- and anti-abortion rights. Recently, historians have been taking a new look at the struggle against slavery as a way of examining contemporary movements for securing human rights, expanding democracy, liberating colonials and criticizing capitalism.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/books/review/the-slaves-cause-a-history-of-abolition-by-manisha-sinha.html

2016-02-26,Inside the List,"O Captain: William Shatner’s new book, “Leonard,” about his 50-year relationship with his “Star Trek” co-star and occasional frenemy Leonard Nimoy, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 11. Readers looking for gossip about Kirk and Spock won’t be disappointed — there’s plenty here about contract disputes, on-set rivalries and substance abuse, along with the revelation that Nimoy, who died in 2015 at the age of 83, essentially stopped speaking to Shatner for the last several years of his life because Shatner had filmed him without permission for a documentary about the Starship Enterprise. But Shatner also devotes generous space to his friend’s sensitive artistic side, taking note of Nimoy’s photographic pursuits and seven volumes of poetry — including, in 1973, the surprisingly successful debut “You & I,” which went through five print runs in hardcover and had an initial paperback printing of 250,000 copies. “What helped sell the book, of course, was the fact that Leonard was willing to promote it by doing bookstore signings,” Shatner writes. “It may have been Leonard’s poetry — but fans were getting Spock’s autograph.” What did Shatner think of the work? “Trying to understand poets through their poetry requires higher degrees than I have,” he writes, “but it is obvious reading his work that from the beginning to the end Leonard was intent on emotionally defining grand themes like love, compassion, loss and the endless search for roots. For the man who became famous playing the ultimate dispassionate character, his poems successfully bring out the range of important emotions.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

She resents the fact that a nun of the Dominican order, singing a tribute to the order’s founder, St. Dominic, did so with a “mind-numbing refrain that still pounds in my cortex as ‘Dominiqua-niqua-niqua.’ ” She writes to prove that the so-called religious experience of conversion often has a secular explanation — then she offers a broad range to choose from.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/books/review/strange-gods-by-susan-jacoby.html

The caesura, or poetic line break, becomes a literal break, geologic in form, rising from the piece like a mountain range from a fault line. “It’s linguistic,” says Larner, who this week presents nearly 30 of these wall-hung sculptures as a body of work at the Aspen Art Museum, “but it’s also physical.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/t-magazine/art/liz-larner-sculpture-aspen-art-museum.html

With the touch of a button, the divinely complex mechanism would chime a mellifluous pattern counting off the hour, and then, in increments of five, the minutes. Baume & Mercier’s new Clifton 1830 pocket watch is an updated version of that marvel, showcasing the five-minute repeater, a ‘‘complication’’ long vaunted by aficionados. The Swiss house has made just 30, set in 18-karat red gold.
