There exists no universal system for the successful impartation of certain values to children, because each child is a kind of hydra: Both adversaries wear down your tools and multiply the problems you think you’ve solved. The only method is improvisation to the point of exhaustion. You try things, those things generally fail, the kid somehow survives, you try slightly different things, ad infinitum, ad absurdum, until the kid finally outlasts the experiment that is your care. This, after too many after-school ‘‘talks’’ that turned into terrible lectures, is what drove me to the fables of Aesop this past spring.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/letter-of-recommendationaesops-fables.html

A superstar of the Christian Tea Party right, Cruz was traveling the country preaching a gospel of border control, gun rights, the tyranny of the federal government and — with special passion — the growing crisis of gay marriage. Page was one of the most famous young gay people in the world — an Oscar-nominated actress who, after building her career in the closet, came out, very publicly, in an emotional speech on Valentine’s Day 2014. (It has been viewed more than five million times on YouTube.) Now Page and Cruz stood on opposite sides of a giant grill, in the midst of many camera crews, inhaling particulate pork.

2015-10-01,How Ned Yost Made the Kansas City Royals Unstoppable,"The game in Detroit was tied in the bottom of the ninth, and Ned Yost needed a relief pitcher. As the manager of the Kansas City Royals, he had a formidable bullpen at his disposal. Kelvin Herrera, who throws 99 m.p.h., had already pitched the seventh inning, his usual assignment. He struck out all three batters he faced. Wade Davis, the master of a near-unhittable cut fastball, had done his job by pitching a scoreless eighth. That left Greg Holland, who has saved 116 games for the Royals over the past three seasons. Holland’s responsibility, as Yost saw it, was to finish games — but only when protecting a lead. Yost said repeatedly that he wouldn’t use Holland when his team is behind or tied. ‘‘Don’t look for me to do it,’’ he told the beat writers after one game last year. ‘‘I’m not going to do it.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/magazine/how-ned-yost-made-the-kansas-city-royals-unstoppable.html

Losing her early New York friend and roommate, Robert Mapplethorpe, to AIDS in 1989. Her book is about moving from a time when her children were little and “the things I touched were living” (“my husband’s fingers, a dandelion, a skinned knee”) to a time when she increasingly began to capture and memorialize moments from her life in photos and words — to create, as an artist, talismanic souvenirs of the past.

The Hemingways were fresh off a luxury steamship from Oak Park, Ill., looking to chuck the suburban grind for the seasonal joys of lake country. For $400 they soon had a 20- by 40-foot clapboard cottage built that was short on nearly every amenity except peace and quiet. It wasn’t pioneer life — they had brought along a maid — but the surrounding woods were populated by Ojibwe Indians, black bears, lumberjacks and bootleggers.

But for most of his career, he was a facile imitator, bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic, spending a total of nearly 20 years sojourning, at different times, in Madrid and in Paris, where he studied with Courbet and hung out with Impressionist painters like Pissarro, Monet and Cézanne.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/arts/design/francisco-oller-core-of-impressionism-and-the-caribbean-at-the-brooklyn-museum.html

2015-10-02,Photos That Highlight the Playfulness of a Religious Holiday,"The photographer Estelle Hanania has long been interested in depicting ritual: her past projects have included “Parking Lot Hydra,” a series portraying a traditional Bulgarian masquerade aimed at banishing evil spirits, and “Glacial Jubilé,” an anthropological view of wintertime folk traditions throughout Europe. In her new book, “Happy Purim” (Shelter Press), the masks and costumes associated with the Jewish holiday serve to universalize Hanania’s subjects, emphasizing the universality of dressing up rather than the particularity of religious culture. To that end, Hanania visits and documents places that seem as though they could be anywhere — not just the London neighborhood of Stamford Hill where the photos were taken. Uninterested in establishing a specific location, the artist situates children dressed as kings, as elderly people and even as pizzas against generic backgrounds: brick walls, sidewalk blocks. These pictures put a surreal spin on family photographs, teasing out the contrasts between youth and adulthood, childhood and mortality, appearing and disappearing.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/t-magazine/estelle-hanania-photos-book-happy-purim.html

About 50,000 children had been registered, and the board had stopped accepting new names.

2015-10-02,Inside the List,"The Best Medicine: Jenny Lawson’s second memoir, “Furiously Happy,” is subtitled “A Funny Book About Horrible Things,” and she’s not kidding. The book, which enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 3, is all about Lawson’s struggles with various forms of mental illness — clinical depression, panic attacks, a compulsion to pull out her own hair — and as unlikely as it might sound to anybody who hasn’t visited Lawson’s blog (or read her 2012 debut, “Let’s Pretend This Never Happened”), it’s also very, very entertaining. Here she is, for instance, discussing the fact that her first antidepressant led her to fixate on suicide, “which is sort of the opposite of what you want”: “Lots of concerned friends and family felt that the first medication’s failure was a clear sign that drugs were not the answer; if they were I would have been fixed. Clearly I wasn’t as sick as I said I was if the medication didn’t work for me. And that sort of makes sense, because when you have cancer the doctor gives you the best medicine, and if it doesn’t shrink the tumor immediately then that’s a pretty clear sign you were just faking it for attention.” Ouch. Later, she complains that “there is nothing more annoying than having someone tell you that everything would be fine if you were just a better pray-er,” and adds, “I can tell you that ‘Just cheer up’ is almost universally looked at as the most unhelpful depression cure ever. It’s pretty much the equivalent of telling someone who just had their legs amputated to ‘just walk it off.’ ” Lawson is obviously no fan of well-meaning platitudes, but her book at least proves the one about looking back on all of this and laughing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-10-02,"‘The Gay Revolution,’ by Lillian Faderman","Lillian Faderman’s “The Gay Revolution: The Story of the Struggle” opens with two vignettes. The first is of Prof. E.K. Johnston of the University of Missouri, prosecuted for sodomy in 1948. The respected 50-year-old “lost his job, his good name, his beloved students, his entire career — even his pension.” The second depicts a ceremony for Army Col. Tammy Smith’s elevation to the rank of general in 2012. According to tradition, the stars on a new general’s epaulets are affixed by the two individuals most meaningful to her — in Smith’s case, her father and her wife. ­Faderman then asks one of the framing questions of her important book: “What long-fought battles, tragic losses and hard-won triumphs have brought us as a country from the days when a much loved and gifted professor could be disgraced, thrown in jail and hounded out of his profession as soon as his private life was revealed, to the days when a military officer could marry the woman she loves in broad daylight and be promoted, in a very public ceremony, to the rank of general with her wife by her side?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/the-gay-revolution-by-lillian-faderman.html

Sienna Miller plays Taya, the wife left behind as Mr. Kyle returns to the war zone time after time. “The politics of the Iraq war are entirely absent, which is a political statement in its own right,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Clint Eastwood’s controversial adaptation of Mr. Kyle’s memoir. “And though George W. Bush’s name is never invoked, ‘American Sniper’ can be seen as an expression of nostalgia for his Manichaean approach to foreign policy. It can equally — and this may amount to the same thing — be seen as upholding the Hollywood western tradition of turning complicated historical events and characters into fables and heroes.” In other words, he added, “it’s only a movie.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-10-05,What’s on TV Monday,"8 P.M. (Encore) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Fly fishing surged in popularity after Robert Redford’s visually stunning tale about a minister’s sons coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Depression — and finding expression for their emotions knee-deep in a rushing river. Craig Sheffer plays the introspective Norman Maclean, on whose 1976 autobiographical story this film is based; Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother. “Between the novella’s well-known first sentence (‘In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing’) and its elegiac last line (‘I am haunted by waters’), ‘A River Runs Through It’ circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Maclean’s early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. It is easy to recognize Mr. Redford’s “reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love,” she added. “The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean — of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace — are ably reflected on the screen.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

Her four-night run at BAM has already sold out, as did previous engagements in London, Boston and elsewhere; her upcoming shows in Los Angeles will no doubt follow suit, if they haven’t already by the time this article is published. “I think it’s sort of a theoretical idea: People love to say, ‘She’s a performance artist,’ which isn’t even really the right phrase at this point,” July says, noting that the small theaters she favors necessarily trade exposure for intimacy. But though they may be limited affairs, her shows, however one chooses to categorize them, remain a significant part of her oeuvre. “I just keep chugging along, because I like doing it,” she says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/t-magazine/10-things-that-inspire-miranda-july.html

All of these pieces, in different ways, evoke images and people through music. The program opens with David Lang’s rhythmically hypnotic “cage,” a tribute to John Cage, and ends with Mr. Lang’s ruminative “wed” (from “Memory Pieces”). There is also a mysterious, alluring work by Toru Takemitsu; Mr. Tao’s dreamy “A Walk (for Emilio),” a portrait of Emilio del Rosario, Mr. Tao’s first significant teacher; and Elliott Carter’s “Two Thoughts About the Piano,” a pair of breathlessly skittish, complex pieces, played dazzlingly by Mr. Tao, especially the perpetual- motion “Caténaires.” Though his account of “Pictures at an Exhibition” is sometimes a little percussive for my taste, he plays it with enormous imagination, color and command.

The stated purpose of the trip was a bachelor party for an old friend, but we needed little excuse to follow our home team on the road. When we checked into our hotel, we realized just how closely we had followed them; the Dodgers were staying there, too. This was a little like running into your calculus teacher at the mall. These people aren’t supposed to exist in real life. Excited, we filled out bingo cards with player sightings.

2015-10-08,Shooting a Lion,"I’m sitting with eight other tourists in an open-topped Land Cruiser driving on dirt roads in the Sabi Sand, a group of private game reserves on the southwest border of South Africa’s two-million-hectare Kruger National Park. It’s a landscape of splintered trees and pale acacia thorns, drifts of sand glittering brightly with quartz, and it is full of wildlife: We’ve seen leopards and hyenas, muddy groups of wart hogs, innumerable birds and antelopes. After years of watching wildlife documentaries, spotting animals from the vehicle is a thrilling but disconcertingly familiar experience. Not only do they exactly resemble the ones on TV, but when Jonathan Vogel, the game ranger at the wheel, starts to talk about the animals, his expert tone makes me think of voice-over narration. While I’ve never been on safari before, and though I traveled here to watch animals, I’m spending a lot of time trying to make what is happening seem real.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/magazine/shooting-a-lion.html

As hot-blooded as any 17-year-old gangly, anxious, bookish virgin can be, Edoardo suffers from phimosis, a condition in which his foreskin is so tight that it cannot pull back over the head of his penis. Arousal is actually painful. While his friend Arturo can spend the summer chasing girls quite willing to take their libidos out for a test drive, Edoardo dare not. Yet his sensitive nature attracts the girl across the street; a new, more experienced flame; and even a kindhearted prostitute.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/movies/review-short-skin-an-anatomical-sex-comedy.html

Jerry Brown on Thursday signed a variety of environmental bills, including a measure that requires the public employee pension funds to drop investments in coal.

2015-10-09,What’s On Television Friday,"8:45 A.M. (HBO Signature) POLLOCK (2000) Ed Harris summons the spirit of the Abstract Expressionist giant Jackson Pollock, standing over an enormous canvas and dripping paint in graceful swooping gestures as the camera dances around him. He also seethes like the surly, violent alcoholic that Pollock was — upending dinner tables; raging at his wife, the painter Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden); and ultimately crashing his car with two female companions in what might have been a deliberate suicide run. Yes, the movie, which Mr. Harris also directed, “has flaws and inaccuracies,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “But ‘Pollock’ is for the most part admirable. It reminds us that great art isn’t about creating beauty out of misty-eyed Hallmark moments but about discovering and communicating messy truths that spill all over the place, just like the lives of the artists driven to uncover them.” (Image: Mr. Harris)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/arts/television/whats-on-television-friday.html

Gawande, a surgeon and a staff writer at The New Yorker, told me via email that the book’s success had caught him by surprise, considering society’s usual reluctance to talk about the end of life. “This is not an easy book,” he said. “By Chapter 2, you’re reading about your teeth falling out, your brain shrinking, your eyes dimming. In every case — spoiler alert — the person dies. And I was late with the book. I was supposed to finish it in time for release in spring. Instead, it came out in the holiday season. I was proud of it. But I felt for my publisher. Who was going to buy a death book for the holidays? And then people did.

Marie Mesnin, who worked for a dressmaker on the first floor, had dropped a needle on to the glass marquise over the terrace of the café. Whilst attempting to pick up the fallen implement of her trade she had stepped upon a pane of glass, which gave way beneath her avoir-dupois. Happily for her, but not for him, M. Bonvallet was seated just beneath. Mlle. Mesnin was more frightened than hurt by her fall, while M.

But now, just in time for the bicentennial of Trollope’s birth, there is a new, restored version of his 1880 novel “The Duke’s Children,” assembled by a team of researchers led by Steven Amarnick, who went back to the original manuscript in Yale’s Beinecke Library, and it really is better, even if for the time being it’s only available in a deluxe Folio Society edition — the kind of book, slipcased, gilded, finely bound, that’s so grand you’re a little embarrassed to be seen with it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/books/review/trollope-uncut.html

The wood might become ill and die, or the fairies might skip the wood altogether and leave a fairy-baby instead, carting the little human off for other purposes. Either way, there’s a particular kind of terror inherent in the situation: to look in a crib expecting to see one’s cooing infant and instead find something inert and unknown. Maurice Sendak’s picture book “Outside Over There” captures the horror with a rich gorgeousness, where the replacement baby is made of ice, and glows milky and terrifying and odd on the page.

Although Mr. Buceta, 52, lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with his wife, Lynne Bilenkey, 48, who heads up online sales for Victoria’s Secret, he chose to open Singlecut in Queens because the borough is home to him. His parents arrived there from Argentina in 1963; he was born at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center; and he graduated from Queens College. In fact, weekends are distinctive for Mr. Buceta because he does not spend them in Queens.

In the fiscal years of 1962, 1963 and 1964, about 16,200 foreign scientists settled in the United States. Opponents of the new immigration law argue that the United States is becoming a repository for second-class aliens and that liberalization of the old law makes matters worse.

It’s about one hundred years since fashion took its place alongside literature, painting and music as a way to look for the social essence of one’s era. Proust saw it happening, and, in ‘‘In Search of Lost Time,’’ Madame de Guermantes’s dresses are ‘‘not a casual decoration alterable at will, but a given, poetical reality like that of the weather, or the light peculiar to a certain hour of the day.’’ I tried to recall the passage as I waited for Karl Lagerfeld in his Paris apartment off the Boulevard St. Germain. It was just after 1 p.m., though there is something timeless about the room where he likes to take his lunch. It has blinds and something of an Art Deco ambiance in shades of gray, angular, with spotless glass and candle-scented air, a Jeff Koons sculpture erupting on the table, next to a beautiful drawing for the poster of the 1924 film ‘‘L’Inhumaine.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/t-magazine/karl-lagerfeld-interview.html

One spoke of the gotta-dance New Jersey child who arrived at the New York ballet school of Bronislava Nijinska’s student Nina Youskevitch (1920-98). Another recalled how, in the 1990s, Ms. Somogyi stood out amid the corps de ballet. (“Even when she was standing still, you would see how the movement always kept flowing through her arms.”) Others recalled the roles she has created: two for Jerome Robbins, no fewer than six for Peter Martins, one in Christopher Wheeldon’s “Polyphonia,” and more.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/arts/dance/review-jennie-somogyi-stirs-memories-in-her-city-ballet-goodbye.html

While no casualties were reported, the episode took place two months after explosions at a chemical storage depot in another part of the city killed at least 165 people. In a scene reminiscent of that blast on Aug. 12, social media sites in China showed videos of a large fireball lighting up the sky in Tianjin. Firefighters received an alarm at 9:46 p.m. on Monday, responding to a fire in a warehouse storing ammonia and alcohol, the Beijing News reported. The fire was under control by midnight, the newspaper reported, citing a local government announcement. A witness told the newspaper that there had not been a blast, though several other accounts in the Chinese news media described the fire as an explosion. The August explosions at a warehouse that stored hazardous chemicals leveled part of Tianjin’s port district and exposed a system of lax enforcement of safety rules and political cronyism that has accompanied China’s rapid industrialization. Monday’s fire  occurred in the Beichen district, an area far closer to the urban core of Tianjin.

But this story, set in the Germany of medieval romance, is complicated by aspects of pathos, wildness, doom, tragedy, malice — all of which Tchaikovsky’s score responds to passionately. By breaking Odette’s heart, Siegfried condemns her to an eternity of turning back into swan form by day and only regaining human form, with her female companions, at night.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/arts/dance/swan-lake-discoveries-allow-for-a-deeper-dive-into-its-history.html

While the article laid out the history of the Jewish temples and the archaeological and historical evidence about them, the headline and a passage in the initial version of the article implied incorrectly that questions among scholars about the location of the temples potentially affected Jewish claims to the site and Israel’s broader assertion of sovereignty over Jerusalem. In fact, as the article was later corrected to clarify, the scholarly debate is a narrower one, focused on the precise location on the Temple Mount where the long destroyed temples once stood. All versions of the article should have made clear that the archaeological and historical uncertainties about the site — unlike assertions by some Palestinians that the temples never existed — do not directly challenge Jewish claims to the Temple Mount.",Corrections,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/pageoneplus/editors-note-october-14-2015.html

The photograph of the forest was near the entrance of the exhibition, and I had walked past it without stopping because it seemed to be simply another big photo, of which there are so many in museums these days. But after going through the exhibition, I decided to double back. This time around, I took a good look at the large photograph, which was more than 16 feet wide, and found that there was more to it than size. The leaves were odd, simplified. I read the caption. What the photograph (titled ‘‘Clearing’’) showed was not a forest, but a model of a forest. The German artist Thomas Demand had constructed this model from paper and set it in a steel frame 50 feet wide. Two hundred and seventy thousand leaves had been individually cut.

This new disc focuses on Mr. Holliger’s project of “transcriptions” (2001-09) of pieces by the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut. Machaut’s ballade “Biaute qui toutes autres pere” is translated from a cappella voices into airy, sun-shard harmonics for three violas; in Mr. Holliger’s version of another ballade, the original melody glints behind veils of new dissonances. Machaut’s “Hoquetus David” becomes Mr. Holliger’s sliding, plucking, tapping, ultimately chaotic “nach Hoquetus David,” and the new arrangement of Machaut’s seventh lay adds three new, duskily harmonizing vocal lines to the single surviving one. The cycle is capped with two extensive summations; the final “Complainte” brings together voices and violas in a melancholy outpouring. The transcriptions project has Mr. Holliger’s customary, total elegance, as well as a tenderness that reaches, composer to composer, across centuries. The performers are attentive and passionate, and the recorded sound vivid enough to capture the violists’ intakes of breath as they cue each other.

Despite its being more of a hobby among work buddies, I was instantly hooked — on the office camaraderie, on the knowledge and skill needed to build a roster and set weekly lineups, on the Vegas-level thrill of having “action” on every game. I might even win a few bucks at the end of the season.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/opinion/the-fantasy-sports-non-scandal.html

2015-10-16,Trippy Photo Collages — With a Dash of the Surreal,"The photographer Eric T. White has always been drawn to color and playfulness — which now he’s taken one step further with his recent collage and cutout series. The New York-based artist began collaging early in his career, while assisting other photographers and traveling around the world for shoots. “I had all these great snapshots that I didn’t really have a place for,” he says — a problem he solved by experimenting with new and unexpected ways to combine those extra prints. White’s shooting style and photography process are simple and low-fi, but his Dadaist and Surrealist influences add layers of complexity and tone as he continually forces himself to push the limits of his chosen medium. With equal parts childlike randomness and methodical precision, White’s collages represent not only a throwback to the cut-and-paste methods necessitated by analog photography, but also how modern a DIY technique can feel.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/t-magazine/trippy-photo-collages-eric-t-white.html

Born in 1958, Mr. Tjapaltjarri is a Pintupi artist and ritual healer from the Western Australia desert.

Perhaps this represents a turn away from the “zombie formalism” micromovement — a pejorative term for the sort of gimmicky abstract products that have lately been pumped out by younger artists to satisfy the market’s taste. Or maybe it’s simply a shifted course, in service of expanding demand in another direction. Whether the cause is more commercial or more creative, one could speculate the change is indicative of global shifts that are afoot beyond the bubble of the art world. Three pieces in particular include strikingly spare, concise bodies drawn in gestural outlines: Camille Henrot’s light, raunchy jokes at the Parisian gallery Kamel Mennour; Jesse Wine’s forensic traces of discarded clothing painted on ceramic tile at London’s Limoncello; and at the New York gallery 47 Canal, Trevor Shimizu’s cartoonishly contented lady with child, a work whose emotional depth somehow transcends that of an emoji.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/t-magazine/frieze-art-fair-trends-london.html

Maybe the makers of the new feature film based on the books by R. L. Stine were thinking along the same lines, because “Goosebumps” the movie takes quite literally the notion of the power of fiction to come alive.

2015-10-16,Kia Plans Recall of Sorentos in Light of a Roll-Away Risk,"Kia is recalling 377,000 of its 2011-13 Sorentos, saying the vehicle can roll away unexpectedly because the transmission can be moved out of park without applying the brakes, according to documents the carmaker posted Thursday on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Kia said it had received numerous complaints about the problem, including reports of three injuries. The carmaker said it was caused by drivers who use “excessive force” to move the gearshift lever, thus damaging the gearshift interlock mechanism. That interlock, mandated by the government, requires the driver to depress the brake before the transmission can be moved out of park. An Ohio man told regulators that his Sorento rolled down his driveway when his 10-year-old son was playing unsupervised in the vehicle. In the complaint, posted in 2014 on the safety regulator’s website, the man said his son “jumped out of the truck and tried to stop it by getting behind it.” The child was hospitalized for almost three weeks with injuries including four cracked ribs and a cracked pelvis.

One of the few acts at Appomattox that moves so many white Southerners to emotion was the generosity of permitting Gen. Robert E. Lee and his officers to depart with their side arms. It was technically a gallant gesture but arguably Grant’s unconscious acknowledgment of what we now know: that the war didn’t end but would merely be engaged on other battlefields: Klan terrorism, Jim Crow, redlining, housing covenants, voting ­rights restrictions.

2015-10-16,Inside the List,"What Would Jim Do? After making its debut last week atop the hardcover fiction list, “The Murder House,” by James Patterson and David Ellis, slips to No. 3. This is the fourth collaboration between Patterson and Ellis, and the second, after last year’s “Invisible,” to hit No. 1. Patterson’s co-writers don’t often discuss their professional relationship, but in 2012 Ellis reflected on the lessons he’d learned from “Guilty Wives,” their first team effort. “I always felt like Jim was doing more than collaborating with me on a novel,” Ellis wrote on his website. “He was trying to teach me, too. And it was always about the reader. It’s not about winning writing awards (though he has won plenty). It’s not about how impressively you display all the research you’ve amassed. It’s not about the number of syllables in your flowery description. The only question is, how will the reader respond? If it heightens the drama for the reader — because it makes you love the protagonist or hate the villain; . . . because it tears at your heart; because it turns your expectations upside down — then it belongs in the book. Jim always preaches, never miss an opportunity to maximize the drama. Why speak quietly when you can shout? Why quietly acquiesce to misfortune when you can lash out? Why jab a finger when you can throw a punch? Why throw a punch when you can engage in a high-speed shootout? Why a soft kiss and not a sizzling romp in bed? Turn. Up. The. Heat. And then, when you’ve turned up the heat as high as you can — turn it up higher.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-10-16,"‘The Song Machine,’ by John Seabrook","In my 20s I wrote about music for Rolling Stone magazine, which put me in contact with all sorts of record business people — artists, hustlers, machers, you know the cast. Many of them were aggressive and arrogant and flaunting their success at Mr. Chow or in St. Barts. It was the ’90s, and as an industry the music biz was doing better than it ever had. In 1999 worldwide revenue was $27 billion, and it looked like nothing but blue sky ahead. John Seabrook’s well-researched new book about the industry covers the sharp downward slope that followed. The people I knew combed the country looking for the next hit makers and chatted with global conglomerates about acquisitions and weekended in the Hamptons, with no idea that the end of the party was right around the corner. That their industry was going to contract so much that in 2014 worldwide revenue would be $15 billion, not much more than half of what it had been at its peak. There’s still a music business, but it’s a lot less profitable and a lot less arrogant than it used to be.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/books/review/the-song-machine-by-john-seabrook.html

We begin with a man stumbling down a road with no pigment in his skin, no shoes on his feet and no idea who or where or when he is. Behind him, a crashed plane sends off waves of fire and a pillar of smoke. He might have survived the crash or he might have caused it; he doesn’t know. He knows only that he’s here — in Redemption, Ariz. — to save a man whose body is inconveniently being lowered into a hilltop cemetery at that very moment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/books/review/thrillers.html

As a noncontroversial counterpoint to dinner-table hot buttons like religion and politics, weather has probably played analgesic for generations of families. And then, of course, weather turned into climate, which combined all of the above, and suddenly there was nothing less safe in the world. As Lauren Redniss writes in “Thunder and Lightning: Weather Past, Present, Future,” weather is the state of the atmosphere, whereas climate describes prevailing weather patterns on a larger scale. “But changes to climate, by definition, mean changes in the weather.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/books/review/thunder-and-lightning-by-lauren-redniss.html

I was moved when mothers described the joy of bonding this way, but people talked a lot about antibodies, too. One night at a party, a woman I barely knew told me all about colostrum, racial disparities in breast-feeding rates and how I absolutely had to have a hands-free pump. By the time the teacher at our hospital birth class announced that she wouldn’t explain how to use formula because it was against hospital regulations, I was pretty fed up. I wasn’t sure if it was formula itself or talking about it that was against the rules, but either way I had had enough of the righteous zeal that surrounds breast-feeding.

A kestrel’s small, wickedly curved beak is specially notched with a “tomial tooth,” which affords the bird can-opener-like efficiency. Common to all falcons, this adaptation is used to sever the spines of struggling prey with a single well-placed bite.

2015-10-19,What’s On TV Monday,"10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) WILD TALES (2015) If it bleeds, it leads: A model boards a plane and enters a kind of “Twilight Zone” reunion involving her former boyfriend, a musician who was delivered a soul-crushing critique. A waitress in a greasy spoon with a rat problem realizes that her customer is responsible for the demise of her family. A crazy case of road rage resembles a standoff between the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. A wealthy family pins a crime on its gardener. And love and jealousy blow up a wedding. Each of the six tales in Damián Szifron’s Argentine anthology — titled “Relatos Salvajes” in Spanish, and an Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film — begins on a savage note. How they end is kind of up to the viewer. “It’s a mad, mad social Darwinian world, churning with men and women who, whether pushed a lot or just a little, are all eager to do the worst to one another,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

2015-10-19,The Fabulously Quirky World of Wes Anderson’s Partner,"‘‘IT’S QUITE POWERFUL to be from nowhere,’’ says the designer-turned-author Juman Malouf. Born in Beirut, raised in Saudi Arabia and London, educated at Brown University and now splitting her time between Paris and New York with her partner, Wes Anderson, the 40-year-old has parlayed her perspective as a peripatetic outsider into a charming new novel aimed at middle-schoolers, ‘‘The Trilogy of Two.’’ The lavishly illustrated fable of twin orphans growing up in a traveling circus in what Malouf calls a ‘‘futuristic Dickensian world’’ was inspired by personal touchstones ranging from Charlotte Brontë to August Sander to her superstitious grandmother who believed in fortune-telling, and reflects Malouf’s distinctive sense of style, which seems vaguely late Victorian but ultimately unmoored to a time or place. A former fashion designer (she co-founded the early-aughts cult label Charlotte Corday) and theater costumer, she favors prim vintage dresses, faded florals and a signature half-pinned hairstyle she describes as ‘‘messy 1940s.’’ She could easily fit, unadulterated, into a quirky Anderson production, giving Margot Tenenbaum a run for her money, and is the perfect foil for the 46-year-old director, with his bespoke tweeds and Wildean pageboy.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/t-magazine/wes-anderson-partner-profile.html

2015-10-20,A New San Francisco Boutique for Fashion-Starved Locals,"For a city ostensibly fixated on the future, San Francisco offers a retail fashion scene so safe it can seem retrograde. Sure, there are outposts of casual good taste and the on-trend-enough shops of Hayes Valley, but for women of a certain sartorial spirit — those seeking a world-class source of adventurous, cool-girl clothes by cult designers — the best the city has to offer sometimes feels like the e-commerce software invented here. Now, however, San Francisco has a brick-and-mortar boutique innovating at the same level as the city’s tech start-ups and artisanal coffee shrines. Nestled on a leafy residential street near Dolores Park in the Mission district, Anaïse isn’t new, exactly. It has for four years been operating as an online-only store from an even less likely location, San Jose, where its owner — Renee Friedrich, a former pharmacist from Maryland — moved “for love,” she says. (Friedrich’s Bay Area clients had been asking her to open a shop all along, though it’s perhaps telling that the majority of her online customers are from New York.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/t-magazine/san-francisco-clothing-shop-anaise.html

Since then, he has opened three additional delis, each with its own dedicated bakery program that pumps out the same little breads, and published four best-selling cookbooks. But he’s kept the coveted cornbread recipe a secret — until now. Its brunch incarnation — sweeter than the savory original, and paired with roasted peaches and maple cream — is just one of over 120 recipes in Ottolenghi’s new “Nopi: The Cookbook” ($40, out tomorrow from Ten Speed Press), co-authored with the Soho restaurant’s head chef, Ramael Scully.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/t-magazine/breakfast-recipes-cookbook-yotam-ottolenghi.html

Montblanc timepieces are now the only watches being made with the famed Minerva components, still manufactured by the several dozen employees of the factory nestled in the mountain village of Villeret. From the new 1858 collection — which harks back to the year that Minerva, which outfitted soldiers during both World Wars, was founded — the Tachymeter Limited Edition sports a manually wound chronograph with subtle and inventive midcentury flourishes. The crisp white numbers stand out against the black dial, cased in rose gold. A refined black alligator strap is attached to vintage-style lugs, and instead of the traditional individual pushers placed at 2 and 4 o’clock, they are combined in a single sleek unit within a crown so regal it looks as though it could be trimmed in ermine.

This while knowing that on the Big Story that forever haunts this land — a peace settlement between its two peoples — there’s apt to be no story at all, that on one’s deathbed 30 or 40 years from now, this newspaper is likely to run a story titled “Mideast Peace Talks Falter.” Truly, could any job be worse?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/doomed-to-succeed-by-dennis-ross.html

Their conclusion, I expect, would be that the single most important decision these inscrutable humans make each year is whether to plant corn, soybeans or wheat. No decision, year after year, transforms more square miles of American land than the choice farmers make about which crops to grow. In some years, those aliens would see huge swaths of tight green rows of soybean; in others, more tall corn with yellow tufts; in others, an unusual abundance of wheat in, well, amber waves. Earlier this month, Rick Stern, who farms 1,500 acres in central New Jersey with his father, told me that he had just spent weeks making this very decision. He carefully studied the global market reports to learn about recent yields in Argentina and Brazil, America’s leading rivals for soybean exports.

After his girlfriend turned him in to the police, Timothy Foster confessed to the crime. Foster lived in a housing project a few blocks from his victim. He was 18 and black. She was 79 and white. Choosing the jury that would decide whether Foster deserved to be executed, the prosecutors sent home four potential black jurors. They gave reasons that they said were unrelated to race, as the Supreme Court requires, but that seem unconvincing. The prosecutors said they struck one black woman from the jury because, at 34, she was too close to Foster’s age. They said they excluded a black man because his wife worked at a hospital. But so did a white woman who was asked to sit on the jury, which, in the end, was entirely white.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/the-soft-evidence-behind-the-hard-rhetoric-of-deterrence.html

In a rejoinder that also had nothing to do with the merits of the case at hand, Justice Clarence Thomas sneered that however small the accused’s current solitary prison quarters might be, they are “a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos ­Antonio Zamora and Jose Luis Rositas, now rest.” In his dissent in a case upholding the structure of federal tax subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed the majority opinion as “pure applesauce” and sniffed that the law should be better named “Scotuscare.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/dissent-and-the-supreme-court-by-melvin-i-urofsky.html

2015-10-23,"Review: ‘Tokyo Tribe,’ Sion Sono’s Hip-Hop Musical","Even by the standards of the Japanese provocateur Sion Sono, “Tokyo Tribe” is an eccentric project: a hip-hop musical, its dialogue delivered almost entirely in rhymes, set in a near-future Tokyo ruled by rival gangs. It has a message, about the corrosive effects of the yakuza, but what matters is Mr. Sono’s endless dexterity in moving masses of dancing, running and fighting people around big junkyard-like sets. The film has a simultaneously frantic and droning flow frequently punctuated by the bare breasts, panty shots and baroque violence familiar from Sono opuses like “Cold Fish” and “Love Exposure.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/movies/review-tokyo-tribe-sion-sonos-hip-hop-musical.html

After a flurry of standout lead and supporting roles in the early ’70s (in the likes of “End of the Road,” “Klute” and “Scarecrow”), the strikingly beautiful and very talented Ms. Tristan was not always well used by Hollywood, so it’s regrettable to have to note that this comeback is not an altogether auspicious one.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/movies/review-in-the-looking-glass-an-aging-actress-mentors-a-troubled-granddaughter.html

The 14-year-old Hirut (Tizita Hagere) is asking because her newfound defender, Meaza (the Ethiopian star Meron Getnet), lives alone in her Addis Ababa apartment, without a man and perhaps therefore without morals.

And it does so while trying to pump laughs from the threat of beheadings and honor killings alongside crude yuks about bedding Danielle Steel — questionable fodder made worse partly by some colossal bad timing: President Obama recently announced that American troops would remain, through 2017, in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has made a comeback and the so-called Islamic State is on the rise.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/movies/in-rock-the-kasbah-who-cares-about-war-when-theres-money-to-be-made.html

A statement issued jointly by the agencies, Unicef, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization, also said that at least 30,000 people in Unity State, in the north-central part of South Sudan, had fallen into the “catastrophe” phase of food insecurity — the most dire — and are “living in extreme conditions and are facing starvation and death.” Some families, the statement said, are subsisting on one meal a day of fish and water lilies. Despite a number of peace pledges made by the warring sides, fighting has persisted in South Sudan. Serge Tissot, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s representative in South Sudan, said in the statement that “livelihoods have been severely affected by high inflation rates, market disruption, conflict-related displacement and loss of livestock and agricultural production.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/world/africa/south-sudan-thousands-face-starvation-un-warns.html

Think of yourself as a way-out-there outfielder. Sometimes, Hample is on his feet the whole game, scampering back and forth in the bleachers from left field to right. Don’t stay in your ticketed seat unless you have to. Seek out designated standing areas or move to an aisle seat in a sparsely populated row. ‘‘Lateral mobility is key,’’ Hample says. In the off-season, he writes books about baseball and works at Argosy, his family’s Manhattan bookstore. During the season, he traverses the country as a so-called ball hawk, snagging balls that he stores in giant plastic barrels in his mother’s basement. (Highlights have included Alex Rodriguez’s 3,000th-career-hit ball and the first major-league home run hit by Mike Trout, the reigning American League M.V.P.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/how-to-catch-a-baseball-in-the-stands.html

2015-10-23,"‘Grant Park,’ by Leonard Pitts Jr.","Maybe it’s time, here in the twilight years of a history-making presidency, to consider the possibilities for what we might come to call Obama Fiction. Our country’s first black head of state has already, of course, come alive on the pages of his own books, as well as in a growing cottage industry of unauthorized portraits, from the paranoid to the all-but-­exhilarated. But another, perhaps higher, test of any cultural figure’s staying power is how well he fares in the realm of the purely or partly imaginative. “Grant Park,” the third novel from the Pulitzer Prize-winning, nationally syndicated Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr., might be best understood as an early salvo in the effort to encase Barack Obama in the amber of lasting literature.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/grant-park-by-leonard-pitts-jr.html
2015-10-23,Poetic and Lifelike Botanical Sculptures,"‘‘EVERY PLANT NEEDS a system to grow, but there is also that X factor, something wonderful and wild that messes with the symmetry and balance,’’ says the 65-year-old American artist Carmen Almon. ‘‘That little bit of mystery is what’s real to me.’’ It is Almon’s ability to capture organic quirks that makes her botanical sculptures so remarkably lifelike and at the same time uncanny, existing just beyond the borders of the natural. Delicately rendered from the least delicate of materials (copper sheeting, brass tubing) and colored with enamel paint — they’re an adaptation of the tole style traditionally used to decorate metal lamps and trays. Almon’s wildflowers, weeds and vegetable plants are inspired by the abundant greenery that surrounds her country home in southwestern France and by her collection of detailed 17th- and 18th-century botanical drawings, as well as her own imaginings. Her unique creations have captivated a small but discerning set of collectors including Deeda Blair, Carolina Herrera and interior designer Howard Slatkin, for whom Almon worked as an art director in the 1980s, painting everything from silk fabrics to furniture. It was during this era that Blair, a client of Slatkin’s, asked Almon to restore a metal flower sculpture by the late Chicago artist Mary Munnecke — and so introduced her to the world of tole.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/t-magazine/poetic-and-lifelike-botanical-sculptures.html

It was an act of celebration and of ownership by Barack Obama — a man who, just before he became president six years earlier, defined marriage as “the union between a man and a woman.” Back then Obama added: “It’s also a sacred union.

Heads separated from their bodies, bodies relieved of their limbs, unforgettable starving children, pictures burned into the collective retina of the time. In “Under the Udala Trees,” the first novel by the ­Nigerian-born writer Chinelo Okparanta (following her story collection, “Happiness, Like Water,” which was shortlisted for the Caine Prize), the protagonist, ­Ijeoma, is a child, a bystander to those horrific days. Her father refuses on principle to hide in the family bunker and is killed in an air raid. Her mother, unable to bear this loss, collapses. Not everyone rises to heroism in hard times. Unable to care for her daughter, she farms out ­Ijeoma to a friend in another town, a grammar-school teacher and his wife, to be used as their servant.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/under-the-udala-trees-by-chinelo-okparanta.html

In Marra’s Kirovsk there’s a polluted man-made lake surrounded by a dozen smokestacks that locals have named the Twelve Apostles; more memorable still is the White Forest, a field of metal and plastic birches planted in Soviet times by the local party boss’s wife, to combat the city’s reputation as an eyesore. Everything about the place reeks of disaster, even the name: Sergei Kirov was a Bolshevik whose assassination — probably on Stalin’s orders — became a pretext for the show trials of the 1930s. And since Marra’s preoccupation is history, and its ability to both erase and lend meaning to individual lives, Kirovsk is a fitting centerpiece for his audacious, strange and occasionally brilliant book.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/books/review/the-tsar-of-love-and-techno-by-anthony-marra.html

But then a few critics weighed in, including Mark Bowden of Vanity Fair and Peter Bergen of CNN, both of whom wrote books in the immediate aftermath of the Bin Laden raid. “It’s not often that the most distinguished journalistic institution in America wades so fully into the crackpot world of Internet theorizing, where all information, no matter its source, is weightless and equal,” Bowden wrote on Vanity Fair’s website.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/magazine/joe-biden-the-bin-laden-raid-and-the-ambiguities-of-recent-history.html

You will, however, be able to find stories about Sherlaw Kombs, and Solar Pons, and Picklock Holes, and Shamrock Jolnes, and Warlock Bones and (my own pick of the pseudo-Holmeses) Hemlock Jones, who in Bret Harte’s “The Stolen Cigar-Case” almost destroys the ardently worshipful Watson-like narrator with the sheer puissance of his intellect. On Hemlock Jones’s shelves are glass jars containing “pavement and road sweepings” and “fluff from omnibus and road-car seats.” When he thinks, his head shrinks, “so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears.” Jones’s diamond-­encrusted cigar case, a present from the Turkish ambassador, has gone missing. There can be only one culprit: the narrator himself! Jones lays out the case, deduction by damning deduction. “So overpowering was his penetration,” declares the narrator in a fit of purest proto-Kafka, “that although I knew myself innocent, I licked my lips with avidity to hear the further details of this lucid exposition of my crime.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/books/review/the-big-book-of-sherlock-holmes-stories-and-kareem-abdul-jabbars-mycroft-holmes.html

2015-10-26,"‘John le Carré: The Biography,’ and Frederick Forsyth’s ‘The Outsider’","David Cornwell, known to us as John le Carré, spent five and a half years in Britain’s secret services — two years in MI5 (domestic security, roughly equivalent to the F.B.I.), a “dead-end sort of place” from which he then transferred to the more glamorous MI6 (overseas intelligence). He had also done some intelligence work at Oxford and, earlier, Bern (tracking students attending left-wing meetings). Few writers have made better use of on-the-job training. The secret service has been source material for a long line of novelists, but it was le Carré who made it a permanent part of the literary landscape, giving us a fictional world so convincingly imagined that even its real-life inhabitants began to confuse the two, adopting his invented argot — “the Cousins,” “scalp­hunters,” “lamplighters,” “mole,” etc. — as their own. So blurred did these lines become that the Oxford English Dictionary had to conduct a lengthy usage search before deciding that “mole” had indeed been popularized in “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.” His 23 books have sold millions of copies, and 10 have been filmed. Anyone writing about espionage is invariably compared with him. The debate, often fueled by commercial envy and mandarin snobbery, about whether he is a genre writer who “transcends” the genre or a serious writer of distinction is by now so tired as to be pointless. He is by any standard one of the important literary figures of the postwar period.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/books/review/john-le-carre-the-biography-and-frederick-forsyths-the-outsider.html

In between, we passed a few boutiques selling local designer cashmere and skimpy leather club wear, but business was slow, and 20-somethings were nowhere to be found on the streets — or on the dating app. It’s why, he says, the islands’ sheep farmers and fishermen are now starting families with people not native to the region — from as far away as Thailand and the Philippines — and who weren’t raised on classic recipes for puffin stuffed with cake, or boiled sheep’s head.

And though he said he was not Native American (he was one-quarter Luiseño), Mr. Scholder was part of the New American Indian Art movement, which brought Native American artists into the contemporary art world and infused their work with more freedom, more possibility and more visibility.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/arts/design/denver-art-museum-strengthens-commitment-to-native-american-work.html

On that land is a hospice center and home for Medicaid recipients; residents were reportedly given about 15 months to relocate. Some said they had nowhere to go and were very distressed at the prospect of moving. The facility has apparently been in poor financial condition and was forced to sell. Discussing this story, my friends and I agreed that the school acted in keeping with its educational mission and that the facility’s owners appear to have had little choice. However, a heated discussion ensued as to the ethical obligations of the buyer and the seller with regard to facilitating a harm-free transition for the residents. Some felt that the onus falls entirely on the seller. Others felt that the school should share in smoothing the potential disruption to these people’s lives. What do you think?

But the church was built to last, and it’s still solid at nearly 125 years old.

But her cuff could zip shut to seal out the wind, and he was playing with its pull. Zip, and then unzip; he was enchanted.

An exploration of Renaissance dance and its pageantry, the work, “Fortuna Desperata,” is also an all-too-rare opportunity to see Mr. Hallberg onstage since a foot injury forced him out of his scheduled performances with the Bolshoi Ballet and American Ballet Theater last spring. It’s unlikely that the premiere, which will be presented twice on Sunday night at St. Bartholomew’s Church in Midtown Manhattan, will feature Mr. Hallberg in his virtuosic mode, but we’ll take his elegant, potent presence any way we can. As Performa 15 continues, another likely highlight will be the return of the French choreographer Jérôme Bel, who unveils “Ballet (New York),” a premiere taking place in three spaces across the city — a theater, dance studio and gallery — that incorporates a group of local performers. Their task? To respond to a series of instructions masterminded by Mr. Bel, revealing, in the end, many sides of what dance can be.

2015-10-28,Classical Playlist: ‘Poetry in Music’ and Gilles Vonsattel,"‘POETRY IN MUSIC’The Sixteen; Harry Christophers, conductor(Coro)In the liner notes for this rewarding album of 14 a cappella vocal works, Harry Christophers, the conductor of the vocal ensemble the Sixteen, wonders what composers would do without poets and dramatists. Usually, he writes, the better the text, the more inspired the composer. But actually, certain great poems resist musical settings. Music has to be able to add something. But the British composers represented here, covering five centuries, all chose distinguished texts and responded with extraordinary music. William Harris’s 1925 anthem for double chorus “Faire is the Heaven” (an Edmund Spenser poem), which opens the album, conveys the text through surging, intensely mystical music with effective back-and-forth exchanges. Tippett’s “Dance, clarion air” (words by Christopher Fry), unfolds with stabbing chords and jumpy repetitions, sounding almost giddy. The program is built around four austerely poignant settings by Tudor- and early-Stuart-era composers (Thomas Weelkes, Robert Ramsey, Michael East and Thomas Tomkins) of “When David Heard,” from the Biblical story of the slaying of Absalom. Britten’s remarkable “Hymn to Saint Cecilia” (words by Auden) is the longest piece here. There are also exceptional works by Edmund Rubbra, Herbert Howells and others. The performances are beautiful and brilliant. (Anthony Tommasini)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/classical-playlist-poetry-in-music-and-gilles-vonsattel/

Playing on the idioms of post-Internet culture, the young video artist’s Instagram acts as an alternative outlet for her impressive skills as an animator and filmmaker, and for her outlandish sense of humor. “Reality TV and Instagram have their own languages,” says the Cooper Union graduate. “I like toying with the familiar and then making it into something else.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/t-magazine/art-meriem-bennani-hijab-video.html

2015-10-28,36 Hours in San Francisco,"Don’t blink or you’ll miss the next “new” San Francisco. This is a city that’s reinventing itself with every refresh of your Twitter feed, with cranes rising all over downtown and an army of young tech workers pouring into neighborhoods across the city. In the ’60s, San Francisco was synonymous with the hippie counterculture; in the ’90s, it was the dot-com boom (and eventual bust, in the early 2000s); more recently, it was the ripening of the Bay Area food movement. Now it’s home to such new-establishment icons of the digital economy as Airbnb, Uber and, yes, Twitter. But don’t be fooled by the shiny patina: San Francisco is more than just the physical headquarters of our virtual world. There are some things that haven’t changed, and by themselves, are reason enough to revisit: the mind-boggling views along that glorious waterfront; the Mission’s still-feisty, freaky, welcome-all-comers character; the meandering natural pleasures of Golden Gate Park. Even when classic San Francisco rubs up against new San Francisco, the friction, though at times contentious (Google bus protests, the anti-eviction fight), is also where the community-conscious activist roots of this city are as vital and visible as ever.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-san-francisco.html

But the weakness of the case against Rubio-as-the-frontrunner is that it’s hard to identify who else would actually beat him: You either have to assert that Donald Trump or Ben Carson could actually win through (a possibility I still don’t take seriously, for reasons I may elaborate on at some point), or argue that someone with weaker fundamentals and weaker poll numbers than Rubio will end up beating him.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/why-not-cruz/

The actresses became fast friends during production last year, and their affection isn’t evident just on screen. In an interview recently at the J. W. Marriott Essex House near Central Park, they sat side by side, fingers intertwined, like characters from a Louisa May Alcott tale, and talked about the label “chick flick,” why there was no blubbering on the set and the Catch-22 of the “Ask Her More” red carpet campaign urging journalists to pose better questions.

2015-10-29,Review: Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center Spotlights Albéric Magnard,"In the pantheon of composers who died under memorable circumstances, Albéric Magnard (1865-1914) occupies a special place.

You expect there to be a certain amount — well, a lot — of death in a King book, and he does his best, as ever, to deliver the mortal goods. What’s unusual about the tales in this volume is how many of its deaths are ordinary, mundane sorts of demises: deaths by cancer or heart failure or car accident or simple, non-­supernatural homicide. Sure, in “Mile 81,” the long, nearly self-parodic horror story that kicks off the book, a few people are sucked into a mysteriously voracious station wagon at an abandoned rest stop, and some, in later yarns, meet their ends with the help of otherworldly agencies: a sand dune on which the names of the soon to be dead are written, a “bad little kid” who doesn’t age and who drives his victims to suicide — that kind of Kingian thing. But to a surprising extent King tries to play it straight in this collection. And that seems to make him a little nervous.

What secrets do we hope they will impart? Some promise to make us better cooks; others, to save us time or improve our health.

We see him walking through an empty village — it looks like an old southern European town during siesta time — then taking a stroll out to the country, “slowly, slowly, so as not to upset his caps.” He naps sitting upright under a tree and awakens to find his wares gone. Up in the branches, monkeys are wearing the caps. Shaking his finger at them, he tells them to give back the caps. They shake their monkey fingers right back at him. The monkeys imitate him each time he makes his demand, until finally, in disgust, he throws his own checked cap to the ground. The monkeys, of course, do the same, and he is able to retrieve his caps, restack them on his head, and walk back to town.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/books/review/more-caps-for-sale-esphyr-slobodkina-review.html

2015-10-30,Mexico: Sugary-Drinks Tax Is Left Intact," Mexico’s congress blocked an attempt to roll back part of a tax on soft drinks Thursday, responding to an uproar from public health advocates. The tax of about 10 percent, imposed two years ago, was intended to attack Mexico’s obesity epidemic by raising the price for sugar-added drinks. Last week, the lower house of congress proposed to cut the tax in half for some drinks with less sugar. Consumer groups, along with national and international health groups, urged Mexico’s Senate to restore the full tax, which it did Thursday, and the lower house quickly followed suit. By leaving the tax in place, Mexico “assured that this tax will remain a model for similar measures in the U.S. and around the world,” said former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York., whose philanthropy supports the Mexican groups that pushed for the tax. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/world/americas/mexico-sugary-drinks-tax-is-left-intact.html

Lu is something of a young elite herself — all five of her novels have been best sellers since her debut, “Legend,” hit the list in 2013, when Lu was 28. But until she was a teenager, she recently acknowledged, she didn’t understand that actual people had written the stories she loved. “In my head, I thought books were just spat out of factories somewhere,” she told a school in Manila last year, according to The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Lu, who was born in China and immigrated to America with her family shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre when she was 5, told students at the International School Manila that witnessing the Tiananmen protests had influenced her writing and that she often researched real-life political horrors before turning to her dystopian novels. “There is no utopian country, and that is the way the world is,” she said. Besides, she added, dystopian authors “get to see this warped, twisted part of life, . . . and I find dark things fascinating.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/inside-the-list.html

At one point, the author of “The Woman in White” and “The Moonstone” consumed, in a single glass, enough laudanum (a potent combination of opium and alcohol) to kill 12 people. He loved cigars, drank heavily — preferably brut Champagne — and usually ate rich French food.

This event will carry intense meaning for Aaron throughout the novel: “It seemed he had been waiting his whole life to save this boy.” For until Walter’s arrival in his life, Aaron himself was a child in desperate need of rescue. He remembers imagining his bed as a boat tossed by violent weather: “In the midst of the storms, he would throw himself from the bed to the floor, where he pretended that he was swimming, staying afloat and saving his own life because there was nobody else to save him.” When he tells Walter he’s leaving, Walter says reproachfully, “I saved you, Aaron.” Indeed, Aaron leaves partly because he has learned that being saved entails debts he is no longer willing to pay.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/books/review/after-the-parade-by-lori-ostlund.html
