2023-06-01,A Sunny Parisian Cafe Inside a 19th-Century Artist’s Studio,"This spring, the recently renovated Bourdelle Museum in Paris’s Montparnasse district opened a luminous new cafe-restaurant, Le Rhodia, named after the French sculptor Antoine Bourdelle’s daughter. The spare, daffodil yellow dining room occupies the second story of a 19th-century artist’s studio where Rhodia Bourdelle and her husband, the Art Deco interior designer Michel Dufet, once lived. “We wanted it to feel like entering someone’s apartment,” says Marc-Antoine Servella, the co-founder of the Parisian architecture studio SAME, who oversaw the cafe’s design. He furnished Le Rhodia with a mix of midcentury flea market finds and custom pieces commissioned from French artisans in materials ranging from travertine to oak, while preserving a few original details like a wood-burning stove and a large oculus window (designed by Dufet in the spirit of the ocean liner cabin décor for which he was best known). Museumgoers can also dine outside on the mezzanine terrace next to a colonnade of watchful bronze busts. The menu offers refreshing fare, with culinary references to Bourdelle’s hometown in the southwest of France and a Latin American influence — a homage, says the French chef Jean-René Chassignol, to the dozens of students from Peru, Chile and Argentina who apprenticed with Bourdelle in these ateliers. Dishes, which skew on the lighter side, include a black-bean purée with pickled beets and corn nuts, and seasonal vegetable empanadas. Pastries, like the Rhodia brioche with orange-blossom cream or the honey-and-thyme-infused Madeleine d’Antoine, are served all day. instagram.com/lerhodia_bourdelle/.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/t-magazine/la-rhodia-paris-bourdelle-museum.html

When we did eventually cancel the trip, the $8,370 was “refunded” as electronic travel certificates, which makes no sense. We paid with a credit card! Two follow-up appeals have been denied.

Fox is writing Dominion Voting Systems a $787.5 million check for very good reasons, and it still faces a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Smartmatic over the channel’s election reporting. But to watch Fox News is to begin to understand millions of your fellow Americans.

After his mother’s death, Caleb was cared for by his single dad, Michael (Scott Mescudi, a.k.a. Kid Cudi), who was killed while working in the lunar mines. The film begins as the recently orphaned Caleb is to be sent to live on a faraway planet called Omega. Before he’s forced to leave, though, he takes advantage of a lockdown prompted by an impending meteor shower to gather his buddies, steal a rover and go explore a mysterious crater that may or may not hold treasure.

The film is shot on grainy, expired 16-millimeter film stock, and with a blue tint that turns even daytime scenes into something out of a twilight zone. The camera’s subjects are the wildlife of the city — owls, capybaras, snakes, foxes and more — seen in the Brasília zoo and on the streets; the soundtrack is a viscous fog of ambient noise — crickets, wind, vehicle horns — interspersed with recordings of phone calls to forest officers to report sightings of animals. These dreamlike visions all accumulate into a parable about aggressive urbanization in the name of progress. What happens when our faunal kin are made invaders in their own homes? Vaz suggests that we learn to look not just ahead but also sideways, at the things that take refuge in the shadows, in the background and in the night.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/movies/international-movies-streaming.html

Virtually all of the stories are exaggerated, misleading or simply false. And genuine voter fraud is extraordinarily rare. Still, Republican officials have for a long time rightly insisted on the importance of election integrity.

There, you can’t be taken by surprise, but nor can you hide; any feeling of liberation tends to be constrained by a barb of danger; and while you may be granted a glimpse of the infinite, you’re also made to feel hyper-aware of your own body. For Noreen Masud, a lecturer in 20th-century literature at the University of Bristol, “it’s as though the landscape is sending us a message that we’re unable to decipher.” In “A Flat Place,” she travels to five landscapes in England and Scotland in an effort to interpret them: the Cambridgeshire fens, the shingle promontory of Orford Ness, the tidal flats of Morecambe Bay, the Town Moor in Newcastle and the islands of Orkney. She also seeks to interpret their appeal, for while this is a kind of quest narrative, that quest’s true objective might be to answer the question: What am I looking for? And though the journeys together have something of the quality of a pilgrimage to a healing spring, Masud is too skeptical to anticipate any sort of nature cure.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/books/a-flat-place-noreen-masud.html

So he followed the thought and used encaustic to paint just that. He liked the geometric simplicity of concentric circles on a square panel but decided to add one flourish: In the blank space designating the record’s label, he wrote, “This Must Be the Place,” and the band responsible for the iconic ’80s song, “Talking Heads.” Today, O’Hara sells custom vinyl paintings about as fast as he can make them through Forsyth, the St. Louis design brand that he co-founded in 2015 (and that also sources vintage furniture pieces and reupholsters them with sumptuous fabrics). Customers choose the size, the color (options include black, red, blue and metallic 24-karat gold leaf) and, of course, the song or album. “There’s a strong emotional quality to them because they’re so personal,” says O’Hara, who, it seems, is not alone in having vivid memories of spinning records in his friends’ basements — the music selections tend to be dad-friendly.

In the London-based style monthly The Face, I find a cover story on “Electro: the beat that won’t be beaten.” It’s May 1984, the first wave of hip-hop is long past and this summer belongs to the Roland drum machine and the imported sounds of New York clubs. I turned 15 that month, and remember this musical cusp very well. What surprises me now in the pages of The Face: There are just the tiniest hints of the British miners’ strike and the swelling unemployment that are convulsing the country politically.

This brick-walled basement space became proof that a windowless underground location could be a destination when run by a notable chef like Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Here, Mr. Sartiano has dipped into his family’s legacy from Naples and elsewhere in Italy, alongside Alfred Portale, the culinary director. Mr. Portale will now divide his time between this location and Portale, nearby in Chelsea, and he describes his food as “elevated Italian American classics.” He adds fennel to the fritto misto, makes a broccoli rabe pesto to coat sausage and orecchiette, inserts shavings of black truffle into the mushroom lasagna, enhances savory cannoli with caviar and prepares Dover sole piccata-style. The menu lists several steaks, including a 36-ounce porterhouse of olive-fed Wagyu. (And you thought Wagyu cattle only like beer.) The open kitchen faces part of the dining room, with one communal table and exposed brick walls. The room is richly upholstered, punctuated with mirrored columns. “This space has great legacy,” Mr. Sartiano said. It will be interesting to see how many people continue to refer to it as Mercer Kitchen. (Opens Thursday) ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

I want to point out too CAConrad’s signature care for the visual impact of the poem. The disciplined shaping means that the poetic line here not only carries sound and sentiment but builds toward a striking sculptural presence. CAConrad’s is poetry that reaches for multidimensionality, and in this poem, the arc and increment of indentation is a convincer, moving with and toward the poem’s conclusion.

Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered. The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active military members, a notion that startled Dean, who was then working as an administrator at a U.S. Army medical research center in Maryland. Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling. Some complained that they didn’t have enough time to talk to their patients because they were too busy filling out electronic medical records. Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness would be preapproved for medication. The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession. But many of them were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/magazine/doctors-moral-crises.html

2023-06-15,A 40-Foot Wedding Cake in the English Countryside,"The Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos is known for her ambitious oversize sculptures that frequently elevate everyday objects. Her 2005 Venice Biennale contribution, “A Noiva” (The Bride), was a chandelier made of 14,000 tampons and “Valkyrie Miss Dior,” the imposing, tentacular fabric-wrapped installation that formed the backdrop of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s fall ’23 show for Dior, took over the show space at Paris’s Jardin des Tuileries. Vasconcelos’s newest project is her most ambitious yet: “Wedding Cake,” an almost 40-foot-high three-tiered wedding cake pavilion in pastel shades of pink, green and blue, was installed this spring on the grounds of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, England. The whimsical creation is clad in 25,000 ceramic tiles (manufactured in Vasconcelos’s native Lisbon) and adorned with ceramic cherubs, dolphins and a water feature. Commissioned by the collector and arts philanthropist Lord Jacob Rothschild, the “impossible project,” as the artist describes it, has been five years in the making and is the culmination of Vasconcelos’s long-held fascination with the dynamics of weddings: “Weddings are the most important moment in some women’s lives,” she says. “It’s the transition from one identity to another. All transition moments are marked by symbols. This is my way of working through these symbols and asking if they still make sense.” “Wedding Cake” opens June 18, waddesdon.org.uk.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/t-magazine/wedding-cake-sculpture-england.html

2023-06-15,‘Elemental’ Review: Sparks Fly,"“Elemental” is the latest Pixar premise to feel like someone laced the cafeteria’s kombucha keg with ayahuasca. Starting eight years ago with “Inside Out,” the animation company has transformed cartoons into a form of group therapy that encourages audiences to ruminate on inner peace, death (“Coco”) and resurrection (“Soul”). This story is simpler (elemental, even). It’s a girl-meets-boy cross-cultural romantic comedy — a good one that woos us to root for the big kiss. But the Pixar-brand psychotropic flourish comes from which cultures. Here, they are water, earth, air and fire — the four classical elements that the ancient philosopher Empedocles used to explain our world — all tenuously coexisting in Element City, a Manhattan analogue founded by the first droplet to ooze out of the primordial sea. The girl, Ember Lumen (voiced by Leah Lewis), is a leggy lick of flame; her crush, Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), is a drip. When she brushes near him, his body roils.

The food on the conveyor is interspersed with Mr. Masuda’s playful, glittering sculptures of sushi and stilettos. Six courses are $85. Table seats are available indoors and out. Mr. Masuda calls it the “new generation of sushi,” as entertaining as it is tasty. The chef, Kyle Puchir, is a Daniel alum.

2023-06-22,Poem: Conditions for Retention,"The coldness of the institutional jargon of Jennifer Nelson’s title stands in stark contrast to the warmth and vitality of the world evoked in the poem. Who knows what “Condition for Retention” means? Perhaps you do, but I don’t, not really. Maybe it means something about what a person has to do to earn the right to stay inside, stifled, employed, even as the earth with all its thunderstruck, sun-dazzled energy waits outside. Whatever purpose the phrase serves, there’s no denying that it sounds grim, like a cluster of words that have never themselves brought anyone joy and were never intended to. This is why Nelson’s poem made me happy. The news here turns out much better than the headline suggests.

The dam’s spillway, a concrete channel capable of moving millions of gallons of water out of the reservoir in seconds, was disintegrating in front of them.

Wade set off a seismic change, in one swoop striking down a federal right to abortion that had existed for 50 years, long enough that women of reproductive age had never lived in a world without it. As the decision triggered state bans and animated voters in the midterms, it shook complacency and forced many people to reconsider their positions.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/us/roe-v-wade-abortion-views.html

But across the floor and atop tables are lumpy earthen depictions of tree-dwelling creatures beside prominent historical figures like the American novelist Gertrude Stein. The cross-species interactions are mostly benign, as in a vignette where a girl seated on a stump is flanked by two kind-looking roosters. But some have more of an editorializing bite: To address her frustrations with Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s abortion rulings, Saul cast him as being eternally tormented by three pudgy spiders. “Some pieces are sweeter, and then I think, ‘I want to make something that’s fiercer,’” she says. “I go back and forth.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/t-magazine/sally-saul-venus-over-manhattan.html

Will the Duke of Gloucester be re-envisioned as a bloody-minded assassin like the bloody-minded Villanelle of “Killing Eve?” Will it force us to reckon with discrimination against the disabled in the royal court? As realized in this risk-shy adaptation directed by Stephen Burdman, the answer is none of the above.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/theater/richard-shakespeare-disability-female.html

Our century’s twin brutality and banality have only intensified in their recursive forms. The forever war has not ended. The news cycle hasn’t, either. Even grief itself seems to be occluded or numbed by screen life, which retains the same quality of distortion, confusion and repetition. The poem’s “no reason” for weeping is every reason to weep: that we live and die in the flickering light of spectacle and the grim shadow of war. The poem’s weeping, then, is the weeping of all and for all in this viciousness — “nothing personal is recorded here.” Selected by Anne Boyer",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/magazine/poem-from-inventory-iii.html

The founder, Fabian Kramer, also works with fire to produce the artisanal ceramic vessels that decorate the space. Mischa Amadeus Olma, a founder of Woodcuisine, arranges foraging workshops and dinners outdoors (currently in an herb garden in the leafy Mariendorf neighborhood) where he and friends offer a changing menu — one evening it was fire-grilled trout and a dessert of pancakes served with freshly foraged honeycomb — that is cooked on the sides of a steel fire ring forged by the Swiss sculptor Andreas Reichlin. Jeffrey Claudio (who has cooked at the Singapore restaurant Burnt Ends) and his partner, Jessica Tan, have opened a temporary rooftop yakitori restaurant — a tiny wood house with a dozen seats around a grill. Their permanent restaurant, Stoke, is scheduled to open next year. Ember, which started service in May, is also located on a rooftop, in a room with walls of glass and a terrace where the outdoor kitchen is located.
