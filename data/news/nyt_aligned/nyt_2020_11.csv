2020-11-03,Rolls Rice Opens With Rice Rolls Inspired by Classic Asian Dishes,"Soft, traced with sauce and enclosing various fillings, Cantonese steamed rice noodle rolls (cheung fun) have a devoted following in New York. Along with two partners, the chef Richard Chan has come up with his own interpretation, investing it with creative twists. His rolls pay homage to seven different parts of Asia, including, for Singapore, rolls slathered with typical chile crab sauce; Taipei’s Taiwanese braised pork and Chinese greens; Malaysian chicken curry; and a Hong Kong roll filled with dried shrimp, Chinese sausage, shiitake mushrooms and greens. Mr. Chan is also thinking beyond Asia, with an Italian cheung fun on the horizon. Before this, he owned a Singaporean restaurant, Yummy Tummy in Flushing, Queens, where he specialized in the food of his home country, but it closed because of the pandemic. Customers at this counter-service nook meant for takeout can also assemble their own, with a choice of fillings, sauces and garnishes.

Fortunately, there’s plenty for him to explore. Since late March, the family has been living in Chatham, in a renovated 18th-century Colonial house that once served as a general store, and that provides easy access to the sort of fresh, wholesome foods (grains, beans, nuts and seeds) and seasonal produce Chaplin is known to favor. This is what many people eat or aspire to eat today, but Chaplin, who grew up on a farm in New South Wales, Australia, and honed her skills as a private chef and at restaurants including the now-closed Angelica Kitchen in Manhattan, is able to transform her healthful ingredients — often with the help of fermented garnishes — into complex, craveable dishes, examples of which fill her two award-winning cookbooks, “At Home in the Whole Food Kitchen” (2014) and “Whole Food Cooking Every Day” (2019).",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/t-magazine/amy-chaplin-recipe-onigiri.html

Indeed, it met the criteria for architectural significance laid out by New York’s Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2008, when the organization extended the eastern limit of NoHo’s official historic district, in an effort to maintain the 19th-century vernacular of the small pocket of cobblestone streets that runs between Lafayette and the Bowery, and East Fourth and Bond Streets. Once a booming commercial corridor, the district sprung up during the 1890s, its mix of Romanesque, Revival and Classical styles defined by some of the most noted firms of the day. But this particular building’s well-preserved exterior belies what’s inside on its fifth floor.

2020-11-10,"In Berlin, Mysterious Dwellings Hidden Amid the Trees","A DECADE AGO, when I lived in Berlin, I would often detour from my daily run through Tiergarten, the city’s appealingly untended park, to visit certain buildings I felt drawn to for reasons I couldn’t name. These were largely (though not exclusively) midcentury dwellings — some neglected, others wildly overgrown — on or in the park that seemed to reify my sense of the city’s layered strangeness, of its mystery and opportunity for discovery. Even more than other European cities, Berlin is marked by the remains of all kinds of ideologies past, from the TV Tower in the vast main square, Alexanderplatz, a retro-future icon erected in the late 1960s by the East German government in a now poignant display of might, to the buildings the Nazis left behind. (Hitler never did fully realize his vision of a rebuilt Berlin as the capital of “Germania,” but the kind of neo-Classical bombast he had in mind is evident in the Olympic Stadium, which he commissioned shortly after he took power in 1933 and was completed in time for the 1936 Summer Games, and the limestone Tempelhof Airport terminal, which was constructed between 1936 and 1941 and, following the war, became a site of the airlift that sustained the city with food and supplies when Stalin blocked access to West Berlin.) All architecture conveys a set of narratives, histories and values for how best to live, and today’s Berlin, a jumble of tragedy and utopian ambitions past — and, these days, encroaching foreign investment — can feel like an especially dark choose-your-own-adventure story.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/t-magazine/berlin-treehouses.html

Plans were not just delayed: They were adjusted to accommodate required safety protocols and to adapt to what Mr. Strausman saw as long-term changes restaurants would have to make. Greater emphasis was placed on the spacious outdoor terrace, with partial enclosures and heaters to permit dining in colder weather. Inside, the bar will not be available for seating but will display retail baked goods, including Mr. Strausman’s bagels, baked in-house and made popular during his many years as the executive chef for Fred’s at Barneys. Touch-free systems for ordering and paying are in place. An airy room, done in pale wood tones, is divided into two areas with seating for a total of 26 at the moment. Part of the kitchen is set aside for takeout and delivery. “It’s probably going to make up almost half of our business from what I can see,” he said. “This winter, it will be the norm.” The menu lists what Mr. Strausman calls his “greatest hits,” including Estelle’s chicken soup, lasagna della nonna, sautéed chicken livers, smoked fish platters and coffee cake for brunch. At dinner, he’s also serving slow-roasted chicken in the style of Nanni Il Valetto in honor of Luigi Nanni’s Upper East Side restaurant.

Influenced by Cubism’s fractured light and geometry, as well as the motion of Étienne-Jules Marey’s pioneering chronophotography, Balla captured the era’s dynamism with such paintings as his 1912 “Girl Running on a Balcony” but also turned his brightly hued abstractions into furniture, lampshades and avant-garde clothing. In 1917, he flipped over a couple of discarded photographs and sketched a folding screen, coloring it with tempera and pencil. The drawing remained unpublished until it appeared in a 1968 Balla monograph, but now Cassina has produced the partition, silk-screened on both sides of an asymmetrically cut wooden armature with satin-brass hinges. The colors pictured here are those that Balla himself specified: a smoldering combination of cinnabar, citron and deep forest.

2020-11-11,4 Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now,"Jonathan Lyndon Chase’s New York solo debut at Company in 2018 introduced a remarkable young painter. The artist’s sophomore effort, “Wind Rider,” at Baby Company — Company’s new project space — provides ample corroboration. It continues a startlingly frank, exuberant exploration of the intersection of race, homoeroticism and personal identity. The new paintings introduce the additional subversive theme of the gay Black cowboy, and with it, lawlessness and the myth of straight white masculinity. The riches of this territory are once more conveyed by entanglements of bodies and faces, now joined by horses, cowboy hats and hints of frontier buildings. All motifs benefit from ingenious combinations of strident drawing and suave stained color; they are often simultaneously transparent and opaque, explicit and mysterious. Graffiti, spray paint and glitter are used.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/arts/design/art-gallery-shows-to-see-right-now.html

After Mehta’s son was born, he was taken to the N.I.C.U. because of his premature delivery. Mehta and her husband were anxious to get him out. They left the hospital as soon as he hit the four-pound mark, “by the skin of our teeth,” Mehta’s husband Jed said.",Parenting,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/parenting/parents-kids-coronavirus.html

2020-11-12,How ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ Foretold Our Era of Grifting,"THERE’S AN ART to imposture. It’s the how they did it, I think, rather than the self-evident why, that keeps us fascinated by tales of con artists and “visionaries,” the gurus and hucksters, schemers and dreamers, the online dating scammers — all of our 21st-century buccaneers of society, politics and commerce. From the small-time grifters like Anna Sorokin, who adopted the last name Delvey to masquerade in downtown New York circles as a European heiress for four years before she was convicted of second-degree grand larceny in 2019, to the murderous faux WASP “Clark Rockefeller,” as the serial impostor Christian Gerhartsreiter was known until his clubby life was upended by kidnapping charges in 2008, all impostors come equipped with a tall tale and a look to match. In Sorokin’s case, it seemed to be largely about the chunky Celine glasses, code for jolie-laide cool; in Gerhartsreiter’s, it was the Lacoste shirts and East Coast lockjaw copied from the millionaire character on “Gilligan’s Island.” The nose ring and “street” argot of Jessica Krug, a.k.a., Jess La Bombalera — the white professor of history and Africana studies whose career until a few months ago had rested in good part upon a racial identity that was not, in fact, her own — the black turtlenecks and baritone of Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes, accused of defrauding investors of millions with shoddy blood-testing technology, even the normcore terry-cloth sweatband and neuroleptic philosophizing of Nxivm’s Keith Raniere, the volleyball enthusiast who ran a self-actualization scheme that preyed upon the bodies and wallets of women: All have become metonyms of the actual offenses, clues to self-delusions.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/t-magazine/mr-ripley.html

2020-11-12,Revisiting an Ancient Theory of Herbalism,"HOW, I HAVE often wondered, did people first discover the highly specific applications of particular plants and herbs? That ginseng improves energy, say, or that ginger alleviates nausea, or that horsetail, which contains silica, might help hair to grow? One theory, possibly apocryphal and certainly much maligned by modern medicine, is that the physical characteristics of plants themselves provided clues as to how they might be used. This notion, known among scholars of ethnobotany and practitioners of herbal medicine as the doctrine of signatures, holds that plants have a “signature” — color, texture, shape, scent, even the environment in which they grow — that resembles the body parts and diseases they heal. Thus bloodroot, or Sanguinaria canadensis, whose roots and rhizomes secrete a red sap when cut, was once thought to heal blood disorders and hasten wound healing. And eyebright, or euphrasia, whose flowers resemble the human eye (or rather, with its yellow dots and purple stripes, a jaundiced, bloodshot one), has for centuries been used to treat ocular ailments, like conjunctivitis. (In German, eyebright is called Augentrost, or “consolation of the eyes.”) Signatures, in other words, made it easy to divine a plant’s medicinal properties.

Although Hardy had overseen the company’s standard jewelry collection since 2001, he knew little about precious gems and elaborate settings. Nevertheless, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the scion and creative director of the 183-year-old brand, was confident that Hardy’s talent for creating objects that are both easy to wear and transcendent would prove enough. As might be expected of someone who began his career as a ballet dancer, the designer’s sinuous pieces don’t merely adorn the body, they pour over it. This necklace, a serpentine armature of rose gold with pavé diamonds, incorporates an elegant palette that is pure Hermès: apple-green prehnite cabochons, a pale blue-gray sapphire and pink, brown and blue tourmalines. At once subtle and sumptuous, the collar is engineered as cleverly as a good stiletto: You barely know you’re wearing it.

You are left to hobble, if that; the flutter of a bedsheet over the distended foot is anguish enough, let alone the full weight of the body bearing down. To take a step is to see the abyss. Often the pain is concentrated in the big toe, ridiculous, stubby and chubby, Napoleonic, the fat piggy sent to market. So acute is the sensitivity of this bloated hallux — “so exquisite and lively,” in the words of the 17th-century English physician Thomas Sydenham, chronicling his bouts with the disease — that the faintest footfall of a sympathetic visitor is a gunshot straight to the nerve. The American poet and novelist Jim Harrison, writing in 1991, likened his throes to those of “a wolf with the steel teeth of a trap buried in its paw.” It will not help, at such a moment, to recall that Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton and Henry James reportedly suffered thus, and that you have joined, in your abasement, the noblest ranks.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/t-magazine/gout-tormenting-masses.html

2020-11-13,A Bold Bulgari Necklace That Reimagines a Late-’60s Design,"Bulgari opened its first jewelry shop on Via Sistina in Rome in 1884 and soon became known for its bold combinations of precious and semiprecious stones. Many of the house’s most arresting designs were created in the ’50s and ’60s, including the 1969 sautoir necklace — a heart-shaped emerald pendant, weighing over 127 carats, surrounded by cabochon-cut gems of ruby, citrine, amethyst, turquoise and topaz. Shortly after it came off the workbench, the piece — which converted into two bracelets — was shot for American Vogue, its magnificent links draped across the model Veruschka’s scarf-covered head. It was then bought by a Genevese collector, who purchased it for his wife. Decades later, Bulgari came across a 1975 oil portrait of a woman wearing what looked to be the very same necklace. Two years ago, the house bought back the piece when it came up for auction at Sotheby’s and returned it to its archives.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/t-magazine/bulgari-necklace.html

2020-11-17,Can America Restore the Rule of Law Without Prosecuting Trump?,"Early in November, as President Trump challenged the integrity of the election with baseless lawsuits, Joe Biden delivered his first speech as president-elect, declaring it a “time to heal.” It was a phrase that many Americans were surely longing to hear, given the precarious state of the nation’s political culture. But it was also one that carried significant historical weight and possible implications for the future. When President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, he, too, spoke about the need for “healing.” (Ford titled his subsequent memoir “A Time to Heal.”) When President Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address during the waning days of the Civil War, he spoke in similar terms about the imperative to “bind up the nation’s wounds.” Whether Biden intended to do so, his words provided an early signal about one of the first questions he is going to confront as president: What to do about Donald Trump? Biden faces many daunting challenges — mitigating the ongoing damage from the pandemic, repairing institutions, restoring faith in government — but how to deal with his predecessor’s flagrant and relentless subversion of the rule of law is in many ways the most vexing.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/magazine/trump-investigations-criminal-prosecutions.html

2020-11-18,T Black Book: Florists,"There is, arguably, never a bad time to send flowers. But in a year marked by both isolation and turmoil, a delivery of blooms, a gift that also helps support financially hard-hit small businesses, feels especially poignant. And so for the first in our new series of Black Book guides, we’ve created a directory of the most imaginative and masterful florists working today in six major cities. These 22 designers make arrangements that are often wildly different in style, ranging from understated bouquets to experimental showpieces, and we’ve tried to offer a range of “classic,” “earthy” and “unusual” options in each place. But if these florists’ aesthetics are diverse — informed by everything from old master paintings to modern dance — they all bring a singular vision to the centuries-old art they practice. Many are also united in rejecting the methods of the contemporary globalized flower trade, in which blooms are cut sometimes months before they’re sold, sprayed with toxic preservatives and then shipped great distances at great environmental cost. Some are instead championing local growers and avoiding harmful substances like flower foam, while others are even cultivating their own flowers or privileging historically overlooked materials such as seedpods, roots and weeds. At the bottom of this article you’ll find a downloadable guide with delivery information that we hope will serve as a useful, and much turned to, resource.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/t-magazine/t-black-book-florists.html

2020-11-20,Nina Chanel Abney Imagines a Queer Black Utopia,"By the beginning of this year, the artist Nina Chanel Abney’s studio, a 1,500-square-foot space in a multiuse building in Jersey City, N.J., that she’s rented since 2018, had begun to feel like a storage room. Stacks of boxes filled with books and products she’d made, as well as paintings — both her own and ones she’d purchased — lined the walls, and the countertops of the kitchenette were barely visible beneath the countless cases of spray paint piled on top of them. When the pandemic hit New Jersey in March, and the state went into lockdown, Abney — who also lives in the building, in an apartment a few flights below — became even more aware of her spatial confines. And so, in May, she bought a bike and a rack for her car and began taking road trips to rural areas outside of the city to find some relief from all the time spent indoors. Inspired in part by these excursions, Abney’s new body of work conveys a sense of expansiveness — one that she also found in the form of an additional studio that she rented in the same building this fall. This larger temporary space, with a view of the Manhattan skyline, gave the artist enough room to finish the 22 paintings — ranging from 2 feet by 2 feet to 8 feet by 8 feet — that are currently on display in “The Great Escape,” a solo exhibition at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/t-magazine/nina-chanel-abney-queer-black-art.html

2020-11-20,San Francisco’s School Plan Could Offer Other Districts Hope,"SAN FRANCISCO — When the coronavirus came here in March, local leaders seemed to do things right. They issued the nation’s first shelter in place order, promptly shut down schools and businesses and made masks routine. It worked: The city has experienced some of the lowest test positivity rates in the country.Now, city officials are forging ahead with a tentative school reopening plan hatched earlier this month, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. The coronavirus has entered a frightening new stage nationwide — triggering school districts around the country to shutter, including in New York City and the entire state of Kentucky — and putting San Francisco on the horns of a dilemma.The district’s goal of opening some schools could bring relief to thousands of parents and students, but their plan was written for another reality. Virus rates are suddenly spiking, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday to issue a nighttime curfew affecting nearly every county in the state, though San Francisco is below the threshold. As a result, officials here face pushback from some unions, teachers and parents.Whether San Francisco ultimately proceeds can be a bellwether: If schools cannot reopen here where virus rates remain comparatively low, what hope do other cities have for a return to something resembling normalcy?There is mounting evidence that prolonged distance learning could have long-term effects on schoolchildren and their families, including higher dropout rates and lower income in later years. Parents and caretakers have suffered, too, as homebound schooling has caused many to alter their work lives, disproportionately affecting women, minorities and the underprivileged.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/san-francisco-schools-covid.html

In private, however, nearly everyone does produce a biological sample every day that is then voluntarily sent to a central location to be processed — when they flush the toilet. And fecal waste carries with it a great deal of information about the people who generated it. “If you want to really understand what’s going on in a city on a basic chemical, biological level, you should be looking at the wastewater,” says Eric Alm, a co-director of the Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics at M.I.T. and the scientific director of Biobot Analytics, a company that collects health data from sewage.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/magazine/coronavirus-sewage.html

The researchers recruited non-Roma subjects and, after evaluating their bias against the Roma, had them walk silently around a large lecture hall alongside a Roma person; they did this for three minutes either in sync, matching footfalls or without any coordination. The subjects who synced their strides with a Roma reported less prejudice and stereotyping toward both their walking partner and the Roma as a group. “You tend to like people more and become more prosocial if you engage in synchronous behavior with them,” Sebanz says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/magazine/how-to-get-in-sync-with-someone.html

2020-11-24,"‘The Last American Aristocrat: The Brilliant Life and Improbable Education of Henry Adams,’ by David S. Brown: An Excerpt","In the Education’s double-edged opening pages, Adams recalls a golden nativity: “Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than he.” From there, the narrative, interested in the price of privilege, moves on to an involved, ironic discussion surveying the special burdens of belonging to a pedigree of presidents. Henry knew well each hurdle before him. Raised, as he put it, in the long shadows cast by “the First Church, the Boston State House, Beacon Hill, John Hancock and John Adams,” he internalized past glories, old prejudices, and dying traditions. This demanding ancestor worship, as stifling as a posh sarcophagus, led eventually to a self-imposed Washington exile where, in the nation’s capital city, he produced a vast nine-volume history of the early American republic, in whose final book he dedicated an epitaphic chapter to the “decline of Massachusetts.” An efficient autopsy of the Bay State’s imminent eclipse before the combined might of the slaveholding South and the democratic West, it might be said to have served as spadework for the one puzzling question never far from his thoughts: How did the prized child, the holder of so many “better cards,” come to lose the hand?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/books/review/the-last-american-aristocrat-the-brilliant-life-and-improbable-education-of-henry-adams-by-david-s-brown-an-excerpt.html

I was restless, believing I should have convinced him to see a doctor sooner. When I pulled a cloth along the closet shelf, a shower of mint Lifesavers rained down, left behind from my father’s last visit. An ex-smoker, he always kept his mouth busy. I unwrapped one, placing it, Communion-like, on my tongue. I wasn’t able to save my father’s life; the lung cancer was a wildfire. But as the Lifesaver dissolved, it cleansed me. — Julia Bruce",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-we-could-only-see-each-others-eyes.html

Its roster of corporate clients — start-ups that offered free lunches, salespeople with round-table breakfasts — had all implemented work-from-home policies. Events and conferences were canceled for the foreseeable future. If Jessie Gould, the Ox Verte chief executive, hoped to keep her staff employed and her vendors paid, the only path through the pandemic, it seemed, was going to be retail sales. Instead of catering to offices, they would make deliveries to homes. In addition to ready-to-eat meals, they would sell grocery boxes that appealed to health-conscious consumers newly wanting (or forced) to cook. Ox Verte already had a website, but it wasn’t particularly well suited to taking individual orders, so to enable the pivot, the company put up a new online storefront using Shopify, an e-commerce platform based in Canada.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/magazine/shopify.html

Knowledge of the gatherings spread largely by word of mouth, and MacTavish Best, 46, sent invitations freely. “They were eclectic, not exclusive, events,” she says. At the end of the cocktail hour, she’d ring a bell or tap a sterling silver goblet with a piece of cutlery to let the guests know they should fill their plates — set on the 18th-century Georgian oak dining table would be an array of dishes, cooked by MacTavish Best herself, such as quail lollipops with quince, rum and honey roasted cayenne-cumin carrots and cauliflower and Taleggio baked pasta — and find a spot among the upholstered 17th-century benches, contemporary walnut and ash stools or various throw pillows and trunks spread atop an assortment of antique rugs in the living room. She’d then interview a chosen guest, perhaps an athlete, scientist, actor or C.E.O., about their profession, life and beliefs.

The technique then made its way, albeit in less elaborate form, to America and Britain, where people began pressing and even scrapbooking botanicals they’d collect at home or on holiday.

2020-11-26,Words of Gratitude From Utah,"These past months, I’ve seen something unusual: crowds in the canyons. The pandemic has forced people out of gyms and into our mountains and parks. It’s made our wild spaces more multiracial; I now get stopped regularly by Latinx and Pacific Islander families asking about the nearest trailhead. Children cluster on trails to exclaim over a tarantula or a coyote whisking into the brush. An influx of red squirrels has swelled the raptor population in Salt Lake, and now strangers collect at sunset to bird watch. We think of nature as escape, but now it’s a safe place to be together. Our mountains have become a respite from our solitude, and for that, I am grateful.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/words-of-gratitude-from-utah.html

That is what James Holland, a seasoned craftsman, offers in SICILY ’43: The First Assault on Fortress Europe (Atlantic Monthly Press, $30). He doesn’t wade into gender issues, “periodization,” patriarchism or other currently fashionable matters. Rather, he simply gives us a history of Anglo-Saxon males slaughtering one another while Italians mainly try to get out of the way. Academic historians like to call a certain optimistic type of approach “Whig history.” By contrast, I’d call Holland’s book “Tory history” — and mean it mainly as a compliment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/books/review/james-holland-sicily-43-donald-johnson-occupied-america.html

There are power outages throughout Maine and the crews have to wait until the wind dies down. Around 9 p.m. we hear the bucket truck pulling up. Two men, one just starting out, the other a veteran, get out, turn their head lamps on and work in the dark, lifting the line and reattaching it. We thank them, these men doing their jobs.

A statewide mask mandate, in place since July, helped further slow the spread of Covid-19.

In a nod to Kim’s childhood nickname, Tokki, which is Korean for “bunny,” rabbit-shaped egg dishes often turned up on her plate and, she says, “My lunchboxes would always have fruit and vegetables cut up like animals inside.” Clearly, Kim’s mother already knew that her daughter was a visual person.

Since the ’60s, when their careers began, each has, as Hanya Yanagihara writes in her Editor’s Letter, become “synonymous with an iconic American musical style: the Broadway show tune (Streisand), country (Parton) and soul (LaBelle),” bringing us infinite delight through their “music, acting and sheer force of personality.” Below, we’ve rounded up clips of each artist’s most treasured performances — or most memorable moments — that, when presented altogether, showcase their range, their brilliance and the indelible mark they’ve made on the culture.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/t-magazine/barbra-streisand-patti-labelle-dolly-parton-performances.html

2020-11-30,The Grit and Glory of Dolly Parton,"IN JUNE OF 1967, Dolly Parton sat down for an interview with a Nashville writer named Everett Corbin. Parton was 21, and had yet to release her first solo album, but the surviving audio recording reveals that she was already shaping her account of herself with the editorial finesse of a one-woman P.R. firm: “I was born — we’ll start with when I was born, OK? — I was born on January the 19th, in 1946, in Sevier County, in Sevierville, Tenn. It’s a little town between Knoxville, Tenn., and Gatlinburg, Tenn. And you might shorten it by saying, ‘the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains.’” Parton dutifully answers Corbin’s questions (telling him she most enjoys writing and singing “real strong, pitiful, sad, crying ballads”), before steering the conversation toward a topic he hasn’t asked about, but should have: “Well, I have a new album out, I didn’t mention — or it’s not out, but … it should be out by the end of this month. But it’s called ‘Hello, I’m Dolly.’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/t-magazine/dolly-parton.html

2020-11-30,"Patti LaBelle, the Doyenne of Philadelphia Soul","PATTI LABELLE’S superpower is a spellbinding scream — a refined shriek, really — that makes hairs stand at attention, bones shiver and spines twist. It was 1975 when I first heard it. I was 10, in my parents’ South Bronx tenement, where the radio station WBLS — offering “the total Black experience in sound,” as the promos said — was always on during our morning rush to school. That’s when it hit me — “Creole Lady Marmalaaaaade,” the last word of those titular lyrics, which debuted the year before, filling the air. My first Patti LaBelle moment. There have been many such moments since — like hearing “Love, Need and Want You” (1983), which I put on the very first slow-jam tape I made as a teen — and with each one, the only logical reaction is to throw up your hands, kick off your shoes and, on occasion, break out in a praise dance.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/t-magazine/patti-labelle-philadelphia-soul.html
