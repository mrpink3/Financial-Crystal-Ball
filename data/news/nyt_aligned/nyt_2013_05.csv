Seafood is an obvious choice, but there is a long list of cheeses that would work well. Satiny, funky Torta del Casar and rich Mahón come to mind, though there are many other options from beyond Spain. Perhaps cheese with asparagus; these wines, with their persistent citric notes and occasional herbal allure, easily tame that springtime wine challenger. I chose asparagus barely cooked, to dress pasta in pastel green. I kept the tips whole and used the stems to make a finely ground pestolike mixture with garlic, olive oil and cheese, this time Grana Padano.

The effort builds, to a large extent, on studies aiming to create a “carbon budget” for the world’s nations — divvying up the amount of emissions (and thus fuels) below that threshold. The most notable paper, published in Nature, was “Greenhouse-Gas Emission Targets for Limiting Global Warming to 2 °C.” (2 °C being 2 degrees Celsius).

To his credit, Rohde, a columnist for Reuters and The Atlantic, barely tries.

2013-05-03,Significant Others,"Reading the title of Claire Messud’s latest novel, anyone of a literary turn of mind will immediately think of the madwoman in the attic, the 19th century’s best-known “woman upstairs.” In “Jane Eyre,” Bertha Mason was the first wife of the master of Thornfield Hall, who shut her away and, in so doing, opened the door to more than a hundred years of impassioned feminist criticism. This connection is entirely intentional, as Messud quickly makes plain. “We’re not the madwomen in the attic,” argues her “reliable,” “organized” protagonist, a teacher named Nora Eldridge, referring to unmarried women like herself, “numerous” in their 20s and 30s, “positively legion” in their 40s and 50s. “We’re the quiet woman at the end of the third-floor hallway, whose trash is always tidy, who smiles brightly in the stairwell.” Outwardly they may seem “benignant” (to use a Brontëan word), but inwardly, Nora declares, they seethe. “People don’t want to worry about the Woman Upstairs,” she reflects. “Not a soul registers that we are furious. We’re completely invisible.” In time, she will resolve to “use that invisibility, to make it burn.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/books/review/the-woman-upstairs-by-claire-messud.html

Or ownership of a life and its accompanying body: these tales allow the body to adjust as needed.

We use them in place of statistics as tools.” Reading Peter Dimock’s second novel, “George Anderson: Notes for a Love Song in Imperial Time,” didn’t automatically make me a better person — but it did make me aware that, as an American, I should try to be one, even if my attempts are probably doomed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/books/review/george-anderson-by-peter-dimock.html

No haloed guardians, these: they want nothing less than dominion over mankind. Set against them are the angelologists, a secret global group dedicated to thwarting the Nephilim’s unholy ambitions. Readers flocked to Trussoni’s first novel (she’s also the author of a 2006 memoir, “Falling Through the Earth”) for its mix of fantasy and religious conspiracy, as well as for the improbable romance between its characters: the art historian Verlaine and Evangeline, an innocent young nun.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/books/review/angelopolis-by-danielle-trussoni.html

Severe and chronic shortages can of course wear people down. But just as the development of a sound immune system requires exposure to lots of microbes, sound mental health seems to require the challenges presented by moderate amounts of privation.

In “Of Botticelli,” a site-specific mural that fills an entire wall of the gallery, ceramic fragments represent columns wrapped in vines and crowned by vases, hinting at an unseen garden view. Other pieces, which combine ceramics with painting on canvas, hang on the walls and are framed to look like windows. Still others sit on the floor like carpets. And in “Wallpaper,” Woodman recycles 90 cast-off bits of clay — pieces cut away during the making of her ceramics — by glazing them and arranging them on a wall, where they will be free to visitors for the taking.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/on-view-betty-woodman/

It’s a deceptively simple trick, a way of foregrounding what would ordinarily be background. The purity of the final image belies the incredibly complicated rigging that makes it possible — a process that usually involves industrial cranes, ropes and numerous artisans. Lee, 37, retouches the photographs to erase any trace of his own hand. “If the mechanics of the artwork were visible, it would be easier for people to recognize the scale and the method,” he said. “But I want to hide them, to infuse a magical and vague aspect to my work, so that viewers may question and try to find answers themselves.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/treescapes/

Confession time: “Love and Rockets” is beloved by many, but the parts of the sprawling tale that I’ve read have left me cold. “Marble Season” had the opposite effect. In this semi-autobiographical tale, Mr. Hernandez captures the wonder of childhood — the joy of imagination, an appreciation for comic books and all the ultimately petty but seemingly world-shattering trials and tribulations of friendships during that time in one’s life. The 120-page story is told in six-panel grids that reminded me of Sunday newspaper comic strips, which I devoured in my youth. “Marble Season” is published by Drawn & Quarterly.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/graphic-books-best-sellers-the-wonder-of-childhood/

2013-05-06,What’s on Saturday,"9 P.M. (Showtime) SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN (2012) The director Lasse Hallstrom transforms Paul Torday’s absurdist political satire — the tale of a visionary sheik (Amr Waked, above left, with Ewan McGregor) with unlimited financial resources intent on creating a recreational paradise for fishermen in a Middle Eastern desert — into a whimsical romantic comedy. Mr. Hallstrom “is a shrewd commercial alchemist with a soft heart,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, and the result “is the cinematic equivalent of turning salt into sugar.” Mr. McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a British fisheries expert who is approached to evaluate the feasibility of the concept, which would involve either importing 10,000 North Atlantic salmon to Yemen from Britain, or using farmed salmon. Kristin Scott Thomas is Patricia Maxwell, the press secretary for the British prime minister, who seizes on the opportunity to distract the public from political conflicts and score points for her boss. And Emily Blunt is Harriet, the sheik’s assistant, and the unspoken object of Fred’s affection, whose soldier boyfriend (Tom Mison) has gone missing in action. “Whether Harriet and Fred will get together is a question that hovers over the movie,” Mr. Holden said. “The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt, whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the story’s emotional center.” And although the sheik is the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, “the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with international politics or terrorism,” Mr. Holden said. “It comes when those farmed salmon are finally released into the waters of their new home. Will they mill around in confusion or will they jump? It is enough to say that for this moment to be the film’s dramatic turning point is an indication of its softness.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html
2013-05-06,IHT Quick Read: May 4,"NEWS Even as the United States economy displays unanticipated resilience, with a healthy jobs report released on Friday, the outlook for Europe’s economy grows ever dimmer. As it does, the pressure builds on Europe’s most powerful leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and her economic team to find a way to get the Continent growing again. But this puts Ms. Merkel in a bind, as she has to answer to German voters in September when the country holds parliamentary elections. While the European economy may be deteriorating at an alarming rate, the electorate here is still enamored of her as the Iron Chancellor, advocating the austerity policies that are rapidly falling into disfavor elsewhere, among economists as well as the public.

2013-05-07,Sweet and Spicy or Assertive Wines With Eggplant,"Eggplant is often described as a polarizing food, one that people either love or hate. I’m the counterexample. I like it well enough, unless it’s overcooked, which emphasizes the mushy texture and slight bitterness that seem to repel so many. That tendency toward bitterness, especially when combined with the spinach in Mary McCartney’s dish of eggplant wraps, makes it a difficult pairing. I think of reds first, but nothing too tannic, which would clash with the bitterness. The sweet and spicy fruit of a lighter-weight zinfandel would work well. So might a lively Sicilian red like a nero d’Avola or a cerasuolo di Vittoria. Assertive whites would work well, too, like a sauvignon blanc, even a flamboyantly styled example, or a good, dry chenin blanc, like a Vouvray or Savennières.",Style,https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/sweet-and-spicy-or-assertive-wines-with-eggplant/

Even though dad lived south of us in the upper Hudson Valley, my husband Jim and I assumed he was just embellishing, and we’d smirk to each other. He was always positive and optimistic, whether gardening, dealing with three different cancer episodes or rooting for Philadelphia sports teams. I finally grew enough garlic from his stock to completely replace my varieties. And yes, it is quick to emerge in the spring, gaining good height early. This year’s is already up.

When Hearst met the young New York designer Hassan Pierre — whose Way It Should Be and Basic collections use materials ranging from organic cotton jersey to discarded cassette tape — the two discovered a shared wish to create a retail platform for the movement’s best offerings.

Zanuck (1934-2012), the Oscar-winning producer, through recollections of his childhood on the 20th Century Fox lot as the son of the studio head Darryl F. Zanuck and his wife, the actress Virginia Fox. When Richard had the chance to produce his first film, “Compulsion,” starring Orson Welles, he said his father told him: “You know I had it a lot easier than you will have it. You have to overcome the circumstances of your birth. You carry baggage with you — I am the baggage you carry.” When Darryl Zanuck was installed as chairman of the studio in the 1960s, he asked his son for a list of possible names to be appointed president of the company. Richard, above, submitted a piece of paper that read, simply, “Me.” Films like “The Sound of Music” (1965), “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969), “M*A*S*H” (1970) and “The French Connection” (1971) followed. But films like “Doctor Dolittle” (1967) and “Hello, Dolly” (1969) resulted in debt, and just before Christmas 1970, Richard was fired by his father. Shortly afterward his father also lost his job. This documentary, with Steven Spielberg as an executive producer, is followed at 9:45 by “Driving Miss Daisy” (1989), the Oscar best picture winner starring Jessica Tandy as a Southern widow and Morgan Freeman as her driver; it was the first movie produced by the Zanuck Company, which Richard and his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, founded in 1988. “Cocoon” (1985), about a group of elderly people rejuvenated by aliens, follows at 1:15 a.m., and “Compulsion” (1959), Richard Fleischer’s take on the Leopold-Loeb case, at 3:30.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Jurors, who reached their verdict after roughly three days of deliberations in Phoenix, will next decide whether Ms. Arias, 32, receives the death penalty.

Born in Manchester, England, in 1928, he began his career as a journalist when he was only 16, rising rapidly through the years and accumulating honors as he went. He was the editor of The Sunday Times of London from 1967 to 1981, moved to the United States in 1984 and became — to mention only a few of his positions — editorial director of U.S. News and World Report, president of Random House and founding editor of Condé Nast Traveler.

Some parts of the international community weren’t listening at all. America was serene in its isolation and prosperity. “To the world, or to a nation,” The Grand Forks Herald in North Dakota declared, “an archduke more or less makes little difference.” President Wilson, pacing the lonely corridors of the White House, was distraught over the first lady’s failing struggle for life.

More often than not, when I try to nudge wary customers gently toward gin (instead of, you know, vodka), they look at me as if I’ve offered them a live grenade. This bad rap, I think, is partly the fault of the English artist William Hogarth. The gin of 18th-century England — harsh and cheap — is very different from what we drink now, but anyone who was shown a slide of Hogarth’s “Gin Lane” in history class is unlikely to forget the images of those dissolute Londoners: here, a man fighting a dog for a bone; there, a woman dropping her baby over a railing.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/magazine/gin-doesnt-make-you-sad.html

Later, without giving specifics, I consulted our hospital lawyer, who told me that we were under no obligation to report the incident, because the patient wasn’t in danger of hurting himself or others. But the future of an innocent man hinges on two people’s consciences, my patient’s and my own. I feel like a coward, hiding behind the Hippocratic oath, doing nothing.

2013-05-10,Who Made That Digital Camouflage?,"“I was basically designated the weird-projects officer,” says Timothy O’Neill, who worked with an Army team to improve the camouflage painted on tanks in the early 1970s. At the time, the military covered its vehicles with suitcase-size splotches of green and brown. The pattern could trick the eye at a distance, but it didn’t work well at close range. O’Neill set out to find a better solution. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a test site in Maryland, he and his team put an armored personnel carrier out in a field and painted it with two-inch squares in woodland colors. From far away, the flecks seemed to coalesce into a large pattern, so that the vehicle blended with the trees behind it. The tiny squares also mimicked close-up details: individual leaves, tufts of grass and shadows on a branch. O’Neill’s tests showed that this digital camouflage — as it would later be called — fooled the eye into seeing tank and landscape as one.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/magazine/who-made-that-digital-camouflage.html

As mind-blowingly wonderful as it is to now carry 25,000 songs in my pocket, the Walkman forced a deeper engagement with the music you loved. Nobody carried around lots of cassettes. Maybe one or two extra. And if you were like me, you often kept the same one in there for weeks at a time, creating an intimacy that seems quaint now. Fast-forwarding and rewinding were a drag, so you tended to listen through entire albums, sometimes falling in love with songs you hated on first listen. This was commitment. The melodies and lyrics on these albums in particular — “Hatful of Hollow,” by the Smiths; “Murmur,” by R.E.M.; “Let It Be,” by the Replacements; “Head on the Door,” by the Cure; and “Architecture & Morality,” by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark — are practically etched on the inside of my skull.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/the-omg-who-is-o-m-d-playlist/

2013-05-10,Eternal Flame,"“Are you or are you not a good girl?” Edna O’Brien’s mother wants to know. The options are telling; they imply a less-than-even division of territory. Imagine a small saintly island, surrounded by a raging, pagan sea of non-goodness, mortal sin and diabolical decadence. The miniature haven is, of course, Ireland. And at the time Lena O’Brien poses the question, in the early hours of the morning, from the bed in which she has listened for her delinquent daughter’s footsteps, Edna O’Brien has fled the country, at least physically.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/country-girl-a-memoir-by-edna-obrien.html

Jennifer Margulis sees a vast conspiracy too, only its purpose is to make you miserable, sick and quite possibly dead, especially if you are a pregnant woman or a new mother.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/the-business-of-baby-by-jennifer-margulis.html
2013-05-10,Planet Waves,"Set in the scorching heat of the Egyptian desert at the end of the 19th century, Ken Kalfus’s new novel follows a fictional British astronomer’s attempt to make contact with Mars. Hundreds of thousands of men are digging the gigantic equilateral triangle with which Sanford Thayer intends to send a signal to his fellow astronomers on the red planet. Once finished, each side will consist of a paved trench more than 300 miles long and exactly one seventy-third of Earth’s circumference. The trenches, five miles wide, are deep enough to be filled with a 12-inch layer of petroleum that will flow from 309 taps connected to a pipeline. The huge black triangle set against the white desert sand will prove the existence of terrestrial intelligence to the Martians, Thayer argues, because the equal-sided triangle is part of the two planets’ “shared knowledge of trigonometry.” The equilateral triangle is, he believes, the “basis for all human art and construction.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/equilateral-by-ken-kalfus.html

2013-05-10,The Postcolonial,"Albert Camus was that rare writer who enjoyed a celebrity usually reserved for rock stars, even while being taken very seriously as an artist and a public intellectual. His first novel, “The Stranger,” published in 1942 when he was 29, made him famous; after that came more novels, plays, lyrical essays, short stories, two major philosophical works (“The Myth of Sisyphus” and “The Rebel”), and countless newspaper articles, editorials and political commentaries. In 1957, at age 44, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second-youngest writer ever to receive the prize (after Rud­yard Kipling). Less than three years later, in January 1960, he was killed in a car crash; people the world over mourned.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/algerian-chronicles-by-albert-camus.html
2013-05-10,Spectral Souls,"Over the past century, the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov (1831-95) has been repeatedly rediscovered. As Richard Pevear points out in the introduction to “The Enchanted Wanderer” — a collection of 17 stories vibrantly translated by Pevear and Larissa ­Volokhonsky — this has happened at least three times. The first rediscovery took place during Leskov’s own lifetime: in the 1880s, after he had suffered for years “an almost total critical neglect,”the young Chekhov hailed his oeuvre, declaring him “a mixture of an elegant Frenchman and a defrocked priest.” Leskov, Chekhov continued, “was considerable.”In the 1920s, the formalist critic Boris Eikhenbaum discerned Leskov’s influence in the work of such diverse writers as Andrei Bely, Isaac Babel and Maxim Gorky, who frankly “declared himself Leskov’s disciple.”And again, at the hands of critics like Walter Benjamin and Irving Howe, Leskov was the subject of yet another revival. “To go back to certain earlier writers is to regain a sense of human possibility,” Howe wrote. “To go back to Leskov is to regain a sense of the passion, sometimes the joy, that can be part of the human enterprise.” Now, thanks to this delicious new collection, the time is once again ripe for Leskov’s resurgence.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/nikolai-leskovs-enchanted-wanderer-and-other-stories.html

But the “manly voice” with “pipes and whistles in his sound,” as Shakespeare put it, reverberates in its own distinctive fashion in the retirement home setting of McCorkle’s new novel, where the yoga class finds “a whole roomful of old folks breathing deeply and chanting — one sounding like a sewing machine and another a squirrel.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/life-after-life-by-jill-mccorkle.html

Although neither conservative nor a Republican, I had libertarian leanings and appreciated the society’s openness to debating its political opponents. I felt slightly illicit in crossing ideological lines: once, when the dean spotted me leaving a meeting, I felt as if I’d been caught walking out of an X-rated movie. But the discussions themselves were always intellectually engaging, and my fellow law students seemed more interested in converging around a shared approach to interpreting the Constitution than in squabbling about partisan differences.

For years, the three best friends have played a continuous, ever evolving game of make-believe embracing fictional kingdoms, characters and allegiances, using toy figurines and hastily assembled objects to stand in for the real thing.

2013-05-10,Tables Inspired by African Stools,"Though they’ve been in business for five years, the product designers behind Grain, a firm based on Bainbridge Island off the Seattle coast, have only just gotten around to doing furniture. Before this, the team — Chelsea Green, 32, and James Minola, 30 — designed what they call “personal accessories,” like a recyclable shower curtain and a hand mirror. At the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, May 18to 21 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, they plan to introduce two versions of their Dish table (one is a side table, the other a coffee table).

The outdoor exhibition is a tribute to two early 20th-century design phenomena: a smoking room in Vienna, designed by the secessionist production cooperative Wiener Werkstätte, and color-charted gardens, a bygone fad for mapping flowers by shade to create a plot that feels almost like a Pantone chart. Loboda potted groups of different plants in an arrangement that mimics the floor plan of the smoking room. “The idea is to take the domestic situation, an interior, and to translate it into something wild, into a landscape,” she said.

2013-05-13,Editor’s Letter | Away We Go,"Travel journalism often falls into one of two camps — the highly didactic and servicey piece, “go here, stay there, see that,” or the long-winded narrative in which the writer has the experience and we are meant to be satisfied by the first-person blow-by-blow he or she has brought back for us: “the road into town was dusty and unpaved and the driver kept getting lost.” The former is best served up by the Internet on demand. (You can find all of our hotel and restaurant suggestions for the stories in this issue at tmagazine.com.) And the pure version of the latter is perhaps best left to brilliant writers who promise to reward you for coming along (Edith Wharton, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Evelyn Waugh, Jan Morris). There are of course also intellectual and cultural histories of locales, in which the writer seeks to tease out the influences — historical, economic, social, stylistic, culinary and political — that make the place uniquely what it is (V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski). The type we favor at T is a hybrid of the three, in which great writing and personal narrative is done in the service of not just traipsing along with the writer who got to go on an amazing journey that we didn’t, but of bringing you back a new understanding of a place that is enlightening and satisfying regardless of whether you ever plan to visit.

2013-05-13,Britain: Cleric May Head to Jordan," After years of battling in Britain’s courts to avoid deportation to Jordan and a retrial there on terrorist bombing charges, a militant Islamist preacher of Palestinian descent known as Abu Qatada told an immigration court through his lawyer on Friday that he will fly home voluntarily if Britain and Jordan ratify a treaty concluded last month that will ensure that no evidence obtained by torture will be used in the case. The two countries have said they expect the ratification process to be completed within months. The 52-year-old cleric, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment on the bombing charges by a Jordanian court in 1990. In Britain, where he sought refugee status, he has become a symbol for many in Britain of the exploitation of the country’s immigration, welfare and justice systems by migrants seeking to use Britain as a haven for terrorist activities. Mr. Othman’s new pledge was met with widespread skepticism, with some legal experts saying he might be seeking to pre-empt a move favored by some in the government who have urged that Mr. Othman, currently held in prison for breaking bail conditions forbidding his use of cellphones and computers, be flown back to Jordan peremptorily, in defiance of British and European court rulings in his favor.

By Friday morning, the number had pushed above 1,000. And then, late in the afternoon, a soldier from the Bangladeshi Army, standing atop the rubble of the wrecked building, noticed an iron rod that seemed to be moving. There was a noise, a voice. Rescuers hurriedly carved a hole through a concrete pillar. Television stations in Bangladesh cut to the scene: a woman, gasping, was alive in the wreckage, nearly 17 full days after Rana Plaza had collapsed. A new number was announced: One. A female garment worker named Reshma. A survivor. A miracle. “Save me!” rescuers heard her shout, before they pulled her into the afternoon light, her face powdered in dust as she was placed on a stretcher.

2013-05-13,What’s on Sunday,"10:30 P.M. (HBO) FAMILY TREE In this new, largely improvised series from Christopher Guest and Jim Piddock, Chris O’Dowd plays the down-on-his-luck Tom Chadwick, a 30-year-old Briton grappling with his identity since losing his girlfriend and his job. But when his Great-Aunt Victoria bequeaths him a chest of curios, he starts investigating his lineage to understand better who he and his unconventional family actually are. The ventriloquist Nina Conti plays his sister, Bea, who speaks through a monkey hand puppet; Michael McKean, above right, with Mr. O’Dowd, is their father. In this premiere episode, Tom finds a black-and-white portrait thought to be of his great-grandfather Harry and tracks down Neville St. Aubrey (Christopher Fairbank), an oddball antique photography expert. Tom’s best friend, Pete (Tom Bennett), meanwhile, fixes him up with a model. But what kind, exactly, no one is sure. “There is a familiarity to the series,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “As in Mr. Guest’s films, its story is less important than the presentation of a gallery of eccentrics, ranging from mildly odd to completely loony.” One result, Mr. Hale said, is that the series “can feel a little loose and inconsequential” as Tom “unearths one dotty, inglorious relative after another.” But “that also means that we get to spend more time with Mr. Guest’s crack cast of improvisers,” he added, “and there are moments in each half-hour that pay off.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

One of her first discoveries was aburatorigami, the traditional handmade blotting papers used in ancient Japan to protect gold as it is hammered into delicate gold leaf. Several centuries ago, geisha realized that the papers could also absorb facial oil, without disturbing their signature stage makeup. “I tried to do exactly what the geisha were doing, but also make products that are a little bit easier to use,” Tsai said. “And they use our stuff now.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/t-magazine/tatcha-skincare.html

2013-05-13,What’s on Monday,"10 P.M. (13) THE INVISIBLE WAR (2012) The Department of Defense estimates that there were 22,800 sexual assaults in the United States military in 2011. Veterans Affairs studies have shown that one-third of women seeking assistance have been sexually assaulted, and that more men than women are assaulted while in service. This Academy Award nominee for best documentary feature, directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering, uses interviews with retired and active service members to investigate the epidemic of rape within the military. (A female soldier in a combat zone is more likely to be attacked by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire.) “Military service is often a family tradition, and the military itself, with its customs of loyalty, solidarity and shared sacrifice, can be a kind of family for its members,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “This means that the violations chronicled in ‘The Invisible War’ are compounded by a deep and terrible betrayal, which ripples outward from the various branches of the service into the society as a whole. This is not a movie that can be ignored.” (Above Kori Cioca, who served in the Coast Guard, and her husband, Rob.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

The suit, filed in both state and federal courts, was brought on behalf of the child’s adoptive parents and is intended to restrict the practice of medically unnecessary sex assignment surgeries on infants, said lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The child was in the care of the South Carolina Department of Social Services when doctors, in cooperation with social services employees, removed the child’s male genitals. The child, now 8, identifies himself as a boy, according to his parents, Mark and Pam Crawford of Richland County. “They disfigured him because they could not accept him for who he was,” Mrs. Crawford said in a statement, “not because he needed any surgery.” Increasingly, doctors and those who were born with a condition once called hermaphroditism recommend that children be assigned a gender at birth but postpone surgery until they are old enough to choose.

Jonathan Chait, in particular, has taken to explaining why “the growing mass of evidence that the health-care-cost inflation problem is indeed solvable” cuts the legs out from under the entire right-of-center take on health care, deficits and entitlements, and puts the data squarely on the side of health care reform’s proponents.

2013-05-17,36 Hours in Texas Hill Country,"There are two ways to think about the Texas Hill Country. Physically, it spreads across the undulating Edwards Plateau, with Austin to the east and San Antonio to the south. Near the center is Fredericksburg, which was once the main show in these parts, but no longer. To get a feeling for the Hill Country in the second sense — the state of mind where cool mingles with tradition, and industriousness and idleness are equally esteemed values (depending on the time of day) — head out among the limestone knolls full of live oak groves and cypress-lined creeks, and to the gritty pin-dot towns built largely of native stone. Here you’ll find a delicious tension between rural and refined. Inns and restaurants are bringing a clever touch to Lone Star hospitality and mythology, and with the vineyards and boutique farms (lavender, olives), some people make comparisons to Napa Valley or even Provence. But those assessments ignore something fundamental: the Hill Country — being Texas at its finest — is like nowhere else in the world.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/travel/36-hours-in-texas-hill-country.html

2013-05-17,What’s On Friday,"9 P.M. (13) RIGOLETTO Michael Mayer, who won a Tony Award for directing “Spring Awakening,” made his Metropolitan Opera debut with this Verdi work, in a new production known as “the Rat Pack ‘Rigoletto,’ ” which moved events from a decadent 16th-century Italian court to the Las Vegas strip around 1960. The Polish tenor Piotr Beczala is the Duke, here a Sinatra-like playboy whose entourage includes the world-weary comedian Rigoletto, sung by the Serbian baritone Zeljko Lucic. The German soprano Diana Damrau, above with Mr. Lucic, plays the innocent Gilda, Rigoletto’s daughter and the victim of the predatory Duke. The Italian Michele Mariotti leads the ensemble in what Anthony Tommasini, writing in The New York Times, called “an excellent outing for this rising conductor.” Mr. Tommasini also noted that Mr. Mayer “had modeled Rigoletto on aggressive comics like Don Rickles, who could crack up Sinatra.” But “the vagueness of the concept undermines Mr. Lucic’s otherwise affecting performance,” he added, writing “the production was a frustrating mix of inventive and half-baked thinking.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

Although the show features solo designs by each (wooden tortoises and lily-pad tables by Kiss, and tree-mushroom-shaped wall shelves by Lehrecke, to name a few), their joint efforts include a series of pieces in white oak designed by Lehrecke with cast-bronze pulls (also mushroom-shaped) by Kiss.

After a brief and not especially rigorous courtship, she agrees to become his wife. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, this psychologically fragile young woman — whose emotional and sexual frigidity is strongly signposted right from the start — seems trapped and unhappy, resisting her husband’s apparently good-hearted attempts to make her feel loved and secure. Meanwhile, across town, her sister, Iris — equally beautiful and blond, but with a disheveled, bohemian promiscuity and a deliciously described aptitude for “being not withholding with the cleavage” — is engaged in an affair with a man who plays the piano in the bar of a shabby hotel. When Constance is introduced to this married “lush” from Miami, his very presence so unsettles and (she imagines) repulses her, that she persuades him to break off his affair with Iris.

Like hunger or fatigue, their loneliness comes and goes and isn’t defining: talk to them for an hour and they forget it. Chronics, though, are another story.

Hemingway changed the look and sound of American speech on the printed page. But how did he get so much work done, the stories, the novels, the nonfiction (not to mention the thousands of letters he wrote), amid all that wasteful boozing and boasting, the depressions, the freakish accidents, the bouts of soaring blood pressure, the stark-awake and Seconal-stoked nights?

2013-05-17,Inside the List," DUCK SEASON: Phil Robertson, the backwoods Louisiana patriarch and hunting entrepreneur who stars on the A&E reality show “Duck Dynasty,” rules the hardcover nonfiction list this week — his memoir, “Happy, Happy, Happy” (written with Mark Schlabach), is new at No. 1. It’s not the first best seller the show has spawned, either: “The Duck Commander Family,” by Phil’s son Willie and daughter-in-law Korie (with Schlabach again), is at No. 7 in its sixth week, riding the coattails of a season finale that drew 9.6 million viewers last month. “Happy, Happy, Happy” takes its title from Robertson’s catchphrase, and presents itself as a rustic guide to the good life — one chapter, “Redneck Caviar,” declares that “Rule No. 11 for living happy, happy, happy” is to “suck the head of a crawfish (you’ll want to do it again and again).” Part of the Robertsons’ charm is that they seem genuinely well adjusted, like the Waltons’ hairier cousins; every episode ends with a family prayer and a dinner prepared by Phil’s wife, Kay, whom he married when he was 16 and she was 15. “If you can find a nice, pretty country girl who can cook and carries her Bible,” he advises readers, “now, there’s a woman.

Her stepdad is “O.K.,” her younger half-brother is “pretty cool,” her stepsister is a mean girl and a bully; but Linnea loves her mom, and since she can’t remember her feckless, long-lost father, she doesn’t really miss him. Theirs is a typical blended family, so sadly representative that the nightmare that demolishes their relative peace and turns Linnea into an unreachable, volatile teenager is a school shooting — a signature American tragedy. Suffice it to say that the details of that awful day are blood-chilling and unbearable. As survivors go, Linnea is especially unlucky.

A million golden arrows point to Neverland, and you can reach Oz by passing through a gate studded with glittering emeralds. The heft of “Or else!” in cautionary tales about children going up in flames after playing with matches was replaced with the incandescent beauty of “What if?” Writers aspired to lure children into fantasy worlds that would leave them, as Frances Hodgson Burnett put it, “breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/books/review/beautiful-creatures.html

The leftist majorities in both houses of Parliament passed the legislation last month amid mass demonstrations by opponents of same-sex marriage and an acrimonious political debate. Legislators from the right challenged the constitutionality of the law before the high court, the Constitutional Council, but it was widely expected that the legislation would be approved. In its ruling, the Constitutional Council found that the law would not create a “right to a child” for same-sex couples, a contention made by some opponents of the legislation. Those opponents say they fear the new law will open the way to medically assisted procreation for lesbian couples and the use of surrogate mothers, neither of which are legal practices in France.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/world/europe/frances-same-sex-marriage-legislation-ruled-constitutional.html

2013-05-17,"Single Yellow Fever Shot Offers Lifetime Protection, W.H.O. Says","One yellow fever shot confers lifetime protection and the customary “booster shot” given at 10 years is no longer necessary, the World Health Organization announced Friday. Yellow fever vaccine is relatively safe but causes more dangerous side effects than many other vaccines and is therefore normally given only to healthy people who are at risk. The mosquito-borne disease, for which there is no cure, strikes about 200,000 people worldwide each year and kills about 30,000 of them. Cases are increasing as deforestation increases contact with forest mosquitoes and the monkeys that harbor the virus. Only nine cases have been found in the United States over the past 30 years, all in travelers returning from Africa or Latin America, but eight were fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Thomas P. Monath, a yellow fever expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that the W.H.O. announcement made sense for almost all vaccine recipients, but that booster shots might still be needed for laboratory technicians working with the virus and for a few travelers who had one shot many years ago but whose immunity had waned.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/health/single-yellow-fever-shot-offers-lifetime-protection-who-says.html

At DDC, he will show 120 pieces created by the Blenko designers Wayne Husted, Joel Philips Myers and John Nickerson. “Sometimes people aren’t sure how to live with the pieces,” he said, “but when they see them grouped together as a landscape, something clicks and it makes sense.” Prices range from $700 for a 22-inch cylindrical vase by Joel Myers to $5,500 for a 38-inch-tall decanter by Wayne Husted.

2013-05-20,What’s on Saturday,"8 P.M. (Starz) BRAVE (2012) Kelly Macdonald lends her voice to Pixar’s first female protagonist: Merida, above, a Scottish princess and ace archer crowned by a mass of wild and woolly persimmon-hued tendrils and riding a high-stepping Clydesdale, Angus. Her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), wants her to behave more like a lady. The queen has also beckoned local clan leaders to bring their sons by the castle to compete for her daughter’s hand, causing a furious Merida to rebel. When her defiance doesn’t work, she seeks help from a witch (Julie Walters), who casts a spell that sidelines the queen — and eventually prompts Merida to embark on a mission to rescue her mother and, in the process, save her family. Entering “the big business of little girls,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, “hasn’t been easy, to judge by the deep divide between the movie’s seductive pictorial splendor and its discouragingly uninspired script by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi. (Ms. Chapman, the first woman hired to direct a Pixar feature, either left or was removed from “Brave” and now shares directing credit with Mr. Andrews.)” Still, “the animation, particularly in the outdoor scenes, can be transfixing with the photorealist details — every blade of grass and each hair in Angus’s mane looks perfectly individuated — blending seamlessly with the cartoon impressionism,” Ms. Dargis wrote, adding: “The association of Merida with the natural world accounts for some of the movie’s most beautifully animated sequences, and in other, smarter or maybe just braver, hands it might have also inspired new thinking about women, men, nature and culture.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The result was the Inside Out Project, which challenged residents of often perilous and politically unstable environments to generate their own photographic messages — no logos or hate messages allowed — and send them to him. J R then printed giant images of the photographs and returned them to their creators, to be pasted up “in a place with meaning.” This documentary, directed by Alastair Siddons, follows J R as he travels the world to motivate communities to define their most important causes. More than 130,000 people have pasted messages in some 10,000 places in 100 countries, including Brazil, Tunisia, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, France and the United States. The exhibitions are documented at insideoutproject.net.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2013-05-21,What’s On Tuesday,"7 P.M. (HBO) MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) In this storybook tale from Wes Anderson, the 12-year-old Suzy (Kara Hayward) and her soul mate, Sam (Jared Gilman), fall in love and run off, while still on an island, sending the adults in charge — Suzy’s parents (the Bishops, played by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand); Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton, above center); and Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) — into a panic as a violent storm approaches. “Written by Mr. Anderson and Roman Coppola (they worked together several times before), ‘Moonrise Kingdom’ breezes along with a beautifully coordinated admixture of droll humor, deadpan and slapstick,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. But, she added, as in all of Mr. Anderson’s films, “there’s a deep, pervasive melancholia here too, a sense of regret evident in Mr. Bishop’s slouch (with his plaid pants, he is a walking John Cheever tragedy) and in the way Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look, and don’t look, at each other. Adulthood can seem so desperately painful, so maybe Sam and Suzy shouldn’t be quite as eager to grow up.” Still, Ms. Dargis said: “Sam and Suzy, while their story has the charms of a fairy tale and some of its terrors, aren’t playing at love. They are in love, and that is the most real thing in the world.” Mr. Anderson and Mr. Coppola earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

Sebring, a fashion photographer and award-winning filmmaker, used the device to create “Revolution,” a three-year effort on display for three days at the 69th Regiment Armory. The multimedia exhibition pays simultaneous tribute to the 19th-century English photographer Eadweard Muybridge and to Marcel Duchamp, whose abstract classic “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2″ drew inspiration from Muybridge’s pioneering stop-motion imagery. The device contains 100 synchronized cameras that shoot in predetermined sequences, allowing Sebring to capture form and movement from numerous perspectives simultaneously — for example, his muse, Coco Rocha, spinning and dancing (as seen in “Discovery,” the first clip above). He can then present the results in numerous forms, including film, photographs and sculpture.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/on-view-steven-sebrings-fourth-dimensional-perspective/

Five years after meeting over frozen drinks at a barbecue and ending up in bed, they decide to abandon their respective governments and go to work on opposite sides of the beauty products industry, with puffed-up executives portrayed by Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson. “It’s a caper movie, a love story,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film, written and directed by Tony Gilroy, “an extra-dry corporate satire. However you describe it, ‘Duplicity’ is superior entertainment, the most elegantly pleasurable movie of its kind to come around in a very long time.” At 9:30 in “Notting Hill” (1999) he (Hugh Grant this time) is a bashful London bookstore owner who’s not quite sure he’s ready to reopen his wounded heart for business. She (Ms. Roberts again) is a Hollywood diva — but also, as she says, “just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.” You know the rest. “The movie has lots of glossy charm,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, “even if Ms. Roberts and Mr. Grant seem less like lovers than members of a support group for the desperately attractive.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

But he can afford it — the cost of school for each child at Bridge, including books and materials, is the equivalent of $5.16 a month.

Then, this fall, he will dismantle a deconsecrated 19th-century Italian church and rebuild it at MoMA PS1 in Queens. Vezzoli finishes up at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, with a show focusing fittingly on his obsession with all things cinematic. Asked if, at 41, a global retrospective might be premature, Vezzoli says, “I see this project more like a parody of a Cher farewell tour, a silly movie launch or a Fitzcarraldo experience — something extravagant and certainly not celebratory, at least in my intentions.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/idol-worship/

Players will risk injury on bumpy pitches, most of the games will be as competitive as a dust-up between Anderson Silva and Justin Bieber, and the resulting fixture squeeze will mean that there will be no time to accommodate FIFA international dates, so clubs will play a host of league fixtures without their star players, who’ll be away on international duty.

Often overshadowed by Hoffmann, Moser is finally getting his first American museum exhibition: “Koloman Moser: Designing Modern Vienna 1897-1907,” which opens today at the Neue Galerie New York and runs through Sept. 2. The show, which was organized in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (where it will be on view later this year), presents more than 200 examples of Moser’s prodigious output in an installation designed by the Chicago architect John Vinci to evoke the notion of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art, an ideal of the Vienna Secession. For those who can’t resist the temptation to take home a souvenir, the Neue Galerie’s shop is selling objects like the tea service shown here (priced à la carte from $50 to $225), a reproduction of a 1901-2 design by Moser, with circle-pattern decoration by Jutta Sika, one of his students.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/on-view-koloman-mosers-viennese-vision/

The piece’s author, Tony Dokoupil, actually goes a little bit further than I would: Given how much of suicide’s new statistical prominence is explained by the (happy) decline in other ways of death, and given that suicide rates were dipping in the U.S. up until the turn of millenium, I’m not sure that the language of “epidemic” quite makes sense at this point; I think the Center for Disease Control’s formulation, “an increasing public health concern,” is a more appropriate way of putting it. The big question, as my column tried to suggest, is where the current trend is going, and whether the upward movement is likely to persist. And here the Newsweek essay has a good distillation of the case for pessimism:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/the-trajectory-of-suicide/

The reader can hardly help noticing that while Sischy is the titular girl, she is not much in evidence in the piece itself, which is largely a portrait gallery of various art-world blowhards and monomaniacs. Malcolm admits that she hoped Sischy would be “some sort of strikingly modern type, some astonishing new female sensibility loosed in the world.” What she found instead is that Sischy was, to put it simply, a good person: “a pleasant, intelligent, unassuming, responsible, ethical young woman.” Naturally, Malcolm concludes, “I . . . turned away in disappointment.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/books/review/forty-one-false-starts-by-janet-malcolm.html

Remove the stain of guilt, or at least of strong complicity, and what’s left? One more casualty, and casualties don’t command interest. They spread unease. And so it is with Amanda Knox — the Seattle college student accused of inducing Raffaele Sollecito, her boyfriend of one week, to join her in high jinks that led to the murder of her housemate Meredith Kercher when all three were studying in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. The two were convicted, along with Rudy Guede, a Perugino born in Ivory Coast, whose footprint and DNA matched the grisly trail in the room where Kercher’s half-naked body was found under a comforter, her throat slit.

2013-05-24,The Men Who Would Be King,"The story of the British invasion of Afghanistan in 1839-42 (what was later called the First Afghan War) can be briefly told. A British Army entered the country in April 1839, captured Kabul and ejected the ruler Dost Mohammad Khan. He was replaced by Shah Shuja, who had been living in exile since his overthrow by Dost Mohammad and his brother some 30 years earlier. The British expected Shah Shuja to be a more pliable king, a client of their Indian Raj, and a more reliable ally against the intrigues of the Russians. But they underestimated the resentment that their presence would arouse, and inflamed Afghan hostility by their overbearing behavior. After they failed to quell an uprising in Kabul and their envoy was murdered, they agreed to withdraw. But the retreating army of British officers, Indian soldiers and a multitude of camp followers was slaughtered almost to a man as it struggled back through the Khyber Pass in January 1842. Some months later, the British returned with an “army of retribution.” After a short stay in Kabul, and some indiscriminate killing, they withdrew once more. Dost Mohammad returned (with their blessing) to resume his place on the throne. Ever since this fiasco, an entire phalanx of writers has denounced the arrogance, folly and incompetence of the British aggressors (of which there was plenty) and has drawn a predictable lesson: those who invade Afghanistan pay a high price in treasure and blood — and also inflict one on its unlucky peoples. The latest (and most brilliant) in this long line of critics is William Dalrymple and his “Return of a King.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/books/review/the-men-who-would-be-king.html

(HBO) MAGIC MIKE (2012) In a role loosely inspired by his stint as a stripper in Florida, Channing Tatum (above left, with Matthew McConaughey) stars as the gyrating main attraction at the Xquisite dance club, in what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called “Steven Soderbergh’s funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream.” Alex Pettyfer plays Adam, a college dropout who is pushed onstage at Xquisite. At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” begins to throb. “What happens will be familiar if you’ve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “In the past the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here the stress is on Mike’s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture.” She added: “The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie’s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum’s heat and charm — and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike’s — with Mr. Soderbergh’s cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-05-27,What’s On Sunday,"9 P.M. (HBO) BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (2013) Michael Douglas, above, stars as the piano showman Liberace, and Matt Damon is Scott Thorson, his chauffeur, lover and adopted son, in this film biography from the director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Set in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Palm Springs, the film chronicles the men’s relationship as Liberace picks up and possesses Mr. Thorson, has him cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. “There’s something uncanny, even brilliant,” about Mr. Douglas’s impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum major’s puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizard’s predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a  famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer.” At the same time, he said, “there’s something limited, and limiting, about Mr. Douglas’s portrayal. Its brilliance feels as if it were all on the surface, a matter of expertise and professionalism.” And the same could be said of Mr. Soderbergh’s film, he added. “A cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic, it’s full of smart, funny details — perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglas’s blinding costumes — but it’s short on heart, or heat.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

It was curiosity alone that led the photographer, who died in 1989, to his first sleeping subject: himself. “I was surprised to see another self that existed in sleep that I didn’t know about,” he has said. Looking at these photos, I’m reminded of John Steinbeck, who wrote, “It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.” Spagna, more than anyone else, took us inside the committee room.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/ted-spagnas-sleep-studies/

I would lean toward a white, like a peppery grüner veltliner, especially one of the more age-worthy specimens. An Austrian riesling would also work well, and for a full dose of umami, why not a fino sherry? Among reds, a fresh, fragrant Chinon or Bourgueil from the Loire Valley would match well, and if you prefer a bolder wine, maybe a zinfandel from the lighter side of the spectrum.

Anyone who’s been looking for a job knows what I mean. It is best summed up by the mantra from the Harvard education expert Tony Wagner that the world doesn’t care anymore what you know; all it cares “is what you can do with what you know.” And since jobs are evolving so quickly, with so many new tools, a bachelor’s degree is no longer considered an adequate proxy by employers for your ability to do a particular job — and, therefore, be hired. So, more employers are designing their own tests to measure applicants’ skills. And they increasingly don’t care how those skills were acquired: home schooling, an online university, a massive open online course, or Yale. They just want to know one thing: Can you add value?",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/opinion/friedman-how-to-get-a-job.html

But these days, being an expert at an esoteric trade more likely leads to a reality show, and on Friday “Treehouse Masters” has its premiere on Animal Planet. It follows Mr. Nelson, who is 50, and his crew as they build one over-the-top arboreal home after another.

The fixtures, which have brass fittings and are lighted with LEDs, are not for reading, or for threading a needle. “They are mood-setting,” Ms. Benovic said. “They’re warm, and calming.” Prices range from $55 for a 10-inch-high lamp to $2,500 for a 43-inch-long chandelier. 208 East Sixth Street (Cooper Square).

The roll, which contains the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses, was stored in the library of the University of Bologna and mistakenly catalogued as a document from the 17th century. Mauro Perani, a professor of Hebrew, said that the scroll was written and its segments of sheepskin sewed together between 1155 and 1225. He said that it was not the oldest known biblical text, but it was the oldest scroll of the Pentateuch found so far. Two independent studies corroborated the scroll’s age through carbon-dating tests, the university said.

Mr. Jaua lashed out in a television broadcast at Mr. Santos for meeting in Bogotá, Colombia, with the opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski, who narrowly lost an April election won by Nicolás Maduro, the handpicked successor of Venezuela’s longtime president, Hugo Chávez. Mr. Chávez died in March. “President Santos has taken a step that, it must be said, will lead in a painful way to the derailing of the good relations we have,” Mr. Jaua said. He said that Mr. Maduro had recalled the country’s representative to the peace talks to discuss the situation. Colombia and the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, began peace negotiations in Havana last fall. Mr. Santos had praised Mr. Chávez, who had close ties to the FARC, for helping bring them to the table.

In Boston’s South End the Irish gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) reigns as the king of organized crime and stays one step ahead of the state police by inserting a snitch (Matt Damon) into the department. Responding in kind, a state police captain (Martin Sheen) asks Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio, at left above with Mr. Nicholson), a cadet with a propensity for violence, to go undercover and infiltrate Costello’s crew. “Mr. Scorsese’s sureness of touch, particularly when it comes to carving up space with the camera, keep the plot’s hall of mirrors from becoming a distraction,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “The plot thickens, then reaches full boil among further complications, dirty dealings, blood on the floor and excellent performances from Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg (as detectives), who own their every scene.” The film won four Oscars, including ones for best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

At one end of that desk there’s a space that used to be a closet, but at McCann’s request, the friend who built the office took off the door and put a platform in there, and this is where McCann writes, “in the cupboard,” as he put it. “It concentrates my vision. No windows, two very tight walls.” He sits on a couple of cushions with his computer on his lap. On the wall beside him are dozens of messages scrawled by friends and kids and fellow writers and some by McCann himself: “What is the source of our first suffering? It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.” “Keep yourself away from answers, but alive in the middle of the question.” “Stay rotten.” “Hi, Dad, I love you.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/magazine/colum-mccanns-radical-empathy.html

The artist Theaster Gates knows how creativity can invigorate a community. What happens when they put their heads together?At first glance, an Internet entrepreneur and an artist seem to operate in different creative spheres. Yet Perry Chen, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the crowd-funding Web site Kickstarter, and Theaster Gates, a Chicago art star-cum-urban planner, actually think they have a lot in common. Kickstarter began in 2009, and since then the site has raised more than $500 million for 40,000 projects — from Iraq war documentaries to Brooklyn restaurants — revolutionizing the way creative ideas are financed in the digital age. Theaster Gates’s artistic practice, which encompasses everything from sculpture to a roving choir, is in its way just as groundbreaking. On his own block on the South Side of Chicago, Gates has engineered a miniature urban utopia, turning the once-blighted buildings that surround him into artist residencies, a library and even a cinema house that shows works by aspiring filmmakers from the neighborhood.

Because of the “Choice Program” in our district, parents can apply to send their kids to almost any public school in the system. So parents in our neighborhood opt for magnet schools, charter schools or even the garden-variety public school a couple of miles away that gets better test scores than our “zone school” does. Or they skip the public options altogether and commute to schools with the words “Country Day” or “Our Lady” in their names.",Style,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/why-i-want-to-choose-the-disadvantaged-local-school-and-why-i-might-not/

Ms. Rodríguez said the woman could be induced to have either an abdominal or vaginal birth “because the important thing is saving Beatriz’s life.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/world/americas/el-salvador-doctors-can-induce-birth-to-save-woman-official-says.html

Tolkien has had an active after­life; reviewing the book in The Los Angeles Times last month, Elizabeth Hand noted that it lists nine works published during his lifetime and 24 published posthumously (at least six of which have been best sellers). Hand liked the book, with some reservations: “ ‘The Fall of Arthur’ is a fascinating work, though perhaps more for the Tolkien completist than the casual ‘Lord of the Rings’ fan,” she wrote. “It focuses on the bloody aftermath of Queen Guinevere’s affair with Lancelot, greatest of Arthur’s knights, and is surprisingly powerful in its terse depiction of the affair’s devastating consequences.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Studio Christofle, as it’s called, opened in early May and looks unexpectedly eclectic for the home of a venerable French silver company. The styling and merchandising of the 1,100-square-foot space is a result of two strategic collaborations. JF Chen antiques furnished it with pieces like a 19th century Chinese wedding armoire (now styled with Christofle candelabra, pitchers and vases) and Marco Zanini’s throne-line Roma chair for Memphis. Arcana: Books on the Arts supplied rare art, architecture, fashion and design books. “Christofle has different faces,” said Stéphane Parmentier, the company’s creative director, who organized the store. “We are traditional, but we are also youthful and practical.” ",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/garden/christofle-pop-up-opens-in-west-hollywood.html

He read passages aloud to his professors and learned Spanish so that he could follow in Humboldt’s footsteps. Humboldt’s “Personal Narrative,” Darwin later wrote, “stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science.” At age 22, he embarked on his own voyage around the world, out of which he would develop his theory of evolution.

The entire endeavor was calibrated to maximize pleasure and minimize hardship, and so I learned nothing. I relaxed. I kept myself entertained.

It’s a memoir with only the slightest hints of conflict or struggle, apart from an early scene in which young Lucy is attacked by a flock of geese. (“I have since eaten foie gras with great enjoyment and very little guilt,” she notes.) She maps out her emotional associations with her favorite foods — Venetian croissants, sautéed mushrooms, McDonald’s fries and so on — in a breezy clear-line style, lingering over treasured moments, like resting her hand against Richard Serra’s “Tilted Arc” during a catering gig. Between chapters, Knisley offers simple, neatly diagrammed recipes (chocolate chip cookies! pesto! sangria!). Her language, like her drawings, is precise and uncluttered: in one of the book’s liveliest sequences, 12-year-old Lucy and a friend wander through a little Mexican town, discovering treats like “sweet corn on a stick, with hot sauce and lime, which turned the corners of our mouths red.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/books/review/relish-by-lucy-knisley-and-more.html

Though she’s best known as the frontwoman for the Fiery Furnaces, the Brooklyn indie rock band she founded with her brother Matthew more than a decade ago, the release of “Personal Record” (Merge), her second solo album next week, should solidify her identity as a stand-alone musician. Steeped in the analog sounds of Me Decade icons like Harry Nilsson, Emitt Rhodes and Caetano Veloso, the album is more mellifluous and emotionally resonant than the Furnaces’ eccentric work. Instead, it builds on the classic song craft of Friedberger’s 2011 solo debut, “Last Summer,” interweaving bossa nova beats and British folk balladry with summer-road-trip rock ‘n’ roll. It’s as relatable — and as much a career high-water mark — as its title suggests. “I don’t get to hide under a band blanket,” she says of flying solo. “But it also feels more authentically me.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/listen-up-eleanor-friedbergers-70s-song-craft/

2013-05-31,Hidden in Plain Sight,"In the late 1970s, I purchased a half-dozen pocket-size paperback books that bore the name Ed Ruscha. I hadn’t heard of the California artist at the time — I just liked the look of his booklets. One was bound with ribbon; the rest were perfect binds. There were no cover pictures; only widely spaced titles typeset in a serif font that I also liked to use, called Stymie Bold. The cover designs were distinct yet understated, reminiscent of small-press poetry collections. Inside were photographic records of what each title promised — “Various Small Fires,”  “Thirtyfour Parking Lots,”  “Twentysix Gasoline Stations,”  “Nine Swimming Pools,”  “Crackers” (with text by Mason Williams on “How to Derive the Maximum Enjoyment From Crackers”) and “Babycakes” (with photographs of, yes, a baby and cakes). They were puzzling yet clearly ironic, prefiguring many books by today’s conceptual artists. The critical mass of decidedly mundane pictures gave them their allure. Marcel Duchamp’s “ready-mades” and Andy Warhol’s soup cans had already elevated everyday objects to the status of art, but Ruscha’s small books brought the ennobled vernacular back down to earth.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/books/review/various-small-books-inspired-by-ed-ruscha-and-more.html

The 12 issues included in this edition were written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Bryan Hitch. The series was originally bought in 1999, and captured some creative magic. The heroes (Jenny Sparks, who embodied the spirit of the 20th Century; Apollo and Midnighter, crime-fighting lovers who were analogues of Superman and Batman; Jack Hawksmoor, who could communicate with and control cities) were captivating, and the artwork was exquisite. The first year found the heroes fighting bigger and bigger threats as a team. The first four issues featured a nation of terrorists who were bred to have Superman-like powers and who were bent on destroying major world cities. The middle story arc featured an invasion from a parallel word. The final four issues featured the team confronting no less than the incomprehensible godlike creator of the solar system that wanted to cleanse the universe of humanity. (The heroes won!) Versions of these heroes continue to be featured in “Stormwatch,” a monthly series published by DC, but there are only sparks of the audaciousness that were once a hallmark of the series.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/graphic-books-best-sellers-the-authority-saves-humanity/

In the essay, “Evening the Score,” I expressed the fear that my abysmal performance would land me in community college, not thinking for a second that I might offend anyone. Yet, I did. While unabashedly Yahooing myself a while later, I discovered I had been granted the (THE!) 2001 Shame Award by the Two Year College Association. It took a minute for the full weight of it to hit me. Ever so slowly, the smile spread across my face. I won! Not only was it one of the only awards I’d ever received, it proved that someone actually read my piece. My only regret was that I had been given the award in absentia (talk about shameful, I wasn’t even invited to that year’s T.W.C.A. convention, where the honor was announced) and therefore had no plaque or certificate to hang next to my four-year college diploma (which I did in fact earn, despite my standardized-test deficiencies).",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/how-to-write-a-personal-essay-that-you-know-will-be-torn-apart-in-the-comments-section/

2013-06-03,‘The People’s Car: A Global History of the Volkswagen Beetle’,"After decades of austerity caused first by the Depression and prolonged by the Second World War, the fifties turned into a “golden age of the American automobile” that saw car registra­tions jump from 25.8 million in 1945 to 52.1 million in 1955. Lifestyle changes underpinned demand for cars. As the postwar suburban population grew by 43 percent between 1947 and 1953, daily routines, not least those of women who wished to visit the new suburban shopping malls and plazas, increasingly relied on access to individual transport. The car and the housing booms were intimately linked, with average individual expenditure on these items tripling in real terms between 1941 and 1961. By the end of the fifties, 40 percent of American drivers  were female — a far higher proportion than anywhere in Western Eu rope. As a dealer told a journalist investigating why Americans bought Volkswagens in 1955, the car “‘was just the thing for the wife to run around town in.’ Two- car suburbia is where Volkswagen has made its biggest inroads.” Market surveys from the fifties and early sixties also revealed that, while over 60 percent of Beetles registered in the United States served as second cars, about two- thirds of the customers who signed a purchase con­tract in a dealership had attended college. In short, Volkswagen attracted a foothold among the materially secure, white middle class whose members made up the bulk of suburbanites in the fifties.",Automobiles,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/automobiles/excerpt-the-peoples-car.html

Overhanging trees and thorn bushes dangled in my path, scratching my face and ripping my waterproofs, allowing yet more rain to soak me quite literally, to the skin. This was wild, high, open country with not a glimmer of civilisation in sight; there were no people living here now, long since driven out in the civil war’s slashing and burning of the villages. I longed to see some evidence of the human hand at work, just a hut or a farmhouse, a truck or car.

They were told a ground-up is mandatory. Was the preservation motivated by parsimony? And of course a trophy was out of the question. The mainstream seemed to abhor imperfection. While acknowledging their vehicle was technical jewelry in every way, they shamelessly changed its colors, trim, and even its design. Scores of unusual animals were sacrificed to add wow to the trim. No nut, bolt, or tie-rod arm escaped the chrome plater’s tank. Wire wheel spokes scintillated on the podium. Novel colors were protected with clear coat.
