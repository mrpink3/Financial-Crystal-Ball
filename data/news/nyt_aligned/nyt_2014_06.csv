2014-06-02,What’s On Sunday,"10 P.M. (AMC) HALT AND CATCH FIRE Set in Texas during the 1980s tech boom, this new series stars Lee Pace (“Lincoln,” “Pushing Daisies”) as Joe McMillan, a former IBM salesman who enlists the help of a has-been computer engineer (Scoot McNairy, above left, with Mackenzie Davis and Mr. Pace) and a talented computer science student (Ms. Davis) to reverse-engineer an IBM PC. The story is fiction, but based on the actual technology race of that decade, in which companies were trying to create their own version of a PC. With AMC’s “Mad Men,” focusing on the ad executive Don Draper, ending next year, the network “seems to be looking for another period drama that can seduce viewers with old-fashioned customs and atavistic sins,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “Joe, like Don, is handsome, suave and moodily enigmatic, a salesman who pitches his product with passionate intensity.” Unfortunately, “Halt and Catch Fire” doesn’t seem to carry the same panache. “The period music is fun, but there is nothing particularly glamorous about high-tech Dallas. Most of all, the early 1980s are not a distant enough memory to cast a retro glow.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

In the overture (and again in Act II), a sweet, high, ravishing violin melody suddenly takes the air after a soft horn introduction, like the answer to a prayer or light after darkness.

2014-06-02,Another Ending for Arsenio Hall,"The February announcement that Arsenio Hall’s syndicated late-night show would return for a second season turned out to be both premature and mistaken. CBS Television Distribution, which owns the show with Tribune Media, has announced a cancellation because of a ratings decline among the viewers most advertisers pay for in late night, people between the ages of 18 and 49. (The ratings leader in that group is Jimmy Fallon on NBC.) Mr. Hall, left, who had a hit syndicated late-night show in the early 1990s, revived the franchise with some fanfare in September, and he scored some early impressive ratings. But the late-night scene had become intensely crowded, with as many as 10 shows fighting for a shrinking number of viewers. The ratings drop set in motion a pattern of downgrades from a host of local television stations, which began relegating Mr. Hall’s show to little-watched hours of the night. In February, his old friend Jay Leno appeared on the show with a letter confirming a second year. The ratings slide forced CBS’s syndication division to rescind that decision.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/business/media/another-ending-for-arsenio-hall.html

I’ve made the cookies using half whole-wheat flour and using all unbleached all-purpose flour, and I prefer the whole-wheat version – and not just because it’s healthier:The nutty flavor of the flour complements the nutty flavor of the seeds.

2014-06-04,What’s On Wednesday,"6:45 P.M. (Starz) WHITE HOUSE DOWN (2013) A police officer and former soldier (Channing Tatum) interviewing for a job with the Secret Service (he doesn’t get it) finds himself in the White House at the very moment it is overrun by a paramilitary group in this action-adventure directed by Roland Emmerich. Jamie Foxx (above right, with Mr. Tatum) plays the president, who needs saving — from the terrorists, and from big business — if only for his workable peace plan for the Middle East. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, Richard Jenkins, Lance Reddick and Jason Clarke portray the administration’s team players. The film “is as demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Emmerich “makes the opening siege unsettling enough to grab your attention and then, once he has it, begins folding in lighter moments — one-liners, cartoonish bits of business, laughably impossible situations and stunts — that ensure that at least this American collapse doesn’t end up feeling too heavy.” He “gives it the pow,” she added, “while Mr. Tatum provides the pulse.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

2014-06-04,Yemen: Deadly Fighting Flares," The most recent flare-up in the long-running fight between the Yemeni Army and Shiite insurgents in the country’s north has killed hundreds of people in the past three weeks, local officials said Tuesday. The clashes, in Amran Province, began when the rebels sought to claim new territory closer to the capital, said Ahmad al-Bakry, the province’s deputy governor. He said more than 500 people had been killed, including 100 rebels and 20 soldiers in the past two days. The toll could not be independently verified. On Monday, the government sent jets to bomb rebel areas after rebels came close to taking over a government checkpoint, Mr. Bakry said. A Houthi rebel leader, Ali al-Bikhiti, linked the violence to grievances over governmental neglect. “What is happening in Amran is a revolt against injustice,” Mr. Bikhiti said.

After a review of medical records, the country’s total number of cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome since the virus was isolated in 2012 is now 688, up from 575; the death toll is 282, not 190. The country has had a surge of cases since March — many apparently originating in hospitals — but they seem to be falling off, an adviser to the Health Ministry said. That surge led to the dismissal of the health minister, and on Monday, his replacement dismissed the deputy health minister who has been the public face of the country’s response. The deputy, Dr. Ziad Memish, was recently  profiled in The Lancet for his preparations for the annual visit to Mecca by up to three million Muslims. Most of the 133 new cases are from March and April, suggesting that many were either not tested or not reported. ",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/health/saudi-arabia-mers-toll-revised.html

2014-06-04,Desire in High Gear,"Here is your Urban Dictionary lesson of the week: A “village bicycle” is slang for a local slut — everyone in town has ridden the bike, you see. The term has a double meaning, though, in Penelope Skinner’s play “The Village Bike,” making its American debut in an MCC Theater production.

The duo’s latest offering, debuting exclusively on Net-a-Porter today, is a capsule collection that highlights what de Verdelhan calls “a key part of the environmental footprint of making garments”: dye. The six-piece assortment gets its striking shade from woad, a medicinal plant in the broccoli family that the designers discovered in a workshop in a village near Toulouse, France. The ancient species was a key component of southern France’s economy during the Medieval and Renaissance eras; royalty and high society, including Napoleon, favored it for its distinctive blue hue. It’s also known for the anti-inflammatory and healing properties it provides when applied to the skin, and is unusual in the way that it continues to “live” as a garment ages. “The color grows stronger as you wash the material, and, if left in the closet, it will become irregular,” explains Verdelhan. “It’s such a beautiful, particular blue, and is quite important in Toulouse. There, all the shutters are painted in this color. It’s quite lovely.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/baserange-modern-basics-dyed-with-ancient-medicinal-plants/

In her images, houseplants and pet birds survive on little sunlight, and paintings and photos of tropical waterfronts and Paris landmarks are hung alongside trash cans, exercise equipment and laundry machines. The supers told her that the spaces can be tricky to protect. “Every time I maintain it, people steal my paintings from me,” one said. But another super has managed to attract tourists to his well-appointed home. “It brings them to tears to see the basement,” he said.

2014-06-05,Not Really an Ocean Apart,"It has been 40 years since the French furniture company Roche Bobois planted a flag in the United States, but only recently did it invite an American to design for its collection. On Thursday, the company is introducing two chairs by Stephen Burks, a New Yorker, that riff on consumer tastes in different parts of the world. Called Traveler, the chairs come in a European version with a canopied tubular metal structure and leather upholstery ($11,800 with canopy) and an American version in wood and fabric ($11,800). Mr. Burks said the first chair expresses a “micro-architectural moment” and celebrates craft, whereas the second signals deep, satisfying comfort: “It’s like a giant pillow,” he said. But don’t take these ideas too literally, he added. “There is so much diversity within cultures, it would be a gross exaggeration to say, ‘I’ve summed up Europe in a chair, or summed up America.’ ” Available in September.

The man, Michael Greub, 42, was leaving a meeting with colleagues when their vehicle came under attack, it said. No possible motives were disclosed, but foreign workers and diplomats have come under increasing threat from armed groups that have operated with impunity in Libya since its revolt in 2011. The killing came amid intensifying violence in the eastern city of Benghazi, where a self-proclaimed army leader, Gen. Khalifa Hifter declared war on Islamist militias almost three weeks ago. He was lightly wounded Wednesday when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden truck into a base where the general was staying east of Benghazi.

The bill follows a Canadian Supreme Court ruling in December that overturned most laws governing the sex trade on the basis that they violated prostitutes’ constitutional right to security. While Justice Minister Peter MacKay said the bill aimed to focus on pimps and the customers of prostitutes, he added that prostitutes who offered their services in public areas where children might be present would, in most cases, be fined. The bill would also make advertising sexual services a crime. Some lawyers for prostitutes argued that the measure did not address the court’s concern about prostitutes’ safety.

(Starz Cinema) INCENDIES (2011) The adult children (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette) of an Arab woman, Nawal (Lubna Azabal, above), living in Canada travel to an unnamed country that closely resembles Lebanon to seek out a brother they never knew existed on the instructions of Nawal’s last will and testament. In the process, they learn that their mother, a Christian, had fallen in love with a Muslim and fled her hometown, becoming in succession a student, an activist, a clandestine militant, a political prisoner — and more. The director Denis Villeneuve “tells Nawal’s story in a way that is both subtle and emphatic, and Ms. Azabal, portraying Nawal from hopeful youth to despairing middle age, gives a performance that is all the more powerful for the restrained, unshakable sense of dignity she brings to it,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film, based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad. “The depth and complexity of her anger is both a product and a mirror of her native country’s self-destructive pathology, and as the full horror of her life is disclosed, she becomes, in her children’s eyes and the audience’s, as grand and tragic as the heroine of an opera.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

The merger would create a more formidable rival to the two largest wireless phone providers in the United States, Verizon and AT&T. Under the terms of the deal, Sprint, which is majority-owned by Japan’s SoftBank, would acquire T-Mobile for about $40 a share in cash and stock, a 17 percent premium to Wednesday’s price.

This outpost is Australia’s national capital — not, as is commonly thought, the glitzier city of Sydney, three hours’ drive north. In Canberra, there are no beaches or iconic opera houses, and European chic is best sought an hour’s flight away in Melbourne. But what the “bush capital” lacks in big-city tousle, it makes up for in big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly. Set on an artificial lake and spread across a valley between mountain ranges, Canberra is the Brasilia of Australia, designed by the American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, who won a competition in 1911 to create the country’s political heart because Sydney and Melbourne couldn’t stop bickering about their own fabulousness. A year after the city’s centennial celebrations and with a steady influx of artists and gastronomes, Canberra is best appreciated with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/travel/36-hours-in-canberra-australia.html

A year before her death, elderly Laura Bridgman meets a busy-handed child named Helen Keller. Next we witness a much earlier historic encounter when Laura, at 12, meets Charles Dickens. The elder Laura is grumpy; the adolescent loops between self-aggrandizement and epic self-doubt. We’re asked to forgive all, because of circumstances more dire than any invented by Dickens or borne by Keller. As a baby, Laura suffered an illness that took her sight, hearing, and senses of smell and taste. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/what-is-visible-by-kimberly-elkins.html

The Arab News quoted Fahd Balghuneim, the agriculture minister, as saying the tests to determine the extent of infection would be conducted via blood or mucus samples. Saudi Arabia has in the past few days adopted a more aggressive response to the virus, known as MERS, which originated in the country two years ago and has been linked to camels, which spread the virus to humans. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry said a review showed that the death toll was 282, 92 more than reported a day earlier, and it announced that the deputy health minister had been relieved. On Wednesday, in the clearest evidence yet that MERS can be passed directly from camels to humans, research published in The New England Journal of Medicine said genetic sequencing had shown that a Saudi man who died of MERS in November had a strain virtually identical to that in one of the camels in his herd.

He’s now swinging from the high wire with THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD (Little, Brown, $26), a heart-thumping backwoods adventure that sends two creatively sadistic killers into Montana’s Beartooth Mountains, where they spark a monster forest fire to flush out the only witness to their crimes: Jace Wilson, a 14-year-old boy. Jace was just trying to escape his reputation as class coward when he dived into a quarry near his Indiana home. But when he swam into a dead man — and spotted the killers flinging a second victim into the water — Jace knew he was going to die. Reborn with a new name, he finds himself among the “bad kids” in a grueling wilderness survival course, parked there when his parents couldn’t be persuaded to put him in a traditional witness protection program. Jace’s hunters, the Blackwell brothers, are heartless sociopaths whose professional detachment is etched in their unnervingly precise grammar and careful diction. (“The way they say things. Like they’re alone in the world. Like it was built for the two of them and they’re lords over it.”) There will be no mercy from that quarter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/michael-korytas-those-who-wish-me-dead-and-more.html

Seven years earlier — a period that evokes the scent of a fairy tale — she had moved to New York from Rome on a whim, having secured a place in a creative writing workshop at the New School. She fell in love with the city and so has never left, despite the fact that this place she adores hasn’t exactly opened its arms to welcome her. She found work as a language teacher, initially telling herself this is simply “a way to pay the rent.” But, as is often the way with the quotidian, “teaching became her real job and she forgot about other aspirations.” And yet those aspirations don’t quite disappear. In the fresh new days of spring, she determines to put together a book, “The Italian System,” about how to live a Roman life in New York.

Brilliant, except my skin was so bad I needed about 16 beauty marks. I went out with my girlfriends with black dots all over my face thinking I had the world fooled. They took one look at me and asked, ‘What . . . did you do to your face?’ ” These days, Michele more often opts for a homemade facial mask and the services of a professional dermatologist to keep her skin clear.

And things started well enough: The host country breezed through to the final match, where, because of tournament rules at the time, it needed only a draw against Uruguay to win the whole event. With little more than 10 minutes to go, the score was 1-1, and the fans were on edge.

This welcome new recording from the impressive Boston Modern Orchestra Project offers three ingeniously written and distinctive Spratlan works. “A Summer’s Day” (2008) uses a simple, dreamy Celtic tune at the start as a jumping-off place for an elusive, complex suite that ruminates on the tensions below the surface of an inviting day. In his Concerto for Saxophone and Orchestra (2006), Mr. Spratlan finds a gripping, fresh approach to what might seem an awkward classical music genre; the music evolves from mystical musings to raw, jazzy vehemence. “Apollo and Daphne Variations” is like a Spratlan version of a Schumann suite, with alternating episodes of whimsy, frenzy and innocence.

(The current child tax credit has a phase-out that begins at $110,000 for married joint filings.) But as a coda, it’s worth noting that to the extent that family-friendly policy actually boosts fertility — a highly uncertain question, to be sure — egalitarian liberals might want to think twice about a child tax credit phase-out, because then they wouldn’t reap the potentially egalitarian benefits of higher fertility in the upper class.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/inequality-fertility-and-the-rich/

This year’s edition, directed by Rem Koolhaas, gets back to the basics of modern architecture, with dozens of exhibitions at national pavilions that delve into formative moments of the 20th century. The Swiss Pavilion is headed by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, the omnivorous curator and co-director of exhibitions and programs at the Serpentine Galleries in London. In it, Obrist has brought together two 20th-century figures whose research has influenced architectural thinking in their own time and since: the Swiss political economist Lucius Burckhardt and the English architect Cedric Price.

2014-06-09,"Nazi Art-Looting Case May Proceed, Court Rules","A federal appeals court in California issued a potentially far-reaching decision Friday that allows the victims of Nazi-related looting and their heirs to press ahead with legal efforts to reclaim stolen artwork.  The case involves two large portrayals of Adam and Eve by the 14th-century master Lucas Cranach the Elder that were taken from the prominent Jewish Dutch dealer Jacques Goudstikker in a forced sale and are now in the collection of the Norton Simon Museum in California. Goudstikker’s daughter-in-law, Marei Von Saher, has been trying to reclaim the dyptich for years but has repeatedly run into legal stumbling blocks.  In a 2-to-1 decision, though, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a lower court’s decision and permitted Ms. Von Saher’s lawsuit to proceed.  The diptych was recovered and returned to the Netherlands after World War II, when the Dutch negotiated a partial settlement with Goudstikker’s widow, which did not cover the work. The Norton Simon bought the paintings in 1971 from a collector. In 2012, a district judge ruled against Ms. Von Saher, saying that the United States had fulfilled its obligations to restitute the art, and that any effort to alter the Dutch resolution of the case would interfere with the federal government’s sole authority over foreign policy. But the appeals panel noted that the United States had signed two international agreements — one in Washington in 1998, and another in Terezin, Czech Republic, in 2009 — intended to remove obstacles to the recovery of possessions stolen by the Nazis.  The Norton Simon released a statement saying it “remains confident that it holds complete and proper title” to the paintings and that it would “continue to pursue, consistent with its fiduciary duties, all appropriate legal options.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/arts/design/nazi-art-looting-case-may-proceed-court-rules.html

2014-06-09,What’s On Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) ENOUGH SAID (2013) Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in a Golden Globe-nominated role, plays Eva, a divorced massage therapist in Los Angeles who finds her life emptying out as her daughter (Tracey Fairaway) prepares to leave for Sarah Lawrence College. Then she meets Albert (James Gandolfini, above, with Ms. Louis-Dreyfus), another divorced parent of a college-bound girl, and although he isn’t her usual type, Eva suddenly finds herself falling for this funny, tender and sexy slob. Enter Marianne (Catherine Keener), a glamorous bohemian poet and Eva’s new client — who, Eva finds out a little too late, also happens to be Albert’s former wife. And so Eva listens to Marianne’s complaints about her ex — he’s a bore and a loser, clumsy in bed and unable to take care of himself — and surreptitiously tries to correct the faults in Albert that caused their marriage to disintegrate. “The real genius of ‘Enough Said’ is that it takes this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlocks both its farcical potential and its latent profundity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this “small miracle of a movie” written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. “This movie will make you laugh and leave you in tears. Some of the pathos is the accidental byproduct of seeing Mr. Gandolfini, so playful and alive, in one of his final major movie roles and feeling once again the loss of his remarkable gift. There is also the pang of the empty nest, that mixture of grief and pride that is the special anguish of modern parents. But there is also something deeper. The ache that ‘Enough Said’ leaves behind comes from the blunt force of truth.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

BuzzFeed’s $46 million in venture capital. But the eight-year-old site’s founder, the viral-content guru Jonah Peretti, 40, isn’t satisfied with just being the king of workday distractions. With the help of editor in chief Ben Smith, BuzzFeed has been making a play for serious journalism, with political scoops and breaking news stories percolating inside offices named after Internet-famous cats.

Lisa is working to devise menus for schools that meet or exceed the Department of Agriculture’s Healthier US Schools Challenge requirements. With a deep understanding of the ingredients that school lunch programs have to work with, she developed a white bean and yogurt salad dressing base.

2014-06-09,Outsmarting Breast Cancer With Evolving Therapies,"Over the past few decades, changes in the treatment of breast cancer amount to a revolution in patient care. And it’s not over yet. There was a time when the standard approach was a radical mastectomy, which involved removal of not just the breast, but all the lymph nodes in the armpit and underlying muscles in the chest wall. This approach has been replaced by less extensive surgery that, through decades of clinical trials, has proved to be equally effective at treating patients, as well as safer and less disfiguring. Even simple mastectomies, in which most nodes and the muscles were left intact, have become far less common. Dr. J. Dirk Iglehart, director of the Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, estimated that he now performs a tenth of the number of mastectomies than when he entered the field in the 1970s.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/outsmarting-breast-cancer-with-evolving-therapies/

In March, a panel of United Nations investigators published a report documenting what it called systematic and widespread human rights violations against political prisoners and others in the North.

2014-06-11,After Eric Cantor,"During the government shutdown last year, I wrote a series of posts trying to explain why anyone interested in a healthy conservatism, a viable and serious Republican Party, should be somewhat ambivalent about the fight between the party’s insurgents and its congressional leadership. The insurgents pushed for the shutdown and the establishment resisted it, which meant that on the major question of the moment that establishment was right and the insurgents were not only wrong but utterly disconnected from reality. But in the bigger picture, the insurgents’ critique of the establishment’s lazy, K Street-oriented, “repeal the Medical device tax!” approach to policymaking was quite frequently correct, and it was noteworthy that some of the most prominent figures supporting the shutdown (Mike Lee, most notably, but also Marco Rubio and Rand Paul) were also sources of much of the party’s post-2012 policy innovation. So the post-shutdown scenario favored by many centrist observers in the media, in which John Boehner and Mitch McConnell just found a way to crush the grassroots and bring their base to heel, was not really a long-term solution to the G.O.P.’s lack of vision and seriousness. Instead — somehow, somewhere — the party would need to find leadership that could channel grassroots populism into a constructive agenda, without being captured by that populism’s follies and excesses.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/after-eric-cantor/

Instead, he recreated “the feeling of a grand old family home so that a guest room doesn’t feel like a hotel room,” he said. Built in the Colonial style, the building (across the street from the inn) later was “Victorianized,” to borrow Mr. O’Connell’s verb. And its décor has remained that way, though the palette was lighter than one usually finds in Victorians. The exterior and the porch facing a courtyard are painted green with cream accents. Interior walls are pale or papered in light colors, including the walls flanking a window seat in a second-floor guest room. Rooms start at $575 a night.

Grovemade’s wood iPhone case has already appeared in the cult TV series “Portlandia.” If that show were to do a full-bore Grovemade parody, what product would be required? “I guess they’d have us make a high-end bike-polo stick,” Mr. Mansfield said. “It’s all the rage in Portland.” Information: grovemade.com. ",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/modernist-birds-can-roost-here.html

Gabby Sabharwal, the designer of the swimwear label Giejo, a collection made with vintage fabrics, worked with a brush-stroke print after seeing the painterly inspirations on the spring runways. Yodit Eklund, who designs the African surf and beach label Bantu, developed the prints for her collaboration with J. Crew from traditional West African wax cloth patterns. Her color palette was based on 1970s funk and high-life album covers from Africa. Kenzo swimsuits echo the popular fish motifs in its spring collection. And as Ms. Eklund points out, a swimsuit is an easy way to pull off ... well, loud prints. “The surface area of a swimsuit is naturally small, so swimwear is a great opportunity to play with print without a head-to-toe look that might be overwhelming.”",Fashion & Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/fashion/Prints-Bikinis-Tote-That-Helps-Rescue-Puppies-Clyde-visor-Shop-Latitude-.html

Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario; and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he’s crushing grapes for homemade wine. “Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this “mostly funny comedy” from David Wain. “Like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while.

For the Republicans of Virginia’s Seventh Congressional District, even Mr. Cantor, “who had been one of the most implacable opponents to the reform of immigration, health care and taxation,” was apparently too moderate. “His crime (in addition to complacent campaigning)?

Its name, spelled out in blocky white letters, was recognizable, too, except for a blunt détournement up top: DUMB STARBUCKS COFFEE. The store was the creation of Nathan Fielder, a Canadian-born comedian, and he designed it to look exactly like an outpost of the ubiquitous coffee chain — that is, until you realized that the word “dumb” was everywhere. The menu listed 27 beverages with names like Dumb Iced Caramel Macchiato and Dumb Chai Tea Latte. Cups came in sizes from Dumb Tall to Dumb Venti. Two baristas manned the counter, with DUMB STARBUCKS COFFEE emblazoned on their green aprons. “I hired them on Craigslist,” Fielder told me recently. “The ad actually asked for people who worked at Starbucks before, so we wouldn’t have to train them.” A rack of easy-listening CDs kept to the theme: “Dumb Jazz Standards,” “Dumb Norah Jones Duets.” The cafe quietly opened for business on a Friday last February. “I didn’t expect things to get as crazy as they did,” Fielder said.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/magazine/nathan-fielder.html

Throughout her career, Hawes offered an honest, often funny appraisal of the fashion world as it was and as she thought it should be. She was a proponent of using style to get what you want (and, essentially, to become who you want to be), and a wicked critic. While researching the piece, Gregory amassed a collection of Hawes’s wittiest one-liners from her nine books.

The brother-sister duo grew up around Chicago, a city that’s more Buddy Guy than Bob Marley, and spent much of their childhood like modern-day Von Trapps, singing songs around the piano with their parents and two other siblings. Elliot, who plays keyboard and saxophone and, at 32, is seven years Natalie’s senior, would go on to study jazz and play in an Afrobeat band, Nomo, at the University of Michigan. And the siblings’ travels, both literal and sonic, helped expand their musical purview. The resulting mix of sounds — indie pop tinged with reggae and ’70s soul — can be heard throughout Wild Belle’s debut album, “Isles,” released last year. And though they insist the title is more about the album’s structure than its influences (“each song is its own island,” Natalie has said), it might just as easily be a nod to Chris Blackwell’s Island Records, whose catalogue of ska and reggae hits surely left an impression.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/q-and-a-wild-belle-spreads-its-island-vibes/

The technique, photographed here by Seth Casteel, who is working on a related book that will come out next spring, was pioneered in the late ’60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor’s child.

The paperback follows on the heels of another book that should appeal to Gaiman’s fans — Hayley Campbell’s winningly scrapbookish tribute, “The Art of Neil Gaiman,” which Audrey Niffenegger describes in the foreword as “a sort of midcareer retrospective.” The book recounts Gaiman’s early days as a hungry arts journalist and his rise to cult success as a writer of comic books, notably the “Sandman” series, before he turned his hand to novels. It also reminds readers that Neil himself (as he’s known on Twitter) once wrote a scrapbookish tribute of his own: His first published book — “written solely for the money,” he says — was “Duran Duran: The First Four Years of the Fab Five” (1984). “I got a phone call from a lady,” Gaiman explains in an interview cited in the book, “and she said would you like to write a rock ’n’ roll book for us? A rock ’n’ roll biography? And I thought, ‘Oh God, yes! I’m in!’ ” Gaiman suggested a handful of subjects, including the Velvet Underground, David Bowie and Elvis Costello, before the editor interrupted: “Do you want to write the Duran Duran book, the Barry Manilow book or the Def Leppard book?” Pragmatism led him to choose the relative newcomers Duran Duran. “With Barry Manilow,” he said, “I figured I was going to have to listen to, you know, 40 Barry Manilow albums.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2014-06-13,Office Max,"How you work depends in large part on the spaces in which you work. This big theme is taken up by Nikil Saval in “Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.” There is in fact nothing “secret” about this history; from the Civil War on, as the white-collar world grew, managers and designers thought out loud about where workers should sit, the furniture they should use, the walls and windows that should surround them. Instead of a secret history, Saval, an editor of n+1, has written something more interesting. He has infused a straightforward factual account with all sorts of literary, cultural and political insights; these make the story he tells more dark than dry.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/cubed-by-nikil-saval.html

Carrion birds are feasting: “Crows, their beaks shining, strutting and rasping, and when I waved my stick they flew to the trees and watched, flaring out their wings, singing, if you could call it that.” Jake shouts, “What are you laughing at?” and throws a rock at them.

2014-06-13,It Was a Dark and Stormy Night,"Val McDermid’s “Northanger Abbey” is the second book to emerge from the Austen Project, in which Jane Austen’s published oeuvre is reimagined by 21st-­century authors. But early on her heroine, Cat Morland, encounters, via audiobook, the Gothic work of another 19th-century novelist — Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.” “For Cat,” we are told, “schooled only in contemporary vampire romance, it was a curious and unsettling experience. It reminded her of the first time she’d tasted an olive. It was unlike everything that had crossed her palate before; strange and not quite pleasant, yet gilded with the promise of sophistication.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/val-mcdermids-northanger-abbey.html

2014-06-13,Southern Living,"Throughout Frances Mayes’s idylls about “the sweet life in Italy” — the subtitle of one of her best-selling memoirs — there are glimpses of a childhood, far less blissful, in the American South. In “Bella Tuscany,” she mentions her “tyrant” grandfather, Daddy Jack. In “Under the Tuscan Sun,” she touches on her “resigned disappointed ancestors” back home. Even as she enjoys a “pure surge of pleasure” while restoring Bramasole, a villa near Cortona, Italy, and discovering what it means to “surprise your own life,” she must keep the shadows cast by the town of Fitzgerald, Ga., at bay. “To put it mildly,” she remarks in passing of her father, Garbert, “he was a difficult man and to complicate that, he died at 47.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/under-magnolia-by-frances-mayes.html
2014-06-13,Nothing to Hide,"Paula Bomer writes the kind of women’s fiction that critics like to call “raw.” Her stark portrayals of biological womanhood have been described as raw and angry, raw and darkly funny, brutally raw and urgent. The word is meant literally, to a degree: Her earlier books, “Nine Months” and “Baby,” feature birth scenes that spare no anatomical detail. But “raw” has also come to mean something specific in blurb-speak about quasi-confessional writing by women, and it’s not always fitting or fair. Half praise, half dis, it commends the struggle to embrace female ugliness while finding the work unsatisfactory. “Raw” work is visceral but also hard to digest — a kind term, in other words, for something half-baked.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/inside-madeleine-by-paula-bomer.html

As witty as its English forebear but with French savoir-faire, “The Foundling Boy” may win new readers for books translated from French, of which too few are published. English PEN and Arts Council England have supported Julian Evans’s translation, evidently in hopes of broadening our reading of these classics.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/the-foundling-boy-by-michel-deon.html

The result is a book that is alternately impressive and infuriating. Dickie has amassed and digested an astonishing mass of material (tens of thousands of pages of trial documents, newspaper accounts and secondary literature) and followed scores of different characters (bandits, crime bosses, policemen, judges, politicians) in disparate places across a 150-year span. And yet he has managed, despite the girth and diversity, to sustain an argument and a story. He entertains the reader with dozens of fascinating figures — both noble and blood-chilling — while making frequently shrewd judgments that place this story in context, as a central feature of Italian life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/john-dickies-blood-brotherhoods.html

2014-06-13,Document | Act Natural,"Soon after the Canadian-born artist Leanne Shapton ordered a nightgown from the Vermont Country Store last year, she began to receive mail-order catalogs from National (their tagline: “Living the comfortable life since 1952″) and Woman Within. Struck by the models’ demure stances, she cut out certain images, before turning to her own fashion magazines and other periodicals. Last September, she asked Zosia Mamet to imitate the poses she had collected; the photographer Gus Powell shot. “Posturing” — inspired by the grids of the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann, illustrated workouts and 1970s yoga manuals (hence the unitard) — is one of the many projects in “Women in Clothes,” out this fall. Edited by Sheila Heti, Heidi Julavits and Shapton, the book explores the issues women face when they get dressed. According to Shapton, the photo series evokes the energetic, experimental spirit of the publication, which features over 600 contributors. “We wanted the reader to do exercises,” Shapton said. “Exercises for the critical eye.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/zosia-mamet-poses-leanne-shapton-women-in-clothes-book/

2014-06-16,What’s on Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE CONJURING (2013) Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, above, play Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life paranormal investigators who declared an infamous Dutch colonial-style house on Long Island haunted, leading to more than a dozen “Amityville” movies. Their target this time is a Rhode Island farmhouse, where the blissful dreams of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Tayor and Ron Livingston) and their five daughters become a moaning, creaking nightmare when they find themselves playing cat-and-mouse with an evil force. The director, James Wan, “smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “That gives the movie a shiver of political currency, even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, they’re facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that aren’t much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker. It’s here.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

(Starz Cinema) HELLO I MUST BE GOING (2012) A divorced 30-something (Melanie Lynskey) finds a haven from her adult problems in the suburban Connecticut home of her critical mother (Blythe Danner) and indulgent father (John Rubinstein) in this comedy written by Sarah Koskoff and directed by Todd Louiso. There, she finds sex and romance with the 19-year-old stepson (Christopher Abbott, above with Ms. Lynskey) of a potential client her father is desperate to impress, who has allowed his doting mother (Julie White) to believe he is gay. “Needless to say, there are complications, some farcical, some belonging more to the realm of therapeutic melodrama,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “This is ultimately a tale of affirmation, self-acceptance and second chances, and its lessons, while not unwelcome, are a bit too forced and neatly packaged to make it fully satisfying. But when Ms. Lynskey and Mr. Abbott are together, there are inklings of a wilder, riskier, less predictable movie — one you may wish the characters could escape into, even though you know they never will.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

2014-06-17,Morning Agenda: Argentina’s Court Loss Buoys Creditors,"The Supreme Court on Monday handed two major defeats to the government of Argentina, which has been fighting with New York hedge funds over bonds that the country defaulted on in 2001. Along with putting Argentina at risk of another default, the setbacks could also make it harder in the future for a financially troubled country to cut a deal with its creditors to reduce its debt load, DealBook’s Peter Eavis writes. Argentina had asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s ruling that had required the country to pay back defaulted bonds held by the litigating hedge funds, known as holdouts.",Business Day,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/morning-agenda-argentinas-court-loss-buoys-creditors/

Lou Reed! How to follow up a partnership with the man who helped invent punk? Perhaps the only thing more punk than punk is the ethos of D.I.Y., and so today, the line — whose colorful, unisex shades have been sported by Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Cara Delevingne — is unveiling a new custom sunglasses service. Using Illesteva’s website, users can select one of three frame styles, then choose from up to eight colors for the fronts and sides and match them up with one of up to nine lens varieties, including a polarized option. Like all of the brand’s offerings, the shades will be made in Italy or France. “I’ve never seen this offered in sunglasses before. I’m interested to see what color ways people will come up with,” says Daniel Silberman, the brand’s co-owner and designer. His decision to hand control over to his customers comes down to one of punk’s main tenets: self-expression. “Everyone wants to feel like they have something unique,” he says, “something that someone else doesn’t have.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/illesteva-sunglasses-custom-diy/

2014-06-18,The Democrats United?,"Vox’s Matthew Yglesias, seconded by my colleague Paul Krugman, has written a seven-point response to my argument that the Democratic coalition is more fragile, and more dependent on Hillary Clinton’s unique strengths, than many people (mostly liberals) tend to think. Yglesias’s rebuttal focuses on the Democratic Party’s apparent lack of deep policy divisions, which he regards as the main reason why there’s so little opposition to Clinton at the moment. “It is impossible,” he writes, “to mount a coherent anti-Clinton campaign because there is no issue that divides the mass of Democrats.” There’s no equivalent of the intra-Democrat war over the Iraq War that gave us Dean v. Kerry and than Obama v. Clinton; the neoliberal/populist debate over Wall Street is muddled and complicated; there’s unanimity on the need to tackle inequality; the education reform debate is real but doesn’t matter enough at the federal level to shape presidential politics; and the party’s demographic diversity coexists with increasing ideological conformity. Then as his parting point, he notes that polarization and partisan rancor make it hard to imagine either political coalition truly dissolving any time soon: The collapses of the past, “where one party’s candidate gets utterly blown away … simply can’t happen under modern conditions.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/the-democrats-united/

So sick with scurvy that he can scarcely lift his head from his pillow — let alone pull a loaded sledge — Shackleton is ordered back to England, forced to abandon Robert Falcon Scott’s Discovery expedition. But he is determined to return to the Antarctic, despite his wife’s entreaties (“The children are growing so quickly”!) and the claims of common sense. Though it’s easy to miss in Bertozzi’s telling, Shackleton went back about 5 years later, leading the Nimrod expedition, which came within 97 miles of reaching the South Pole. He managed to secure funding for a third attempt in August 1914, on the eve of the First World War.

But that’s pure hindsight, and looking forward most of the strategic options being discussed look somewhat fantastical, from the invasion 2.0 favored by the editors of The Weekly Standard (in which “special operators, and perhaps regular U.S. military units” would rout ISIS, and then somehow re-join together what Maliki has very deliberately put asunder) to the ally-with-Tehran option advanced as the thinking internationalist’s alternative (which even its advocates acknowledge requires lending U.S. resources to the cause of a “strengthened expansionary Iran”), to the “targeted” air strikes reportedly being contemplated by the administration (which, as a certain general with some in-theater experience just pointed out, would risk turning the U.S. military into “the air force for Shia militias”).",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/iraq-under-a-colder-eye/

At the Agi & Sam after-party, Black Rob’s 2000 track “Whoa” got everyone (including fellow designer Matthew Miller) onto the dance floor.

The structures not only carry you efficiently from place to place, he believes, but they also create a special state of mind that, borrowing a phrase from the French sociologist Roger Caillois, he likes to describe as “voluptuous panic.” On Wednesday, Mr. Holler unveiled his first free-standing slide on the campus of the furniture company Vitra in Weil am Rhein, Germany. It is a steel spiral descending from a 100-foot-high tower with a platform that offers a rare elevated view of the architectural masterworks around it. (Among the neighbors are buildings by Álvaro Siza, Tadao Ando and Zaha Hadid.) Topping the structure is a large, numberless clock that is positioned askew so that viewers must tilt their heads and guess the correct time. Mr. Holler prefers that idea to consulting a cellphone, a gesture that can be construed as rude. “People think you could be checking your email,” he said.

Hamas, the militant faction that has ruled Gaza from 2007 until the formation of a Palestinian unity government this month, has long stored weapons in tunnels.

Instead, the party’s armed wing said that the men were killed “while carrying out their jihadist duty in one of the resistance tunnels.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-blast-kills-5-militants.html

In the past few months, Egyptian courts have drawn international condemnation by issuing hundreds of death sentences against Brotherhood members and supporters after rushed trials that have relied on questionable evidence. On Thursday, the court referred the cases of Mohamed Badie, above, the Brotherhood’s spiritual leader, and 13 other people to Egypt’s highest religious authority, in what is seen as the first step in confirming the death sentences. Mr. Badie was also sentenced to death in April, in an unrelated case, but he is entitled to a retrial because the sentence was passed in absentia. In the latest trial, Mr. Badie and other senior leaders, including Essam el-Erian and Mohamed el-Beltagy, faced charges that included inciting murder during violence in Cairo last August.

Portraying the evil Polio, Balanchine enveloped Ms. Le Clercq in a black cape, rendering her character paralyzed. After children tossed dimes at her character, she arose. In 1956, by then the wife of Balanchine and a muse to Jerome Robbins, Ms. Le Clercq, 27, contracted polio while touring with the New York City Ballet in Copenhagen. Paralyzed from the waist down, she never danced again. Through interviews with her colleagues Jacques d’Amboise and Arthur Mitchell and others, this “American Masters” documentary, directed by Nancy Buirski, chronicles the life of Ms. Le Clercq (1929-2000), the inspiration behind Balanchine’s “Symphonie Concertante,” “Symphony in C,” “Bourrée Fantasque” and “La Valse” and Robbins’s “Afternoon of a Faun.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

Still, he was soon spending a candlelit evening with Yeats in the poet’s curtained rooms, having come to the attention of that “stormy petrel” Ezra Pound, who lauded him in reviews back home.

2014-06-20,The Wordy Shipmate,"When Geoff Dyer came aboard the U.S.S. George H. W. Bush for his 14-day stay, he had his Ping-Pong paddle securely stowed but had misplaced his notebook. Too tall, spindly, self-described as “a leftover from a novel Graham Greene had decided not to write,” he had managed through a stubbornness born of sheer neurotic panic to wheedle his way, despite considerable and justified resistance from the United States Navy, into private quarters on the giant but very crowded vessel: the Vice-Presidential Room, no less. His report of his first day on board is a nonstop string of complaints: The noise is unbearable, he keeps knocking his head on the low ceilings and hatches, the spaghetti is cold and the lettuce inedible, the oil fumes are overwhelming, the temperature is like a blast furnace, the air is toxic, the ocean glitters but is spoiled by a sky greased with jet fuel.

2014-06-20,Inside the List,"Turkey Stuffing: Diana Gabaldon’s hefty new novel, “Written in My Own Heart’s Blood” — the eighth entry in her Outlander series of time-traveling romances — enters the hardcover fiction list right at No. 1. These books describe the escapades of an 18th-century Scotsman and the World War II-era English nurse who fell into his world courtesy of a witches’ coven; writing in Salon in 1999, the critic Gavin McNett called it “the smartest historical sci-fi adventure-romance story ever written by a science Ph.D. with a background in scripting ‘Scrooge McDuck’ comics.” It’s been five years since the last Outlander title hit stores, and with a new Starz TV show based on the series coming in August, fans are primed for the latest installment. Gabaldon answered their questions recently on the website Goodreads. “People often say to me, ‘You write such strong female characters,’ ” she told one reader who praised the depiction of her heroine, “and I say, ‘Well, I don’t like stupid women.’ ” Gabaldon also cited her belief that fiction has three kinds of characters: mushrooms, hard nuts and onions. It’s a theory she’s expanded on at her official website. Onions, she explains, “develop slowly through the addition of multiple layers of personality, rather than popping up full-fledged as the ‘mushrooms’ do.” Hard nuts, meanwhile, play a merely functional role, making them difficult to animate. “Onions, mushrooms and nuts,” Gabaldon writes; “this is beginning to sound like an exotic recipe for turkey stuffing.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But in the spring/summer 2015 collections so far, looser, longer jeans silhouettes are on the rise. Unlike the baggy low-riders of the hip-hop ’90’s, the new crop of wide-legged jeans is surprisingly understated. At the E.Tautz show in London, the designer Patrick Grant offered a version that was dark-washed, cuffed and slightly high waisted. (He sported a pair for his bow.) Worn monochromatically with a tucked shirt and long mac coat, the runway look was put-together but relaxed. Margaret Howell, who continues to show strong collections of covetable basics, also introduced a loose-fitting pair of jeans, which was topped with a simple shirt and coat. And Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, the duo behind Marques’Almeida, took a more youthful approach, fraying the pants’ hems and pairing them with an equally frayed top and coat that evoked a similarly laid-back minimalism, but with an edge.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/london-fashion-week-trend-wide-legged-jeans/

It is uttered by a doctor to a nurse after they have just assisted in a grueling home birth, an experience that is compared to the four-month battle in a muddy stretch of Picardy beginning on July 1, 1916, that was, at the time, the bloodiest episode of combat in human history, generating 60,000 casualties in a single day of fighting on the British side alone.

2014-06-23,Report Calls for Tracking Data on Stress Disorder,"The Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs Department should track their efforts to treat post-traumatic stress more carefully, to see how effective those efforts are, a government-sponsored report released Friday said.

It affirms the findings of a report published in 2012 that called for more careful tracking. The V.A. has tracked symptoms in some members given treatment, but it is not clear how many and whether those veterans are in fact improving, experts said. “Given that the D.O.D. and V.A. are responsible for serving millions of service members, families and veterans, we found it surprising that no PTSD outcome measures are used consistently to know if these treatments are working or not,” the chairman of the panel, Sandro Galea of Columbia University, said in a statement.

2014-06-23,Morning Views,"“There’s no escaping the conclusion that the stock market is not a level playing field where all investors, large and small, have an equal shot at a fair deal,” writes The New York Times editorial board. “The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations recently held a hearing on “maker-taker” pricing in which stock exchanges pay rebates to brokers for sending them buy-and-sell orders. The practice has been around for years, as a growing number of exchanges — there are now 11 public exchanges in the United States — have battled for business. What is new is the compelling evidence that the rebates are corrupting.” Brokers are technically supposed to find the best stock prices for their clients, but new research shows that they are “routinely sending orders to venues that paid the highest rebates.” The board calls on financial regulators to monitor executions, for the good of the American economy and maintaining fair competition: “Securities regulators clearly need to better enforce the best execution requirements on brokers, combined with better disclosure on brokers’ routing decisions and the rebates they earn. If Congress won’t provide more resources for enforcement, rebates need either to be passed along to the customer or eliminated altogether.”",Opinion,https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/morning-views-20/

2014-06-24,‘Orange Is the New Black’ Recap: It’s Valentine’s Day at the Litch,"Season 2, Episode 6 It’s Valentine’s Day, and love is in the air at the Litch. Crazy, complicated prison love, making it not so much different from love everywhere else. This episode has an almost giddy looseness to it, with dialogue and scenes bleeding into one another – from prison staff into inmates, from Litchfield into Larry’s Brooklyn (Larry – “my sweet, kind, unfocused fiancé,” as Piper describes him). The looseness conveys the messiness of the business at hand – as do the closeups of inmates giving their definitions of love to an off-camera interviewer. (Who turns out to be Piper, with an interest in interviewing that is somewhat duplicitous. More on that below, and while it’s not really much of a spoiler, this is probably a good place to issue the standard spoiler alert.)",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-its-valentines-day-at-the-litch/

2014-06-25,Iran: Harvard Scholar’s Body Cremated After Request for Burial in Iran Falters," Richard Nelson Frye, a renowned Harvard scholar who wanted to be buried in Iran, a request that angered Iranian hard-liners, has been cremated by his family in Boston, the Iranian news media reported Tuesday. The Iranian Students’ News Agency quoted Dr. Frye’s Iranian colleague Turaj Daryaii as saying the family had waited more than two months for official Iranian permission to bury him in Isfahan, the ancient capital of the Persian Empire, before deciding to cremate him on June 8. It was not clear what the family intended to do with his ashes. Dr. Frye, who died on March 27 at age 94, had dedicated his career to Iran’s culture and language, and he had written the burial request into his will. He was widely regarded in Iran as a friend, even among some conservatives, but his death coincided with growing resentment by Iranian hard-liners over signs of reconciliation with the United States after decades of estrangement. A month after Dr. Frye died, the leader of Friday Prayer in Isfahan denounced his burial request, calling him a spy and a robber of cultural artifacts.

2014-06-25,France: Court Rules on End-of-Life Case,"France’s highest administrative court, the Conseil d’État, ruled Tuesday that a feeding tube could legally be removed from a 38-year-old man in a persistent vegetative state, whose care has been part of a long, bitter public fight involving the country’s end-of-life legislation. Before a 2008 accident left the man, Vincent Lambert, a former psychiatric nurse, paralyzed and unresponsive, he had repeatedly said he did not wish to be kept alive in such a condition, according to his wife and several family members, who have sought for him to be allowed to die. Given that, the court found that the feeding tube that has kept Mr. Lambert alive could be considered “unreasonable” medical “obstinacy,” and could be legally removed. Mr. Lambert’s parents, who oppose that, have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, and Mr. Lambert will be kept alive during the months or years of that court’s examination of the case. French law prohibits any medical acts explicitly intended to end a patient’s life, but authorizes doctors to withdraw treatment or administer lethal doses of painkillers under certain circumstances.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/europe/france-court-rules-on-end-of-life-case.html

2014-06-25,"Malaria Prevention, With Both Reward and Risk","Alassane Dicko shivered and sweated through part of his childhood. Sick with frequent bouts of malaria, he often missed school. His older brother died of malaria, and so did his best friend. This disease can be cured with a pill, yet it claims about 1,700 lives each day — mainly children in sub-Saharan Africa who don’t take this medicine within a week of falling sick. Even when kids survive, some remain disabled or irrecoverably behind in school. That’s why Dicko, now a malaria researcher at the University of Bamako in Mali, took matters into his own hands when he became a father.Dicko gives malaria medicine to his children before they get the disease during the rainy season — the period when the mosquito-borne illness peaks in Mali. Tourists do something similar by taking malaria drugs prophylactically on trips to Africa, but for decades, health officials have said that Africans should not do so, because the widespread use of a drug eventually renders that drug ineffective. However, Dicko, who studies malaria prevention, has come to believe that the immediate health benefits are worth that risk.After a decade of clinical trials demonstrated that the preventive measure reduces malaria cases by 75 percent, medical authorities reversed their position against it, in areas where it’s most effective. They decided that the number of lives saved outweighs the cost of losing these drugs eventually. “For every drug you give, you will increase the risk of drug resistance,” Dicko says. “But these drugs are efficacious right now, so why don’t we use them and save thousands of lives?”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/malaria-prevention-with-both-reward-and-risk/

Of particular interest is Jon Vickers in the title role. Here, Vickers is early in his career before it became clear that he would be the great dramatic tenor of his generation, bringing a powerhouse voice and expressive intensity to roles like Wagner’s Tristan and Verdi’s Otello. This is Vickers in a more youthful, lyric mode, but still singing with chilling power and ardency, despite occasional moments of strain in his high range. The cast boasts Gré Brouwenstijn as Elisabetta, Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo, Fedora Barbieri as Eboli, and Boris Christoff as Filippo II. The great Carlo Maria Giulini conducts a majestic account of the score. The performance comes through cleanly on this remastered recording.

Marc Jacobs, whose collection featured cool interpretations of pastels and flamingo imagery, showed a shirt and tie, both in a pink fern print, under a dusty rose checked suit that somehow still maintained an edge. The Z Zegna show, which was at Pitti Uomo in Florence this season, displayed a smart balance of athletic wear and fine Italian tailoring.

2014-06-26,Stretching to Infinity and Beyond,"Since 1996, the New York designer David Weeks has been turning out furniture, lighting, toys and even wallpaper with gorilla heads. His latest project, the Infinity Screen, is a series of interlocking four-by-six-inch paper modules that can grow to any dimension. The piece came about when the W Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., commissioned Mr. Weeks to design a light installation that required no electricity. He used die-cut paper coated in shiny Mylar to create a fixture that resembled a chandelier. When the project was done, he decided to explore other uses for the technique. “It was an exercise in form,” he said. The panels ($250 a square yard) are made of card stock paper and can be used as a room divider or window covering. A stainless-steel mounting bracket is $150 per 36-inch length. Mr. Weeks will produce the screen in other materials or in printed versions for custom projects.

Often made with scavenged wood mixed with raw lumber straight from the yard, the buildings were designed by Marcel Breuer, Eero Saarinen, Serge Chermayeff, Maurice Smith and serious amateurs. In this rich cultural setting, left-leaning figures including Mary McCarthy, Edmund Wilson, Dwight Macdonald and Noam Chomsky dined on plywood tables, bathed nude in brisk waters on principle and exercised elastic morals among the unpainted two-by-fours. It was a summer camp for consenting, distinctly un-Puritanical intellectuals. And the party needn’t be over. Many of the houses are in the Cape Cod National Seashore conservation park, with some recently restored for summer rental and for artists in the off-season.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/garden/rustic-raw-and-thoroughly-modern.html

But the main reason that the group burst onto the scene in a flash of eight mostly vivid colors, including a blue inspired by the palette of the Hotel Condesa in Mexico City, had to do with their bulbs. Niche Modern’s existing lamps offered few options for low-energy bulbs, or for the 240-volt varieties used overseas, where the company has been brightening a growing number of hotels and restaurants. The Crystalline series will accommodate both models of the stylish Plumen compact fluorescent light bulb, as well as Niche Modern’s specialty incandescent bulb.

2014-06-26,Marco Rubio Raises the Bar,"Before I continue with my string of posts on the theme of reform conservatism’s correct views on everything, let me make a brief foray into real-world politics: Yesterday Senator Marco Rubio gave a domestic policy speech, co-hosted by Hillsdale College and the YG Network, that’s worth reading if you’re interested in what a reformist vision looks like when it’s an actual Republican politician (rather than a tribe of conservative scribblers) giving it form and substance. Naturally, it strikes me as a very impressive and encouraging speech. But I think I would say that even if I were less inclined to agree with its policy specifics, because purely as a rhetorical matter, it does something that Mitt Romney didn’t manage to do in 2012 until, well, basically the first presidential debate: That is, it tries to meet non-conservative voters where they are and talk about the issues that they say they care about, rather than lecturing them on what they should be concerned about (too few people are paying income tax! Obama doesn’t like entrepreneurs!) and assuming that they’re already persuaded. It’s a speech rooted in conservative principle without being trapped by the conservative talking points, in other words, and that’s something we saw very little of in the 2012 campaign.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/marco-rubio-raises-the-bar/

2014-06-27,Troubled Inquisitor,"Political novels are full of pitfalls, particularly for a novelist with strong political leanings. Writers may craft their world however they like, so they need not deal with the complexities of reality if it inconveniences their narrative. Ayn Rand’s philosophy can work in “Atlas Shrugged,” for example, because it’s a fantasyland of her creation. A better approach can be found in “The Brothers Karamazov,” in which Dostoyevsky makes his ideological opponents his most articulate characters. Great writers force themselves to confront the challenges the world can throw against what they believe. The poet Tom Sleigh explains this as “the difference between exploring a political emotion, say, rather than a political conviction.” Whereas a political emotion is concerned with the lived experience of how politics impact people’s lives, a political conviction is primarily didactic — it “weaves no web, traps no chaotically buzzing flies — it’s hygienic, and easily put aside when the moment of outrage or conversational animus has passed.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/dave-eggerss-your-fathers-where-are-they-and-the-prophets-do-they-live-forever.html

She hung out with an older African-American food service worker at the university, and one thing led to another. Before long, she had moved into an apartment in a poor, largely black neighborhood in Philadelphia, her housemate a young man whose family lived down the block. Goffman became such a part of the fabric of the community that she was harassed by the police, witnessed someone getting pistol-whipped, was even set up on a blind date. And all the while she was furiously taking notes, trying to make sense of what at first glance appeared to be utter chaos going on around her.

(Starz) BLUE JASMINE (2013) Cate Blanchett, above, won an Oscar for her role as Jasmine French, a Park Avenue matron fallen on hard times after her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), lands in prison for bilking his clients out of millions — leaving her with little more than her pearls, white Chanel jacket, Hermès bag and monogrammed Louis Vuitton luggage. Destitute, in a manner of speaking, Jasmine flies first-class to San Francisco to begin life anew with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), whose scrappy existence and brutish men (Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale) Jasmine can barely stomach without self-medicating with vodka and Xanax. Then she meets a diplomatic type (Peter Sarsgaard) with an appreciation for her decorating talents and designer threads, and starts to see light at the end of her terribly dark tunnel. With intimations of Ruth Madoff and Blanche DuBois, this shattered woman is “brilliantly brought to quivering life by Ms. Blanchett,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, in Woody Allen’s “most sustained, satisfying and resonant film since ‘Match Point.’ ” What did Jasmine know about her husband’s unscrupulous business dealings, and when did she know it? “These questions come to haunt ‘Blue Jasmine,’ and as the past catches up with the present, they help drive this moving, sometimes funny film toward its shattering end,” Ms. Dargis added.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

(In 1961, her Santa Barbara caretaker quit because he was suffering from the isolation: Clark had reportedly not visited the place since 1953.)

But she could do without the distractions of fame; that’s why she adopted the pseudonym Robert Galbraith for her Cormoran Strike crime series, also projected to last seven volumes. (“The Silkworm,” the second entry in the series, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2, while its predecessor, “The Cuckoo’s Calling,” is No. 8 on the trade paperback list.) “When I ‘unmasked’ myself to my editor,” Rowling says on the official Robert Galbraith website, “one of the first things he said was ‘I never would have thought a woman wrote that.’ Apparently I had successfully channeled my inner bloke!” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Coming on the heels of the relentless rise of the Aperol Spritz, these new, lighter drinks appeal as much to those with an aversion to strong liquors as they do to the heartiest of drinkers after one dirty martini too many. And as Dinah Sanders, author of “The Art of the Shim: Low-Alcohol Cocktails to Keep you Level,” says, “The more subtle ingredients these drinks often feature don’t overwhelm the palate, so they are generally more food-friendly.” Thanks to exotic sakes, a variety of vermouths, a growing range of bitters, flavorful teas, infused syrups, fresh herbs and wines of all colors and ranges of effervescence, the sky’s the limit in creating easier-to-drink concoctions, as evidenced in the following five recipes.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/cocktail-culture-inventive-low-proof-cocktails-sake-wine-vermouth/

2014-06-30,What’s on Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE COUNSELOR (2013) Michael Fassbender (above right, with Brad Pitt) portrays the title character — a corrupt, high-flying Texas lawyer who gets in over his head in a drug deal with Reiner (Javier Bardem), a nightclub owner involved with a Mexican cartel promising a 4,000 percent return — in this thriller directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Cormac McCarthy. Mr. Pitt is the Counselor’s wary business associate, Cameron Diaz is Reiner’s predatory girlfriend and Penélope Cruz is the woman the Counselor intends to marry. “From all the ellipses, as well as the eccentric, mesmerizing poetry of his dialogue, Mr. McCarthy appears to have never read a screenwriting manual in his life. (That’s a compliment; this is his first produced film script.),” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about what she called a “terrifying, implacable new movie.” In Mr. McCarthy, she added, Mr. Scott “has found a partner with convictions about good and evil rather than canned formula.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2014-06-30,1914: Assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand was a conspiracy," VIENNA — That the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the thrones of Austria and Hungary, and of the Duchess of Hohenberg, his consort, was the result of a widespread plot, the extent of which the actual actors were perhaps unaware of, now appears to be beyond doubt. In case the attempt on the Archduke’s life in Sarajevo failed, other bombs, it is stated, were to have been exploded on the railway as the Royal train was on its return journey from the Bosnian capital. Serious disturbances have taken place in Sarajevo and other towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yesterday, another bomb was thrown at a street corner in Sarajevo by a young man, a Mussulman being wounded by the explosion. Martial law has been proclaimed in the town. The bodies of Archduke Francis Ferdinand and the Duchess of Hohenberg were embalmed during Sunday night, and were removed yesterday by special train to Metkovich, Dalmatia, on their way to Vienna. The funeral will take place on Friday, the interment being in the mausoleum on the Archduke’s estate at Artstetten. Emperor Francis Joseph will not be present at this ceremony, but will attend a requiem mass on the following day. A representative of a Prague bank in which Archduke Francis Ferdinand’s will had been deposited has arrived in Vienna with the document. It is stated that certain questions of State in which the Archduke was interested will be confided by the Emperor to the new heir to the throne. — From The New York Herald, European Edition, June 30, 1914.",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/1914-assassination-of-the-archduke-francis-ferdinand-was-a-conspiracy/

2014-06-30,What’s On Sunday,"10 P.M. (HBO) THE LEFTOVERS Three years after 2 percent of the world’s population suddenly disappeared on Oct. 14, for no discernible reason — Was it an act of God? A natural phenomenon? — the residents of the fictional Mapleton, N.Y., are still searching for answers in this dystopian series created by Tom Perrotta, adapted from his novel, and Damon Lindelof, a mastermind behind ABC’s “Lost.” Churches have closed while cults have formed, including the Guilty Remnant, whose followers wear white, take a vow of silence and chain smoke. One member is Laurie (Amy Brenneman), the mother of Jill (Margaret Qualley), a high schooler, and Tom (Chris Zylka), who has joined another cult led by a man who claims that he can hug the pain out of people. Laurie is also the wife of Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux, the town’s chief of police, above, speaking with Amanda Warren), whose colleagues worry that he may be losing his mind as he tries to maintain order. The show “may never explain what happened to the people who disappeared, but the measure of its worth is that it may not have to,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “As with any good drama, the mystery lies in human nature more than in the supernatural. Once the show gets going, and it takes more than one episode to do so, ‘The Leftovers’ bores into the characters and the fissures that crack their community so astutely that the cause is almost secondary.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

Plans are to add 30 to 50 items a month to the site, where they will tell a story that fans might not otherwise see, Mr. Crane said by phone on Sunday from Israel. “For a Bruce fan, this gives you insight into your hero and the way he grew up,” he said. Among the items is an eighth-grade report card, above right, featuring mostly low grades, including D’s in composition, physical education and music. The young Springsteen “didn’t have a great time in Catholic school,” Mr. Crane said. “He wasn’t allowed to be who he wanted to be and to express himself.” Mr. Crane said his favorite item is a photo of Mr. Springsteen and his father on a 1972 visit to Mexico. “Bruce has described their relationship as tumultuous,” Mr. Crane said, “so it’s cool to see Bruce as just a kid laughing with his dad.” Admission is $9.99, which allows a month of access to the site, the ability to download a font that replicates Mr. Springsteen’s handwriting style, the use of a ticket and memorabilia exchange, and entry to a monthly raffle.

He took me on a late-night tour there in March, while I was interviewing him for my article about his political recovery in last Sunday’s magazine. ‘‘It doesn’t look like much, but it was pretty hard,’’ Sanford told me. ‘‘It’s not an advanced building by any stretch of the imagination.’’ Inside, the cabin is packed with items from Sanford’s political rise and fall and his family life.
