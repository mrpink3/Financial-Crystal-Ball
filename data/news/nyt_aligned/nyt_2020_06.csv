But how many feature a boy becoming a man in an instant? The boy here is Billy (Asher Angel), a teenage orphan who is given magic powers that allow him to transform into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) by saying the word “shazam.” His character is based on a lesser-known DC superhero created in 1939 — but the movie’s blasé humor is very contemporary. It’s “a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes,” she added. “But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens, it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-shazam-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood.html

The conceit is that Gameau, an Australian actor, envisions an auspicious future in the year 2040 for his daughter. He imagines a world where the existential threats of climate change have been curtailed, using only technologies that exist today.

Yet, when eco-conscious sponsors were beginning to steer away from Formula 1 cars, which have the miles per gallon of a military tank, Agag co-founded Formula E, a full-throttle racing series that involves pitting electric cars against one another in competitions from Hong Kong to Marrakesh.

2020-06-05,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Yourself and Yours’ and ‘Circumstantial Pleasures’,"YOURSELF AND YOURS (2020) Watch on virtual cinemas. Alcohol and love infuse “Yourself and Yours,” a new movie from the South Korean filmmaker Hong Sang-soo. It kicks off with a breakup: Young-soo (Kim Ju-hyuk) tells Min-jung (Lee Yoo-young), his girlfriend, to quit drinking. She quits him instead. The plot that follows involves mystery and despondency. “Hong’s formal confidence yields a movie that’s very simply constructed and utterly engrossing,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. He named the film a Critic’s Pick. “There are a lot of scenes done in a single shot, usually static, but when there’s a zoom (his preferred camera flourish), it’s unfussy and direct,” Kenny wrote. “He puts you in tune with the world of his sad-sack characters immediately, and their rhythm becomes the rhythm of the story.” The film was released overseas in 2016, but is just now having its stateside debut; it’s available this weekend from many virtual cinemas, including Film at Lincoln Center’s.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-we-are-freestyle-love-supreme-circumstantial-pleasures.html

The Exfoliating Bar ($15), from Hanahana Beauty, which is based in Chicago and Accra, Ghana, can be used on even the most sensitive skin. The blend of adzuki beans, almonds and rice sloughs away dead skin cells, while shea butter (ethically sourced from Ghana), cocoa butter and avocado oil leaves the body soft and moisturized.

Fred (Logan Lerman) and Rose (Odessa Young), a young couple, are offered to stay with Shirley (Elisabeth Moss) and her husband Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), a professor and literary critic, at their house in Vermont. But the arrangement slowly starts to feel like a trap. Stanley treats Fred as a professional grunt, while Shirley sees Rose as a muse for her next novel. The movie isn’t factual — the filmmaker Josephine Decker (“Madeline’s Madeline”) drew from the novel of the same name by Susan Scarf Merrell. But the formula works. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that “Shirley is a mystery and a monster, and ‘Shirley’ is at once a sincere tribute and a sly hatchet job.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-shirley-and-yvonne-orji.html

Since the death of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, many people have turned to social media in search of resources that can explain the underlying issues that have fueled the activism we see today. One such resource that has resurfaced is this documentary, which is streaming for free through June 12. In the 1960s, Swedish journalists came to the United States to explore the nascent black power movement. They interviewed political activists including Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale, as well as residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland. About 30 years later, their footage was discovered by a Swedish television network, and the director Goran Hugo Olsson pieced clips together to create this film. He also added voice-over commentary by contemporary figures, like Erykah Badu and Questlove, who explain the movement’s relevance decades later. The movie is by no means a comprehensive overview of the era, but a telling take from an outsider’s perspective.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-the-black-power-mixtape-and-the-last-og.html

In ancient Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied (and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers and samurai took it up in the 16th century. Of course, incense also just smells nice, its scent hanging in the room even after the physical material has burned to a tidy pile of ash. But protection and cleanliness feel like particularly appealing aims right now, as does the idea of creating a ritual, and thus imposing a modicum of regularity and intention amid so much uncertainty.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/t-magazine/best-incense.html

A hit man, a jazz trumpeter and a vampire are among the characters in this latest movie from the Canadian filmmaker Bruce McDonald (“Pontypool”). Part absurdist comedy, part noirish horror fable, “Dreamland” assigns its hit man, Johnny Dead Eyes (Stephen McHattie), a gruesome task: cut off the right pinkie finger of a drug-addled trumpeter (also played by McHattie) before he’s due to play a high-profile concert hosted by a criminal known as the Countess (Juliette Lewis), whose shady dealings include involvement in sex trafficking. Chaos ensues, naturally. Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic’s Pick, calling it “strange, challenging and boundlessly confident” in her review in The New York Times. “Gathering the living, the dead and the undead together on a single, surreal plane,” she wrote, “the movie turns its sordid, sex-trafficking plot into a decadent, redemptive fairy tale.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-dreamland-oprah.html

Indeed, this historic rebellion is the reason we celebrate Pride Month each June. But as America rages on — against an uncured pandemic as well as its aftereffects, and for justice following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others at the hands of police — that phrase, “Stonewall was a riot,” has taken on new resonance: It’s an assertion that fighting, not partying, is the root of our story. And this year, as many join in protests chanting “Black lives matter,” we are reminded that the Stonewall liberation was led by trans women of color, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two activists whom city officials decided last year to honor with a monument, after decades of progress being too often attributed to mostly white gay men.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/t-magazine/pride-month-reading-list.html

This documentary by the director John Ridley (“American Crime”) was released on the 25th anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. ABC is resurfacing it — with a new introduction by John Legend — as police brutality and institutional racism consume the nation following the death of George Floyd. The movie traces the decade leading up to the riots, a response to a verdict that acquitted four police officers of assault for the beating of Rodney King. Ridley argues that King’s case was the straw that broke the camel’s back in a city rife with political and racial tensions. He backs his claim with nuance, interviewing retired police officials, witnesses and victims and perpetrators of violence. In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis named the movie a Critic’s Pick, calling it “wrenchingly humane.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-let-it-fall-and-one-day-at-a-time.html

Directed by Ivy Meeropol, this documentary airs a day before the anniversary of the execution of her grandparents, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, at Sing Sing prison for espionage in 1953. A prosecutor in their case was a young Roy Cohn, whose involvement quickly led Senator Joseph McCarthy — a staunch anti-communist Republican — to appoint Cohn to his chief counsel. There, Cohn played a major role in expelling government officials thought to be communists or gay, and shortly thereafter he became a personal lawyer to then-businessman Donald J. Trump. Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986. With newly discovered material from Cohn’s career as a power broker, this film aims to expose the life and death of this menacing public figure.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-story-of-roy-cohn-taste-the-nation.html

Our arches are no less important today and indeed seem to have become newly conspicuous during the past several months, exposed above our face masks or reflected back at us during Zoom calls. “I consider eyebrow grooming to be an art, and there are many ways of going about it,” says Jimena Garcia, a brow sculptor and specialist at Atelier Beauté Chanel in New York City, who, along with many others in her field, has started offering virtual consultations for clients. But no matter how advanced your instruction, fine-tuning your brows at home requires a bit of firsthand experience — and restraint (the temptation to over-pluck is the greatest challenge, Garcia cautions). In the end, the result should be both an expression of your personal style and a shape that best complements your features, she says.

Jacques Rivette’s film from the early 1970s is difficult to summarize, in part because it revolves around the question of whether or not plots actually exist. The main story threads — two separate theater troupes rehearsing different plays by the Greek tragedian Aeschylus: one about a young man hunting for a secret society called the Thirteen; the other about a canny hustler who stumbles across the shadowy cabal — are woven together only to be unraveled. The conspiracy that Colin (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is seeking to uncover, which Frédérique (Juliet Berto) discovers by accident, is similarly ambiguous. It appears to exist — Frédérique seems to find correspondence between its members, and several avowed participants appear in the film — but its power and status are unclear. This tension is never resolved, but over the course of the film’s more than 12 hours, it deepens and becomes more complex.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-out-1-penn-and-teller-fool-us.html

And although he’s most famous for his use of crushed-up cars and other junkyard parts, scrap iron having proved affordable when he was starting out and had little money, he also worked with polyurethane and newspaper — and even made jewelry. This month, Celine is reviving that lesser-known element of his practice with the launch of a roughly two-and-a-half-inch-tall version of one of César’s compression pendants: a rectangular column made up of small sheets and bands of metal that fold in and around each other in a gleaming maze.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/t-magazine/celine-cesar-jewelry.html

Everything is a bit worn, a bit out‐of‐date, a bit frayed. The only hints of deeper purpose are the color‐coded numbers hanging on strings from the ceiling. There’s the orange group, the yellow group, the white group. Each placard has a number and, beneath it, a picture of a single poker chip. The smell of stale casino air fills the room—old carpet; powder; a sweet, faintly sickly perfume; cold fried food and flat beer; and the unmistakable metallic tang of several thousand exhausted bodies that have been sharing the same space since morning.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/books/review/the-biggest-bluff-maria-konnikova-an-excerpt.html

In the evening, there are brined and smoked spatchcocked chickens, whole or half, with side dishes like potatoes cooked in the drippings, and he is also offering prix fixe ($15) “Friends & Family” meals prepared by guest chefs. The idea is to make dinner easy for locals and people with young children, like himself. “We’re two blocks from Prospect Park, so they can take the food and sit on a bench,” he said. His little place does not have seating, and, Mr. Eddy said, it is worth reserving the various set dinners as there are a limited number. There have been Korean meals on weekends from Amy Yi, who was at Upland, but that will change soon. (A barbecue menu starts the weekend of July 4.) The chef Ali Spahr handles pastry, and Kevin Bruce is on breads. Mr. Eddy also plans to open an intimate wine and cocktail bar next door.

After a couple years off, Dory and company are back, this time on HBO’s new streaming service (the show was on TBS). Season 3 includes a high-stakes criminal trial, chic clothes and cynicism. “‘Search Party,’ has always had a retro-tinged aesthetic, a slight thrift-store defect to its world, which makes it feel surreal at times — part of reality but not identical to it,” Margaret Lyons wrote in a recent edition of The New York Times’s Watching newsletter. “Teasing out the contrast between the weightlessness of an imagined, curated past and the cruel density of the flawed, lived past is one of the show’s most elegant tricks.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-search-party-and-the-twilight-zone.html
