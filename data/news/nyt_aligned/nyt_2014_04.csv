Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this Oscar winner for best foreign-language film “an attractive, messy drama riddled with violence and edged with comedy that comes with a hint of Grand Guignol, a suggestion of politics and three resonant, deeply appealing performances.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

This recording pairs the ebullient Second Concerto, which can often sound like an audacious extension of Haydn, with the noble, and mercurial, Fourth Concerto, in which Beethoven takes the genre into realms of the poetic and the mystical. In these elegant, vibrant performances, Mr. Andsnes intriguingly reveals the magisterial qualities of the earlier work and the classical directness of the later one. He does double-duty as pianist and conductor, drawing impressive playing from the remarkable Mahler Chamber Orchestra.

Patient information will remain private. “Data like these can shine a light on how care is delivered in the Medicare program,” said Jonathan Blum, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a blog post. “They can help consumers compare the services provided and payments received by individual health care providers. Businesses and consumers alike can use these data to drive decision-making and reward quality, cost-effective care.” Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly, was prevented from releasing information on individual physicians until a ruling last year by a federal judge in Florida. In a statement issued by the A.M.A., the medical group raised concerns that Medicare’s broad release of the payment information could “mislead the public” and recommended that doctors be allowed to review and correct any information before it was made public.

The international court’s ruling said that the scientific output from Japan’s whaling program “to date appears limited” and suggested that the hunt was continued because of politics and logistics, rather than science.

2014-04-03,What’s on Thursday,"6:15 P.M. (MoreMax) MUNICH (2005) Steven Spielberg ventures beyond this story’s historical impetus — the 1972 Olympics, at which 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by members of a Palestinian group known as Black September — to create a philosophical thriller about its aftermath: Israel’s apparent campaign of vengeance, using five agents who crisscrossed Europe to hunt suspects for years. Eric Bana portrays the film’s moral center, a former Mossad agent sent on a mission to eliminate those responsible for the deaths. Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Hanns Zischler and Mathieu Kassovitz (above left with Mr. Zischler) play his team. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth wrote the screenplay, based on a book by George Jonas. “An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ‘Munich’ is by far the toughest film of the director’s career and the most anguished,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. But more than anything, she added, “ ‘Munich’ is a slammin’ entertainment filled with dazzling set pieces and geometric camerawork.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

It’s also a microcosm of the art industry, offering a range of current product, a ton of junk and some stimulating work. Apart from a few outlier galleries, its main boundaries have stayed consistent: 17th Street to 27th Street, 10th to 11th Avenues. Here, you’ll find some of the largest commercial art spaces in town, possibly on earth; multisite franchises (Gagosian, Matthew Marks, David Zwirner); and a handful of reliably ambitious small galleries, which show some of the best work. Art district, not art neighborhood, most accurately describes this area, though that’s changing. Apartment buildings are going up, along with the new Whitney Museum.

2014-04-04,Broadcast News: British Airhead Still Has a Platform,"Can unpleasantness be its own kind of charm? The British comedian and actor Steve Coogan has built a career around the answer “well yes, sort of.” American audiences that know him for his uncharacteristically sweet turn in “Philomena” or his role as the miniature Roman soldier in “Night at the Museum” movies may have a distorted view of his talents. As a character named “Steve Coogan” (in “The Trip” and elsewhere), he has satirized the fragile vanity of the semicelebrity class. But his greatest creation may be a broadcaster named Alan Partridge, a man whose Wikipedia entry helpfully describes him as “an insecure, superficial and narcissistic ‘wally.’ ”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/movies/alan-partridge-starring-steve-coogan.html

As I’ve often argued, the problem with our inadequate and often perverse response to mass unemployment isn’t that we lack a workable economic framework; basic IS-LMish macroeconomics has, in fact, provided quite good guidance.The problem, instead, has been that following economic logic has been deemed unserious. Serious people want balanced budgets and price stability, never mind what the textbooks say. This has among other things led to the peculiar result that respectable people grab on to academic papers that present dubious nonstandard results — expansionary austerity! A debt cliff at 90 percent! — while radicals like me are the ones citing Econ 101.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/euphemistic-at-the-imf/

For all the statehouse flirtation with creationism, 43 states have dared to proclaim official fossils — the Triceratops in South Dakota, the saber-toothed cat in California, the duck-billed dinosaur in Montana. It seemed appropriate that South Carolina would finally join the march forward with an extinct creature called the Columbian woolly mammoth, since it was the site of one of the earliest North American digs to uncover ancient mammoth tooth fossils, in 1725.A bill to underline the state’s pride in its ancient resident moved quickly with the House’s blessing. But then Senator Kevin Bryant proposed an amendment rooted in the Book of Genesis, imputing God as the creator of the woolly mammoth: “And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.” The senator stirred up a familiar debate between firm believers in evolution and those who insist it should be devalued and taught as a “pro and con” theory.",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/in-south-carolina-celebrating-gods-own-wooly-mammoth/

2014-04-04,Suddenly That Summer,"Although a vicious crime serves as the grain of sand around which this pearl of a novel is formed, Linn Ullmann’s “The Cold Song” is not a crime story. Little concerned with villain, motives or detection of evidence, it doesn’t aim for a solution, for redemption or justice. And with a first chapter that begins, “Milla, or what was left of her, was found by Simen and two of his friends when they were digging for buried treasure in the woods,” it hardly seeks to maintain suspense about the identity or fate of the victim. Yet the novel — Ullmann’s fifth, translated from Norwegian by Barbara J. Haveland — is steeped in dread the way a fruitcake is steeped in rum: ­Every page, every line, seems to glisten with vapors of sumptuous, intoxicating unease.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/books/review/the-cold-song-by-linn-ullmann.html

2014-04-04,Inside the List,"Triple Threat: It’s tempting to be cynical, I know, when you come across another book by a rich and powerful person avowing that power and riches are, like, totally overrated and happiness is all that matters. And when that rich and powerful person is Arianna Huffington — whose media empire, The Huffington Post, is famous among other things for encouraging writers to work without pay — well, cynicism becomes downright unavoidable. (At least her message is consistent: Why pay contributors if money corrupts?) Huffington’s new book, “Thrive,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1, arguing that our obsession with wealth and status obscures the importance of mental well-being as the “third metric” of success. Basically, it’s a technocratic version of the old work-life equation, swathed in New Age incense: “Our breath,” Huffington declares early on, “also has a sacredness about it.” None of this means the book doesn’t make good points along the way, advising readers to sleep longer, take more walks and disengage every now and then from the digital world — including, presumably, from The Huffington Post. When Huffington appeared on “The Daily Show” recently, Jon Stewart seemed unsure what to make of her new persona. “I swear,” he said, “you’re like William Randolph Hearst and Martha Stewart and Oprah, all rolled together now.

Annette was a 15-year-old Jewish schoolgirl living in Paris when World War II began. As restrictions and fear mounted during the German occupation, she and her family hid for weeks in her best friend’s apartment; then, using borrowed identity cards, they traveled to a remote village where Annette spent the next two years disguised as a Roman Catholic, delivering messages and explosives for the French Resistance on her bicycle.

Leon tends to console herself by writing a new book. BY ITS COVER (Atlantic Monthly, $26), which finds the author in a fury over vandalism and theft in national libraries, museums and churches, appears to have been inspired by the looting of Naples’s Girolamini Library by its director, a systematic sacking of thousands of rare books that came to light in 2012. (“It would make a stone weep,” according to one of Brunetti’s colleagues.) Although the criminal damage done at the venerable Biblioteca Merula is on a far more modest scale, it’s no less heartbreaking to the library director, as well as to the commissario. It’s also a great mystery.

2014-04-04,The Devil’s Woods,"It’s tempting to say that “A Man Came Out of a Door in the Mountain,” the first novel by Adrianne Harun, is set in a “dead-end town” — indeed the book’s publicity copy employs the phrase. It’s useful shorthand, invoking a familiar image. The trouble with it is the fact that Harun, the author of a story collection, “The King of Limbo,” is not one bit interested in the familiar. Her nameless British Columbia logging outpost makes the dead-end town look benign and cozy, a cousin of the cul-de-sac.

2014-04-04,Never Hurts to Ask,"Regarding the pain of others requires more than just a pair of eyes. It necessitates an act of the imagination: a willingness to think or feel oneself into the interior of another’s experience, to cross between what Susan Sontag once designated as the kingdoms of the sick and of the well. This kind of empathetic border crossing can be both difficult and dangerous, the sort of journey of which one might say: “I get across quickly because I’m headed in the right direction, by which I mean the wrong direction. I’m going where no one wants to stay.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/books/review/the-empathy-exams-by-leslie-jamison.html

Unlike those riskier “rear window” views, streetfront views shed light primarily on the most predictable of daytime activities.

2014-04-04,Who Made That Black Box?,"Let’s get one thing clear: The “black box” isn’t black. It’s orange. Before airlines made that color standard for their flight recorders, some Boeings used a yellow sphere, and the British had a gizmo called the Red Egg. So why do they call it “black”? One explanation goes this way: In 1939, an aviation engineer named François Hussenot devised a means of capturing an aircraft’s history to a box of photographic film. Onboard sensors flashed into the box through calibrated mirrors and traced a running tab of flight parameters, including altitude, air speed and the position of the cockpit controls. Because the device worked like a camera, its insides had to be in total darkness; thus, perhaps, the “black""-ness of the box.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/who-made-that-black-box.html

I can’t vouch for the latter claim, but asparagus is intensely delicious when you roast it And it’s a beautiful addition to this lemony mix of barley and herbs.

The captors claimed to have executed one of the border guards. Iran’s government-run Press TV website quoted Esmail Kosari, deputy chairman of a parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, as saying that the other four had been handed over to Iranian officials in Pakistan. It was not immediately clear why they had been released, and there was no confirmation from Pakistan’s government. The abductions on Feb. 6 caused deep strains in relations between Iran and Pakistan, and the Iranians had threatened to send troops into Pakistani territory to rescue the captives. The border area, in Sistan-Baluchistan Province in southeastern Iran, is a hotbed of Sunni militant resistance to Iran’s Shiite authorities. In October, Iran executed 16 Sunni insurgents in retaliation for an attack by armed men who crossed the border from Pakistan and killed 14 Iranian border guards near the city of Saravan.

Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer play Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van, the birth parents of Clark, who was born Kal-El on the doomed planet Krypton; Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are Martha and Jonathan Kent, the Kansas couple who adopt him after he’s rocketed to Earth; Amy Adams is his romantic interest, Lois Lane; and Michael Shannon is General Zod, his alien foe. “At once frantically overblown and beautifully filigreed, ‘Man of Steel’ will turn on everyone it doesn’t turn off,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “If you wave away all the computer-generated smoke and see past the pulverized buildings, it’s possible to remain hooked on the resonant origin story that wends through ‘Man of Steel’ — that of the immigrant.” And while Mr. Snyder isn’t capable of mythmaking, she added, “in his sometimes poetic, sometimes crude way, he has given Superman a new lease on franchise life by affirming that this most American hero is also an alien yearning to breathe free.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/05/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

(HBO) SILICON VALLEY In this new comedy created by Mike Judge, a group of socially stunted programmers shares the home — or, as they call it, the incubator — of a dot-com billionaire who lets them live rent-free in exchange for a 10 percent stake in their ventures. The show’s mockery of “obscene wealth and the grandiosity that comes with giving back” is badly needed, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “A new cultural revolution is at hand, and many of its leaders are even more smug and self-righteous than the counterculture activists who, back in the 1960s, also thought they could change the world.” She added, “ ‘Silicon Valley’ isn’t making the world a better place, it is putting the real Silicon Valley in its place, one Tesla at a time.” Above, from left, Kumail Nanjiani, Martin Starr, Thomas Middleditch, Zach Woods and T. J. Miller star in the show. The season opener of “Game of Thrones” leads in at 9; “Veep” follows at 10:30.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

2014-04-07,Document | On a Lark,"What began as a simple idea — taking portraits of caged birds against blank, colored backdrops — has turned into something of an obsession for the British photographer Luke Stephenson, whose images are compiled in a new self-published book. To access his feathered finds, he tapped into a network of quirky avian fanciers — from a vicar with an affinity for lovebirds to a hipster with an unironic collection of rare breeds — venturing into their homes with his miniature, portable studio. Save for a few dust specks, his images of budgerigars, conures, siskins and, yes, canaries aren’t retouched. He simply chooses complementary backgrounds, letting each subject get comfortable before taking its picture. Stephenson discovered that birds are generally well-behaved subjects. “Humans, on the other hand,” he says, “are a lot less predictable.” “An Incomplete Dictionary of Show Birds”; incompletedictionary.com.

The gallerist Adam Lindemann has painstakingly amassed more than 40 greatest hits — from small works embellished with the artist’s usual comic-book-style riffs to bold, monumental paintings — from a rarefied group of collectors all over the world. “Having a Pettibon surfing painting is like having a Richard Prince car hood,” Lindemann says. They’re a slick and sunny slice of American pop culture. But while Pettibon examines the trappings of surf culture in the paintings, the artist — who despite living in Venice Beach, Calif., has never ridden the waves himself — is also dealing with universal truths. These works are about the solitary surfer against the vast ocean, man against nature. “You get a sense that nature is going to swallow him up,” Lindemann notes. “You could see them as disaster paintings.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/on-view-raymond-pettibons-surf-paintings-ride-into-manhattan/

A rigorous thought process — Chu is a Harvard-trained architect and approaches designing bags as he does buildings — results in shapes that are easy, elegant problem-solvers. A sac called the “Ninja Pouch” flips and flops into multiple configurations; rectangular bags have dual handles that allow for horizontal or vertical orientation; softly structured “box” bags function as either. There’s a whiff of playful humor to the designs, underscored by the fact that Chu also sells conical party hats, made with the same premium leather and high-end stitching as the bags. As for the line’s name? It’s an acronym for One Thing at a Time, but it’s hard not to want all of it at once.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/a-new-line-minimalist-leather-goods-from-a-harvard-trained-architect/

Before the election, the Parti Québécois played down the likelihood that it would seek a third referendum on separation if re-elected. For years, polls have shown that a firm majority of Quebeckers oppose leaving Canada. Yet the party’s attempt to avoid the issue, which was the basis of its founding, fell apart last month when its star candidate, Pierre Karl Péladeau, a media magnate, immediately vowed to make Quebec a nation in a rousing speech that concluded with a raised fist.

2014-04-08,A New Twist on the Iconic Maralunga Sofa,"Cassina’s founder Cesare Cassina and the visionary furniture designer and architect Vico Magistretti crafted an enduring design legacy together, one to which even the most dedicated of couch potatoes are forever indebted. Legend has it that when Cassina first saw Magistretti’s prototype for the now-iconic 1974 Maralunga sofa, he disliked it so much that he punched it — hard. His frustration split the back of the model, which fell back over itself so that it resembled a headrest. This serendipitous series of events eventually resulted in the design for the Maralunga, the first upholstered sofa to incorporate movement — the back transforms into an actual headrest — for ultimate comfort. To mark the 40th anniversary of its bestseller, the company collaborated again with design visionaries to develop a new version of the sofa, this time tapping 20 students from the Swiss art and design school ECAL for the task. Just in time for Milan’s annual design week, Salone Internazionale del Mobile, the results are on view at the Cassina showroom in the city beginning tomorrow.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/t-magazine/a-new-twist-on-the-iconic-maralunga-sofa.html

Perhaps the setting explains the preponderance of minimalist concrete sculpture trotted out by several hometown galleries at this year’s event, which closed on Sunday. At Galeria Jaqueline Martins, São Paulo-based Ana Mazzei’s “Et Nous, Nous Marchons Inconnus” (which translates to “And We, We Walk Unknown”) was a procession of gray geometric forms marching from wall to floor. David Batchelor, a Scotsman, placed a number of cement bricks on plinths at the booth of Galeria Leme, adorning them with shards of broken, colored glass. Meanwhile, at the upstart gallery Emma Thomas, a buffet of drinking glasses (water, Margarita, shot, Champagne) were spread across a table and filled to the brim with cement by the local artist Lucas Simões. Called “Bebado Samba” (or “Drunken Samba”), it’s a punning rejoinder to Brazil’s midcentury “Concrete” and “Neo-Concrete” art movements, which spiraled off into a plurality of aesthetics and “a scene impossible to read as a single movement,” according to the artist. “ The final view can be seen as a party where the drunken conversations happen.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/threes-a-trend-concrete-sculpture-at-the-sp-arte-fair-in-sao-paulo/

2014-04-09,China: Suicide Victim Linked to Official," A senior police official linked to the disgraced Communist Party official Bo Xilai hanged himself in a hotel room last week, the state news media reported Monday. The police official, Zhou Yu, whose body was discovered Friday, played a prominent role in the “strike black” campaign under Mr. Bo, the former Chongqing party chief. The campaign was portrayed as a crackdown on organized crime but also targeted lawyers and businesspeople considered to be enemies of Mr. Bo or his allies. Mr. Bo was removed from his post in 2012, convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to life in prison. It is unclear if Mr. Zhou’s suicide was related. The microblog of a district department in the Chongqing police force said Mr. Zhou had diabetes and had recently received a diagnosis of severe liver disease that led to depression.

2014-04-09,"At the Milan Furniture Fair, Two British Designers Reinvent Passé Materials","At the Salone del Mobile in Milan this week, two of London’s biggest design talents have shacked up with each other to offer side-by-side takes on semi-outdated materials. Occupying one half of the gallery Project B, the furniture designer Max Lamb has lined an entire room — furniture included — in his new twist on terrazzo, the speckled composite material which will remind many Americans of airport flooring, but which for Lamb served as a reference to classic Italian vestibules. While the pattern is currently trending in design and fashion (see Carven’s recent terrazzo-print sweatshirts), Lamb says he’s been experimenting with it since 2011, after his frequent work with stone led him to visit an old-school terrazzo maker in Yorkshire, near where he grew up. He then “went a completely different route,” he says. His version — the first product in a new line of designer architectural surfaces called Dzek, launched by the former Phillips de Pury retail director Brent Dzekciorius — embeds chunks of marble in resin instead of cement, making the material much more durable. And unlike the terrazzo of yore, which was usually poured on-site, it’s pre-cast and sold by the square foot. “It has endless applications,” he says. “It can be used on walls, floors, ceilings. You can even C.N.C.-mill a bathtub out of it.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/t-magazine/milan-furniture-fair-two-british-designers-reinvent-passe-materials.html

(Starz) AMOUR (2012) An elderly French couple, portrayed by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, above, find their love tested when she has a stroke and he becomes her caretaker in this Oscar winner for best foreign-language film, directed by Michael Haneke. Isabelle Huppert plays their self-centered daughter — like her parents, a musician — whose questions about what she can do to help as her mother becomes increasingly incapacitated ring hollow. Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called this film “a masterpiece about life, death and everything in between.” And while some viewers may find the movie cold and even cruel, she added, “there’s another point to be made here, namely that all the violence in ‘Amour’ is crucial to Mr. Haneke’s rigorous, liberatingly unsentimental worldview, one that gazes on death with the same benevolent equanimity as life. All of which is to say: Bring hankies.

These projects bring the quality of home gardening to public spaces, creating organic environments that feel as though they’ve been growing there, on their own, for years. For his latest undertaking, Oudolf is designing the grounds of the new outpost of Hauser & Wirth gallery, a remodeled 18th-century farmhouse in the rolling hills of the English county of Somerset that is set to open in July. This film, produced by the filmmaker Thomas Piper and Checkerboard Film Foundation, will offer an intimate view of Oudolf’s process, from landscape blueprints to theories on beauty, when it hits the big screen toward the middle of next year.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/on-view-a-first-look-at-a-new-documentary-about-the-master-gardener-piet-oudolf/

2014-04-11,Russia: Lawmakers Want to Investigate Gorbachev," Five members of the Russian Parliament have asked the prosecutor general to open a criminal case to investigate the breakup of the Soviet Union and the role played by the former leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They contend that he failed to heed a referendum in 1991 that showed that a majority of Soviet citizens wanted to retain the union, and that he illegally formed a committee to study granting sovereignty to the Baltic countries. Mr. Gorbachev, 83, responded that he would cooperate but blamed the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus for the breakup. This stirring up of history captures an official mood today in Moscow, where many are questioning the legitimacy of former Soviet borders, and President Vladimir V. Putin’s government has twice in five years crossed them with the Russian Army, in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine this year.

(Ms. Steinem, above in 1969, kept secret the abortion she’d had at 22.) On Aug. 26, 1970, she helped lead the Women’s Strike for Equality on the 50th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. In 1972 she helped found Ms. Magazine, beginning her ascent as a public face of feminism. This documentary from Peter W. Kunhardt chronicles the life of Ms. Steinem, who turned 80 last month, from her childhood in Toledo, Ohio, and the inspiration for her work, to her battle with breast cancer, her late-in-life marriage and subsequent widowhood.

2014-04-11,Analyze That,"The first half of Jean Hanff Korelitz’s novel about a New York therapist is less than revelatory, although that turns out to be for excellent reason. Grace Reinhart Sachs, an affluent Upper East Side mother with a thriving couples practice, frets almost generically about such privileged concerns as how much to push her son to continue with his violin lessons. She offers loving descriptions of an ideal husband — a pediatric oncologist — who somehow never gels into either a recognizable type or an intriguingly unique character. The absence of key friends and family members feels underexplained.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/books/review/you-should-have-known-by-jean-hanff-korelitz.html

A military dictator had ruled it for almost a dozen years. Poverty, hunger and disease stalked the countryside. It felt like a place cut off from the rest of the world.

There are some who like to pin all the blame on the corrupt business practices of Wall Street and the greed of bankers. Then there are those who think it was just one more example of the sort of irrational mass hysteria that gives rise to boom-and-bust cycles in financial markets. Still others focus on the inherent characteristics of banks that seem to make them especially vulnerable to investor panics — the fact, for example, that their loans and investments cannot be liquidated in a hurry, while depositors can withdraw their cash with the click of a mouse.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/books/review/fragile-by-design-by-charles-w-calomiris-and-stephen-h-haber.html

It was a case of a demand creating its supply, the demand by Congress and citizens to understand the scale of the economic calamity the nation was then experiencing. The same demand for understanding helps explain the public’s interest these days in what might otherwise seem to be dry, uninviting economic statistics. How secure is the recovery from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis? What good is a recovery that benefits only the wealthy minority? Do our children have any hope of seeing their living standards rise as ours did over the late 20th century — or is that dream of progress over?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/books/review/zachary-karabells-leading-indicators.html
2014-04-11,Inside the List,"Wilderness Adventure: The crime novelist Nevada Barr is a write-what-you-know success story — when she began her Anna Pigeon series, about a National Park Service ranger who frequently stumbles across dead bodies, Barr was herself working as a law enforcement ranger in the park system. “I had a lot of time in the backcountry to think,” she told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans in 2008. “There were a couple of people in the park that needed killing, and I thought about how to get away with it.” (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Barr quit that job once her books started to catch on.) How did Park Service employees respond to the series? Guardedly at first, to judge from a 1995 profile in National Parks magazine that cited Barr’s perceived “disregard for both the agency and the people” who worked in the parks. “I enjoy the stories,” one employee acknowledged, “but some of the cynicism about the Park Service makes me feel like I’m at work.” Things have gotten better since then: In 2011, the National Parks Conservation Association presented Barr with an award for “enhancing public understanding of national parks” and drawing “attention to the invaluable work of National Park Service staff.” The 18th Anna Pigeon mystery, “Destroyer Angel,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Some players, who tend to be skittish and superstitious even by the standards of professional athletes, were reluctant to take part. “Getting close to the players on the field was clearly not something photographers did, but after some slow introductions, a few players agreed to help us out,” Escamilla says. “Once we showed them the photos, they were like, ‘Wow, this is rad.’ ” Julie Bosman",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/magazine/inside-baseball.html

Takacs describe the findings from an ambitious study of Hamilton students and alumni, using interviews, surveys and even an analysis of academic writing samples to tease out how college has affected them. Although Hamilton, a small, selective, expensive liberal arts college in upstate New York, has little in common with the large state universities and community colleges that most students attend, Dr. Chambliss said the lessons learned could apply everywhere.",Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/education/edlife/what-makes-a-positive-college-experience.html

These stars made it look easy, but it’s a challenge. “The difference between the stand-up and the sitcom is you’re going from the least collaborative medium there is to the most collaborative,” Mr. Seinfeld says. “The reason you become a comedian is you’re not a good collaborator, you’re not good with people, you’re not good in social situations or professional situations.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/arts/television/comedians-in-two-realms.html

Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave who assists his master. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film, which also earned Mr. Tarantino an Oscar for best original screenplay, “crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness.” He added: “Mr. Tarantino is a virtuoso of bloodshed, that is for sure, and also more enamored of a particularly toxic racial slur than any decent white man should be. But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern, though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor, what you see in ‘Django Unchained’ is moral disgust with slavery, instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2014-04-14,What’s on Monday,"10 P.M. (13) THE TRIALS OF MUHAMMAD ALI (2013) In 1967 — after changing his name from Cassius Clay, joining the Nation of Islam and refusing to be inducted into the United States military because of his religious opposition to the Vietnam War — Muhammad Ali, above, was convicted of draft evasion. Stripped of his world heavyweight championship and banned from boxing, he spent the next four years fighting legal battles. In 1971, his case for being a conscientious objector reached the United States Supreme Court. In this “Independent Lens” presentation, the director Bill Siegel combines interviews with Louis Farrakhan; Mr. Ali’s second wife, Khalilah Camacho-Ali; the journalist Robert Lipsyte; Mr. Ali’s loyal brother, Rahman; and a clerk from the Supreme Court proceedings to address Mr. Ali’s challenges then and now, including his battle with Parkinson’s. “The film falls short of explaining Mr. Ali, who, like many outspoken individuals, can stubbornly repel scrutiny, nor will it pacify the many who opposed his conscientious objections,” Nicolas Rapold wrote in The New York Times. “But it also underlines one enduring quality: namely, that he probably couldn’t care less what people think.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

The first time I saw the recipe I wanted to test it right away, but I didn’t have Asian pears. So I used an apple, and loved it. It’s the sweet, crunchy fruit that does the trick, and apples and Asian pears both work.

I learned something recently from the chef Iliana de la Vega, who demonstrated the recipe at the “Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives” conference in Napa Valley in March: she says, in no uncertain terms, that you should not add water to tomatillo salsas. Without the water, this is a more intense salsa with pleasing density.

2014-04-14,White House Pressed to Protect Ailing Monarch Butterflies," All too often, species that humans care about only get attention when they are in crisis. Such is the case with monarch butterflies. The insect, famed for its remarkable annual migrations, faced declines in habitat on both the Mexican and American ends of its range for decades, but now is the focus of an urgent push for a rescue. The latest step is a letter sent on Monday to President Obama and relevant cabinet members by a group of scientists, educators, farmers, and other concerned citizens organized by the Xerces Society and other conservation groups focused on these butterflies. The letter (read it here) describes policies the administration could pursue on both public and private land along the butterfly’s migratory path.  In February, after about 20 naturalists, poets and other monarch defenders pressed for international action in an open letter, the plight of the butterfly was addressed by President Obama and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts at a summit. The leaders agreed to create a working group to study ways to protect the butterfly at both ends of its range. A recent article by Richard Conniff in Yale Environment 360 describes what farmers can do to help monarchs. I also recommend a recent feature in The Times by Michael Wines describing efforts by various groups to restore habitat:",Opinion,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/white-house-pressed-to-protect-ailing-monarch-butterflies/

Champagne flowed as the see-and-be-seen crowd piled in to admire the “Untold” exhibition she curated there, which she explains in the above video interview with our design editor, Tom Delavan. Displaying contemporary pieces in the historic 19th-century house allowed Orlandi to “show how modern pieces are perfect and can have a fabulous dialogue with an old palace,” she says. The video opens with the light installation that she and Vionnet’s creative director, Goga Ashkenazi, commissioned from the artist Jacopo Foggini for the show. Orlandi, who was once a fashion designer and loathes the “trendsetter” label often tacked onto her globally-recognized name, is now famous for championing the careers of designers on the rise, a category Foggini fell into not long ago. “When I find a designer, first of all I want to be sure that this designer — he will grow up,” she explains. Cast in the fashion house’s signature shade of blue, Foggini’s installation set the tone for the queen of design’s fête — a high point during an action-packed week.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/on-view-rossanna-orlandi-the-queen-of-design-on-her-salone-exhibition/

Using preliminary police data, researchers identified a homicide decrease of about 16 percent, with some of the biggest drops in murders in Ciudad Juárez and Monterrey, notoriously dangerous cities that have recently calmed down as the war between criminal gangs and the government has declined in intensity. Still, experts warn, it is not clear whether the decline is attributable to an overall weakening of organized crime: The number of gun-related murders has held steady as other kinds of killing have declined, and homicides have sharply risen in states farther south. Extortion and kidnapping have also increased nationwide. But with overall murder rates down for the second year in a row from their 2011 peak, some parts of Mexico appear to be on the mend, said David A. Shirk, an author of the report. “The decrease in violence that the government in Mexico is trying to convince people of is in fact real,” he said.

Reading them, it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future, because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success. At times, as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law, he seems to be using a narrow definition, with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight, the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely, etc. But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track,” and concludes that “[Kathleen Sebelius] can leave with the law she helped build looking, shockingly, like a success,” it implies a stronger definition of victory, in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing, isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed, but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/for-obamacare-what-counts-as-success/

And they should know: Ficaro has styled props and interiors for Bon Appétit, Town & Country, Elle, Harper’s Bazaar and Domino, while Nickey co-owns a successful design company in L.A. Rather than choosing homes simply because they struck their fancy, the co-authors first rounded up a trove of creative types — artists, writers, musicians, stylists, art directors — who had interesting personal style, and then hoped their homes would follow suit. Their instincts proved correct, and the 17 nests featured in this beautiful coffee-table book, shot by the Danish photographer Ditte Isager, reveal the inspiring combination of natural light and accidental, lived-in beauty. And despite the authors’ professions, Ficaro and Nickey opted not to style or decorate any of the interiors before they were photographed. “We wanted to let the places breathe on their own,” explains Ficaro.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/book-of-creative-homes-nickey-ficaro/

2014-04-17,What’s On Thursday,"8 P.M. (Fuse) PIRATE RADIO (2009) The time: Britain in the mid-1960s, when the BBC, aided by the government, kept official radio channels mostly free of rock ’n’ roll. The place: a tanker off the British coast, where rebel broadcasters (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans, above at microphone) blasted the Stones, the Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and the Who over the airwaves. This angers a government minister (Kenneth Branagh) who wants to keep listeners safe with high culture and educational programming. The director of this movie, Richard Curtis, “isn’t concerned with exploring why gatekeepers might want to maintain the divide between high and popular culture,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “He wants to party. So he piles on the comic high jinks, lobs the jokes and cranks the splendid tunes.” Mr. Nighy can also be seen as a financially distressed British retiree lured to Jaipur, India, in John Madden’s “Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” (2012), at 4:45 on MoreMax, and as the washed-up rock star Billy Mack, angling for a comeback, in Mr. Curtis’s “Love Actually” (2003), at 8 on Showtime.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

Though she started her line in 2006, her work is gaining new attention this season; it recently debuted at Bergdorf Goodman and Dover Street Market in New York and will launch on Net-a-Porter on June 9th. Her spring collection, carved from 40,000-year-old mammoth tusks that emerged from the Russian tundra thanks to global warming, includes such designs as a pendant depicting a cloud raining thunderbolts, a necklace strung with dodo egg-shaped “pearls” and a wraparound dragon ring that features a tiny man clutching a diamond emerging from the jaws of the beast. The natural world is a leitmotif for van der Velden, who likes to tell the story of how an owl once soared through the room at one of her runway shows. For fall, her pieces will incorporate actual scarab wings. “I am fascinated by nature and its beauty,” she says. “I hate to see such beauty go to waste.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/bibi-van-der-velden-jewelry/

Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the law’s promise of deficit reduction was based (in Paul Ryan’s words) on “gimmicks and smoke and mirrors,” Chait cites a new C.B.O. estimate on the cost of the law’s coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken, and the case is closed:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/obamacare-deficits-and-empirics/

Think of Milton’s blazing, sexy Satan; Balzac’s scheming, driven master criminal, Vautrin; or Shakespeare’s Iago. Despite the allure of such characters, writers today usually avoid them, maybe because the whole category of Evil seems too theological or because modern psychology assumes that every bad act can be traced to childhood neglect or abuse and thus be explained away.

In 1954, John Updike — age 22, newly married and fresh out of Harvard, where he’d studied English literature and taken art courses — was awarded a fellowship to study abroad, and decided to apply to the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Arts in Oxford, England. Asked to explain this decision, Updike replied, “It’s always been my ambition to be the next Walt Disney.” During his childhood in Shillington, Pa., where he lived until the age of 13 and which his readers know through his Olinger stories, his mother, Linda, arranged for her prodigiously talented son to take lessons from a local artist. Later, when they moved to Plowville, 11 miles from Shillington, to a farmhouse he would describe in his novel “Of the Farm,” Updike — now 14 or 15 — began sending his drawings and cartoons to The New Yorker and other publications. For Updike, who was interested in drawing but also, like his mother, in writing, to be published in The New Yorker had been an ambition, if not an obsession, from the moment the magazine first entered the household when he was 12.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/adam-begleys-updike.html

2014-04-18,What’s On Friday,"9 P.M. (Nat Geo Wild) CESAR MILLAN: LOVE MY PIT BULL Once upon a time, the pit bull was a popular family pet beloved by President Theodore Roosevelt, Gen. George S. Patton and Helen Keller. Today, these dogs are more closely associated with gangs and dogfighting, and have been responsible for a large percentage of fatal dog attacks on humans. Pit bulls are often abused or abandoned, and are euthanized at a higher rate than other dogs, with an estimated one million put down each year in the United States. In this special, Mr. Millan chronicles the history of the pit bull as a herder and companion — in Britain, the Staffordshire bull terrier was nicknamed “the nanny dog” for its sweet disposition with children — and with his own pit bull, Junior (above, with Mr. Millan), makes the case for the dogs as loyal and loving, given the right training for both animals and humans. “All dogs are great companions,” he says. “Communication creates a partnership, and dogs have the simplest communication on the planet. For them, everything is about trust, respect and love.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

She left home for Stockholm at age 15 to pursue those ambitions until a back injury ended her career. Still, she often dreams about her first creative pursuit.

While this can lead to pungent and suspenseful storytelling, it requires a delicate balance, keeping the reader engaged in the narrative momentum of an unknown future that’s already in the past.

This coincidence — only the first of many in Ackroyd’s breezy contrivance of a novel — signals an “invisible communion” among the brothers that will link their fates even as they set out on radically different paths through life. In the end, true to the Grimm Brothers template, only one will endure his personal ordeal and emerge relatively unscathed; the other two wind up succumbing to the wiles of the true hero of the piece — the city of London itself, the only character in the book the author actually seems to care about.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/three-brothers-by-peter-ackroyd.html

While respectfully acknowledging the forces of nature (the rampaging forest fire in “Firestorm” comes to mind, as does the harsh terrain of “Winter Study”), she has always found humans to be the more savage. In DESTROYER ANGEL (Minotaur, $26.99), Barr takes this insight to a disturbing new level by allowing her series detective, the National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon, to test her belief that “animals were better people than people.” In order to survive, can she revert to her own animal nature, hunting and killing other human beings?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/nevada-barrs-destroyer-angel-and-more.html

In Goldstein’s neat finale, the pupil of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle eagerly disappears into the magnetic bowels of an fM.R.I. scanner to have his brain probed.

No one at the time had any idea if the desiccated flesh of pharaohs still contained any genetic material, so Paabo decided to run an experiment.

Robert Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr. Maybe, turning to Jennet Conant’s “109 East Palace,” we relived the Los Alamos story through the eyes of Dorothy McKibben, the widow who met the arriving scientists at a storefront one block from the Santa Fe Plaza, the first stop on what would be a long, strange ride.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/the-wives-of-los-alamos-by-tarashea-nesbit.html

But my mother, who considered the viscous vermilion swill a tonic for nearly any affliction, loved them. So I was more than happy to make them for her now and then: All it took was a good slug of Smirnoff (the only vodka we had in the house, and one I still like), a can of tomato juice (or, as my mother sometimes preferred, Clamato), a shake of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, a heaping teaspoon of grated horseradish, a few shakes of black pepper, a good stir with ice, a lemon wedge for garnish, and that was that.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/magazine/dont-get-too-cute-with-your-bloody-mary.html

Relatedly, is it ethical for taxpayers to carry the costs associated with the incarcerated mother’s pregnancy and delivery?

It excludes the period shortly afterward when Russia annexed Crimea. It was not immediately clear whom Ukraine was accusing of the deaths. Initially, Parliament sought to single out the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, but other groups may also be included. Because Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has formally given it jurisdiction with respect to the period in question. That step, which was apparently taken in early April, was announced in a court statement issued late Thursday. Ukraine’s application said it expected “that the court shall duly study the case.” But a court spokesman emphasized that it would be up to a prosecutor to decide whether to proceed, and then the court’s judges would be asked to approve the decision. An investigation is not expected any time soon. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/europe/ukraine-seeks-inquiry-into-killings.html

Although, as the author points out, many of those pilots did not, in the end, defy death.

2014-04-21,1914: Easter Scenes In Paris,"Two distinct streams of people could have been noticed outside the various Paris railway termini yesterday, the first consisting of Parisians about to quit the city for the Easter vacation, and the second, composed of English, German and other tourists, who had just arrived bent upon passing the same gay period in exploring the French capital. The result of the ingress of tourists was that the boulevards and main streets of Paris presented an even more cosmopolitan appearance than usual. Fortunately fine weather favored the sightseers and the guides reaped a rich silver harvest. Groups of energetic Teutons made an almost military inspection of the Louvre and decided with unanimity that the Mona Lisa’s smile is as over-rated as it is ambiguous.The char-à-bancs were all crowded, the majority of the passengers wearing caps. At dusk a group of English tourists, who had probably crossed the Channel for the sake of higher mental culture, marched contentedly up the avenue de l’Opéra to the immortal strains of “You made me love you,” supplied by the youngest visitor’s richly toned mouth-organ. The Frenchmen who had remained in Paris gazed upon their progress with unspeakable admiration and drank a thoughtful aperitif to the eternal durability of the “Entente Cordiale.” — The New York Herald, European edition, April 12, 1914.",Blogs,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/1914-easter-scenes-in-paris/

You can tell that from the sex and nudity (the somewhat demure basic-cable variety, but still, there’s a lot of flesh here). More important, you can tell it from the writing.

2014-04-21,What’s on Monday,"3 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, a solemn boy named Marcus feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left him adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. “Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. He added: “What does seem new — newly strange, newly beautiful — is what ‘Hereafter’ makes of the here and now. It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it’s wonderful.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

For this one, I cooked the onions with cabbage – even a half a head of cabbage that has been lingering in your refrigerator will work here – until both vegetables were soft, lightly colored and sweet. I added caraway seeds to the mix because I love the flavor of caraway with cabbage. I used 1/2 teaspoon, just enough so that people noticed; they couldn’t recognize what it was (“Cumin?” they asked) right away, but they liked it.

2014-04-21,Whole-Wheat Pie Dough,"Most of the vegetable tarts that I post on Recipes for Health call for a yeasted olive oil crust that I love to work with. With French quiches, however, I prefer a crust that resembles classic French pastry. However, I always use at least half whole-wheat flour – which is not so French – not only for its nutritional superiority, but also because it gives the resulting shell a nuttier, richer flavor that is particularly welcome in a savory tart. This dough, adapted from Jacquy Pfeiffer’s recipe for pâte brisée in “The Art of French Pastry,” involves more butter than you’re used to seeing in my recipes, but an occasional butter-based crust, especially when it’s made with whole-wheat flour and contains a filling that is all about vegetables, is not going to kill us. Instead, it’s a vehicle for the foods that we want to move toward the center of our plates.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/health/whole-wheat-pie-dough.html

For the most part the speech is getting favorable attention. So let me be a spoilsport. It’s not so much that what Sargent said is wrong, although some of his principles are by no means universally agreed upon, even in normal times.

It came to light last week that agents had approached a member of the defense team for a detainee facing trial before a military commission over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, something the defense lawyers said improperly made him an informant. The disclosure derailed a week of pretrial hearings, and the special trial counsel, Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, an assistant United States attorney, is leading an investigation into the matter. It was widely speculated that the subject of the F.B.I. inquiry was how the 36-page manuscript by Mr. Mohammed — the self-described architect of the attacks — had been leaked. But in a public court filing on Monday, Mr. Campoamor-Sanchez said that was not true. He did not identify the investigation’s actual subject, although he apparently offered greater details to the judge in an accompanying classified filing.

2014-04-22,What’s On Tuesday,"9 P.M. (13, 49) A FIERCE GREEN FIRE (2013) At one time, it was about the dams. The naturalist John Muir and the forester Gifford Pinchot waged war in the early 1900s over the flooding of the magnificent Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Decades later, the proposed damming of the Colorado River prompted public outrage, and the environmental movement was born. Today some two million organizations worldwide work on behalf of social justice and the environment. In this Earth Day tribute, “American Masters” chronicles issues (pollution, whaling, conservation of the Amazon rain forest, climate change) within the fight and the players who made a difference (Lois Gibbs, who rallied on behalf of Love Canal; David Brower, above, the first executive director of the Sierra Club; and Paul Watson and Rex Weyler, the founders of Greenpeace). “The environmental movement is about nature versus humanity,” says Robert Redford, who with Meryl Streep, Ashley Judd, Van Jones and Isabel Allende narrates this documentary, directed by Mark Kitchell. “It arose at a time when our industrial civilization has grown so powerful it threatens the natural world on which we depend for survival. It has become the battle for a living planet.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

But incomes for the middle class and poor in the United States have since been growing more slowly than elsewhere. Why? Among the reasons: This country has lost its once-wide lead in educational attainment. Other countries have increased their workers’ skill levels more quickly, helping create well-paying jobs. The United States also tolerates more inequality: The minimum wage is lower here. Executives make more money. The government redistributes less of it. By 2010, the poor in several other countries had pulled ahead. And Canada’s median income had reached a virtual tie with that of the United States. Since 2010, other data suggest Canada has moved ahead.",The Upshot,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/this-simple-table-summarizes-our-story-on-american-living-standards.html

This year’s show also drew 45.4 million viewers, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the most in 10 years. Dawn Hudson, the Academy’s chief executive, said in a statement that Mr. Zadan and Mr. Meron were “masters at tapping into the zeitgeist and capturing the hearts of movie fans around the world.” Mr. Zadan and Mr. Meron have a long history of bringing Broadway musicals to the big and little screens: They produced the film versions of “Chicago” and “Hairspray,” are in the process of producing “Pippin,” and for television have made “Annie,” “Rogers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella” and “Gypsy.” The 87th Academy Awards will be next Feb. 22, at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.

Prosecutors had accused the Huangs of starving their daughter, Gloria, 8, and originally suspected them of being child traffickers because the defendants are of Asian heritage and the child was African. The Huangs, who attributed the child’s death to an eating disorder, said the prosecution was based on flawed evidence, racial prejudices and misunderstandings about Western adoption.

(Starz Cinema) CHICKEN WITH PLUMS (2012) A celebrated but tormented violinist, Nasser-Ali (Mathieu Amalric, above), in 1958 Tehran retreats to his bed to end his life after his prized instrument is broken, in this drama from Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, based on Ms. Satrapi’s graphic novel of the same title. But in flashbacks — and flash-forwards — starring Nasser-Ali’s wife (Maria de Medeiros) and children (Mathis Bour and Enna Balland; Chiara Mastroianni and Christian Friedel portray them as adults), it soon becomes clear that his melancholy is rooted in a deeper heartache: his long-ago love, Irane (Golshifteh Farahani). “Not that ‘Chicken With Plums’ is gloomy,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Like its swooning, madly melodramatic musical score (by Olivier Bernet), the film takes an almost giddy pleasure in unhappiness, turning even pedestrian moments of boredom or discomfort into occasions for wild invention.” The result, which features a naked Sophia Loren and Edouard Baer as the Angel of Death, “is captivating, but not exactly moving.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony at different times in her life. “The main casualty of the film’s long, murky middle and end sections is the big moral theme — and also the ingenious formal gimmick — that provides the book with some of its intensity and much of its cachet,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “As the title suggests, ‘Atonement’ is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.” The film received six more Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, and won for Dario Marianelli’s score, featuring the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and a clacking typewriter.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

During a foot chase, when the pursued parties have succeeded in locking a door from the outside, one of the pursuers remarks, “They locked the door from the outside!” In the midst of a later chase (there are a lot of them), when the guys who locked that door are hiding on an abandoned school bus, someone shouts, “They’re on the bus!” And when it is revealed that one of the chief villains is in possession of a military-grade rocket, the strangeness of this fact does not go unnoticed: “Only a crazy person would have a rocket!”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/movies/paul-walker-stars-in-the-action-remake-brick-mansions.html

By then its director, John Pogue, has made a modest racket with the usual bumps in the night, some cackling and screaming, a bit of door slamming and table knocking. A fair amount of this noise seems to emanate from Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke), a hollow-eyed young patient of Professor Coupland (Jared Harris). An Oxford University lecturer, Coupland believes that the supernatural occurrences in Jane’s bleak, lonely life have been created by her mind and is using every bad idea he has — including curing her through sleep deprivation — to prove it.

He trails after her, pleasantries are exchanged, and the man, who’s moving to a nearby town, arranges to follow the family in his car. Soon after they hit the road, he is murmuring in German, and there’s no doubt that Helmut Gregor (Alex Brendemühl, suave and unnerving), as he calls himself, is no ordinary stranger.

Under the new law, expected to take effect next year, fines against companies would be increased, and company executives deemed responsible for pollution could be detained for up to 15 days. Local officials who cover up for polluting companies can be demoted or fired. Companies that have been ordered by officials to stop polluting but avoid doing so can be penalized with fines that accumulate daily. Until now, the companies had been assessed a one-time fine, Xinhua reported. The legal revisions were approved Thursday by the National People’s Congress, a legislative body that generally agrees to policies already made by Communist Party leaders.

2014-04-25,What’s on Friday,"9 P.M. (13) MATTHEW BOURNE’S SLEEPING BEAUTY In 1992, Mr. Bourne, the British choreographer, reinterpreted “The Nutcracker,” the first of three classic ballets set to scores by Tchaikovsky; in 1995, he unveiled his setting for “Swan Lake.” He completes the endeavor with this reimagining of the fairy tale about a princess who sleeps under a spell for 100 years, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1890. Mr. Bourne’s version, taped at the Bristol Hippodrome in England, begins in that year with the birth of the heroine, Aurora (danced by Hannah Vassallo, above center, with Edwin Ray, left and Danny Reubens), who falls in love not with a prince but a gardener, Leo (Dominic North), and eventually awakens in the modern day. He also provides Leo with a rival, Caradoc (Adam Maskell), the dashingly vengeful son of the evil fairy who curses Aurora to death. “The love story that Mr. Bourne substitutes isn’t any more emotionally compelling than the original,” Brian Seibert wrote in his review of the production, presented here by Great Performances, in The New York Times. “Poetically, it’s a diminishment. The battle between good and evil is reduced to a tussle between the nice guy and the bad boy.” Still, he said, “Mr. Bourne is not an ungrateful recipient of the gift of Tchaikovsky’s score. He dedicates his ‘Sleeping Beauty’ to the composer, whose work will survive this version. It’s more than 100 years old and still likely to last as long as the undead.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

While you are in heaven snorkeling through a sea of mai tais, the sinners (Hollywood stars, Harvey, this reviewer) will be stuck in a warmer place for the duration, where only the explicitly Christian films of the former “Growing Pains” heartthrob-turned-evangelist Kirk Cameron are shown, and only fake butter is available at the concession stand. (2) Skip David Grand’s “Mount Terminus,” an impressively conceived, often very entertaining novel that celebrates the oversize talents and ambitions of two cinema pioneers, the (fictional) half brothers Simon Reuben and Bloom Rosenbloom, even as it explores the destruction wrought to construct a home for their fledgling industry.

One of these urbane aspiring writers was 24-year-old Peter Matthiessen, fresh out of Yale and wrestling with his first novel, who, along with George Plimpton, William Styron, Harold Humes, Thomas Guinzburg and a few other hard-partying expats, would go on to start The Paris Review in 1953.

Enter Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and a research assistant professor at New York University. In life, Boyd retains the spirit of a youthful rebel, with her pierced tongue and name spelled in anti-Establishment lowercase.

In 1979, he described it as an attempt to “pay dues . . . to traditional fiction,” and as such, it offers a realist account of a cult that develops around Giovanni Bruno, the damaged survivor of a small-town mining disaster. Bruno’s group fixes on April 19 as the date for the Rapture, but as the title’s Darwinian allusion suggests, nothing divine will happen on their chosen mountain. Instead, the book’s climax is a primal eruption of violence, dark testimony to “another flaw in the evolution of mind.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/books/review/the-brunist-day-of-wrath-by-robert-coover.html

Certainly in this engrossing biography Miriam Pawel, a former editor and reporter with Newsday and The Los Angeles Times, is out to show both the good and bad. In the 1960s and early ’70s, Chavez did seem like a version of Gandhi. Organizing the dispossessed, our own untouchables, he fasted to the point of death, staged mass marches up and down California that resembled religious pilgrimages, and defeated growers with nationwide boycotts that even Gandhi would have found hard to duplicate. Back then, many of the best and saintliest of America’s young quit their jobs or dropped out of school to join up with Chavez and live lives of voluntary poverty.

2014-04-25,Inside the List,"Behind the Counter: The protagonist of Gabrielle Zevin’s novel “The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry” — new at No. 15 on the hardcover fiction list — is a cranky bookstore owner, depressed after the death of his wife and the theft of a prized volume, who gradually perks up while caring for a baby abandoned in his shop. Book buyers, it turns out, like to read about booksellers. In the past few years, other best-selling examples include “The Marriage Bargain,” by Jennifer Probst (a billionaire proposes to a bookstore owner), “Murder of a Bookstore Babe,” by Denise Swanson (death by shelving), and “Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore,” by Robin Sloan (a web designer finds a night job at a mysterious shop). Yet Zevin recently told readers of The National Post in Canada that as appealing as the idea of running a bookstore is in theory, in reality she’s just not interested. “I think this is the pet pipe dream of many of us who love books,” she said. “I sometimes like to imagine the kind of bookstore I would run. I have, for instance, a deeply impractical idea for a performance art space/minimalist bookstore. The bookstore would only sell one title a month, and there would be a play or art installation of some kind based around that book. However, this is all just fantasy. Running a bookstore is ridiculously difficult, and the challenges bookstores face — e-books, online competition — are enormous. I suspect the closest I’ll ever come to owning a bookstore is having written ‘The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

They will make their request at their first hearing, scheduled for Monday, the lawyers said. The couple, Matthew and Grace Huang, and their lawyers learned only this week of the legal grounds cited by the lower court for the guilty verdict. The lawyers said they were baffled by the child endangerment conviction, which carries a three-year prison term and was never part of the original case presented by prosecutors. “Everybody on our team was scratching their heads,” said Randy Papetti, one of the lawyers. “This is simply out of left field.” The Huang case has come to symbolize what critics call the arbitrary system of criminal justice in Qatar, where foreign workers constitute a majority of the population. The Huangs have said their daughter, Gloria, 8, suffered an eating disorder and was not denied food as asserted by prosecutors, who suspected the parents were child traffickers because they are of Asian heritage and Gloria was from Ghana.

The book’s frequent references to 19th century fiction notwithstanding, Piketty concedes that there are likely to be fewer extraordinarily large estates (relative to the wealth of society as a whole) in 21st century Europe and America than there were in, say, his native France two hundred years ago.

2014-04-28,What’s on Saturday,"9:40 A.M. (Starz Cinema) A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP (2010) In this faithful remake of Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Blood Simple” (1984), the director Zhang Yimou moves the action from modern-day Texas to a desolate valley in northwest China in the feudal past, above, where the wife (Yan Ni) of a rich and sexually sadistic noodle-shop owner, Wang (Ni Dahong), is carrying on with one of his employees (Xiao Shenyang). Then Zhang (Sun Honglei), a detective hired by Wang to kill the adulterous couple, arrives on the scene, and all hell breaks loose. “Though it begins with some exaggerated, almost clownish business and includes a handful of clean and mordant sight gags, ‘A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop’ has a gravity that is surprising, given that it is basically the pastiche of a pastiche,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But by working through the self-conscious genre imitation that was something of a novelty in ‘Blood Simple,’ Mr. Zhang uncovers the primal, mythic intensity of the story and also changes the tone of its essential nihilism. The Coens posit a universe without order or meaning, and while Mr. Zhang does not necessarily quarrel with this view, he treats it less as a cosmic joke than as a grim folk tale.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

(OWN) RUNNING FROM CRAZY (2013) Mariel Hemingway — in her own words: “tall blonde, no problems” — discusses the famous ancestry and mental health challenges of her family, including the suicides of her grandfather Ernest Hemingway and her sister Margaux, in this documentary directed by Barbara Kopple and commissioned by Oprah Winfrey’s OWN channel. Ms. Kopple follows Ms. Hemingway, above, while she visits her family, including her daughters, Dree and Langley, and other sister, Joan, a.k.a. Muffet; gives speeches on her wellness regime; and works out with a male companion. “ ‘Running From Crazy’ — the title is Ms. Hemingway’s phrasing — doesn’t entirely escape the dangers of the confessional profile,” Nicolas Rapold wrote in The New York Times. “But Ms. Kopple shows how people in Ms. Hemingway’s position, with a family history of mental health problems, confront a foreboding mirror, whether or not it also reflects a literary heritage and a Kennedy-grade bone structure.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

The comments of these 478 readers are posted without going through the Times’s moderators – about a dozen people who read comments and decide whether they should be posted. The idea is to expedite the process of getting at least some comments posted, which also lowers the overall number of comments that need moderation in advance.Some don’t like it. Michael Simmons, for one, calls it “unfair and wrong.” In a comment on my recent Sunday column, he wrote: “This has created a hierarchy of commenters wherein the same handful of readers have their comments posted before everyone else — sometimes many hours before everyone else can be vetted. This has led to abuse of the comments section, including verified commenters wishing readers happy holidays on occasion. I’m tired of reading the same commenters at the top of the Reader’s Picks by virtue of the fact that they were able to post before everyone else.

2014-04-28,"Pear Smoothie With Spinach, Celery and Ginger","I have to admit, this began as a “clean out the refrigerator and (aging) fruit bowl” smoothie. I salvaged some spinach that had seen better days and finally used up the last of the pears I’d bought a few weeks ago for another set of recipe tests. I went out to my garden and grabbed some bolting arugula and some mint. I’ve been drinking kefir, a fermented milk product much like yogurt but thinner and tangier, so that went in, giving the smoothie a pleasantly acidic edge. The two ingredients that the drink needs in order for it to taste like something other than a bland green drink are the half banana and the ginger. If you let your bananas ripen completely, then freeze them, they’ll contribute not only flavor, sweetness and texture but also ice to your smoothies.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/health/pear-smoothie-with-spinach-celery-and-ginger.html

I did add a piece of ginger to this smoothie and loved the way it pumped up the flavor. I didn’t use any dairy in this one, just orange juice. And I found that it required no additional sweetener, though you could add a teaspoon of agave nectar or honey if you wish. It’s best to use the pungent, feathery wild arugula for this.

I like to use kefir, but yogurt will work too.

In a statement, the organizers said a security guard received an anonymous phone call warning him to leave the boat shortly before the explosion. Palestinian fishing boats are permitted to sail up to six nautical miles from the coast under Israeli restrictions. The boat was scheduled to sail in June from Gaza to European ports carrying Palestinian goods for export. Attempts to breach the blockade have usually involved boats trying to sail to Gaza.
