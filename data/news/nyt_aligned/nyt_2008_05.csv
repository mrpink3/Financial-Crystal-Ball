2008-05-01,Germany: Catch the Next Iceberg Out of Town," Knut, the Berlin Zoo polar bear cub abandoned by his mother, was a sensation a year ago, a ball of white fluff who seduced the world. Now, as he has grown into a 350-pound adolescent, too big and strong to play with his handler, newspapers have taken issue with everything from Knut’s weight to his sexuality, with one newspaper asking if the bear is gay. But the most enduring question is the one posed from the beginning: how would being hand-raised by humans affect him? “With Knut, it’s clear that he has imprinted on humans, and when neither his keeper nor visitors are there, he cries out,” said Thomas Pietsch, a biologist. Peter H. Arras, a zoologist, put it more succinctly: “He’s a psychopath addicted to human attention.” That attention has fallen off significantly. On a recent afternoon, the fading star lay with his head on his paws, his fur stained from rolling around in sand and dirt. “Is that Knut?” a group of teenagers asked. Told that it was, they looked disappointed. “Oh,” one said, and barely a minute later, they were gone. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/world/europe/01briefs-CATCHTHENEXT_BRF.html

Weiner, Democrat of Brooklyn and Queens, drives a 2008 Chevrolet Impala, leased for $219 a month. Representative Michael R. McNulty, a Democrat from the Albany area, gets around in a 2007 Mercury Mariner hybrid, a sport -utility vehicle, for $816 a month. Jim Saxton, a Republican of New Jersey, leases a 2004 Chevy TrailBlazer at $310 a month. Gregory W. Meeks, a Queens Democrat, leases a 2007 Lexus LS 460 at $998 a month. And Charles B. Rangel, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, leases a 2004 Cadillac DeVille for $777.54 a month.

It’s like an airplane.” (See related graphic.)There are few restrictions on what kind of car the members can choose, and there is no limit on how much they can spend.

This gymnastic accident, she said, caused her to erase part of a tape famous for having an 18 ½-minute gap: a crucial conversation between her boss and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. In the June 20, 1972, conversation, the men were thought to have discussed the Watergate break-in, which occurred three days earlier, so theirs was a chat that the special counsel was eager to hear.

The photographer is in good company: the lobby features a giant color-field painting by Peter Halley, and at the bottom of the outdoor pool, Andy Warhol gazes up from a Gerard Malanga filmstrip that has been acid-etched into the tiles.

2008-05-05,Paperback Row," SUPREME DISCOMFORT: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas, by Kevin Merida and Michael A. Fletcher. (Broadway, $15.95.) Thomas, the most controversial figure on the Supreme Court, is a man of contradictions. A beneficiary of affirmative action, he opposes it; the author of sometimes unfeeling legal opinions, he is compassionate in his personal relations. Merida and Fletcher, journalists at The Washington Post, conducted hundreds of interviews with Thomas’s friends, relatives and colleagues; they focus most successfully on his upbringing and early experience. “The problem of color is a mantle” Thomas “yearns to shed, even as he clings to it,” they write.

What happens when the spouse you’ve leaned on and trusted for decades turns out to have a secret life?

2008-05-05,Entitled to What?,"Virtually unnoticed during the primary season, the baby boom generation turned 62 this year and began to draw Social Security benefits. This heralded a milestone in America’s aging, and depending on which of the candidates you ask, it spells a budgetary straitjacket or possibly a looming social crisis. Over the next generation, the population of seniors will practically double, to 72 million. With more people retiring and a smaller share of people working, the strains on Social Security and especially Medicare will become evident. Over the very long term, the two programs combined are projected to consume virtually the entire federal budget. A portion of Medicare (the part that pays hospital bills) faces insolvency much sooner than that  in 2019. “The entitlement problem is here and now,” says Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow of the Urban Institute. “It is so big and overwhelming, none of the candidates feel they can tackle it.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-lede-t.html

When it comes to his own wood-paneled, climate-controlled booze boutique (above), Le Dû doesn’t mind raising a glass to himself: “It is as close to a perfect wine shop as possible.” Or it will be when he finally hunts down a one-of-a-kind eau de vie. “I’m trying to find the absolute best bottle to import,” he says. “I’m not giving up.” We’ll drink to that.

His later work abounded in such pitiless depictions, inaugurating a modern Chinese literature marked by what the critic C. T.

In either case, he first creates what he calls “imaginary architecture,” using torches, hurricane lanterns on pillars or lights strung in trees to make guests feel safe. Next he chooses one color element. “Constancy is where we derive our power image,” he notes. Can Monn purchase power among the offerings of CB2, Crate and Barrel’s cheap-and-cheerful offshoot? No problem. He quickly struck upon his color: “Live chartreuse green”  or Olivine, in CB2-speak  which works outdoors as a “continuation of what the eyes are already seeing.” In fact, he liked the textures and ease offered by CB2 so much, guests at one of the three beach weddings he’s organizing this summer should keep a (green) eye out.

A portrait photographer, Mr. Cheng had taken Wang Qiyao’s photo in the late 1940s; the picture appeared in a magazine, and she went on to win third place in the Miss Shanghai beauty contest, the pinnacle of her career. By the time they meet again, it is 1960. Tragedy and ill-starred romance have ruined Wang Qiyao’s reputation; she is pregnant with the child of a lover whose identity she refuses to reveal. Food shortages have pushed China to the brink of famine, so Mr. Cheng, taking pity on her, invites Wang Qiyao to share his modest lunch of rice and salt pork. At his apartment, “after her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she saw that the little world inside had barely changed; it was as if the little room had been encased in a time capsule. ... Wang Qiyao failed to understand that it is precisely this myriad of unchanging little worlds that serves as a counterfoil to the tumultuous changes taking place in the outside world.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/books/review/Prose-t.html

The costumes also include large panels, called patches, made of painstaking, intricate beadwork — a confluence of African and Native American traditions. So much fine handwork wouldn’t be wasted on mere decoration; the patches often involve symbols and stories. Many show battles between cowboys and Indians, complete with dead cowboys.

Two years of DNA research has determined that none of the remains billed as those of the poet and playwright were actually his, The Associated Press reported, citing MDR television. In 1826, 21 years after Schiller died in Weimar, Germany, and was buried in a common grave in Jacobs Cemetery, it was decided that he needed a new resting place, Fürstengruft Cemetery. The mayor, Carl Leberecht Schwabe, a Schiller fan, decided that of the 23 skulls exhumed from the common grave, the biggest must have been Schiller’s. A skeleton believed to be a match was put together with the skull, and everything was buried anew in 1827, to be joined in 1832 by Schiller’s friend Goethe, who was interred alongside him, above. About 60,000 people visit the site annually. Researchers later unearthed two other skulls said to be Schiller’s. But none of them were supported by DNA from the remains of two Schiller sisters and two sons. Hellmut Seemann, president of the Foundation of Weimar Classics, which oversees the Schiller archives and exhibitions, said he believed the remains were probably still in the Jacobs Cemetery.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/arts/design/05arts-WHERESSCHILL_BRF.html

The agency maintains that “a material error in law” was made at Snoop Dogg’s hearing in January, when he was cleared to enter Britain by an immigration judge who said he found no evidence that Snoop Dogg was responsible for any public disorder. Last month the agency lost its appeal of that ruling. In announcing its decision to appeal once more, a representative said, “We will continue to oppose the entry to the U.K. of individuals where we believe there may be a risk to the public.” The case began when Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was refused a visa for a tour after he and five members of his entourage were arrested during a reported melee at Heathrow Airport in 2006.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/arts/music/05arts-NOWTHEREMATC_BRF.html

Between performances and parades, and the geography of where stages are situated, it’s virtually impossible not to run into a brass band, Mardi Gras Indians or both. I assume that’s by design; those traditions infuse all sorts of other New Orleans music and they are the main heritage in “Jazz and Heritage.” To see so many groups maintaining their street-level music after Katrina is heartening, and their tunes are incorrigibly upbeat. Yet after a few days the novelty wears off: oh, yeah, here come more Indians. And then Jazzfest is over and I’m headed back to New York, where Indian gangs don’t vow to “set your flag on fire” over a tambourine beat and there’s not a brass-band gig somewhere every night of the week. There’s not even one a month. Like other things that make New Orleans so utterly singular, what’s commonplace within that one city should never be taken for granted.

2008-05-06,This One’s on Trent Reznor,"In an unusual nod to the popularity of free music online, the rock act Nine Inch Nails is offering its new studio album, “The Slip,” through its Web site, nin.com, for nothing. In a post on the site, the band’s leader, Trent Reznor, said, “Thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years  this one’s on me.” The album, which became available for download early Monday morning, seems to be the first time a superstar act has distributed an entire album free, without an option for fans to pay. Two months ago the band issued the instrumental album “Ghosts I-IV,” allowing fans to obtain a portion of it free or the entire recording for $5. Before that the British rock act Radiohead offered its 2007 album, “In Rainbows,” online with a tip-jar-style setup in which buyers could name their price, including nothing. “The Slip” could serve as a test of how the easy availability of free music online affects later CD sales and other money-making opportunities. “The Slip” will not be sold on CD or vinyl until at least July. But the free digital version could stoke interest for Nine Inch Nails’ recently announced concert tour. Not everyone seems convinced that such giveaways will be more than a promotional gimmick. But Jim Guerinot, the talent manager who represents Nine Inch Nails  which is now without a record contract and controls its own recordings  said: “Free exists whether you want to acknowledge it or not. Let’s acknowledge that, use it and do something with it.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/arts/music/06arts-THISONESONTR_BRF.html

I finally looked this up in Harold McGee’s “On Food and Cooking” and, well, it doesn’t work: whatever is going to burn at about 250 degrees will still burn at about 250 degrees.

2008-05-07,Film Says Franco Rigged Eurovision Contest,"The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco rigged the vote in the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest, cheating the British entertainer Cliff Richard, below, of victory, according to a documentary to be televised on Thursday in Spain, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Richard’s song “Congratulations” was the favorite in the competition, held that year in London, but it was beaten by a single point by “La La La,” sung by a Spanish contestant, Massiel. The film contends that Franco (that’s his statue below, in Santander, Spain), bought votes by dispatching music and television executives to other countries in Europe to purchase the rights to series that were never broadcast and to sign obscure acts. José María Iñigo, a Spanish public television journalist, told the documentary that the Franco regime “had a great need to win recognition, even if it was only in one area.” In 1968 the winner of the Eurovision contest was determined by a jury from each participating country. The winner is now chosen by votes cast by telephone and text message from television viewers. Informed of the content of the documentary, Mr. Richard told The Guardian of London, “I’ve lived with this No. 2 thing for so many years, it would be wonderful if someone official from the contest turned around and said, ‘Cliff, you won that darn thing after all.’ ”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/arts/07arts-FILMSAYSFRAN_BRF.html

It is long  and it’s going to be cut.” Once that is accomplished, he said, the “story itself will be more highlighted.” He denied that Trevor Nunn, the director, was forced to shrink the show, and denied rumors that management had planned to post a closing notice at the New London Theater over the weekend. “We’ve never posted a closure notice, nor discussed it,” he said, adding that “Gone With the Wind,” starring Jill Paice as Scarlett O’Hara and Darius Danesh as Rhett Butler, would continue through the traditionally slack months of May and June.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/theater/07arts-FURTHERTRAVA_BRF.html

A “rice box” with roast meat will go for U.S. $3-5, or H.K. $25-40. Don’t expect much in terms of presentation or service.Poultry will usually be served with minced raw ginger and scallion. Pork will usually be drizzled with soy-infused drippings. “Siu yuk” may come with a dab of mustard.

2008-05-07,"La Vie Bohème, in East Williamsburg","In an evocative front-page article, Cara Buckley examines life at two sprawling, almost identical five-story former factories that face each other and sit at 248 and 255 McKibbin Street. Perhaps 300 people — mostly young, white, and hip — live in each building, from one to eight people to each loft. Few were born before the mid-1980s. Rents can range from $375 for one person to roughly $800 for a space. “To spend a few days at the McKibbin lofts is to experience what it is to be young, hungry for acceptance, and willing to put up with just about anything in order to gain a foothold in the city’s competitive, and thriving, underground art and music scenes,” Ms. Buckley writes. “This could have been Greenwich Village 60 years ago, or SoHo 30 years ago, or the East Village in the 1990s.”",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/la-vie-boheme-in-east-williamsburg/

(Photo: Nicole Mackinlay Hahn)Africa may be the second largest continent, but in the fashion world, it can be pretty darned difficult to find on the map. “Most American don’t know where Tunisia is,” exclaims Leslie Hoffman, the executive director of the environmental organization Earth Pledge. The could soon change. “Reap What You Sew,” a new interactive video installation at Barneys New York by the artist and filmmaker Nicole Mackinlay Hahn aims to connect items like Christian Louboutin pumps and Phillip B. beauty products (not to mention consumers) to their place in the African supply chain. No mean feat according to Julie Gilhart, Barneys Fashion Director. “We asked all of the buyers where their products were made, and a lot of them didn’t even know,” she says. Hahn spent several years traveling all over Africa, documenting people at work and at play. Some 200 clips — from the enlightening (factory workers dying fabric) to the entertaining (a group of men practicing their dance moves set to multiple versions of Toto’s “Africa”) — are on view on the ninth floor at Barneys through the end of May. Hahn predicts that the RFID technology she used to make her art piece (the same used to create E-Z Pass) will soon be the norm in the retail world, ushering in a new age of accountability for producers and consumers alike.

Murphy, takes readers inside 20 homes to show how the interiors evolved over time with the residents’ needs. A modest row house from 1827, for example, was renovated in 1893 to transform it into a space appropriate for Robert Blum, a celebrated artist interested in “Japonisme.” And in 2003, an 1801 town house was renovated by Ben Cherner and Emma O’Neill, architects who turned it into four Modernist apartments with a penthouse that blurs the boundaries between indoor and outdoor space. Don’t look for celebrity homes; Mr. Murphy omitted homeowners’ names to protect their privacy. But photographs by Paul Rocheleau provide plenty of insider access.

2008-05-08,Scent Notes | Privet Bloom by Hampton Sun,"There is a class of fragrance that lies somewhere between perfume and scent. On the one hand, there are classical perfumes — multifaceted works of olfactory art, based on ideas and built with complexes of raw materials, in styles as varied and intellectualized as pointillism and expressionism. On the other, aromatherapy — mono-themed smells, generally built in minimalist (if not inchoate) style and structure, meant simply to hypnotize like the single, pulsing tone of a Buddhist bowl, lulling into a state of non-thought. Where perfumes seek to convey ideas, aromas are designed to produce the opposite outcome, intentionally tamping down thought: the scent concept of being free of scent concepts.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/scent-notes-privet-bloom-by-hampton-sun/

2008-05-09,Dan Rather Revises Lawsuit Against CBS,"Less than a month after a New York State judge dismissed large parts of the Dan Rather lawsuit against CBS, his former employer, Mr. Rather has amended his original lawsuit and resubmitted it to the court. He continues to contend that CBS violated his contract by failing to give him sufficient work after removing him as anchor of “CBS Evening News” in March 2005. In the new filing, made in State Supreme Court on Wednesday, Mr. Rather argues that his subsequent efforts to secure a job with ABC, NBC or CNN  he says he met with executives of each in 2006  went nowhere, at least partly because of the damage done to his reputation by CBS. Mr. Rather’s career at CBS was upended after he served as the correspondent on a 2004 report for the weekday edition of “60 Minutes” that purported to raise new questions of favoritism in the Vietnam-era National Guard service of President Bush. The network later said it could not verify the documents on which the report had been based. While the judge, Ira Gammerman, said last month that Mr. Rather could continue to pursue a claim against CBS that his contract was breached, he rebuffed Mr. Rather’s efforts to collect damages from Sumner M. Redstone, the executive chairman of CBS; Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS; and Andrew Heyward, the former president of CBS News.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/arts/09arts-DANRATHERREV_BRF.html

2008-05-12,Witness to an Afghan Suicide Bombing,"(Photo: Stephen Dupont/Contact Press Images)  See a Slide Show. Warning: Some readers might find the images disturbing.  Two days after the April 27 assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, the photojournalist Stephen Dupont and the writer Paul Rafael, both Australian, were traveling with an opium eradication team in eastern Afghanistan’s Nangarhar Province when a suicide bomber attacked their convoy. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 15 and wounded 14. Both journalists were among the injured; Mr. Dupont suffered minor injuries to his head, and Mr. Rafael serious ones.  Afghanistan is again expected to have a bumper poppy crop this year, and Afghan eradication teams like the one they were traveling with have come under increasing attack from the Taliban or other armed groups, who use the profits from the opium trade to fuel the insurgency against American and NATO forces. The following is an account of the attack by Mr. Dupont, who was working for Contact Press Images and on assignment for Smithsonian magazine, at the time. You can view a slide show of images taken by Mr. Dupont before and after the attack.  That morning we set off from Jalalabad in a convoy of about eight vehicles, green Ford pickups and one small truck with 50 to 60 laborers. About 40 minutes later we came to a small town, Khogyani. The truck in front of us pulled up to the gate of a police barracks. We were at the edge of the town, the police buildings facing fields in a desert valley below.   We stopped. The driver and the commanding officer got out, and everyone started jumping off the back of the flatbed, all the police meeting each other. Paul and I waited in the truck. We had the windows down and were smoking, talking, when I heard a huge bang. Then I saw black. I still don’t know if it was smoke or if I actually blacked out.   When I could see again, I got out of the car and I ran. My instinct led me away. I heard gunfire. Some Afghans were running and I ran with them. We took cover behind a mound of dirt 30 or 40 yards away. Blood poured down my face. I didn’t know how badly I was wounded, and I started asking people could they tell me if I was O.K.  Crouched with me was an Afghan cameraman and some police officers. Then I looked toward the vehicles, 20 yards from where the bomb had gone off, and I saw six or seven bodies. That’s the first time I knew that people had been wounded or killed. I started to move toward the bodies, and then after 10 or 20 seconds, I thought, “Where’s Paul?”   I headed back to our vehicle. Paul was still in his seat, his right side completely covered in blood, but he seemed coherent. I spoke to him, saying, “You’re O.K.,” and things like that. He didn’t say anything. All around people were shredded like minced meat, mangled bodies missing heads, legs and arms. I didn’t see many wounded. I remember one guy alive sitting among all these bodies. I think it made an impression just because he was alive in this mess. I started taking pictures. I felt I was taking pictures of evidence.   Eventually, the Americans, who were from the 173rd Airborne Brigade and incredibly hospitable, gave us a medevac flight to Bagram Air Base, outside Kabul. Paul is here, too. He’s got five holes in the back of his head, two the size of golf balls. There’s a bone fragment stuck inside one. They don’t know if it’s his or somebody else’s. They think it may be pushing up against his brain, affecting his vision. I’ve talked to him and he seems O.K., except for the vision and not hearing from his right ear. They think he may have punctured his eardrum.   -- STEPHEN DUPONT ",Blogs,https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/blogs/09thelede-witness-1463.html

High school students, for example, have done great work on human trafficking, perhaps because it’s kids their age who are being locked up in brothels in India and Cambodia. Among the high school-led groups on that issue are Loosen Change to Loosen Chains and Minga. Minga’s founder was inspired by Free the Children,  a network of children helping other exploited children through education and other means. Girls Learn International is another example of high school kids fighting trafficking and helping kids abroad by keeping them in school.

But a closer look at those prosecutions, Benjamin Weiser writes, reveals something that has not been trumpeted: more than 20 cases in which judges found police officers’ testimony to be unreliable, inconsistent, twisting the truth or just plain false. The judges’ language was often withering: “patently incredible,” “riddled with exaggerations,” “unworthy of belief.”",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/in-gun-cases-police-testimony-met-with-disbelief/

The art was visible only to viewers peeping through small holes in a white wall. Ms. Stavitskaya said the case was driven by government displeasure with the museum’s involvement in controversial projects.

No painters made the shortlist of four artists. The nominees were sculptors and visual artists: Runa Islam, Goshka Macuga, Cathy Wilkes and Mark Leckey. Mr. Leckey features cartoon characters in his work, Ms. Wilkes uses shop mannequins in many of her installations, Ms. Islam recreates cult movie scenes, and Ms. Macuga draws inspiration from the German horror film “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.” Anticipating a hostile or derisive response from critics and newspapers, Stephen Deuchar, director of Tate Britain in London and chairman of this year’s Turner jury, said: “This is art made by people for people. What is vital about the Turner Prize is that it creates informed debate about art. People are not frightened to argue about its merits and demerits.” The Turner Prize, open to British artists under 50, carries a top prize of $49,000. Each runner-up receives $9,740. Work by the shortlisted artists will be exhibited at Tate Britain beginning Sept. 30.

The buildings alone were mute, and the flamboyant murals of Saddam that decked their walls were no different from a thousand others he'd seen in Iraq: a stern Saddam pointing an admonishing finger; a playboy Saddam in shades and a Panama hat; a happy soldier Saddam in epaulets, crowned by crossed swords and circled by fluttering white doves. But he had since heard the harrowing stories of the prison's past: how so many prisoners were kept in some cells that half of them had to stand while the other half slept; how they were fed one meal a day of soup, rice or lentils, and a piece of bread; how guards extorted protection money from prisoners and their families; how Saddam's son Qusay, the secret-police chief, would stop by and order a thousand executions because he felt like it; how prisoners were bolted to the floor and hung from the rafters, subjected to electric shocks, and beaten until they might feel lucky to be killed. McCotter had explored the death house — the torture chambers and cells for the condemned within earshot of the clanging iron trapdoors of the gallows. His interpreters had read to him the last words of prayer and despair scratched into those cell walls, and one day, while inspecting work at the prison, he had been summoned to the gate because an American reporter was there accompanying four Iraqis who had their own desperate plea.

The National Endowment for the Arts announced Tuesday that it was establishing yearly Opera Honors awards and named the first four recipients (right, from top): James Levine, the Metropolitan Opera’s music director; the soprano Leontyne Price; the composer Carlisle Floyd; and Richard Gaddes, general director of the Santa Fe Opera. Each receives a $25,000 prize. To put that $100,000 in context, the endowment is giving $2.5 million in direct opera grants this year and $7 million in other classical music grants, according to Dana Gioia, its chairman. Total grants to the arts are $72 million, with another $48 million sent to state arts councils to make their own allocations. Mr. Gioia said the awards have an “enormous symbolic value” and were established in part to stir awareness and appreciation of opera. While $25,000 could mean a lot more to a struggling singer, say, than to Mr. Levine, who may make more than that for a guest conducting engagement, Mr. Gioia called the prize “a lifetime achievement award.” “If the N.E.A. opera award is going to have credibility,” he added, “it has to recognize artists that work at the highest reaches of the art and to create, as it were, a hall of fame of American opera artists. It would be remiss, I think, not to start with the very best.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/arts/14arts-NATIONALENDO_BRF.html

There was no way to limit it, because there wasn't anything that wouldn't grow in Southern California. He supposed his senses were attuned to everything tonight. He had trained himself over the past twenty-five years to be intensely aware of his surroundings, particularly when he was alone at night. He knew there was a cat watching him from the safety of the porch railing to his right, and he knew there was a man walking along the sidewalk a half-block behind him. He had seen him as he had turned the corner — not quite as tall as Phil Kramer, but well-built, and wearing a jacket on a night that was too warm for one.

The Forest Service has argued that the contracts help pay for clearing underbrush and other fire-prevention programs. Environmental groups, backed by Attorney General Jerry Brown, said the approved plans failed to protect the spotted owl and other scarce species.

2008-05-15,Paris Memo | Lindsay Lohan Hangs At The Louvre,"The annual traveling fashion circus that is the Fornarina Urban Beauty Show touched down at the Carrousel du Louvre on Monday night. Imagine, if you will, the poppy Italian sportswear company setting up an enormous temporary shop, and a series of giant, fantastical installations by artists like Moebius, Glenn Barr, tattooist Angelique Houtkamp and Junko Mizuno, featuring lip-synching models dressed up in bedazzled denim mermaid bikinis, trapeze artists and a winged male dancer in tighty whities trapped in a cage. There were thousands of assembled Euros to take it all in, mostly Fornarina’s best customers and sales associates (ie, more Italians in France since the Italians ceded Sardinia in 1860). They were shopping up a storm, dancing to music by Aurore LeBlanc, and generally making way more noise than a museum-adjunct space should ever be forced to endure. Things got even louder with the appearance of Lindsay Lohan, who let slip that she’s the new face of Fornarina come Spring ’09. (The trendy, clubby label and the clubgoer who never saw a flippy party dress she didn’t like are a good match if you ask us.) For any of you looking for dirt, we hate to disappoint you: Lohan was on time, well-behaved and all in all quite professional — though she was indeed wearing leggings. In fact, she confirmed that she is going ahead with producing her own line, called 6126 after Marilyn Monroe’s birthday, and admitted it was a retort to the many Internet critics who jeer at her for her leggings habit. Intermix has picked 6126 up, and perhaps there will be more design coming from Lohan. “Maybe a handbag,” she said.

2008-05-16,Voices and Visions,"Last time I blogged, I was about to go into the studio and see what snakes came flying out of my mouth, so to speak. No snakes this time. Just one little verse of the song ""Pale Cowboy."" It's a very restrained verse, kind of formal-feeling, which fits its subject.  If your friend is an orchid then you are a rose. Upright and thorny against your horizon. Still solitary with all petals closed. In the heat when the heart's desert sun is arising.        I wrestled with myself for a while about whether the word ""heat"" should be ""cool."" After all, flowers open in the warmth and stay closed in the coolness. And if the sun is arising in this person's heart, then it is morning, and morning tends to be cool, not warm, so that's why the petals are closed. Well, it will be hotter later and that's when the petals will be open, probably. So there is an expectation set up in the song.  When I talk about ""morning,"" I am talking about this person's age and experience — if his lifetime is one day, he would be approaching the noontime of it. Well, now that I think about it he would be approaching the afternoon of it — he is a young man but still past 30. As I said, not someone I know well. So I think ""heat"" is O.K., and it sounds better next to ""heart."" Which is important.  The guitar part is tricky and I have to practice it. I had Britt, my engineer, repeat it three times so we could see how long the finished song might be. And so that I could figure out, does it need a bridge? Maybe a section that would become a real chorus? You should know that this clip is not here just for your entertainment but to illustrate the problems I am wrestling with -- that's why I left it as it is, and didn't just fade it out -- so you can hear what I am doing in real time.  (Photo: Suzanne Vega and Britt Myers in the studio recently. (Photo: Brittany Barney))   So the main image in this song is that he is a ""rose."" Most songs begin for me with an image of some kind in my mind. A man is a flower in this case. If you have an image in your mind, what is another word for that? Some people might call it a vision. It is usually some kind of metaphor, which I feel reveals a deeper truth. You can say a man is just a man, but if you say he is like a rose, that gives you an idea of what kind of man he might be. Thorny and fragile. And the other man, his friend, is an orchid -- open-petaled, exotic, more of a hothouse flower.  I had a cat whose name was Cow. And that gives you an idea of what kind of cat she was — fat with black spots. I had to defend myself once against a couple of Italian journalists who demanded to know, Why do you always lie in your songs? You are not a small blue thing. What is all of this about a queen and a soldier? Why don't you say what you mean? Well, I say what I mean, but sometimes I am attempting to write something that I see in a world beyond this one, and the metaphor is the way to get there.  Many times a song will begin with a clear image in my mind, but sometimes a song can begin with a melody popping into your head. How does it come? On an instrument? With a voice? On something unearthly that is neither, maybe. It could be a clear voice that says, for example, ""Men in a war, if they've lost a limb, still feel that limb as they did before."" I heard that line clearly in my mind and it sounded like a voice to me.   But voices and visions are scary to admit to. And also you have to make time for them, or they go on to someone else.

They were being trapped as part of a federal and state effort to protect endangered Chinook salmon.

One of the six that died was a tagged animal. Officials initially believed that the animals had been shot in the cages but later determined that they died from heat exhaustion. For reasons that remain unclear, gates on the cages, shown covered above, had closed unexpectedly, preventing the sea lions from cooling off in the water.

2008-05-19,Locomotive in Petticoats,"In 1878, Queen Victoria used a telephone for the first time, after Alexander Graham Bell arranged a demonstration. A phone was placed on a piano and a series of songs played and sung for the curious monarch, who listened intently. In retrospect, this little incident seems charged with symbolism, a marker of the old age touching the new. But who had the honor of performing for the queen, albeit telephonically? Not a famous musician, nor even a Briton, but rather an American journalist named Kate Field who’d been moonlighting for Bell as what we would now call a P.R. flack. With her knack for job-juggling, eye for the main chance and limitless energy, Field (1838-96) was herself a pure product of modernity, a self-invented dynamo chugging across the later 19th century like a locomotive in petticoats.

2008-05-19,Beauty and the Beat,"With her boyish platinum mop and her penchant for wearing leopard-print pants with silver oxford shoes, the model Agyness Deyn is used to stopping people dead in their tracks. But recently it’s her G4530 Wild West Sweethearts guitar, from the Gretsch Americana limited-edition series, that’s been getting all the attention. “I carry it on my back everywhere I go,” she explains. “When I’m wearing it, people just come up to me and start chatting about it. I get to meet some cool people that way.” For Deyn, who is a new face for Shiseido and a Burberry favorite, crisscrossing the globe is all in a day’s work. In fact, she got her acoustic shredder last year in Japan, a surprise gift picked up by her boyfriend Josh Hubbard (of the band the Paddingtons). The guitar’s compact size makes it easy for lugging on the road, and the campy aesthetic perfectly riffs on Deyn’s own Paris-meets-Lower East Side style. “I love the whole Wild West thing. It reminds me of a Sailor Jerry tattoo,” she says. But Deyn’s love for her little red six-string is no passing fancy. “I think I’ll have it forever.” ",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/style/tmagazine/18timeless.html

But its showstopper is the Fig Leaf wardrobe by Tord Boontje, who helped make a black-clad design world learn to love flora and fauna some years back. The wardrobe’s hand-forged ironwork structure is adorned with 616 individually attached leaves, each of which is hand-enameled on both the front and back and signed by its respective enameler. Inside is a cast-bronze tree, the branches of which offer a poetic alternative to the conventional hanging rod.

In 1972, the Club of Rome published, to much hoopla, a book entitled “Limits to Growth.” The thesis: There are too many people and too few natural resources to go around. In 1978, Mr. Smith, my sixth-grade science teacher, proclaimed that there was sufficient petroleum to last 25 to 30 years. Well, as Yogi Berra once may have said, “It’s hard to make predictions, especially about the future.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Gross-t.html

Support prevention programs that start early, are rooted in community values and resources and are sustained over time. Focus on resources instead of deficits; embrace the hopes, skills and positive values of youth and communities, and build on that foundation. Teach alternatives to violence: anger management, empathy, communication, cooperation, conflict resolution and active community engagement help young people not only avoid violence; they also help inoculate them against the hopelessness that breeds these cycles.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/magazine/18letters-t-001.html

Sixty-four and unmarried, Addison lives near the beach with her housekeeper and her dachshunds in a sprawling, Hitchcockian mansion called Wit’s End (one, but not the only, justification for the book’s title). The house, which would make a fine up-coast annex to Disneyland, is littered with cutesy-macabre dollhouses  on a bedside table, in a kitchen corner, by the sink, on a shelf  each a “meticulous replica” of a murder scene from one of Addison’s detective novels. Every diorama comes with a miniature corpse, wee props (a toy blue convertible, a cummerbund the size of a twist-tie, a lipstick slightly larger than a grain of rice), “right down to its tiny clues and tiny gore.” Addison likes to entertain her friends or fans (there’s no difference  everyone she knows is obsessed with her genius and possesses an exhaustive mental concordance of her oeuvre) by sharing personal anecdotes; ruminating on admirers of her fictional detective, Maxwell Lane; and fulminating on Bush-era politics.

A fresher wound came in 2001, when Naipaul omitted any mention of Trinidad from his initial press release after winning the Nobel Prize, which many here saw as a deliberate rebuff.

2008-05-19,Foreign Intelligence,"When in Rome, why not eat as the Romans (really) do? One of the surest ways to get off the tourist grid is to read local guidebooks. Never mind if you don’t speak their language  a handful of guides to Italy and France have symbols, numerical ratings and pictures that will steer you toward your next discovery. “Osterie d’Italia,” from Slow Food Italy, recommends restaurants, organized geographically, with a snail icon to indicate that they follow Slow Food principles. If you like nonna-in-the-cucina places, it’s worth the weight. Another Italian bible, “Ristoranti d’Italia del Gambero Rosso,” groups restaurants, trattorias and wine bars regionally. A numerical score is based on a 100-point scale, and a meter indicates value for your money. But the most important symbols are the forks (for restaurants) and shrimps (for wine bars): if you see a place with three, go. In France, “Carnet de Route Omnivore” is for anyone serious about 21st-century French cuisine. The annual book lists 200 experimental restaurants and highlights the best dish at each (under the heading “Le Plat qui Change Tout”). Accompanying recommendations of nearby hotels are a bonus. The same publisher also recently released “Carnet de Vigne Omnivore,” a guide to 200 small, artisanal vineyards, with handy regional maps. And for architecture, art and history lovers, there’s “Ouverts au Public: Le Guide du Patrimoine en France,” which provides visiting information, photos and maps for more than 2,500 state-protected monuments.

Delight may not be the first word you’d associate with his shabby rooming houses, seedy movie theaters, empty restaurants on lonely side streets, dusty stores about to go out of business, bare trees. But if the scenery comes out of Edward Hopper, complete with the aura of loneliness and of ordinary things made strange by odd slants of light, the people who live there are nothing like Hopper’s doughy American depressives. They’re characters from Eastern European folk tales or Kafka, boiling with energy, nicely poised between the comic and the sinister and prone to metamorphosis: an opera singer keeps “a monkey dressed in baby clothes,” a woman “turned into a black cat / and I ran after you on all fours.” Even Grandmother  and Simic’s poems are full of grandmothers  “knitted / With a ball of black yarn.” The fun  and Simic’s poetry is nothing if not amusing  comes from the way he puts together the whimsical, the earthy, the banal and the transcendent.

2008-05-19,The Long Shadow,"Strange to think that Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton University, would embrace Ronald Reagan as the historic alpha dog of postmodern American politics. For starters, Wilentz was trained as a Jacksonian-era scholar; the 20th and 21st centuries aren’t his bailiwicks. Then, back in 1998, Wilentz testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the impeachment of Bill Clinton was an abomination. He also endorsed Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008. Considered by some the heir apparent to Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Wilentz is perceived more as an erudite spokesman for the Democratic Party than as a judicious analyst of the Republican agenda. Yet in “The Age of Reagan”  a smart and accessible overview of the long shadow cast by our 40th president  Wilentz largely abandons partisanship in favor of professionalism.

Effects pedals, instrument cables, patch cords and microphone stands took up most of the space, radiating out from the laptop and sound card that Pallett was fussing over, and an ominous hum filled the room. The amps were arranged in a loose semicircle, vaguely reminiscent of Stonehenge: Pallett spent the day before writing a computer program to coordinate the various outputs, and the impression he made now was less that of an up-and-coming rock star than of a crackpot inventor, à la Nikola Tesla, sequestered in his workshop. “Oh!

2008-05-19,Profit Honors Poet in His Own Country,"William McGonagall (1825-1902) may have gone to his unmarked grave a mocked man, ridiculed as the world’s worst poet, but when a collection of 35 of his poems went up for auction on Friday in his native Edinburgh, they fetched more than $13,000, better than the price (about $12,000) paid for a set of Harry Potter first editions signed by J. K. Rowling, the BBC reported. Known as the Tayside Tragedian, McGonagall, above, who spent much of his life in Dundee as a weaver in the jute mills, did not take up poetry until he was 47. He specialized in subjects like Scottish battles and Queen Victoria’s golden jubilee, as well as death and catastrophe. At his readings in Dundee, he was often scorned, and audiences were fond of throwing eggs and vegetables at him. Perhaps his best-known poem dealt with the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 and included the lines “So the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay/Until it was about midway,’/Then the central girders with a crash gave way/And down went the train and passengers into the Tay.” Alex Dove, of the auctioneers Lyon & Turnbull, said: “He was a confident gentleman who thought that his poetry was some of the best. He once walked all the way to Balmoral to try to become poet laureate. Unfortunately, the queen wasn’t in.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/books/19arts-PROFITHONORS_BRF.html

Mr. Kelly, 41, a Grammy Award winner, is accused of videotaping himself having sex with an under-age girl. Prosecutors contend that she was as young as 13 when the recording was made, between Jan. 1, 1998 and Nov. 1, 2000. Both Mr. Kelly and the woman, now 23, deny they are the people on the tape, and one of Mr. Kelly’s lawyers, Sam Adam Jr., told the jurors during his opening statement that the videotape is “at best a copy of a copy” and that Mr. Kelly was not the man on the tape. “Not a single witness can tell you that is him on the tape,” he said.

Marks were also drawn across the mouths of Elmer L. Andersen and Harold LeVander. Initial estimates suggested the vandalism would require restoration, costing several thousand dollars. In fact, the repairs cost $175. It took an hour and a mild solvent to remove the ink from the paintings. An investigation is focusing on students from Eastview High School in Apple Valley. Mr. Ventura, a former professional wrestler, called the act “despicable.” A fine and community service are the likely penalties for a misdemeanor of this type, said James Backstrom, the county attorney for Dakota County.

In a sentencing hearing at Federal District Court in Orlando, Fla., Judge G. Kendall Sharp gave Mr. Pearlman an unusual incentive to pay back his investors, offering to reduce the sentence by one month for every $1 million he repays. Mr. Pearlman, 53, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a Ponzi scheme in which he used fake accounting documents to lure people to invest in two companies that existed only on paper. Mr. Pearlman fled the country early last year, once federal authorities began investigating him, and in June he was found at a hotel in Bali, registered under the name A. Incognito Johnson. Larry Rifken, a lawyer representing victims of the schemes, said in a statement: “The Creditors Committee is delighted with Judge Sharp’s ruling today on Mr. Pearlman’s sentence and believes that Judge Sharp did an excellent job in maximizing Mr. Pearlman’s incentive to cooperate with the Trustee and the Committee in identifying, locating and monetizing any remaining undisclosed assets.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/22/arts/22arts-FORMERBANDMA_BRF.html

In “Avant Gardeners: 50 Visionaries of the Contemporary Landscape” (Thames & Hudson, $60), Tim Richardson, a British critic, examines gardens driven more by concept than plants or place, from Ms. Schwartz’s double row of varnished bagels in Cambridge, Mass. (he calls it “half Pop Art, half 17th-century parterre”), to more recent projects like Claude Cormier’s Lipstick Forest, 52 pink concrete tree trunks at a Montreal convention center, and Ron Lutsko’s minimalist landscapes in California. Mr. Richardson, who is as well-versed in 18th-century landscapes as he is in the primary colors of a Topher Delaney garden, matter-of-factly acknowledges that art must shed some blood to stay alive, which makes him a good Virgil for the journey into what he calls conceptualist landscape design.

Look how blood squirts out the side of his head!’ I see things different than that.”Speaking about the casting for his tale of four black American soldiers in Tuscany, Mr. Lee said that black actors appeared in war films too infrequently.“Clint Eastwood made two films about Iwo Jima that ran for more than four hours total, and there was not one Negro actor on the screen,” he said, adding, “There’s no way I know why he did that  that was his vision, not mine.” Mr. Lee also said that he was starting work on a documentary about Michael Jordan.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/22/arts/22arts-SPIKELEEPLAY_BRF.html

2008-05-23,"Celebrating an Engineering Marvel, Born in Tragedy"," The 125th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge is being marked with a series of celebrations, starting with a concert and lighting ceremony Thursday night. (Photo: Chang W. Lee/The New York Times) See the Slide Show  The Brooklyn Bridge: a marvel of engineering, or a death trap? Both, within the first week of its opening.  The  opening of the Brooklyn Bridge [pdf] on May 24, 1883, was a joyous occasion with ""two great cities united."" That 125th anniversary is being marked with a series of celebrations over the holiday weekend. But few remember that the bridge's public debut was marred days later by  a stampede [pdf] in which a dozen people were crushed to death, and 35 others injured. The May 30 mayhem was exacerbated by a false rumor that the bridge was going to collapse.  The traffic that surged onto the Brooklyn bridge as soon as it opened was overwhelming and dominated by pedestrians who were charged one cent to pass. There was room for 15,000 people on the footpaths at any one time (though overcrowding sometimes drove it to as high as 20,000).  On the second day, there was ""a crush of foot passengers from 11 o'clock in the morning to 7 o'clock at night."" The pedestrians ""collected at the entrance, compressed themselves into a funnel about 15 feet in width and then ran the gantlet, one by one, of the tolltakers.""  Until then, to cross the river, people had to take the ferry.  With subways now, it is rare to see such vast crowds on foot on the bridge, except in emergencies like Sept. 11 and blackouts.  The dense flow of people over the bridge made it fertile ground for pickpockets (newspaper accounts talk about a lot of men discovering that they were missing watches) and other hazards. Six days after the opening, the deadly stampede occurred.  According to the most commonly accepted account, one cited by The New-York Times, the stampede started when a woman fell down the wooden steps on the Manhattan side, and another woman screamed (perhaps because she saw the woman being dragged by a police office officer who had sprung to her aid)  But another version of the events, cited by The New York Tribune, and considered more credible by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, starts with a German man descending the steps when a pickpocket tried to steal his watch. His wife screamed, and the thief's accomplices started yelling that the bridge was going to collapse, leading to a rumor-induced panic.  ""Agonizing!"" read the lead headine from The Eagle, which devoted an extra to the panic. It also highlighted ""The Stairway that Led to Death.""  As The Times described at the time [pdf]:  Those on the promenade above the stairway,knowing nothing of the fearful crush on the steps, surged ahead with irresistible force, and in a moment the whole stairway was packed with dead and dying men, women and children, piled upon another in a writhing, struggling mass. Cries, shrieks, yells, and groans filled the air at the stairway, while those on the promenade above yelled and shouted as they were pushed forward and rolled and tumbled over the poor unfortunates who were being crushed and trampled to death beneath them.  The situation was made worse by ""a gang of New York toughs"" who formed a dense line by putting their arms on each other's shoulders and charged.  The police officers on duty didn't have the ability to shut off the bridge on the other side. So for some time, the crowd kept pouring onto the bridge even as people were getting crushed on the other end. Officers were eventually stationed in the middle of the bridge to turn people back.  To relieve the strain of people, a bridge employee found a chisel and a hammer nearby and hammered at iron bolts and nuts until he broke away a section of the iron fence to relieve the crush. Also wood planks were laid so people could walk over the fence.  The Times reported the injuries in graphic detail [pdf]:  The first rescuers to reach the spot found the dead and dying wedged together in the narrow space as if they had fastened in a vise. So tightly were they packed and squeezed that from dozens of persons blood was oozing from ears and noses. The bodies were piled four or five deep at the foot of the stairway and most of those at the bottom were women.  The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote, ""The sight was one that was never equaled for horror."" The dead were laid in a row, their faces covered with hats or another article of clothing.  After the bodies and the crowds were cleared, all that was left was bloodstains on the steps, mens and women's hats, umbrellas and parasols, and a thousand steel pens lost by a peddler. But the clean-up was relatively speedy. As the Times described at the time [pdf]:  An hour after the disaster the only evidence that anything unusual had occurred at the stairway was the opening in the iron railing where a section of the latter was torn away in order that bodies might be more quickly taken from the mass in the stairway.  Among the proposals to advert future disasters: tripling the police force on the bridge, accelerating the plans for a telephone connection from one end of the bridge to another, and removing the stairs in favor of an inclined plane.  And of course, lawsuits were filed against the bridge trustees.  (Photo:  A bird's-eye view of fireworks at the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art))   Anniversary Events The Brooklyn Bridge lights will be turned on from 9 to 11 p.m. each night through Memorial Day. The celebrations and observances include lectures, dances, performances, a film series presented at the foot of the bridge, information tents, guided tours, and more.

2008-05-26,President and the Play,"What can a popular ex-president do as a second act? Collaborate with his wife, of course  or try to. And in the former Czech leader Vaclav Havel’s case, return to his roots on the stage. Mr. Havel’s first new play in 20 years opened in the Archa Theater in Prague on Thursday. The play, “Odchazeni” (“Leaving”), is about a chancellor who must re-adjust to civilian life and the loss of power after being forced out by his former deputy. (Mr. Havel, now 71, whose last presidential term ended in 2003, has said he wrote most of the play before taking office.) It alludes to “King Lear” and “The Cherry Orchard” but has some postmodern touches: the playwright himself appears in a recorded voice-over. The play received mostly positive reviews in the Czech press. But this highly anticipated absurdist comedy was marred by some personal drama when Mr. Havel’s wife, Dagmar Havlova, who he said helped inspire the work, was barred from performing in it. The National Theater of Prague, which was originally scheduled to stage it, cited a policy against guest actors in rejecting Ms. Havlova for a role written for her. Mr. Havel responded by shopping the show to other theaters; citing health problems, Ms. Havlova eventually dropped out of the production altogether shortly before it opened at the Archa. In September the play is scheduled to run at the Orange Tree Theater in London.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/arts/24arts-PRESIDENTAND_BRF.html

2008-05-26,LETTERS: The Readers Speak,"Re “Information That Doesn’t Come Freely” (May 11):You write that “bad things can happen when a government tries to hide the records of its actions.” It is clear that this administration has no intention to serve the public’s best interest, but in fact is subjugating at all costs all that would counter its sole objective, namely the profits of its in-crowd.I have never had so many alarms going off in my head. America is in trouble! The only insights into the administration’s wrongdoings are the investigative and analytical reporting of the media.Thank you to the reporters Nina Bernstein and David Barstow, to David McCraw, a vice president and assistant general counsel for The Times, and to you. Robert PalmerCastro Valley, Calif., May 11, 2008 ● ●Re “The Preacher’s New Pulpit” (May 4):I strongly disagree with you on the question of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and The Times’s coverage of his recent public and television appearances.I felt that the issue was covered ad nauseam everywhere and ran 24/7 on cable news channels. Yes, it was news, but it became the dominant news of the week at the expense of other more important stories.I appreciate that The Times showed some restraint while still covering the story well.Elizabeth KilroyNew York, May 5, 2008 ●Your column about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. scandal should have also noted the failure of The Times to discuss the anti-American and outrageous statements of many men of the cloth, such as, but not limited to, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Rev. Pat Robertson, Rev. John C. Hagee and even the Rev. Billy Graham.While The Times has provided article after article about Mr. Wright (and Senator Barack Obama), there’s been far less coverage of the other reverends who have made similar statements. In the Week in Review of May 4, we read about the “fiery theology” of black preachers, with no mention of the many other (white) preachers who have said far worse.Where is the balance?Vicki G. CheikesBoca Raton, Fla., May 6, 2008 ●I was interested in the difference between the coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. in the paper and on The Caucus blog on the Web site.Perhaps you are right, and The Times should have reported more on the content of Mr. Wright’s recent speeches in the paper. But nothing substantial in the speeches had not been reported before, and nothing in them was not being reported endlessly on cable news. It seems that the story really was that Mr. Wright was saying these things again, which to me came through in the reporting in the paper.The Caucus blog, however, was all Wright all the time for at least three days that week. It was infuriating.The content of Mr. Wright’s speeches is available on television and on the Internet. How much of this do you want to put on the front page? The Wright story represents a great distraction from real issues, and it is entirely media-generated. Now, the media are a story, but they are becoming the main story. And that’s not good.Christopher WilsonMadison, Wis., May 4, 2008 ●While I very much appreciate your column about the paper’s coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., The Times was hardly the first or only media outlet not to cover Mr. Wright in a proper sense.

In Vancouver, “the neon mermaid over the fish place / looks best that way, in the rain.” At Coney Island, “a cluster of hip-hop Lubavitch punks” watch Neil Diamond (yes, it’s really him) amble past on the sand; in the American South, the poet imagines “pecans suffering /their convoluted slumber in the heat.” The poet’s interest in places spans the globe now, but it began with his native New Jersey, where (an early poem called “Poetics” says) “I have loved the air outside Shop-Rite Liquor / on summer evenings/ better than the Marin hills at dusk.” Few poets since William Carlos Williams have done more for the Garden State, or rendered with such mixed feelings what they saw there.

And as big as the lake of gold was, it must be only a drop drawn from the sea of the larger fortune — the traveler's imagination could not begin to grasp the size of that mother-ocean! Nor were there guards at the golden water's edge; was the king so generous, then, that he allowed all his subjects, and perhaps even strangers and visitors like the traveler himself, without hindrance to draw up liquid bounty from the lake? That would indeed be a prince among men, a veritable Prester John, whose lost kingdom of song and fable contained impossible wonders. Perhaps (the traveler surmised) the fountain of eternal youth lay within the city walls — perhaps even the legendary doorway to Paradise on Earth was somewhere close at hand? But then the sun fell below the horizon, the gold sank beneath the water's surface, and was lost. Mermaids and serpents would guard it until the return of daylight.

Ms. Salie, 37, a former Rhodes Scholar and actress with a relaxed, often irreverent approach, called the show experience “wildly fulfilling.” Noting that “P.R.I. hired me to get a hipper, younger audience for public radio,” she said, “I think public radio is smart to recognize it needs to innovate in order to survive, and I hope that it will continue to actually allow for innovation rather than just recognize the need for it.” P.R.I. is exploring continuing “Fair Game” online; the show’s listeners downloaded about 100,000 podcasts each month, Ms. Ward said. Ms. Salie said that she was interested but was also exploring television hosting offers.

While the high court has yet to decide if it will hear Bell’s appeal, it issued a notice to both the company and its disgruntled bondholders indicating that June 17 is available for a hearing and setting a rapid timetable for filings. A Quebec appeals court sided with bondholders last week because Bell had not considered the impact of the buyout on their holdings. The buyout will add about 30 billion Canadian dollars (about the same in United States funds) in debt to the company, depressing the value of current bonds. Bell asked the court to rule by June 30, the closing date for the deal. The bondholders, in a separate court filing on Monday, rejected that idea and suggested that Bell and the buyout group, led by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, should simply make the closing date later rather than expect the court to rush its decision.

2008-05-28,Donnie Baseball Visits Baseball Shrine,"Don Mattingly has played in or coached in more than 2,000 major league games, but he had never visited Wrigley Field. That finally changed on Monday after Mattingly, a special assignment coach with the Los Angeles Dodgers, saw the famous ivy on the outfield walls and heard the Bleacher Bums.“My mom always wanted me to play here,” Mattingly said. “It was day baseball. It was five hours from my home. You were close enough so that you could get home, but not so close that you would have people bothering you all the time.”When Mattingly, who played his entire career with the Yankees, was asked if he ever came close to playing for the Chicago Cubs, he said that he had not. Then Mattingly laughed and added, “Well, not that I know of.”As Mattingly and Manager Joe Torre drove to Wrigley on Monday, he told Torre that he had never seen the Friendly Confines. The Yankees played here in 2003, but Mattingly, who lives in Evansville, Ind., did not became a Yankees coach until 2004.Mattingly was supposed to be the Dodgers’ batting coach, but he assumed a lesser role so he could be home with Jordon, his youngest son. Mattingly and his wife, Kim, filed for divorce last November. Jordon is in high school.Although Joe Girardi beat out Mattingly for the Yankees’ manager position, Mattingly said he still wanted to manage. Mattingly said he would renew his quest once his family situation was stabilized. He will not travel to Shea Stadium with the Dodgers for the series starting Thursday because he is taking Jordon to compete in a horse jumping show.",Sports,https://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/27/donnie-baseball-visits-baseball-shrine/

2008-05-29,Restoration Row,"(Photo: A bison in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in North Dakota. (Credit: Dan Koeck for The New York Times)) PAWHUSKA, Okla. – It is hard to love a land you don't understand, and for most of my life I had no idea why anyone would ever live in the Great Plains – let alone love the place.   Flat, featureless, boring. Those were the words I heard growing up whenever someone would mention the plains. My view was informed by Dorothy's Kansas, which looked scary and Gothic even before the twister took her house and Toto, too.  But then I spent some time here, mostly listening to people in the twilight of their lives tell about the land when it turned on them, during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. At the end of a long day of hearing stories, I would go for a run in the wind, and sometimes get a glimpse of the magic of the place — a pronghorn antelope in a sprint, a sky blushing pink, the quiet when the air finally settles.   There are people with us still who remember the Great Plains in its birthday suit, grass as far as the eye could see, what Walt Whitman called, ""that delicate miracle, the ever-recurring grass.""   That land is gone to us, now. Once, the grassland in our midsection spanned at least 14 states, from Minnesota to Texas, the second biggest ecosystem in North America. It's gone because the grass was overturned and the bison were chased off the land and the riot of biodiversity that evolved over 10,000 years was replaced by a few commodity crops to feed us.   It's not worth arguing over whether this was a good or a bad thing, because most of the intentions were good, even if the excesses were bad. But it's always worthwhile to wonder whether humans can fix what they screwed up.   And here, just north of this little town in Osage Indian country, I saw some evidence that the land can be healed. I saw shaggy-headed bison and their calves, several thousand of them, in a setting that was neither park nor zoo. I saw grass stretching almost to the horizon, flowering in parts, combed by the wind. I saw the sun dip behind the lilt of the Flint Hills, closing out a day with a burst of color.   This miracle of restoration is the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, nearly 40,000 acres run by the Nature Conservancy. It is the largest protected remnant of tallgrass prairie left on earth, according the stewards of this land – cowboys with advanced botany degrees.   The conservancy bought this land in 1989 and then set out to bring it back. The two biggest missing elements – fire and bison – were returned. Both renew the grass, distribute seeds, and keep the carpet of big bluestem, wild rye and other species healthy.   The result is somewhat astonishing. Over 300 species of forbs, grasses and flowers are here. And while this preserve is just a patch, an anchored Noah's Ark of what used to cover much of the continent, it says something about restoration. Bit by bit, maybe some of what we lost can be brought back.   I say this at a time when nearly all commercial salmon fishing has been halted on the West Coast. What used to be a rite of the season – a taste of the wild, spring Chinook returning to the Columbia River, the richest salmon on earth – is almost a memory this year.   But look also at bald eagles that fly in all 50 states, a byproduct of strong laws and far-sighted bird lovers. From my house in a metro area of nearly 3 million people, I can see a pair of nesting bald eagles.   We restore things to the wild, and in time, they return the favor. Think of Nick Adams, the psychically wounded veteran coming home to the nurturing water in Hemingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River.""   So even with the sky here in Oklahoma rumbling and clacking, menaced by twisters rolling down Tornado Alley, there is just enough of the original plains at the Tallgrass Preserve to make flatland believers out of skeptics.   You can see in the remains of a day the reason why people who came here a hundred years ago were so lonely — and, also, why they fell in love with the place.

2008-05-30,Obama ‘Disappointed’ by Pastor’s Remarks,"Senator Barack Obama said Thursday that he was “deeply disappointed” for new controversial statements that a friend of his delivered from the pulpit of his Chicago church.   This time, the words were not from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., but rather from a Catholic priest who was mocking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.  During a guest appearance last Sunday at Trinity United Church of Christ, the Rev. Michael Pfleger delivered a blistering critique of Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. Mr. Pfleger, a wellknown activist Chicago priest and a friend of Mr. Obama, said Mrs. Clinton felt entitled to the presidency and was stunned by “a black man stealing my show.”  The remarks from Mr. Pfleger first appeared on several blogs in Chicago on Thursday, accompanied by a You Tube video of his words to the congregation.    “When Hillary was crying, and people said that was put on – I really don’t believe it was put on,” Mr. Pfleger said. “I really believe that she just always thought this is mine. I’m Bill’s wife, I’m white and this is mine. I just gotta get up and step into the plate. And then, out of nowhere, came ‘Hey, I’m Barack Obama.’ And she said, ‘Oh, damn. Where did you come from? I’m white. I’m entitled. There’s a black man stealing my show.”  In his next breath, Mr. Pfleger wipes his face and mocks Mrs. Clinton’s tears, saying: “She wasn’t the only one crying. There was a whole lot of white people crying.”  Before he stepped away from the pulpit of Mr. Obama’s church that has been under intense scrutiny, he added: “I’m sorry. I don’t want to get you in any more trouble.”  Mr. Obama, through a statement released to reporters, said he was “deeply disappointed.”  “As I have traveled this country, I’ve been impressed by not what divides us, but by all that that unites us,” Mr. Obama said. “That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger’s divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn’t reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause.”  Mr. Pfleger, who is the pastor of Saint Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago, a largely black congregation, said he regretted the words he preached last Sunday.  “These words are inconsistent with Senator Obama's life and message, and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them,” he said in a statement released to reporters by his church.  Mr. Obama was not present during the remarks on Sunday. Since he began distancing himself from his longtime pastor about two months ago, he has not attended services at Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago’s South Side.  Howard Wolfson, a chief spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said the remarks were unacceptable and called on Mr. Obama to more forcefully reject the comments.  “Divisive and hateful language like that is totally counterproductive in our efforts to bring our party together and have no place at the pulpit or in our politics,” Mr. Wolfson said Thursday evening. “We are disappointed that Senator Obama didn't specifically reject Father’s Pflegler’s despicable comments about Senator Clinton, and assume he will do so.” ",Blogs,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/blogs/29thecaucus-obama-ap5252.html

Just like a real audiophile, you furrowed your brow over graphic equalizers and studied up on reference speakers and multi-CD changers. If your life was going to include a party or seduction, you needed a stereo — and your choice of equipment made a statement. Then the iPod and iTunes changed that; for all but the fanatics, they took the art out of playing music in the car or at home. And then came that unromantic iPod dock: no longer did your choice of Harman/Kardon or a scuffed boombox say anything about you except that that you were lugging around some antiquated junk. What a comedown. The old rarefied knowledge — and finesse with the levers and knobs and high-stacked component systems — suddenly seemed worthless.",Magazine,https://themedium.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/in-this-weeks-magazine-personalize-this/
