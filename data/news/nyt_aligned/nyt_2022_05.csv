For a while, it seemed enough, as Ernest Hemingway writes in “A Moveable Feast” (1964), “just to be back in our part of Paris and away from the track and to bet on our own life and work, and on the painters that you knew.” That he mentions his painter friends reflects the artistic era’s ample cross-pollination among disciplines and alludes to its frenetic socializing — at those famous libation-fueled Saturday salons of Gertrude Stein’s, for one, where Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse would mingle with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound and Edith Sitwell. When the sun came up the next day, some would seek solitude, but others would head to a favorite cafe to discuss their lives and their work and what one had or didn’t have to do with the other.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/t-magazine/paris-art-galleries.html

Here, the tension was a child’s divided life due to a parent’s divorce, and the volta begins with, “But let me say ...” which prefaces the final beautiful five lines. Limón is a master at making a simple idea (that of hindsight, seeing the bright side of things) askew. “And so I have/two brains now,” she writes. “Two entirely different brains.” Limón gives us two brains in her poems too, revealing new ways to view the world.

The current fair doesn’t focus on European old masters, which is one of Tefaf’s specialties. However, there is plenty of blue-chip modern and contemporary painting, sculpture and design. Unlike most fairs, this one also has vetters: expert curators and conservators who analyze the works, authenticating them, but also assessing the quality. In other words, when a dealer tells you something is “rare” or “one of the only examples” of a particular type, they have back up. The current fair includes 91 galleries from 14 countries, with 13 new galleries participating in this edition.

2022-05-09,Candied Morels Are a Spring Treat,"On a 2019 trip to Northern Greece, lunch at Kanela & Garyfallo Restaurant, in Zagori, ended with a memorable dessert of candied chanterelles and thick Greek yogurt. It came to mind when Angie Mar recently served a savory foie gras mille-feuille garnished with candied morels (morilles confites) at her restaurant, Les Trois Chevaux, in the West Village. The morels, now in season, couldn’t be simpler to prepare; serve them over vanilla ice cream, or Greek yogurt. Melt one and a half cups sugar over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed, three-quart saucepan until it turns light amber. Carefully add 12 ounces hot water, slowly stirring because it may bubble up; cook until the sugar dissolves. Add five ounces rinsed fresh morels and a half teaspoon salt and simmer about 10 minutes until the mushrooms start to look translucent. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use; save the liquid to enrich onion soup or use as a poaching liquid for pears.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/dining/spring-morels.html

Limón’s consolations are small but strong, and when her poems look to the future, it’s usually in the service of creating a connection in the here and now: “Could you refuse me if I asked you / to point again at the horizon, to tell me / something was worth waiting for?” That “you” is all important in Limón’s work — a wide-open beloved who is us, of course.

But at Mexico City’s six-month-old Esquina Común — which translates from the Spanish to “common corner” — home is more than a concept. This hidden weekend lunch spot, operated by the chef Ana González Serrano and her partner, Carlos Pérez-Puelles, is run out of a roughly 550-square-foot second-floor apartment on a leafy side street in the city’s Roma district. The former living area is now an extension of the modest dining room, which can seat up to 14 and is decorated with family photos and books from the couple’s own residence. In a newly opened lounge just off the main area, Pérez-Puelles pours wine and mezcal from a hyperpersonal selection. González Serrano, who previously oversaw the corn-based offerings at the city’s acclaimed Expendio de Maíz, cooks in a decidedly noncommercial kitchen (her mother, Beatriz, helps with prep), serving polished yet homey dishes that, on a given weekend, might include cheese-stuffed plantain croquettes with hoja santa chimichurri (recalling the coastal state of Veracruz from which half of González Serrano’s family hails); a tostada heaped with buttery turmeric-spiked lentils that is equal parts Mexico, India and France; or Peruvian red rice with pork ribs and huancaína, a cream sauce she makes with poblanos, alliums and cheese.

The New York experiment turned out to be something of a failure, though, according to Ms. Wainwright; she did poorly in school and stayed out late, as if in competition with a father who was sometimes out even later.

Running the gamut between parodic faux-autofiction and historical fiction narrated by a bevy of marooned, increasingly dissolute Frenchwomen, the stories here are almost studiously varied.

The assignment revealed that strange way our minds work: how much music or literature can transport us to a different place and time as much as the destination itself. Who among us can listen to a song that we first heard, say, while visiting Rio de Janeiro years ago, and suddenly smell the salty air of the ocean or see the cramped and enormous city glittering against the jungle?

2022-05-13,Five Science-Fiction Movies to Stream Now,"Benjamin Cleary’s thoughtful film takes place in a near future that feels within reach: People travel on sleek trains and in driverless electric cars; they have cameras in their contact lenses. And while not widespread (yet), human cloning has become a reality. Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, effortlessly carrying the movie) decides to secretly replace himself with a duplicate so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son will be spared the grief of his death. Cameron elopes to a secluded facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a “molecularly regenerated” copy of his body. But then Cameron finds it hard to let go: Cameron 2 is himself — only one small mole differentiates them — and yet he is not, provoking complex feelings of fear, jealousy and defensiveness. One of the few people who understands the predicament is Kate (Awkwafina), a dying woman spending her last days at Dr. Scott’s compound after having been replaced in the outside world by a clone. Bathed in the cold palette and cool details (these characters listen to music on vinyl, of course) that are de rigueur for this type of arty sci-fi, “Swan Song” does get a little mopey, but it is also insightful about the difficulty of making huge decisions. And it posits a situation that may not be all that far-off.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/movies/science-fiction-movies-streaming.html

In total, there were some 134,000 reports of syphilis and 678,000 reports of gonorrhea. These were “stunning” increases, says Hilary Reno, an associate professor at the Washington University School of Medicine and medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic. “I can’t tell you how many primary-care physicians have called me recently and said, ‘I just saw my first-ever case of syphilis this year.’”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/magazine/sexually-transmitted-infections-surging.html

Violence is everywhere in “Heartbroke,” where an abusive father or husband seems the rule rather than the exception.

This chain of simple, bright spaces with a refrigerated wall holding prepared foods has 27 outlets in Southern California. Mr. Polk says there will be 60 by the end of the year. He plans to expand throughout California and on the East Coast, where he is about to open stores in New York, one in the East Village and two in Chelsea. From the start, his pricing has been flexible, changing according to the median household income in a particular ZIP code. (A serving of carnitas tacos will be $5.75 in the East Village and $7.75 in Chelsea.) As in the California locations, the food for New York is cooked and packaged in a central kitchen as portions for one person and with a four-day shelf life; preparation is done in the former Pfizer industrial building in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “Healthy food is more expensive than fast food, but a central kitchen drives down the cost,” Mr. Polk said. “We are still profitable even at the lower price point in some neighborhoods.” The company also has its own delivery team, and there are plans for two locations in Harlem, one near City Hall, one in the financial district and another in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

So he moved to Albany, N.Y., started catering and considered opening a restaurant. “It’s something I thought I could do,” he said. Now, at age 34, he is a restaurateur, specializing in Cajun and Creole cooking. He enrolled in an online hospitality business program through Cornell University, found advisers and a business partner, and then, because of Covid, was able to pick up a restaurant space at a reasonable rent. His sliver of a restaurant in TriBeCa is named for filé powder, the ground sassafras thickener often used for making gumbo. But he’s from Boise, Idaho, not the Bayou. He said he grew up eating Louisiana fare, which his maternal grandfather, Aubrey Gaines, known as Tiny, would cook at home. (Though he wasn’t a Louisiana native, Mr. Gaines learned the cuisine in his travels with a construction company.) Mr. McCree’s gumbos, including Tiny’s gumbo based on his grandfather’s style, are cooked to order in kettles behind a counter with a long row of tables opposite. They come with a choice of chicken and andouille sausage; seafood; all the above; and vegetarian.

The I.M.F. called this “A Proposal to End the Covid-19 Pandemic” and meant it. The organization suggested the global payback for that $50 billion program, by 2025, would be $9 trillion — nearly a 200-fold return — in just four years.

The project, which shares its name with her podcast, was put on hold for two years because of the pandemic, but it has now come back to life. It’s defined by bright, bold pages designed by Meagan Bennett, and features women in food.

2022-05-31,Taste the Rainbow This Pride Month,"June is Pride Month and to celebrate, the chefs Seleste Tan and Mogan Anthony — the owners of Lady Wong, an East Village bakery that specializes in Southeast Asian confections — offer a dazzling steamed Indonesian rainbow cake. The petite stack of thin, multicolored, slightly spongy gelatinous layers is meant to be eaten by peeling them off one by one. It’s made from coconut milk and palm sugar, and the layers are dyed naturally, with beets, turmeric and pandan; the flavor is sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a whisper of coconut. Twenty-five percent of sales of the cake will be donated to the Hetrick-Martin Institute for LGBTQIA+ Youth. Similar snacks, called kuih, are sold at the shop, as are rich desserts like a pandan tiramisù, a cassava cake and a passion fruit-calamansi cake.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/dining/indonesian-rainbow-cake-lady-wong.html

2022-05-31,A Precious Strawberry Drops Its Price,"Bright local strawberries are showing up on farm stands and in the city’s Greenmarkets. Like the Hudson Valley and Long Island, New Jersey is a major source, but not just for seasonal field-grown fruit. A couple of indoor growers, Bowery Farming and Oishii, are cultivating them indoors with no seasonal limitations. They’re grown without pesticides and are sold at Tiffany prices. Now Oishii has just opened a major new indoor vertical farm in a former Anheuser-Busch plant in Jersey City, N.J., and the increased production is allowing the company to reduce prices by about half, so a tray of 11 delicious medium-size Omakase Berries is now $20, or six for $11. The Whole Foods in NoMad, 63 Madison Avenue (28th Street), which opens this week, is selling them, as are a number of the city’s high-end food retailers. Oishii’s berries might be worth considering once the local season, with berries for around $10 a quart, winds down.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/dining/oishii-strawberry-drops-its-price.html

Mr. Rubin and members of his family run the company; his son, Todd Rubin is now the chief executive. Their focus is on issues like sustainability, green manufacturing, fair labor practices and the like. To commemorate its 30th anniversary, the company has introduced a new jasmine tea, Jasmine Pearls.

2022-05-31,"La Marchande, With Modernized French Fare, Opens in the Financial District","Nearly 200 years ago, the financial district was New York City’s hub for fine dining. With Crown Shy, Harry’s, Nobu Downtown, Temple Court, the new Le Gratin and this gracious restaurant and bar by John Fraser in the Wall Street Hotel, it’s heading in that direction again. The hotel, owned by Paspaley, a major pearl company in Australia, is in a repurposed office building with a mercantile past. (The restaurant’s name — “the merchant” in French — reflects that.) An elegant bar leads to a white-tablecloth dining room with an elaborate raw bar and a couple of semiprivate tables framed in heavy drapes. Despite the formality of the setting, Mr. Fraser hopes to attract what he sees as a younger crowd who live and work in the area, by modernizing the French fare that shaped his career in Paris. “I’m looking at the 21st century, using global ingredients, sometimes out of left field,” he said. He’s supported by his executive chef, Rick Horiike, who worked at Buddakan and Wild Ink. Among the raw-bar items and appetizers on the lengthy menu are beef tartare, asparagus or blue crab enclosed in rice paper rolls; littleneck clams with cilantro mignonette; and lightly seared duck breast, sliced carpaccio-thin, with a drizzle of fish sauce caramel. Main courses include sweet rice with mushrooms cooked in a banana leaf, a version of homard à l’Américaine made with coconut milk, coffee-crusted pork chop with lentils, trout baked with a basting of miso, and roasted or steamed Dover sole for two with vermouth-lime butter. Desserts include a floating island with Japanese-style cheesecake. Amy Racine, the beverage director for Mr. Fraser’s JF Restaurants, will oversee the 120-label wine list that, while mostly French, lists some Australian selections to honor the hotel’s owners.
