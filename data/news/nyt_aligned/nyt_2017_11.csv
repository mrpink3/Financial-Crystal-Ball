Schlesinger Jr., in “The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society,” published in 1991 and in a revised edition in 1998. From 1949, when he published “The Vital Center,” Schlesinger, one of the founders of Americans for Democratic Action and a confidant of the Kennedys, sought to defend his conception of centrist liberalism against the radical left as well as the right.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/books/review/arthur-m-schlesinger-jr-multiculturalists-monoculturalists.html

On the wall hung pictures of Wilson’s three young daughters; the windows behind her framed a gray sky that, as I arrived, was just beginning to dim.

Cogan dreams of earning a Ph.D. in philosophy someday — “after all this is said and done,” he says. Horwitz enjoys tracking various aspects of his life in Excel spreadsheets: restaurants visited, books read, jogs taken.

2017-11-03,A Beloved Boutique Owner’s Favorite Things,"“As a teenager living in Sapporo, I was crazy for Ivy League sweaters, tartan kilts and Olivia Newton-John’s Peter Pan collar in ‘Grease,”’ says Makie Yahagi, who has presided over one of Manhattan’s most beloved boutiques for over 18 years. Makie, her tiny SoHo clothing shop, is a secret address whispered from one stylish mother to another; its signature wrapping (a brown paper box tied with colorful ribbon and neon-hued feathers) is almost as famous as Yahagi’s elegant, minimalist and cozy kid’s wear: onesies, cashmere sweaters and bibs in sophisticated, adult shades of slate, mouse gray and stone white. In 1991, at the age of 23, Yahagi left Japan for New York City, where she opened a bakery with her then-husband near Union Square. But an old issue of Vogue Bambini inspired a new direction. “It had these timeless images of kids in outfits by Comme des Garçons that looked like wonderful school uniforms and papa’s clothes,” she remembers; she set up her shop eight years later. There, hidden like little treasures among her garments, is a selection of carefully chosen housewares — paper-thin Japanese terry cloth towels, striped porcelain bowls — that she finds on her monthly trips to Paris and Tokyo, where she also maintains a larger Makie outpost. On the days she isn’t traveling, you’ll find the 53-year-old flitting about her Thompson Street location, dressed in her signature uniform: a navy frayed-twill blazer and cropped trousers of her own design, plus a stack of gold-and-opal rings.

2017-11-06,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Miami During the Cocaine Boom,"For anyone who lived through the 1980s, the television series “Miami Vice” is the pastel-shaded, music-driven, drug-saturated image of the city forever seared into memory. At the center of this action in real life was the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, a hotel and club in the city’s Coconut Grove neighborhood. Roben Farzad, whose family immigrated to the United States from Iran after he was born, grew up in Miami during those years. His new book, “Hotel Scarface,” is a raucous history of the cocaine boom as it played out at the Mutiny. (The 1983 movie “Scarface,” also set in this period in Miami, was filmed mostly in California.) “All roads led back to the Mutiny,” an undercover police officer who worked in Miami at the time told Farzad. “The druggies, the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informant, cops — good and bad — were all there.” Appropriately, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, the stars of “Miami Vice,” also were known to drop by. (Thomas even lived there for a time.) Below, Farzad talks about the haunting image that got him interested in the story, the filmmakers who inspired him as he tried to recapture a time and place, and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/books/hotel-scarface-roben-farzad.html

2017-11-07,"The Lobster Club, From Major Food Group, Opens in Midtown","THE LOBSTER CLUB With the Grill and the Pool up and running, the third restaurant for the Major Food Group in the Seagram Building, the Lobster Club, is poised to open. Any connection between this new restaurant and the space’s former tenant, Brasserie, is tenuous. Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner, is instead calling it a Japanese brasserie. “I love the name, and it reminds me of places in Japan with similar names,” he said. The Lobster Club might suggest Japan to Mr. Zalaznick, but New Yorkers are more likely to remember an Upper East Side restaurant of that name from the chef Anne Rosenzweig. Now Japan prevails, with the chef, Tasuku Murakami, in the kitchen. There is lobster to be sure, seared on a teppan griddle, in a cocktail, a salad, and dumplings. But the menu is as much steakhouse as it is brasserie, with a long list of sushi and sashimi items as well. The restaurant, which cost $10 million to design and build and was done by the designer Peter Marino, who also created the colorful tableware, is as much inviting lounge as it is restaurant. Framed by a long, bright bar along one side with flooring that suggests Jackson Pollock’s work, some of the midcentury Modern style furnishings upholstered in pink and chartreuse are low, conducive to drinking and snacking. Off to one side is another dining room, which can be closed for private parties, done in vibrant red and adorned with Mr. Marino’s interpretations of Picasso sculptures. (Opens Friday): 98 East 53rd Street, 212-375-9001, thelobsterclub.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/lobster-club-nyc-restaurant-openings.html

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/murder-on-the-orient-express-review-kenneth-branagh.html

The movie is widely considered a classic of contemporary Japanese erotica, but it has always been remarkable to me for its title alone, which seems a perfect expression of the sensations we encounter when we travel somewhere foreign. It’s hardly original to assert that of all the ways we experience place, sight is perhaps the least important; the thing that convinces me I’m actually in Japan, for example, is never the slur of neon outside the Tokyo-bound train’s windows, but the perfume of soy sauce, cooking oil and burning cedar that is particular to the country. The same is true with Delhi: You step through the airport doors, and there it is — singed rubber, wet concrete, damp loam, roasting cardamom. These days, thanks to the ongoing globalization (or democratization, depending on your perspective) of fashion and music, many cities can look, and sound, very much alike.

That precept feels particularly important to me because many of the stories I oversee are about science and technology, two subjects where it can be easy for journalists to get too far ahead of the facts. A new study might suggest some scientific breakthrough is on the horizon, but The Times should never cover it in a way that seems to imply it’s already here. In my previous job, at Wired magazine, my colleagues and I had one example of hyperactive prognostication that we used as a running joke: “commuting in dirigibles.” That absurd mental image was a stand-in for all the other ridiculous sci-fi fantasies that, cool as they may look on a magazine cover, have basically no chance of arriving.",Times Insider,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/insider/times-magazine-driverless-autonomous-cars-future.html

For his new book, “American Witness,” Mr. Smith chose a far more reclusive subject — the Swiss-born photographer and filmmaker Robert Frank, best known for “The Americans,” a groundbreaking 1959 book of black-and-white photos that offered an unvarnished look at the country at midcentury. (“I’ve always wished I could write songs the way he takes pictures,” Bruce Springsteen once said.) Mr. Frank, now in his 90s, was an integral part of the cultural churn of New York City in the 1950s and ’60s. Mr. Smith writes of “The Americans” in his biography: “Robert Frank wants to connect with his country,” and “he hunts for a shared identity. But he also wants to be profoundly lost and unknown. He lives in the street and yearns to move silently among people who don’t recognize him.” Below, Mr. Smith talks about first learning of Mr. Frank in a rock magazine in the 1970s, how “American Witness” became darker and more ambiguous as he wrote it, his fascination with one of the Three Stooges, and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/books/tell-us-5-things-about-your-book-capturing-the-elusive-robert-frank.html

Many people in both parties believe the tax code needs to be modernized, especially regarding how businesses are taxed. Yet the policy choices Republicans have pursued in their grand reformation of business taxation reflect a pre-digital, pre-global economy. With their bill, they may well ensure that the United States economy is left behind once and for all.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/opinion/republican-tax-plan-economy.html

2017-11-15,How to Fix the Republican Tax Plan,"Back when congressional Republicans were rolling out one unpopular health care bill after another, it was a challenge to come up with constructive advice on how to fix their efforts. That’s because Republicans had set themselves an impossible task with health reform: They were trying to do something sweeping enough to be called “repeal,” modest enough to keep most of Obamacare’s beneficiaries on the insurance rolls and also money-saving enough to provide some extra budget room for the eternal dream of tax cuts. No plan could satisfy all three requirements; as they say in Susan Collins’s Maine, you can’t get there from here.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/opinion/republican-tax-plan.html

It was in this spirit that the American philosopher Josiah Royce attempted, early in the 20th century, to pin down the true meaning of loyalty. Royce believed loyalty to be the cornerstone of human goodness, the quality that allowed us to rise above individual squabbles and gather together with communal purpose.

The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup.

2017-11-15,3 Designers Creating Clothes for Life — Not the Runway,"There’s a certain type of woman who is always dressed in something stylish but not fashionable, expensive but never ostentatious, exquisite yet hard to place: some thoughtful, meticulously cut piece of clothing that channels the contemporary moment while remaining aloof to trends. It’s made of pure, papery crisp cotton, supple linen or the softest Italian wool. It’s capacious and effortless, since anything too structured, too clingy or contrived, would be trying too hard. This woman tends to work in a creative field — she’s a chef, a landscape architect, an artist, a curator, an editor — and her personal life, too, has a certain ease. She spends weekends in the garden and throws impromptu dinner parties and would rather wear a roomy dress than forgo a homemade piece of rhubarb pie. You’ll never see her wearing visible logos (or even identifiable trends), but if you ask her what she’s wearing, she’ll likely name one of a cohort of independent designers who have built a business for themselves, in some cases over decades, by quietly and consistently working outside the realm of mainstream luxury fashion. These designers don’t hold runway shows on the fashion-week schedule ... if they hold them at all. They don’t advertise or market themselves. Most of them avoid press entirely. (You get the sense that promotion, like tight clothes, would be in poor taste.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/t-magazine/slow-fashion-designers-casey-casey-egg-sofie-dhoore.html

Circumstantially, they have countless reasons, as the Menendez brothers had theirs. But as the Pulitzer-winning writer Richard Rhodes argues in his book “Why They Kill,” the popular notion that any regular person is capable of killing under the right circumstances is likely false — it takes a lot to turn someone into a killer. Even seemingly obvious exceptions dissolve under scrutiny. Pointing to a study of 27,574 muskets recovered from the battlefield at Gettysburg, Rhodes notes that nearly 90 percent of the weapons, which are muzzle-loaded and fired one round at a time, were found still loaded. Over 12,000 of them were found still packed with more than one musket ball, some with as many as ten. It’s one thing to load a weapon — no one wants to look like a coward in battle. It’s another to actually look in someone’s eyes and shoot him.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/arts/television/law-order-true-crime-menendez-murders-recap-season-1-episode-8.html

It takes itself very seriously in a way that is sometimes tedious when you are young and full of the future, but is perfect when you are entering middle age and walking down cobblestone streets and missing someone you loved very much, particularly if that someone lived there. Paris is tonally at its most appropriate when you realize that somehow that someone, who was so intricately woven into the city — someone who, for you, was Paris — is no longer there and yet the city remains itself. The city somehow survives. But Paris absorbs your sadness like it has absorbed hundreds of years of sadness.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/travel/paris-mourning-essay.html

It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don’t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner’s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past.

2017-11-17,Donna Brazile Says She Foresaw Clinton’s Defeat,"SPIN CYCLE: Long after the accidental celebrities of the 2016 presidential campaign have been forgotten — Ken Bone, how the heck are you? — any accounting of Hillary Clinton’s loss still has to reckon with the role of the Democratic operative Donna Brazile. That’s thanks largely to Brazile’s vantage as interim head of the Democratic National Committee, struggling to unite fractured and fractious constituents on the left. (Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.) So it’s not surprising that she would offer her own take on what happened last fall — or that it would diverge from Clinton’s “What Happened,” which mentions Brazile only in passing and is No. 12 in its ninth week on the hardcover nonfiction list. Brazile’s memoir-slash-analysis, the cleverly titled “Hacks,” debuts at No. 6 and claims that Brazile knew all along Clinton was in trouble. “The polls were unanimous in her winning,” she writes, but “I did not trust the polls. … I had visited states around the country and I found a lack of enthusiasm for her everywhere.” Brazile says she urged Bernie Sanders to “work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster. He might find some of her positions too centrist, and her coziness with the financial elites distasteful, but he knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/donna-brazile-hacks-campaign-memoir-best-sellers.html

2017-11-17,How to Save a Knocked-Out Tooth,"“The idea is to get the tooth back in the mouth as quickly as possible,” says Gene Solmundson, the dentist for the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League. First, locate the tooth. Pick it up carefully, touching only the shiny crown and not the bloody root. “Don’t put it in your purse or in your pocket,” Solmundson says. Adults and children old enough to avoid accidentally swallowing a tooth — every year in the United States, more than five million of them are knocked out — can keep it tucked inside their cheek. Hockey players tend to be impatient with midgame dentistry, even in cases involving a mouthful of busted teeth. “They just want to get back out on the ice,” says Solmundson, who has a dental-exam chair in the Jets’ locker room and is a founding member of the N.H.L.’s Team Dentists Association.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/magazine/how-to-save-a-knocked-out-tooth.html

2017-11-17,A Day in the Life of Tina Brown,"I’ve always kept a diary — I started when I was 10 and no one’s read it except for me — but, as time has gone by, just much more sporadically. What was good about the Vanity Fair era was that I wrote so much. These days, the only place I really do my diary is on my laptop on a plane back from Davos or L.A. or London. But back in the pre-digital age, I had those black-and-white marbled composition notebooks and new New Yorker eyes (because I’d just arrived from London) and I was so wired with everything I was seeing that I had a desire to write it, share it, impart it. I love reading other people’s diaries, too: Virginia Woolf’s, Andy Cohen’s. Chips Channon was a huge inspiration to me; the Tory M.P.’s diaries through the ’30s and ’40s where he interfaced between society and politics — it’s just riveting stuff. As for myself, I’m at my most prolific when something new is happening and I’m on my own somewhere. There’s nothing like that caught-in-the-moment, onrushing immediacy of a diary.

My sources ranged from books so rare and technical that I couldn’t get them in physical form — Navy deep sea diving manuals from the 1940s, for example — to literary classics I had never read, like Henry Roth’s “Call It Sleep,” Nella Larsen’s “Passing” and Luc Sante’s “Low Life.” In the end, fiction proved most revealing of the mood and textures and collective memory of the period — even a flawed novel could teach me a lot, and cheesy detective fiction was indispensible. I tried to keep all my reading together on the shelves of an antique desk I bought years ago from a relative. I would stand in front of the growing mass of books and run my eyes over them as I waited for a synthesis to coalesce in my mind of the many worlds I was trying to internalize.

The drug is approved for human use; “postapproval marketing” is deployed to commercialize the treatments; slick ads materialize on TV; fortunes are built.

Whether or not Irving Penn heard this advice early enough in his career to make any difference, he followed its principles to the letter — he seldom seems to have shot any subject farther away than about 10 feet. He made his living and his initial reputation from fashion and advertising photography, which is to say portraits and still lifes, while on his own initiative he made more portraits and still lifes. He respected and followed both fine-art and vernacular traditions, taking the mottled gray backdrop of early studio photography and making it his own. He discovered a daylight studio in Cuzco, Peru, in 1948 and rented it for a week, shooting locals, and then set up daylight studios of his own in Paris, London and New York to photograph people in the generally doomed small trades (glaziers, tinkers, rag and bone men) in their get-ups and with their accouterments — a motif dating back to the mid-19th century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/books/review/photography-irving-penn-khalik-allah.html

Maybe it appeals to me because I have more than a passing familiarity with the cow udder — even if not as an ingredient. My ignorance of its culinary potential, and yours, can be forgiven. As Cosentino notes, outside Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, udders have never been given their due, on menus or in cookbooks.

2017-11-28,A Designer Inspired by Italy — and Scandinavia,"“I’m a very curious person by nature, and that has led me in some surprising directions,” the designer Marco Zanini says. Indeed, the 46-year-old has directed a wide range of fashion houses over the past decade, from his revival of the New York label Halston to the French brand Rochas and the Parisian couture house Schiaparelli. Born to a Swedish mother and an Italian father, the Milan native has an aesthetic that marries a Southern European passion for color and craftsmanship with a Scandinavian appreciation for efficiency and minimalism. His influences range from Japanese metro stations to old masters; his Instagram account (@mzmarcozanini) is an eclectic anthology of images of ’90s fashion, Brutalist architecture, scraps of vintage fabric, even children’s toys — all of which inform both his apartment in Milan and his designs for Santoni. The company had focused on handcrafted shoes since 1975, but since Zanini joined last year, it has debuted a micro-collection of men’s and women’s clothing and accessories (many of them unisex) for a sub-brand called Santoni Edited by Marco Zanini. “Lately, I’ve been very set on leaving out what’s unnecessary,” says Zanini, whose pared-down designs, such as a cashmere coat reinforced with hand-sewn goose down and a military cotton trench lined in raspberry and chestnut Japanese satin, exhibit couture-level craftsmanship. “I like things that take a little extra effort to get or to make.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/t-magazine/fashion/marco-zanini-designer-inspiration.html

At Baar Baar, which means “again and again,” he dabbles in sous-vide, foams, gels and such, but they do not dominate the menu. His small plates, assorted mixed thali platters and bigger plates provide a range of flavors, including traditional (like tandoori mushrooms, Kashmiri-style lamb ribs and butter chicken) and innovative, like potato and bone-marrow kulcha, asparagus pepper fry with cauliflower mousse, and oysters with guava, chile granita with lemon foam. He makes liberal use of avocados and offers creative cocktails, some mixed with Indian spirits. “When it comes to contemporary Indian food, New York is years behind,” he said. The restaurant’s owner, Payal Sharma, is his partner, as are the owners of his San Francisco place, Rooh, which opened last February.

It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow.

2017-11-30,Review: ‘The Shape of Water’ Is Altogether Wonderful,"“The Shape of Water” is partly a code-scrambled fairy tale, partly a genetically modified monster movie, and altogether wonderful. Guillermo del Toro, the writer and director, is a passionate genre geek. Sometimes his enthusiasm can get the better of his discipline, producing misshapen (but never completely uninteresting) movies like “Pacific Rim” and “Crimson Peak.” At his best, though — in “The Devil’s Backbone,” “Pan’s Labyrinth” and now, at last, again — he fuses a fan’s ardor with a romantic sensibility that is startling in its sincerity. He draws on old movies, comic books, mythic archetypes and his own restless visual imagination to create movies that seem less made than discovered, as if he had plucked them from the cultural ether and given them color, voice and form.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/movies/the-shape-of-water-review-guillermo-del-toro.html

My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I’d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/t-magazine/malta-cultural-crossroads.html

I inherited both the passion and a large part of my collection from my inimitable Aunt Sue, the best library scavenger in the family. I think the first I ever received was a 1949 number called “Marcia: Private Secretary,” by the memorably named Zillah MacDonald; it dealt with government espionage and, if memory serves, the plot turned on watermarks.
