Near the end, there was a kind of apotheosis.

Stettheimer was a pioneering modernist and feminist painter who died in 1944 and for many years was little known outside of a small circle of art historians and admirers. Deitch filled the Gramercy Hotel’s penthouse with ornate furniture and cellophane curtains to approximate Stettheimer’s studio at 80 West 40th Street, where she hosted one of the city’s great salons, which counted among its guests the critic Henry McBride, as well as Georgia O’Keefe and Marcel Duchamp. (Stettheimer hosted Duchamp’s 30th birthday, a scene that she later painted.)

But most of the time, chants are familiar songs that have been adapted: “You might take a melody from a song you like, and you might just mess around with the words.” For example, fans of the Shamrock Rovers, a soccer club in the League of Ireland Premier Division, changed the chorus of Lykke Li’s song “I Follow Rivers” to “I, I, follow/I follow you, Shamrock Rovers.” (The same club has also been known to chant the lyrics to “Build Me Up Buttercup” without changing the lyrics at all. “They didn’t have their own home ground, the club went through all these hardships and the lyrics spoke to the hardships of the club,” Jack says.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/magazine/how-to-start-a-soccer-chant.html

2017-03-10,"Emily Coates’s ‘Incarnations’: Quantum Leaps, When Physics Meets Dance","As colleagues at Yale University, the former New York City Ballet dancer Emily Coates and the particle physicist Sarah Demers have collaborated on classes, lessons and a textbook. The course they designed and taught together, “Physics of Dance,” introduced students to concepts from each discipline using the other. Taking that teamwork to the stage, Ms. Coates unveils a new work at Danspace Project starting Thursday, March 16. Part lecture, part performance, “Incarnations” addresses topics ranging from Newton’s corporeality to the Higgs boson particle. An early showing of the piece, in 2015, included a winning demonstration of how George Balanchine, who defined a high-speed American style of ballet, finessed the physics of the pirouette. Ms. Coates will be joined by Ms. Demers and the dancers Lacina Coulibaly, Iréne Hultman and Jon Kinzel — and the music director Will Orzo. The postmodern visionary Yvonne Rainer, with whom Ms. Coates has danced, will also make a brief appearance.

But aside from what we saw, what we heard at the shows was especially memorable. Some soundtracks offered a direct connection to the collection they accompanied: At Chanel, for example, Elton John’s “Rocket Man” blared while a massive rocket emblazoned with the brand’s logo “took off” inside Paris’s Grand Palais. Elsewhere, soundtracks sent slightly more subliminal messages. Many designers opted for songs that were overtly political, such as David Bowie’s “This Is Not America” at Calvin Klein or Richie Havens’s “Freedom” at the Row. Many others featured music by strong female vocalists, such as Nina Simone’s “Funkier Than a Mosquito’s Tweeter” at Mara Hoffman and an all-out dance party to Christina Aguilera’s “What a Girl Wants” at Brandon Maxwell.

On a wide field, men are stooped over in agricultural labor. The field stretches a great distance back, ending in a line of trees that marks out the horizon. The men working the field are dressed all in white. They have long white sacks on their backs and white hats on their heads. It’s hard to tell exactly how many of them there are, perhaps just under three dozen, but the four or five in front are distinct. These men in front, in addition to being dressed similarly, are stooped in unison. Their faces are very dark, devoid of detail. It cannot be said with certainty that they are black men (they could simply be caught in deep daytime shadow), but they very likely are.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/a-photograph-never-stands-alone.html

Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. “The kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform,” he wrote. “The quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form.” The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise “journalistic conscience”; it had internalized a “racehorse philosophy.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/if-everything-can-be-weaponized-what-should-we-fear.html

Ticking off reasons ranging from his promise of a Muslim ban to his flirtation with Vladimir Putin, Wittes stressed Trump’s propensity for promising outcomes through force of personality rather than policies and programs. “In the national security space, it is a particularly pernicious lie,” he concluded. “Our tools are too dangerous.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/how-lawfare-hit-the-big-time.html

Maher walks a mile to his apartment — “It is my only exercise,” he said — in the Third Settlement, a grid of dun-colored tenements at the edge of the desert. After breakfast with his wife and two small children, he takes care of chores aimed at rebuilding his life — renewing his driver’s license, reactivating his cellphone; he visits friends and family and searches for a job in civil engineering, his occupation before he was clapped into prison. Whatever he does, he must be back at the police station before sundown. “Every second now is important,” said Maher, a slight 36-year-old with a full beard, large eyes obscured behind tinted yellow lenses and a gray woolen ski cap that covered his bald pate. “If I want to visit my mother in Maadi, I can spend three hours getting there and back.” The clock is ticking. “If I delay for 15 minutes, the police have the right to send me back to prison,” he said.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/how-egypts-activists-became-generation-jail.html

2017-03-14,The Ultimate Vanity,"His name is forever linked with Memphis, but Ettore Sottsass had a big life — before and after he organized the flamboyant Milanese movement that defined 1980s design. During the ’60s, he collaborated with the radical architects of Superstudio and created Olivetti’s iconic molten-red Valentine typewriter. He designed showrooms for Esprit and seminal furniture for Knoll and housewares for Alessi. After Memphis disbanded in 1987, Sottsass dreamed up this vanity, first introduced in 1991 but surprisingly relevant today. His signature postmodern aesthetic is rendered with elegant geometry, including an arched mirror frame fashioned from Alpi, a type of reconstituted wood pioneered in the 1920s, and gold-plated cylinders.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/t-magazine/design/ettore-sottsass-vanity.html

Taking a look at the elegant dining room designed by Michael S. Smith, and its château-worthy architectural details like engaged columns and egg-and-dart moldings, it’s easy to understand why it took so long. Past a leather-trimmed bar called Jacques (as in the artist Jacques Majorelle, whose gardens are a treasure of Marrakesh, Morocco), the restaurant has 75 or so seats, about 20 of them in a compact, skylit garden, and a comfortable library/lounge with a fireplace is adjacent to the dining room. Charles Masson, one of the city’s rare guardians of classic French cuisine and service, will run the restaurant. And, with Christian Delouvrier consulting and Mr. Masson’s input, the chef, Mario Fortuna, is creating a menu he described as marrying traditional French with the Mediterranean, even crossing the sea for an occasional taste of Morocco, with a tagine. Highlights include a rich onion tart, warm sausage with potatoes, risotto of wild mushrooms, bass with Champagne and caviar, and steak au poivre. There will be tableside service for carving a chicken for two and finishing a baba au rhum. The pastry chef, David Carmichael, will produce breads from grains milled in-house. “You can’t beat fresh flour for nutrition,” he said. A bar menu has lighter fare like chicken liver mousse and ceviche, but it’s not above offering a hamburger.

The exhibition revisits the human ordeal of World War II through previously unknown images of life in one of the many ghettos the Nazis built to isolate Jews and streamline deportation to concentration camps. These images reflect the determination of Henryk Ross, a talented Polish Jewish photojournalist and a rare Lodz Ghetto survivor, to document what he called “our martyrdom.” Between 1940 and 1944, Ross took carefully staged fictions of ghetto life that served as Nazi propaganda, but he also secretly recorded the grim realities of what truly happened. As the war wound down, he buried 6,000 negatives in the ghetto, returning after Germany’s surrender to find half intact. Ross eventually moved to Canada, where he died at 81 in 1991. In 2007, the Archive of Modern Conflict donated all of his negatives and contact prints to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which organized this exhibition.

But the high point is Mark Morris’s “V” (2001), an enduring modern dance set to Robert Schumann’s Quintet in E flat Major for Piano and Strings, Op. 44. “V” could reference the number five — there is the quintet itself — or the birdlike shapes the dancers make with their arms as they soar across the stage. It could be the victory sign. But Sept. 11, 2001, was on many minds when the work debuted in New York. Mr. Morris, in fact, dedicated it to the city. What else could “V” be? Peace.

It celebrates British cinema of the late 1950s and ’60s, not least the era’s kitchen-sink dramas. Such movies introduced the likes of the directors Karel Reisz, John Schlesinger and Tony Richardson, whose unflinching focus on the urban working class, depicted with a dignity and honesty, has fresh relevance amid contemporary America’s economic chasm. Friday has the singular “A Taste of Honey” (1961), from Shelagh Delaney’s pungent 1958 play. Jo (Rita Tushingham, a 19-year-old newcomer then) is encumbered by her slattern mother (Dora Bryan). When Jo’s romance with a sailor results in pregnancy, a gay textile designer (Murray Melvin) helps out. Shot by the cinematographer Walter Lassally, often in the smokestack-laden precincts of Greater Manchester, “Honey” could inspire 1,000 album covers for the Smiths. It runs with Richardson’s “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner” (1962).

Spruill’s “Divided We Stand” (the story of the National Women’s Conference of 1977 and its aftermath), and Tressie McMillan Cottom’s “Lower Ed” (a deep dive into students who attend for-profit colleges). Iconic buildings don’t just spring up either, as Wendy Lesser’s engaging biography of the architect Louis Kahn makes clear. Philosophy takes time too: in the 35 years’ worth of essays and fragments that make up “Other People: Takes and Mistakes,” David Shields establishes himself as a funny, vulnerable and humane 21st-century Socrates.

Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn’t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors.

Through never-before-seen footage and interviews with her friends and admirers, the film revisits Jacobs’s midcentury battle with New York City planner Robert Moses. Where Moses privileged governmental power (and his own), Jacobs favored preservation and the natural order of neighborhood life. In perhaps her greatest victory, she and her followers protested — singing a song Bob Dylan co-wrote for the cause — and ultimately halted Moses’s proposed construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have cut through SoHo and Little Italy and altered New York as we know it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/t-magazine/design/jane-jacobs-documentary-matt-tyrnauer.html

A two-level restaurant serving Mexican food in a shiny new office building is hardly cookie-cutter Midtown, but Mr. Stupak is counting on his approach to the cuisine, filled unapologetically with American and other influences — he makes no claim to authenticity — appealing to the Midtown set. “Everyone told me that I had to have a shrimp cocktail in Midtown,” he said. “I didn’t think so.” Instead, his freewheeling menu offers starters like crab nachos with sea urchin, chopped cabbage salad with toasted dried fava bean dressing, and nine different tacos, including a falafel one and another with spit-roasted beef that is a take on al pastor. “We’re using tacos as a gateway drug to get people to try other stuff,” he said. Some larger plates, including roasted red prawns with chipotle, and fajitas with black pepper mole, round out the choices. The design for the 150-seat space, by Glen Coben in collaboration with Mr. Stupak, is airy and bright, with a big bar area and a more intimate dining room and open kitchen beyond. Upstairs, there are tables on the overhanging balcony and several private rooms. All are adorned with Mexican art pieces.

The movements in “Folded,” an intimate duet, unfold with questions about — and contradictions in — personal beliefs and behavior. The restlessness of “ReComposed” pays tribute to the vivid hues and bold brush strokes of Joan Mitchell, an American abstract expressionist artist whose paintings can seem like whirlwinds of color. And “Possession” is inspired by the changing relationships in A. S. Byatt’s novel of the same name, in which two contemporary literary scholars find themselves increasingly caught up in the emotional predicaments of the two Victorian poets whose personal lives they are researching.

Once you determine your resting heart rate by making several measurements — count the beats for 30 seconds, then double that number — start exercising regularly for a long period of time. “If you’re a couch potato, your pulse rate might go up just by doing normal activities,” Elefteriades says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/magazine/how-to-lower-your-heart-rate.html

But it now comes highly recommended by locals for its growing food scene and small-town vibes despite steady gentrification. It’s home to more than a few hipster and creative types, and on one quiet corner sits a charming restaurant to rival any Brooklyn eatery: Wm. Mulherin’s Sons, which gets its name from the 19th-century whisky bottling and blending company that once occupied the space. Nearly every ingredient on its menu is made in-house, right down to the flour blends for the homemade pizza crusts. (Bon Appétit named it one of the 50 best restaurants to open in 2016.) And now, you can sleep upstairs — in one of the four chic rooms Wm. Mulherin’s Sons just opened as a hotel. They’re uniquely designed (and stocked with things like Kinfolk magazine and Aesop toiletries), and perfectly sized for longer stays (with full kitchens and even washing machines). The rooms are conveniently located above Wm. Mulherin’s Sons (for nightcaps) and around the corner from the La Colombe flagship (for morning coffee.) The most exciting part of your stay might just be checking in: Like at any old seaside pub, keys are simply doled out by anyone working the bar, so you can grab a pint before heading up to your room.

Her time as a free agent had left Chuck and Axe without the woman they claimed but could not possess, and her re-entry into their lives rekindles a conflict that circumstances had miraculously conspired to resolve. “Billions” isn’t a exactly comedy, but the psychology it assigns to these two Masters-of-the-Universe types emphasizes the absurd gulf between their intellectual capacity and their raw, bone-stupid masculinity.

2017-03-28,"As Baseball Considers Change, It Should Look to Its Past","In 1857, 14 baseball clubs met at Smith’s Hotel on Broome Street in Manhattan to draft a new set of rules and regulations. In an effort to make the game more manly and scientific, members of the Knickerbocker Club, New York’s most influential team, proposed that “the ball must weigh not less than 6 nor more than 6¼ ounces avoirdupois” and that “no person shall be permitted to approach or to speak with the referee, umpires or players, or in any manner to interrupt or interfere during the progress of the game.” Most significant was the rule that changed the terms of victory. The winner was no longer the first team to score 21 runs, but the one that accrued the most runs after the end of nine innings. The reasoning behind the change was simple and logical: Fielding, which had been a stone-handed disaster during baseball’s earliest days, had improved rapidly, making it hard for any one team to reach 21 before the sun went down. The modern nine-inning game was one of the first official attempts to make baseball games go faster.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/magazine/as-baseball-considers-change-it-should-look-to-its-past.html

The recipes will be featured for around three months, then other chefs’ dishes will rotate in. The first round will feature breakfast sandwiches from Alvin Cailan of Eggslut in Los Angeles; a ham-and-cheese on baguette from Eric Kayser; a burger from Jean-Georges Vongerichten; and duck rice from George Mendes’s Aldea menu.

2017-03-29,5 Brands Creating Streetwear for Women,"The brothers Jacob and Axel Hagg moved to Los Angeles from New York in 2012 — and a year later, they launched their brand, Brashy Studios. “There was and is a creative opportunity in creating a new women’s streetwear line not present in the men’s market,” says Jacob, who first moved from Stockholm to New York to intern for a creative agency before decamping to the West Coast. The brothers draw inspiration from the deep corners of the internet — as well as from people they find on Instagram, like the musical artist Tommy Genesis, an underground female rapper known for her rebellious attitude and lyrics. Though Brashy is geared toward female customers, some pieces in the collection — such as oversize hoodies, boxy jackets and roomy trousers — are intentionally gender-fluid. “For us, streetwear should incorporate something of an anti-establishment ethos; establishment can of course be freely interpreted,” Jacob says. The brand’s spring/summer 2017 collection — which is available now at Colette in Paris and on the Brashy Studios website — consists of a fluorescent-pink vinyl jacket and pants, a tearaway tracksuit and pieces emblazoned with the word “GIRLS.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/t-magazine/brashy-studios-mademe-unravel-streetwear-womens-fashion.html

I heard she has a smartphone and has been going to museums.” So even though the term is burdened with the yoke of the very thing they are trying to flee, members remain huddled together under “O.T.D.” on their blogs and in their Facebook groups, where their favored hashtag is #itgetsbesser — besser meaning “better” in Yiddish.

2017-03-31,In the Long Run,"What makes a story worthy of an entire book? This question arises frequently when I work with students who are writing memoirs, often after they’ve produced 20 pages of riveting prose about the most dramatic thing that ever happened to them only to find they’re out of things to say. When writing about yourself, it’s difficult enough to ease up on the pedal of self-flattery in the interests of truth. But to confront your story’s limitations head-on and admit it’s better suited to 20 pages than 220 pages can be a painful reckoning — though, as I tell my students, not nearly as painful as trying to spread a ho-hum back story into a thin layer across a whole book. As Stephen King said in his exemplary literary craft guide, “On Writing,” “The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/books/review/in-the-long-run.html
