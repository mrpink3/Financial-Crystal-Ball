It has sold a cumulative $193.4 million in North America, making it one of the biggest nonanimated hits of the year. “Dinner for Schmucks,” a comedy from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios, was a soft second with about $23.3 million. That film, which stars Steve Carell, must now hope to replicate the pattern of “Date Night,” Mr. Carell’s last comedy, which opened with a so-so $25 million but managed to take in about $100 million before its run was over. Angelina Jolie’s “Salt” (Columbia Pictures) was third with about $19.3 million, for a new domestic total of $70.8 million. “Despicable Me,” the animated blockbuster from Universal Studios, sold another $15.5 million for fourth place and a new total of $190.3 million. A whimsical marketing campaign for “Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore” (Warner Brothers) couldn’t overcome deadly reviews, and it opened in fifth place with $12.5 million.

Franco’s intellectual pretentions are celebrated and his eccentricities are smiled upon; Sorvino’s intellectual ambitions are used against her and her eccentricities mercilessly mocked. Anderson goes out of his way to insist that Franco’s academic work is legitimate; Corsello makes fun of Sorvino for talking about her honors thesis. Anderson takes a rueful attitude toward the gulf between Franco’s ambitions and his actual body of work; Corsello has a good time making fun of “Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion.” And so forth.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/sympathy-for-mira-sorvino/

Starck was so impressed by the work of the German student, Roland Kreiter, that he telephoned Alberto Alessi, the C.E.O. of the Italian manufacturer Alessi, and urged him to produce it. (Starck also hired Kreiter as an intern in his office.) By coincidence, Kreiter’s design, My Squeeze, is a juicer.

According to The Los Angeles Times, a deal approved last month by the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles calls for Mr. Broad’s museum to receive millions of dollars as the Grand Avenue Project moves forward. The redevelopment agency requires developers  in this case Related Companies  to pay 1 percent of their projects’ design and construction costs to create public artworks or support cultural sites in the neighborhood where they build. The deal, which was approved on July 15, includes the Broad Collection at Grand Avenue and Second Street as the cultural site that will fulfill a large part of Related Companies’ percent-for-art obligation. If the Grand Avenue Project costs its estimated $3 billion, the 1 percent requirement would generate $30 million for arts and culture, and Mr. Broad’s museum would receive about a third of that under the plan approved last month.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/arts/design/03arts-MILLIONSFROM_BRF.html

2010-08-03,Oscilloscope Appealing ‘Film Unfinished’ Rating,"Oscilloscope Laboratories said it planned to appeal an R rating assigned by the Classification and Rating Administration to the Holocaust documentary “A Film Unfinished” (a scene, above). The documentary, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, dissects a Nazi propaganda film that was shot in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942. In assigning an R rating, which requires viewers under the age of 17 to be accompanied by an adult, the ratings board cited “disturbing images of Holocaust atrocities, including graphic nudity.” Adam Yauch, an owner of Oscilloscope and its Oscilloscope Pictures operation, said the proposed rating would block use of the film as an educational tool. “This is too important of a historical document to ban from classrooms,” Mr. Yauch said in a statement on Monday. “A Film Unfinished” is to open in New York on Aug. 18, and two days later in Los Angeles, before a planned national release.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/movies/03arts-OSCILLOSCOPE_BRF.html

Most Republicans talk a good game about America’s looming fiscal crisis, but then dance away when the subjects turns to what, specifically, they want to do about it.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/have-republicans-learned-their-lesson/

2010-08-03,Return Engagement | Camelot,"In an extreme case of camel coat envy, a frustrated New York socialite who had long fetishized the trench coat Ali MacGraw wore in ‘‘Love Story’’ engaged a patternmaker last year to copy it in caramel cashmere, down to the patch pockets and double-wide lapel and collar (which, like MacGraw’s character, Jenny, you gotta wear popped). From Paris to New York, from Kate Moss to Blake Lively (who seem to be as attached to their fawn-colored coats as Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn were to theirs), camel is dans l’air this fall. Céline’s Phoebe Philo jump-started the trend last spring with the ultimate boyfriend coat, a honey-toned Crombie. Jean Paul Gaultier — in his penultimate, fall collection for Hermès — showed a three-quarter camel coat pinched from the guys, saving his most luxurious discursion for duffel coats like the ones once worn by the British Royal Navy. Michael Kors imagined a gender mix-up at the coat check, or maybe that blushingly erotic moment when a gentleman slips his camel coat over his date’s chilly shoulders. If it’s all beginning to sound like a male conspiracy, well, a lot of women’s outerwear in the buff register does lead back to the blokes. Think of the peacoat — and the polo coat. Around 1900, polo players began wrapping themselves in camel ‘‘wait coats’’ — patterned, essentially, on a dressing gown — to keep warm between chukkers. Later, women borrowed freely of the details: half belt, full cut, chest pocket. In 1949 the camel coat was the American coed’s favorite. Kors made winking reference to all that history, pairing a great big muff of a fur skirt with a camel knit tee. Among the other camel offerings were satin blouses and high-waisted slacks (Chloé), even a strapless dress (Gianfranco Ferré). But in the end, it was the camel coat that scored, whether sable-trimmed at Carolina Herrera or sleeveless at Alexander Wang. A real love story.

Salads were made to order, with options including pea shoots snipped from the plant, golden beets, prosciutto and poached asparagus. Bands took advantage of the full raw bar with oysters shucked on the spot and scallops on the half shell. Beach House dug the smoothie station, and fried Mars bars were a hit as Arcade Fire was getting ready to play Saturday night.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.’s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.’s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/phys-ed-how-much-does-knee-surgery-really-help/

Even in a family like mine, where there were many siblings (six in all) and little attention paid to dispositional differences, I stood out as a neurotic specimen. And so I was sent to what would prove to be the first of many psychiatrists in the four and a half decades to follow — indeed, I could be said to be a one-person boon to the therapeutic establishment — and was initiated into the curious and slippery business of self-disclosure. I learned, that is, to construct an ongoing narrative of the self, composed of what the psychoanalyst Robert Stoller calls “microdots” (“the consciously experienced moments selected from the whole and arranged to present a point of view”), one that might have been more or less cohesive than my actual self but that at any rate was supposed to illuminate puzzling behavior and onerous symptoms — my behavior and my symptoms.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/magazine/08Psychoanalysis-t.html

The garland of bright yellow marshmallow Peeps that graced Yolk’s window around Easter time was Cathy of California’s handiwork. Callahan’s displays blend elegance, whimsy and humor; her windows often include cheeky one-liners. Her current window for Market, which features hanging embroidery hoops festooned with paper price tags, declares, “Tag, you’re it!” She’s also an avid crafter and often makes the props for her displays. When a client wanted to buy the props from a display that was coming down, Callahan added a handmade craft business to her repertory. Her colorful vintage-inspired creations — like plump toadstool pincushions and bright butterfly brooches — sell out quickly at West Coast indie craft fairs like Renegade and Felt Club.

Or could Claire be projecting? Taking no chances, she hires a nanny, Lola — a mother of five from the Philippines and the novel’s other central character — to take care of Will and to lighten her psychic load.

The rating bars those under 17 from seeing the film without an accompanying parent or guardian. Oscilloscope argued that a similar film, “The Last Days,” on which Steven Spielberg was an executive producer, had been rated PG-13. Spokesmen for the ratings administration did not immediately respond to a query.

Mr. Coltrane, above, who turns 45 on Friday, comes to Blue Note with an established track record, having made albums for RCA Victor and Savoy Jazz. “Ravi’s a guy we’ve been watching for a long time,” said Bruce Lundvall, the chairman emeritus of Blue Note. The decision to sign Mr. Coltrane was made last year, he said, in the midst of festivities around the label’s 70th anniversary. John Coltrane was never signed to Blue Note, but he did make one important album for the label, the 1957 hard-bop classic “Blue Train.” And in 2005 Blue Note released “Thelonious Monk Quartet With John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall,” a newly discovered recording of a 1957 concert.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/arts/music/06arts-RAVICOLTRANE_BRF.html

2010-08-06,What the Great Recession Has Done to Family Life," Economists may assert that we’re in the early stages of a recovery, but surveys continue to show that the impact of the Great Recession on American families is deep, widespread and grim. A Pew Research poll published last month indicated that more than half of all adults in the U.S. labor force had experienced some “work-related hardship” — a period of unemployment, a pay cut, a reduction in work hours or an involuntary move to part-time employment — since the recession began in December 2007. A report in March from the Population Reference Bureau showed that more than 70 percent of Americans age 40 and over felt they had been affected by the economic crisis. Government data indicate that the net worth of the average American household has shrunk by about 20 percent — the greatest such decline since the end of World War II. Long-term unemployment — joblessness lasting six months or more — is also at its highest level since the mid-1940s. According to recent data from the Rockefeller Institute, 20 percent of Americans have seen their available household income decline by 25 percent or more.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/magazine/08FOB-wwln-t.html

2010-08-06,‘Marienbad’ Revisited,"Movies haunt culture like starlit ghosts, circling our collective unconscious. Some insinuate themselves because they are comforting and friendly, which is not the case with ‘‘Last Year at Marienbad,’’ a famously impenetrable monument to the avant-garde directed by Alain Resnais. But the discovery of six reels of behind-the-scenes footage from 1960 forever fractures the movie’s cool, calculated surface. With a Super-8 camera, Françoise Spira, a young cast member with a bit part, produced what seems like an amateur version of the film itself, her relationship to its protagonist, played by Delphine Seyrig, as intimate as Resnais’s. Spira committed suicide a few years later, and her celluloid diary languished until 2008. The movie’s second assistant director, Volker Schlöndorff, later turned it into the documentary ‘‘The Making of ‘Last Year at Marienbad,’ ’’ which Diane von Furstenberg toasted at her studio in June after a screening at New York University. Schlöndorff was there, as well as Jean-Luc Godard’s biographer Richard Brody, the photographer Steven Klein, Ahn Duong, Daphne Guinness and the documentary’s principal promoter, Bernard-Henri Lévy.

But other great comic novels — Dawn Powell’s “Time to Be Born,” John Barth’s “Giles Goat-Boy,” Gilbert Sorrentino’s “Mulligan Stew” — make me laugh less often than many other novels that aren’t in the genre. What distinguishes the comic novel is that it takes the spiritual rather than the tragic view of life. It tries to reconcile us to existence as it ­really is, rather than suggesting that we try to change things or chuck the whole mess. This is why Miguel de Unamuno once remarked that, given the choice between Christ and Don Quixote, the Spanish take sides with the knight of the doleful countenance. Christ makes us weep for this world, while Quixote makes us glad to be here.

Keeping faith with their native cuisines, the newcomers made a series of counteroffers — sauerkraut, spaghetti, borscht — that changed the national palate forever. Jane Ziegelman tells this story exuberantly in “97 Orchard: An Edible History of Five Immigrant Families in One New York Tenement.” Highly entertaining and deceptively ambitious, the book resurrects the juicy details of breakfast, lunch and dinner (recipes included) consumed by poor and working-class New Yorkers a century and more ago.

He’s a lecher, a racist and a dope. He reads books like “The Rise of the Colored Empires” and then declares: “If we don’t look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff, it’s been proved.” He never says anything original or interesting; he’s too stupid to realize his wife despises him. He went to Yale in an era when Yale was still turning out battalions of well-connected dopes, an era that’s not as far in the past as some would like to believe.

I saw a whore and an old man in a lunch cart, and God — their faces! I wondered what God was up to.” God’s purpose would remain opaque to Kerouac — try as he might to impart some glimpse of it in his work — and a dec­ade later he was pretty much a burnt-out case. Poring over his old correspondence with Ginsberg and others in 1961, he sadly wondered at “the enthusiasms of younger men.” “Someday ‘The Letters of Allen Ginsberg to Jack Kerouac’ will make America cry,” he wrote.

In a 12-to-3 vote, the appeals board of the Classification and Rating Administration, which rates films released in the United States, upheld an earlier R rating that cited the movie’s “disturbing images of Holocaust atrocities including graphic nudity.” Directed by Yael Hersonski, “A Film Unfinished” dissects a Nazi propaganda film that purported to depict life among Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II, but was later discovered to have manipulated situations to help reinforce negative images of Jews. David Fenkel, who with Adam Yauch founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, the movie’s distributor, said that the rating “makes it much harder for libraries to accept it” and that “some won’t.” The film is set to open in New York on Aug. 18, and is expected to play later across the United States according to Oscilloscope. Howard Gantman, a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America, which helps to oversee the ratings board, declined to comment on the rating, which the association confirmed in a brief statement.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/07/movies/07arts-HOLOCAUSTDOC_BRF.html

2010-08-09,Will Ferrell Gets a Boost From ‘The Other Guys’," Will Ferrell, right, badly needed a hit  his last outing in theaters was the disastrous “Land of the Lost”  and he got one over the weekend with “The Other Guys,” a buddy comedy that took in about $35.6 million at the North American box office. “The Other Guys,” which cost Columbia Pictures about $90 million to make, was easily No. 1 for the weekend and represented one of the strongest openings of Mr. Ferrell’s career. It continued a winning streak at Columbia, owned by Sony, which was behind the hit remake of “The Karate Kid” and also scored with “Grown Ups” and “Salt.” In second place for the weekend was Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” with about $18.6 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. This Warner Brothers film has shown remarkable holding power over the last month, selling a total of $227.7 million in North America. “Step Up 3D,” the third in a series from Walt Disney Studios and Summit Entertainment, was a weak third, selling $15.5 million and marking a low point for the franchise, despite having the benefit of premium-price 3-D tickets for the first time. One reason may have been marketing: “Step Up 3-D” was backed by dark, difficult-to-decipher images that baffled many Hollywood veterans. “Salt,” the Angelina Jolie spy caper, was fourth with about $11.1 million, for a new domestic total of $92 million. The comedy “Dinner for Schmucks,” from Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios, was fifth with $10.5 million ($46.7 million total.)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/movies/09arts-WILLFERRELLG_BRF.html

Directed by Thom Zimny, who has made several films about Mr. Springsteen and his band, including the Emmy-nominated “Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City,” the film chronicles Mr. Springsteen’s work on “Darkness” from 1975, after the release of his pivotal album “Born to Run,” until 1978, a time when he was prohibited from recording any music because of a pending lawsuit with Mike Appel, his former manager. The film mixes footage from rehearsals during that time with recent commentary from Mr. Springsteen and the band. (Above, Mr. Springsteen, right, with Southside Johnny.) “The fact that this footage has been sitting in a vault, and no one has seen it for more than 30 years is just extraordinary,” Richard L.

Now, another clever bit of personalization: Pesce’s new shoe for the Brazilian company Melissa — an ankle bootie composed of interconnected PVC circles, whose form can change at the whim of its owner with a swift slice of the scissors. Cut once, and the boot becomes a bootie; cut again, and it’s a ballet flat, a peep toe, a sandal or even a flip-flop. ‘‘This is the future of mass production,’’ Pesce says. ‘‘With the technology we have today, we can give people something that is half done and ask them to finish it.’’ Go to melissashoes.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/shape-shifters/

He was hooked. His collection now numbers more than 400 pieces. It includes brilliantly beplumed Amazonian bonnets; sumptuously beaded, cone-shaped royal crowns worn by Yoruba chieftains, adorned with birds (symbols, according to the show’s catalog, of “the mystical power of women”); a Burmese hunter’s horned headdress, designed to inspire terror, with a monkey’s skull posed atop a bit of bear fur; as well as more modest garments, like a simple cap from India, made of felted yak hair, to protect against the rain.

2010-08-11,Opening Date Is Set For ‘Spider-Man’ Musical,"The much-anticipated, much-delayed “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” with music and lyrics by U2’s Bono and the Edge, has been given a date for the start of preview performances  Nov. 14  at Broadway’s newly renamed Foxwoods Theater (formerly the Hilton Theater). The show’s producers announced on Tuesday that they had also set an opening night, Dec. 21. The musical is estimated to have a $50 million budget, the largest in Broadway history. Directed by Julie Taymor, the Tony Award-winning creator of the long-running musical “The Lion King,” “Spider-Man” appears to have rebounded from a production delay that involved scuttling its original plan to start performances last February. According to executives involved with “Spider-Man,” the new producers have secured enough financing for the creative team to begin rehearsals next week and commit to performance dates and a box-office schedule. Tickets will go on sale in September; an exclusive presale to American Express cardholders begins on Saturday. People who previously bought tickets will be contacted by Ticketmaster and given priority access for tickets again.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/theater/11arts-OPENINGDATEI_BRF.html

On Monday a federal judge dismissed a copyright claim brought by a writer who said that a scene in the 2009 film was very similar to his own original script, titled “Himbos,” Reuters reported. John Musero filed suit against Mr. Baron Cohen, in character above, the director Larry Charles, the producers Mosaic Media Group and MRC and others in March. Mr. Musero had claimed that a scene in which “Bruno” wrecks havoc at a fashion show because he is stuck in a Velcro suit came from a script that Mr. Musero had pitched to Mosaic, which later rejected it. The court ruled that the idea of a man in a Velcro suit was not subject to copyright and that the two works were not that similar. The protagonist in “Himbos” is chased by a rabbit and cats after rabbit food gets stuck to the back of his suit. “Bruno” shows its title character crashing into a rack of clothes and falling onto a runway.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/movies/11arts-BRUNOSUITISD_BRF.html
2010-08-11,The Drawing Center Will Stay In Soho,"After years of seeking a new downtown home, the Drawing Center has decided to stay put in its SoHo neighborhood. “The economy made us re-evaluate what scale of project we want,” Brett Littman, the Drawing Center’s director, said in an interview on Monday. “We’re like a nice small jazz club  the scale of what we do is intimate; drawings tend to be pretty small.” The center has 2,500 square feet in its main gallery at 35 Wooster Street, which it owns, and about 500 square feet across the street at 40 Wooster Street, where it has a lease that must be renegotiated every two years. Mr. Littman said the center was looking at alternatives to its secondary space and considering ways to better utilize its main gallery with a possible redesign. Until recently, the Drawing Center had been exploring a wholesale move, a search that included ground zero and the South Street Seaport and Pier 18. But now SoHo has become even more of a cultural haven, fueled by an influx of commercial galleries and the opening of the New Museum on the Bowery. “There is a kind of understanding that the circumstances have shifted and maybe this is a good moment for the Drawing Center to reinvest in the neighborhood it built its reputation in,” Mr. Littman said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/arts/design/11arts-THEDRAWINGCE_BRF.html

But he apparently wants a half-hour each week. Mr. Johnston, a bit player in the last presidential election, is pitching a reality television show to several cable channels. Producers are filming in Hollywood this week for the show, which would be called “Loving Levi: The Road to the Mayor’s Office.” That would be the mayor’s office in Wasilla, Alaska, where Sarah Palin got her start. According to the producers, the series would show Mr. Johnston campaigning to be the mayor of Wasilla, even though that job does not come up for election until 2012. Without a channel, though, the show is little more than an idea. Asked why Mr. Johnston’s show was publicized even though it lacks a channel, Canaan Rubin, an executive producer, said in an e-mail that “a pilot is in preproduction and several networks are interested.” The interested parties have not been identified.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/arts/television/11arts-LEVIJOHNSTON_BRF.html

I was starting to look like a mad professor: specifically like Doc in “Back to the Future.” So Luigi took his scissors out and tried to fix me up. Except — and this is the point that occurred to me as I inspected the hair in the bathroom mirror the next morning — he didn’t really take quite enough off. He had enhanced the style, true, but there was a big floppy fringe that was starting to annoy me. And it was hot out. So I opened up the clipper attachment on the razor and hacked away at it for a while. When I finally emerged there was a general consensus that I looked like a particularly disreputable scarecrow. In the end I went to another barbershop (I didn’t dare show Luigi my handiwork) and had it all sheared off. Now I look like a cross between Britney Spears and Michel Foucault.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/

2010-08-11,The F Word,"Fashion, which has always been as much a narrative about the body as it is about clothes, has rarely taken kindly to the idea of flesh. Much as we may wax nostalgic about the Rubenesque ideal or the buxom, wide-hipped wenches of Restoration comedies, in its modern iteration fashion has steadily downsized the human scale. Flesh suggests messiness, privileging the indiscipline of life over the fierce control of art, the unaerobicized body spilling over the contours of an artificial silhouette, be it Christian Dior’s New Look in 1947 or Marc Jacobs’s New Look for Louis Vuitton this fall. Flesh also suggests the threateningly female, moistness and blood, the hothouse clutches of a heavy-breasted mother  off-putting images for male fashion designers, who are more often than not gay. (Think of Karl Lagerfeld’s withering disdain on hearing that a German magazine would now be using only regular-size women in its fashion spreads: “No one wants to see curvy women. . . . You’ve got fat mothers with their bags of chips sitting in front of the television and saying that thin models are ugly.”) ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/t-magazine/22face-merkin-t.html

The plan, known as N.Y.U. 2031, calls for adding six million square feet of classrooms, dormitories and offices over the next 20 years on the core campus and other locations. In letter sent Friday the new alliance urged elected officials to have the university consider alternative locations, like the financial district, insisting that the proposal “is too much” and would “inalterably destroy the quality of our community.” Above, a protest at N.Y.U. in April.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/arts/design/12arts-COALITIONTOC_BRF.html

After a flurry of press in Seattle, her hometown, and in magazines like ReadyMade and Bust, she got a book deal. “Dare to Be Square Quilting,” published this month by Potter Craft ($21.99), is the result. Eagerly rifling its pages for patterns like “God Bless the Children of the Beast” — the title of a Motley Crue classic that Ms. Davis built a quilt around — this reporter found instead a fairly tame handful of designs. There’s a fine skull, to be sure, but also an owl, a deer head and a clock face, among other patterns that “skew more cute than evil,” to borrow a phrase from Ms. Davis.

The advertisement, paid for by the Association of Chief Police Officers, featured a narrator saying: “The man at the end of the street doesn’t talk to his neighbors much because he likes to keep to himself.

In the letter, the board cited several accidents in which young travelers were injured or killed. While the N.T.S.B. says children under the age of 2 “should be afforded the same level of protection as all other persons,” the F.A.A. has rejected the recommendation several times, saying that parents unable to afford tickets for their young children would opt to drive rather than fly, resulting in more highway fatalities.

2010-08-12,Backlot Beauties,"On a recent Friday morning, lit white by the California sun, Nigel Dare was sitting in his shop, fielding calls from a movie set. “Is that a Japanese line?” he asked the makeup artist on the other end. “Never heard of it. But you’ll have it by Monday.” Dare is the ultimate Hollywood candy man — a warm, personable guy who can procure Fria, an Italian makeup remover, if that’s what you need, or Collyre Bleu (1) for the hungover actor with bloodshot eyes. Nigel’s Beauty Emporium, along with Naimie’s Beauty Center and Frends Beauty Supply, is perhaps the San Fernando Valley’s best-kept secret: a treasure trove of rarefied cosmetics brands where Hollywood makeup artists go to keep the likes of Sandra Bullock, Megan Fox and George Clooney powdered and buffed. Here they can scour hundreds of global brands, including ones you don’t see everywhere (Embryolisse (2), La Peau (3) ) and the Japanese lines much beloved by the pros (KohGenDo, Kanebo). Here they can ask for and get Kate (5), the ultrathin Kanebo eyeliner that is barely detectable on the eye. Or the French — and much stronger — version of Anthelios, the sunscreen by La Roche-Posay. Or, for that matter, Labello lip balm (4), from Germany. Frends is the granddaddy of the bunch: founded in 1940, it catered to makeup artists who were stuck on a set for 18 hours straight and running on empty. Today all three stores are about turnaround, finding products anywhere they can and even picking them up at a competitor’s if they have to — which, for the right client, they will.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/backlot-beauties/

That posed a few problems. First, I’d never driven on the left side of the road. (Let’s just say it took a few days for me to adjust.) Second, Skye is full of single-lane roads with “Passing Places” — you end up playing a friendly little game with oncoming cars as to who will pull over. (Don’t forget to wave as you pass by – it’s considered rude not to.) And then there was the livestock. Sheep, it turns out, will move when you honk (though we did hear stories of horned rams doing some damage upon seeing their reflection in car doors); cows are a bit more stubborn.

The too-essentialist critique has been raised by The American Prospect’s Adam Serwer, among others, who scoffs at my suggestion that there’s anything distinctive about heterosexual relationships as heterosexual relationships: Every intimate relationship, he suggests, is “‘distinct’ in its ‘challenges and potential fruit,'” and so there’s no reason why heterosexual marriages as a category deserve to be singled out or idealized in any way. The too-complicated critique was raised by Matt Feeney, who writes (well, “tweets”) that “if there’s an Ockham’s Razor/Parsimony standard for ‘ideals,'” then my marriage ideal “doesn’t meet it,” because “any marriage ideal strong enough to function qua ideal, as Ross uses the term, would have to be parsimonious enough to allow gay marriage.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/marriage-in-thick-and-thin/

If this starchy, nearly two-hour allegory about human hubris bluntly addresses a historical moment when global warming threatens the planet and pollution is fouling the seas, its chilly, formal tone keeps you at an emotional distance.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/movies/13tales.html

2010-08-13,And ‘Work of Art’ Winner Is,"“Technically, you have an amazing hand, but it was your heart that really moved us tonight.” Those words, spoken by the gallery owner Bill Powers, are not ones you’d be likely to hear uttered in the real art world without a thick protective coating of irony. But “Work of Art,” the Bravo reality show whose first season came to a close Wednesday night, never exactly operated in the real art world. After 13 other aspiring art stars were dispatched with the line “Your work of art didn’t work for us,” Abdi Farah, 22, a smiling, sideways-cap-wearing painter and sculptor and probably the show’s nicest guy, won the grand prize of $100,000 and an exhibition of his work at the Brooklyn Museum, along with the accolades of Mr. Powers and the show’s other judges. (In true nice-guy fashion Mr. Farah said he would give his cash winnings to his mother.) The 10-episode show, partly produced by Sarah Jessica Parker, drew a little more than a million viewers at its height  not in the league of Bravo’s “Top Chef” but not bad for a start-up. The network has not announced whether the show will be picked up for a second season.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/arts/television/13arts-ANDWORKOFART_BRF.html

Ms. Guisewite, 59, said that the autobiographical strip has been “the most astonishing form of therapy,” but that her “creative biological clock” was ticking, and she wants to try something else — although isn’t sure what. The urge to spend more time with her 18-year-old daughter and her parents was also a motivation, she said. Carried in about 700 newspapers, “Cathy” is syndicated by Universal Uclick. Although the cartoon Cathy, above, is often frustrated by her overly loving mother, in real life Ms. Guisewite credits her mother with first urging her to write and draw comics. The final strip is scheduled for Oct. 3, after the end of the swimsuit season.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/books/13arts-AFTER34YEARS_BRF.html

2010-08-13,Chilled to the Bone,"“I had no name, no home in time,” thinks Arvid Jansen, the narrator of Per Petterson’s slender, subtly incisive new novel, “I Curse the River of Time.” It’s a statement that could apply to most of Petterson’s lonely Scandinavian souls. In his books — the best known is probably “Out Stealing Horses” — Petterson depicts a literal and figurative geo­graphy that, to American readers, might feel a little like the starker reaches of the West, a little like the stonier shores of Maine, a little like Edward Hopper, a little like Raymond Carver. His characters are decent, laconic and perpetually, possibly existentially, chilled. They just can’t get warm, can’t stay warm, no matter how hard they try. At the risk of perpetrating a geographical cliché, I have to say that Petterson’s world feels Far Northern to the core — windswept, dimly lit, its summers and romances hard-won, deeply felt, reluctantly left behind. Memory, in this unregenerate landscape, is often the only thing these people have to get them through the winter of their discontents. They hoard it, hide it, keep it close at all times. Petterson’s narratives tend to unspool in the first person, in hushed, confidential tones. Tight-lipped with one another, his characters open their hearts to the reader, making us witnesses to their most private selves. He makes the reader lean in, out of the wind, to listen closely.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/books/review/DErasmo-t.html

2010-08-16,Paolo Canevari | Playing With Fire,"If not for his massive rubber sculptures and short films of burning skulls, Paolo Canevari, 47, may have only been known as the ex-beau of a certain Yugoslavian performance artist. “For me, Marina has always been first a woman, my companion, and then an artist,” says Canevari, who separated from Marina Abramovic in 2009. Born into a family of classically trained Italian painters and sculptors, Canevari came to New York in the 1980s to assist the South Korean experimental video artist Nam June Paik. Since his first New York show in 1989, Canevari has produced politically responsive artworks in a diverse array of mediums: sculptures made of car tires, video installations and photographs. He even dipped a toe into the slightly more frivolous world of fashion after meeting Riccardo Tisci in 2007 to collaborate on a project for AnOther magazine. “He gave me a Givenchy haute couture dress and said, ‘Do what you like with it.’ … I burned it on a wooden cross.” As for the clothing he doesn’t set aflame, Canevari sticks to vintage. “I have a collection of vintage suits and several vintage motorcycle jackets … around 35!” Concerning the overall inspiration behind his works, including his 2007 Venice Biennale entry, “Bouncing Skull,” the artist is very frank. “Life and death have been a source of inspiration for centuries for artists,” he says. “I’m not an exception.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/paolo-canevari-playing-with-fire/

The spots  all featuring Mr. Fallon, who will host the Emmys  will be kept under wraps until after voting for the awards has ended on Tuesday. “Are they kidding?” an unidentified official from one network told the publication. “They’re running basically ads for ‘Mad Men’ in the middle of the voting process.

Perhaps the last piece touched by the designer’s hands, it was made by McQueen especially for his longtime friend Annabelle Neilson, and its only outing has been to Elton John’s White Tie and Tiara Ball in June. Neilson was notorious for wearing McQueen’s clothes and she did so with a fierceness befitting her status as his muse. A sheer black jumpsuit from 2006, a mere figment of McQueen’s imagination that left nothing to anyone else’s, generated reams of chatter and flaunted the designer’s devilish streak. Indeed he was often heralded as fashion’s enfant terrible No. 1. But in this simply elegant silk charmeuse gown with its collar of silvered feathers, Neilson appeared as the vision of an angel.

I called the store immediately for more information in the hopes that the price was somewhere in the realm of my Amex limit. As it turns out the dress is by Hervé Leroux, who you may remember as Hervé Leger, the king of bandage. The bad news? 4,630 euros. If this weren’t enough to bring a tear to my covetous eye, I was immediately reminded of another dress I couldn’t afford, in my fashion fledgling days back in the early ’90s, modeled by a smoldering Karen Mulder on the Leger runway. I kept a photo of it pinned to the bulletin board of my cubicle for at least a year. To be sure, a lot has changed since my first Leger obsession, but what hasn’t changed is that the man still has a way with elastic.

2010-08-17,Old Battle Rejoined Over Michelangelo’s ‘David’,"A longstanding tug of war has begun again between the city of Florence and the Italian state over Michelangelo’s “David,” after a report by state-appointed lawyers was made public. The document argues that although the statue was commissioned by the Florentine Republic in 1501, Italy became the rightful titleholder after its unification in the 19th century. At stake are both pride of ownership and millions of dollars in annual ticket sales. Florence’s mayor, Matteo Renzi, sought to rebut the claim, saying, according to news reports, that a decree issued shortly after unification granted the city ownership of the building where “David” was displayed. The national government’s lawyers replied that the decree made no mention of the statue itself. With its representation of Goliath’s slayer, “David” was a symbol of the freedom and autonomy of the Florentine Republic and an important source of civic pride. At a press conference on Monday, Mayor Renzi declared that “Michelangelo’s ‘David’ belongs to Florence  there are no legal doubts, all the documents confirm it.” Italy’s culture minister, Sandro Bondi, meanwhile, issued a statement on Monday describing the battle over the statue as “absurd and inopportune.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/arts/design/17arts-OLDBATTLEREJ_BRF.html

Many writers seem convinced that that assimilation and nativism aren’t intertwined at all, but rather diametrically opposed. “Nativism in the late 19th century was preoccupied with keeping foreigners out of the United States,” not assimilating them, Jamelle Bouie writes. “The pro-assimilation forces are on the progressive side, in the first camp Douthat mentions,” objects Phoebe Maltz, rather than having anything to do with cultural conservatives. “The assimilationists and the exclusionists aren’t and haven’t been the same people,” Jacob Levy tweets.

2010-08-18,Online-Only Art Fair Set For January,"The conventional art fair  for which collectors, dealers and other art world professionals jet into a city for several days of looking, buying, going to parties and networking  is about to face a challenge. The online-only VIP Art Fair, which will take place for the first time in January, is similarly time-limited (a week long), but different in almost every other way from a normal fair. The “booths” are virtual; conversation (and haggling over prices) will take place by instant messaging, phone or Skype; and no one will get sore feet. The event is the brainchild of two couples, the art dealers James and Jane Cohan and the Internet entrepreneurs Jonas and Alessandra Almgren. So far several major galleries have signed up, including Gagosian, David Zwirner, White Cube, Hauser & Wirth and L&M Arts. The cost to galleries in the most elite category is $20,000, which Mr. Cohan said the founders estimated to be about a fifth the cost of doing a conventional art fair (including booth, transportation, hotels and shipping). Asked whether people would be willing to spend money on art they hadn’t seen in person, Mr. Cohan said that buyers most likely would be people already familiar with a given artist’s work. The fair will take place Jan. 22 to 30. Anyone can browse, but to interact with dealers, you will have to be invited by one of the exhibiting galleries or pay a fee of $20 or $100.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/arts/design/18arts-ONLINEONLYAR_BRF.html

S. Eliot  and that’s just if he sticks to the lyrics of his song “Desolation Row.” So what will visitors to Mr. Dylan’s show at the Danish National Gallery in Copenhagen actually see when it opens there next month? As Kaspar Monrad, the museum’s curator and director, told Agence France-Presse, the works will include paintings of Brazil, like the one above, containing “scenes from daily life in the cities, the slums and the countryside in Brazil where Bob Dylan has been several times.” The exhibition, which will run at the museum (known locally as the Statens Museum for Kunst) from Sept. 4 through Jan. 30, was announced last year. The museum said on Monday that it would include 40 acrylic paintings and 8 drawings created by Mr. Dylan specifically for the show. Mr. Monrad said the paintings, whose subjects also include a familiarly Dylan-esque array of gypsies, gangsters and politicians, were “inspired by American realism from the start of the 20th century” and a “deep affinity” with painters like Matisse. In a statement Mr. Dylan simply said, “It was an honor to be asked and a thrilling challenge” to create the works.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/arts/design/18arts-DYLANSARTEXH_BRF.html

2010-08-18,Welcome Back | John Derian for Target,"September is almost here, with its cooler temperatures (at least we in New York hope they’re cooler) and, even better, the arrival of a new John Derian collection for Target. The East Village master of decoupage plates, trays, lamps and other decorative items has followed his 2008 effort for the design-centric retailer with a bigger, more varied collection that includes stationery, home décor, housewares and storage — all at I’ll-take-10-of-those prices. Signature designs run through the collection: for example, a silhouette that adorns the cover of a composition book ($2.50) also appears on a ceramic mug ($4.99). Storage bins covered in geranium-leaf or moth prints are too pretty to hide in a closet, and there are plastic trays for every possible use. My favorites among the latter are the Tapered Tray ($19.99, shown here in pale geranium), which is large enough to carry drinks outside, or to stack books or magazines. A smaller tray ($12.99) is perfect for organizing jars of cotton swabs and makeup brushes in the bathroom or for putting your keys on near the front door. Its image of a pink room (called House-Mouse in the collection), taken from a late-19th-century German print, is one of Derian’s favorites. “It’s so conceptual,” he said, “as if you’re putting your things down in a room.” And the oval tray ($12.99), with its Home Sweet Home motto (based on a print that Derian found when he bought an old frame), would look great hanging on a wall, with its old-fashioned, almost camp sensibility. Derian particularly likes the way that these pieces work in modern as well as more traditional rooms. “They all cross over, which is cool,” he added. The collection will be available beginning Sept. 5, but as always with Target’s designer collaborations, supplies are limited.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/welcome-back-john-derian-for-target/

With his new line, Noeud Papillon — French for “butterfly knot,” the double Windsor of the bow tie world — Wu has elevated the geekiest of accessories to I-want-one status.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art said on Tuesday that its recent exhibition of works by that 20th-century titan of creativity was its seventh highest-attended show in the museum’s history. The exhibition, called “Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,” drew 703,256 visitors during its 17-week run from April 19 through Sunday, making it the museum’s best-attended show since 2001. The Met said that the exhibition, which featured the museum’s complete Picasso holdings of some 300 examples of the artist’s painting, drawing, sculpture and ceramics (above is his “Seated Harlequin from 1901), attracted as many as 10,000 visitors on some busy Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Still, it wasn’t enough to top the Met’s sixth most-attended exhibition, “The Horses of San Marco,” which drew 742,221 visitors over seven months in 1980.

Ms. White — the “Hot in Cleveland” star, who will also be seen on “Community” and just about anywhere else that a television set or computer monitor is on — just signed a deal to write two books for G. P. Putnam’s Sons, the publisher announced on Wednesday. The first book, “Listen Up!,” is about “life lessons learned during her incredibly varied and long career in Hollywood, with an emphasis on the extraordinary past 15 years of the star’s life,” according to a statement, and is scheduled for release in spring 2011. The second book, scheduled for publication in 2012, is called “The Zoo and I,” and will have stories about Ms. White and the animals at the Los Angeles Zoo. (She is on the board of trustees of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association and an animal rights advocate.) She has written two books and was a co-author of three. In a statement, Ms. White said, “Much as I love what I do for a living in show business, I love writing even more.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/books/19arts-BETTYWHITEGE_BRF.html

NBC did not lead the 8 p.m. time slot, however, as a rerun of “Minute to Win It” (5.2 million) could not compete with ABC’s “Wipeout” (8.9 million) or CBS’s repeat of “NCIS” (8.7 million). Despite a line-up of all reruns, CBS ranked second on the night, earning 7.6 million at 9 for “NCIS: Los Angeles” and 5.2 million at 10 for “The Good Wife.” ABC was third with “Shaq Vs.” (5.1 million) and “Primetime” (4.5 million) from 9 to 11 while Fox placed fourth with back-to-back repeats of “Glee” (3.8 million).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/arts/television/19arts-TALENTWILDCA_BRF.html

In a statement, the company said: “Ms. Tequila was made aware, in advance, of her unpopularity with many Juggalos at the Gathering, but she insisted on performing. She was even paid in full before her performance, and was told that she did not have to perform, but if she did decide to perform, she could leave the stage the minute that she felt uncomfortable.” Juggalo Gathering LLC added that the performer exacerbated the situation when she “removed her top, exposing herself, which seemed to mock and further antagonize the crowd.” Tila Tequila, whose real name is Tila Nguyen, filed a complaint with law enforcement officials in Hardin County, Ill., where the festival was held. She has said that she required stitches after audience members pelted her with rocks, glass bottles, firecrackers and waste from portable toilets.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/arts/music/19arts-MSTEQUILAVSJ_BRF.html

The Arcade Fire’s album, “The Suburbs” (Merge), fell to No. 2 with 52,000 sales, a 66 percent decline from the week before. (Although sales for “Recovery” have dropped since it was released, they have held steady in the mid-100,000’s, and the album has sold a total of 2.1 million copies so far.)

2010-08-19,Strange Second Life of ‘Life and Times of Tim’,"A few weeks ago, Steve Dildarian appeared to be as down-and-out as the perpetually troubled protagonist on his HBO animated series “The Life and Times of Tim.” That was in June, when the network told him it would not be picking up a third season of that cartoon comedy, on which he serves as creator, writer, producer and the voice of its title character. Then, before Mr. Dildarian had time to gather his belongings or shop the show to another network, HBO reversed course and told him a few days ago that “The Life and Times of Tim” would be resurrected for Season 3. So why the sudden reversal of fortune? “Honestly, I don’t know,” he said in a phone interview. “Sometimes I’m the last to know these things.” In a statement, Mike Lombardo, the president of HBO programming, said simply that the show “has a passionate fan base both in terms of viewers and within the company,” and the network was “convinced that ‘Tim’ should be part of our plans for 2011.” Given that it takes about 10 months to a year to create new episodes of the show, Mr. Dildarian said he hoped to get back to work quickly. “The last thing I need is more breathing room,” he said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/arts/television/19arts-STRANGESECON_BRF.html

During its Broadway run, “Million Dollar Quartet” has had musical artists like Melissa Etheridge, Larry Gatlin and Guy Davis perform with its cast, but this guest shot is unique: Mr. Lewis, 74, the Louisiana-born performer of “Great Balls of Fire” and “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On,” is the last surviving member of the real-life Million Dollar Quartet, the serendipitous assemblage at which he, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins recorded together at Sun Records in 1956.

2010-08-19,Florida: Alternatives to Relief Well Considered,"BP engineers and government scientists are evaluating alternatives for proceeding with a relief well that is intended to put the final plug in the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, the leader of the federal response to the disaster said Wednesday in Cedar Key. The official, Thad W. Allen, a retired Coast Guard admiral, said there was no timetable for completing the relief well. But he said that in the meantime, BP was preparing to replace the damaged blowout preventer on the Macondo well with a new one, which could be used to help manage pressure within the well. BP has estimated that there are about 1,000 barrels of oil in the Macondo well, trapped between seals at the top and cement at the bottom that was pumped in this month. One concern is that using the relief well to pump more cement into the Macondo well could raise the pressure within that well, damage the seals and, potentially, result in a spill of the oil.

The two school systems, in Atlanta and Dougherty County, in southern Georgia, have conducted investigations, but Mr. Perdue said those were “woefully inadequate.” Atlanta investigators have already turned over the names of 109 teachers and administrators to the school district for further review.

That question gets explored in depth in ‘‘Brune/Blonde,’’ an exhibition by Alain Bergala opening this October at the Cinémathèque Française in Paris. Blondes, as it turns out, were most often cast as housewives until the 1930s, when flaxen-haired women became typecast as sultry and dangerous. A book of the same name will be released concurrently and include essays by film and cultural historians like Michelle Perrot, Dominique Païni and Stéphane Guéguan, along with an interview with Deneuve herself. And to get to the root (pun intended) of the issue, ‘‘Brune/Blonde’’ looks beyond cinema to the significance of women’s hair color in art (Alphonse Mucha, Francesca Woodman) and mythology.

The crostini was off the menu, and in its place was a special of figs nestled on a bed of ricotta, topped with spiky arugula.

2010-08-19,A Pop Cartoon Springs Out of the Playbook,"KATY PERRY was sinking. It was a listening party for her new album, “Teenage Dream,” and there was a beach theme, with palm trees, surfboards and gallons of sand trucked in to decorate a Midtown event space.

Ms. Perry wasn’t happy when she saw the small desert between her and her seat  “I don’t want sand in my stilettos,” she said, pouting, echoing one of her lyrics  but she is just a regular girl gone big, so she gamely tottered across the sand in her four-inch platforms, the heels disappearing with each step.

A Long Island-raised, Barnard-educated woman driven by a surplus of weapons-grade ambition, Eileen was already well known in the industry for being immune to emotions like discouragement. Also, she had noticed something pleasing about the style of the European girls — a reminder of how and why her company had already become the most successful of its kind. Long regarded for their sophisticated, heroically unapproachable beauty — an aesthetic that had been the dominant face of fashion throughout the ’50s — many of the girls now seemed to embrace a more wholesome look. They were pert and welcoming, bright-eyed and often blond-haired: eager, in short, to project a kind of dewy innocence. “Everyone there,” Eileen noted when she got back, “wants to look American.” Which was one way of putting it.

Who, these impatient observers wondered, would be cast in the final principal role of this production? Now they have their answer. Justin Guarini, above, the runner-up on the first season of “American Idol,” has joined the musical’s cast, Lincoln Center Theater said on Thursday. Mr. Guarini, who was beaten by Kelly Clarkson for the “Idol” crown in 2002, will play the role of Carlos, the son of Ivan (Mr. Mitchell) and Lucia (Ms. LuPone). It will be the Broadway debut of Mr. Guarini, who previously appeared in a workshop version of the Beach Boys musical “Good Vibrations” and with Ms. Clarkson in the film “From Justin to Kelly.” “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” is directed by Bartlett Sher with a book by Jeffrey Lane and music and lyrics by David Yazbek.

The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library will have its opening in November, where it will display first-edition books by the “Slaughterhouse Five” and “Sirens of Titans” author, who died in 2007, as well as a replica of his writing studio, items he collected during his service in World War II and numerous rejection letters he received before achieving his literary fame. “We have boxes of rejection letters,” Edie Vonnegut, the author’s oldest daughter, told The A.P., “letters saying, ‘You have no talent and we suggest you give up writing.’ He did not have an easy time of it, and I think for anyone who wants to be a writer, it will be important for them to see how tough it was for him.” The 1,100-square-foot space will also feature the Purple Heart that Vonnegut was awarded for a wound he received as a soldier, as well as a gallery of his line art and his cigarette-stained Smith Corona typewriter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/books/20arts-VONNEGUTLIBR_BRF.html

2010-08-20,Brooklyn Museum to Extend Hours,"Beginning Oct. 6 the Brooklyn Museum, above, will keep later hours, the museum announced, staying open until 6 p.m. on Wednesdays and 10 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays. (It is now open until 5 p.m. on those days.) To offset the change, the museum will open an hour later, at 11 a.m. Weekend hours, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., will remain the same. “Clearly there’s a need for more opportunities post-5 o’clock, whether it’s families with kids getting out of school, or people coming from work, or younger people going on dates,” the museum’s director, Arnold L. Lehman, said in a phone interview. “We wanted to make a change that would better accommodate a very broad-based audience.” He said the museum would organize programs for Thursday and Friday evenings, like lectures and films. The museum will hire a few extra people in visitor services and the store to accommodate the new hours, he said, “but in both instances our hope is that our suggested admission will more than cover whatever costs we have.” The museum, which suggests that adults contribute $10, has struggled over the last decade in its attempts to increase attendance and to navigate between serving established museum audiences and attracting new audiences with populist fare. (Attendance in 2009 was 340,000, down 23 percent from the year before.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/arts/design/20arts-BROOKLYNMUSE_BRF.html

It was in the 1800s, though, that anxiety over usage really started to mount, with hundreds of grammars and polemics finding their way to print: 1829 saw “The Vulgarities of Speech Corrected: With Elegant Expressions for Provincial and Vulgar English, Scots, and Irish; for the Use of Those Who are Unacquainted With Grammar”; in 1841 there was “Decline of the English Language: The Cause and Probable Consequences”; and “A Plea for the Queen’s English” came out in 1863. For the most part these were pragmatic and steely-eyed affairs, not the kinds of books to employ excess humor or display too-great charity regarding the vicissitudes of usage.

Like its predecessor, “Freedom” is set mainly in the Midwest, and Franzen’s own Midwesternness has drawn plenty of commentary. Sam Tanenhaus, who calls the new novel “a masterpiece of American fiction” on our Aug. 29 cover, recently wrote in a blog post, “Franzen is attuned to the differences between the Eastern Seaboard’s voluptuary pleasures and indulgences, and the midland’s homelier values.” Meanwhile, Sam Anderson of New York magazine, in his rave, scored the Midwestern literary metaphor of the year, saying that some of Franzen’s sentences “are so well written you want to pluck them out, stab them with little corn holders and eat them.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/books/review/InsideList-t.html

2010-08-20,Now Online | T Women’s Fashion Fall 2010,"At T, we strive to make every issue a well-rounded one. And this season, fashion is actually on the same page, with its embrace of women who literally bust the mold. Suzy Menkes contemplates the sudden appearance of breasts on the runway. Our cover star, Freida Pinto, of “Slumdog” fame, a rare beauty with a candor to match, throws a few curve balls at Horacio Silva — and a glass of wine at the photographer Ryan McGinley. Linda Yablonsky encounters the artist Nathalie Djurberg, whose twisted, animated feats of clay celebrate bodies emaciated, voluptuous and obese; Christopher Petkanas delves into Maxime de la Falaise‘s smoldering unpublished memoirs and discovers a true lady Libertine; and Holly Brubach rediscovers the work of Caroline Blackwood, a brilliant writer whose talents are often eclipsed by her status as muse to Lucian Freud. Elsewhere, Daphne Merkin wonders if a couple of bosomy looks on the Louis Vuitton runway can conquer our much larger social fear of flesh (probably not); Ford Models revs up its engines with a more diverse lineup of faces and bodies; and the actress Laetitia Casta fills Brigitte Bardot’s shoes — and everything else.

Their jobs are about to be rendered obsolete as offset printing, with its keyboard entry and computer tape, ushers in an era of electronic publishing that will ultimately lead to the World Wide Web and beyond. “You learned the skill and now the bottom’s dropping out,” Rabbit’s boss at the plant says as he lays him off.

There is a natural ease that comes with video — it’s more spontaneous and produces more surprising results.” For her fall collection, which she says is “all about fracturing, fragmenting and re-assembling,” she teamed up with the artist Jessica Mitrani and the dancer Maria Hassabi to create a video that explores Siamese twinning with graphic, optical effects created in post-production, and also with a pair of doubled underwear.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/now-showing-vpl-in-action/

Six months after disclosing that it could no longer make payments on the $32 million it borrowed through a bond issue to finance its new building, the museum has reached a forbearance agreement with the company that insured its bonds. The agreement, which expires on June 30, means that the insurer, ACA Financial Guaranty, will cover payments to the bondholders and will not immediately exercise its rights under the financing agreement, which include foreclosing on the museum’s home. The museum’s director, Maria Ann Conelli, wrote in an e-mail that the institution considered the agreement “a positive step forward,” but that the details were confidential. ACA officials did not respond to phone messages left at their office. The bonds were issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources, a public benefit corporation created in 1980 to help cultural institutions finance capital projects. The museum, which has occupied its home on West 53rd Street since 2001, is the first organization to default on an agreement to pay off bonds that have been issued through the trust.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/arts/design/21arts-TROUBLEDFOLK_BRF.html

Ansky’s play itself has something of a shape-shifting spirit, revised many times for the stage, film, dance and even opera. In revisiting the story, the English playwright and director Julia Pascal, who has often mined Jewish themes for their universality, has framed it in the context of the Holocaust, powerfully elevating a folk tale to an existential meditation.

2010-08-23,Author Credit for Widow of Baseball Historian,"In baseball terms you might describe it as a walk-off hit deep into extra innings. Dorothy Jane Mills, below, the widow of the revered baseball historian Harold Seymour, has been belatedly recognized by Oxford University Press as co-author, along with Mr. Seymour, of three landmark scholarly works on the history of baseball, Publishers Weekly reported. Tim Bent, Oxford’s executive editor, said that Ms. Mills, 81, formerly Dorothy Z. Seymour, would be given formal credit and that her name would now accompany her late husband’s on the covers and title pages of “Baseball: The Early Years” (1960); “Baseball: The Golden Age,” (1971); and “Baseball: The People’s Game” (1991). Mr. Bent said that to his knowledge, Oxford had never before changed the authorship of a major scholarly work. In an interview with The New York Times in March, when she was recognized for the first time along with Mr. Seymour by the Society for American Baseball Research, Ms. Mills said that she had served as the primary researcher and essentially a co-author of all three books but that her husband had steadfastly refused her request that her work be credited. “All these things were done jointly,” she said. “He just couldn’t share credit. And I didn’t say anything at the time, because at the time, wives just didn’t do that.” He died in 1992, and in her 2004 autobiography, “A Woman’s Work,” she described her extensive role in the creation of the books. Ms. Mills, who is now at work on a historical novel about baseball, said that even after all these years, she still does not consider herself a fan: “You write a lot more objectively about a subject you’re not in love with.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/arts/23arts-AUTHORCREDIT_BRF.html
2010-08-23,‘The Expendables’ Tops Box Office Again,"Aging action heroes ruled the North American box office for the second weekend in a row. “The Expendables” (Lions Gate), with Sylvester Stallone leading an ensemble cast, was No. 1 with about $16.5 million, bringing the cumulative total to about $65 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing data. “Vampires Suck” (20th Century Fox), a low-budget spoof of the “Twilight” movies, was second with about $12.2 million for a five-day total of $18.6 million. “Vampires Suck,” which opened on Wednesday, appeared to narrowly beat Julia Roberts as her “Eat Pray Love” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) took third place with $12 million, earning a total of $47.1 million in North America since it opened on Aug. 13, a soft result that has renewed worries that Ms. Roberts has faded as a box-office draw. The comedy “Lottery Ticket,” from Alcon Entertainment and Warner Brothers, opened in fourth place with about $11.1 million. Fifth place appeared to be a tie, with each earning about $10.1 million: “The Other Guys” (Sony), with a new total of $88.2 million, and “Piranha 3-D,” a new horror romp from the Weinstein Company. Two other new movies fared poorly despite wide releases: “Nanny McPhee Returns” (Universal Pictures), already a hit overseas, earned $8.3 million. “The Switch” (Walt Disney Studios), a comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman, sold $8.1 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/movies/23arts-THEEXPENDABL_BRF.html

The culture minister, Farouk Hosni, announced shortly after the disappearance of the painting was made public that it had been recovered at the Cairo airport and that two Italians had been arrested in connection with theft. But Mr. Hosni said later that he had been given bad information and that the search continued. Egypt’s top prosecutor, Abdel Meguid Mahmoud, told the BBC that the museum’s security system was nothing more than a “facade.” He said museum officials had been looking for spare parts to mend the system but “hadn’t managed to find them.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/arts/design/23arts-VANGOGHPAINT_BRF.html

2010-08-25,Weekend Orchestra Seats to the Met for $25?,"It’s hard to imagine being able to see a Metropolitan Opera weekend performance from an orchestra seat for $25  particularly when the top ticket price is $420. But Agnes Varis, a Met board member, believes “opera is for everyone,” so she has decided to subsidize 13,600 seats for weekend performances for the 2010-11 season. The program extends a weekday Rush Ticket program sponsored by Ms. Varis that subsidizes 200 seats at $20 each for every weekday performance, excluding galas. “I thought a weekend program would give even more people an opportunity to enjoy the opera,” Ms. Varis said in a statement. “The Met has never been greater.” The seats in the orchestra and Grand Tier, which range from $322 to $137, will be available for $25 through weekly drawings for Friday evening, Saturday matinee and Saturday evening performances. (The premieres of new productions of “La Traviata,” on Dec. 31, and “Die Walkürie,” on April 22, are not part of the program.) Entry forms will be available only at the Met’s Web site, metopera.org. Beginning Sept. 27, every Monday through the end of the Met season in May operagoers can sign up for the drawings, which will be held on Tuesday mornings. Winners’ names will be posted by noon.

The suit argues that Mr. Norsigian and a consulting firm run by his lawyer, Arnold Peter, have “acted knowingly, willfully and with malice” in marketing the negatives as Adams’s work, according to a report in The Bay Citizen.

He was kind to other children; if a classmate cried, Kiran immediately approached. “Our little empath!” his parents proudly called him.

Disney has complained that the guild allows anyone to buy a membership (in contrast to most awards-bestowing organizations) and that Disney’s rival DreamWorks Animation has too much power because it gives its employees free guild membership. Variety, which reported the split, noted that Disney’s Pixar entries had won 6 of the last 10 top Annie prizes. But Disney started to agitate more aggressively for changes in 2009 after DreamWorks Animation’s “Kung Fu Panda” won a raft of Annies, and Pixar’s “Wall-E” won nothing. “Wall-E” went on to win the Oscar for animation that year. “We believe there is an issue with the way the Annies are judged, and have been seeking a mutually agreeable solution with the board,” Ed Catmull, president of Disney Animation and Pixar Animation, said in a statement. “Although some initial steps have been taken, the board informed us that no further changes would be made to address our concerns.” Antran Manoogian, the guild’s president, told Variety, “The Annies are about honoring the best in animation, and we will continue to do so.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/movies/26arts-DISNEYSTUDIO_BRF.html

2010-08-26,Imam Rauf and Moderate Islam,"To some extent, the controversy surrounding the Cordoba Initiative’s Lower Manhattan venture is really a controversy about how non-Muslim Westerners should relate to the would-be spokesmen for a moderate (or “moderate,” depending on your point of view) Islam. One school of thought, prominent among conservatives but associated with liberal thinkers like Paul Berman as well, holds that anything short of an absolute commitment to Enlightenment values is unacceptable from such figures, and that moderate Muslims must demonstrate this commitment, and prove their secular bona fides, by making a frontal assault on Islamic culture as it currently exists. To this school, explicitly-liberal figures like Ayaan Hirsi Ali or Irshad Manji represent the beau ideal of moderate Islam, because they’re forthright in their critiques of Muslim societies’ failings, and unstinting in their insistence that the Western way of faith and politics is ultimately superior. A high-profile bridge-builder like the ubiquitous Tariq Ramadan, on the other hand,  is much more suspect, and possibly beyond the pale — because he tends to use different language and strike different notes depending on his audience, because he often seems to be making excuses for illiberalism in the Islamic world, because he’s less-than-forthright in his condemnations of certain kinds of extremism, and so on down the line. To his critics, such bobbing and weaving is proof enough that his “moderate Islam” project is really just a flowery fraud and a Trojan Horse for Wahhabism, with no redeeming value whatsoever. And this critique is easily extended to many other self-described moderates as well — including, lately, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who arguably has a stronger claim to moderation than Ramadan, but who seems to share some of his more evasive qualities when the conversation turns to, say, Hamas or the Islamic Republic of Iran.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/imam-rauf-and-moderate-islam/

Still, governing the Empire State has become as thorny as it is thankless.

The true story urges close minding by designers of new keys and layouts. The qwerty inventor, Christopher Sholes, relied on years of study with trial users to inform his eventually successful design. Critical among his findings was that maximizing alternation of hands on successive keys greatly speeds human use. Reducing key jamming was useful, too, but could have been done in many other ways. The moral of the story is that before making changes or additions to this wonderful and globally necessary device, the results concerning human usefulness and usability need to be empirically evaluated — something easily done but much too often neglected.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29Letters-t-SHIFTPARADIG_LETTERS.html

There are huge graveyards and dusty storerooms throughout underdeveloped countries that are full of useless equipment that have missing parts or that lack reusable components. Some equipment, in particular medical-diagnostic equipment, breaks down with no means of service. The organization I work with supplies medical and surgical supplies to the Fiji and Solomon Islands. We are very realistic about bringing these countries equipment that is infrastructure-appropriate. Gift giving is a wonderful thing, but that giving must be well thought out and responsible.

Under the act, small business establishments can play audio music from radio, television, cable or satellite sources without having to pay any licensing fee, provided that certain guidelines are met. This exemption is called the home-style exemption. Generally, to qualify for the home-style exemption, the business must use a consumer-style receiver and cannot transmit the music beyond its establishment or charge admission for listening to the music.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29Letters-t-THECOPYRIGHT_LETTERS.html

Social-networking sites have gone a step ahead in expanding the notion of the self and democratizing the essence of the social consciousness. No doubt ruminations of the self and the complete attention to the joy of the moment are life’s DNA of emotional existence, but the Internet and social-networking sites can be a ladder in reaching that level of awareness for the entirety of humanity.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29Letters-t-ITWEETTHEREF_LETTERS.html

But even the most skeptical reader of his new book, “Secret Historian,” will have to admit that the bar is now set high. Samuel Steward, the subject of this absorbing act of biographical excavation, had many identities, including several that the subtitle of the book omits: pioneering sex researcher, collector of celebrity conquests, drug addict, masochist, Catholic (briefly), Navy enlistee (even more briefly), conquistador of vast provinces of America’s pre-Stonewall homosexual subculture. Most fortuitously, he was apparently a graphomaniac who documented his long, dark, exuberant, sad, dangerous life in journals, an unpublished memoir, reams of letters, poems, erotica, semifictionalized short stories and even a 746-entry card catalog of his sexual history, scrupulously maintained over five decades and in some cases ornamented — perhaps for future biographers? — with what Spring decorously calls “DNA-verifiable” evidence of his liaisons.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/books/review/Harris-t.html

2010-08-27,Does Your Language Shape How You Think?,"  Seventy years ago, in 1940, a popular science magazine published a short article that set in motion one of the trendiest intellectual fads of the 20th century. At first glance, there seemed little about the article to augur its subsequent celebrity. Neither the title, “Science and Linguistics,” nor the magazine, M.I.T.’s Technology Review, was most people’s idea of glamour. And the author, a chemical engineer who worked for an insurance company and moonlighted as an anthropology lecturer at Yale University, was an unlikely candidate for international superstardom. And yet Benjamin Lee Whorf let loose an alluring idea about language’s power over the mind, and his stirring prose seduced a whole generation into believing that our mother tongue restricts what we are able to think.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html

Willie McGee, an African-American driver of a ­grocery-delivery truck, was accused of raping a white woman, Willette Hawkins, in November 1945 in Laurel, Miss. After deliberating for less than three minutes, an all-white jury sentenced him to death, and the “small-town crime,” as Alex Heard writes, “became famous around the world.” Bella Abzug, long before she became a congress­woman, served as McGee’s defense lawyer during the appeals process, working on a case that today evokes the story line of Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Albert Einstein, Norman Mailer and Paul Robeson supported McGee, and left-wing journalists ranted about the trial in The Daily Worker. In contrast to their reports, “The Eyes of Willie McGee” does not crackle with rage, despite its horrific ending: on May 8, 1951, McGee was electrocuted in the local courthouse, leaving an odor of burned flesh in the room.

Indeed, for much of its span between New York and Boston, the Post Road is, in Eric Jaffe’s apt phrase, “a gluttonous commercial wild.” But in his valuable if uneven history, “The King’s Best Highway,” Jaffe burrows under the asphalt to reveal a thoroughfare of deeper distinction. Starting with its pastoral founding by American colonists, who exploited rocky, slippery paths that Indians had burned out of the wilderness, he tells how the road became the artery for an inchoate mail service, with loping riders carrying wax-sealed letters from tavern to tavern — the first post offices — and distributing newspapers that united the scattered colonists to revolt against the British. He traces the changes brought on by stagecoach, trolley, bicycle, reminding us that robust railroads led to the neglect of highways, until the automobile enabled the highways’ revenge.

2010-08-27,Hangover in a Strange Land,"Writing comedy about foreign travel has become more challenging in the days since Mark Twain mocked the Moors of Tangier, and even since P. J. O’Rourke wrote in his 1986 essay “Among the Euro-Weenies” that the French are “a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore.” Jokes at the expense of many nations are dicey, and Europe has a small safety zone that includes the Austrians and the French. Credit goes to David Sedaris for wringing the last possible shred of humor out of the American-in-Paris tale 10 years ago, in “Me Talk Pretty One Day.” At that point, travel writers probably should have banded together in one of those self-­regulating industry associations aimed at defusing public hostility and declared a moratorium on wisecracks about Old Europe.

2010-08-27,Her Darkest Places,"Near the end of Shirley Jackson’s most famous novel, “The Haunting of Hill House,” the heroine, a lonely young woman named Eleanor, thinks to herself, “What I want in all this world is peace, a quiet spot to lie and think, a quiet spot up among the flowers where I can dream and tell myself sweet stories.” And Eleanor does dream, but the stories, for her as for her creator, are rarely sweet. The very welcome Library of America edition of Jackson’s work, edited by Joyce Carol Oates, contains, in addition to “Hill House,” 46 of her short stories, another novel — her last, “We Have Always Lived in the Castle” — and an essay on the furious reactions to the magazine publication of her peerlessly disturbing 1948 tale “The Lottery.” Although few of the narratives collected here are as terrifying as “Hill House” or as shocking as “The Lottery” (which is about an exceptionally nasty small-town ritual), there’s precious little comfort in any of them. They’re quiet, usually, told in calm, precise, scrupulously unsensational prose, but peace of the kind for which poor Eleanor yearns is always elusive. There’s none apparent in the wide world — Jackson wrote at the height of the cold war, when anxiety was general, even fashionable. The first story in the book, “The Intoxicated,” is about a 17-year-old girl who sobers up an inebriated party­goer with a coolly imagined vision of the end of civilization: “Maybe there’ll be a law,” she speculates, “not to live in houses, so then no one can hide from anyone else, you see.” And Jackson knew too well that there’s not much peace in houses, either: no place, anywhere, to hide.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/books/review/Rafferty-t.html

2010-08-27,Frank Gehry’s Fish Lamps,"Frank Gehry designed the first of his famous fish lamps in 1983, when he was asked by the Formica Corporation for ways to use the company’s new laminate product, ColorCore, which was colored all the way through, rather than just on the surface. When Gehry was playing around with the material, he broke a piece, which looked to him like a fish scale — and the rest is design history, with the fish swimming into the collections of art world notables like Jasper Johns. On Sunday, “Fish Forms: Lamps by Frank Gehry” opens at the Jewish Museum. Organized by Ruth Beesch, the museum’s deputy director for program, the exhibition, which includes just eight lamps, was inspired by the glass fish lamp in the museum’s own collection. The lamps themselves are engaging objects, the gentle glow of the light within them contrasting with their substantial, expressionist bases. But they were never designed just for the sake of making something. The fish form was something that had fascinated Gehry for its purity and its dynamism and was well on its way to becoming a major theme in his architecture, a point that is made quite well in a video that accompanies the exhibition, which runs through Oct. 31.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/frank-gehrys-fish-lamps/

Producers of Fox’s “American Idol” said in a statement reported by The Associated Press that they do not use pitch-correcting technology to tweak the singing voices of their show’s contestants. The statement appeared to be a pre-emptive measure at a time when “The X Factor” is being assailed for misrepresenting the abilities of its contenders. Producers of “The X Factor,” which Mr. Cowell created and plans to bring to American television next year, have acknowledged that they used the pitch-correcting program Auto-Tune to correct the voices of some singers on the show, though they said it was to compensate for the different microphones used during their performances. In their statement, the “American Idol” producers wrote, “We have never, nor would we ever, use Auto-Tuning during the ‘American Idol’ competition.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/arts/television/28arts-AMERICANIDOL_BRF.html

The award covers all expenses for a three-week production at Off Off Broadway’s Flea Theater. This new “Metamorphoses,” a retelling of the Roman poet’s mythological tales from the London-based theater company Pants on Fire, will run at the Flea in TriBeCa in January. The production was adapted and directed by Peter Bramley, artistic director of Pants on Fire, with original music by Lucy Egger. Ms. Tambor, a portrait artist and long-time Edinburgh Fringe theatergoer, created the award in 2004 to bring a top work from the summertime Scottish festival to New York each year.

2010-08-30,Event About ‘Lost’ Adams Work Is Canceled,"A film about the discovery of the disputed “lost negatives” of the photographer Ansel Adams will not be shown at California State University, Fresno, as planned, the university has announced. The October screening had been arranged by Arnold Peter, an alumnus who is a lawyer for Rick Norsigian, the man who bought the negatives, one of which is above, at a garage sale 10 years ago. Mr. Peter, who is the executive producer of the film, told the university last week that he no longer wanted to show it there. He said in a statement to The Bay Citizen on Friday that the screening no longer made sense because Adams’s grandson and the managing director of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, who dispute that the 65 negatives are the work of Adams, had not agreed to take part in a discussion at the screening. The trust has filed a lawsuit to block the marketing of the negatives as Adams’s works. Experts working with Mr. Norsigian say they feel sure that Adams created the negatives. But the finding has been challenged by several parties, including the Center for Creative Photography, which Adams co-founded and which had been neutral in the debate. “We have no reason to believe that these negatives are, in fact, the work of Ansel Adams, and we support the efforts of the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust to protect its rights in this matter,” the center said in a statement on Friday.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/arts/design/28arts-EVENTABOUTLO_BRF.html
2010-08-30,Trevor Nunn To Don a New Cap at Oxford,"Having taken the summer to recover from the blistering competition for its professor of poetry chair, has Oxford University just opened the door to another heated rivalry? On Friday the university said it had named Trevor Nunn, the venerated former director of Britain’s National Theater and of productions from “Cats” to the current Broadway revival of “A Little Night Music,” as a visiting professor based at St. Catherine’s College at Oxford. The official title that Mr. Nunn will hold, however, is the Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theater, a post endowed by a fund named for that producer of theatrical hits like “Phantom of the Opera” and “Les Misérables,” among others. Students of theater (and of good ol’ slapfests) may recall that Mr. Nunn said earlier this summer that he “felt betrayed” by Mr. Mackintosh, who hired new directors for a 25th-anniversary “Les Misérables” revival being staged at the Barbican this fall; Mr. Mackintosh responded that he was “saddened by Nunn’s inaccurate and ungracious remarks.” But in his acceptance of the Oxford position Mr. Nunn was gracious, writing in a statement: “Having been invited to fulfill this role on two previous occasions, I am so pleased that this time the dates have worked out.” His yearlong appointment is to begin in October.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/theater/28arts-TREVORNUNNTO_BRF.html

About 13.5 million viewers tuned in, according to the data, up about 32,000 viewers from last year’s telecast. Those extra tens of thousands are enough to make Mr. Fallon’s Emmys the “top-scoring Emmy Awards in total viewers in four years,” NBC said  if the preliminary numbers hold, that is. The awards sank to an all-time low, 12.2 million viewers, in 2008. Among viewers ages 18 to 49, the telecast was down just one-tenth of a ratings point, to 4.1 from 4.2 last year, according to the early data.

2010-08-31,"The Met Goes to Egypt, in High Definition","The Metropolitan Opera’s high-definition cinema broadcast series is about to make another foray into the Middle East. The Met recently reached an agreement with the authorities at the Cairo Opera House to show productions there this season. The company announced the deal on Monday. Now in their fifth year, the live broadcasts will increase to 12 productions from 9 and reach 46 countries, including Spain and Portugal for the first time. The number of theaters showing the operas will rise to 1,500 from 1,200, the Met said. For a season, the program included Dubai, which stopped after the economic crisis hit, a Met spokesman said. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said he was negotiating with theaters in Israel to show the operas. A shortage of digital theaters that can receive the broadcasts has kept them out of Spain and Portugal until now, he said, and for the same reason the Met has been unable to find a foothold in Italy, the birthplace of opera. An Egyptian-born businessman, Mahmoud M. Abdallah, who sits on the Met’s board, helped broker the agreement with the National Cultural Center, which is the umbrella organization for activities at the Cairo Opera House, Mr. Gelb said. The broadcasts will be shown in a theater at the complex that seats about 350 people. The HD season begins on Oct. 9 with Wagner’s “Rheingold,” the first installment of the company’s new “Ring” cycle, directed by Robert Lepage.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/arts/music/31arts-THEMETGOESTO_BRF.html

And that’s what representatives of the O.E.D. did in a statement released on Monday after remarks by the chief executive of Oxford University Press were interpreted to mean that the venerable reference work would not be released in a paper format for its coming third edition. In an interview with The Sunday Times of London, Nigel Portwood, the chief executive, said the market for print dictionaries “is just disappearing.” When he was asked if the new edition of the O.E.D. would appear in print, Mr. Portwood replied, “I don’t think so.” On Monday, Oxford University Press responded with alacrity (“Briskness,” “promptitude,” about 1510) to say, “No decision has yet been made on the format of the third edition.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/books/31arts-PLANSFOROEDA_BRF.html

But he added, “I don’t believe negotiations have gone well.” There are difficulties, he said, over “accessibility,” because Mr. John would essentially be committing four months of his life to the Fox singing competition. Mr. Tyler and Ms. Lopez are said to be the leading candidates to replace Simon Cowell and Ellen DeGeneres. Asked on Sunday who the ""Idol"" judges would be, Mr. Lythgoe named only Randy Jackson.

Spalding & Brothers jumpsuit to keep out the cold, a wool-lined leather helmet, goggles, a white shirt and — in a nod to his home base and to the monoplane that would, 3,610 miles and some 33 hours later, make him the most famous man in the world — a blue-and-red striped tie from Vandervoort’s department store in St. Louis. The accessories were minimal, too: a pair of quart canteens, cotton wadding in his ears and a St. Christopher medal, handed to him at takeoff by a well-wisher named Katie Butler. The day after Lindbergh landed at Le Bourget airfield, he stepped out onto a balcony of the American Embassy and greeted a throng of euphoric Parisians in a hastily borrowed double-breasted suit. He’d flown with little more than the flying togs that, captured in untold miles of newsreel footage, became the indelible sartorial image associated with Lindbergh, a man Will Rogers described as a ‘‘slim, tall, bashful, smiling American boy.’’",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/sky-king/

India has tried brute military force, Indian-style democracy and pork-barrel spending. Nothing has worked. ",Multimedia/Photos,https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/pictures-285/

2010-09-01,Venice Report | Dreaming of Architecture,"Now that the three-day frenzy of the Venice Architecture Biennale opening weekend is over, and all the journalists and big-name architects have left the lagoon, it’s time to take a closer look at the exhibition and this year’s winners — and to let the general public cast their vote. The biennale committee’s decision to ask the Japanese architect (and this year’s Pritzker Prize winner) Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA to be the director of its 12th installment certainly was an interesting one. Sejima herself is the first to point out in interviews that the combination of a woman director (a first) and an Asian director (also a first) must have felt particularly right for a time when people are looking for alternatives to the gold-rush mentality and its male protagonists, who dominated architecture throughout most of the Noughties. Even the mention of people in the title of the exhibition, “People Meet in Architecture,” is a first in the history of the architecture biennale. Of the exhibition, Sejima said in her own few words that it will have “multiple viewpoints rather than a single orientation. It’s a backdrop for people to relate to architecture, for architecture to relate to people and for people to relate to themselves.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/venice-report-dreaming-of-architecture/
