2005-06-01,Hiding the Data on Drug Trials,Any Americans gullible enough to believe that the drug industry can be trusted to report fully on what clinical trials it is sponsoring or what results were found must be sorely disappointed by recent developments.

A report in yesterday's Times by Alex Berenson reveals that this intransigence also extends to a voluntary industry database. It looks as if demands from researchers and the medical profession for full access to clinical trial data will continue to be frustrated.,Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/01/opinion/hiding-the-data-on-drug-trials.html

Like a snake swallowing its tail, many of the lots were also designed by decorators, a category of 20th-century collecting that has gained expensive ground at modernist galleries as decorators seek the extremes of taste through the dated audaciousness of their peers. A pair of bronze obelisks with turtles for feet and an ormolu nude, left, by Juan Pablo Molyneux and Horacio Cordero (expected to sell for $6,000 to $9,000), might be just the thing to put the edge on your corduroy sofa.

Under current law, those arrested for selling 28 grams of powder cocaine face the same five-year sentence as those selling one-half gram of crack cocaine. Critics have argued that the mandatory minimum sentences are tilted against poor and minority defendants, who are more likely to be arrested for possession of crack cocaine than for the more expensive powdered cocaine favored by wealthier drug users. Mrs. Rell agreed that the penalty should be the same for both, but she proposed legislation that would lower the threshold to 14 grams of either one.

2005-06-02,"Paid Notice: Deaths   LIEBERMAN, WILLIAM S.","LIEBERMAN--William S. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council note with sorrow the passing of our longtime friend and colleague Bill Lieberman, who began his career at MoMA in 1943 as a volunteer for Monroe Wheeler in the Department of Exhibitions and Publications. In 1945, he became assistant to Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and in 1949 he became the first curator of the Department of Prints at the time of the opening of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Print Room. Under Bill's leadership, the department expanded to become the Department of Drawings and Prints, and in 1967 he was concurrently appointed a curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. The Museum's curatorial departments were reorganized in 1971, and Bill became the founding director of the Department of Drawings. Bill organized over forty exhibitions at MoMA, including Modern Masters: Manet to Matisse, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Modigliani, Etchings by Matisse, and Art of the Twenties. He left the Museum in 1979 to become Chairman of the Twentieth Century Art Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also became an Honorary Member of MoMA's International Council that year. Bill had an eye finely attuned to quality and elegance, and his friends formed an expansive network of artists, writers, and colleagues. Collectors with whom he was close forever enhanced the Museum's collections, perhaps most notably Florene May Schoenborn and Joan and Lester Avnet. Bill will be sorely missed, but the immeasurable impact of his thirty-six years at the Museum will be apparent for generations to come.

Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art LIEBERMAN--William S. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with deep sadness the passing of William S. Lieberman, one of the most brilliant curators in the Museum's history, who leaves a stunning legacy of great modern art acquisitions. At the Met since 1979 (after an illustrious 35 years at the Museum of Modern Art), he served first as Chairman of 20th Century Art here, and later as the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Chairman of Modern Art. In that time, he mounted more than 35 exhibitions, enlarged and enhanced the modern art collection, and oversaw many gallery installations both before the opening of the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing for modern art in 1987, and over the years since. He was often called a ""collector of collectors"" because of the astonishing number of gifts and bequests to the Met that he inspired, including scores of works by the great icons of 20th-century art, among them Balthus, Braque, Giacometti, Klee, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Picasso, and Pollock. He knew many of these artists personally and, in a life intensely devoted to art, brought their work together for study and for the enjoyment of visitors to the Met for generations to come. After June 2004, as Jacques and Natasha Gelman Special Consultant for Modern Art, he continued to work each day at the Museum. By his many donors, colleagues, and friends, this erudite, witty, profoundly talented man was universally respected and will be just as universally missed. James R.

2005-06-03,The Listings: June 3 -- June 9; ANTONY GORMLEY: 'CLEARING IV',"This installation is art's latest one-room wonder. It belongs on a list with similarly dazzling, implicitly populist sensations like Lucas Samaras's ""Mirrored Room"" of 1966, Walter De Maria's ""Earth Room"" or Yayoi Kusama's ""Fireflies on Water,"" which was a hit in the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Works of this sort often present one material in mind-boggling quantity. In Mr. Gormley's case, the material is a single strand of aluminum rod approximately 1 inch square (12.7 mm.) and nearly three miles (6 km.) long. The rod has been coiled into the main gallery at Sean Kelly in Chelsea, creating a new kind of walk-in drawing in space that also resembles a messily coiled Slinky in a very tight box. Moving around in the piece can make you feel like a small child on the loose in a storybook space. Jack's fallen beanstalk; the thorny vines protecting the sleeping Sleeping Beauty and Hansel and Gretel's forest may come to mind. At the same time, the piece relates to Minimalist sculpture, to Richard Serra's torqued and spiraled plates and Fred Sandback's stretched string sculptures. ""Clearing IV,"" above, suggests that the closer Mr. Gormley gets to the abstract, the better. The artist, who won the Tate's Turner Prize in 1994, is best known for life-size cast iron or lead sculptures of male figures -- usually based on his own body -- that convey a lugubrious and conservative humanism. The new figures in this show forsake the monolithic for the cumulative. Two are made of small blocks of mild steel. Another, installed on the gallery's roof, is an open, nearly transparent network of short bars of stainless steel. A fourth, resembling an extremely buff human porcupine, is made of hundreds of thin rods of mild steel. Evoking computer renderings, these works slightly update Mr. Gormley's earlier realism. They enter the realm of Tim Hawkinson's or Tom Friedman's figures, except that they are rendered in enduring materials that Henry Moore would have approved of. (Sean Kelly Gallery, 529 West 29th Street, (212)239-1181, through June 25; free.)

2005-06-03,Open Roads: New Italian Cinema,"Paolo Sorrentino's film ""The Consequences of Love"" is set mostly in a Swiss luxury hotel where its poker-faced, 50-year-old protagonist and narrator, Tita (Tony Servillo), an accountant for the Mafia, has lived for years. The eeriest scenes of the film, which won five David di Donatello Awards (including best film, best director and best actor), show Tita supervising a room filled with workers grimly counting untold millions of dollars by hand. Why not do it electronically, one asks? Tita says he prefers the human touch. He is a kind of super gambler held virtual prisoner there because of a costly mistake he made years earlier. In the film, he makes one last life-and-death bluff for a woman. What makes ""The Consequences of Love"" (with Adriano Giannini, above left, and Olivia Magnani) more than a cerebral thriller is the metaphysical weight of Tita's self-knowledge. In a world where money rules more than ever, he is an existential fatalist for the 21st century. ""Consequences,"" which has two screenings today at the Walter Reade Theater, is one of the deeper films in ""Open Roads: The New Italian Cinema,"" the Film Society of Lincoln Center's annual Italian film series, which continues through Thursday. It shares with many of this year's films a visual fascination with the outer limits of modernity. That fascination links it to such Italian films of the 1960's as Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Eclipse."" In Renato De Maria's ""Love Me,"" Isabella Ferrari plays a beautiful 35-year-old woman, married at 15, who explores her own sexual power after her husband of 20 years leaves her. As she drifts through a world of elegant nightclubs and hotels in one close encounter after another, she suggests a reversal of the alienated neurotic beauty once played by Monica Vitti; she blooms. ""Love Me"" has screenings tomorrow and Wednesday. (Walter Reade, (212)875-5600.) STEPHEN HOLDEN",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/movies/open-roads-new-italian-cinema.html

2005-06-03,"Arts, Briefly; Court Battle Exposes Wildenstein Art to Auction","A French court has directed that part of one of the world's largest private inventories of art be liquidated within weeks to settle an inheritance battle that has split the Wildenstein family. Unless the sons of the art dealer Daniel Wildenstein, Alec and Guy, reach a settlement with Daniel's widow, Sylvia Wildenstein, a significant collection of paintings and drawings will be sold at auction in early July, Mrs. Wildenstein said in an interview. The family's real estate holdings in New York and Paris and a string of thoroughbred racehorses and breeding stock are also under court order to be sold and the proceeds divided among the heirs. Under French inheritance law, Mrs. Wildenstein would get at least 50 percent of the proceeds. In its four generations of art dealing, the Wildenstein family has amassed works by old masters and Impressionists including Renoir, van Gogh, Cézanne, and many others. The family has rarely disclosed details of its holdings, but court documents made public during divorce proceedings of Alec Wildenstein in 1999 estimated the value of its collection at as much as $10 billion. Daniel Wildenstein died in Paris in 2001 at 84. According to the decision by the Cour d'Appel in Paris, his sons persuaded Mrs. Wildenstein, now 71, to sign away her inheritance in the days after his death by telling her that she would face huge tax bills and a possible criminal investigation. But according to the court decision, Wildenstein had made provisions for any tax liability.

According to the League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade group, the box office gross for the season was $768.6 million, just short of last year's record $770.9 million. (The Broadway season runs from one year's June Tony Awards to the next.) Paid attendance for the 2004-5 season also dropped slightly, to 11.5 million, the fourth-highest figure on record. But after a fall that brought only three new musicals, none successful, the season's final quarter yielded better sales, with $222.1 million in gross receipts over the last 13 weeks. And in an encouraging sign for producers, both domestic and international tourism continued to recover from the effects of the 2001 terrorist attacks; out-of-town visitors made up 60 percent of the Broadway audience.

The annual McDonald's Gospelfest is a showcase for established gospel stars -- including, this year, current R&B-influenced singers like Donnie McClurkin and Vickie Winans -- as well as a steppingstone for winners of gospel talent competitions. But the headliner for this year's Gospelfest is a singer who grew far more famous outside the church: Aretha Franklin, above. A preacher's daughter who packed gospel dynamics into her 1960's soul classics, Ms. Franklin grows both fervent and flamboyant on the rare occasions when she drops her secular repertory and returns to gospel songs. There will be plenty of impressive voices onstage, and Ms. Franklin, a fiercely competitive singer when she chooses to be, just may sing rings around all of them.

Under current law, those arrested for selling 28 grams of powder cocaine face the same five-year sentence as those selling one-half gram of crack cocaine. Critics have argued that the mandatory minimum sentences are tilted against poor and minority defendants, who are more likely to be arrested for possession of crack cocaine than for the more expensive powdered cocaine favored by wealthier drug users.

An all-repeat slate of ""Cold Case"" (in the 8 p.m. ""Survivor"" slot), ""CSI"" and ""Without a Trace"" drew an average of 11.85 million on Thursday night. Also predictable was the status of ""CSI"" as the most-watched program of the evening, with an audience of 13.86 million. But NBC, a distant second in total viewers, managed to tie CBS among 18-to-49-year-olds, thanks to the premiere of another summer reality series, ""Hit Me Baby One More Time."" That show, in which one-hit wonders compete in front of an audience, drew 8.65 million viewers opposite ""CSI"" but bested it in the 18-to-49 age group. ""Without a Trace"" was the only CBS offering to win that demographic on Thursday, but its ratings were strong enough to ensure the tie with NBC.

2005-06-06,"Arts, Briefly; WCBS-FM Trades In Golden Oldies for Beastie Boys","WCBS-FM (101.1), the New York radio station that for three decades has served as a purveyor of frozen-in-time golden oldies, jumped on radio's latest trend yesterday, dumping its genre for the ""Jack format,"" which runs off a broader list of mainstream hits from the 1970's through the 90's. At 5 p.m. yesterday, the station largely abandoned acts like Tom Jones, the Four Tops and the Supremes in favor of the Beastie Boys, No Doubt, Tom Petty and Duran Duran. Analysts say the change by WCBS's corporate parent, Infinity Broadcasting, reflects demographic shifts and a gradual redefinition of what constitutes oldies for today's radio listeners. The Jack format, devised by a Canadian company, Rogers Media, is playing on a growing number of stations in the United States. Programmers have been adopting the format, which is built from a bigger-than-usual music library and results in odd mixes of songs from various eras and genres, partly as a response to the popularity of iPods and satellite radio, which offer deep playlists with no commercials. WCBS had been playing the oldies format since 1972. Infinity said its program director, Dave Logan, and its morning host, Micky Dolenz, above, of the 1960's made-for-television band the Monkees, had left the station. The company said the oldies format continues at www.wcbsfm.com. Infinity's Chicago oldies station, WJMK-FM, is also changing to the Jack format.

The notorious tea tax, which had so inflamed the people of Massachusetts, was only one-fourth of what the English paid at home; even Benjamin Franklin labeled the Boston Tea Party an act of piracy.

2005-06-06,Nonfiction Chronicle,"EARLY BIRD. By Rodney Rothman. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) Here's hoping that Rothman has overcome his nasty fabrication habit, because if the stories and people in his new book, ""Early Bird,"" are real, he has produced a warm, wry bit of reportage. Rothman earned some ignominy in 2000 when an article he wrote for The New Yorker turned out to have fictions mixed in with its facts, causing the magazine to run an apology. That article involved his posing as an employee at a dot-com company, and in ""Early Bird"" Rodman poses again, in a way: he retires to Florida, in his late 20's, moving into a Century Village senior citizens' complex. Rothman manages to be both an observer of these strange beings about three times his age and a sad-sack newcomer trying to blend in with them. He is working a bit of a stereotype, but his descriptions of the loneliness, the cliquishness, the slow-motion desperation of the place ring true and bittersweet. Most surprising is that his tales contain not an ounce of mean-spiritedness -- this from someone who once wrote for David Letterman. ""Young people often think old people all look the same,"" he writes in a passage typical of his tone, ""but that misconception works both ways. To elderly people, young people merge into one tender pink blob. Elderly people always seem to think I am 18 or 19, which is flattering until I remember that their eyesight is failing and that a certain percentage of them suffer from dementia.""

Takeover bids typically provide a nice boost to investors' portfolios and confirm their stock-picking smarts.

It's an entertainingly gruesome book, and Palahniuk (it is pronounced POL-a-nick) has come up with some entertainingly gruesome ways to promote it. His well-choreographed readings will not remind you of Cynthia Ozick's. At bookstore appearances, Palahniuk likes to read a section of ""Haunted"" about people who are boiled to death in natural hot springs -- but not before he has handed out teriyaki-scented air fresheners that make the local Barnes & Noble smell like the world's nastiest steakhouse. After that, he said in a telephone interview, ""I bring the energy level back up by lobbing fake bloody, severed appendages into the crowd."" (The fake-appendage plan went awry on his last tour when some of his bookstore visits nearly overlapped with those by Aron Ralston, the climber who wrote a memoir about how he amputated his own arm after it was pinned by a boulder. ""He had a real sense of humor about it,"" Palahniuk said. ""He said he wants them for his paperback tour."") Palahniuk ends his events by handing out, to those who ask him questions, rugs that resemble pieces of meat. His best-known novel is, of course, ""Fight Club."" There are always a few people who hang around after his readings to ask him how to find a fight club, or to invite him to the ones they've started. ""I always say, 'No, thank you,' "" Palahniuk said.

Palmer was a loving and dedicated husband to Polly, his wife of 42 years; to his children Chip, Dave and Jeff; to his daughters-in-law Sheila, Sarah and Cindy, and his grandchildren Palmer, Regan, Matthew, Charlie, Clay, J.P., Lucas, James and Sam. Palmer would certainly describe his family as the crowning achievement in what was a very rich life. Palmer worked as a commercial real estate broker for over 30 years, as a result of his successes as a promotional broker the Uris Buildings Corporation asked the Cross and Brown Company to name he and his partner David Hoffman as rental agents for 300 and 320 Park Ave. Over the years he would serve in that capacity for many buildings, including 3,90, 200, 300, 320 and 410 on Park Ave. alone. Many of the Fortune 500 companies found their headquarters offices through his efforts, the likes of which included National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and International Paper. Palmer was Executive Vice President and served on the Board of Directors for the Cross & Brown Company. Later in his career, he was also a founding member of Sealy, Hoffman & Sheehan, Inc. Palmer graduated from the Millbrook School in 1954, and Brown University in 1958, where he received his BA in history, beginning what would be a lifetime passion for US history. He toured Civil War battle sites with friends, and explored the genealogy which dated back to Walter Palmer, settler of Stonington, CT, in 1652. Following Brown, Palmer served his country as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps for two years. Palmer also pursued a lifelong passion for tennis, something passed to him from his father Palmer Sealy Sr., a USTA doubles finalist. He ran the West Side Tennis Club Junior Program during the 1960's introducing many young, promising players to the game, most notably Vitas Gerulaitis, who later went on to win the Australian Open. A memorial service will he held 11 AM, on Saturday, June 11, 2005, at the Brookville Reformed Church, Brookville, NY. Further information, Whitting Funeral Home, 300 Glen Cove Ave., Glen Head, NY.

2005-06-06,Fiction Chronicle,"NATURAL NOVEL. By Georgi Gospodinov. Translated by Zornitsa Hristova. (Dalkey Archive, paper, $12.50.) Gospodinov flits and buzzes among various subjects -- from graffiti in public toilets to the movies of Quentin Tarantino -- in this tale of a young Bulgarian writer who decides to create his own version of a ""natural novel"" assembled from the bits and pieces of everyday life. At its center is a poignant story about the narrator's divorce and the fact that he isn't ""the author"" of his soon-to-be-ex-wife's pregnancy. Maybe he's suffering from attention deficit disorder; maybe he's just stuck with a skewed if stoic appreciation of life's messy flux. Whatever the cause, his monologue turns into a quirky, compulsively readable book that deftly hints at the emptiness and sadness at its core.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

2005-06-06,A Car That Flies on Autopilot,"When ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" makes the perilous leap from 1980's television series to 21st-century feature film later this summer, fans of the TV show's spectacular car jumps (accompanied by the sweet strains of ""Dixie"" played on a car horn) won't be disappointed. But the film's three biggest jumps were executed without anyone at the wheel -- an increasingly common way to save money on ambitious stunts. For the climactic scene shown here, in which Bo Duke (Seann William Scott) rockets over a police barricade to arrive at the courthouse in time to save the day, the special-effects team used a technique known as ratchet launching to hurl the car, known as the General Lee, some 170 feet.

An airport manager and a police officer rushed to the burning wreck and pulled out the pilot, who was the only person aboard, aviation officials said. The pilot was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center. The pilot warned the control tower that he was having mechanical problems about a minute before the crash, said Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates the busy airport. Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said that the pilot reported trouble with both engines and that controllers cleared him to land right away.

2005-06-06,The Real European Union,"The Eurovision Song Contest, that venerable multinational forerunner of ""American Idol,"" wrapped up its 50th edition recently, awarding the top prize to Helena Paparizou of Greece and the song ""My Number One."" (Ms. Paparizou is seen at right in the finale in Kiev, Ukraine, demonstrating skills we haven't seen from Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Studdard.) Both contests involve mass balloting by television viewers and intense debates about voting patterns. But in Eurovision, those patterns are a lot more complicated: this year's contest involved voters from 39 countries, representing multiple languages, cultures and historical animosities. Those relationships drew the attention of Neil F. Johnson, a professor of physics at Oxford University, who, in ""How Does Europe Make Its Mind Up?,"" set out to quantify how geopolitics factors in with lyrics, voice and smile. The paper (online at http://arxiv.org/PS--cache/physics/pdf/0505/0505071.pdf) was written with three other Oxford scholars. ""Like so many other systems,"" Mr. Johnson said, ""Eurovision is an economy where things are exchanging information over time."" Among his findings, based on voting from 1992 to 2003: (1) While many voting affinities were geographically predictable, some were surprising. For instance: Scandinavian and Estonian voters tended to favor the same songs. Looking deeper, Mr. Johnson found that Estonia's large Finnish population was probably the reason. (2) While Britain is often branded the most Europhobic of European nations, its voters were the most ""in tune"" with the continent; they gave more points to new Central European countries than voters from other older nations, and they began voting for eventual winners earlier and in greater numbers. (3) France, on the other hand, was ""the most out of tune"" in its voting; French viewers consistently failed to vote for the countries that were most likely to vote for France. All of this, of course, has wounded various European sensibilities. ""You wouldn't believe my e-mail box,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""I open it in fear every morning.""",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/arts/music/the-real-european-union.html

May I submit ""receipts"" that accurately reflect my expenses but that I have simply forged? M.E., New York The quirky use of quotation marks in a query (""receipts"") is a surprisingly reliable clue to misconduct. While your ends are legitimate -- you're entitled to the reimbursement -- your means are not. Rather than engage in counterfeiting, you should obtain honest documents.

Insurgents are invariably at a disadvantage in terms of troops and firepower. They survive only if they have superior information, which they derive from broad popular support. This support -- whether voluntary or coerced -- allows them to hit, run and hide; to kill and survive to kill again.

Born Aaron Nadler in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 11, 1924, to Samuel Nadler (from Bucharest, Romania ) and Clara Rubin (from Iasi, Romania), he came to the United States in 1955. An accomplished graphic artist, his first enterprise was a marketing and publicity firm, Arch Nadler Associates. He then established with Rober Larimer the New York advertising agency, Nadler and Larimer, Inc. It soon established itself as one of the major and innovative firms in the world, with additional offices in London, Paris and Bremen. Its clients included Faberge, Austin Nichols, Lionel Toys, New York State Lottery, and Conde Nast. He was the Chairman of the Board until his retirement in 1983. He married Sarah Shirley Friedmanin 1949, and their daughter Linden (now living in Jerusalem, Israel), was born in 1950. After a divorce, he married Nancy Sharon Hertz in 1957. They had three children: Steven (of Madison, WI); Lauren (of Wilton, CT); and David (of LLoyd Harbor, NY). He also had nine grandchildren: Rose and Ben Nadler (Madison); Cameron Nadler (Wilton); Caroline, Sydney and Savannah Nadler (Lloyd Harbor) and Eliezar Zev, Ariel and Rachel Stromberg (Jerusalem). He is also survived by his brother, Sidney Nadler. He was a loving and deeply beloved husband and father, and a devoted, generous, and doting grandfather. He was blessed with wisdom, a brilliantly dry sense of humor, quiet digity, and (something he tried to impart to his children) an unfailing sense of ""menschlicheit"". He never forgot his impoverished roots--he lost his father when he was 14, and worked to support his family--and his personal and professional success never clouded his sense of who he was and where he came from. May his memory be for a blessing. With love, from his children",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/classified/paid-notice-deaths-nadler-arch.html

The man, William M. Gulley, 51, was convicted of killing an 81-year-old woman and raping her 61-year-old daughter in 1994. The court ruled on Monday that Mr. Gulley's trial lawyers did not take ""fairly obvious"" measures to find witnesses or medical reports that said he saved a man from electrocution and a woman from jumping out of a window in 1992, though they had seen a newspaper article about the acts.

Which it will be with China, I don't know. India, by contrast, is like a highway full of potholes, with no sidewalks and half the streetlamps broken.

The purple, red and orange panels that dot the garden are made by sandwiching a thin layer of colored plastic film between two layers of glass.

Mr. Klein said the idea of Mr. Costas's pinch-hitting for Mr. King was first broached by someone at HBO. Mr. Costas does an occasional interview program, ""Costas Now,"" for HBO, which like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. Mr. Costas, 53, said he welcomed the opportunity to do ""long-form"" interviews and was grateful that Mr. King thought the arrangement was ""a good idea."" Mr. Costas, who continues to work for NBC Sports, said he did not expect his moonlighting for CNN to conflict with his duties covering events like the Winter Olympics next year in Turin, Italy.

At the $2 million mark, Mr. Mindel looked behind him with astonishment to see who was besting his bids. ""Wonderful,"" Ms. Grajales said of her feeling in winning. ""It's one of the greatest pieces."" Experts said they had not expected the table to realize more than $500,000.

2005-06-10,The Listings: June 10 -- June 16; PASCAL RIOULT,"He kept the original Stravinsky score but otherwise radically re-envisioned ""The Firebird"" last year. Mr. Rioult, a former Martha Graham principal and now a modern-dance choreographer in his own right, shifted the setting of the exotic ballet classic from a Russian fairytale forest to a grimly empty modern-day world. The magical bird of the original, who saves two courtly young lovers from monsters, became an innocent young girl who attempts to humanize the lost men and women around her. Now Mr. Rioult is at it again, in dances to be performed at the Joyce Theater starting onTuesday. This time he has taken on ""Les Noces"" (above), a 1914 classic in which the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska evoked a bride's intense fears as she prepares for her wedding. Once again, Mr. Rioult has kept the ballet's Stravinsky score. But his ""Noces"" explores the anxieties of both women and men as they become equal partners in sexual discovery. Also on the program is a restaging of an earlier Rioult work that took a new look at a classic. ""Kansas City Orfeo,"" a work in progress set to the Gluck opera score and Kansas City jazz, moves Orfeo and Eurydice from the underworld to Kansas City clubs during Prohibition, all recalled by a disillusioned older Orfeo. The Juilliard Jazz Ensemble will perform. Mr. Rioult's ""Firebird"" completes the program. (The Pascal Rioult Dance Theater performs Tuesday through next Sunday at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or joyce.org. Tickets: $38.)

In one neatly made colored pencil drawing the first three block letters of the word ""blurred"" are rendered in blue, the last three in red and the ""r"" in the middle in purple. It is a finely distilled comment on the inane red-state-blue-state formulation. A painted mural, above, is more puzzling. It takes a while to figure out that the letters P N U U M L D E -- alternately painted black and gray and diminishing in height toward the middle -- resolve into the word ""pendulum"" when you read back and forth one letter at a time from outside to inside.

The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on June 6, maintains that Mr. Seagal consistently failed to arrive on the set on time, rewrote scenes on a ""locked"" script and made early, unapproved set departures. On the final day of shooting ""Today You Die,"" it says, the actor left the set five hours early to attend a dinner he described as having ""national security implications"" and as a result, three scenes scheduled for that day could not be completed. Marty Singer, Mr. Seagal's litigation lawyer, said in a telephone interview Wednesday: ""This lawsuit is absolutely frivolous, was filed in bad faith and it was only filed by Nu Image as an excuse to try to stop paying monies that are legitimately owed to Mr. Seagal. Evidence of the bad faith is, as of yesterday, they offered to pay $650,000 out of the $830,000 that is currently owed to Mr. Seagal, and they filed the lawsuit as a preemptive strike, knowing that my client was going to file a lawsuit against them concerning his many claims.""

2005-06-10,"Paid Notice: Deaths   DOHERTY, SEAN","DOHERTY--Sean of NYC died suddenly at NYU Medical Center on Monday (June 6, 2005). Sean was the loving husband of Meg, the beloved brother of Una, Patrick, Teddy, Noel, Mari Byron and the late Kathleen O'Brien, and the dear uncle of many nieces and nephews. Born in Ireland, Sean has lived in NYC for the past 38 years. Sean attended a Jesuit seminary in Ireland and served as Jesuit missionary in Peru and Bolivia. Sean was the Chief Executive Officer of TML Information Services, Inc. and the Chairman of the Board for the North American Driver Safety Foundation. Sean's passion for driver safety and protecting individual's privacy rights was exemplified in his innovative and creative work using official Department of Motor Vehicle driver records of the various states of the US and several foreign jurisdictions in Mexico and Canada for promoting highway safety both in law enforcement and in the rental and insurance industries. Sean's pioneer work in this field created a large source of revenue for many jurisdictions. Sean was active as an Associate Member of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and a member of AAMVA's Industry Advisory Board. Sean was also a leader in the Insurance Industry Committee for Motor Vehicle Affairs and a member of the Board of the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety. Sean provided his international leadership skills to the US Department of Transporation for implementing a technology transfer that developed commercial driver and motor carrier safety initiatives and a safety information system infrastructure between the US and Mexico. As part of his contributions with the US Department of Transportation on safety data exchange between the US and Mexico, Sean served in the Transportation Consultative Group of the NAFTA Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee. Sean made significant contributions to the US Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration's Team/Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's working group facilitating the opening of the USMexico borders for commercial motor vehicle operators. Sean was a leader in promoting safe driving and was coauthor of the CDL Effectiveness Study for the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Services Administration, a Report to Congress that was instrumental in the implementation of updated federal regulations embodied in the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act. Sean will be remembered for his brilliant and creative mind, vast depth of knowledge in history, government, mathematics and the technical fields related to computers and information transfers, insatiable curiosity, inquiring mind, generous heart, love for his fellow man, and dedication to his friends, his business partners, and employees, all of whom Sean regarded as his family. Sean loved life which he faced with a sense of adventure and a zest for the joys this world brings; it was said of him that he lived life as a poet would like to record it, with intensity and uncompromising dedication. For Sean there was no other way. Sean's sense of humor and ""twinkle in his eyes"" will be with us always. Sean will be missed, but what wonderful memories and shared adventures he leaves for his family and friends to remember and cherish. A funeral service will be at Gannon Funeral Home on Friday at 9:00 AM followed by a burial service at The Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, NY. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The American Diabetes Association, PO Box 1131, Fairfax, VA 22038-1131.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/classified/paid-notice-deaths-doherty-sean.html

2005-06-10,"Paid Notice: Deaths   PIRANI, CONRAD L., M.D.","PIRANI--Conrad L., M.D. The Department of Pathology of Columbia University notes with sadness the passing of Conrad Levi Pirani, M.D., an internationally recognized expert in diseases of the kidney, who died of heart failure at age 90 on May 28 in Pittsfield, Mass. Dr. Pirani, who founded Columbia's Renal Pathology Laboratory in 1973, was one of the most influential pathologists of his day. His work forged the transition from autopsy-based studies of the kidney to modern biopsybased pathologic interpretation. The semiquantitative method he developed for evaluating needle biopsies of the kidney is not only essential to establish an accurate diagnosis, but also provides valuable clinical information about disease activity and reversibility that has helped guide optimal therapy. His systematic approach has been instrumental in describing for the first time the defining features of many major renal diseases. Dr. Pirani was born in Pisa, Italy, and attended medical school in Italy. Because of racial laws enacted by the Mussolini government, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. His early career in pathology was at the University of Illinois, and he was appointed chairman of pathology at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in 1965. In 1973, he came to Columbia University Medical Center as professor of pathology and director of the newly created Renal Pathology Laboratory. He retired from that position in 1985, becoming professor emeritus of pathology. Dr. Pirani lectured widely and published more than 200 research papers and textbook chapters over a 30year period. He is best known for his seminal observations on the clinical-pathologic features of lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and myeloma-related renal disease, which helped form the basis of our modern understanding. In 1977, he founded the course ""Renal Biopsy in Medical Diseases of the Kidney,"" which is the longest-running continuing medical education course in the history of Columbia University Medical Center. Lectures in his name are given every year at Columbia and at the Mario Negri Institute for Renal Research in Bergamo, Italy.

2005-06-10,'Au Hasard Balthazar',"Forget the Sith, Tom and Katie, the big movie news this summer is the release on DVD on Tuesday of one of the greatest films in history: ""Au Hasard Balthazar."" Written and directed by Robert Bresson, and shot in limpid black-and-white, this 1966 allegory tracks the journey of two innocents, the teenage Marie (Anna Wiazemsky, above, who later married Jean-Luc Godard) and the soulful donkey of the film's title that's adopted by her family when she and the animal are very young. In the course of Bresson's short tale, both Marie and Balthazar will endure a crucible of suffering -- she at the rough hands of a punk in a black leather jacket, the donkey at the equally rough hands of various vicious masters. The critic J. Hoberman has observed that ""Balthazar"" is about a donkey in about the same way that ""Moby-Dick"" is about a whale, but it is also true that this is a story about an animal. Inspired by a passage from Dostoevsky's ""Idiot,"" Bresson makes Balthazar the moral center of his film, perhaps because, unlike Marie and the rest of the men and women in this fallen world, the donkey doesn't need to die to achieve grace. (It's worth noting that Bresson used a Schubert Sonata as ""a kind of language for the donkey's soul."") Over the years, some critics have classified Bresson's work as unapproachable, even punishing. For these professional philistines the idea that movies can be serious, more than tricks and trashy entertainment, is apparently anathema. Don't you believe it: ""Au Hasard Balthazar"" is a masterpiece of the art, but a masterpiece that stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind. Released by the Criterion Collection, the DVD features a pristine print with a new translation and includes a 1966 television program about the film.

2005-06-10,The Listings: June 10 -- June 16; LCD SOUNDSYSTEM,"If you visit lcdsoundsystem.com, you can watch the video for ""Disco Infiltrator,"" the unreasonably propulsive new single from the disco-punk band LCD Soundsystem, above. It's a performance video, although the performance itself unfolds for only a few seconds, in a scene that occurs more than halfway through. The rest of the time, you're watching the band members as they go about their day: they wake up, run errands, stumble down to the venue and then, inevitably, find their way to the after-party. The group's leader is the singer and producer James Murphy (one-half of the team known as DFA), who is credited with ""most sounds"" on the band's self-titled debut album, released by Capitol Records. By releasing a series of great underground singles (included with the album on a bonus disc), LCD Soundsystem became known as one of the city's most entertaining dance-music acts, and fans were no doubt hoping for an album that included a few more DJ-friendly tracks. That's exactly what the CD provides -- no more but also, more important, no less. Mr. Murphy loves to rifle through the record racks, paying tribute to his favorite finds by dropping names (the first track is called, ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House,"" after the French house duo) and borrowing beats; among other things, the album is a tribute to the diversity of early-1980's new wave. ""Disco Infiltrator"" is the moment where everything snaps into place: there's a keyed-up backbeat and a one-note bass line, and Mr. Murphy yelps -- then, near the end, croons -- the lyrics; the only thing wrong is that, at five minutes long, the track is over too soon. Expect an ecstatic version (and, perhaps, a longer one) during a pair of appearances this week. (Tonight at 6:30, with the Juan Maclean, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)533-2111, $20.

The play, based on women's stories about the role of their vaginas in their lives and encompassing topics that range from childbirth to rape, is especially difficult to render in Russian: translators often lament that the language for sex is limited to clinical terms or expletives. Vasily Arkanov, the United States correspondent for NTV, a Russian television network, said he was inspired to translate the play after he wrote an article about it for the Russian version of Elle magazine. He told The Moscow Times that for the Russian title he ultimately chose to transliterate the English word ""vagina"" rather than use the standard Russian equivalent, which he concluded was too vulgar. Joel Lehtonen, the play's director, told The Moscow Times that he had had problems securing financing and finding actresses comfortable enough to speak their explicit lines.

2005-06-13,World Briefing | Asia: India: Opposition Leader Staying On,"Three days after tendering his resignation as chief of the largest opposition party and prompting a crisis of leadership within its ranks, L.K. Advani withdrew his bid to step down. Mr. Advani, left, the chief architect of the Hindu nationalists' rise to power, sparked a war of words within his Bharatiya Janata Party after praising the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, as a ""secular"" leader during a trip to Karachi last week. Mr. Jinnah has been demonized by India's Hindu nationalists as the man responsible for the partition of the country. Yesterday, party apparatchiks praised Mr. Advani's trip to Pakistan but did not back his comments on Mr. Jinnah. It signaled a compromise between loyalists of Mr. Advani, who has increasingly sought to cast himself as a moderate, and the Hindu hard-liners within the party.

2005-06-13,Interrogating Ourselves,"I. The Silence After Abu Ghraib In order to get to the nub of the question of what we as citizens really expect and require of American interrogators facing supposed terrorists -- how far we're prepared to allow those asking the questions to venture into the dark realm of brutalization and coercion -- let's for argument's sake put aside the most horrific, shameful cases, those of detainees who died under interrogation: that of Manadel al-Jamadi, for instance, whose body was wrapped in plastic and packed in ice when it was carried out of an Abu Ghraib prison shower room a year and a half ago, where he'd been handcuffed to a wall; or Abed Hamed Mowhoush, who, elsewhere in Iraq, appears to have been thrust headfirst into a sleeping bag, manhandled there and then, finally, suffocated. By anyone's definition of torture -- even that of the Bush administration, which originally propounded (and later withdrew) a strikingly narrow definition holding that torture occurs only when the pain is ""of an intensity akin to that which accompanies serious physical injury such as death or organ failure"" -- these cases answer the question of whether torture has been committed by our side in what's called the global war on terror. No one steps forward to condone what's plainly illegal under United States and international law. And although we've seen no indication that blame will attach to any official or command officer at any level for these killings, there are small signs that conclusions have been drawn somewhere between the Pentagon and White House, signs of an overdue housecleaning, or maybe just a tidying up. By the coldest cost-benefit calculation, a dead detainee is a disaster: he cannot be a source of ""actionable intelligence,"" only fury. So there's now a new policy, ""Procedures for Investigations Into the Death of Detainees in the Custody of the Armed Forces of the U.S.,"" that was duly conveyed last month to the Committee Against Torture, a United Nations body, in a subsection of a longer report. The subsection's heading even carried a whiff of contrition. It was ""Lessons Learned and Policy Reforms."" Also, the Pentagon has let it be known that it's preparing a new manual for interrogators that prohibits physical and psychological humiliation of detainees. What interrogation techniques it does allow are listed in a classified annex as, presumably, are any hints of what can happen when those techniques fail to produce the desired results. Can the detainee then be handed over to another agency, like the Central Intelligence Agency, that may not be constrained by the new directives? Or to units of a foreign government like the counterterrorism units now being financed and coordinated in Iraq by the United States?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/magazine/interrogating-ourselves.html

A couple of years ago, she was thrilled to came across the etiquette book the formidable Millicent Fenwick wrote for Vogue in 1948.

The 6-foot-1 mannequin of Mr. Hussein, depicted as he looked at the time of his capture in December 2003, is the focal point of the first of four Operation Iraqi Freedom exhibits the museum has planned to document the division's deployment to Iraq. It went on display two weeks ago and is free to the public, though its main purpose is to educate soldiers. Dressed in brown sandals (""I think we got those from Wal-Mart,"" Ms. Stratton said) and dark blue shalwar kameez (traditional trousers and tunic), the latex rendering of Mr. Hussein -- bound in plastic handcuffs donated by a local policeman -- took seven months to fabricate. It stands in a glass case next to a date palm tree; directly in front of it, on a floor of sand littered with bricks and rocks, is the actual metal box that held the $750,000, in American $100 bills, that Mr. Hussein had in his possession; to his left is a makeshift prayer rug representing the entrance to the spider hole.

After winning international renown for discovering how genes encoded by adenovirus caused disease, Marshall, in characteristic fashion, converted those disease-causing genes into therapeutic tools to cure diabetes mellitus. Marshall was tirelessly and enthusiastically devoted to mentoring and nurturing the careers of generations of students, pediatric residents, fellows, scientists and faculty members. Marshall will be keenly missed, but his impact as an exemplary role model and his countless contributions to our Department, our Medical School, and the world of Medicine, will endure for generations to come.

2005-06-13,Inside the List,"DATING GAMES: When a serious writer has a serious new book to sell, he or she tends to drop it on bookstores in the spring or the fall -- the ""prestige"" seasons, when it's cool enough outside to plausibly wear tweeds at readings. The historian David McCullough cuts against this grain. He likes to publish his books around Memorial Day, just in time for beach readers, and it's a strategy that's been good to him. His new book, ""1776,"" makes its debut on the nonfiction list this week at No. 1. His last book, ""John Adams,"" released in late May of 2001, also entered the list at No. 1, and lingered on the hardcover chart for 60 weeks. McCullough's biography of Harry Truman, published in June of 1992, rose only as high as No. 2, but it too had a long, lazy run on the hardcover list -- 43 weeks. McCullough is not what you would call a trendy writer, but the title ""1776"" does seem to confirm a new vogue for narratives that trace the arc of one specific, earth-rattling year. Already this spring we've had Winston Groom's ""1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls,"" as well as Jonathan Mahler's ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning,"" a look at New York City in the bumptious year of 1977. This August will bring Charles Mann's ""1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus."" And some readers may still be trying to wade their way through ""1421: The Year China Discovered America"" (2003) and ""1215: The Year of Magna Carta"" (2004).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The most famous recantation in history was that made by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, when threatened by the Inquisition in 1633 with dire punishment for advocating the theory of Copernicus that the earth was not the center of the universe but that it moved around the sun: ""I abjure, curse and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies,"" swore the intimidated scientist, legendarily adding under his breath, ""eppur si muove"" -- ""but it moves.""

You can also see it in her personal history and opinions. Born in England, raised in poverty in Australia by a mother who is half-Russian and half-Ugandan, Mowbray-d'Arbela, 38, has never smoked. In her view, no one should. And those who do should quit. Those who have failed to quit should try again. She does not take issue with the World Health Organization's projection that 500 million people now alive will eventually die from smoking-related diseases; when I first met her for breakfast late last winter in Manhattan, she actually pointed me to that very statistic. She then made an impassioned presentation about the toxins in tobacco, a display so granularly detailed and footnoted and cross-indexed that when she began to talk about the 4,000 or so chemicals (including some 60 known carcinogens) released by every burning cigarette, a tally now agreed upon by virtually all tobacco scientists, I feared she might list every one.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/magazine/incendiary-device.html

2005-06-13,Try Convincing a Child These Are Real Penguins,"Children today, reared on a steady diet of lifelike computer-generated imagery, know their animation. It's real life that may trip them up, if reports from screenings of the documentary ""The March of the Penguins"" are any indication. The film, which opens in New York on June 24, follows emperor penguins on their winter mating journey. The French filmmaker Luc Jacquet and his camera crew spent 13 months following the penguins as they traveled hundreds of miles, single file and in very short steps, into the frosty depths of Antarctica. There, after a courtship involving an intricate ritual dance, the flightless birds pair off. Apparently it's not the bizarre penguin watusi that has the ""Madagascar"" demographic scratching their heads, but rather shots of the birds waddling in unison in the intensely colorful, foreign environment of the ice shelf and swimming in the ocean. Angie Argabrite, from Clifton, N.J., took her children to a screening and was surprised to learn that all three thought the film had been at least partly animated. Her 10-year-old son, Eli, asked, ""'If they wanted to make the film so real, why did they use special effects when the penguins were underwater?""' Jackson Buchanan, 6, of New Rochelle, N.Y., said, ""Sometimes at the beginning I thought it was animated, but then I figured it out.""",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/movies/MoviesFeatures/try-convincing-a-child-these-are-real-penguins.html

Hayder's wrenching third novel was originally published in Britain last year as ""Tokyo"" -- a less memorable but more appropriate title for a beautifully controlled thriller about culture clash and especially about a strain of cruelty running through Japanese history. Grey, a young woman from England with some morbid ideas about her sexuality, has been obsessed for years with a particular atrocity committed by Japanese soldiers during the Nanking massacre in 1937. She comes to Tokyo in 1990 to find an elderly Chinese professor who has the only copy of a film depicting it; he agrees to help her if she'll ferret out the secret of a life-prolonging elixir from a yakuza gangster in a wheelchair. (The professor, naturally, is one of the massacre's survivors, and his diary from those days alternates chapters with Grey's narration.) Working at a Marilyn Monroe-themed ""hostess club"" called Some Like It Hot, Grey flirts with businessmen, overcomes her terror of sex with the help of an American co-worker and tries to figure out how to get past the gangster's terrifying bodyguard, a gigantic, murderous woman called ""the Nurse.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

But the biggest casualty at the box office this weekend might have been ""Cinderella Man"" (Universal), the boxing drama starring Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger.

The Rossville section of Staten Island also experienced failures, said Joe Petta, a spokesman for the utility. The most serious loss of power occurred last night when a fire in a manhole cut power to 12 buildings in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan.

The cause of the fire was still under investigation. About 5:30 p.m., power to some 2,100 customers was cut in Rossville in southeastern Staten Island. By 10 p.m., power had been restored to all but 90 customers, Mr. Petta said, adding that he did not know the cause of the failure. In the Bronx, a fire in a manhole on the Grand Concourse at East 167th Street cut power to one block along the street, said Firefighter Charlie Markey, a spokesman for the Fire Department.

2005-06-15,"Paid Notice: Deaths   COONEY, JOHN M.","COONEY--John M. John Mason Cooney succumbed to cancer on June 13, 2005. He was 71 years old. This brought to a close a life devoted to education and community service, including 30 years of distinguished service at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Cooney was born in 1933 and raised in McDowell County, West Virginia, where his father and grandfather were involved in the coal industry. Graduating from Elkhorn High School as class president, he continued his education in 1952 at the McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one of the nation's top college preparatory schools. Cooney obtained his bachelor's degree from Marshall University in 1956, studying philosophy and Greek. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary from 1956-1958 and transferred to Harvard University, where he received his divinity degree (theology) in 1959. In 1962, he completed credits for his doctoral degree in political science at Rutgers University. Cooney's early professional years were spent in the church. He served as minister of the Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Califon, New Jersey, from 1959-1966. He was a member of Newton Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church (honorably retired). Cooney was the organizing chairman of the Northwest New Jersey Community Action Program, the antipoverty agency still serving Hunterdon, Warren, and Sussex counties. He then worked for New Jersey Governors Hughes and Cahill in the Department of Community Affairs, in the areas of education and youth. Among his many duties, he served Governor Cahill as staff director for the White House Conference on Children and Youth (1969-1972), assembling and directing the New Jersey committee that included, among others, future New Jersey Governor and 9/ 11 Commission Chair Thomas Kean. In 1972, Cooney began work representing Rutgers University in the local community and as a liaison to the state government, local government and community organizations, and coordinating visits of national and world dignitaries while serving Rutgers University President Edward J. Bloustein. He continued to serve in that role under Bloustein's successor, Francis L. Lawrence. Cooney retired from that position in 2002.

Meanwhile, the board of PBS voted to adopt an updated set of journalistic standards to govern programming and content development, in large part to make the policies, last revised in 1987, more reflective of media other than television. The moves come at one of the more politicized moments in the history of public broadcasting. Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, a Republican who is chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funnels about $400 million in federal money to public television and radio, has pushed to change what he and other conservatives say is the liberal bias of some public programming, particularly on PBS. Last week, a House Appropriations panel approved a spending bill that would cut the corporation's budget by about a quarter. And the corporation announced early in April that it was naming two ombudsmen of its own, even though National Public Radio already had one and PBS was expected to add one of its own soon.

The Department of Pathology of NYU School of Medicine mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Zoltan Ovary, M.D., Professor of Pathology, who died June 12, 2005, after 47 years of service on the faculty. One of the founders and early leaders in the field of immunology, he was internationally recognized for his discoveries and break through methods in the study of allergy, the control of the immune response, and the quantification of antibodies. Dr. Ovary was a consummate man of the 20th Century, his rich life spanning 98 years. Born in Kolozsvar, Transylvania, then part of Hungary, he lived in several countries in Western Europe before coming to the United States as a Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. In 1959 he accepted a position at NYU, where he educated and inspired countless students and colleagues. Convinced that life, science, and art are inseparable, he initiated the NYU School of Medicine Artist-inResidence program, which ran from 1965 to 1976. He was instrumental in putting the Aston Magna Foundation for Music and the Humanities on the cultural map, and at NYU he belonged to a nucleus of renowned immunologists-including Nobel laureate Baruj Benacerraf, Lewis Thomas, and Edward C. Franklin--who were devoted to the arts. He worked in his office until eight days before his death, sharing his passion for science and art. Dr. Ovary exuded an infectious zest for life; he was an extraordinary raconteur with a quick wit capable of reducing his listeners to tears of laughter. Even during recent periods of ill health, he displayed an ability to accept life at whatever cost, finding joy at museums and concerts and in communication with his devoted friends, both nearby and around the world. A memorial service at NYU is being planned. David B.

2005-06-15,"World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Fewer Cars, but More Profits","Canadian auto production will probably stagnate this year, the Conference Board of Canada predicted. Weak demand in the United States, which is the main market for Canadian-made automobiles and auto parts, and a relatively high Canadian dollar will lead to three consecutive quarters of declining production, the report said. The study predicted that by the end of the year the auto sector would increase production by only 0.1 percent. The report was not all bad news, however. The Conference Board, which is based in Ottawa, expects that auto industry profits in Canada would rise sharply because of declining costs for labor and materials. The Conference Board forecast profits of 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.9 billion) in 2005 compared with 1.4 billion last year.

The Bush administration, which proposed reducing subsidies to zero, praised the action, but Amtrak said the cut would force it to shut down all operations, because it could not meet debt service, pay its obligations to the railroad retirement fund and make required payments to the workers it would have to lay off.

In addition to tours of the European music capitals, Ms. Zaremba appeared with most of the major symphony orchestras in this country, working with renowned conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski. Ms. Zaremba was trained at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and she was an acclaimed teacher herself, serving for a number of years as the chairman of the keyboard department at the Ohio State University School of Music.

2005-06-17,The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; VIJAY IYER,"He appeared about 10 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area, a very young jazz pianist bursting with micro- and macro- and meta-theories. He wanted to unite jazz and funk, Indian drone elements and swing; he also seemed to want to synthesize four pianists, related but still diverse: Duke Ellington, Andrew Hill, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor. (There were urgent political themes, too, addressed in liner notes.) His music was usually based in odd meters and played hard and dry; it could be daunting. He wasn't working in a vacuum, though, and kept sanding down his sound. Some of his most important early colleagues, like the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa and the guitarist Liberty Ellman, ended up in New York around the same time that he did, in 1998; then the circle expanded again, bringing in the drummer Derrek Phillips and the bassist Stephan Crump. Now Mr. Iyer, above, leads a quartet that includes Mr. Mahanthappa, Mr. Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, who is only 19 but has the potential to become one of the bulldozing presences in New York jazz. The band's most recent album, ""Reimagining"" (Savoy Jazz), is its best, and Mr. Iyer's gigs are attaining a newly urgent momentum, with some genuine lyricism offsetting the rhythm attack. He's a jazz musician of the moment, and now's the time to hear him. (Tuesday through Thursday at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; sets are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., and the cover charge is $20.)

A native of Chicopee, Massachusetts, Sylvia Zaremba was a valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 61 years. A child prodigy, Ms. Zaremba gave her first public performance at age five. She debuted with the Cleveland Orchestra under Artur Rodzinski at age ten, and gave her New York recital debut at Town Hall in the same year. In addition to tours of the European music capitals, Ms. Zaremba appeared with most of the major symphony orchestras in this country, working with renowned conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski.

2005-06-17,The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; MARY ANN CURRIER,"A glance at the illustrated brochure announcing Mary Ann Currier's exhibition could lead you to mistake her for an obscure 19th-century still-life painter. In fact, Ms. Currier, 78, lives in Louisville, Ky., and is known for still-life paintings and oil pastels that give traditional Chardin-like realism a distinctly contemporary resonance. This fall, the Speed Art Museum in Louisville will present a 30-year survey of her career (Oct. 4-Dec. 18). The recent paintings in her current show depict one, two or three dying roses larger than life on 24-inch-wide sheets of paper (above). It is an almost impossibly clichéd subject, but Ms. Currier revives it, painting with a satiny, soft-edged touch and an intense, nonphotographic attention to texture, light and detail that gives the deep red or peach-colored blossoms a strange, almost fleshy palpability. Lying on otherwise empty surfaces and still connected to dried and faded stems and leaves, the roses are extravagantly florid and even erotically sensuous. While Romantic and Freudian overtones reverberate, the paintings also evoke the antique tradition of the vanitas -- the still-life that allegorizes the futility of material attachments in a world where no one escapes death.

2005-06-17,"Paid Notice: Deaths   LINDSAY, JAMES K., ESQ.","LINDSAY--James K., Esq. 85, retired NYC attorney and life long advocate for the disadvantaged died in Amherst, MA on May 30, 2005. He was the son of Sadie Gombrich (the French actress Claudine LeDuc) and Robert Kenneth Lindsay, a salesman, and was born in Winnipeg, Alberta. In spite of an itinerant childhood, and the early loss of his father, Mr. Lindsay distinguished himself academically at a very young age and graduated first in his class from Ridley College in St. Catherines, Ontario at the age of 14. He graduated from Oberlin College at the age of 18, and from the University of Michigan Law School at the age of 21 where he served on the Law Review. Mr. Lindsay married Priscilla Shepherd, a fellow alumna of Oberlin College, in 1942, and raised a family with her. Early in his corporate law career he worked for Republic Aircraft, Hayden Chemical Corp., and the Manhattan law firm of Fulton, Duncan, and Halley. He became vice president of Tenneco, Inc. He then established his own law practice. Mr. Lindsay fought actively for social justice in many arenas. He served on the board of directors of the New York City Mission Society for 12 years and was its president for six years. He was an advocate for low-income housing and served on the Fair Housing Commission of Briarcliff, NY. He was an active Episcopalian who taught Sunday school and served on the vestry of All Saint's Church, Briarcliff, NY. He was an avid crossword puzzle fan, who was famous in his family for completing the daily NY Times puzzle on his commuter train as it traveled nonstop between 125th St and Grand Central Station. After the death of Priscilla in 1972 he married Shirley Blois Brown, a musician and teacher who was embraced by his family. Mr. Lindsay retired to Savannah, Georgia where he initiated a volunteer program at Georgia Legal Services and was a moving force coordinating legal services, domestic violence advocates, and the police in the establishment of a Safe Shelter for battered and abused women and their children. Mr. Lindsay was honored by a 'Jim Lindsay Day' there for his efforts in 2002 when the shelter opened its new facility. After suffering several strokes he moved to Jacksonville, FL where he lived until his wife died in 2004. He is survived by his brother Dennis J. Lindsay, Esq, of Portland, OR; three children from his first marriage: Rev. Susan Tobias of Lower Cabot, VT; R. Kenneth Lindsay of Amherst, MA; Dr. Pippi Ellison of Newton, MA; six grandchildren, one greatgrandchild, and eight nephews and nieces. Contributions in his name may be made to the endowment fund for Safe Shelter at The Savannah Community Foundation, 7393 Hodgson Memorial, suite 204, Savannah, GA. 31406.

Intimations of mortality bring out something special in a great talent who has no intention of going quietly. Special may be good, bad or indifferent, but these efforts invariably take us deeper into an artist's psyche and sharpen, sometimes poignantly, our understanding of his gift. We get privileged glimpses of regrets, hard-earned wisdom and eruptions of primal feelings. One way or another, late works are by definition fascinating.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/arts/design/the-photographers-eye-transformed-by-his-hands.html
2005-06-17,The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; TOM WOPAT,"We have seen Tom Wopat swagger, mosey, stride and strut, but in the revival of ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" he tries something new. As the mealy-mouthed mark James Lingk, who is torn between the sweet-talking sales pitch of Richard Roma and the orders of his wife, Mr. Wopat shuffles across the stage, self-consciously staring at his feet. You would never know that this unassuming middle-aged actor once played the easygoing heartthrob Luke Duke in the hit television series ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Mr. Wopat is one of the great surprises of this acclaimed production, proving with only a few lines, none of which, by the way, include curse words, that he will not be typecast. After ""Hazzard"" finished its run in the mid-80's, he continued playing robust and ruggedly macho characters in the sitcom ""Cybil"" and in musicals like ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""42nd Street."" Mr. Wopat (above left,with Liev Schreiber) uses his history playing confident leading men to his advantage in ""Glengarry,"" fleshing out how his character's weakness makes him such an easy person to manipulate. What comes through so vividly is that what Lingk really wants is to walk with a swagger just like Tom Wopat always did. (Bernard B.

The two men were arrested on June 7 and are being held without bail. In an affidavit, the F.B.I. said the younger Mr. Hayat had trained in Pakistan to kill Americans and that his father had helped to pay for the training. Lawyers for the men denied the accusations. As the grand jury met, several Muslim leaders and civil rights advocates raised concerns about the way the F.B.I., which is engaged in a broader terrorism investigation in Lodi, had questioned Muslims there.

The competing dancers, from 17 to 24 years old, do not know what choreography they will perform until they arrive in New York, where they learn the dances together in rehearsals at the new Ailey center just south of Lincoln Center. The nine-member international jury includes Dame Merle Park, former principal with the Royal Ballet, and Alexei Ratmansky, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet. (Information: www.nyibc.org.

And perhaps even more because he has given two generations of musicians a place to play, first operating a small venue called the Birdhouse, and then a legendary South Side bar, the Velvet Lounge.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/18/arts/music/the-sax-man-cometh-to-swing-in-new-york.html

The officer, Sasa Svejtan, was given the maximum sentence for the shootings, which happened at the beginning with Serbia's conflict with NATO in the province. Dejan Demirovic, another member of the unit, known as the Scorpions, was also accused along with Mr. Svejtan. He is in prison in Canada and is fighting extradition to Serbia. The trial was seen as test of Serbia's ability to try war crimes when it began last year, and the court found Mr. Svejtan guilty. But that verdict was overturned this year by Serbia's Supreme Court over procedural irregularities. The court reconfirmed the original verdict on Friday before sentencing Mr. Svejtan.

The research is being conducted because the Food and Drug Administration sent the company a so-called approvable letter in October saying that it needed more data about Arcoxia's safety and effectiveness before clearing the drug for sale, Merck said. Arcoxia is part of the group of painkillers that came under fire from government officials and consumer groups after Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., withdrew Vioxx because of its link to heart attacks and strokes. One Merck study includes 23,500 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and compares the cardiovascular safety of Arcoxia with the drug diclofenac. A second smaller study compares stomach side effects in Arcoxia against diclofenac in about 4,000 rheumatoid arthritis patients.

By his studiously self-deprecating account, he was a decent athlete, a below-average student, and -- after joining the Army's fabled 10th Mountain Division in World War II -- a mediocre lieutenant. It is only after he is horrifically wounded on the Italian front that we begin to get a hint of the strength that helped Dole ascend almost to the pinnacle of American politics, or a flash of his bone-dry wit. (""The mere thought of being back on American soil sent electricity through me,"" he writes of his time in a hospital bed encased in plaster. ""At least, I think it did."") It took more than a year of agonizing physical therapy before Dole could even stand again, and months of operations to allow him to so much as hold a pen in his battered right hand. But the moments of intimacy -- as when Dole confesses that to this day he cannot bear to look himself in the mirror, save to shave or comb his hair -- are rare.

Patrick Filbin, Bloomfield Hills, Mich. It's a fine thing to play with your kids but a dubious thing to lie to them. One way to distinguish between playing and lying is that play occurs with the understanding and consent of all involved. This is a simple enough matter to work out when it involves adult fantasy, from novels to movies to more personal play: consent can be explicit. With kids, it's trickier, a problem every parent grapples with when deciding how to answer a child who asks if there really is a Santa Claus or if the coin under the pillow really comes from the Tooth Fairy. Is the child eager to continue a kind of game, or is he or she requesting honest, if game-ending, information? Such a question requires intimate knowledge of a particular child's thinking, development and desires. To answer it requires all the insight and understanding a parent can muster.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/magazine/deceiving-the-kids.html

2005-06-20,Movement,"Clive Gillinson transformed himself from musician into manager at a moment of crisis. In 1984, the London Symphony Orchestra was more than $600,000 in debt and sinking. The orchestra moved two years earlier into the Barbican Center, a mazelike modern-arts complex located in the City, the financial district, which in those days shut down after dark. In that confusing and out-of-the-way destination, the orchestra administration programmed unorthodox concerts (a festival of Berlioz and Michael Tippett, for example) in tightly clustered stretches. Each Barbican concert lost an average of $3,000. An orchestra that is governed by its players, the L.S.O. reacted to this desperate plight with an act of desperation. It forced out its managing director and, looking within the ranks, recruited Gillinson, a young cellist whose chief business credential was running an antiques shop with his wife in his spare time. Before accepting, the prudent cellist insisted that his chair in the orchestra be kept open for a year in case the new job didn't work out.

Derivatives help in two ways. They help managers to know the value -- and potential changes in value -- of those risk positions, and they make it easier to shed the risks they don't want and take on those they do. Not every decision will be profitable, and some companies will fail, just as they did before the growth of derivatives.

In the late 1950's, when the young Louis Malle was beginning his filmmaking career, his restless, searching temperament served him well at first: at 23 he was a co-director (with Jacques-Yves Cousteau) of an undersea documentary, ""Silent World"" (1956), which won an Oscar and the Palme d'Or at Cannes; two years later, his first dramatic features -- a tricky thriller called ""Elevator to the Gallows"" and an unabashedly romantic tale of provincial adultery called ""The Lovers"" -- were among the earliest and biggest commercial successes of his generation of French filmmakers, soon to be known as the New Wave. But his curiosity quickly got the better of him: after that promising start, he promptly set about his true life's work, which was to look at the world around him as hard as he could, and to keep his creative identity from becoming too solid, too well defined. ""You see the world much better through the camera,"" he once said, and he wouldn't let anything, even his own personality, block the view.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/movies/in-every-film-a-different-louis-malle.html

2005-06-20,THE WEEK AHEAD: June 19-25; CLASSICAL MUSIC,"Talk about going against the flow. Starting a new concert series in summer, on Monday nights, with doors opening at 6 p.m., in a cabaret/restaurant setting, seems so delightfully to contradict conventional wisdom about programming that it merits attention for its contrarian nature alone. But the ONE-TWO-THREE-GO! series appears to be worth a look for the more substantial -- and traditional -- reason that it presents interesting artists doing interesting things. This Monday's concert features EVE BEGLARIAN and COREY DARGEL, two noted downtown composer-performers, and the flutist MARGARET LANCASTER in a program billed as ""electro-cabaret,"" which features, in part, Ms. Beglarian and Mr. Dargel performing each other's songs. (It turns out this series isn't, strictly speaking, new; but since its previous incarnation was during the regular 2001-2 season, this is a rebirth of sorts.)

2005-06-20,Inside the List,"LAW REVIEW: Lisa Scottoline writes tangy legal thrillers that are set in Philadelphia, her hometown, and she is often called ""the female Grisham."" The comparison is apt enough, though Scottoline's jokey and brittle entertainments make Grisham's books, with their laconic detachment, read like Graham Greene. Scottoline -- ""rhymes with fettuccine,"" she has said -- has published 12 novels, beginning with ""Everywhere That Mary Went"" (1994). Until now, they have mostly been about the often imperiled employees at an all-female law firm called Rosato & Associates. Her new novel, ""Devil's Corner,"" is a departure of sorts. The book, which enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 9, introduces a frisky new heroine -- a prosecutor named Vicki Allegretti. Commercially speaking, it was probably time to give Rosato & Associates a rest. While each of Scottoline's previous five novels made the Times list in hardcover, her last one, ""Killer Smile,"" was her poorest showing in years -- the book entered the list at No. 14 and vanished two weeks later. A former litigator, Scottoline goes to extreme lengths to make sure she gets the details right. According to her Web site, she has, alarmingly, ""driven up the front steps of the Art Museum in Philadelphia (the famous Rocky stairs) just to make sure it could be done."" Some writers of thrillers like to cultivate a certain air of bristling aloofness. Not Scottoline. ""She wants to meet her readers one on one,"" a note on her Web site says, and ""give them all great big bear hugs.""",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The interior designer Colum McCartan eschews flashy trappings for a focus on natural comforts: muted, soothing blue, green, and cream tones, hallways lit by translucent leaf-patterned glass panels, and sprigs of eucalyptus and lavender bringing the outdoors in. Among Vitale's serene, California-style offerings are free yoga classes daily, kayaking weekends on the bay, and custom bath treatments on the roof. One highlight: outdoor terraces on the fifth and eighth floors, each with sweeping views of the San Francisco waterfront and the nearby Bay Bridge, enabling all guests (not just those with water-view rooms) to take in the city's beauty. The eight-floor brick building also houses Americano, a restaurant and bar serving locally influenced nouveau Italian dishes.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/travel/hotel-vitale-in-san-francisco.html

The votes by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee came just 10 days before the Legislature is required, by law, to produce a balanced budget. But the Senate and the Assembly, though both controlled by Democrats, do not agree on how much the rebates should total and whether any new taxes should be imposed.

The lawyer, Alexander Bunin, said that he was trying to spare his client the death penalty and that it was up to the federal government to prove that the client, Donald Fell, should be executed. Mr. Fell, 25, is accused of kidnapping a Rutland woman in 2001, driving to New York and bludgeoning her to death in Dutchess County. Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Fell and an accomplice kidnapped the woman, Terry King, as a way to flee Vermont after they killed his mother and a friend of hers.

2005-06-21,Depressed Domestic Fares,"DEPRESSED DOMESTIC FARES -- Despite small, incremental fare increases imposed half a dozen times so far this year by major domestic carriers, the average domestic one-way air fare paid during the first quarter of 2005 was $202, which is 13 percent lower than the $234 average in the period last year, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. The survey, which reflects fares paid by clients of American Express Business Travel, a corporate travel management company, encompasses first-class, unrestricted coach and discount coach tickets. American Express said that fares were depressed because of continuing competitive rate cuts on many routes, as well as aggressive corporate negotiating on fares. The recent rounds of fare increases appear to be having an effect, though. In April, the average domestic one-way fare was $210, up $8 from the first-quarter average, American Express said. By comparison, for all of 2000, the average domestic one-way fare was $259. International fares are going up, meanwhile. On 160 monitored routes, the average fare rose 4 percent in the first quarter of 2005, largely reflecting strong demand for business-class and first-class travel.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/business/depressed-domestic-fares.html

In another communiqué, the rebels said they had declared the alert to complete a reorganization of their forces and announced that they were preparing to consult with their bases on the future course of the movement.

2005-06-22,National Briefing | Midwest: Illinois: Segregation And Racial Inequality,"Segregation and inequality between blacks and whites in areas like housing, education, income and employment are persistent problems in Chicago, according to a study by the city's chapter of the Urban League. The study found that 13 of the city's 15 richest neighborhoods were disproportionately white, while 12 of the city's 15 poorest neighborhoods were disproportionately black. The study also found that the city's 22 predominantly black neighborhoods had an unemployment rate almost twice that of the city as a whole. Also, from 1970 to 2000, the median family income in Chicago rose by 2 percent for blacks, compared with 19 percent for whites and 16 percent for Latinos.

The Backstreet Boys' ""Never Gone"" (Jive) reached No. 3, selling 290,000 copies; that might sound like a lot, but comparing it with its last album, ""Black & Blue"" -- which sold 1.6 million copies in its first week of release, in November 2000 -- is a sobering reminder that the boy-band era is past its peak. Down the chart, Fat Joe's ""All or Nothing"" (Atlantic) opened at No. 6 with 106,000 sales. Meanwhile, Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill Acoustic"" (Maverick/Warner Brothers) sold more than 61,000 copies at Starbucks stores, according to that company, which has the exclusive right to sell the album for its first six weeks. But Billboard said it would be ineligible for the magazine's main album chart until its release to other retailers on July 26.

2005-06-24,'Paramount Before the Code',"This year, Film Forum is devoting its annual extended summer retrospective to one of the great hoards of relatively unseen American films: those frequently astonishing, often impressive and always interesting features produced by Paramount Pictures between the coming of sound and the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934. Now owned by Universal, as are most of the pre-1949 Paramount films, these titles have gone largely unexplored since their television exposure in the 1970's, and there are many that have not been seen at all since their original release. Now, thanks to Bob O'Neil, Universal's vice president for film preservation, many pre-code Paramount films are returning to the scene, most in 35-mm prints. Among the 46 programs that Film Forum will be screening from today through July 21 are a handful of famous titles, such as the double bill of Ernst Lubitsch's ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932) and Josef von Sternberg's ""Blonde Venus"" (above with Marlene Dietrich and Sidney Toler), which opens the series today and tomorrow. Paramount's most celebrated directors, Lubitsch and Sternberg prospered in the freedom that reigned before the censorship crackdown, Lubitsch to create his sensual and suggestive comedies, Sternberg to spin his shadowy erotic fantasies starring Dietrich. While the studio's image was closely associated with Sternberg and Lubitsch's continental sophistication, Paramount also turned out quite a few of the gritty urban melodramas usually associated with Warner Brothers, and this fine series, programmed by Bruce Goldstein, gives pride of place to some surprising rediscoveries from this neglected side of the studio's output. Sylvia Sidney, Paramount's Bronx-accented answer to the innocent ingénues played by Janet Gaynor at Fox, stars in a double bill on July 5 and 6 of ""Ladies of the Big House"" (1931) and ""Pick-Up"" (1933), two gruff, working-class dramas directed by Marion Gering, and even Sternberg made his contribution to the genre by casting Sidney in his 1931 adaptation of ""An American Tragedy"" (July 9), one of his most underrated films. Paramount's confectionary, cosmopolitan side is also much on display, as in the double feature of July 1, Frank Tuttle's droll romantic comedy, ""This Is the Night"" (1932), and Harlan Thompson's musical ode to plastic surgery (really!), ""Kiss and Make-Up"" (1934), both featuring a young Cary Grant.

2005-06-24,"Arts, Briefly; Not Bad for Starters","For most first-time novelists, just making it onto the best-seller lists is a thrill. Elizabeth Kostova has done one better. Her debut novel, ""The Historian,"" was ranked No. 1 on The New York Times's fiction hardcover best-seller list in its first week on sale. (The list, which reflects sales for the weekend ended June 18, will be published in the newspaper on July 3 and will be available online next week at nytimes.com/books.) ""The Historian"" received a huge publicity push from its publisher, Little, Brown & Company, a division of the Time Warner Book Group. Before publication, Little, Brown said that it planned to spend $500,000 promoting the book; it paid a $2 million advance in June 2004 for rights to it. Booksellers have been discounting the book heavily, which also probably helped sales; last weekend Borders Stores was selling the book at 40 percent off the $25.95 cover price, a bigger-than-normal discount for new titles.

It also includes calls for voluntary reductions in emissions that scientists blame for global climate changes and subsidies for new technology to decrease pollution. The House version includes far more tax breaks for traditional fossil fuels and electric utilities as well as $2 billion to support deep-water drilling for oil.

The Palestinian leadership says more than 500 militants in other cities have already signed up to work in the security forces or take civilian jobs in government. The deal in Nablus, a hotbed for militants, is the most comprehensive agreement so far. Most of those joining are from Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, linked to the Fatah movement led by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president. The campaign is part of Mr. Abbas's effort to persuade militants to halt attacks against Israel. They are supposed to turn in their weapons as well, though compliance has been spotty, Palestinian officials say. Israeli troops have pulled back from two West Bank towns, and Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has proposed turning over security to the Palestinians in two more towns.

2005-06-24,MAVERICK CONCERTS,"When these concerts began back in 1916, summer chamber music in a rural American setting was indeed a more maverick idea. Hervey White founded the series, named it after the arts colony he had established on his farm near Woodstock, N.Y., and built a large barn (above) that served as a concert hall. That barn still stands, and so does at least some of the adventurous spirit in concerts that bridge chamber music favorites with newer or more unusual works. This weekend, Maverick opens its 90th anniversary season with two such programs: tomorrow night, the Contrasts Quartet juxtaposes Beethoven and Schubert with works by Aaron Jay Kernis and Peter Schickele; Sunday, the violinist Charles Libove and the pianist Nina Lugovoy offer a recital of Saint-Saens and Mozart offset by Henry Cowell, Robert Starer and others. Running through Sept. 4, the season features both established ensembles like the Tokyo Quartet (Aug. 14) and younger groups on the rise, like the Miró (July 16) and Pacifica (July 24) Quartets. Alexander Platt, in his third summer as music director, has also woven through the schedule a five-concert tribute to his predecessor, the flutist Georges Barrère, and his fruitful relationship to the early-20th-century American composer Charles Tomlinson Griffes. (Tomorrow night at 6 and Sunday at 3 p.m., the Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845)679-8217, $20, $5 for students, free for children under 12 with an adult.)

It's not exactly a surprise that one of the greatest actors of our time was also a joker. We might have guessed that from some of his bizarre public appearances, like the television interview, from his bloated and nonsensical later years, in which he kissed Larry King on the mouth.

Ahmsa's vice chairman, Xavier Autrey, was arrested on the tax charges in July in Spain and has been under house arrest there. Ahmsa's chairman, Alonso Ancira, also wanted on tax charges, is thought to be in Israel, which has no extradition treaty with Mexico. The company said the two are now free to return to Mexico. Mr. Ancira and Mr. Autrey own 73 percent of the company. In April, with high world steel prices raising earnings, the company restarted debt negotiations. The Finance Ministry had no comment on why the charges, involving $2 million in payroll taxes, had been dropped, citing tax secrecy laws. Ahmsa is based in Monclova, in northern Mexico.

2005-06-24,ARTHUR SIMMS,"Some homeless people contrive the illusion of owning property by bundling found and mostly useless material into great aggregates that they load onto shopping carts or other wheeled vehicles. The sculptures of Arthur Simms, a Brooklyn resident who represented his homeland of Jamaica in the 2001 Venice Biennale, call to mind this sort of roving, often mentally eccentric pack rat. The earlier pieces in his show of works dating from 1989 to the present consist of quantities of junk -- rags, old shoes, milk crates, tools, plumbing parts and so on -- wrapped in dense cocoons of rope. These massive, bulging constructions, some standing on wheels, exude an uncanny power in proportion to the urban poverty that they evoke. In recent works, like ""Blue Chair"" or ""Carnival"" (above), the found constituents are more discernible: the frames of a blue metal chair and an old wooden one wrapped in a delicate net of copper wire in the one instance; the gold-foil wrapped skateboard, the clear bottle, the wooden shoe form and the bird cage all pulled together by twine webbing and looking a bit like a small dog in the second case. The tradition of the Surrealist assemblage lies behind these works, but they are not so self-congratulatingly witty as such objects can be; Mr. Simms's works are sophisticatedly absurd, but there is a touching pathos about them, too. His is a tender reclamation project; he is a saver of lost souls. (Five Myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718)783-4438, through July 10.)

The new operating system scheduled to be released in the second half of 2006, will integrate tools for Really Simple Syndication throughout its operating system, allowing users to use and update content from the Web seamlessly in their e-mail messages, word processing, spreadsheet and calendar. Really Simple Syndication has been available for several years as a way to subscribe to feeds from Web sites, but its use has only recently grown. About 5 percent of Internet users obtain information using the system, a Pew Internet and American Life Project report found in January. It is different from e-mail messages because it involves retrieving information selectively from specified Web sites or Web logs. When consumers view their feeds using the system, they typically see the updated Web content all on one screen.

To mark the 100 years since Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity in Bern, the city has declared 2005 ""Einstein Year,"" and images of him are plastered on everything from shop windows to streetcars. The Historisches Museum Bern, (1) Helvetiaplatz 5, (41-31) 350 77 11, www.bhm.ch, recently opened an exhibition that traces Einstein's life and explains his theories through interactive displays.

The fashion designer, known for his creative exuberance, has had a field day with fabric, furniture, wallpaper, paint, accessories - and that's just the lobby. The lavishly Lacroixian touches continue throughout the 17th-century building. Each of the 17 guest rooms has a different look. Walls might be covered in haute-couture sketches, starry skies or giant carnations. Furniture ranges from antique to pop to zen, sometimes in the same room. It's lodging as theater.

Monson opens with a chart, closes with an index and pocks the intervening text with radio wiring diagrams as he merges metaliterary form with a grim subject (kids falling to their deaths through the ice of a frozen lake) in a poetic, startling, even funny collection of linked stories. As bored locals run laps inside the wintry cage of Upper Michigan and his occasional narrator mourns an ex-flame who went into the water on prom night, Monson turns this lost corner of America into the setting for a unique brand of mudroom Gothic. There's a diver reciting the procedures for recovering the dead, a cop reminding himself of the right way to notify the next of kin, and a catalog of the temperatures at which different items freeze. The funniest list identifies the things a woman must do to lessen her chances of being murdered: ""Do not go on dates with men. Do not go on dates with men who drive. . . . Do not spend time with any kind of men at all."" The drumbeat of particular words -- snowmobile, sauna, Superior, meth -- roots the reader in a very specific place, and Monson is its loving curator. Sometimes glimpses of a whole new world break through the ice, making you wish for a longer, linear, uninterrupted visit.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html

He has always, he added, ""read a lot of books and gone to a lot of movies"" and never considered one form superior to the other -- just as he's always been fond of both popular and literary fiction. This may explain why, over the course of his career, he has worked as an editor of mysteries, westerns, horror novels and science fiction, and has written about popular music, dance, poetry and theater for publications like The Atlantic Monthly, The Threepenny Review and Savvy. At The Times, his appearances have been equally various: notes on Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign for the Op-Ed page, an article for The Times Magazine on DVD's and Arts & Leisure essays on James Dean, World War I and Federico Fellini. At the Book Review, he has weighed in on Peter Carey, Joyce Carol Oates, John le Carré, John Edgar Wideman and -- this week -- Michael Cunningham.

One of the poems is even . . . Victorian.

The voice on the other end belonged to Nic Harcourt, a disc jockey and host of a weekday music program, ""Morning Becomes Eclectic,"" on the Los Angeles public-radio station KCRW. Harcourt had received a copy of some unreleased self-produced ""demo"" recordings of Hoop's and had begun playing them on the air. Her song ""Seed of Wonder"" was especially popular: when it spun, the studio's phones lighted up and listeners in their cars pulled over to the side of the road, waiting for Harcourt to announce what it was.

While its competitors flirt with copyright violation by editing and reselling commercial DVD's, ClearPlay, based in Utah (actually, most of them are Utah-based), uses proprietary filtering technology to mute or skip past material without physically altering the DVD. The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, which President Bush signed in April, explicitly protects this approach from copyright-infringement lawsuits. By downloading ""filters"" configured for specific movies onto a DVD player equipped with the ClearPlay software, viewers (i.e., parents) can censor 14 types of violent, sexual and linguistic content in some 1,500 films. Joel Topcik put the technology to the test with a selection of famous scenes from films in ClearPlay's catalog.

Today -- thanks to protease inhibitors, combination therapy and other improvements in the treatment of the virus -- the average age of the approximately 135 H.I.V.-infected children being treated at F.C.C. is 13 and rising.

2005-06-27,Inside the List,"SAN FRANCISCO BLUES: Sentence by sentence, the most furiously written book on this week's hardcover best-seller list is almost certainly Sean Wilsey's memoir ""Oh the Glory of It All,"" which clings to the nonfiction list at No. 14. Wilsey's book takes no prisoners. It details the very public implosion of his parent's marriage -- his father was a charming multimillionaire, his mother a pushy and glamorous society columnist -- and his later life under the watchful eyes of a hated (and similarly well-connected) stepmother. ""Oh the Glory of It All"" is selling particularly well in San Francisco, Wilsey's hometown, where the book landed like a fragmentation bomb aimed at the city's elite. (Even Danielle Steel didn't escape the shrapnel; she was forced to deny Wilsey's claim she had an affair with his father.) The San Francisco Chronicle has treated the book like a major news event, printing a week's worth of excerpts, listing the names of those who dared to attend Wilsey's book party and drawing up lists of actors for the movie. While San Franciscans with long memories are buying Wilsey's memoir for the old-school dirt he dishes, Wilsey has cred with younger readers, too.

In truth, aside from its title, Anderson's book has very little to say about ""South Park"" itself; it's really just a retread of the argument that the mainstream media is losing its grip on world domination, marketed rather cynically to appeal to the same red-state radio hosts and book clubs that make so many right-wing polemics best sellers.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/magazine/king-of-the-hill-democrats.html

While the Canadian government said the proposed legislation, which was presented last week, is not related to any specific case, many Canadian critics of the Minmetals bid argued that it threatened Canada's national security. Other opponents of the deal cited China's human rights record, an issue not addressed by the proposed changes. Under its proposals, the government would also acquire the ability to review takeovers of any size for national security reasons.

But she denied trying to influence the vote count and insisted she would not resign, as some of her opponents have been demanding in a three-week-long political crisis over a secretly recorded telephone conversation between a woman who sounds like Mrs. Arroyo and a man said to be an election commissioner. In the recording, the woman asks if her lead could fall below a million votes and expresses concern about areas in the south. The man tells her, ""We will do our best."" The final tally gave her more than a million votes over her chief rival. In her address, Mrs. Arroyo said she had spoken to the election commissioner not because she wanted to influence the outcome of the election but because she was anxious to protect her votes. Members of her government said they hoped the apology would put the issue behind her. Carlos H.

He belonged to the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group whose members have often placed themselves between the Israeli forces and Palestinians. The court found that the former soldier, Taysir al-Heib, above, an Israeli sergeant at the time, had shot Mr. Hurndall with a sniper rifle using a telescopic sight. He was also convicted of obstruction of justice, submitting false testimony and obtaining false testimony. Sentencing is set for next week. Rights groups and Palestinians say that the Israeli military has killed many unarmed Palestinians, and a number of foreigners, and that the shootings are rarely investigated. Israel says that civilians are not the targets of military action and that it conducts inquiries in cases where soldiers are suspected of wrongdoing.

Beloved son of Clayton and Cynthia Morgan, of Austin; adored brother of Lillian and Elliot Morgan. Some people wear their spirit on the outside. When you meet them your own light shines brighter. When they're gone, you still have the treasures they gave away every day. Andy gave us the extra light we need to face his sudden passing. Andy was an accomplished photographer, cook, athlete, artist and lover of literature. He graduated from Pacific Lutheran University with a degree in business administration and a minor in jazz studies. He was the manager at Blue Ribbon Bakery in New York at the time of his death, meeting with an accident as he cycled to work. He had traveled to most of the continental U.S., Europe, central Asia, Mexico and South America. Andy taught us all how important every day is. He recently wrote in a letter to his family, ""Remember, now is as good a time as ever because we are here on earth together. I know I'll look back on these days with weak legs and a bitter sweet gravity pulling towards my heart because this is all we have, and I have so much love for you. In addition to his immediate family, Andy is survived by many other relatives in Texas. His family thanks his co-workers and the owners of Blue Ribbon Bakery, Eric, Bruce and Michael, also Tom Lowry and Rodean Landeaux, Rex and Ginalola for their support and help. A remembrance will be held at Blue Ribbon Bakery at noon Wednesday.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/classified/paid-notice-deaths-morgan-andrew-ross.html

Once upon a time -- for example, in 1938, when Orson Welles scared the bejesus out of America with his ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast -- the pop-cultural spectacle of invasion from outer space could raise some real alarm. Of course, as a thousand think pieces over the next week or so are sure to remind us, Welles's Martians were symbolic displacements of actual threats, a role that marauding space creatures have often been happy to take on, especially during the cold war. But with ""Mars Attacks!"" and ""Men in Black"" -- and even ""Independence Day"" -- the aliens and their minions at the studios began to get a little self-conscious and somewhat less ambitious.

Officers had been looking in the Port Authority Bus Terminal for a man wanted in a rape case in Brooklyn from 2002, police officials said. A man who seemed to match a photo of the suspect was chased down Eighth Avenue before he scurried into the building. The police did not find him there, but around 7:45 the man was taken into custody in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the police said, declining to release his name or other details. Around the time the police were searching the building, a suspicious package was found on a sidewalk at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue. The surrounding streets were cordoned off and a Rite-Aid store on the corner was evacuated. Firefighters said the package was deemed harmless.

He was born on December 31, 1912 in New York City to Morris Kline and Rebecca Norr Kline. He was educated at Evander Childs High School (1930) in New York and graduated from City College in 1934. During the Second World War, he served in the U.S. Army 44th Cavalry Recon as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S., Britain, France and Germany. During W.W.

A three-judge panel from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a lower court ruling on the grounds that too much time -- nearly 200 years -- had passed since the Cayugas lost the land in question. Christine Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, said the decision established a favorable precedent for the state in several other Indian land-claims cases. It also strengthened the hand of Governor Pataki in stop-and-start negotiations over the Cayugas' proposal to open a casino in the Catskills.
