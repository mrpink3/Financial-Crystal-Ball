2010-11-01,House Proud,"In 1924, the French designer Jean-Michel Frank collaborated with Hermès on a collection of furniture, including the Confortable armchair and sofa, the elegant, cubic forms of which made it one of the most admired — and widely copied — designs of the 20th century. This month in Paris, for the inauguration of its new home division, Maison, Hermès is reintroducing these and other Frank pieces, including a straw-marquetry screen, a shagreen-covered vanity and the designer’s X-base dining table. Robert Chavez, the president and C.E.O. of Hermès USA, sees ‘‘a very exciting potential in the U.S.’’ for the Jean-Michel Frank by Hermès collection, given the customer demand for furniture with the Hermès label. Previously, the company’s furniture was limited to Pippa, a small collection by the architect Rena Dumas, who designed Hermès stores and who was married to Jean-Louis Dumas, the chairman of Hermès from 1978 to 2006. (Rena died in 2009, and Jean-Louis in May.) Their son, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the company’s artistic director and a sixth-generation member of the founding Hermès family, said starting Maison with historic designs was a deliberate strategy: ‘‘We had to go backward to understand our roots and to go forward into the future.’’ And in that future — April 2011, to be exact — the company will unveil further Maison collections, this time by a roster of (yet to be revealed) contemporary designers.

Yet it also revealed his totalizing fear of actually having that kind of bond.Michael C. Hall’s performance here was really powerful: his face seemed to quiver and his body to recoil without actually doing so, as Lumen outlined her biography — her fear of marriage and of stifling convention, her need to breathe and experience thrills in life beyond having the right kind of china. Of course, this terror of dull, suburban normalcy is exactly what keeps Dexter so restive. He saw himself with frightening clarity in Lumen and is clearly afraid of what it might mean that the fates have delivered to him a woman who would not only accept his proclivities but also share them.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/dexter-watch-a-lethal-bond/

The first episode of the show, which had the good fortune to make its debut on Halloween night at 10 P.M., was watched by 5.3 million people, AMC said, making it the largest audience for any original series on the channel. (By comparison, the season finale of the AMC drama “Mad Men,” on which the dead do not reawaken and are simply made fodder for black comedy, drew 2.44 million viewers.) Not surprisingly, “The Walking Dead” performed particularly strongly with audience members aged 18 to 49, drawing 3.6 million viewers in that demographic. In a statement, AMC president Charlie Collier said, “It’s a good day to be dead,” and we’ll just leave it at that.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/its-alive-big-audience-for-debut-of-the-walking-dead/

2010-11-01,The Timing of Social Security,"Several readers have objected to my assertion, in today’s column, that Social Security was passed “amid strong economic growth, rather than at the bottom of a recession.” After all, wasn’t the program created during the Great Depression? So it was — but not, crucially, during F.D.R.’s first year in office, 1933, when the unemployment rate crested at 25 percent and economic growth was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the program was signed into law in August 1935, by which point the jobless rate was down to 20 percent and falling and the economy was growing at a brisk 8.9 percent clip, after growing by over 10 percent in 1934. By way of contrast, Barack Obama signed the health care bill in March of 2010, when unemployment had barely ticked down from its Great Recession high and G.D.P. growth was still anemic — as, indeed, it remains to this day. Of course it goes without saying that the overall economic situation was worse in the Depression. But Roosevelt could legitimately claim that the country had turned the corner (and, just as importantly, that the 1934 midterms had confirmed his political mandate) by the time he turned from economic policy to old-age entitlements. Obama, on the other hand, got his entitlement passed in the first 15 months of his administration — but one of the (many) reasons it’s been a harder sell than Social Security, I suspect, is that the country is still waiting for real growth to return.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/the-timing-of-social-security/

A defense lawyer countered that none of the money was given directly to Texas politicians and asserted that Mr. DeLay was guilty only of being a better politician than his Democratic opponents. The contributions helped Republicans take over the Texas House in 2002, paving the way for the passage of a redistricting plan — designed by Mr. DeLay — that gave Republicans more control over the state’s Congressional delegation.

Translation: no-brainer, well-made pieces like slouchy jumpsuits, cropped crepe tees and ombre chiffon sash dresses. And, at prices ranging from $150 to $500 a girl could easily go all out. “I never usually wear a complete Nomia look,” the 27-year-old designer insists. “I’ll incorporate an American Apparel or Salvation Army T-shirt to my wool and mesh leggings and biker jacket with a pair of vintage roper boots from Capezio.” Her “do try this at home” advice: just add some pieces from Uniqlo (“their jeans have a great fit and don’t stretch out”), Metropolis Apparel (43 Third Avenue) and Beacon’s Closet (88 North 11th Street, Brooklyn).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/now-in-the-mix-nomia/

2010-11-03,Stoked,"I grew up without a fireplace because my neurotic (but fabulous) parents were afraid of fire. So I’ve always been obsessed with them. In the house we built on Shelter Island, I put a bright orange vintage Preway in the bedroom. I had to search far and wide, and finally found the right one on Craigslist. The Preway is no longer in production, but you can still get free-standing fireplaces from Malm, a company out in Santa Rosa, Calif., that has been making them with great proportions and clean lines since the 1960s. (The one above is available from Design Within Reach.) When I am making a piece of pottery, I know that it’s finished — and that it’s good — if it looks like it’s supposed to be that way, like it’s been uncovered rather than created. To me, that’s a Malm fireplace. And I like that it’s democratic, not precious. At its height of popularity, you were as likely to see one in a mobile home as you were in a groovy modernist manse. Those who dismiss these beauties as a bit of ’70s nostalgia need to look again. I’m never happier than when I lie in bed and stare at my Preway, a glowing beacon of orange optimism in the corner of the room.  ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/stoked/

2010-11-03,To Soak or Not?,"In my column this week I divulge the fact that I no longer soak dried beans before cooking them. If you’re like me, and don’t know that you want to make bean stew until, well, the moment you want to make bean stew, then that eight-hour prep just isn’t in the cards.  That said, soaking beans overnight to soften them is really a great choice if you’re the kind of person who knows what you will want for dinner tomorrow. The eight hours or so spent in the water drastically reduces the cooking time. This saves energy and gets your dinner on the table faster once you bring everything to a boil. So feel free to soak the beans for this recipe if you’re so inclined. Just watch them carefully to see when they are done – probably in half the time it took me with unsoaked beans. Another issue that I briefly bring up in the column is refrigerating the beans while they soak. Years ago, I was taught that soaking beans might start to ferment if left in a very warm room overnight. Soaking in the fridge eliminates this concern. However, several readers have written to me saying that they never refrigerate their soaking beans and haven’t had any problems. One friend, from the Caribbean, said she always soaks her beans outside on the porch overnight in 80-degree weather, and that those beans seem to cook up perfectly well. I’m curious to hear how you do it – do you soak at room temperature or in the fridge?

Which is why, presumably, she fell so hard for pop-up books. ‘‘When a page closes, you see an object kind of smush, and in that moment, it’s in a liminal state not unlike the Fold paintings,’’ she says. Auerbach began collecting classic pop-ups like ‘‘Alphabeta Concertina’’ and ‘‘Andy Warhol’s Index (Book)’’ last year, and also began the process of making her own. To create ‘‘[2,3]’’ — which is being introduced this weekend by Printed Matter at the NY Art Book Fair — she spent months teaching herself how to construct complex geometric shapes from strips of paper, then several more creating templates and instructional videos so that the printer could reproduce them. Among the pieces are ‘‘Cubearc’’ (above), a delicate Möbius-like curl and ‘‘Ziggurat’’: 10 nested tiers that telescope out to 18 inches high. ‘‘I tried things that someone who had experience probably would have shied away from,’’ says Auerbach, who insists that her goal ‘‘wasn’t to make the most complicated thing possible. It was just to make something beautiful and uncanny happen.’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/eye-popping/

I’d never heard it before, or anything like it. I’d never heard of Elvis before. It was almost as if I’d been waiting for it to happen. When I woke up the next day I was a different guy. Suddenly I was getting overwhelmed: Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Little Richard, Fats. Radio Luxembourg was notoriously difficult to keep on station. I had a little aerial and walked round the room, holding the radio up to my ear and twisting the aerial. Trying to keep it down because I’d wake Mum and Dad up. If I could get the signal right, I could take the radio under the blankets on the bed and keep the aerial outside and twist it there. I’m supposed to be asleep; I’m supposed to be going to school in the morning. Loads of ads for James Walker, the jewelers “in every high street,” and the Irish sweepstakes, with which Radio Lux had some deal.

The route connects an existing line with a new 14-mile extension. City officials say they hope the new line will help alleviate clogged roads. In recent months, Beijing residents have complained that traffic in and around the city has been worse than anytime in years. A recent traffic jam from outside Beijing toward Inner Mongolia lasted for 10 days and drew international attention. Xinhua reported that Beijing has four million cars on the roads, and the city is one of the most congested in the world. Beijing plans to open four other new lines by the end of 2010.

J. Abrams of “Lost” and it had kicked off a bidding war among the networks last year when Mr. Abrams pitched the idea. The show, about two spectacular-looking undercover agents who also happen to be a married couple running a high-end catering business, was also notable because its stars were black. Scheduled on Wednesdays at 8 p.m., the show never took off in the ratings, and the numbers that arrived Thursday for the previous night revealed it had hit a new low. Only about 5.8 million viewers tuned in. NBC said it would probably still broadcast the six remaining episodes that have been produced.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/arts/television/05arts-NBCTOCANCELU_BRF.html

2010-11-05,The God-Science Shouting Match: A Response,"In reading the nearly 700 reader responses to my Oct. 17 essay for The Stone, (“Morals Without God?“) I notice how many readers are relieved to see that there are shades of gray when it comes to the question whether morality requires God. I believe that such a discussion needs to revolve around both the distant past, in which religion likely played little or no role if we go back far enough, and modern times, in which it is hard to disentangle morality and religion. The latter point seemed obvious to me, yet proved controversial. Even though 90 percent of my text questions the religious origins of human morality, and wonders if we need a God to be good, it is the other 10 percent — in which I tentatively assign a role to religion — that drew most ire. Atheists, it seems (at least those who responded here) don’t like any less than 100 percent agreement with their position.To have a productive debate, religion needs to recognize the power of the scientific method and the truths it has revealed, but its opponents need to recognize that one cannot simply dismiss a social phenomenon found in every major society. If humans are inherently religious, or at least show rituals related to the supernatural, there is a big question to be answered. The issue is not whether or not God exists — which I find to be a monumentally uninteresting question defined, as it is, by the narrow parameters of monotheism — but why humans universally feel the need for supernatural entities. Is this just to stay socially connected or does it also underpin morality? And if so, what will happen to morality in its absence?",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/the-god-science-shouting-match-a-response/

In Alex Gibney’s new documentary, “Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,” Mr. Spitzer says that hubris played a role in his stumble. Like Peter Elkind’s recent book, “Rough Justice: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,” the movie quotes from a 2005 speech in which Mr. Spitzer jokingly describes a T-shirt that he was given with “Hubris is terminal” on it.

As the United States approached the central crisis in its history, there was no reason to expect great eloquence from the man whose election had precipitated that conflict. Abraham Lincoln was often described as an uncouth barbarian, and had received the least education of any presidential nominee in American history, save Andrew Jackson. Yet there he was in the fall of 1860, standing before the American people, the embodiment of their hopes and fears. In this politically charged atmosphere, the words that flowed from his pen, and his equally expressive silences, did a great deal to define the conflict coming into view. This occasional feature in the Disunion series will probe Lincoln’s language, looking at his speeches and public pronouncements during the long transition between his election eve on Nov. 5, 1860, and his First Inaugural Address on March 4, 1861.

2010-11-05,California: Competency Hearing Set In Kidnap Trial," A judge in the trial of Philip and Nancy Garrido, accused of kidnapping Jaycee Dugard in 1991 and holding her for 18 years, has set a tentative date in March for a mental competency hearing for Mr. Garrido. Judge Douglas Phimister said that would allow time for court-appointed psychiatrists to evaluate Mr. Garrido. The Garridos were arrested in 2009 at their home outside Antioch, Calif., where Mr. Garrido is accused of holding Ms. Dugard and two children he fathered by her. She was 11 at the time of her kidnapping. Several news organizations have sought to have transcripts of Ms. Dugard’s grand jury testimony released. Stephen A. Tapson, a lawyer for Ms. Garrido, objects to releasing them, saying they described “a tale of woe and misfortune” that would prejudice a jury. “This stuff is evil,” Mr. Tapson said.

They’re not quite mating dances; they’re more like strenuously casual preinterviews for a first date, full of mutual courtesies designed to prevent any hurt feelings. Accordingly, Winger arrived prepared — not only with a list of questions and ideas about the role, but also with the names of several other performers the producers might want to pursue instead of her if she wasn’t the right fit. “I had in my head the names of five other actresses,” she said, “all of whom I thought would, in a way, be better.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative activist group, laid out plans for repealing President Obama’s health care reform and fighting environmental regulation at its Defending the American Dream Summit two months ago. The president, meanwhile, closed this fall’s campaign with an exhortation to “restore the American dream for not just some, but for every, every, everybody in this great land.” If both sides agree that the dream is imperiled, and that recovering it is a top national priority, then it may be this “dream”of ours is not a unifying idea but a vague slogan, no more to be trusted than any other piece of campaign rhetoric.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/magazine/07FOB-WWLN-t.html

I let myself hope that Dennis would be content to stay semi-in-the-closet so he could keep his job teaching music at a Catholic school in the Bronx, that he might be content to feel subversive playing the organ in the choir loft while wearing ladies’ underpants. I should have known better: Dennis had always been capable of achieving with surprising speed things that seemed impossible, like saving up from his paper route to buy a pool table while in grade school. Within days of telling me he was transsexual, he was taking hormones.

Collins, a columnist for the New York Times Op-Ed page, combines capsule histories and the drama of the era with the memories of regular women who lived through it all. These were times, Collins writes, in which women “were not meant to compete with men, to act independently of men. . . . Then, suddenly, everything changed. The cherished convictions about women and what they could do were smashed in the lifetime of many of the women living today.” SARAH FROM ALASKA:  The Sudden Rise and Brutal Education of a New Conservative Superstar, by Scott Conroy and Shushannah Walshe.

But ever since the success of books as different as Laurie Halse Anderson’s “Speak” (1999), a grittily realistic portrait of sexual violence in high school, and “Twilight,” it’s become clear that writers have at least as much freedom in Y.A. books as they do in adult fiction, as well as an audience that is loyal, smart and self-renewing.

The director Tony Scott has found his go-to hero, an often flawed, seemingly ordinary guy who rises to the occasion, in the Oscar winner Denzel Washington. Together the unlikely pairing of the British action director who specializes in fast-paced, stylized action flicks (“Top Gun,” “The Last Boy Scout”) and an American leading man typically associated for his stirring portrayals of inspirational men like Malcolm X and the football coach Herman Boone, have made five films together. In their latest, “Unstoppable”  the others are “Crimson Tide,” “Man on Fire,” “Déjà Vu” and “The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,” from last year  Mr. Washington plays a veteran engineer who must safely halt an out-of-control locomotive in Pennsylvania carrying combustible liquids, with or without the assistance of his headstrong rookie conductor (Chris Pine).

The Philadelphia Museum of Art is celebrating the 90-year-old company with an exhibition, ‘‘Alessi: Ethical and Radical,’’ which opens Nov. 21. Central to Alessi’s success is its creative mastermind, Alberto Alessi, a grandson of the founder, who has run the company since the 1970s. ‘‘He’s absolutely unique in the amount of time and money that he has spent on design,’’ said Kathryn Hiesinger, the exhibition’s curator. Included in the show are planned reissues of designs from the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s, a time that Alberto Alessi describes as ‘‘predesign,’’ before the rise of glossy ‘‘designer’’ products — which is ironic coming from the man who helped invent the category. But, as Heisinger explained, ‘‘Alberto is now in his minimalist, simplicity mode; he’s against overdesign.’’ Well, he’s been right before.

On Nov. 20, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art will open ‘‘How Wine Became Modern: Design and Wine 1976 to Now.’’ Organized by Henry Urbach, the museum’s curator of architecture and design, the exhibition — which is designed by the architects Diller Scofidio and Renfro — explores the evolution of wine’s visual and material culture. It includes a gallery devoted to the subject of terroir, a commissioned wall work by Peter Wegner that charts more than 200 paint colors with names like Cabernet and Crush, and a look at, among other issues, the effect of architecture on wine tourism. The museum knows the subject well, having organized the first architectural competition for the design of a winery, in 1985. The winner was the architect-artist team of Michael Graves and Edward Schmidt, resulting in Clos Pegase, the prototype of the modern designer winery.

2010-11-08,Germany: 18-Year-Old Faces Charges of Terrorism Over Internet Videos," An 18-year-old man was arrested in northwest Germany on Friday on charges that he posted three videos on the Internet in October threatening terrorist attacks unless a convicted terrorist serving a 12-year prison term was released, the police said. The police said the suspect, whom they would not identify because he might be tried as a juvenile, uploaded three crude yet threatening videos onto YouTube. He also downloaded bomb-making manuals from the Internet, but was unable to make explosives because he did not have money for materials. In the videos, the man hid his face while claiming to speak on behalf of what he called the German mujahedeen. He demanded the release from prison of Daniel Schneider, the leader of the so-called Sauerland Cell, whose members were convicted in March 2010 for planning attacks on United States military installations in Germany. The police said that there was no evidence that the suspect was linked with Al Qaeda or any terrorist groups but that he had become a dangerous longer.

Mr. Ban said that China was on the path to political reform and building a society based on the rule of law. “I hope that the Chinese government will further expand the space for civil society and take further steps that reflect and uphold its commitment to international human rights standards,” he said at a news conference. He stopped short of calling on China to release imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, an award that infuriated Beijing. China is one of five permanent Security Council members that can veto Mr. Ban’s quest for a second term starting in 2012. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/world/06briefs-UNITEDNATIONS.html

2010-11-08,Britain: Citizenship Restored to Cleric Wanted on Terrorism Charges in U.S.," A British government ruling stripping the Egyptian-born Muslim cleric known as Abu Hamza al-Masri of his British citizenship was struck down Friday by a special immigration court. But government officials said the court’s action would not affect the government’s plan to extradite the cleric to the United States, where he is wanted on terrorism charges. Officials in the office of Home Secretary Theresa May said no decision had been made on whether to appeal the immigration court’s ruling to a higher British court. The immigration panel upheld the claim by lawyers for Mr. Hamza, 53, whose real name is Mostafa Kamel Mostafa, that losing the British citizenship he gained through marriage in 1986 would leave him stateless, because Egypt’s government has revoked his Egyptian citizenship. He has carried his fight to avoid extradition to the European Court of Human Rights. He is wanted in the United States, where he is accused in connection with a plot to establish a terrorism training camp in Oregon, and is alleged to have had a role in planning a terrorist ambush in Yemen in 1998 in which 16 foreign tourists, some of them Americans, were taken hostage. Four hostages were subsequently killed. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/world/europe/06briefs-CLERIC.html

The waste, which was created in German nuclear power plants and treated in France by Areva, was returning for storage in Gorleben, in Lower Saxony. The protesters called the shipment “the most radioactive ever,” an accusation contested by Areva, which had melted the waste, mixed it in glass and put it into containers.

2010-11-08,France: Roma Expelled From Church," About 13 Roma were expelled Friday from a church just south of Paris, the third expulsion of Roma in the past few days. The 13, including two adolescents, had been in France for a decade and had been moved from a squat. They took refuge in the church of St.-Nicolas de St.-Maur-des-Fossés hoping for better lodging, but were removed after the priest there signed an expulsion order. On Wednesday, two encampments of Roma  one nearby at Créteil and the other in Lyon, were also emptied by the police. France was sharply criticized this summer for a more intense effort to expel Roma who are non-French and who overstay their three-month visa, and for breaking up illegal encampments of Roma and traveling people, including French citizens, who have been living on land not designated for them by municipalities. France says Romania and Bulgaria must do more to integrate their Roma citizens, and spend more of the money the European Union provides for that purpose. But the Roma say they are not wanted in Romania. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/world/europe/06briefs-ROMA.html

A public outcry followed, and ultimately led to her resignation. Many such incidents of abuse and offense, often with much more serious consequences, seem to appear in the news by the day.

The piece, “On Earth Together,” created to celebrate the company’s 25th anniversary, will run Feb. 8 to 13. Other companies will present well-known pieces and new works during the season, which runs through August. Highlights are to include the world premiere of “Dark Habits” (March 8 to 13), an examination of fashion and drama from Keigwin + Company; and the New York premiere of “Chapters From a Broken Novel” from Doug Varone & Dancers, with a score played live by David Van Tieghem, the composer (March 15 to 20). The Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which has been presenting works at the Joyce since 1984, will offer perhaps the most somber performance of the season.

2010-11-08,Dreamworks Animation’s ‘Megamind’ Is a Megahit,"DreamWorks Animation has another hit on its hands: “Megamind,” the story of a supervillain turned superhero, which reached No. 1 with an estimated $47.7 million in its opening weekend at the North American box office, according to Hollywood.com, a compiler of box-office statistics. That result is better than the opening for the studio’s hit “How to Train Your Dragon,” which sold $43.7 million in its first weekend, but lower than initial results for its pictures like “Kung Fu Panda” and “Monsters vs. Aliens.” In an unusual move “Megamind,” distributed by Paramount Pictures, saved a substantial part of its television marketing push to avoid competing with midterm election ads; 40 percent of the film’s TV advertising budget was spent over the past week. The comedy “Due Date” (Warner Brothers) was second, with a strong $33.5 million. The Lionsgate drama “For Colored Girls,” adapted by Tyler Perry from Ntozake Shange’s seminal play, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,” was third with a solid $20.1 million. The ensemble action film “RED” (Summit Entertainment) chugged away in fourth place with $8.9 million for a new total of $71.9 million. “Saw 3D” (Lionsgate) was fifth with about $8.2 million for a new total of $38.8 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/movies/08arts-DREAMWORKSAN_BRF.html
2010-11-08,A Free Evening of Arts for the Military,"The actors Adam Driver (“Mrs. Warren’s Profession”) and Joanne Tucker (“Little Doc”), both below, will present an evening of free jazz and readings for military personnel, veterans and their families on Monday night at American Airlines Theater. It will be the first performance by their group, Arts in the Armed Forces, since it gained nonprofit status in September. David Cromer will direct performances by actors including Eric Bogosian, Susan Sarandon, Dianne Wiest and Lauren Ambrose, among others, in honor of Veterans Day. Mr. Driver, a former Marine lance corporal, said by telephone on Sunday that the idea for the company came from a need that he and Ms. Tucker, whom he met while studying theater at Juilliard, noticed for more culturally diverse entertainment for the troops. “We called U.S.O. events ‘mandatory fun,’ ” Mr. Driver said of his time in the Marines, citing an event that included a skateboarding demonstration and a contest to win a date with a San Diego Chargers cheerleader. “You couldn’t help but feel marginalized.” Now they hope their organization will encourage dialogue between artists and military members. “In a place where emotions are not talked about, there seemed a need,” Mr. Driver said. “Putting words to feelings is a powerful thing, and theater was the best way for me to do that.” The readings include works from the playwrights John Patrick Shanley, a former Marine who will introduce the evening, Charles Fuller (“A Soldier’s Play”) and Stephen Adly Guirgis (“The Little Flower of East Orange”). Their plays have a “grittier edge,” Ms. Tucker said, but are not necessarily about the military.

Intended to display the refurbished hall’s versatility, the festival will present relatively small-scale presentations spanning the centuries from the Baroque, in programs by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants (music of Rameau) and Jordi Savall and Hespèrion XXI (music of Spain and Mexico), to the present, with Heiner Goebbels’s semistaged concert work “Songs of Wars I Have Seen,” of 2007.

Les Percussions de Strasbourg will offer the New York premiere of Gérard Grisey’s “Noir de l’Étoile” and a Xenakis program.

The Leaf can go about 100 miles on a full charge, so if you’re planning on roving into the wilderness of no charging stations (Hertz is working on building an infrastructure of stations nationwide), you’re better off with the slightly less saintly hybrids, like Priuses and Volts, also available.

They provide immediate fuel for straining muscles, keep blood-sugar levels stable and allow you to work out for a longer period of time or at a higher intensity, or both, than if you don’t swallow any extra fuel. But why wouldn’t taking in protein, together with carbohydrates, during a workout or race make you even more speedy and durable? Protein, after all, is what muscles fundamentally are made of, so it seems reasonable to imagine that adding it to sports drinks could provide some additional benefit.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/do-protein-sports-drinks-improve-performance/

One of the most indelible ads in fashion history, the image was part of a niche campaign that included a Peggy Olsen-worthy tagline — “Are you made for Fire & Ice?” — and a bizarre questionnaire that asked, ‘Have you ever wanted to wear an ankle bracelet?’ and ‘Does gypsy music make you sad?’ While a lot has changed since 1952, Fire & Ice has a new shelf life now that Revlon has re-released three “lip-and-tip” pairings ($4.79 – $ 8.99). The ad, shot by Mario Testino, restages the original, with a few notable exceptions — the actress Jessica Biel stands in for Leigh, ankle bracelets are so last century, and that dress is no knockoff.

2010-11-11,A Final Cocoon: Dying at Home," THERE is some confusion about the cause of the liver disease that has given Fred Kress a short time to live. The 46-year-old handyman and house painter, who lives outside of Baltimore, had had hepatitis C, which causes liver damage, for several years. Doctors at one point suggested that alcohol abuse may have been a contributing factor, which makes no sense, Mr. Kress and his family say, because he was never much of a drinker. The real culprit, he now believes, was chemical: he didn’t wear the right mask when he was painting houses, and when he did his craft projects, making alien masks out of fiberglass resin, he worked in a small, windowless room, ignoring all the warning labels on the supplies he used.

At their most fanciful, her clothes summon a dream of fun-loving womanhood, of idols and heroines: Janis Joplin, Marie Antoinette and Marisa Berenson on the dance floor, all in a single collection. But reverie hardly explains Sui’s loved and labored métier. She started her eponymous collection in 1981 while working a day job, and opened her New York boutique in 1992 – the first of 300 sales outlets – just a year after her first runway show. Since 1997, Sui has also parlayed licensing deals in cosmetics, accessories and spin-off clothing lines that extend from Turkey to Japan. A new anthology published by Chronicle Books suggests that the lynchpin of her unique career is encyclopedic curiosity as much as commercial acumen, studied process and a deep respect for the techniques and traditions of her craft.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/asked-answered-anna-sui/

2010-11-12,Post-Tea-Party Nation," Republicans lost the presidency in 2008 in large part because of the worst economic crisis since World War II. Republicans have now regained the House of Representatives for the same reason. In the interval, Republicans ferociously attacked the Obama administration’s economic remedies, and there certainly was a lot to attack. But the impulse to attack, it must be recognized, was based on more than ideology; it also served important psychological imperatives. Not since Jimmy Carter handed the office to Ronald Reagan — arguably not since Herbert Hoover yielded to Franklin Roosevelt — had a president of one party bequeathed a successor from another party so utter an economic disaster as George W. Bush bequeathed to Barack Obama. And while the Bush administration took wise and bold steps to correct the disaster, the unpopularity of its Troubled Asset Relief Program bequeathed the Obama administration a political disaster alongside the economic disaster.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14FOB-idealab-t.html

While Priscilla, 35, settles in to work at home and care for their 2-year-old, Jerry, 42, shuttles the older two children to school and heads to his office. He spends much of the day negotiating her speaking invitations and her book contracts. In the afternoon it’s often Jerry who collects the boys from school. Back home, Priscilla and Jerry divide chores and child care equally. “He will most often jump in and do the dinner dishes,” Priscilla says. “We don’t have, ‘these are wife tasks and these are husband tasks.’ . . .

Often the problem afflicts low-income areas abandoned or shunned by food businesses that focus on better-off consumers; the residents of food deserts, apparently, are not providing enough profit to be offered more healthful grub.

As in the case of the psychologist mentioned in the article, Rachel, too, had been nearly asymptomatic. Following an airplane trip from Philadelphia to Albuquerque, she had an edema in her legs that her internist attributed to long periods of sitting on planes. Initial tests revealed nothing unusual. When the edema persisted, more tests were ordered, and the CT scan showed Stage 4 cancer.

They both live with their children’s fathers, have adequate income, college education, power and advantage. The status they have achieved, regardless of how, is their common denominator. But at a time when America’s poor mothers are struggling to feed, educate and keep their children safe, sometimes without the support of a partner, being a mom elicits a whole different meaning for millions of women the article never mentions. Being a grizzly for them means fighting with the “welfare folks” who may have inadvertently canceled their food stamps; standing up to an absentee landlord when the heater breaks in the middle of winter; or figuring out how to manage a lottery system so her kid can get into the one decent magnet school in her city.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Letters-t-THENEWMOMISM_LETTERS.html

2010-11-12,"Letters: Good News, Bad News","I was troubled by Rob Walker’s slipshod correlation in his otherwise fascinating examination of the Gap’s recent logo problems. In seeking to argue that the publicity generated by the logo might be good for the company’s sales, he cites a recent paper in Marketing Science that found that negative book reviews in The New York Times bolster obscure authors’ sales and hurt established authors’ sales. The bad publicity, the paper argues, serves to increase awareness of the book, which in turn fuels sales. Walker’s analogy with the Gap’s logo issues, however, is poor, and comparing apparel and books is a mismatched venture at best. In the analogy, Gap jeans are novels, but a more accurate publishing parallel would be an imprint redesigning its logo, something that most likely has never caused much of a stir outside of publishing house offices. Why? The Gap has builta brand on its logo, while books are judged one product at a time. Although his theories on publicity are interesting, Walker’s apples-and-oranges argument is a blatant attempt to place a scientific basis behind his theories on the Gap’s logo.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Letters-t-GOODNEWSBADN_LETTERS.html

I’m glad Appiah uses foot binding in China as his chief positive example of change rather than female genital cutting (F.G.C.) — not “mutilation,” as your subtitle suggests. I remember being in Kenya in 1980 when women from that country came back from the U.N. conference on the status of women in Copenhagen, angered by Western women’s cultural insensitivity to what Kenyan (and other African) women viewed as their issue. Female circumcision is limited to northern Africa and along the eastern coast. It was rarely seen in central and southern Africa. It is time that The Times Magazine adopted the more appropriate term “cutting,” which both Appiah and Nicholas Kristof use in their articles, rather than the socially charged term “mutilation.” Times reporters have changed over the past 10 years and adopted F.G.C. as the operative term.

Enough, in fact, to fill a store, which opened in the South End of Boston two weeks ago. “Our collection had expanded into a lot of new categories, and we wanted a space where we could show everything together,” explained Ross, referring to himself and his co-owner, Don Carney. “We found an ideal space in the back of a brick-lined courtyard in our favorite Boston neighborhood, and it felt like a perfect location to create a Patch NYC world.” That world includes the company’s jewelry, scarves, candles and pillows, along with original art by Carney,  who hails from Boston. Also in the mix are a selection of porcelain from the Brooklyn-based designers Klein Reid, ceramic sculptures by the Boston-based artist Steve Murphy and vintage decorative objects and Indian textiles.

2010-11-12,A Good Day to Die,"In the Indian wars of the 1870s, Sioux tribesmen used a tactic against the United States Cavalry known as a “brave run” or a “dare ride.” An Indian warrior would gallop close to the American soldiers, drawing their fire. The purpose was partly practical — to get the soldiers to waste their ammunition — and partly psychological — to taunt. The Sioux sometimes showed their contempt for their enemies by appearing naked or nearly so, displaying their genitals and buttocks. Then the Indians would close in. “Soldiers always tried to keep an enemy at bay, to kill him at a distance,” Thomas Powers writes in “The Killing of Crazy Horse,” his richly textured account of clashing civilizations on the Great Plains during the late 19th century. “The instinct of Sioux fighters was for exactly the opposite: to charge in and touch the enemy with a quirt, bow or naked hand while he was still alive. There is no terror in battle to equal physical contact — shouting, hot breath, the grip of a hand from a man close enough to smell.” The whites were repulsed by the smell of Indians — “an odor resembling a mixture of smoked beef, muskrat and polecat,” according to a correspondent for Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly quoted by Powers; “a pungent, musty odor something like that of combined smoke and grease,” Lt. William Philo Clark, a cavalry officer, wrote. For the Sioux “who wanted nothing to do with whites, visceral differences like smell were only the beginning,” Powers writes. The Indians particularly resented white treatment of Indian women. “Many whites beat or abused Indian women, exploited them sexually after capture in battle, and sometimes bought them for cheap trinkets and liquor and later cast them aside.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/books/review/Thomas-t.html
2010-11-12,The Hipster in the Mirror,"A  year ago, my colleagues and I started to investigate the contemporary hipster. What was the “hipster,” and what did it mean to be one? It was a puzzle. No one, it seemed, thought of himself as a hipster, and when someone called you a hipster, the term was an insult. Paradoxically, those who used the insult were themselves often said to resemble hipsters — they wore the skinny jeans and big eyeglasses, gathered in tiny enclaves in big cities, and looked down on mainstream fashions and “tourists.” Most puzzling was how rattled sensible, down-to-earth people became when we posed hipster-themed questions. When we announced a public debate on hipsterism, I received e-mail messages both furious and plaintive. Normally inquisitive people protested that there could be no answer and no definition. Maybe hipsters didn’t exist! The responses were more impassioned than those we’d had in our discussions on health care, young conservatives and feminism.

For example, if a team had a payroll of $256 billion dollars against a luxury tax threshold of $40 billion, and one of their players was earning $220 billion alone, using the amnesty clause on that player would then put that team under the luxury tax threshold (as their payroll for luxury tax purposes was now considered to be only $36 billion).

At the end of the column, I asked readers if they had ideas for ways to reduce bullying. Many offered suggestions about organizations, techniques and books (some of which I list at the bottom of this column), but many more readers reflected on their own experiences having witnessed bullying or the surprising effect babies can have on children and teenagers.Christine, from Montpelier, Vt., (35), recounted her experiences driving a school bus accompanied by her baby boy in a car seat behind her. When necessary, she would place “unruly students” ─ mostly in grades four through eight ─ near her, as well. “[T]hey started to ask to sit in the front … so that they could play and read and talk to him during the ride.

In the days following, newspaper headlines screamed it from one city to another, across the not very united states.

In the days following the verdict, an enormous range of Americans, from all walks of life, wrote to their president-elect to express their feelings about where the country was headed. These letters present a remarkable documentary portrait of a nation at a crossroads. ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/lincolns-mailbag/

His observations on subtlety, the play of light and dark, and, for that matter, all things Japanese, have lately been on the minds of Alexa Adams and Flora Gill, the design duo behind the label Ohne Titel. ‘‘While I was reading his work, I felt like I was experiencing this slice of traditional Japanese aesthetics visually,’’ Adams says. Adds Gill, ‘‘It’s almost a goal toward perfect design, which as designers we’re always searching for.’’ In their spring 2011 collection, the pair softened their usual aggressive silhouettes with nods to the Orient: striped ribbed knitwear inspired by the Japanese woodblock print artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, linen tie-front pants, jackets with kimono-style volume in the sleeves. The two recently made their inaugural trip to Japan, traveling to Kyoto to take in tea ceremonies, ancient temples and Noh theater.

By Friday a dozen members still had not received visas, so the performances were postponed. Word came over the weekend that the remaining visas had been granted.

2010-11-16,First Look | Bergdorf’s Holiday Windows,"On Monday afternoon, Bergdorf Goodman’s display guru David Hoey gave The Moment an exclusive peek at the department store’s holiday windows, which won’t be unveiled until later this week. As Hoey drew up the heavy tarps covering each of them, a crowd of flash-happy tourists appeared (not to mention our very own Bill Cunningham, who was on the street, as is his wont). Still works in progress, the windows are being pored over by a team of artists. Hoey oversees the whole production, the culmination of a year’s efforts, and he often can be seen on Fifth Avenue, instructing his minions. Can they hear him through all that glass? “If I stand exactly at 14-and-a-half inches from the window, the glass becomes a natural megaphone and they can hear me perfectly,” he says. This year the windows are dedicated not so much to the act of travel as the fantasies that trip-taking might engender: flying horses, flying machines, and a journey to the moon. Bergdorf’s best windows over the past two decades are collected in a new $550 hand-made book by Assouline, part of its exquisitely crafted “Ultimate Collection,” which weighs a ton and goes on sale this week at Bergdorf and bergdorfgoodman.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/first-look-bergdorfs-holiday-windows/

The exhibition was largely made possible by the perseverance of Shelly Verthime, the show’s curator, and Guy Bourdin’s son Samuel Bourdin.

That would change under a proposal by the national commission charged with reducing the deficit. In its draft report last week it recommended that the Smithsonian’s federal appropriation be cut by $225 million, or roughly 30 percent, and that the institution make up the loss by charging a $7.50 admission fee. The Smithsonian’s spokeswoman, Linda St. Thomas, said by telephone that the Smithsonian had studied the idea of charging admission several times in recent decades and rejected it. “The regents have said repeatedly we don’t want to charge admission because it then makes it difficult for all people to come and visit the collections, which in theory are held in trust for the American people,” Ms. St. Thomas said.

2010-11-17,Phys Ed: The Workout Enigma,"Recently, researchers in Finland made the discovery that some people’s bodies do not respond as expected to weight training, others don’t respond to endurance exercise and, in some lamentable cases, some don’t respond to either. In other words, there are those who just do not become fitter or stronger, no matter what exercise they undertake. To reach this conclusion, the researchers enrolled 175 sedentary adults in a 21-week exercise program. Some lifted weights twice a week. Others jogged or walked. Some did both. Before and after the program, the volunteers’ fitness and muscular strength were assessed. At the end of the 21 weeks, the results, published earlier this year in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, were mixed. In the combined strength-and-endurance-exercise program, the volunteers’ physiological improvement ranged from a negative 8 percent (meaning they became 8 percent less fit) to a positive 42 percent. The results were similar in the groups that undertook only strength or only endurance training. Some improved their strength enormously, some not at all. Others became aerobically fitter but not stronger, while still others showed no improvements in either area. Only a fortunate few became both fitter and more buff. As the researchers from the University of Jyvaskyla wrote with some understatement, “large individual differences” exist “in the responses to both endurance and strength training.”",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/phys-ed-the-workout-enigma/

The mayor, Leonid M. Chernovetsky, left, had seemed to survive in office because Ukraine’s squabbling political factions did not know how to handle him and could not agree on a successor. But the president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, who was elected this year, ousted Mr. Chernovetsky as head of the city’s administration and appointed a senior municipal official, Oleksandr Popov, to succeed him. Through a quirk in the law, Mr. Chernovetsky will continue for now as nominal head of the city, but Mr. Popov will wield the authority, officials said.

No one in the Ampatuan family, long a dominant political force in Maguindanao Province, was charged in the older killings, whose victims included political opponents and their relatives, public officials, people whose land the family wanted, and members of the Ampatuans’ own organization who disobeyed orders, the report said. Andal Ampatuan Jr., son of the family patriarch, is on trial for the Nov. 23, 2009, killings in Maguindanao, whose 57 victims included about 30 journalists and media support staff members who were with a group of people on their way to file candidacy papers for a political rival of Mr. Ampatuan.

2010-11-17,The Palin Network," On the night of the midterm elections earlier this month, Sarah Palin stayed up until 3 in the morning. From her hotel bedroom in Manhattan, she and her husband, Todd, followed the returns while she wrote e-mails on her iPad — congratulating winners, consoling losers — while reading others from people who wanted her to know that they had cast their vote for her daughter Bristol on “Dancing With the Stars” the evening before. Like much of her recent life, Palin’s day had been replete with reminders of the clout she had rapidly acquired. She had spent most of her time ensconced at the Fox television studios, though she managed to squeeze in a jog in Central Park — which she promptly chronicled on Twitter: “Beautiful!” Also at the studios was her fellow Fox News contributor Karl Rove, who had recently questioned in a British newspaper whether Palin’s new reality TV series, “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” made her appear Oval Office-worthy. The building was abuzz over what would ensue when the two would inevitably bump into each other. The moment came after Palin finished a segment with the anchor Bret Baier and saw Rove lingering stageside with Brit Hume, a Fox colleague, holding a well-marked copy of “Alaska for Dummies” — a prop clearly intended to mollify Palin. She laughed, used her phone’s camera to take a picture of Rove with the book, traded brief hellos and then left the studio without mentioning Rove’s earlier comment.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/magazine/21palin-t.html

That was far from the 701,000 her first album opened with last year, but it was enough to take the top spot from Ms. Swift, whose “Speak Now” (Big Machine) moved 212,000 in its third week out.

2010-11-18,Cooking With Dexter: Dad’s Weird Suppers,"Bacon ﬁsh is the kind of dinner that doesn’t lend itself to a recipe, but here’s how I made it, more or less. Last Saturday, a friend from Oregon came to visit, and we served him bacon and eggs for lunch around noon, with a quince crisp after. The eggs were full of spinach with a flicker of nutmeg, and the bacon was roasted in the oven, just before the crisp went in. This was bacon from real pigs, old-fashioned pigs, and a pound gave off nearly a cup of grease, for which I said silent thanks.

The compensation payments were explained in Parliament as part of a government plan to free MI5 and MI6 from the threat of extended litigation, and to protect relations between the British intelligence agencies and their American counterparts. Jonathan Evans, MI5’s director general, said in a statement that he was “delighted” with the decision not to prosecute the unnamed MI5 official.

2010-11-18,Berlusconi’s Statue of Mars and Venus Are Made Whole Again," The statue of Mars and Venus that greets visitors to the official residence of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is a striking example of classical Roman sculpture but to certain observers it seemed incomplete. Dating back to 175 A.D., the representation of Venus was missing one of her hands, and her companion, Mars, was missing the very feature that some might say made him such a manly god of war. But the work at Palazzo Chigi in Rome has been restored to anatomical completeness, The Guardian reported: Venus now has all of her digits and Mars was given a new penis. The Italian newspaper La Repubblica said Mr. Berlusconi had requested the restoration of the statue, but Mario Catalano, the prime minister’s architect, told The Guardian, “I took the decision.” Mr. Catalano added that the replacement parts were attached using a magnetic system and were removable but declined to provide additional details.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/berlusconis-statue-of-mars-and-venus-are-made-whole-again/

Not only was Godard’s 1967 film “La Chinoise” the inspiration for Sternberg’s fall 2009 collection, but his fashion label’s own name, Band of Outsiders, comes from the English title of Godard’s canonical 1964 film “Bande à Part.” Sternberg has himself shot all of the Band of Outsiders look-books with a Polaroid camera, which means he’s probably willing to take Godard’s axiom a step further: There’s no point in having sharp images when you can have fuzzy ones.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/band-practice/

Instead of showing the typical touristy side of Paris, Schecter created an almost abstract view of the city— he photographed people walking with umbrellas from above, the shadows of chairs in the Luxembourg Gardens and the Eiffel Tower in a layer of mist. “His photos capture a Paris that’s not a postcard-perfect city,” says Leach, who served as the longtime creative director for Kate Spade. “It’s a raw Paris that shows history and modernity wrestling with each other.” The prints will be available starting today at  www.chanceco.com ($250 for each 17-by-24-inch unframed image from the limited edition of 250).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/abstract-expression/

2010-11-19,"Ann Beattie, Distilling Her Generation","One thing that this collection of short stories by Ann Beattie makes it possible to do is imagine your way into the head of a New Yorker fiction editor at the moment of discovery. Roger Angell turned down more than a dozen stories sent to the magazine over 22 months by a very young Beattie, who was then in the process of dropping out of a graduate English program. But he wrote encouraging rejections (“I hope you will let us see more of your work, and that you will address your future submissions directly to me”) and finally accepted “A Platonic Relationship” (“What I like most about the story is its sparsity. Almost everything except the essential has been done away with, leaving one with the vision of a Giacometti”). The story was published on April 8, 1974, when Beattie was 26 years old. Reading it all these years later, you may have to work a little to pick up the electrical currents pulsing beneath its dry, self-contained surface — Beattie’s style wasn’t called “minimalist” for nothing — but if you do, you will see some of what Angell must have seen.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/books/review/Shulevitz-t.html

2010-11-19,The Zen of Silence,"John Cage was one astonishing individual. A composer we commonly associate with coin tossing, whose most famous piece called for the performer not to make a single sound, he upended long-held conventions about the listening process and prodded us to re-evaluate how we define not only music but the entire experience of encountering art. He was, in the words of Kenneth Silverman’s new biography, “driven by an ideal of nonmythic listening and seeing, of perceptual innocence”; his goal was to compose “a prelapsarian music untainted by history.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/books/review/Adams-t.html

(A few are forced: a June bug is ushered out of a bathroom in a tooth mug inverted on the ripped-off cover of “Seven Types of Ambiguity.”) Only wisps of the Hayseed books are shown directly, but occasional descriptions hint at what might have happened if Roald Dahl had invaded Narnia. The villain of the series, Mr. Toppit, is an unseen sinister force who sets cryptic tasks for its hero, Luke Hayseed, and is never satisfied.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/books/review/Willett-t.html

More than offering just a backward look, it helps explain the most troubling business headlines of the moment, as well as those that are certain to come. For starters, there is the unfolding foreclosure-paperwork fiasco. Next up will be a clash over whether big banks should be forced to take back billions of dollars in contaminated mortgages they sold. Down the road, we will no doubt confront the danger of the next asset bubble inflating as a result of the Federal Reserve’s use of extreme monetary policy to stimulate the economy.

Set against the Pierre’s rarefied setting, this didn’t feel like fashion for the masses so much as an exclusive collection narrowed down to its more tarty elements. It isn’t always clear exactly what brands dripping in luxury hope to get out of such dips into the more shallow end of the pool. But they clearly are getting something.

Like three egg rolls served to a party of four at a Chinese restaurant, the portions never seem to divide up quite as neatly as they should.

There were moms in tennis skirts, dads in pastels, good-looking blond boys who surfed and good-looking blond girls who were born to wear bikinis. We were the only dark-haired people they’d ever met who didn’t speak Spanish. When I left for college, I told myself that I’d never live in such a homogeneous place again.

Bush losing re-election after winning the Persian Gulf war of 1991, Bill Clinton in the 1994 midterms, and now Barack Obama.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/books/review/Meacham-t.html

2010-11-19,"It’s the Relationships, Stupid","THE director Edward Zwick has faced many challenges in his career. For his Civil War drama, “Glory,” he built an entire fort on a Savannah, Ga., beach and then laid siege to it. While shooting his domestic terrorism thriller, “The Siege,” he shut down the Brooklyn Bridge for an entire day. But these pale, perhaps, before the latest challenge he has set for himself: persuading men to shell out for a romantic comedy. That’s what people are calling “Love and Other Drugs,” even if the label is a loose fit. Adapted from Jamie Reidy’s best-selling memoir about the Viagra gold rush in the late 1990s, it stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a womanizing pharmaceutical representative who falls in lust, and then in love, with a beautiful young woman (Anne Hathaway) with Stage 1 Parkinson’s disease. It would be a plunge deep into disease-of-the-week territory, if not for the raunch — sex scenes, sex tapes, nudity, an orgy — that Mr. Zwick has seasoned the film with and that may leave some in the audience wondering whether they are watching a film about Viagra, or on Viagra.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/movies/21zwick.html

Ohio State has just one blemish on its record — a loss to Wisconsin — but it still has its eye on the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth. The Buckeyes will need to win out, starting Saturday at Iowa, and get some help from the Badgers, but the goal is still a realistic one. Virginia Tech — which began the season with two losses, including an embarrassing defeat at the hands of James Madison — has won eight in a row and has its sights set on the A.C.C. title. Miami would love to give the Hokies their first conference loss. Nebraska is kicking itself for the egg it laid against Texas. If not for that, the Cornhuskers would be in the middle of the race for the national title. As it is, they will travel to College Station on Saturday to take on Texas A&M, which has won four in a row. Neither Arkansas nor Mississippi State is going to win the SEC, but both teams have enjoyed successful seasons. A win over the Razorbacks would get the Bulldogs to eight victories in their second year under Coach Dan Mullen.

2010-11-22,Now Showing | Ann Agee,"“Ann Agee: Rules of the Pattern,” at the Locks Gallery in Philadelphia until Dec. 30, offers a look at recent work by the artist, who is known for her playful, subversive treatment of traditional decorative porcelain archetypes, like blue-and-white patterns (which she has applied to ceramic sex toys, or an entire bathroom) or 18th century figurines (which she re-imagines in contemporary clothing, doing things like carrying shopping bags). In this show, Agee continues to give domesticity her own spin, in hand-painted and stenciled, large-scale “wallpaper drawings” that depict idealized interiors, and which allude to models as diverse as 19th century scenic wallpaper, Matisse’s “The Dessert: Harmony in Red,” and the spaces depicted in Roy Lichtenstein’s paintings. Along with a display of intricate white porcelain vases, the exhibition includes three works that are groups of hand-made porcelain platters and bowls arranged on a steel armature. Traditional pieces like this are decorated with floral patterns or pastoral scenes, but Agee’s depict modest domestic interiors, including everyday items like washing machines and stoves.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/now-showing-ann-agee/

Physical labor, the researchers concluded, with its hours of lifting and moving heavy weights, had stunted the children’s growth. Somewhat improbably, from that scientific finding and other similar reports, as well as from anecdotes and accreting myth, many people came to believe “that children and adolescents should not” practice weight training, said Avery Faigenbaum, a professor of exercise science at the College of New Jersey. That idea retains a sturdy hold in the popular imagination. As a recent position paper on the topic of children and resistance training points out, many parents, coaches and pediatricians remain convinced that weight training by children will “result in short stature, epiphyseal plate” — or growth plate — “damage, lack of strength increases due to a lack of testosterone and a variety of safety issues.”",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/phys-ed-the-benefits-of-weight-training-for-kids/

The Rio State secretary of public security, José Mariano Beltrame, said the attacks were a retaliation by gang members for a government program to pacify violent slums, in part by installing a special community police force.

The exhibition opened last weekend, and while drinking wine in museum galleries is strictly prohibited, the design of the show brings wine into the galleries in other, ingenious ways. The museum’s architecture curator, Henry Urbach, collaborated on the installation with the New York architecture firm Diller Scofidio and Renfro, whose design for “The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life,” a 1998 exhibition at the Canadian Center for Architecture, convinced him that the architects would help bring something “as banal as fermented grapes” to life. For their part, the architects were intrigued by the idea of tackling a subject that’s not traditional museum fare. Elizabeth Diller, one of the firm’s partners, said, “Certain aspects of the story of wine’s transformation were more obvious — the branding of wineries with star architecture, design of stemware, labels, etc. — while it was less apparent how to present the experiential aspects of wine.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/seeing-things-more-wine/

The Big Ten and Big 12 South have plenty of meaningful football left to play, with Michigan State at Penn State, and Oklahoma at Oklahoma State headlining the action in their respective conferences. And will also be plenty of interest in games that involve ranked teams that don’t have a chance to win their conference (Louisiana State at Arkansas), in-state rivals (Florida at Florida State) and long-time foes who have seen better days (Notre Dame at Southern California).

More playful designs include the Vanité collection of skull charms ($477 and up), some with black diamond teeth accents, to the classic Serpent and Naja rings (starting at $550), featuring intricate scaling detailwork.

Not that she is opposed to the glamour. “It was an unconscious move for the line,” says the designer and new mom. “I think having a baby brought a youthfulness, freshness and versatility to the collection.” As she revisited the generations of inspirational women before her, photographs from the 1930s of her grandmother and friends vacationing along the Tigre River in Argentina resurfaced. “Their clothing were all the things I wanted: timeless, comfortable and pretty,” she says. The Voyage capsule collection, Azzaro’s latest diffusion line, is designed with comfort and a more carefree agenda in mind. It includes wrinkle-free materials like jerseys, knits and cashmere, introduced in sophisticated separates (think playsuits and pantsuits) and dresses, like a wrap model with embroidered cord detail. “The Azzaro woman is a woman that shows her femininity,” Seward says. “Nowadays women don’t have to be in a power suit to be in power.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/bon-voyage-a-new-line-from-azzaro/

The decision to halt the project was prompted by a report on the museum’s finances issued by Moody’s Investors Services last week. The report showed that while the museum retained its A2 investment rating, considered a good credit risk, on its $383 million in construction bonds, a negative rating was expected in the future should it be unable to maintain a certain degree of liquidity. Construction costs and a drop in private donations during the recession have both taken a toll. The museum is hoping to raise an additional $100 million in donations before continuing work. Under Phase 1 the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the BP Grand Entrance were opened in 2008 and the Resnick Exhibition Pavilion in September. The second phase will turn a former department store into new offices and galleries.

Childs Associates and BAML Capital Partners, the latest large leveraged buyout in which a company would pass from one private equity group to another. The deal values Advantage at about $1.8 billion, according to a person close to the deal who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly. Apax will acquire about 85 percent of the company, with Advantage’s existing management owning the rest. Advantage, based in Irvine, Calif., is a leading sales and marketing agency for consumer goods, working with clients like J. M. Smucker and Johnson & Johnson to maximize the value of their brands. The company has about $1 billion in annual revenue and is expected to generate about $180 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, according to this person.

The effort, which is expected to begin in February, will follow three previous attempts by the government, Air France and Airbus, the manufacturer of the plane, an A330-200. All 228 passengers and crew members were killed when Flight 447 went down in heavy thunderstorms while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009. The searches yielded more than 600 pieces of debris, but the flight recorders have not been found. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/world/europe/26briefs-Crash.html

The decision, which was released on Wednesday, ordered a new hearing by the Immigration and Refugee Board for the South African, Brandon Huntley. His initial success with the board was controversial in Canada, and the South African government filed a formal protest. The court acknowledged that violence and crime were widespread in South Africa, but it found that Mr. Huntley did not demonstrate that previous attacks against him were racially motivated.

2010-11-26,Letters: Lives,"I was deeply touched by Frederick Woolverton’s disclosure of being the ‘‘most-hated son’’ and having testified at his 10-year-old sister’s custody trial. He talked about the horrors of living with his alcoholic mother and the culture of fear that permeated the existence of his siblings. Until this reading I had not ever heard of another situation similar to my own. I testified at a custody trial at age 12 along with two other siblings, to choose which parent with which to spend the rest of my childhood. Fifty years later, we remain puzzled at the estrangements and disconnections from one another. This pivotal stage of court appearances changed much in our lives and ultimately, I believe, drove my brothers and sister and I apart. Not fully understanding why, I think Woolverton touched on issues that I can now reflect on, shake out and perhaps present to willing family members. Thanks to this article, my family might be willing to take another look at a time that we’ve all tried in our own ways to bury. Dianne Murphey Keystone Heights, Fl.I thank Frederick Woolverton for his Lives essay and The Times Magazine for publishing it. In a world with so much hurt and where many parent-child relationships are complicated by addiction, Woolverton is able to transcend his own past and be kind to his mother (and as a mental-health professional, help others with addiction). Although the author doesn’t believe that he forgives his mother, his treatment of her shows that at least part of him has forgiven — even if he will never forget.Betsy Garman Washington I was touched by Frederick Woolverton’s desire to reconcile with his elderly mother. Most of us understand his desire for closure, made more pressing by his mother’s age and frailty, though many would not share his ability to be so gracious in that situation. But it troubled me to read of his decision to visit his nursing-home-bound mother unannounced, since she ‘‘couldn’t communicate’’ and ‘‘could no longer refuse me.’’ The nursing-home culture change movement teaches us to respect individuals’ autonomy, however we feel about their choices. A broken relationship between mother and son is an extreme example of a choice; but it is, nonetheless, a choice. No matter her past behavior, Woolverton’s mother became the vulnerable one in their relationship. Rosa BaierProvidence, R.I.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/magazine/28letters-lives.html

As infectious-disease physicians, we respectfully disagree. Indeed, the overprescribing of antibiotics is disturbingly common, especially for respiratory infections of viral origin, which make up the vast majority of these “bronchial infections.” (Antibiotics do not work against viruses.) This overuse leads to antibiotic resistance, a dangerous and very real phenomenon. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has been trying for years to educate the public and physicians about the risks of misusing antibiotics. Antibiotics are a nonrenewable resource: for this reason and others, they are not available over-the-counter in our country. In many South American countries like Peru, antibiotics are available over-the-counter, contributing to widespread resistance in these countries. Doctors that prescribe antibiotics only when really indicated — “anti-antibiotics doctors,” in Cohen’s words — are actually the ones helping the most to keep these “wonder drugs” effective when they are really needed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/magazine/28Letters-t-THEETHICIST_LETTERS.html

Indeed, historically, Westerners of dubious character have had a knack for bluffing their ways to positions of prominence during times of strife. Consider Dravot’s real-life inspiration: Josiah Harlan, an American charlatan who in 1848 declared himself the prince of Ghor in central Afghanistan.

During prime-time on Thursday, however, network television drew meager ratings for mostly repeats and concert specials. Fox led the night by a slim margin, benefiting from an audience of more than 15 million viewers between 8 and 8:30 p.m. because of an overrun of its football coverage. Following it “The Simpsons Movie” averaged about five million viewers for Fox. CBS placed second over all with comedy repeats from 8 to 10 and a rerun of “The Mentalist” (7.6 million), which won the 10 p.m. hour ahead of “The Apprentice” on NBC (3.4 million) and the last hour of ABC’s special “Beyoncé’s I Am ...

DreamWorks Animation’s “Megamind” (distributed by Paramount) was third with $17.6 million for a new total of $130.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. “Burlesque,” a musical starring Cher and Christina Aguilera that Sony Pictures Entertainment backed with a hefty marketing campaign, was fourth with about $17 million. Denzel Washington’s runaway-train thriller, “Unstoppable” (20th Century Fox), took fifth place in its third week with about $16 million for a total of over $60 million. Opening out of the Top 5 were “Love & Other Drugs,” a romantic comedy from 20th Century Fox starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway that took in $14 million, and “Faster,” a thriller from CBS Films and Sony that had about $12 million in sales. “The King’s Speech,” a drama from the Weinstein Company that is considered an Oscar contender, opened in four theaters to $349,791, a total that is considered quite strong for such a limited release.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/movies/29arts-DISNEYSPINST_BRF.html

The institute aims to provide high-quality, dance-specific health care and dance science support services equal to those offered to elite athletes. “When you look at squash, football and rugby, if you apply the same definition of ‘injury’ to those other populations, dancers get injured much more, and we are just not doing enough, not just in this country but worldwide,” said Emma Redding, head of dance science at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. Dance UK, a dancer advocacy organization, will work with organizations including Trinity, the Birmingham Royal Ballet’s Jerwood Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Dance Injuries and the University of Wolverhampton to form a network that will collectively make up the institute. Its first project will be a two-year, real-time study of the health of working professional dancers. “This is significant,” Ms. Redding said, “because the only research that has ever been done on injuries has been retrospective.” Guy Dagger, the managing director of British Harlequin, said he hoped its donation would encourage other companies to contribute.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/arts/dance/29arts-DONATIONHELP_BRF.html

Even so, now at $100,000, it is one of the field’s richest. The winner this year is Louis Andriessen, 71, the Netherlands’ most prominent composer, the university said Sunday night. Mr. Andriessen won specifically for his multimedia opera “La Commedia,” which is based on Dante’s “Divine Comedy” and had its first performance in Amsterdam in 2008. The work was also performed last spring at Carnegie Hall, where Mr. Andriessen, left, was the subject of a series of concerts. The last five Grawemeyer winners in music were Gyorgy Kurtag, Sebastian Currier, Peter Lieberson, Brett Dean and York Höller. The awards are granted in four other areas: religion, education, political science and psychology. The Grawemeyer fund dropped to $17 million from about $29 million over six months in 2008 because of the stock market decline, said Allan Dittmer, the program’s executive director. “If we continued to give a $200,000 award, we would be deeply into our principal, which was dropping,” Mr. Dittmer said. “We had to do something.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/arts/music/29arts-DUTCHCOMPOSE_BRF.html

The owner, Sweetu Patel, knows a little something about timeless design after putting in five years on the floor of Cappellini, the SoHo Italian design emporium; for C.H.C.M. — which stands for Clinton Hill Classic Menswear —  he has carved a niche with classic American and European brands as well as hard-to-find Japanese ones. Last week, he brought those labels even closer within reach when he opened a fashionably minimalist, brick-and-mortar shop in NoHo.

The show’s maiden performances have drawn comment since the creators are still working on technical sequences; at the first preview the show had to stop five times to deal with glitches. That shaky performance came as some theater producers said that Foxwoods Theater, the landlord for “Spider-Man,” had inquired whether they had shows in the works that might be fits for the theater. Late on Monday the theater’s general manager, Erich Jungwirth, said in a statement that he had indeed talked to producers “to see if there are any shows coming up that may be able to play in our venue.” Such conversations are customary, Mr. Jungwirth said. The producers found the outreach unusual because it came when “Spider-Man” was already delaying its first preview by two weeks and involved a theater with a $65 million show that needs a multiyear run to turn a profit. A spokesman for the production, Rick Miramontez, also said late on Monday, “We are looking forward to ‘Spider-Man’ being at the Foxwoods Theater for years to come.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/theater/01arts-PRODUCERSAYS_BRF.html
