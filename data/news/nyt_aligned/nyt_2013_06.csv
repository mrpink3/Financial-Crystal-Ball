2013-06-03,Circumcision Device Approved by World Health Organization," A nonsurgical circumcision device that relies on a rubber band was approved by the World Health Organization on Friday, opening the way for its widespread use in Africa. The device, known as PrePex, is the only adult circumcision method, other than conventional surgery, to gain W.H.O. acceptance. Dr. Eric P. Goosby, the United States Global AIDS Coordinator, said that it would “truly help save lives” and that he was prepared to use funds from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for it. For a heterosexual man in countries where AIDS is common, being circumcised lowers the chance of getting infected by about 60 percent. In the past few years, the United States has paid for more than two million circumcisions in Africa; the W.H.O.’s goal is 20 million by 2015. PrePex can be quickly put in place by a two-nurse team. The foreskin dies from the pressure of the rubber band in a grooved ring, and drops off or is clipped off a week later. The procedure uses only topical anesthesia and is safer than surgery.

(HBO) TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE (2012) Clint Eastwood stars as Gus Lobel, a longtime scout for the Atlanta Braves whose eyesight is failing and whose job is threatened by a younger hotshot (Matthew Lillard) for whom baseball revolves around numbers and computers. But Gus has a secret weapon against the front-office man who would take him down with newfangled nonsense — and the washed-up pitcher (Justin Timberlake) sent by the Red Sox to check out a high school slugger (Joe Massingill): his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, above, with Mr. Eastwood), a lawyer whose eye for talent is almost as sharp as her gnarly dad’s used to be. “The pat and occasionally preposterous story is really just a pretext, a serviceable scaffolding for a handful of expert, satisfying performances,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Eastwood “has the good sense to realize that, much as we may adore him, we’d sometimes rather spend time with Ms. Adams, who somehow grows tougher, funnier, scarier and more charming with every role.” The film, Mr. Scott added, “may be an exhibition game, with nothing much at stake, but Ms. Adams brings the heat.

Germany, which has been deeply concerned about its rapidly dwindling population, released the results of its first census in nearly a quarter of a century on Friday and found 1.5 million fewer inhabitants than previously assumed. Chancellor Angela Merkel was already worried about the shrinking numbers of taxpayers and able-bodied workers. How future smaller generations will repay German debts, much less the mounting liabilities and guarantees meant to contain the euro-zone debt crisis, is a central question here. Germany had not conducted a single census count since reunification, not even an effort to tally those in the former East Germany after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The disappearance of 1.5 million people, equal to almost 1.9 percent of the population, only exacerbates the longer-term downward trend.

2013-06-03,What’s On Sunday,"8 P.M. (AMC) THE KILLING With the killer of Rosie Larsen finally revealed at the end of the second season, this series — which was canceled and then revived — returns with a new case, which the network says will be solved in a single year. And while Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos, above) is no longer working as a Seattle detective, she is drawn back into that life by her former partner Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman). During a search for a runaway girl, he discovers a string of gruesome murders seemingly connected to an investigation she headed several years earlier. Peter Sarsgaard joins the cast as Tom Seward, the psychopath who was convicted in those murders and is just weeks away from execution. Still, even with new colleagues, victims and suspects, “Season 3 looks an awful lot like the first two: brooding clouds; menacing, slate-colored skies; and leaden seas are still featured players,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “The creators take a fresh start but cling to the sepulchral atmospherics that too often take the place of narrative.

And some of the finer-heeled working mothers in London seem to feel the same. Last week I went with a friend to look at a potential new house where, on the second floor, there was a double reception room split by a central staircase. We instantly felt that the oversize space should become the master bedroom suite and devised the perfect boudoir floor plan on a napkin in Tom’s Deli after the viewing. The bath would go in the center of the room, opposite the fireplace. A folding screen would double as shelving for bath products on one side, and a bulletin board — covered in felt and trellised with ribbon — for the desk on the other side. It would also add an element of privacy, blocking the tub from the door that opens off the landing.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/letter-from-london-a-room-of-ones-own-with-a-tub/

To help guide less experienced bakers, Freeman includes names and definitions for the equipment (think microplanes, piping bags and thermocouples) involved in recreating her desserts, as well as the back story behind every creation. SFMOMA’s Janet Bishop provides the curator notes. There is, for example, the “Build Your Own Newman,” a construction of chocolate sables based on the Abstract Expressionist Barnett Newman’s sculpture “Zim Zum I.” For her part, Freeman was determined to photograph her cookie replica alongside the original art, in this case an eight-foot-tall steel structure in the museum’s sculpture garden.

2013-06-06,How Bad Is European Youth Unemployment?,"My Sunday column returned to what’s become a recurring theme of mine: The remarkable political quiescence of Europeans in the face of the economic devastation wrought by their rolling disaster of a currency union. In this case, my jumping-off point was what the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson calls “the scariest graph in the world,” which shows youth unemployment — for under-25-year-olds, that is — breaking 40 percent in Italy, 50 percent in Spain and 60 percent in Greece. So it’s worth saying something about the (fairly widespread) rejoinder that these numbers aren’t actually as bad as they look, because most young people are in school or training rather than looking fruitlessly for work. For instance, here’s the Financial Times’ Kate Allen, downplaying the youth-unemployment crisis:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/how-bad-is-european-youth-unemployment/

From there, you can make packing lists, sell things you never wear — for a 25 percent commission — and buy from other users, who include founding members like Charlotte Ronson, Irene Neuwirth and Julia Restoin Roitfeld.

Now, 60 years later, there is an answer to the question everyone — or at least one or two people — has been asking ever since: where can I get those chic reindeer boots? The answer is Bally, the Swiss company that in the ’40s began custom-making boots for serious mountaineers, among them the pair that Tenzing wore for his storied ascent. In honor of the anniversary of that climb — and the fact that the old-fashioned mountaineer has become a style model in men’s fashion — Bally is issuing a new version of the boots. The sole is lighter in weight and they lace more easily. But like the originals, they are available only by order, and they are still made of reindeer fur.

What we’ve come to realize in compiling the Gun Report each day is that more and more people feel completely justified to use a gun to settle an argument, to shoot first and ask questions later—even when the person who is killed is a drunk 16-year-old who accidentally climbs through a neighbor’s window instead of his own—and to “defend” themselves even when no defense is required. Stand Your Gun laws—as well as concealed carry laws, and laws that allow people to brandish weapons in public—are laws that provoke gun violence rather than prevent it, and help return us to the ethos of the wild west, where guns were the court of first resort.

That’s how I made these pork chops, with their lusty Neapolitan topping to accompany a sturdy aglianico. The slow cooking gently brings the meat to tenderness, guarding its juices. It also grants the cook nearly an hour to assemble the rest of the dinner, and what does the grill master know about that? (You might consider moving the meat away from the fire and covering the grill, but the temperature will not be as consistent and will require monitoring.)

A story of resilience (human and genre), it pivots on a prisoner turned running man, Franck (Albert Dupontel), who races through an obstacle course swarming with cruel inmates, corrupt guards, man-hunting cops and a woman-stalking serial killer. Short on words if rarely breath, Franck runs to save his family, his cash and an ever-more outrageous movie that shouldn’t work yet does.

According to Reuters, the movie’s director, Shawn Levy, said Mr. Vaughn hit on the story idea after watching a report on “60 Minutes” that anointed Google as one of the best places in the world to work. Thus inspired, maybe because he himself works in Hollywood, Mr. Vaughn reached out to the company, which cooperated with the production because executives were said to feel that they didn’t have much choice but to agree to hours of Google adoration.

2013-06-07,The Other Sister,"To experience this novel exactly as the author intended, a reader should avoid the flap copy and everything else written about it. Including this review. The last writers to be unscathed by spoilers were probably the Victorians, who pounded out the likes of “Great Expectations” in weekly, serialized installments. No reviewer could blow the surprise of a convict benefactor or Miss Havisham’s cobwebby cake when these were yet unwritten. But in modern times, literary fiction presents a conundrum: The more craftily constructed its suspense, the more it tempts its advocates — in the interest of airtime — to reach into a serious tale and pull out something resembling a tabloid headline. Such as: “Girl and Chimp Twinned at Birth in Psychological Experiment.” That’s the big reveal in Karen Joy Fowler’s “We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves,” a novel so readably juicy and surreptitiously smart, it deserves all the attention it can get.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/karen-joy-fowlers-we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves.html

On Tuesday, soldiers, acting on a tip, raided a house in Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, 30 miles from McAllen, Tex. They found the migrants and detained a man who had been acting as a lookout.

2013-06-07,What’s On Friday,"1 A.M. (Showtime 2) TAKE THIS WALTZ (2012) Margot, a young wife (Michelle Williams, above) in Toronto, finds herself attracted to a stranger (Luke Kirby) on a trip to Nova Scotia and is dismayed to discover, after sitting together on the flight home and sharing a cab from the airport, that he lives across the street from the charming row house she shares with her husband (Seth Rogen). She doesn’t want to give up her infatuation with her handsome neighbor. But she also does not want to destroy her marriage. He merely lets her know that he is interested and available should she change her mind. That ambivalence is central to what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called “Sarah Polley’s honest, sure-footed, emotionally generous second feature,” which he chose as a critics’ pick. “Ms. Williams, one of the bravest and smartest actresses working in movies today, portrays a young woman who is indecisive and confused, but never passive,” he said. “Margot’s uncertainty, as she and Ms. Polley understand it, is a kind of passion in its own right. The current of her desire runs strongly in two directions: toward the man she knows and loves, and toward the stranger she wants in ways beyond her immediate understanding.” He added: “There is a moment about 90 minutes in that I was sure was the end, and I still think that stopping there would have made ‘Take This Waltz’ perfect. But I’m also willing to grant that perfection may not have been Ms. Polley’s chief concern, especially since the great theme of this wonderful movie — a source of delight as well as distress — is that imperfection is all anyone ever learns from love.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

The differences in their lives notwithstanding, Brockes writes in her new book, “it didn’t occur to me until an absurdly late stage that we might, in fact, be separate people.” Paula deflected questions about her previous life, which enabled Brockes to maintain that illusion. “If it struck me as odd that we never saw or heard from” her mother’s brothers and sisters, Brockes writes, “I didn’t dwell on it. Like most children, the life my parents led before I was born was a rumor I didn’t believe in.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/she-left-me-the-gun-by-emma-brockes.html

2013-06-10,The Myth of ‘Just Do It’,"Yogi Berra, the former Major League baseball catcher and coach, once remarked that you can’t hit and think at the same time. Of course, since he also reportedly said, “I really didn’t say everything I said,” it is not clear we should take his statements at face value. Nonetheless, a widespread view — in both academic journals and the popular press — is that thinking about what you are doing, as you are doing it, interferes with performance. The idea is that once you have developed the ability to play an arpeggio on the piano, putt a golf ball or parallel park, attention to what you are doing leads to inaccuracies, blunders and sometimes even utter paralysis. As the great choreographer George Balanchine would say to his dancers, “Don’t think, dear; just do.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/the-myth-of-just-do-it/

2013-06-11,A New York Perfumer Finds an Unlikely Source of Inspiration,"This Saturday, a little over a year after introducing its namesake signature fragrance — a combination of rhubarb and Madagascar vetiver — the Greenwich Village boutique-turned-perfumer Aedes de Venustas will release its much-anticipated follow-up. Teaming up this time with the German perfumer Ralf Schwieger, whose clients include the likes of Frédéric Malle and Hermès, the brand’s co-owners Karl Bradl and Robert Gerstner attempted to capture the essence of a rare flower to create the unisex aroma Iris Nazarena. “The inspiration was an iris that grows only in the mountains of Nazareth,” said Bradl, who discovered the species through art on a postcard. “It is a protected wildflower, so we could not harvest or remove the flower.” What’s more, iris flowers don’t actually have a scent — typically, only their roots do — so the team had to get creative. The fragrance they created, according to Bradl, is inspired by the “color, texture and pattern of the blossom.” The result is decidedly not floral. Instead, the eau de parfum has a powdery quality, with musky hints of clove and star anise, evoking burning incense — a signature note in the olfactory repertory of Aedes de Venustas, whose house line includes a scented room spray and candles. The effect is like a visit to an officers’ club from a bygone era, all smoky wood, aged leather and classic men’s cologne.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/t-magazine/new-york-perfumer-aedes-de-venustas.html

2013-06-11,What’s on Tuesday,"1 P.M. (Sundance) L’AMOUR FOU (2011) The French couturier Yves Saint Laurent, below, may have been surrounded by intense beauty, both in the atelier and at home, yet he was said to be joyful only twice a year: on the days a new collection was shown, usually to boisterous acclaim. But within 24 hours, the euphoria had evaporated. Pierre Bergé narrates this documentary about Saint Laurent, his partner in business and in life for a half-century until the designer’s death in 2008. The “crazy love” of the title refers not so much to their relationship but to Saint Laurent’s obsessions with objects, from the artworks — including Picassos, Matisses, Braques and a treasured Brancusi that were sold at a 2009 Christie’s auction — to the perfect houses, which he collected passionately. (All of the rooms in one were named after characters from Proust.) “Much of this stately, rather detached biography,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this documentary from Pierre Thoretton, “is pornography for the eye (not the body).” Of Saint Laurent’s depression, he added, “To realize that you may have the world while still feeling as if you have nothing is to experience a closer encounter with the void than most of us are likely to have.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

Mr. Richard has denied wrongdoing. He is being investigated on suspicion of organized fraud, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Investigators are examining a 2008 arbitration case in which Bernard Tapie, a businessman, was awarded $535 million to settle a dispute with Crédit Lyonnais, a state-owned bank. Mr. Tapie had been a career Socialist, but he switched his allegiance in 2007 to the center-right party led by the president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy. Acting on a complaint from Socialist deputies, prosecutors began an investigation to learn if Mr. Tapie might have received special treatment in the case, which Mr. Tapie denied. They are also trying to understand why government officials did not challenge the outcome despite indications of possible anomalies in the procedure. At the time of the arbitration, Mr. Richard was chief of staff to Ms. Lagarde, who was Mr. Sarkozy’s finance minister from 2007 to 2011. Ms. Lagarde has herself come under suspicion for allowing the arbitration. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/world/europe/chief-executive-linked-to-imf-official-faces-inquiry.html

No one is sure, according to Daniel Bergner. When it comes to the study of female sexuality, scientists have tended to see what they expect, or want, to see, and there are fewer established facts than you would think. “Despite all the powers of contemporary science,” Bergner writes, “the seemingly straightforward anatomical question, is there a G spot? remains unanswered.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/books/review/what-do-women-want-by-daniel-bergner.html

2013-06-14,Can a Juror Ever Fudge the Truth?," About 15 years ago, while living in St. Louis, I was summoned for jury duty. The defendant was charged with two counts of murder. During jury selection, I was asked if I supported the death penalty. I don’t. I’m unalterably opposed to capital punishment. But I feared that potential jurors who did not support the death penalty could be automatically disqualified by the prosecution. So I said I agreed with capital punishment. That way, if it came down to it, I might help spare the defendant from execution. But this violated the oath I had taken to tell the truth. Was it ethical for me to lie in order to possibly spare the life of this defendant? NAME WITHHELD",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/can-a-juror-ever-fudge-the-truth.html
2013-06-14,I Was Too Clever to Quit Smoking,"One central paradox of the smoker’s life is that, despite swallowing an almost comically flagrant deception, most smokers like to regard themselves as pretty smart people. Step outside any bar or restaurant, nip around the back of a conference room at coffee time, and you’ll see them: a bitter huddle of smarter-than-thou smokers, shooting down society’s sacred cows. Want to know how many people died while exercising last year? Ask a smoker. Think smoking kills you? Think again. Every smoker you meet will tell you about their Aunt Jenny or Uncle Steve who sucked back 90 a day and lived to be 100, and even then died only because their houses fell on them.

In the following two years, that number doubled. Today, the total is more than two thousand, and each day seems to bring news of more. Yet the tactic has not lost its power to shock and horrify. There has been a steady proliferation of efforts to make sense of it, not just among academics and policy wonks, but by novelists, filmmakers and artists the world over.

Maybe that’s me projecting adult emotions on a 5-year-old, but no other superhero or franchise sticks like Spider-Man: T-shirts, boxers, sweatshirts, her favorite shoes, her favorite drinking glass, her favorite car, her favorite puzzle, the action figures on her night stand that she rearranges before bedtime, her pajamas.",Style,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/daughter-to-dad-girlie-pajamas-please/

In the artist’s case, she picked cotton on Hidden Hill (which has been renamed Little Eva Plantation) and then, when her family moved, at Melrose Plantation. It was there that, in her 50s, Clementine Hunter picked up a paintbrush and embarked on what became a remarkable career.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/travel/looking-for-clementine-hunters-louisiana.html

2013-06-17,What’s on Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) In this final installment in the director Christopher Nolan’s trilogy, Christian Bale stars as Batman, who has now retreated into the shadows — and his playboy alter ego, Bruce Wayne, who has gone into seclusion at Wayne Manor — years after the death of his foe Harvey Dent and the woman both men loved. Now Bane (Tom Hardy, above left, with Mr. Bales), an overmuscled brute who wears a mask that supplies him with a pain-relieving gas, is intent on destroying Gotham City. Bruce must also contend with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar in search of a clean slate. Gary Oldman is back as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Caine as Alfred, the Wayne family butler. “After repeatedly sending Batman down Gotham’s mean streets, Mr. Nolan ends by taking him somewhere new,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critic’s pick. “That’s precisely the point of a late sequence in which he shifts between a multitude of characters and as many locations without losing you, his narrative thread or momentum.” Like the scenes-within-scenes from his last movie, “Inception,” she said, “the controlled fragmentation works on a pleasurable, purely cinematic level.” But, Ms. Dargis added, “it also serves Mr. Nolan’s larger meaning in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and becomes his final say on superheroes and their uses because, as Gotham rages and all seems lost, the action shifts from a lone figure to a group, and hope springs not from one but many.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

(13) INSPECTOR LEWIS, SERIES VI: DOWN AMONG THE FEARFUL A new round of this show, a “Masterpiece Mystery!” stalwart, begins as Inspector Lewis, the long-suffering detective played by Kevin Whately — in what may be his final season as he embarks on a sabbatical — and his sidekick, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway (Laurence Fox, above center, with Mr. Whately, right, and Sanjeev Bhaskar), investigate the murder of a psychic who is an Oxford psychology fellow. Rebecca Front reprises her role as their boss, Chief Superintendent Innocent, and Clare Holman is the winsome pathologist Laura Hobson, whose languorous courtship with Lewis the show promises to resolve. “Knowing that this might be the last hurrah, the writers and directors have given these episodes a valedictory quality that edges up to but doesn’t cross the line of mawkishness; the final, silent fade-out is both moving and appropriately modest,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “And Lewis is always Lewis. In the first episode of ‘Inspector Morse,’ he begged off a trip to the pub with his alcoholic boss because it was his night with the kids. As ‘Inspector Lewis’ comes to a close, he’s ready to give up the whole grind to spend more time with them. You never really believe it when American TV cops say that, but after a quarter-century, we can trust Lewis.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

But the rapper Stefan Burnett and the keyboardist Andy Morin pulled it off impressively on their own and with samples. Mr. Burnett has the rampaging intensity of an early punk singer — he seems as if he’s inventing new ways to make music challenge and disobey — and the voice of a drill sergeant; he never let up, barking and chanting short, dark and dense lines, rocking back and forth from the waist.

2013-06-17,"As Rape Reports Increase in Delhi, a Call for Uncommon Men and Women","Last December, a young woman we call “Nirbhaya” was so brutally assaulted and raped by six men on a bus that she died from her injuries two weeks later. She was barely older than my daughter Mira. Grieving, I looked for solace in student memories. I had resisted going to a women’s college at Delhi University, but a few years later at Mount Holyoke, a college for women in Massachusetts, I discovered a world where no one had to remind you to “lean in” because every woman already had her shoulder to the wheel and was moving the needle on everything from microbiology to challenging history with herstory. I was surrounded by women who wrote poetry, discussed politics, dismantled engines, designed buildings, managed newspapers, and danced for the joy of being able to do so. It was a world where women were not less than but equal to – a world, as the playwright Wendy Wasserstein put it, of “Uncommon Women.”The assault happened in New Delhi – the city of my birth and the city where I now live. It is comforting for many to believe that cultures of rape arise in war-torn places like the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now suddenly it was New Delhi that was labeled the “capital of rape.” The latest statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau indicate that a woman is raped in India every 20 minutes and that this horrendous statistic could well be worse because of high levels of underreporting. According to the N.C.R.B., the number of crimes against women reported to the Indian police has increased from 228, 650 in 2011 to 244,270 in 2012. Out of the 24,923 rape cases registered by the police across India in 2012, 706 cases of rape were reported in Delhi, according to the N.C.R.B. In 2011 the number of rape cases reported in Delhi was 572. ",World,https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/as-rape-reports-increase-in-delhi-a-call-for-uncommon-men-and-women/

The decision followed an investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the academy said in a statement Monday. The exact number of football players who will face the proceedings has not yet been released, but officials previously said three players were under investigation. The investigation was dropped last year before it was reopened early in 2013. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/maryland-rape-inquiry-at-naval-academy-advances.html
2013-06-18,Maryland: Manning Trial Looks at Address Disclosures,"Prosecutors laid the groundwork on Monday for trying to prove that Pfc.

As Private Manning’s trial at Fort Meade entered its third week, witnesses described how an individual could gain access to the internal directory of contact information for military personnel and how enemies could use that list against the United States. Defense lawyers countered that downloading the e-mail addresses of fellow military personnel was not against the rules. Evidence indicating that Private Manning released the e-mail addresses could damage his image as a good-intentioned whistle-blower who carefully selected which documents to release.

2013-06-18,What’s on Tuesday,"6 P.M. (Cinemax) SAFE HOUSE (2012) Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington, above), a rogue superspy formerly with the Central Intelligence Agency and called “the black Dorian Gray,” is held for debriefing in a Cape Town safe house by an untested rookie, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), after dodging a gun-toting gang and slipping into the American Embassy in this thriller about the very bad things that operatives sometimes do in the name of country and company. Despite cutting among as many as four action scenes at a time, the director, Daniel Espinosa, “maintains a visually coherent, narratively rational sense of time and space, no matter how fast the story shifts about, which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house, slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Safe House’ is essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

After introducing me to his star brush maker, Fermin Gil, a Mexican immigrant who “can just see” when a brush isn’t right, Kirschner handed me a one-inch boar-bristle brush with a wooden handle. A Chinese manufacturer sells it for 30 cents. If he made it himself, he told me, it would cost significantly more.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/what-paintbrush-makers-know-about-how-to-beat-china.html

Since independence in 1947, life expectancy at birth has more than doubled, to 66 years from 32, and per-capita income (adjusted for inflation) has grown fivefold. In recent decades, reforms pushed up the country’s once sluggish growth rate to around 8 percent per year, before it fell back a couple of percentage points over the last two years. For years, India’s economic growth rate ranked second among the world’s large economies, after China, which it has consistently trailed by at least one percentage point.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/why-india-trails-china.html

In Washington, the Treasury Department sharply criticized the British ruling and warned that Bank Mellat, which has been accused of financing Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile activities, remained under sanction by both the European Union and the United States.

Ms. Munro, 81, had just accepted the Trillium Book Award for her latest collection, “Dear Life,” when she told Mark Medley, an editor from The National Post: “I’m probably not going to write anymore. And, so, it’s nice to go out with a bang.” Asked if “you really think this is it for you,” she responded, “Oh yes.” Told that her fans would be disappointed, she said: “Well, tell them to go read the old ones over again. There’s lots of them.” Ms. Munro, an Ontario native who is considered a master of the short story, won the Man Booker International Prize in 2009. In her review of “Dear Life” in The New York Times in December, Michiko Kakutani wrote that Ms. Munro “creates tales that have the scope and amplitude of novels: whole lives are condensed into a handful of pages, the progress of love is charted over the years as passion gives way to restlessness or deeper commitment or something more ambiguous.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/books/alice-munro-says-she-is-retiring.html

They are a mixed lot on Sal Mal Lane: Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers, descendants of European colonizers.

2013-06-21,The Beloved Country,"In 1992, when the mujahedeen arrived in Kabul, young Qais Akbar Omar “expected to see heroes in uniforms and shiny boots.” Instead, the Holy Warriors had “beards, mustaches and smelly shoes that wrapped up stinky feet.” Omar’s father and grandfather were hopeful, but the liberation was short-lived. Soon, fighting broke out across the city. “It was like when a forest catches fire,” Omar writes; “both the dry and the wet burn.” The family retreated to their basement before the onslaught of rockets and snipers forced them to abandon their home altogether. Piling into their Volga, Omar and his mother, father, three sisters, baby brother, two aunts and seven cousins set out for safer ground.

2013-06-21,Natural Lawyer,"Most of us live our partisan politics through the media, which generally means cross-firing tweets, posts and cable news shows about the latest scandal as interpreted by a rotating stable of Washington strategists, party faithfuls and pundits. But behind the klieg lights, there has always been a less topical, more abstract debate between liberal and conservative academics and philosophers about the nature of human flourishing and the political and social institutions that best promote it.

2013-06-21,Bless the Borrowers,"Robert Kuttner’s title refers, first, to the “medieval institution” that was the fate of improvident souls in England who could not repay their debts, including Daniel Defoe. In 1692, Defoe was committed to King’s Bench Prison in London, where he began to agitate for a change in the legal system. Forcing debtors to rot, Defoe not disinterestedly pointed out, was injurious to both parties, since “after a debtor was confined in prison both he and the creditor lost through his prolonged distress.” Society responded, eventually, with bankruptcy laws, but it is very much Kuttner’s point in “Debtors’ Prison” that we — America and Europe in the age of the financial crisis — have yet to absorb the principal lesson of Defoe’s “bitter experience.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/books/review/debtors-prison-by-robert-kuttner.html
2013-06-21,When Two Paths Meet,"Deploying flatulence as a plot device takes nerve. Chaucer got away with it in “The Miller’s Tale,” thanks to the bawdy, rowdy nature of the story. In her ambitious new novel, “Questions of Travel,” the Sri Lankan-Australian novelist Michelle de Kretser gets away with it too, when her main characters, Ravi and Laura, finally have an encounter that seems like a prelude to some greater connection — or at least a reckoning or revelation. But the moment passes with Ravi’s gas. This willful non-event is the culmination of de Kretser’s cool play with conventional reader expectations about how much, and how meaningfully, two disparate lives should matter to each other when they finally converge after pages and pages of parallel-track narratives.

2013-06-21,Illiberal Arts,"More than a century ago, the president of Harvard, A. Lawrence Lowell, issued a warning to America’s colleges and universities. “Institutions,” he said, “are rarely murdered. They meet their end by suicide. . . . They die because they have outlived their usefulness, or fail to do the work that the world wants done.” Most of the institutions he had in mind are still around today, but the doomsday talk is back. William J. Bennett, secretary of education under President Reagan, and Jeffrey Selingo, an editor at The Chronicle of Higher Education, believe our system is self-­destructing. Their tones are different — Bennett and his co-author, David Wilezol, write in an expectant mood of good riddance, while Selingo is sympathetically alarmed — but their views are grimly consistent.

The perennial prankster has continued to produce imagery via Toilet Paper, the salacious biannual he creates with the commercial photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari. Since its inaugural issue in 2010, the magazine has regularly published 2-D works with the same eccentric qualities as Cattelan’s sculptures. (An anthology was released last year.) Its spreads are scabrous and surreal, cartoonish and sublime: an eyeball staring from a man’s mouth, a playing card held between a woman’s buttocks, a half-eaten bar of soap. Though much of the work will elicit laughter, Cattelan and Ferrari take it very seriously. “Toilet Paper images are the realization of everyone’s most intimate, hidden and unspeakable desires and urges,” Cattelan said. “What makes a Toilet Paper image is the attempt to say something terrible while staying quiet.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/on-view-maurizio-cattelans-shocking-window-displays-at-the-palais-de-tokyo/

2013-06-24,What’s on Saturday,"9 P.M. (Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and ’60s by Woody Allen, a retired, and overly psychoanalyzed, music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to an earnest lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penélope Cruz, above with Alessandro Tiberi) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) blown to smithereens when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) shows up for a visit. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect — a ghost? a specter of the younger man’s self? — who witnesses the ordeal. “One of the most delightful things about ‘To Rome With Love’ is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The limitations of ‘To Rome With Love,’ as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights. Some of the scenes feel rushed and haphazardly constructed, and the dialogue frequently sounds overwritten and under-rehearsed. But this may just be to say that we are watching late-period Woody Allen. Complaining would be as superfluous — though also, perhaps, as inevitable — as psychoanalysis.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The agreement was technically designed to allow peaceful nuclear cooperation with India despite its status then as a nonproliferation pariah, but the real purpose, as one architect of the accord put it, was to “forge the strategic partnership based on common values that had eluded both countries for many decades” and demonstrate how valuable Washington “deemed the U.S.-Indian partnership to be in meeting U.S. grand strategic objectives.”It was an act of faith: two big, diverse, sometimes exasperating democracies, the United States and India would surely find a way to do wonderful things together.

2013-06-24,What’s on Sunday,"10 P.M. (Lifetime) DEVIOUS MAIDS Subtitle this new series, which counts Eva Longoria among its executive producers, “Desperate Housekeepers.” Five maids bound by their personal struggles navigate the upstairs-downstairs attitudes of their Beverly Hills employers in this take on the telenovela “Ellas Son ... la Alegría del Hogar.” The story begins as one of their peers, Flora (Paula Garcés), is murdered in the home where she works during one of the year’s fanciest society events. Marisol, played by Ana Ortiz, works for some troubled newlyweds and tries to learn the truth about Flora’s death. Dania Ramírez is Rosie, who left her son in Mexico to work as a maid and nanny for a couple of uppity actors. Roselyn Sánchez is Carmen, an aspiring singer who would like her pop-star employer to help jump-start her career. And Zoila (Judy Reyes) and her teenage daughter (Edy Ganem, above right with, from left, Ms. Sánchez, Ms. Ramírez and Ms. Reyes) are the maids for an emotionally unstable but very wealthy woman. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said that despite amusing touches, the show is “relentlessly arch and tongue in cheek in a way that seemed fresh when ‘Desperate Housewives’ began in 2004, but now is less so.” She added: “There is more to these hard-working women than their laundry skills — they are called devious for a reason — but the story lines and dialogue may be a bit too cute and contrived to hold viewers’ interest for long.” It’s the cast, she said, “that commands attention.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/arts/whats-on-sunday.html

I’m not one for adding fruits like blueberries and cranberries to salads, but I found that I liked this combination a lot.

2013-06-24,Dead-enders in Dark Suits,"The Bank for International Settlements is the central bankers’ central bank; accordingly, it tends to exhibit the prejudices of the tribe in especially concentrated form. In particular, it has been relentless in making the case for higher interest rates, on the grounds that … well, the logic keeps changing. For a while it was warning about inflation and commodity prices; when the inflation failed to materialize and commodity prices slumped again, it simply changed the argument to one against bubbles, plus the quite amazing argument that central bankers must not keep rates low because that would take the fiscal pressure off governments.

2013-06-24,"Florida Versus Spain, An Update","I’ve suggested on a number of occasions that one good way to understand the problems of the euro is to compare the experiences of Florida and Spain. Both had huge housing bubbles, fed in part by buyers of coastal holiday homes, which burst. Both suffered nasty recessions as a result. But then their destinies diverged, because one was part of a fiscal as well as monetary union, while the other wasn’t. As its economy shrank, Florida paid much less in federal taxes, even as federal spending in Florida rose; I’ve estimated the de facto federal aid to Florida in 2010 at around 5 percent of GDP. That’s aid, not loans; anything on that scale would have been inconceivable in Europe.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/florida-versus-spain-an-update/

Rare is the computer screen that doesn’t have a couple stuck along its edges. Other items, like scissors, have been around for centuries. The rubber band was patented in 1845. The modern staple and staple remover came along in the 1930s. In this second installment of the “Office Romance” series on the 6th Floor Blog, I look for beauty in these objects.

The killings made headlines in Britain and France in September 2012. The man who was arrested, Zaid al-Hilli, the brother and son of two of the victims of the killings near the French-Swiss border, has repeatedly denied published reports in Britain that he was involved in a multimillion inheritance dispute with Saad al-Hilli, his younger brother, who died in the killings along with his mother and his wife. Two of the younger Mr. Hilli’s children, both young girls, survived the shooting, one of them with a fractured skull and a bullet wound to her shoulder. The Surrey police said that in arresting the older Mr. Hilli they had acted at the request of the French police, who had questions about Mr. Hilli’s whereabouts at the time of the killing and the origins of the disputed inheritance. The French police have said that their inquiries have centered on a family dispute over money originally transferred to British and Swiss banks — and properties in Britain bought with the funds — during the years when Saddam Hussein ruled in Iraq.

(TMC) SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998) Joseph Fiennes portrays Shakespeare as a struggling playwright cursed with the double whammy of writer’s block and a crisis of sexual confidence, and Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola, the literate, headstrong muse who inspires him to write “Romeo and Juliet” in this Oscar-winning film from the director John Madden. “Ingenious as the film’s many inventions happen to be (from boatmen who behave like cabbies to its equivalent of Shakespearean outtakes — ‘One Gentleman of Verona’ in the writing process), it could never have had so much energy without the right real-life Juliet to dazzle Will,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Paltrow, “in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright’s guiding light. In a film steamy enough to start a sonnet craze, her Viola De Lesseps really does seem to warrant the most timeless love poems, and to speak Shakespeare’s own elegant language with astonishing ease. ‘Shakespeare in Love’ itself seems as smitten with her as the poet is, and as alight with the same love of language and beauty.” Ms. Paltrow won an Oscar for best actress; Judi Dench (above, with Colin Firth as Viola’s fiancé) for best supporting actress for her role as Queen Elizabeth; Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for best screenplay; and the film for best picture.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

2013-06-25,"The Gun Report: June 25, 2013","The opening statements in the George Zimmerman trial are over; the case is finally under way. Was Zimmerman a vigilante who took advantage of Florida’s absurd “Stand Your Ground” law to shoot a young, innocent black boy for the crime of wearing a hoodie? Or was he someone who was genuinely threatened—by an unarmed 17-year-old!—and fired his gun in self-defense? Here at the Gun Report, we are rather skeptical of the defense, but notwithstanding that, the larger problem here is that laws like Stand Your Ground practically encourage vigilantism, and a Wild West mentality. The reader comments from the pro-gun advocates in this forum often stress the gun violence committed by out-and-out criminals, but what has been striking to us since we began compiling this report a month after the Newtown massacre is how many deaths are not the result of criminals bearing arms—how many are accidents, or shots fired in anger, or, on occasion, George Zimmerman-style examples of vigilantism.

2013-06-26,Lebanon: Bank Settles Case With U.S.," Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday that a Lebanese bank linked to what they described as a vast money-laundering operation by Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese Shiite organization, had agreed to a $102 million settlement. The settlement will come from $150 million impounded by the Justice Department last August from the bank, the Lebanese Canadian Bank, which is now in liquidation. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that the settlement “shows that banks laundering money for terrorists and narco-traffickers will face consequences for their actions, wherever they may be located.” A federal lawsuit filed in 2011 placed the bank at the center of what prosecutors and drug enforcement officials said was a scheme in which it laundered the proceeds from sales of Colombian narcotics and used cars that were exported from the United States. The lawsuit said the bank then repatriated the laundered money to Lebanon, where Hezbollah received a portion. Hezbollah dismissed the lawsuit as propaganda.

2013-06-26,The Suicide Detective,"For reasons that have eluded people forever, many of us seem bent on our own destruction. Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century — the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies — nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/the-suicide-detective.html

2013-06-26,After Hours | Young Jean Lee’s Goofy Pop Existentialism,"Last night at Chez André in the basement of the Standard Hotel, East Village, as part of its Standard Sounds series, the stage was occupied by the 39-year-old Korean-American writer and performer Young Jean Lee, whom The Times, in a review last year of her “Untitled Feminist Play,” called “the most adventurous downtown playwright of her generation.” Hopping up and down in a T-shirt, colorful print pants, Converse low-tops and a chronic goofy smile, Lee looked like that beloved friend from college: funny, nice, smart, a bit dorky. So it was a surprise to hear her sing — in her clear but unremarkable voice, and accompanied by the moody synth-pop riffs of her band, the scruffy hipster quartet Future Wife — such unforgiving lyrics as: “When you get old, you will lose your mind and everything will hurt all the time.” Or the finale: “I’m gonna die. I’m gonna die someday. Then I’ll be gone. And it’ll be O.K.” Such is the shruggingly morbid nature of “We’re Gonna Die,” the song cycle Lee penned, after the illness and death of her father, on the horrific but ultimately it-is-what-it-is nature of mortality. She has been performing the cycle for a few years now and will bring it back to Lincoln Center Theater from Aug. 5 through Aug. 17.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/after-hours-young-jean-lees-goofy-pop-existentialism/

Koerner, documents a time in the late 1960s and early ’70s when hijacking was an alarmingly regular part of traveling the American skies. Mr. Koerner devotes most of his attention to Roger Holder, a disgruntled Vietnam vet, and Cathy Kerkow, a troubled young woman from Oregon. The pair, who hijacked a flight and took it to Algiers, eventually settled in France, where they became minor celebrities among the French left. Reviewing the book for The Times, Dwight Garner called it “such pure pop storytelling that reading it is like hearing the best song of summer squirt out of the radio.” In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Koerner discussed interviewing Holder, why it took so long for the authorities to increase airport security at the time and more.

Evans and Lawrence v. Texas stands on the question of gay marriage, you can make a strong case that same-sex marriage opponents should actually be breathing a sigh of relief at today’s rulings on the issue. For now, the right to define marriage is still reserved to the states, which means that the political battle can continue — albeit amid a flood of new lawsuits inspired by some of Kennedy’s arguments — in jurisdictions where the national trend toward support for gay wedlock hasn’t yet overwhelmed the traditional view. This obviously matters to the hardy band of activists who still hold out hope of reversing that trend. But it also matters to the many social conservatives who assume that gay marriage’s continued advance is more or less inevitable, but who hope to build in as many protections for religious liberty as possible along the way.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/religious-liberty-and-the-gay-marriage-endgame/

2013-06-27,Listen Up | The Moody Tunes of Dirty Beaches,"“How you live your life eventually influences what you create,” said Alex Zhang Hungtai, better known by his moniker, Dirty Beaches. If that’s true, then Hungtai, who looks like a hipster Wong Kar-Wai character, has a lot of experiences to draw from for his music. Hungtai was born in Taiwan but has lived and worked in such diverse places as Montreal, Queens and Berlin, where the video for “I Dream in Neon” — featured exclusively above — was shot. It’s a moody, lo-fi single from his most recent album, “Drifters/Love Is the Devil,” on which many of the tracks are deliciously experimental and seem like they span decades, tiptoeing a thin line between a late ’60s garage band and a New Age ’80s pop group. “The album, and song, is a conglomeration of all of the past work I’ve done. I want people to come along for the ride,” he said. The music video, which he referred to as the loosely autobiographical story of his move to Germany, where he made part of this record, cuts in and out of shots of dimly lit classic cars zipping around foreboding streets. One might expect Ryan Gosling to pop out of the shadows at any moment — not a coincidence since Hungtai is “definitely obsessed” with the 2011 sleeper hit “Drive.” “I must have seen it about four times in theaters,” he admitted. “I have always been interested in road movies.” Perhaps that’s why the track seems like a trip to a dreamlike other world, not unlike his stage shows. Tonight, he performs at New York’s Mercury Lounge in the Lower East Side.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/listen-up-the-moody-tunes-of-dirty-beaches/

2013-06-27,Francis Bacon’s Works Steal the Sale at Sotheby’s in London,"LONDON — Two paintings by Francis Bacon — one of the artist’s favorite female model and another of a man peering at the viewer from behind a pair of delicate glasses — were the stars of Sotheby’s sale of contemporary art here on Wednesday night.It was the second night in a week of back-to-back auctions here, and the salesroom was overflowing with collectors and dealers. Most came to watch, but many bid as well. On offer were 68 works, including other examples by British artists like David Hockney and Damien Hirst, as well as an international array of blue-chip names — Lucio Fontana, Andreas Gursky and John Currin, to name a few.But while the evening brought some solid prices, it followed a similar pattern to Christie’s sale on Tuesday night. Both lacked the frenzy (and the stellar selection of material) that made up the New York sales in May. “We’re at the end of a marathon that started in New York, then moved to Hong Kong, Venice, Basel and now back to London,’’ said Harry Blain, a British dealer, ticking off the various events, including art fairs and auctions, that began in New York last month. “Still,’’ he added, “when something is rare people fight for it.’’The auction totaled $116.8 million, in the middle of its $101.2 million to $144.9 million estimate. Fifteen works failed to sell. The auction was bigger than the Christie’s event, which totaled $108.4 million, within its $86.4 million to $112 million estimate. Of the 64 works at that auction, 13 failed to sell.(Final prices include the buyer’s premium: 25 percent of the first $100,000; 20 percent from $100,000 to $2 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Both Bacon canvases were being sold by William Acquavella, the New York dealer, according to several dealers familiar with the works. The best of them — “Three Studies of Isabel Rawsthorne’’ — was a 1966 triptych of Rawsthorne, an artist, who was Bacon’s confidante and model. Two bidders fought for the painting, which was purchased by Alex Corcoran of the Lefevre Gallery in London for $17.3 million. It had been estimated to bring $15.5 million to $23.3 million. Mr. Acquavella had bought the triptych at Christie’s in London nine years ago for $4.2 million. The second Bacon — “Head III’’ — a 1949 canvas of a man’s head peering eerily out at the viewer, was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for $16.1 million, well above its $10.8 million high estimate.Abstract paintings have been all the rage recently and two works by Lucio Fontana commanded high prices. His “Concetto Spaziale, Le Chiese di Venezia,’’ a 1961 canvas inspired by the mosaics, frescoes, glass and stone of churches in Venice, which was expected to fetch $6.2 million to $9.3 million, went to a telephone bidder for $6.8 million. And Fontana’s 1965 “Concetto Spaziale, Attese,’’ a white canvas with his signature slashes that was expected to bring $5.1 million to $7 million, sold for $6.7 million to another telephone bidder.David Hockney is always a favorite in London, especially after his blockbuster exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts here last year. Both Hockney works artist brought higher than expected prices. “A Small Sunbather,’’ from 1967, depicting one of his famed subjects, swimming pools, had belonged to Stanley J. Seeger, the celebrated collector who died in 2011. Although it was expected to bring $467,000 to $780,000, it sold to a telephone bidder for $1.7 million. Mr. Seeger had bought the painting at Christie’s in New York 13 years ago for $270,000. A later Hockney work, “Double East Yorkshire,’’ a colorful landscape from 1998 that had been estimated to sell for $3.1 million to $4.6 million, went to another telephone bidder for $5.3 million.The sale also included five photographs by Andreas Gursky depicting stock exchanges around the world. They were being sold by Greg Coffey, a former hedge fund manager living in London. Among the best of them was “Chicago Board of Trade III,’’ which was estimated at $935,000 to $1.2 million and went to a telephone bidder for $3.3 million.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/francis-bacons-works-steal-the-sale-at-sothebys-in-london/

Which meant that the kickstand had to be enormous. In his sketch (see sidebar), it looks as if it might have been two feet long. A contemporary of Berruyer’s praised the invention as perfect for bons vivants who might like to stop and rest on the seats of their bicycles to light a cigar or enjoy the scenery.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/who-made-that-kickstand.html

In “TransAtlantic,” he’s used the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean — made in 1919 by the British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown — as a catalyst. In both novels these acts of bravery and skill become metaphors for more everyday acts of daring, while at the same time serving as narrative anchors for Mr. McCann’s kaleidoscopic look at an expanding circle of lives.

Yet as you watch the White House go up in flames — an image that doesn’t provoke the same shock or giggles that it did in his 1996 flick, “Independence Day” — you may wonder if every time he blows or burns something up, Mr. Emmerich, who was born in Germany in 1955, is compulsively repeating a historical trauma.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/movies/in-white-house-down-channing-tatum-rescues-the-nation.html

The Naga, a diverse collection of peoples speaking similar languages and residing in a mountainous area in northeastern India, certainly were fierce. Headhunting was one of their prized pursuits. But they were far from modern by present-day standards. In fact, the culture of the Naga was nearly destroyed by modern Europeans. First came mid-19-century subjugation by the British, who wanted to stop the irritation of headhunting raids on neighboring Indian territories. Then American Baptist missionaries invaded, eventually succeeding in almost totally suppressing the Naga’s “satanic” practices and converting nearly all of the population to nominal Christianity.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/arts/design/naga-peoples-made-beauty-from-the-ugly-in-northeastern-india.html

The three-day Battle of Gettysburg ended the Confederate invasion of the North and resulted in staggering losses — an estimated 51,000 casualties in all for the campaign — for both sides. Each year, about 1.2 million visitors journey to the Gettysburg National Military Park.

Avoiding the crowds, though, has its merits, offering a more solemn experience. Either way, Gettysburg — which is still a small town, with a population of only 7,645 — has a lot to offer beyond history lessons.

But as Jon Mooallem discovers in his ambitious and fascinating first book, “Wild Ones,” American conservation today presents a far greater conundrum than deciding what to save or even how to save it. Such efforts force us to reconsider our relationship with other species and to confront what may be our obsolete fantasy of “wilderness.” Most of all, they force us to rethink the human animal.

Any historian contemplating this event faces numerous daunting problems — apart from the fact that thousands of books and articles have already been published on the Gettysburg campaign. The ghastly scale of bloodletting has to be explained. The battlefield contest itself involved the highest possible political and national stakes.

The girl is also dead, having driven drunk. So betrayal, in a not uncommon phenomenon, has a longer life than its perpetrators: the many intervening years cannot prevent the protagonist from feeling “shocked and duped.” Such a bald statement of feeling is rare for Tuck, a writer chary with reports of her characters’ inner lives. We’re not often privy to their reflections; their thoughts tend toward memories that are not especially emotional, or local observations or desires. “She hoped the bus would not be late as it was her day to car pool.” “It might be nice, for a change, to have another female in the house.” “Dr. Harris-Mehta’s white coat, Helen notices, is buttoned up the wrong way and, briefly, she is tempted to reach over and fix it.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/books/review/lily-tucks-house-at-belle-fontaine.html

If they sound dismayingly vague and romantic, that’s because the words belong not to the writer, but to the narrator, Richard, a professor who has recently married his most gifted student. She asks him to take her to the sea, and he gallantly makes arrangements for a honeymoon in the northern Scottish archipelago of Orkney, giving no thought to what she will do once he must return to his academic responsibilities. “We talked once of her working on her doctorate with me,” he muses, “but that would be impossible now.” When he thinks of their future, he imagines “a perpetual breakfast table.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/books/review/orkney-by-amy-sackville.html

Bidart’s extreme typography helped him convey extreme states of mind; it also helped show how his lines ought to sound, read aloud. More recent and more traditionally lyrical books have taken on well-defined topics: “Desire” (1997) was largely about sex, “Watching the Spring Festival” (2008) about beauty.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/books/review/metaphysical-dog-poems-by-frank-bidart.html

It had become an immutable part of the drill: at the completion of the flight the astronaut’s wife had to leave the house and confront the Beast and all his cameras and microphones and submit to a press conference and answer questions and be the perfect Astronaut’s Wife with merely the entire world watching. It was this grim prospect that truly lacerated one’s heart while Mr. Wonderful was aloft.

Bright, cartoon colors, not to mention characters, surround you. And then there is the continuous loop of pop tunes vying with an endless whir of water — splashing, spraying, gurgling, rushing, dumping.

2013-06-28,Regular Guys at Iwo Jima,"With support-the-troops sentiment strong these days, occasionally a movie will use real soldiers or veterans in scenes. “Act of Valor” is a recent example. But the precedents for this go back a long ways and include “Sands of Iwo Jima,” the 1949 saga starring John Wayne as the classic irascible sergeant named Stryker.

For years he has been a regular collaborator with the performance artist Laurie Anderson; likewise with the jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. He has also done sturdy work with the doom merchant Stephen O’Malley, and provided fine filigree for singer-songwriters like Beth Orton and Laura Veirs.

Mr. Gideon appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously that the right to counsel in a criminal case is fundamental to the American justice system.

But Ray’s life is a mess. His wife, Abby (Paula Malcomson), a hard-core Boston Southie, is still adjusting to living in the Los Angeles suburbs. His brother Bunchy (Dash Mihok) was abused by a priest and has the alcohol problem to prove it. Another brother, Terry (Eddie Marsan), boxed too long and developed Parkinson’s. And the ghost of their little sister, who committed suicide when she was a teenager, haunts them all. Now Ray’s father, Mickey (Jon Voight), a gangster with the Irish mob, has been unexpectedly released from prison. The Season 8 premiere of “Dexter,” which finds Deb (Jennifer Carpenter) giving Dexter (Michael C. Hall) the silent treatment, leads in at 9.
