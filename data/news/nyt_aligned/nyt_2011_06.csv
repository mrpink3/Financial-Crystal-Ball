Channsin Berry and Bradinn French, “Dark Girls” takes a compelling look at the impact of colorism: a state of prejudice, conscious and unconscious, that causes both black people and white people to label as more beautiful or desirable or intelligent individuals with lighter shades of skin, particularly when it comes to black women. Few among people of color are unfamiliar with the saying: “If you are light, you are all right. If you are brown, you can stick around. If you are black, get back.” A writer in The Washington Post aptly described the phenomenon a few years ago as “the crazy aunt in the attic of racism.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/dark-times-for-dark-girls/

Reader, I did all of these things over the course of a day during Cannes. But at least let me explain. I was staying at the Hotel Martinez, which, for those unaware, becomes so brimming with celebrities (from Vanessa Hudgens to Sarah Jessica Parker) during the film festival that every paparazzo in the world, and possibly the entire population of the South of France, hold vigil outside, cameras pointed at the door until they realize you are not, in fact, Clemence Poesy (thanks, though!). So when sharing an elevator with Jude Law, whether coming from the seventh floor gym or la plage across the street, is a real possibility, being caught barefaced is a bit daunting. As for my sleeping in makeup, blame Olivier Zahm and his Purple party at Le Baron, an early flight and the lack of the will to painstakingly remove the waterproof makeup I agreed to test for The Moment.

2011-06-01,Venice Biennale: An Installation Art Contest,"VENICE — After the first day spent looking at most, but not all, of the national pavilions in the Giardini, this year’s Biennale has started to shape up as a knock-down, drag-out contest among immersive, environmental installation artworks. The battle is especially pitched on the little hillock dominated by the pavilions of Britain (Mike Nelson), Germany (Christoph Schlingensief) and France (Christian Boltanski), although the fray has also been joined by Switzerland (Thomas Hirshhorn) and the Czech Republic. At that pavilion, a little-known artist named Dominik Lang, barely 30 years old, has mounted a strangely affecting time-capsule-like installation featuring a great deal of generic postwar figurative sculpture by his father, Jiri Lang (1927-1996), who stopped making art years before his son was born. It serves as a sobering reminder of the obscurity that awaits most of the art produced at any given point in time, as well as the ability of art objects, being objects, to wait out different phases of neglect.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/venice-biennale-an-installation-art-contest/

Although Allegra is best known for her supersoft cotton shredding technique, for her latest collection, which hits stores in July, she began thinking about leather. “I asked myself, What do I want to wear as a second skin?” The results include a dappled goatskin bouclé cardigan that is as pleasing to the touch as it is to the eye — and that still leaves enough to the imagination. There are also slimming thigh-high leather leggings that mold to one’s body, supple camel leather shirts and buttery black body-con dresses that look effortless and sensual, not overripe or overtly sexy. The collection, available July 31, ranges from $250 to $1,100 and can be purchased at barneys.com or netaporter.com.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/in-her-skin-raquel-allegra/

They said they released the money after the Vatican instituted new mechanisms to help it adhere to international anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing standards. The changes included creating a financial watchdog to coordinate with international organizations — a new leaf for an organization known for its opaque finances. The Vatican on Wednesday said it “appreciated” the release of the funds. Prosecutors had preventively seized the funds last September and placed the bank’s top two financial officers under investigation on the grounds that they transferred the money without properly disclosing the sender or motive. The two officials remain under investigation but have not been charged with a crime. The Vatican has said the investigation is the result of a misunderstanding.

2011-06-02,Vain Glorious | A New Book by François Nars,"In his lush new how-to book, “Makeup Your Mind: Express Yourself,” the makeup artist François Nars uses real women as muses. Showcasing an incredible array of faces — there are all different ethnicities, ages and even a sprinkling of men — the dense tome contains “before” and “after” photos (shot by Nars himself) of each subject. A transparent overlay between the two shots shows you how and where to apply makeup, which is very effective. Seeing the outline of the shape you are trying to create helps you apply product in a more accurate, efficient way. Because you have a clear view of the “before” face, which is completely bare, you can see how a primer or a sheer glow or matte foundation changes skin quality, and how a simple application of makeup can bring a feature to life or downplay it. The book challenges you to take risks, and even the most seasoned makeup wearer will be enlightened. It brought me back to my teen years, when I delighted in playing with different, even extreme, looks. Building confidence and conveying a variety of moods through makeup, Nars inspires you to be playful, passionate, imaginative and, as he says, “have an open spirit, and believe in your own beauty.” Nars’s picks from his own line of cosmetics: the Multiple, All About Eve Eyeshadow Duo, EFA Night Infusion and the AquaGel Hydrator.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/vain-glorious-a-new-book-by-francois-nars/

In it a Chinese-built truck made to look like Thomas the Tank Engine tootles around Beijing, delighting the children it encounters. But the truck is actually on a more prosaic mission: picking up rubble from one of the city’s many construction sites and unloading it in a dump near the Summer Palace.

2011-06-02,The Werewolf Within,"I thoroughly enjoyed Alex Pappademas’s article (dare I say “tribute”?) in the magazine this week. Although “Teen Wolf” did well at the box office all those years ago, this current and rather astonishing flurry of attention and examination would certainly have been welcome on opening day. I believe that with any film, it is up to the filmmaker to put forth his or her story, and it is then up to the audience to ascribe motivations and meaning. Having said that, I thought you might be interested in a few of my intentions while directing the film. To me, this was never a film about a werewolf. It was about a normal kid fighting his way through puberty, girls, peer pressure, school, etc., who has a bomb dropped on him at the end of Act I. For me, the key scene in the film occurs when Scott, Michael J. Fox’s character, reveals the wolf for the first time in public, during a basketball game. In about 20 seconds, the reactions of the actors go from horror, fear and amazement to curiosity and acceptance.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/magazine/the-werewolf-within.html

Directed by Matthew Vaughn, “X-Men: First Class” reaches back to the early 1960s for an origin story of mutants, mad men and mods that takes some of its cues from James Bond and more than a few costumes from Austin Powers. Like “Mad Men,” this new “X-Men” indulges in period nostalgia as it gazes into the future, using the backdrop of the cold war (and its turtlenecks) to explore how the past informs the present (while also blowing stuff up).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/movies/x-men-first-class-review.html

2011-06-03,Alone to Face the Fallout From a Son’s Horrific Crime,"“Beautiful Boy” tiptoes into a minefield, where it loses its nerve and remains frozen in its tracks, too timid to find a way back. As you watch this earnest-to-a-fault, sensitively acted film about the parents of a campus killer reacting to their son’s shooting rampage and suicide, you may wonder why. Why make a fictional movie, however tasteful, about the aftermath of a horror apparently based on the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, whose perpetrator killed 32 people and then himself?

I spent the second day of press previews for the Venice Biennale in the Arsenale, a narrow gauntlet of art compared to the Giardini, with its discreet national pavilions and semblance of order. Here “ILLUMInations,” as the Biennale exhibition is called — having started in the spacious galleries of the Giardini’s Central Pavilion — becomes a kind of extended scrum, spliced with additional national pavilions. The impossible enormity of the Biennale beast begins to sink in.

In this he empathizes with his 6-year-old daughter, Lyra, who, at a friend’s urging, tuned into “Phineas and Ferb,” a TV show that she doesn’t fully get but watches “aspirationally, as a sort of challenge to herself.” ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/movies/films-in-defense-of-slow-and-boring.html

Western Union transmitted more than a million words of copy, a record that would stand until Lindbergh touched down . . . 17 years later.” And as indicated by the editors elsewhere in the book, when Jack Dempsey defended his title against Georges Carpentier, the coverage in The New York Times “consumed not just the sports section on July 3, 1921, but almost the entire paper.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/books/review/book-review-at-the-fights-american-writers-on-boxing.html

But to Edward J. Larson, a professor of history and law at Pepperdine University, the important thing about this story is not who arrived first at the pole, but who did the best field research along the way. And by this measure, Scott was the clear victor. “If the race to the South Pole eventually consumed Scott, it was never at the expense of science,” Larson contends.

During the war, threats to the life of Aurek, her young son, were everywhere: from the “filthy” skies, raked with thunder clouds and German planes, to the sunless, brambly depths of the Polish forests, where she and Aurek, like two figures in a fairy tale, hid out for years. They are rescued from a refugee camp by Janusz, the husband and father from whom they were separated at the beginning of the fighting. Janusz brings them to Ipswich, to the small house and garden that give the novel its title. There Silvana forces herself to believe that a normal life is possible: that she and Janusz will rediscover themselves as husband and wife, that Aurek will have a father — and that the secret still threatening her son’s security will stay buried.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/books/review/book-review-22-britannia-road-by-amanda-hodgkinson.html
2011-06-03,Inside the List,"CON LAW: Beach-reading season may be in full swing, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a whole lot of constitutional law being debated on the best-seller list. In “Where’s the Birth Certificate?,” at No. 14 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list, the veteran conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi argues that Barack Obama’s supposed foreign birth runs afoul of Article 2, Section 1, which requires that the president be a “natural-born citizen.” (Didn’t Donald Trump ruin that story line a few weeks ago?) Meanwhile, in Steve Berry’s latest pretzel of a thriller, “The Jefferson Key” (No. 5 on the fiction list), the swashbuckling Justice Department operative Cotton Malone comes out of semiretirement to foil a presidential assassination rooted in a secret clause encoded in Article 1, Section 8.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/InsideList-t.html

2011-06-03,The Murder That Transfixed 1930s Paris,"On Aug. 21, 1933, Violette Nozière, the 18-year-old only daughter of an engine driver and a housewife who lived in a claustrophobic two-room apartment in the working-class 12th ­Arrondissement of Paris, gave her parents drinks laced with a lethal dose of barbiturates. Her father died. Her mother, who drank only half her glass, fell into a deeply drugged sleep, but survived. When Violette was arrested — after a brief attempt at flight and a costly shopping spree paid for with her parents’ pilfered savings — she gave a full confession. She also explained, as motive for her crime, that her father had been raping her for the past six years.

They insist on stories linking them.” To create the necessary narratives, Miéville repurposes genre formulas like a salvage artist, mixing a connoisseur’s respect for recovered materials with heretical joy in putting them to surprising uses.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/books/review/book-review-embassytown-by-china-mieville.html

Four years before the Cuban missile crisis, with Fulgencio Batista still in power, Greene wrote another novel, this one about possible secret military installations in Cuba.

2011-06-03,The Mystery of a Sister’s Death,"Two years ago, a British study suggested that men and women who grew up with sisters had happier lives and rosier outlooks than men and women who didn’t. The presence of even one sister in a household was enough to foster an atmosphere of emotional openness that helped family members communicate and tackle problems. No such benefit accrued to people who had only brothers. The study was small — only 571 subjects took part — but it was heartening to think that sisters, so often portrayed as fractious rivals, envious of one another’s attractions and covetous of one another’s friends and clothes, might actually serve as mortar binding the bricks of a family’s psyche.

In fact, that “someday” the title promises may never come. Tillman’s stories are too piercing, the obsessions of her characters too connected to their psychic wounds, for them to be considered exactly “funny.” In any case, it isn’t “someday” but rather “meantime” that counts for readers. And in the meantime, Tillman’s fictions tend to be (to steal a line from one of her stories) as “outrageously ineffable, obdurate and evasive” as the forms of desire they describe. Gorgeously at ease and technically virtuosic, the stories are ever on point — on point, that is, if the point of your reading has more to do with psychological nuance and bravura performances of language than with conventional story lines.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/books/review/book-review-someday-this-will-be-funny-by-lynne-tillman.html

2011-06-06,Checking It Twice,"Whether you’re simply organized or mildy compulsive, a list can provide the structure for the everyday. However, when the to-do list is compiled by such artistic luminaries as Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder and Franz Kline, it transcends its ostensible purpose and provides insights into the life and times of its maker. This is obvious from a new show — “To-dos, Ilustrated Inventories, Collected Thoughts, and Other Artists’ Enumerations,” curated by Liza Kirwin from the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art — that opened today at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan. For example, Pablo Picasso’s recommendations for inclusion in the 1913 Armory Show, the first international exhibition of modern art in the United States, astutely foresaw the historical importance of Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger and Juan Gris. Franz Kline’s shopping list for booze for his 1960 New Year’s party was evidence of his financial success (it was a hefty bill for the time) as well as his social nature. The artist Adolf Konrad illustrated his 1962 packing list: Khaki trench. Check. Six pairs of socks. Check. Sunglasses. Check. Two lemons. Check. Ah, the beauty of the artfully organized.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/checking-it-twice/

2011-06-06,First Place for ‘X-Men: First Class’,"One of the year’s best-reviewed wide-release movies, “X-Men: First Class,” took in a solid $56 million at the North American box office over the weekend — easily enough for No. 1 and to help reboot a sagging franchise. Facing audience and critical rebellion over the last two “X-Men” installments, Tom Rothman, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox, took creative risks with “First Class” that appeared to pay off, including casting a cadre of untested young actors and approving a screenplay that includes Russian, French, German and Spanish dialogue — highly unusual for a summer blockbuster. In partial release overseas, the film took in an additional $64 million. “The Hangover Part II,” the raunchy buddy comedy from Warner Brothers, was second with an estimated $32.4 million for a two-week total of $187 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. “Kung Fu Panda 2” (DreamWorks Animation via Paramount) was third with about $24.3 million, sending its two-week total past $100 million. “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” showed continued life in fourth place, taking in about $18 million for a three-week total of $190.3 million. The crude comedy “Bridesmaids” (Universal) was fifth with about $12 million for a four-week total of $107.3 million.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/first-place-for-x-men-first-class/

2011-06-07,New York City Ballet Adjusts Its Ticket Pricing,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is not the only cultural institution around playing with its prices (raising its suggested admission fee to $25 from $20 as of July 1). New York City Ballet has also adjusted its prices for subscription tickets in Lincoln Center’s David H. Koch Theater for its 2011-12 season in an effort to increase ticket revenue by 5 to 10 percent, the company’s spokesman, Robert Daniels, said in a telephone interview. City Ballet, whose dancers include, at left, Robert Fairchild and Teresa Reichlen, is not simply raising prices.

The sculpture, a dynamic steel and wood complex of bird, ladybug and butterfly condos, sits between 20th and 21st Streets, and serves as a sort of gateway onto the High Line microclimate known as the Chelsea Thicket. Among its noteworthy amenities are feeding trays that will be regularly restocked with seeds and nectar, and miniature troughs designed to catch rainwater. But as with any luxury real estate development — even one with a boldfaced name attached to it — its occupancy rate is not a guarantee. “It’s really an experiment,” says Lauren Ross, the curator and director of arts programs at Friends of the High Line, adding that Sze consulted various urban birding groups but received conflicting predictions. “It functions first and foremost as sculpture.

The owner, Steve Casselman, a brewer in Santa Clara, Calif., began experimenting with beer-based candy more than 10 years ago with lollipops. More recently, he’s used beer to flavor the caramel fillings for chocolate-covered candies, which he’s been selling online since fall.

Mr. Krakoff, trying to establish a look with his still-new signature label, makes progress with a more feminine-looking bunch of clothes that plays on rounded edges, easy volumes and intense colors offset by fleshy beige tones. Those colors — ultraviolet blue and green, coral and cinnamon — are his strength. They’re sharp and specific, with a modern art reference that he likes. See a green panel on a sleeveless wrap dress in an abstract blue python print, and you think, as intended, Rothko. It’s not all highfalutin: Mr. Krakoff also showed a well-done blazer in beige lightweight wool with a double lapel, a nice way to suggest layering. He paired the jacket with soft red trousers. Also strong were a leather shift, pounded thin like a cutlet, and an electric blue python skirt with pleating at one side.",Style,https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/the-resort-shows-artists-and-rebels/

(No, not the Rolling Stones, the other guys.) A statement from Live Nation said Mr. McCartney’s performance at Yankee Stadium “can safely be predicted to feature some nearly three hours of the world’s best loved and most known music, with hits, deep cuts and surprises spanning his unrivaled career,” including the 2008 album “Electric Arguments” that he released under the name the Fireman.

Market stalls brimming with asparagus and fava beans, specialty shops selling cured meats, and osterias serving fresh pasta with the city’s signature ragù (known as Bolognese in the rest of the world) offer compelling reasons to linger. And then there are architectural masterpieces like the church of Santo Stefano and the iconic Due Torri (Two Towers). Grittier than in most of its northern counterparts, Bologna’s politics — the last mayor, Flavio Delbono, resigned when it was alleged that he was using public money on his mistress, and now residents are waiting to see if the new mayor, Virginio Merola, will make good on his promise to spruce up the city center — somehow only adds to the excitement of a visit here.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/travel/36-hours-in-bologna.html

Edstrand now splits her time between Paris and Jaipur, India, where she moved six years ago and where her one-year-old line is produced by traditional craftsmen. “The embroidery that’s done here is unbelievable,” Edstrand says. “When I showed one of my pieces to Manish Arora” — the New Delhi designer who’s known as the John Galliano of India — “he couldn’t believe it. And people here are not afraid of color.” Neither is Edstrand, who named the line for her favorite Pantone shade, a bright fuchsia. Lampshades, children’s wear and bridal pieces are coming up next, and Edstrand is happy to undertake custom orders. She claims she had no thoughts of YSL when she was designing her pieces but is happy to report that Stefano Pilati has already bought one of her heart belts. “I’m inspired by happiness and lightness,” she says. “That’s really where the collection is coming from.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/uncommon-threads-sophia-203/

(A lot of people say no, even though many museums receive relatively little in the way of public subsidies.) Do museums have a kind of moral obligation, like libraries, to be free? (Museum directors are divided on the subject. Some, like Philippe de Montebello, the former director of the Met, point out that almost all cultural goods come with a price. “Philosophically, what is it about a work of art that makes it mandatory that it should be available for nothing?” he has asked.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/arts/design/metropolitan-museum-admission-fee-debate.html

This performer is, of course, a stand-in for Sayles himself, who has also built an elaborate house of tiles and managed, against all odds, to keep it standing. The book opens in 1897, the year of the Klondike gold rush, and closes in 1903, the year after the Philippine-American War ended, and in between it takes the measure of America on the brink of the 20th century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-a-moment-in-the-sun-by-john-sayles.html

As a no-holds-barred celebration of this mentality, the lounge, in collaboration with a performer who goes by the name Calamity Chang, hosts an annual Drunken Dragon Festival, where for five hours a completely free open bar and passed hors d’oeuvres menu attract a cast of hundreds costumed in either 1940s colonial or Chinese attire. At the most recent incarnation of the event, several burlesque performers took over the main room, which was packed with revelers and covered in a blanket of confetti. And yes, the snake is real. A smaller version of the madness, Drunken Dragon Nights, is held weekly, downstairs at Macao, and features live burlesque performances.

2011-06-10,"The Idea of Germany, From Tacitus to Hitler","Why is there a Germany? Part of the answer goes back to a battle fought in A.D. 9 in the treacherous marshes and dense thickets of Teutoburg Forest, near modern Osnabrück. As described by the Roman historian Tacitus, three Roman legions led by Quinctilius Varus had crossed the Rhine from Gaul, intent on incorporating the vast area known as Germania into the empire. They were ambushed and annihilated by German tribes under the command of a warrior named Arminius. It was one of the worst military disasters the Romans ever suffered. Some years ago, archaeologists discovered the site of the battle; the debris field was a mile wide and 15 miles long. Caesar Augustus, it is said, roamed the hallways of his palace, crying, “Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions!” Henceforth, the Romans pretty much wrote off the area east of the Rhine and north of the Alps. The line of demarcation survives to this day as a cultural divide — beer versus wine, butter versus oil, Germanic versus Romance.

You might say that Huene (pronounced HEW-neh) sealed the deal between modern-thinking couturiers and photographers, seducing us with light and classical forms. Afterward, nothing seemed the same.

His experiments tend to involve things like dropping people off amusement park thrill rides (to measure the way time seems to slow down during near-death experiences) and hanging out in the studio with Brian Eno and the drummer from Coldplay (to see how professional timekeepers stay precisely on the beat). He wears hip ankle boots and designer jeans while dashing between TED talks and his lab at Baylor. In his spare time, Eagleman has even written an acclaimed collection of speculative short stories, “Sum: Forty Tales From the Afterlives,” that will be staged as a full opera in London next year. He’s also getting some traction with his efforts to start a new quasi-religious movement called Possibilianism, which aims to move beyond the dueling certitudes of traditional religion and atheism to explore radical what-ifs about the universe and human consciousness. One story in “Sum,” for example, considers the possibility that life on earth may be just a brief, pleasurable vacation from our true existence as gigantic beings doing the heavy lifting of holding up the cosmos.

Due to an irrevocable death sentence, imminent mob execution or torture to death, these philosophers found themselves in the most paradoxical of situations: lovers of logic and rational argumentation, silenced by brute force; professional makers of discourses, banned from using the word; masters of debate and contradiction, able to argue no more. What was left of these philosophers then? Just their silence, their sheer physical presence.

The film, directed by J. J. Abrams, is one of the few summer releases that does not benefit from being a sequel or having a built-in fan base. In an effort to offset this handicap and spread some quick word of mouth Paramount Pictures held early screenings on Thursday and urged customers to tweet about the film. Private screenings were also held on Wednesday night for Twitter users with large numbers of followers. “X-Men: First Class” from 20th Century Fox held steady at second place with $25 million, dropping 55 percent from last weekend’s total, an above-average second-week showing for a summer blockbuster. That franchise reboot has accumulated a North American total of $98.9 million, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks sales data. “The Hangover Part II” (Warner Brothers) was third with $18.5 million, proving the continued appeal of the misadventures of the Wolf Pack. In fourth place, “Kung Fu Panda 2” (DreamWorks Animation, via Paramount) piled on another $16.6 million. At fifth place with $10.8 million, “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” (Walt Disney Studios) crossed the $200 million mark in North America. So far at this summer’s box office, ticket sales are up 13.5 percent compared with this stage in the season last year, but are still down 9 percent for the year so far.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/movies/super-8-surprises-viewers-and-the-box-office.html

She also has home décor and ready-to-wear lines, both of which feature cheerful graphics and mod silhouettes. And while it’s taken a while, London hipsters have finally lit upon her her clothing designs, which make references to the Chelsea girl charm of Mary Quant, Julie Christie and Jean Shrimpton. Thanks to bright young fans like Alexa Chung and Keira Knightley, Kiely is enjoying some well-deserved celebrity on her home turf. It helps, of course, that she has a bevy of cool girls working for her. Venetia Scott, the Marc Jacobs stylist-turned-photographer, shoots her ad campaigns, and Leith Clark, the Canadian editor of the British indie fashion magazine Lula, styles them. Her first American store is set to open in SoHo in September. In anticipation, Kiely’s hosting an event at the Ace Hotel tomorrow night. Chung will D.J. and Mercedes Heinwein’s short film about the fall collection, which was inspired by Tippi Hedren’s wardrobe in “The Birds,” will be screened.

2011-06-14,Major Art Gift to Stanford,"In an economically rough period when many university art museums seem to be in a position of retreat, Stanford University plans to announce on Tuesday that it will soon be a major West Coast presence in postwar art. The university is accepting a donation of works from one of the most important private collections of Abstract Expressionism. The group of 121 paintings and sculptures, owned by Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson, had long been expected to make its way to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has been the beneficiary of the Andersons for many years. But the couple, known as Hunk and Moo, said in a statement that “we have always been closely associated with colleges and universities, and in making this gift to Stanford we anticipate the students, the public and the entire art community will have the opportunity to fully engage the collection.” The collection, which the Andersons began building in the 1960s, includes one of the last major Jackson Pollock drip paintings still in private hands, “Lucifer,” from 1947, when Pollock was making his transition from a more traditional style to his signature volcanic canvases. Several years ago dealers familiar with the painting said that the Andersons had turned down as much as $100 million for it. The collection also includes significant works by Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis and Philip Guston. Stanford said that by 2014 it expected to complete construction of a building to house the collection, which includes 86 artists in all, in styles including Abstract Expressionism and reflecting movements like Light and Space and Color Field painting.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/arts/design/major-art-gift-to-stanford.html

Rob McKenna, a Republican who is the state’s attorney general, announced his long-anticipated candidacy last week. Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat whose district includes parts of the politically crucial Seattle region, has signaled for months that he would run if Ms. Gregoire did not. The state, like many others, has been forced to make major spending cuts, including to schools and social programs, and the question is whether frustration with the its direction will be enough to overcome Democratic control.

On Wednesday, HarperCollins Children’s Books said an application would be released for Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch devices based on Mr. Yankovic’s best-selling children’s book, “When I Grow Up.” The original book, written by Mr. Yankovic (who, in a rare career move, did not declare himself to be “Weird” on its cover) and illustrated by Wes Hargis, follows an 8-year-old boy named Billy as he considers grown-up career options, such as becoming a doctor, firefighter, giraffe milker or snail trainer. The “When I Grow Up” app, which is developed by the Web design company Bean Creative, offers interactive games and features based on the book, including the option to have Mr. Yankovic read it to you, and opportunities to practice some of Billy’s more fanciful future occupations, such as shaving a tarantula or massaging a gorilla. Mr. Yankovic said in a statement that when he was a child, “I dreamed of one day helping to produce a cross-platform app that would be sold in the iTunes Store.” He added: “I was a very prescient kid.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/for-his-childrens-book-weird-al-gets-a-weird-app/

The rare splash of color came from the blue advertisements for a billboard company that read: “What do our boards have in common with the C.I.A.? They’re both all over the place.” In the two decades since then, Beirut has become a monument to globalism, home to Louis Vuitton, Chanel and the priciest hotels, the power of capitalism concealing but never really healing the war’s scars. Among the chrome-and-glass buildings downtown stands a grand statue of Riyadh al-Solh, a founder of modern Lebanon, looking like a fat and happy pasha. And beneath that statue, in a patch of bare sand he calls the Square of Change, sits a lonely man named Tony Daoud.

2011-06-17,The Video Explorer," About five years ago, a prodigious young French filmmaker named Vincent Moon reinvented the music video. Filming in an intimate cinéma vérité style in odd locations, mostly around Paris, Moon created dozens and dozens of raw, enigmatic clips that stripped away everything but the performer and the song. He put musicians in awkward situations, and the results were magnetic. He set up the band Phoenix, already fairly famous at that point, as buskers in a sea of tourists outside the Eiffel Tower; the National sat crammed elbow to elbow around a picnic table in the South of France; Yo La Tengo played a Troggs cover amid squealing schoolchildren in Montmartre. But it was the clip of Arcade Fire — 10 of them, strings, horns, xylophone, guitar — packed into an elevator and singing, with the rip of magazine pages for percussion, that came to represent Moon’s innovative new oeuvre. A combination cool-hunter and documentarian, Moon proved it’s possible to reinvent an old, tired format (the music video) using the very thing (the Internet) that supposedly killed it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/magazine/vincent-moons-take-away-videos.html

A new sort of urban star now shines out nightly, horrible, unearthly, obnoxious to the human eye; a lamp for a nightmare! Such a light as this should shine only on murders and public crime or along the corridors of lunatic asylums, a horror to heighten horror. To look at it only once is to fall in love with gas, which gives a warm domestic radiance.” Technologies past are always “warmer” than the harsh, cold, high-tech future, even in the 19th century.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/magazine/lights-out.html

The treatment for this side effect is epinephrine, which I carry with me as a precaution. My doctor recently announced that after each injection, I must wait 30 minutes before leaving the clinic. There is no reason I would be able to use an Epi-pen after 30 minutes but not before, but he says, “These are new guidelines from the manufacturer, and I won’t allow you to be dosed unless you agree to comply with them, here and now.” Is this a textbook example of coercion?

(The fifth orientation was “productive,” which focuses on experience and human connection.) Fromm specifically linked the hoarding orientation to the Protestant work ethic and the American merchant middle class and argued that this orientation is characterized by, among other things, being “constipated and squinty.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/magazine/exploring-the-landscapes-of-other-peoples-trash.html

Roberts’s descriptions of soldiers and officers are masterly and humane, and his battlefield set pieces are as gripping as any I have ever read. He has visited many of the battlefields, and has an unusually good eye for detail as well as a painterly skill at physical description. (His nearly perfect sense of terrain and geography is marred only by his regrettable conflation of Russia with the Soviet Union, which leads to confusion about battlefield locations, German war aims and Soviet casualties.) He is just as much at home at sea as on land; from Midway to El Alamein his prose is unerringly precise and stirringly vivid. It is hard to imagine a better-told military history of World War II.

In her slim but ambitious book, “The Central Park Five: A Chronicle of a City Wilding,” Sarah Burns tackles this same question, but with a changed referent. “This,” rather than signifying a horrific gang rape in New York City’s bucolic backyard, here signifies a preventable miscarriage of justice that put five Harlem teenagers behind bars for a crime they didn’t commit. Each of the boys — Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise and Raymond Santana Jr. — served between 7 and 13 years. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 by the New York State Supreme Court, after a confession and DNA analysis linked a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, to the crime.

(It opens to the public today.)

Patchett’s best-­selling 2001 novel, “Bel Canto,” opened with a botched terrorist operation in a South American country, after which an American opera diva, a Japanese industrialist, a French ambassador, various Russian businessmen and their Marxist-Leninist guerrilla captors turned their long captivity into a peculiar sort of idyll. “State of Wonder,” Patchett’s eighth book and sixth novel, is no less multinational in its cast of characters, or high-stakes in its plot.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-state-of-wonder-by-ann-patchett.html

2011-06-17,When Women Lost the Vote,"I wonder how today’s advice columnists might handle a query John Dunton received in 1691. A London printer and bookseller, Dunton was the great-granddaddy of all agony aunts and uncles. He had offered to answer questions from readers of his periodical, The Athenian Mercury. Someone asked him what a man should do if his mother and his sweetheart were in equal peril at the same time. Which one should he save? Dunton suggested that “we esteem it more generous, were it possible, to die himself than lose either.” Gallant Mr. Dunton appears nearly halfway through Mary Beth Norton’s suggestive if idiosyncratic new book, “Separated by Their Sex.” He is a villain in the story, since Norton assigns him the role of defining women as suited to the soft glories of home life and men as strivers in the public world. His chivalry was part of a larger effort to keep the “fair sex” away from political power.

Photographs and illustrations of Charcot’s patients, all women suffering hysteria, remain in currency today, 140 years after they were made, if more as curiosities than as clinically valuable documents. Once seen, these images — of, for example, a woman wearing little more than a tangle of bed sheets, her eyes rolled up into her head in either “ecstasy” or “delirium,” or fixed on the invisible object of her “amorous supplication” — are not easily forgotten, let alone dismissed. Poses classified as “passionate attitudes,” they have the disquieting aspect of pornography masquerading as intellectual inquiry.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-medical-muses-hysteria-in-nineteenth-century-paris-by-asti-hustvedt.html

The pair, who murdered Snyder’s husband, embodied the sort of colorful contradictions that reporters love — and that novelists are hard-pressed to better.

In his engagingly irreverent new best seller, The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry (Riverhead, $25.95), the journalist Jon Ronson notes that only about one in 100 people are psychopaths (there is a higher proportion in prisons and corporate boardrooms), but he wonders if this population will be overrepresented among readers of his book. After all, people do enjoy learning about themselves, and psychopaths in particular have an enhanced sense of their own importance. And they might like what Ronson has to say. He approvingly quotes experts who argue that psychopaths make “the world go around.” Despite their small numbers, they cause such chaos that they remold society — though not necessarily for the better.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/im-ok-youre-a-psychopath.html
2011-06-17,"Malcolm X: Criminal, Minister, Humanist, Martyr","“His aura was too bright,” the poet Maya Angelou said of her first meeting with Malcolm X. “His masculine force affected me physically. A hot desert storm eddied around him and rushed to me, making my skin contract, and my pores slam shut.” Malcolm X had that same sort of bone-deep, visceral impact on America. He got under everyone’s skin — either in the sense that he seeped into your pores and transformed you the way the great love of your life does, or in the sense that he annoyed or scared the living hell out of you. There is no middle ground with Malcolm. If you hate him or distrust him, you should consider giving him another try: officers assigned to monitor the wiretaps on his phones sometimes ended up being flipped, because close listening led them to believe that his programs and philosophies were sensible and righteous and that law enforcement agencies should not have been working against him at all. And while Malcolm’s ideas changed America, his life journey has captivated us even more. He went from a petty criminal and drug user to a long-term prisoner to an influential minister to a separatist political activist to a humanist to a martyr. Throughout his life he continually grew upward, unafraid to challenge or refute what he believed, giving hope that any of us can rise above even our deepest convictions to become better people.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-malcolm-x-by-manning-marable.html

Interviews of scientists were crosscut with those of self-proclaimed mystics, and swooping in to explain the physics was Dr. Quantum, a cartoon superhero who joyfully demonstrated concepts like wave-particle duality, extra dimensions and quantum entanglement. Wiggling his eyebrows, the good doctor ominously asked, “Are we far enough down the rabbit hole yet?” All that was missing was Grace Slick wailing in the background with Jorma Kaukonen on ­guitar.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-how-the-hippies-saved-physics-by-david-kaiser.html

Lifton is perhaps best known as the author of “Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima,” published in 1967, which received a National Book Award. In that book, he described how the hibakusha, those residents of Hiroshima who survived the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, lived with deep and shameful feelings of being “inwardly poisoned” by their experience, as well as an embittered “sense of special knowledge” that set them apart from those who had not witnessed the horrors of the attack.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-witness-to-an-extreme-century-by-robert-jay-lifton.html

Soldiers who were already wearing berets, and who will continue to wear them — like Special Forces, airborne troops and Army Rangers — were not happy either. They thought that having every soldier wear a beret diminished the work they had done to earn theirs. The decision by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Army chief of staff, reverses a policy laid down by a predecessor, Gen. Eric Shinseki. The patrol cap looks like a baseball cap, but with a flat, not rounded, top.

If Buster had made this film it would be all baseball, and the actual point of view, looking up at grownups twice his size, would surely feature more chins and nostrils. The angle might seem a small thing, but it can alter the feeling in subtle ways. Looking at children, our perspective is angled down and as they look up, we see eyes, those big ones, looking up like lasers.

2011-06-22,The End of AfPak,"Remember how after 9/11, Osama bin Laden’s attacks on us could be linked to almost anything, from shopping habits to the rediscovery of Western values to carbon-pricing schemes?  Something similar appears to be happening with Bin Laden’s death. Jihadism sure isn’t what it used to be. After 10 years, it seems, the time has come to go home. Troops are and will be coming back to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan. The military budget will be cut. The outgoing secretary of defense feels able to openly mock NATO because, presumably, he thinks he can afford to — because it doesn’t matter all that much. The global war on terror is being downgraded from Armageddon to something more out of Leviticus: a tricked-out police action, just as John Kerry, in this magazine, always said it should be. On Sunday, Helene Cooper and Mark Landler reported that “American success in the counterterrorism campaign would seem to bolster arguments for a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan.” By Tuesday morning, they were reporting that President Obama would announce his withdrawal plans on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Harris poll revealed that 51 percent of Americans and 54 percent of Britons believed “the death of Bin Laden meant it was time to bring troops from their countries home.”",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/the-end-of-afpak/

There was a noticeable excitement in the air as this was the first Design Miami/Basel under the new directorship of Marianne Goebl. Her debut did not disappoint: a record 43 exhibitors showing everything from 20th-century classics to contemporary designers, intelligent design collaborations with corporate sponsors (take note, Art Basel V.I.P. lounge), a great bookstore (courtesy of doyoureadme?! from Berlin) and a well-curated series of talks (full disclosure: I moderated one of them). Design Miami/Basel may keep flourishing thanks to the cross-pollinating effect from the neighboring art fair(s), but judging by the increasingly educated and design-passionate public, it seems that the fair could very well stand on its own if it had to.

Sticks of sugar cane are marinated in mojito and caipirinha baths and stuck into a bowl of crushed ice. Diners would pick them up and chew the cane to get the cocktail’s essence. Once I was home, I tried it with sticks of pineapple core and a mixture that suggested both drinks.

2011-06-22,Fantasy Focus: Pitching Observations,"Brandon League blew three consecutive save chances in May (and absorbed four losses in four straight outings) but still has 20 saves on the year, one off the league lead. The Mariners are likely to generate more save situations than the average team because their pitcher-friendly park, strong starting staff, solid defense and terrible offense ensure that many of their wins are by small margins. League doesn’t strike out too many batters (20 in 30 2/3 innings), but he has walked only five, keeps the ball on the ground (2-to-1 ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio) and averages 96 miles per hour on his fastball. He came out of Tuesday’s loss in Washington after a line drive hit him on the leg and could miss some time.Trevor Cahill went from a seven-walk, zero-strikeout disaster start on June 14 to an eight-inning, one-walk, seven-strikeout gem on Sunday. You can usually predict what stars like Roy Halladay and Justin Verlander will do on one end, and how players like Joe Saunders and Rodrigo Lopez will fare on the other. The 90 percent of pitchers in between can pretty much do anything on a given day.

For Balthus the talisman was the tablier he picked up at the American Hospital in Paris during World War II, which he wore religiously. Balthus always painted in the smock, using it like a cloth to wipe his brushes clean. It was never washed and, over 60 odd years, it accumulated layer upon layer of pigment, becoming an artwork in itself. The artist Katerina Jebb, who uses scanners and copy machines in her work, has scanned the front and back of the tablier in 12-by-16-inch fragments to create a life-size copy of it on paper that will be shown at the Balthus Chapel in the village of Rossinière, Switzerland from June 25, 2011 through May, 2012.

2011-06-22,The Huntsman Candidacy,"Can a moderate Republican win the G.O.P. nomination? That’s the question everyone’s asking with regard to Jon Huntsman, who formally announced his candidacy yesterday, and the answer is a resounding yes. From George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole through George W. Bush and John McCain, the modern-day Republican Party has a long tradition of picking nominees whose records and positions place them to the left of True Conservatism, at least as defined by movement institutions, talk radio and the like. Even in the age of the Tea Party, there’s reason to imagine this pattern persisting: Many Republican primary voters hold heterodox positions (for instance, on tax increases on the rich) relative to the official conservative line, several of the crucial early primaries allow independents to cross over and vote, and in races against incumbent presidents there’s a high premium on electability. It’s certainly possible for a Republican to be too liberal for the primary electorate, and often a moderate candidate has to flip-flop on a key issue (or six) to appease the party’s interest groups. But the historical record suggests that there’s more room between Rush Limbaugh and the center than many commentators (and politicians) seem to think.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/the-huntsman-candidacy/

Now that I’m teaching photography at Pomona College, I knit on the train during my commute, and it’s a great way to pass the time in faculty meetings.” Auerbach, who lives and works in a space in downtown Los Angeles (which she shares with several other artists), still knits the old-fashioned way, with needles, but her studio also houses two computer-controlled knitting machines.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/seeing-things-studio-visit-lisa-anne-auerbach/

And those garment bags — the really thick ones from nice stores? They are just as bad, perhaps worse for appearing to be extra protective. Barbara Harman knows this, and it is part of the reason she founded the Butler’s Closet, a new Web-based business that specializes in covers for clothing, furniture, linens and other precious things. The covers, made from fabric that is free of chemicals, bleaches, sizing and dyes, meet the same textile conservation standards used by museum curators.

Her finds have included antique whalebone poker chips in Montevideo, Uruguay, textiles from a Guatemalan village and vintage arrows at a flea market in rural Texas. This inspiration from travel is delightfully apparent in her resort collection, “Paradise Is an Island.” The assortment is a tropical concoction of polychromatic glass beads, winsome brass arrowheads and carnelian tusks, all strung together on gold chains and rope — the perfect colorful addition to an urbanite’s summer wardrobe. Despite each piece having names of exotic vacation hot spots, like “Easter Island Necklace,” the root of the label could not be more down-to-earth. For Fortunato, jewelry has always been a natural outlet. “By the time I was in college, I was fashioning statement necklaces out of industrial bolts and chains, glass beads that a friend toted back from South Africa and family heirloom pieces — literally anything I could get my hands on,” she explains. The results are a fusion of high and low, with thoughtful handiwork and smart combinations of pearls, colorful rope and shapely gold.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/dont-forget-resort-jewels-lizzie-fortunato/

It wouldn’t be possible, they informed me, because we weren’t Episcopalians.

2011-06-24,The Rules: Version Française,"In “De la Séduction” (“On Seduction”), the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard defined his subject as “the mastery of the symbolic universe.” His point was that in contrast to political power, which involves “the mastery of the real universe,” seduction is a deft manipulation of rituals and codes, “a never ending game” that seducer and seduced play for its own sake, delighting in its elegant formulas and subtle challenges. Understood in this way, seduction is less a means to sexual conquest than an end in itself, an exquisitely refined form of social interaction. As the celebrity intellectual (and self-styled séducteur) Bernard-Henri Lévy has put it: “Civilization is seduction. What separates man from the animals is seduction.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/book-review-la-seduction-by-elaine-sciolino.html

Cárdenas decided to contest local races across Mexico, and in 1989 Castañeda traveled to the town of Tepoztlán as an election observer.

The situation is less ideal than it sounds: omnipotence can be a dreary limitation. That’s why the best novelists are also childlike.

A lady who’d come for tea mentioned a friend who had a brother, a Princeton man, who was looking for two college-educated women to teach at a schoolhouse he’d built with his neighbors in the Elkhead Mountains of Colorado. Instantly, both knew they wanted to go. One of them, Dorothy Woodruff, was the grandmother of Dorothy Wickenden. And in “Nothing Daunted,” Wickenden has painstakingly recreated the story of how that earlier Dorothy and her friend Rosamond Underwood embarked on a brief but life-changing adventure, teaching the children of struggling homesteaders. Mining a trove of letters as well as oral histories and period documents, including an autobiography published by their employer, Farrington (Ferry) Carpenter, Wickenden lets their tale of personal transformation open out to reveal the larger changes in the rough-and-tumble society of the West — “a back story,” as she aptly puts it, “to America’s leap into the 20th century.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/book-review-nothing-daunted-by-dorothy-wickenden.html

Just a gig at a crummy club near CBGB, and late — after 1. There weren’t a dozen onlookers, but Hüsker Dü’s two early records were knockouts, and that Minneapolis trio never came east, so there we were. From our booth in back the music sounded terrific: headlong and enormous, the guitar unfashionably full, expressive and unending, with two raving vocalists alternating leads on songs whose words were hard to understand and whose tunes weren’t.

From his 1970s glory days as the jive-talking lead singer of Aerosmith to his unlikely TV success as a judge on “American Idol,” he’s always delighted in babble for its own sake. In his words, he’s been “61 Highwayed and I did it my wayed; Little-Willie-Johned and been-here-and-goned; million-dollar riffed and Jimmy Cliffed; cotton-picked and Stevie Nick’d.” What he lacks in lucidity, which is just about every­thing, he makes up for with garrulous charm.

The more detail, the better. The English novelist Tim Parks understands that principle. In his urbane, droll, weird yet far from charmless account of the pain and misery suffered by his body in general, and by his bladder, prostate, penis and related bits in particular, the conversion is from a cerebral, anxious, hunched-over and compulsively verbal kvetch (not his term, but the literal “squeeze” makes the Yiddish word seem appropriate) to something resembling the opposite.

But really what we’re saying is that the Mona Lisa is famous because it’s more like the Mona Lisa than anything else.” In other words, we are trapped inside a hall of mirrors of our own devising. We think the Mona Lisa is famous because of its traits, but we think those traits are significant only because they belong to the Mona Lisa, which we know to be famous. Ditto Shakespeare? Yes.

The imagination of disaster is never far from these pages, and though this house will finally stay on its foundation, it does get swamped by a monsoon-swelled river, and with consequences that are bitter indeed. That waterfront property is only one of the three houses in which Roy’s narrative is played out — each of them bedraggled, each living on after its time, and none of them a proper home.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/book-review-an-atlas-of-impossible-longing-by-anuradha-roy.html

While waiting, she blogs. Through a suicide note that eventually becomes an autobiography almost perfectly contemporary with “the American Century,” we learn that Pam has been many things: rich mother’s regret, successful author, war correspondent, diplomat’s wife.

2011-06-24,Cambodia After Year Zero,"In the preface to “Cambodia’s Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land,” Joel Brink­ley recalls his first encounter with Cambodia. Brinkley was reporting for The Louisville Courier-Journal from a refugee camp near the Thai border in 1979, in the aftermath of Pol Pot’s reign. “As they tell of years of horror and misery,” Brinkley wrote, “their faces are expressionless and dull . . . as if they’re talking about a dull day of work. Their tales end with a nodding acknowledgment of the death of their nation and culture.” Brinkley, who later worked for The New York Times, finds little has changed in the 32 years since then. As the title suggests, his book is an unabashed plea to refocus international aid and diplomacy on a suffering people. It is also an attempt to hold some of those responsible for that suffering accountable — but not all.Cambodia lost a quarter of its population under the Khmer Rouge. For many, survival meant 14-hour days of backbreaking work, often on little more than a cupful of rice or a smattering of gruel. You could be killed on the least suspicion you sympathized with the Vietnamese.

2011-06-24,Videophiles | Xeno & Oaklander’s ‘The Staircase’,"Just when you thought winter was finally over, a cold front suddenly hits. The new video for “The Staircase,” by the synth pop group Xeno & Oaklander, which makes is United States premiere on The Moment today, epitomizes the cool aesthetic of the underground minimal electronics movement. The video has the quality of a Xerox, reproduced over and over, blown out and dark, and induces a sense of something lost. Sean McBride and Miss Liz Wendelbo, the duo behind Xeno & Oaklander, along with other members of the Wierd Records label, have been largely credited with the revival of minimal wave here in New York. Taryn Waldman of Boxmotion, who directed the “The Staircase,” and Patrick Stroub, its cinematographer, make references to Roman Polanski’s film “Repulsion,” as a slip of a woman, Xeno (Wendelbo), climbs the stairs of a claustrophobic 19th-century Brooklyn tenement building, seemingly unaware that the object of her affection and of her voyeurism, Oaklander (McBride), is right next to her. (Xeno’s stark, wintry eyes come courtesy of the master retoucher Pascal Dangin, known in fashion circles for his work for Annie Leibovitz, Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Meisel, Steven Klein, Craig McDean and others.)

How sales hold up, however, will be watched carefully. “Cars 2,” directed by John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar, represents an end to the studio’s perfect critical track record; only about 34 percent of reviews were positive, according to RottenTomatoes.com, by far the worst for any Pixar title.The R-rated comedy “Bad Teacher” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was a stronger-than-expected second with about $31 million in ticket sales — a result that cements mega-raunchy films as one of Hollywood’s best performers of the moment. “Green Lantern” (Warner Brothers) fell 65 percent in its second weekend to third place, taking in about $18.4 million for a new total of $89 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. “Super 8” (Paramount Pictures) continued to show strength in its third weekend, selling about $12 million for a new total of $95 million. “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” (20th Century Fox) was fifth with about $10.3 million for a two-week total of $39.4 million.

In Ontario, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival’s new revival of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” the 1971 rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice about the last week of Jesus’ life, has received rave reviews from local theater critics, prompting New York producers and other critics to book flights to Toronto for a look. Mr. Lloyd Webber, who holds the rights to mount a Broadway revival, saw the production this month and called it “fabulous,” adding that it was “very probably the best acted performance of the show I have ever seen.” Mr. Rice has also seen it, adding to the buzz that the production might have a life beyond Stratford. The director, Des McAnuff, who is also artistic director of the festival, said in a telephone interview that “we’re definitely taking calls from New York and elsewhere about having a future elsewhere, but it’s very much an open question.” Asked about a transfer to Broadway, Mr. McAnuff said, “We would of course love to move this and love an opportunity to take our Stratford company members with us if we go.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/theater/raves-for-superstar.html
2011-06-27,AMC Chief Responds to ‘Killing’ Complaints,"The president of the cable channel AMC said he didn’t regret the cliffhanger ending of “The Killing” a week ago but admitted there was a lesson to be learned. “We underestimated the passion” viewers have for closure within a season, Charlie Collier  told Entertainment Weekly on Friday. “If I could do anything differently, it would be to manage expectations.” Many fans of “The Killing” (with Mireille Enos, above), which is about an investigation into the death of a teenage girl in Seattle, were left fuming when the first season ended on June 19 without an explanation for the crime. The anger was noticeable on social media Web sites, prompting Mr. Collier’s acknowledgment. “The audience has an important voice, we heard them and don’t take them for granted,” he said. Mr. Collier said he stood by the show’s executive producer, Veena Sud, who told the public radio show “The Business,” last week that the investigation would be resolved in Season 2. Ms. Sud recounted a conversation on one Web site that had a viewer declaring, “I’ll never ever come back for season two.” She said, “On the same thread three more people popped up and said: ‘I haven’t watched this show yet, but now I will because you guys are so emotional about it, it’s gotta be something to watch.’ So that’s a great thing.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/arts/television/amc-chief-responds-to-killing-complaints.html

The Boston Globe reported that after a lengthy investigation into the work, an oil portrait by the Dutch painter Eglon van der Neer, the museum determined that it had belonged to Walter Westfeld, who had run a German gallery shut down by the Nazis in 1936 and who was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. The museum, which purchased the painting in 1941, posted an image of it online in 2000 amid concerns about its provenance; in 2004 it was contacted by Fred Westfield, a nephew of the art dealer. Mr. Westfield, a retired economics professor in Tennessee, learned about the painting from a Google search.

The area has been unsettled since April 2008, when at least eight Tibetans were killed by Chinese security forces firing into a crowd of protestors, Tibetan exile groups said at the time. Those protests took place as part of a large uprising that began in Lhasa, Tibet, and unfolded across the Tibetan plateau.

2011-06-30,No Buyer for Chaplin Film at Auction,"When it comes to motion pictures, Charlie Chaplin is the man, no? Well, an all-but-forgotten short film featuring footage of the comic star failed to sell at a London auction, defying expectations that it might fetch a six-figure sum, Reuters reported. The reserve price on the film at Wednesday’s sale was £100,000 ($160,000) at Bonhams auctioneers, but apparently that was too high. “Charlie Chaplin in ‘Zepped,’ ” is believed to be a propaganda film made in Britain during World War I. A collector discovered the seven-minute short inside an old film reel tin and bought it in 2009 for £3.20 (about $5) on the online auction site eBay. The film shows Chaplin taking on a German Zeppelin aircraft and features some of the earliest animation in film history. Chaplin probably never knew of the movie’s existence, said the film critic and Chaplin biographer David Robinson, according to Reuters. Mr. Robinson said an anonymous filmmaker had put together outtakes from three earlier Chaplin pictures — “His New Profession” (1914), “A Jitney Elopement” (1915) and “The Tramp” (1915) — and included sequences of stop-motion animation and other effects. Chaplin was not involved in the production of “Zepped,” but famously satirized Adolf Hitler in the 1940 movie “The Great Dictator.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/chaplin-film-fails-to-fetch-a-buyer-at-auction/
