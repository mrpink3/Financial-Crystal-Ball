Her eyes, emotional and direct, are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze-block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica. Smith, 31, made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures, a technique which evokes both the coming-of-age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat. “It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one,” Smith says of his images, as he walks toward the sole window in the work space, located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City, Missouri, where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute. Pinned to the white walls, and still in progress, are four of his signature “picotages” — his word for inkjet pigment prints layered with ornate architectural elements and mounted on museum board — which will go on display on April 4 as part of “Junction,” his first solo exhibition with the Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/t-magazine/paul-anthony-smith-art.html

This latest restaurant fills a brick-walled space. Up half a flight of stairs, there’s a Corian and stainless-steel kitchen and serving island. “It’s the stage in the middle,” Mr. Techakraisri said. Along one side of the island, the kitchen prepares sandwiches by day, and dinner entrees in the evening. All feature a choice of beef, turkey, salmon, pork or falafel. The food is high quality and well prepared, though the entrees could use better presentation than a cardboard tub. On the opposite side of the “stage” is a coffee bar and an area with pastries that becomes a wine and cheese bar in the evening. Tables line the perimeter of the space; there is no waiter service.

2019-04-09,How to Laugh at Yourself,"“Laughing at yourself is one of the hardest humor skills,” says Jennifer Hofmann, a researcher at the University of Zurich who studies laughter and emotional expression. How easily you can do so will depend in part on your disposition. If you tend to be dour, you can learn to be funnier with practice. (Or don’t — and risk developing what one humor scientist has termed “terminal seriousness.”) In one of Hofmann’s studies, subjects underwent two months of a well-known seven-step humor training program. Laughing at yourself was the penultimate step (what Hofmann calls “Olympic level” humor). Before trying it, first figure out what you think is funny and surround yourself with more of it. When it’s time to laugh at yourself, be prepared for an unpleasant task: You need to list the things you don’t like about yourself — maybe you’re insecure about your body or dislike your lisp. Arrange the list from least sensitive to most, then read it to someone before you start cracking jokes (researchers believe this vulnerability exercise greases the wheels for future levity). Next, come up with a few self-referential jokes about the less weighty stuff and eventually work your way up to the more painful things. “Strategically desensitize yourself,” Hofmann says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/magazine/how-to-laugh-at-yourself.html

2019-04-10,Songs for America in 2024,"“Literature, be it in the form of a play or poem or novel, is often at its most captivating when it is at its most exaggerated, when it articulates our collective fears or concerns,” writes Hanya Yanagihara in her editor’s letter for T’s Culture issue, which comprises 15 original plays that imagine our country five years into the future. The same could be said of music. In uncertain times, it is often musicians who are quickest and best able to express our underlying anxieties, and their work is stronger for it. Accordingly, we asked four artists, Stephen Malkmus, Kelsey Lu, Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Meg Baird to write and record original songs that meditate on the theme of America in 2024. Each artist took this prompt in a different direction. From the distorted techno of Malkmus’s track “Airplane Air,” which he envisages as something that might, in the future, be played “on pirate radio in a police state,” to the mournful psych-rock strains of Baird’s song “1,000 Goodbyes x 100 Hellos,” in which she asks, in her words, “whether we can trade our collective environmental, social and economic anxieties for action,” listen to the four tracks below.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/t-magazine/stephen-malkmus-bonnie-prince-billy-playlist.html

Nell Freudenberger’s novel “Lost and Wanted,” which views a remembered friendship through the lens of science. In “Women’s Work,” Megan K. Stack turns the microscope on herself, and her class privilege, to explore her relationship to the women she hired as domestic help when she lived overseas. There’s also Leo Damrosch’s great group biography of the Club — the 18th-century British intellectuals who met weekly for food, drink and conversation that nurtured their creative genius. (They saved it for more exciting things than their club’s name.)

2019-04-15,What I Learned on My Vacation to Westeros,"The first time I saw a map of Westeros, I was struck by how much it looked like an inverted map of Ireland. There were some differences, of course. Size, for one thing: Westeros is a sprawling continent, whereas the entire island of Ireland could fit snugly inside the state of Indiana. And the northern part of Westeros looked as if Britain had been clumsily grafted onto it. There was also the fact that Westeros did not technically exist — that it emerged fully formed in the mid-1990s out of the volcanic imagination of the American fantasy writer George R.R. Martin — and that Ireland and Britain technically did, though their borders persisted in a state of ontological flux. My curiosity about this cartographic relationship led me to enter the terms “Ireland Westeros map” into Google, where I learned that my observation was not an original one. Martin himself had confirmed as much in an interview at Comic-Con in 2014. “Westeros began,” he said, “as upside-down Ireland.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/magazine/game-of-thrones-northern-ireland-brexit.html

That’s in large part because, during those same decades, West Germany had undertaken a self-administered “Vergangenheitsbewältigung,” a mouthful of a German word that translates as something like “the overcoming of the past,” and refers to the country’s collective effort to grapple with the causes and legacies of the Nazi era.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/opinion/germany-nazis.html

She is now 102 years old and has very few visitors. There’s a new collection of her top recipes assembled from her many cookbooks, with her blessing. Not just the pecan squares, but also some of my favorites like the East 62nd Street lemon cake, Countess Toulouse-Lautrec’s French chocolate cake and rugelach.

Toward the rear of the shop is Huso, a 12-seat restaurant named for beluga (in Latin, huso huso), where the chef, Buddha Lo, an Australian who worked at Eleven Madison Park, prepares an all-day menu of small plates, like king crab with caviar in a lobster bun, Wagyu tartare with caviar, and caviar samplers with blini and buttery madeleines. In the evenings, starting next week, a multicourse tasting menu, $200, will be available. Marky’s is the work of Mark Zaslavsky and Mark Gelman, who started selling seafood, caviar and other imported specialties wholesale and retail, and opened a shop in Miami in 1983. By the late 1990s, they anticipated the restrictions on caviar from wild sturgeon that are now in place and set up an aquaculture operation dedicated to several species of sturgeon, including beluga, in northern Florida. This fall at their Sturgeon Aquafarms, they expect to be able to start producing beluga, for which they hold a government license and international certification.

Not to mention the ever-growing, ever-more-elaborate involvement of the world’s biggest fashion brands, which this year included Tod’s — the company presented full-size yurts, huts and other archetypal shelters reimagined by the architect Andrea Caputo — and Louis Vuitton, who debuted the latest collection from its Objets Nomades series of travel-inspired furnishings.

2019-04-17,A Painter Who Left the Art World in Order to Actually Make Art,"WHEN VIVIAN SUTER arrived at the lake in the early 1980s, it took her three days to summon the courage to look at it. At the time, the Swiss-Argentine artist was in her early 30s and recently divorced. She had spent the previous few months driving through Central America on a solitary tour of Mesoamerican ruins. In Guatemala, where she’d come to see the Mayan Tikal architectural site, she arrived one night in a town on the outskirts of Lake Atitlán, which fills the crater of a volcano. Though she couldn’t see the lake, the thought of it unsettled her. “I was very emotional about the lake, and I didn’t dare to go and look at it,” she remembers, sitting in her garden on the northeastern side of Lake Atitlán, across from an imposing matapalo, or strangler fig. “I felt it would have an incredible attraction.

He envisioned it as a place where scientists would work in open, collaborative laboratories, free from university bureaucracies: They would be professors, supervising graduate students and postdocs, but with no teaching requirements. He recruited 10 of the top men in biology to join him, including Francis Crick, newly famous for discovering, with James Watson, DNA’s double helix.

2019-04-18,36 Hours in Mendocino County,"Ninety miles north of San Francisco, Mendocino County is just far enough away to have narrowly escaped the Bay Area’s radical transformation during the tech boom years. In contrast to other formerly quiet Northern California backwaters, Mendocino maintains its rural identity and eccentricities, including its longstanding status as one of the country’s major marijuana-producing regions. Where there is big news, it’s largely culinary. The 30-year-old chef at Elk’s Harbor House Inn was recently named a James Beard award semifinalist for Best Chef in the West. Besides the Harbor House’s eight- to 12-course, $150 per person prix fixe dinners, there are cheesemakers, upstart breweries, exceptional farm stands — notably Fort Bragg’s Nye Ranch and Caspar’s Fortunate Farm — and farm-inspired restaurants, like the long-awaited, soon-to-open Fog Eater Cafe, which began as a farm pop-up, and will serve “California cuisine with a Southern twang.” After years of population stagnation, young people are moving in, or coming home, and committing themselves to Mendocino’s fertile soil and sea.

The Instagram ideal beauty standard is embodied by Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner — a sexy baby meets Jessica Rabbit — and it falls a smidge to the right of the pit of the uncanny valley. As many devoted Instagram accounts reveal, it’s a look that takes a lot of cosmetic work and digital alteration to achieve.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/opinion/instagram-celebrity-plastic-surgery.html

The supermassive void at the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy is about as large as our solar system, with a mass outstripping the sun’s more than 6 billion times over, from which no light escapes. What the picture shows is the event horizon that surrounds it, an aureole of blazing fire; but the halo appears blurry and indistinct, and within seconds it had been repurposed for all manner of pathetic digital jokes.

Humans naturally do most of their breathing through their nasal passages, which serve to heat, humidify and filter the air. It’s not uncommon, though, to slip into a mouth-breathing habit. Test yourself by inhaling through your nostrils. If you can’t, you may have some kind of obstruction, and should go see an ear, nose and throat specialist. If you can but tend not to, you may be an accidental mouth breather.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/magazine/how-to-be-a-nose-breather.html

To watch her withstand the jeers of the boy-men in “Knocked Up,” the cave-manning of Gerard Butler in “The Ugly Truth” or the bridesmaid-outfit montage in “27 Dresses” was to witness a genre’s assault on one of its last dedicated practitioners. Heigl didn’t get to show the luminance, flintiness or idiosyncrasy of her romantic-comedy forebears; she was given too few moments of wit or insight. Instead, she was tough, stubborn, gainfully employed and — like most of the women in these movies, by that point — counterproductively heartless, tolerant of whatever partnership the plot backed her into. Her time as a romantic-comedy star was more a feat of survival than a cause for celebration. But as long as Heigl was around, so were romantic comedies, and that was something.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/magazine/romantic-comedy-movies.html

Yet ask any teenage boy what growing up is like, and he’ll likely give answers that are starkly different from the endless displays of male determination and domination we often see in entertainment. Rather, the process of growing up can make even the most confident of boys feel lost, aimless, confused and powerless. Three new Y.A. novels explore that tension, showcasing different tenors of young male vulnerability.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/books/review/ya-fiction-teenage-boys.html

2019-04-26,The Agony of Walter Benjamin,"“Uncertain Manifesto,” a recently translated book from the Swiss-French writer and artist Frédéric Pajak, is a hybrid, both in form and function. His black-and-white sketches illustrate a collection of stray thoughts — “snippets of adventure, random memories, maxims, ghosts, forgotten heroes, trees, the raging sea,” as he explains in his preface. But one recurring motif is the story of Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish philosopher and cultural critic who witnessed Europe being consumed by fascism. In Pajak’s drawings, Benjamin experiences the maddened crowds, exiles himself to Ibiza and then Paris, and eventually commits suicide during a failed escape from the Continent. In an email, Pajak explained his fascination with the philosopher: “The past has two faces: the past of the victors and the past of the vanquished, erased from history. But, history can only exist if the present repairs the trauma of the past. The injustice done to the victims of history must be repaired, even and especially if, as Benjamin wrote, ‘it is more difficult to honor the memory of the nameless than that of the known.’”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/books/review/frederic-pajak-uncertain-manifesto.html

2019-04-26,Spring Gallery Guide: Chelsea,"Art and real estate development met elsewhere in the city, but they got married in Chelsea. Tall, expensive buildings are rising around 10th Avenue, and gallery rents are rising along with them. Young art dealers arrive to try their hand in the official gallery neighborhood, and often fold-up shop quickly, as the promisingly offbeat American Medium, which started in Brooklyn, did recently. The juggernaut of mega-gallery showrooms continues, with behemoths like Hauser & Wirth mounting impressive historical shows (and starting their own bookstores, publishing houses, magazines and nonprofit foundations), and David Zwirner is planning a Renzo Piano-designed space to open in 2020. Meanwhile, the High Line looms ubiquitously overhead, like a people mover transporting tourists (mostly) from the new Hudson Yards on the north end to the gleaming Whitney Museum of American Art on the south. Contemporary art is everywhere though, including the High Line, where you’ll find a monumental sculpture by Simone Leigh, who just opened a show at the Guggenheim, along with other notable displays. Art has saturated the neighborhood, and you can see everything from work by emerging artists to the long deceased. Here are a few places to start.

Up here the big-ticket dealers in grand townhouses exhibit alongside younger galleries in walk-ups and outposts of international dealers; the last few years have welcomed Nara Roesler and Mendes Wood of São Paulo, Almine Rech of Paris, Simon Lee of London and Kurimanzutto of Mexico City.

2019-04-26,Spring Gallery Guide: Lower East Side,"The arc of the Lower East Side gallery scene bends toward youth. It is probably home to the greatest number of starting-out dealers showing the works of emerging artists in New York. This gives the art scene in this neighborhood and the ones developing around it — in NoHo, East Village South, Chinatown or Little Italy — a certain lightness of being.

2019-04-26,Spring Gallery Guide: Below and Above Canal Street,"“The art world should be understood as a complex ecology with many microclimates and some macro ones,” said the curator Okwui Enwezor, who died in March. He could have been describing the geography of New York City galleries. In the 1970s, the climates were macro and few (the Upper East Side, SoHo). In the 1980s, they were joined by the East Village; in the 1990s, by Chelsea; and in the 2000s, by the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. And there are spillovers everywhere. Today, it can be hard to tag a gallery by district, as I learned when visiting a handful that straddle either side of Canal Street, a cross-island axis that runs from SoHo to Chinatown, without claiming full allegiance to either.
