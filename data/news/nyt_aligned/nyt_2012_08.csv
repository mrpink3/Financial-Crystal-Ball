2012-08-02,Mexico: Former Defense Officials Are Accused of Aiding Traffickers," The former second-highest ranking secretary at the Defense Ministry and three other former officers have been formally charged with aiding drug traffickers, in the biggest military corruption case in recent years. Federal prosecutors announced the charges on Tuesday evening, confirming that the officers, who were initially detained in May, are accused of participating in trafficking with the Beltrán Leyva gang, which had been one of the biggest suppliers of cocaine to the United States. Its leader, Edgar Valdes Villareal, an American-born kingpin known as La Barbie, has been in custody since August 2010. Among the officers are Tomás Ángeles Dauahare, a retired army general who was the deputy defense secretary from 2006 to 2008 and had been seen as a rising star. His lawyer has denied the charges, and some commentators have suggested the case is politically motivated.

2012-08-02,Shoe News | Coccodrillo Comes to Verso,"Between the many talented designers who’ve sprung from its Royal Academy of Fine Arts and its refined retail scene, Antwerp qualifies as one of the most fashion-conscious cities in the world.

Coccodrillo is one of Europe’s most design-focused shoe shops (it even offers a yearly prize to a promising young student from the Academy); Verso, housed in a grand 16th-century town house, is one of the city’s most glamorous fashion boutiques. That they’ve come together makes for some of the best one-stop style shopping anywhere. “Until now Verso sold only shoes to the ready-to-wear customer to complete the outfit,” Geert Bruloot and Eddy Michiels, Coccodrillo’s founders, told The Moment via e-mail from Belgium. “We want to move towards a more independent shoe store.” Which means upping the ante on more adventurous designs: nestled among this fall’s lace pump by Dolce & Gabbana and glossy velvet slippers by Giuseppe Zanotti are curvy booties by the Turkish designer Burak Uyan.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/shoe-news-coccodrillo-comes-to-verso/

Last week’s opening of Eureka Beach on Main Street in Greenport will give the area a much-needed retail boost. The brainchild of the fashion designer Lucy Barnes, the television producer Heidi Kelso and the antiques dealer Fran Lombardi-Reilly, the shop reflects the trio’s personalities and specialties, with offerings ranging from new and vintage women’s clothing and accessories to children’s items and decorative accessories for the home. The opening also marks the debut of the Eureka Beach collection of caftans, tunics and dresses. “We created the line because while there are other things out there, they were just too expensive for what you’d get,” Kelso explains. “Ours are cotton, linen and silk pieces that aren’t too precious and aren’t too expensive.” The line, which ranges from $100 to $350, hangs alongside pieces by Barnes (look for the stretch denim “Miracle skirt”), jewelry by the North Fork weekender Paige Novick, Chascona bags by the stylist Karan Schijman, Riudavets summery leather slip-ons, children’s clothing by Wovenplay and textiles from Bali, Turkey and Morocco.

Best friends, Celeste and Jesse share the same adolescent humor, fondness for stupid voices and even property lines: a hard-driving trend forecaster, she lives in their house while he’s a laid-back artist who now flops in the backyard studio.

But she walked out of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” The sight of Marilyn as the diamond-obsessed showgirl Lorelei Lee, “huge as a colossus doll, mincing and whispering and simply hoping her way into total vulnerability,” enraged her.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/marilyn-by-lois-banner.html

2012-08-03,How My Grandmother Became Flush With Syrup,"When the Maxwells couldn’t pay up, they settled their account with maple syrup. They were customers of my grandparents’ heating-oil service in northern Vermont. My grandfather delivered the oil, and my grandmother kept the books; when he died, she was left to close out the business. This was the North Country around Lake Memphremagog, the last exit on I-91 before the Canadian border, where plenty of farmers and people who work in the woods come up short every month. Tapping sugar maples is a common way to supplement income, and this was the case with the Maxwells, who had a sizable outstanding bill when my grandfather died. The Maxwells made a proposal: they would pay the balance over time in Vermont’s liquid gold.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/magazine/how-my-grandmother-became-flush-with-syrup.html
2012-08-03,Who Made Those Aviator Sunglasses?,"Early in the 20th century, as test pilots began flying higher than Mount Everest, they had to defend themselves against temperatures as low as minus-80 degrees Fahrenheit. To survive the frigid blast, aviators wore leather hoods, and they insulated their eyes with fur-lined goggles. To lift those goggles for even an instant was to risk death. In 1920, when Shorty Schroeder dared to take a biplane above 33,000 feet, his goggles fogged and he had no choice but to pull them off. Moments later, his vision blurred, and his eyes were soon frozen over.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/magazine/who-made-those-aviator-sunglasses.html

2012-08-03,Bobos in Paradise,"One view of the novel, the one that E. M. Forster advanced, says it’s “a fiction in prose of a certain extent” — meaning more than 50,000 words, in Forster’s opinion. By that definition Karl Taro Greenfeld’s “Triburbia” qualifies as a novel, which is what his publisher calls it, though I’d be inclined to call it linked stories. I suspect that if “Dubliners” had been published in recent years it would have been marketed as a novel. If Tom Rachman’s “Imperfectionists” and Jennifer Egan’s “Visit From the Goon Squad” are novels, if Flann O’Brien’s “At Swim-Two-Birds” is a novel, then so, perhaps, is “Triburbia.” It lacks the sense of closure and the linear narrative drive of more conventional examples of the form, but it’s an artful and casually cohesive work of fiction imbued with anthropological insight.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/triburbia-by-karl-taro-greenfeld.html

2012-08-03,Desert Vigil,"John Brandon’s unpretentious, deeply heartfelt voice speaks to, and for, a certain type of reader — one who’s inhaled the gateway drugs of Hogwarts and Katniss, and is ready for more adult pleasures. Centering on unmoored young men and women taking fraught voyages of self-discovery, Brandon’s first two novels — “Arkansas” and “Citrus County” — shuddered through strip-mall landscapes leafy with damaged adults, broken families, disintegrating plans and unrealized hopes. “Citrus County” was about the tentative love between a middle schoolboy and the girl whose younger sister that boy had kidnapped; its every page was bright with the detailed observations, aesthetic vision and moral complexities we look for in the big leagues of serious literature. Thus, like Salinger before him and contemporaries including Hannah Tinti, Tony Earley and Mark Haddon, Brandon is an author who expands the tent, delivering capital-letter good stuff to young readers and adults alike.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/a-million-heavens-by-john-brandon.html

His paradise is a mismanaged corporation, Heaven Inc. — full of departments like Prayer Intake and Geyser Regulation — whose chief executive, God, decides on a whim to retire, destroy Earth, kill all the humans (by fire or ice, he’s still deciding) and fulfill his lifelong dream of opening an Asian-­American fusion restaurant.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/what-in-gods-name-by-simon-rich.html

In a recent e-mail, he said of Obama: “If I could tell him just one thing, it would be to remind him that each of the last three presidents could have gone to jail in their youth for doing drugs that other Americans are still being punished for. Just getting caught smoking pot once can follow you around for the rest of your life, blocking career and even housing opportunities.

2012-08-03,Monique Péan’s New Pieces as Paintings,"After experimenting with photographs of fossilized ivory, acrylic paint, gesso and really big sheets of canvas, the jewelry designer Monique Péan is now painting, too. Her inspiration: the pieces in her most recent collection, called Sut’ana. “I’m just so fascinated by fossilized woolly mammoth and walrus ivory; no two pieces are the exact same,” says Péan about the thousands-of-years-old Peruvian treasures that star in Sut’ana. “I thought it would be exciting to magnify them, to show their intricate natural patterns.” And that she did. With the help of the photographer Marshall Troy, Péan put a selection of her jewelry — a necklace made of olive-tinted ivory and earrings made of cognac fossils, opals, black jade and diamonds, for example — under the camera lens to capture their constellation-like compositions. She then magnified and printed a total of five pictures onto large canvases that underwent a 72-hour Mark Rothko-like top coat of paint, to mimic the fossils’ reflective and translucent textures. “The human eye doesn’t necessarily recognize the natural beauty of the fossils within jewelry’s small scale,” Péan says. “There are many people that see different patterns in the paintings, and make guesses, like, ‘Are they bursts of sun?’ But once I show them the actual jewelry pieces, they completely understand.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/monique-peans-new-pieces-as-paintings/

2012-08-07,Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,"There’s some sadness in the story of the S.S. United States, which for a time in the 1950s and 1960s was the fastest and most advanced ocean liner ever built. It was the lifelong project of William Francis Gibbs, America’s preeminent naval architect, a self-taught engineer who, among his many other achievements, was instrumental in transforming a German liner captured during World War I into the Leviathan, the pride of America’s postwar passenger fleet. Then, during World War II, he pioneered a revolutionary process to construct the so-called Liberty Ships, which became symbols of America’s industrial might. All along, Gibbs nursed plans to build a revolutionary superliner. But his designs, hatched in his parents’ Philadelphia attic as early 1916, were not realized until 1952. Ten years after its christening, his transatlantic ship would prowl the icy North Atlantic as a kind of floating anachronism, jet planes having turned its record three-day, 10-hour crossing time into a sorry joke. Such is the sweep of “A Man and His Ship” (Simon & Schuster, $30) an absorbing, transporting new history by Steven Ujifusa, which coincides with a show about the S.S. United States now on view at the Forbes Gallery (through Oct. 20).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/between-the-devil-and-the-deep-blue-sea/

After consulting their pediatrician, a psychologist and parents of other gender-nonconforming children, they concluded that “the important thing was to teach him not to be ashamed of who he feels he is.” Thus, the purple-pink-and-yellow-striped dress he would be wearing that next morning.

Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer poisoned in London in 2006 with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium 210. The case soured relations between Britain and Russia, and the new development may put at risk recent improvements. At British inquests, judges replace coroners only in the most high-profile cases, like the inquiry into the death of Princess Diana. The hearings to be overseen by the judge, Sir Robert Owen, could provide the first opportunity in the case for witnesses to testify under oath. A procedural hearing is to be held next month. British prosecutors have accused another former K.G.B. officer, Andrei K. Lugovoi, of Mr. Litvinenko’s poisoning — a charge he denies — and are seeking his extradition, which Russia has refused. Mr. Litvinenko, who fled Russia in 2000, had secured British citizenship shortly before he died, and he accused Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, of responsibility for his poisoning.

2012-08-10,The Get | Asprey’s Wiltshire Clutch,"The London designer Katie Hillier virtually eats, breathes and sleeps accessories working at the helm of her fine jewelry line, Hillier, and as a consultant for Marc by Marc Jacobs and Victoria Beckham. Most recently she’s designed a 10-piece collection of handbags in collaboration with the British heritage brand Asprey (prices starting at $1,200). “I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” says Hillier, who studied up on Asprey classics like the Belgravia Darcy bag and the Mayfair clutch before putting pen to paper on the designs. “There are so many wonderful Asprey bags that are just perfect as they are,” she explains. So instead of updating or reinterpreting those, Hillier turned to archival gentlemen’s document holders for inspiration. Warm, sybaritic shades of sapphire, hazel and shiny licorice make the bags feel especially luxurious and modern. “For the palette I was very inspired by a walk through the woods in autumn,” Hillier says. A standout: this accordion clutch in bramble crocodile, part of the Wiltshire group that also features shoulder bags in skins like ostrich and python.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/the-get-aspreys-wiltshire-clutch/

Luckily, this veil of benign ignorance is being lifted as publishers in the United States introduce American readers to a new generation of hugely gifted French writers who are reworking the boundaries of fiction, memoir and history (Emmanuel Carrère, Laurent Binet, the American-born Jonathan Littell) or of high art and snuff lit (Michel Houelle­becq).

Called the Mansion of Happiness, it — like the New Game of Human Life, a somewhat less thrilling predecessor — was based on the idea that life is a voyage in which travelers are buffeted between vice and virtue. In 1843 an American edition was issued. It quickly caught on, selling 4,000 copies in 10 months. The “mansion” in question was a heavenly one, the final destination for the pious.

Wilson wrote of the contrast between East and West, and of feeling compelled to keep her religious beliefs secret. “In the West,” she observed, “anything that must be hidden is suspect; availability and honesty are interlinked. This clashes irreconcilably with Islam, . . . where the things that are most precious, most perfect and most holy are always hidden: the Kaaba, the faces of prophets and angels, a woman’s body, Heaven.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/books/review/alif-the-unseen-by-g-willow-wilson.html

He had spent many years producing copy for the glossy French magazine Elle and, then again, for mass-­readership newspapers. He sat on the editorial committee of Jean-Paul Sartre’s magazine Les Temps Modernes. He was handy with a film camera.

2012-08-10,Crime and Punishment,"In recent years, America has succumbed to a peculiar form of Shariah-phobia. According to this narrative, covert jihadis are working to usurp the law of the land and replace it with Islamic rule. A caliphate will rise on the ashes of the Constitution, Americans will be forced to pray in mosques and judges will mete out stonings and amputations. “Stealth jihadis use political, cultural, societal, religious, intellectual tools; violent jihadis use violence,” Newt Gingrich told the American Enterprise Institute in July 2010. “But in fact they’re both engaged in jihad, and they’re both seeking to impose the same end state, which is to replace Western civilization with a radical imposition of Shariah.” During the Republican presidential primaries, every candidate weighed in on the Shariah threat. In November 2010, Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional amendment banning the use of Islamic law in court. A federal appeals court blocked the amendment, but more than two dozen other states have considered legislation to restrict judges from consulting foreign and religious laws.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/books/review/heaven-on-earth-by-sadakat-kadri.html

In this cyborgian age, inanimate things take on a life of their own, endowed with properties that once upon a time distinguished people from things.

2012-08-10,Inside the List,"DARKNESS AND LIGHT: Some writers crave publicity, while the very hint of it makes others curl into a defensive ball like hedgehogs or pill bugs. M. L. Stedman — whose new novel, “The Light Between Oceans,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 — is a hedgehog. The book carries no author photograph, and only a brusque biography: “M. L. Stedman was born and raised in Western Australia and now lives in London. ‘The Light Between Oceans’ is her first novel. Go away.” (O.K., so I added the last sentence myself.) Stedman has mostly shunned press interviews as well — but not entirely, and because this is the age of the Internet it’s possible for a determined reader to track down a couple of profiles that ran in her native Australia this spring. They are, refreshingly, less about her personality than her novel, the story of a World War I veteran who moves with his wife to a remote island for work as a lighthouse keeper. “There is something that appeals to the human psyche about lighthouses because of their isolation,” Stedman told The Sydney Morning Herald in March. “Their presence offers up a marvelous set of dichotomies the human imagination likes to explore — darkness and light, safety and danger, stasis and movement, isolation and communication. The story throws up the role of isolation on morality — when you don’t see the impact of your actions. Perhaps it’s easier to fool yourself when you cannot see the face of those who are affected by what you do.” The article does offer a few glimpses of the private Stedman (the “M” stands for Margot, and she has worked as a lawyer), but for the most part she stands her ground with admirably Pynchonian resolve. “Details of my life won’t really shed light on the story,” she said. “I’d much rather let readers focus on the book and their own experience of it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Guera. The series is about South Dakota’s fictional Prairie Rose Indian Reservation and Dashiell Bad Horse, who left the reservation as a teenager and returns as an undercover agent for the F.B.I. He hopes to get enough evidence to bring down Lincoln Red Crow, a corrupt casino owner. This volume reprints issues No. 50-55. The series will end with issue No. 60, which goes on sale on Aug. 22. The final collected edition is scheduled for Oct. 31. It’s difficult to discuss the book without giving away plot points, but a couple of characters have major changes of heart that result in a dynamic shift in the power struggles. And, as always, there is a bounty of sex, violence and intrigue. “Scalped” has been a compelling read and the creators have developed rich characters, but it can be difficult to find an audience in the comic-book market place. Issue No. 59, which went on sale in June, had estimated sales of slightly more than 6,000 copies. The collected editions, at least, have done a little better: Volume Seven hit the Graphic Books Best Sellers list in March.

Ryan of Wisconsin over the weekend to be his running mate is being credited with shoring up Mr. Romney’s conservative bona fides — something his campaign would have known because conservative publications had been telling him through editorials that he should pick Mr. Ryan to shore up his conservative bona fides. The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal both wrote editorials promoting Mr. Ryan for the Republican ticket: The Journal’s editorial on Thursday (Why Not Paul Ryan?) and The Weekly Standard’s editorial dated Monday but online earlier (Go for the Gold, Mitt!). Perhaps this is the reason, Michael Barbaro writes, that Mr. Romney’s camp was eager to announce the day he made the decision, Aug. 1: “Mr. Romney is sensitive to the perception that he acts at the behest of the party’s right wing.

2012-08-13,Glow With the Flow,"First there was the raw food movement. Then came macrobiotics, followed by the all-mighty juice cleanse. The latest detox craze isn’t something you can ingest, but it has plenty of people drinking the proverbial Kool-Aid. A cardiovascular procedure called External Counter Pulsation therapy, cleared by the F.D.A. in 1987 for the treatment of angina, claims to stimulate and clear collaterals (small blood vessels) to bypass narrow or clogged arteries. During the procedure, a patient’s legs are strapped to an adjustable bed using pressurized cuffs hooked up to a heart monitor. The cuffs inflate and deflate in sync with the heartbeat, pumping blood upward, so it can oxygenate more rapidly and distribute with greater ease. Now rebranded as Pure Flow Pulsation at New York’s PureFlow, E.C.P. is being offered, under the guidance of the cardiologist Dr. Samir Shah, as a multipurpose remedy for everything from fatigue to weight gain. (Andrew Barile, PureFlow’s co-founder, says that a 45-minute session is the aerobic equivalent of a seven-and-a-half-mile walk.) Some New Yorkers are swearing by it. “At first I wasn’t convinced, but by the third session I noticed that, for the first time in 20 years, I was able to enjoy a full night’s sleep without interruption,” says Celeste Fierro, a restaurant and nightclub consultant.

Anyone who’s ventured below the fold probably also knows that he’s a social conservative: He opposes same-sex marriage and has said that he’s “as pro-life as a person gets,” which seems accurate since he’s the co-sponsor of a bill that would grant fetuses “all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.”",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/what-paul-ryan-doesnt-offer/
2012-08-13,The Sound of New York’s Skaters,"“None of us can skateboard. We just don’t have the coordination, I guess,” says Michael Ian Cummings, the lead singer for a band called, of all things, Skaters. “The name just reminds me of my youth and the way I felt listening to music and hanging out with my friends running around the city being a hooligan.” The self-invented, devil-may-care attitude that’s characterized both skate culture and the irreverent sound of so many New York bands (the Ramones and Suicide come to mind) has had a big influence on Skaters, who released their debut EP, “Schemers,” for free on the Web earlier this year. A rose-colored, wistful affection for the city is shared by the group’s three members — Cummings, Noah Rubin (drums) and Joshua Hubbard (guitar) — and can be heard loud and clear in songs like “Good Weird Woman,” with its subway-station-sounding saxophone, and “Are We Just Doomed?” a bittersweet account of leaving home and hardly sleeping, something any New York band worth its salt knows intimately. “I couldn’t imagine making or listening to this music in any other environment,” Cummings says. And even without the skateboards or skills, Skaters do look the part. Dressed in the British men’s-wear label Folk, as they were for their T photo shoot, there’s no covering up their romantically ragged edges.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/the-sound-of-new-yorks-skaters/

After curing the fish with salt from Guérande, France, Hansen sends it to some of London’s finest restaurants and markets.

So while watching the the Balmain fall 2012 collection unfurl it was easy to embroider a line between the elaborate, mosaic-style beading that the designer Olivier Rousteing dreamed up and the exquisitely embellished clothes worn by Lady Mary and company. The obvious parallels, of course, lie in the richness of the workmanship. But there are less evident similarities between the “Downton” costumes and Rousteing’s clothes, as well as those of Erdem Moralioglu, who embroidered lace onto rubber; Marios Schwab, who layered sequined gowns with chiffon; and Gucci, where the designer Frida Giannini sent out a cocktail dress dripping with coq feathers. These creations (and many others, every season) beg the inevitable question: How are they to be cleaned?

The absence of a replacement for Obamacare in the budget, for instance, doesn’t mean that Ryan hasn’t come out for such a replacement. (He has.)

This fall, the company is giving its women’s line a similar treatment. For the first limited-edition women’s collaboration, Olivia Kim, Opening Ceremony’s vice president of creative, and her pal Jen Brill, a brand ambassador for Chanel and creative consultant, have created a collection of shoes that can be worn from day to night. “Being able to run around the city comfortably and still look cute is always a challenge,” Brill says. “That was the starting point of the design process.” Both women grew up wearing Cole Haan shoes, and for inspiration they turned to looks from the company’s archive, like a leather fisherman sandal from the mid-1990s and a 1970s clog. The twist? “We wanted to use colors that were different from what you may expect traditionally from Cole Haan,” Kim says of their collection’s three styles: a strappy sandal ($528), an ankle-strap pump ($528) and an ankle boot ($548), all rendered in jewel-toned Italian suede. “We personally love rich, saturated colors,” added Kim, whose hair is sometimes frosted pink. (Brill’s signature is red lips.) The Chelsea collection will be available Sept. 10 at the Cole Haan SoHo store (128 Prince Street; 212-219-8240). Kim and Brill, meanwhile, are hard at work on their holiday line; they say to expect metallic pastels and plenty of flash.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/sole-sisters/
2012-08-16,36 Hours in Johannesburg,"TOURISTS who bypass Johannesburg and head straight to Cape Town or out on safari are missing one of Africa’s most thrilling metropolises. This former gold-rush town suffered in the aftermath of apartheid, but the revitalization that came with South Africa’s hosting of the soccer World Cup in 2010 has blossomed. With a major face-lift of the city’s infrastructure — including the two-year-old mass transit rail system, the Gautrain, which was completed in June — Johannesburg is showing off its virtues and overcoming its vices. Although crime in some precincts remains stubbornly high and a bit of caution is recommended, downtown Johannesburg is in the midst of a revival. Nowadays, young Johannesburgers from different backgrounds are working together to remake their city for the next generation, tapping into a wellspring of creative energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Parts of Johannesburg’s once-decrepit inner city have turned into a vital gathering place, including an old parking garage that now houses a food and fashion market, and a one-time alcohol warehouse that is today stocked with galleries and restaurants.

True, of those five “grateful”s two were of the “ungrateful” form — yet these were embedded in clauses like “I felt guilty because I felt like that meant I was ungrateful. . . .” So, as you can see, Watson is a young woman who wants it put firmly on the record that she understands human lives are shaken up in the snow globe of uncertainty, and that simply because she’s ended up being covered in golden flakes, she doesn’t take it as her due, oh, no.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/emma-watson-the-graduate.html

2012-08-17,Kerr Goes Kiwi,"Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn’t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. “Still, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,” Kerr recently reflected. “Ever since, I’ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/t-magazine/miranda-kerr-goes-kiwi.html

2012-08-17,Here if You Need Me,"There are two species of novelist: one writes as if the world is a known locale that requires dutiful reporting, the other as if the world has yet to be made. The former enjoys the complacency of the au courant and the lassitude of at-hand language, while the latter believes with Thoreau that “this world is but canvas to our imaginations,” that the only worthy assertion of imagination occurs by way of linguistic originality wed to intellect and emotional verity. You close “Don Quixote” and “Tristram Shandy,” “Middlemarch” and “Augie March,” and the cosmos takes on a coruscated import it rather lacked before, an “eternal and irrepressible freshness,” in Pound’s apt phrase. His definition of literature is among the best we have: “Language charged with meaning.” How charged was the last novel you read?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/inside-and-signs-and-wonders-by-alix-ohlin.html

2012-08-17,Eye Intensity,"‘I don’t have a signature style,” says Mark Carrasquillo, the makeup artist who created the dramatic eyes on these pages. “But I like to think I can do many things, from full drag to ‘scrubbed clean,’ and somehow make it look like my hand.” He may be versatile, but one thing that carries through all his work is sex appeal. “I’ve been accused of making girls look oversexed,” he admits. The sultry makeup he did here has a tough-girl edge. “I wanted to play with the idea of youth, which for me means a bare face with one statement, like a drawn-on eyebrow or a matte black eye. No foundation, no blush — just lots of attitude.” While lipstick is optional (“I don’t believe in the rule that says you shouldn’t wear a strong eye with a strong lip — it’s a good-taste trap”), great skin is imperative. Carrasquillo’s trade secret? A special arnica oil-based luminizer he whips up in his East Village kitchen. “Every model I use it on asks me to make some for them,” he says. “I won’t reveal all the ingredients, but it’s healing and leaves skin with a beautiful, glowing finish.” Maquillage magic can only do so much, though, he adds. “A woman can have incredible skin, but if she’s not happy in it, all the makeup in the world won’t help.

Heard is also a Guess model, whose va-va-voom looks and progressive views on sexuality — she spoke out on behalf of the L.G.B.T. community at a 2010 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation event — have earned her many a racy headline. Not that she’s noticed; Heard doesn’t read the gossips, anyway.

Thompson’s “The Rum Diary.”) In between movies, Heard, who has made trips to the Mexico border with Amnesty International, will work with the organization on a bilingual campaign to help raise awareness about current immigration policies. “It’ll be something we present both on a grass-roots level and a lobby level,” she says.

The ego — what we take to be our conscious, autonomous self — is ignorant to the agency of the id, and sees itself in the driver seat instead. Freud offers the following metaphor: the ego is like a man on horseback, struggling to contain the powerful beast beneath; to the extent that the ego succeeds in guiding this beast, it’s only by “transforming the id’s will into action as if it were its own.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/deluded-individualism/

There’s got to be some stripping down.” To media critics, Mr. Zakaria is an example of how the personal brand now trumps the institutional brand, even of important outlets like Time and CNN. Still, even a widely successful personal brand can be overextended.",Business Day,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/the-breakfast-meeting-restoring-the-zakaria-brand-and-profiting-in-textbooks/

But interestingly, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, shoppers are not likely to see higher prices for corn on the cob because sweet corn is not as vulnerable to drought conditions. Corn on the cob that is sold in supermarkets is an irrigated crop, like other vegetables and fruits grown on large farms. However, smaller farms that sell their produce at farmers’ markets in drought-stricken areas are having a difficult time with their yields, so you may see a spike in prices there.

And its developer, Andrew Zobler, the C.E.O. of Sydell Group (which owns the NoMad Hotel and brought the Ace Hotels to New York and Palm Springs), is betting that it’s a game changer in the hospitality business. He hired Roman & Williams, which designed the Ace New York, to create the interiors — colorful spaces, some with bunk beds, that look like a styled-out room at sleepaway camp. “Think seaside boathouse, lifeguard school, a homemade summer camp near the ocean,” says the designer Robin Standefer. Zobler, who traveled to hostels in the States and abroad and says he found that they “offered something lacking in many hotels — a culture where the guests were open to and often seeking out meaningful interactions with each other and where new friendships were being formed.” To that end, Freehand will have a vegetable garden, swimming pool, table tennis, bicycles and even art classes, as well as a restaurant and bar run by the folks behind local favorite Broken Shaker. And there will be towels, sheets, pillows and an amenity-stocked bathroom for every room — not always a given at hostels. As Standefer puts it, “it’s not a place with cheap beds to just crash in.” About 15 of the 60 rooms will be private (for one or two guests), while shared rooms will accommodate up to eight beds, with rates starting at about $50 for a bed in a shared room.

Defense lawyers had argued that the men were egged on by an informant and that recordings of their plot showed nothing more than old men bragging. Prosecutors said the men were members of a loose-knit militia group that had scouted federal buildings in Atlanta to attack and had planned to kill people. Judge Richard W. Story of Federal District Court said that while people have the right to talk about what they want, “when they start buying bombs and silencers, I’m sorry, we have crossed the line.” Lawyers for the men, Frederick Thomas, 73, and Dan Roberts, 68, said the sentence was part of a plea deal that includes 100 hours of community service. The other men charged, Ray Adams and Samuel Crump, both in their 60s, plan to go to trial. They are charged with conspiracy and attempting to make the poison ricin from castor beans.

2012-08-23,Shuck and Awe,"I don’t need to tell you that there are alternatives to eating corn straight from the cob: you’ve probably adored creamed corn for most of your life. (Possibly you’ve never made it from scratch, and if that’s the case, throw some kernels in a pan with some butter, and after a little while, add some cream along with seasoning. Heat. Eat.) But it’s equally probable that you haven’t done much else with corn kernels taken off the cob. This isn’t a revolutionary process (it’s as old as corn), nor is it difficult: Stand shucked corn upright in a bowl and use a paring knife to cut down along the kernels, as close to the cob as you can. Really dig that knife in — you want everything you can get from the cob. Corn kernels are a revelation, assuming, of course, that the corn is good to begin with. And right now, it should be (and it should be just fine raw, as it is in the first three of these ideas). So before corn costs $6 an ear next year, go for it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/magazine/12-recipes-for-corn-off-the-cob.html
2012-08-23,Venus and Serena Against the World,"There’s video that exists of Venus and Serena Williams playing tennis when they were kids — 8 and 7, respectively — in the late ’80s, on unshaded but otherwise decent-looking public courts in California. This is not one of the clips you’ve maybe seen, taken from various news segments, but an earlier, stranger video, made by their father and longtime coach, Richard Williams, as a kind of audition tape for the tennis-instructional guru Vic Braden, ostensibly requesting an invitation to Braden’s camp, although the real reason for it, you can’t help feel in watching, simply was to let Braden know that greatness had arrived in the world. Richard’s face in the film as he presents the girls to Braden seems, as it does so often, on the brink of laughter. This was in Compton, the low-income, gang-afflicted hub city outside Los Angeles, an area made infamous by many a rap song. Although they enjoyed about as stable an upbringing as you could have in Compton back then, its problems were no mere abstraction: they supposedly knew to lie down on the court when gunshots rang out in the park. And there’s a story that Richard, when asked what he would do if his daughters ever won a Grand Slam, said he would go back and try to help the Crips who sometimes looked out for the girls during their practice sessions. “Venus Williams Is Straight Outta Compton!” read an early promotional poster their father made, to post on telephone poles. He billed the two as celebrities before they were even famous. That was how you did it. Not fake it till you make it. You decided what you were. First you had the belief, and then you had the training. “Belief and training,” Venus told me a couple of weeks ago when I met with her in Cincinnati, where she and Serena were playing in a tournament just days after returning from the Olympics. “That was unconquerable.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/magazine/venus-and-serena-against-the-world.html

Two months earlier, McEnroe surprised the tennis world by reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon as a qualifier.

2012-08-23,A World at Your Fingertips,"If there’s one advantage the app revolution has brought to the book world, it’s that often unwieldy tomes like atlases can be transformed into vivid, dynamic programs that bring the world outside traditional books to life — through animation, music, photos, videos and more.

2012-08-23,School of Hard Knocks,"Most readers of The New York Times probably subscribe to what Paul Tough calls “the cognitive hypothesis”: the belief “that success today depends primarily on cognitive skills — the kind of intelligence that gets measured on I.Q. tests, including the abilities to recognize letters and words, to calculate, to detect patterns — and that the best way to develop these skills is to practice them as much as possible, beginning as early as possible.” In his new book, “How Children Succeed,” Tough sets out to replace this assumption with what might be called the character hypothesis: the notion that noncognitive skills, like persistence, self-control, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit and self-confidence, are more crucial than sheer brainpower to achieving success.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/how-children-succeed-by-paul-tough.html
2012-08-23,Grown-Up Angst,"Even when she was MOLLY RINGWALD, Molly Ringwald wasn’t content just being Molly Ringwald. In 1988 the teen idol reteamed with her “Pretty in Pink” co-star Andrew McCarthy for “Fresh Horses,” a talky drama about a tough, sullen Kentucky country girl who catches the eye of an engaged engineering student. For moviegoers who went in expecting the plucky high schooler she played in the earlier movie, or “Sixteen Candles,” “Fresh Horses” was a real downer. The group of much more popular friends to whom I recommended it abandoned me halfway through for “Ernest Saves Christmas” and never hung out with me again. I loved it, though — in part because you could see how hard Ringwald was working to be not just a teen-movie star but an actress. That she couldn’t yet pull it off made “Fresh Horses” poignant, and no less enjoyable — and as fans of the ABC Family series “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” know, in the end she has become an actress, and not a bad one at all.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/when-it-happens-to-you-by-molly-ringwald.html

On the long ride to catch the sunset from the dunes above Lake Michigan, I handed my restless 7-year-old nephew a book from my beach bag: Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Treasure Island.” Instantly and intently, he began reading aloud, propelled by the excitement of discovery. Later, back at the cottage, he asked, “Can I have my book now?” Guiltily, I told him he’d have to wait: I needed it for a story I was writing about “Treasure Island” and its new sequel, “Silver,” by the British poet Andrew Motion.

2012-08-23,Can You Keep a Secret?,"Unlike her Newbery Medal-­winning novel, “When You Reach Me,” in which time travel is the subtext to all the interwoven story lines, Rebecca Stead’s new book, “Liar & Spy,” is firmly grounded in the here and now. What the two do share is a mood of shimmery unrest. Part coming­-of-age tale, part mystery, “Liar & Spy” takes place in contemporary Brooklyn and revolves around a seventh-grade loner and misfit named Georges. Cast out of his own home after his father loses his job and the family sells their house to make ends meet — and cast off by his best friend in favor of the popular clique — Georges finds himself living in a new apartment building with a cast of eccentric neighbors. These include the similarly aged and oddly named Safer, the building’s resident dog walker as well as a budding spy; Safer’s candy-obsessed younger sister, Candy; and their bird-watching older brother, Pigeon.

2012-08-23,Hanging on Every Word,"It may be telling that “The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore,” a kind of totem to the unmatched joys of reading, appeared in two different screen adaptations before making the transition into print. Winning an Oscar earlier this year for best animated short after appearing, last summer, as a lauded animated app, William Joyce’s story of a natty Southern loner was a feat of digital imagination, a dazzlingly polished animation and a wordless tribute to a fading literary age. Now, realized at last as a children’s book, his tale gains elegance but loses depth. The print-edition “Morris Lessmore” is a stylishly paced, vividly illustrated parable for young readers, yet it somehow lacks the dreamy creativity of its animated precursors. Ultimately, Joyce’s book tells us something we may already suspect: that storytelling these days has a broader canvas than the hallowed space within the ­library doors.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore.html

2012-08-23,Aftermath,"Shortly after the 2002 release of “Big Mouth & Ugly Girl,” her first novel for young adults, Joyce Carol Oates noted in an interview that young adult fiction is “just stripped-down adult fiction with more dialogue and less description. In adult fiction you do things with language — for example, you might repeat certain adjectives for an atmospheric effect. In young adult fiction, that isn’t done, and the chapters tend to be shorter.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/novels-by-joyce-carol-oates-and-james-preller.html

The pressure to appear flawless and to fit in without ever breaking a sweat requires putting your best poker face forward while shoving the messiness of adolescence under the bed. Skipping meals?

2012-08-23,In the Shadow of War,"A convention of novels aimed at children in the middle-grade years holds that whatever problem a girl confronts, her parents will not be the ones to help. This often makes sense both psychologically and narratively. These are the years when children begin to differentiate themselves from their parents and learn to fight their own battles.

It features 18-karat solid gold monogrammable pendants, rings and cuff links — exquisite but very expensive expressions of quiet luxury. (Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Biel and Halle Berry are customers.) Enter Donnegan’s new Insignia collection: necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, cuff links and money clips, in all-silver and silver with 22-karat gold overlay for a sheen and weight that mimics, uncannily, their 18-karat solid gold counterparts. “New luxury should be about both high quality and accessibility,” Donnegan says. In other words, same dash, less cash. “The Insignia shopper is interested in collecting jewelry. She appreciates understated design details and loves owning pieces that reflect her personal identity.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/worth-its-weight-mannins-new-insignia-collection/

In these Victorian volumes, there was always a castle on a mountain in the middle of the city, which would be cut in half by a swan-dotted river, and ham- or mustard-colored houses. Cobbled streets led to squares with four-spout stone fountains.

I’ve written before about these endocrine disruptors, so called because they wreak havoc with the body’s endocrine system governing hormones. Now new research indicates that their effects may be passed down from generation to generation in humans. Using doses of the chemical BPA similar to what humans encounter, the study shows that exposure to the chemical in pregnant mice can affect the sociability of their children and their children’s children. This should be devastating for Big Chem, which has so far been able to block any meaningful national curbs on endocrine disruptors. This obviously isn’t regular fodder for op-ed columns, but it seems an issue of public health and public policy that deserves more attention. I’d welcome your comments on what should be done.

One of the biggest impediments to further growth is the pair of 100-year-old tunnels under the Hudson River — one going in each direction between New Jersey and New York City. The tunnels operate at capacity, creating a bottleneck that will only grow worse as the metropolitan area’s population grows. It’s obviously time for a new tunnel complex.

The cover of that issue — featuring the two heroes in flight canoodling — got comic book fans talking when it was released last week. Those strong reactions, good and bad, were exactly the goal of Geoff Johns, the writer of “Justice League,” and Jim Lee, the book’s artist. In 2011 Mr. Lee was named co-publisher at DC Comics along with Dan DiDio, and Mr. Johns was named chief creative officer of DC Entertainment. In an interview they said that the Superman-Wonder Woman romance had been one of the most exciting elements they had conceived of when DC’s heroes were given a reboot last fall. “When we thought about relaunching the entire DC universe, we considered not what we were going to remove, but what we could add to the mythology,” Mr. Lee said. Mr. Johns said the romance and how it affects the characters, their teammates and their supporting casts will affect the DC universe for years. Fans with longer memories will recall that in 1986, after a previous reboot, Superman and Wonder Woman had another flirtation but eventually decided they were not right for each other. That version of Superman eventually revealed his identity to Lois Lane. He proposed to her, and they were married. And that version of Wonder Woman later caught the eye of Aquaman and Batman.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/books/dc-comics-unveils-new-power-couple.html

A galette is a free-form pie, more rustic than a tart. Although they’re usually made with classic buttery pie dough or puff pastry, I’ve been working at developing a dough recipe that is delicate and tasty but not too rich. I decided that a yeasted dough could work, and came up with a formula that yields enough for two galettes but has only 60 grams of butter (about 4 tablespoons). The flavor is nutty and rich because of the whole-wheat flour, but the dough isn’t heavy. The trick is to roll it very thin, then freeze it right away so that it doesn’t continue to rise and become too bready, and also so that it’s easy to work with when you are ready to assemble the tart. The dough works beautifully for these free-form galettes.",Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/health/nutrition/dessert-galette-pastry.html

Major Hasan told his lawyers that he began growing a beard because of his Muslim faith. But the judge overseeing his pretrial hearings at Fort Hood said that Major Hasan was disrupting the proceedings and violating Army regulations, and that he would be forcibly shaved if he did not do so voluntarily. Major Hasan’s lawyers appealed, but on Monday the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces said that since the judge had not issued a definitive order for a forcible shaving, it was too early for them to decide. The court said that if such an order were issued, Major Hasan could appeal to a lower Army appeals court. But the court appeared to agree with Major Hasan’s lawyers on elements of the case, asking the judge to address, if an order for shaving was given, why a forcible shaving was the “least restrictive means” of intruding on his religious liberties. With the court’s stay on the proceedings lifted, neither a hearing date nor a trial date had yet been scheduled.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/us/texas-appeals-court-declines-to-rule-on-forced-shaving-of-defendant.html

Writing for the American Conservative, Jim Antle makes a plausible case that Paul has moved the Republican Party in his direction, and might move it further still: From the party-wide enthusiasm for critiques of the Federal Reserve to the reappearance of “bona-fide noninterventionists” in Republican House contests to the emergence of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul as a more mainstream advocate for his father’s ideas, Antle writes, “the rapid progress” of Paulism “in a short period of time is undeniable.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/is-ron-paul-winning-the-future/

Instead of the austere herbaceousness of a classic French dry vermouth, it has a mellower flavor, without being sweet. Though the company says it was designed to go with new American gins, it seems better suited for what is called a perfect manhattan, which is made with half sweet, half dry vermouth. It’s also elegant on its own, over ice. An aperitif wine called Petal and Thorn is pale rose, fragrant with orange blossom and mimosa up front, but grips with a bitter finish.

2012-08-29,Stone Links: Consider the Octopus,"Scientific American discusses the claim of a group of prominent researchers on consciousness recently convening at Cambridge: a neocortex is not a precondition of conscious experience. In fact, these researchers believe there are good reasons to suppose that the neural substrates of experiential states, and of emotive states as well, are present in creatures with brains structured very differently from our own. Most interestingly, even some invertebrates—specifically, octopuses—appear to show signs of being conscious. “That does not necessarily mean that you could have a distraught octopus or an elated cuttlefish on your hands,” Katherine Harmon writes. But it does mean we need to think of consciousness as being spread across a wide range of species, and being realizable by a number of different neurological structures.

2012-08-30,On Chris Christie’s “Flop”,"I wrote my Campaign Stops column today about Ann Romney’s convention speech, but I should say something about Chris Christie’s address, given how quickly it’s been branded as a solipsistic flop. There is, of course, no real way to disprove the conventional wisdom in a case like this: Nobody (to my knowledge) conducts insta-polls of the TV audience’s reaction to a keynote speech, so if the chattering and political classes agree that Christie laid an egg, then that’s how his remarks will be remembered. But it’s worth noting that the indictment against the New Jersey governor is … distinctly underwhelming. He stands accused of talking too much about himself and not enough about Mitt Romney (or maybe not enough about Barack Obama, depending on which critique you read), and generally of failing to deliver the kind of tour de force that reporters are accustomed to seeing in his YouTube clips. But as even the big Politico piece calling the speech a “flop” allows, the most famous keynotes — Mario Cuomo in 1984 and Barack Obama in 2004 — were less about touting the nominee than laying out a broader vision of what the party stood for, and that was pretty clearly what Christie was trying to do as well. And I don’t think he did it all that badly. He made conservatism seem attractive, caricatured liberalism effectively, recast Romney in his own truthtelling image without mentioning of the details that might complicate that recasting, and generally came across as what he is: A tough-talking, charismatic politician, and an effective spokesman for the G.O.P.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/on-chris-christies-flop/

His now famous Evil Pandas are made even cuter — if that’s possible — for the young and stylish with the addition of glasses, a book (how studious) and, of course, the French company’s signature cherries. Lest we forget, though, the bespectacled icons, which the fashion world fell in love with at the artist’s 2010 Palais de Tokyo show, aren’t there to just look adorable.

Like her other urban teardowns, “Portobello” and “Tigerlily’s Orchids,” THE ST. ZITA SOCIETY (Scribner, $26) takes up residence in a picturesque London street and ever so slowly and delicately eviscerates the pretentious upper-middle-class residents behind its pseudo-Georgian facades.

My aunt gave it to me (I am the oldest child in our family). The diary shows a side of my mother I’d never seen before — angry, fearful, self-recriminatory. It’s upsetting to read. I suspect that the steroidal medications she was taking may have influenced her feelings, because she was not an angry person. I have never told my four younger siblings of its existence, but now — 10 years later — I wonder if I made the right decision. Should I burn it?

Yet a rubber version of a Japanese sandal called the zori had become a popular item in U.S. drugstores. “Our women have commenced wearing thonged sandals,” Chaze announced, noting that “obscene picture-books” from Asia eroticized the feet. Japanese women, he believed, revealed themselves in the curl of their toes.

And who would want to remember the pre-“Thriller” days anyway, at least the stretch of months right before it was released, which were nasty ones for the music business? To paraphrase Don McLean’s “American Pie,” the year that “Thriller” came out, 1982, was the year the music almost died.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/magazine/thriller-and-the-lessons-of-the-mega-super-album.html

Mitt Romney — private-sector multimillionaire, former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate — remains an enigma to many Americans.

2012-08-31,Patriotism and Poultry,"Christopher Hitchens’s introduction to George Orwell’s “Diaries,” among the last things he wrote before his death, is meant as a tribute to one of the writers he most admired, but it can also be taken as a warning. “Read with care, these diaries . . . can greatly enrich our understanding of how Orwell transmitted the raw material of everyday experience into some of his best-known novels and polemics.” Read with care? What is Hitchens trying to tell us with that phrase? A few sentences later we have: “This diary is not by any means a ‘straight’ guide or a trove of clues and cross-references.” About the creative process that went into constructing one of the novels, Hitchens says Orwell “gives us little or no insight.” Most tellingly, he refers to the entries as “meticulous and occasionally laborious jottings.” Read with care, Hitchens’s introduction alerts Orwell devotees that they should not expect the same pleasures from this book that they get from other of his writings.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/george-orwells-diaries.html

During the years in which the novel unfolds, from 1936 to the beginning of the new millennium, being a New Yorker meant something specific and unfakable, and Mattison captures that essence of city life, beginning with how New Yorkers talked and then moving on to the small details that speak volumes, like this one, which comes at the beginning of the description of a dinner party: “They had no hall closet.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/when-we-argued-all-night-by-alice-mattison.html

Before setting out her case for an unexpected original behind the original, Frank catalogs Crusoe’s latter-day incarnations, which have included “a hero of Romantic individualism, of Victorian Empire or 20th-century capitalism, an explorer, an inventor, the embodiment of radical or conservative ideologies, an evangelist, a prophet of positive psychology and the gospel of prosperity, even an antihero.” Surveying this long and varied afterlife, she declares, “You name it and someone has probably thought and said Crusoe has been it.

No vivid colors. No sweeping borders. No topiary animals. No shooting fountains. No fun, it would seem. Still, the traditional Japanese garden, esoteric as it is, has an ancient and undeniable appeal. It’s about secrets, perspectives, initiation, memory and time. It may take ages for a Japanese garden to come to maturity, to say nothing of the gardener. And yet, for all its mystery, the Japanese garden reveals itself as a capacious symbol of the human soul, replete with exactly the kinds of “borrowed landscapes” we live with.

With his mournful, meditative new collection of stories, translated (like “The Reader”) by Carol Brown Janeway, Schlink comes closer than ever to putting the war behind him.

It sees the kind of steps required to potentially expand that 51 percent to, say, 53 percent as simply too risky – in a polarized country and with a restive base – for the Republican candidate to undertake. And if you accept those two premises, last night’s speech was well-conceived and well-delivered: It was a genuinely humanizing and even moving performance that addressed what’s been his biggest liability to date – his career at Bain Capital – head-on while otherwise supplying only the most general, non-threatening account of what a President Romney might actually do in office. If all Romney needs to do to win in November is be an acceptable alternative for a weary and disappointed electorate, then this performance helped him clear that bar.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/romneys-speech-and-obamas-opportunity/

2012-08-31,The Divided Capital,"Though Civil War Washington was the capital of the Union, its population was dangerously split between Northern and Southern sympathizers. Pro-South feelings ran strongest in the Georgetown section. Started as a tobacco port in 1751, Georgetown, long a separate city within the District of Columbia, was dominated by a few leading families, who ran their corner of Washington like royalty. The Peter family was one. Robert Peter had been first mayor of Georgetown; Martha Washington’s granddaughter had married his son. When the Civil War came, two of the Peter sons joined the Confederate Army. To the everlasting sorrow and resentment of the family, they were hanged as spies after being captured in civilian clothes by Union troops in Virginia.

As a former participant on similar programs, I suspect not. Equipped with a tour guide and camera, travelers become poverty tourists, observing locals through an invisible but palpable barrier.

2012-09-03,An Unblinking Eye on the New West,"What separates art from politics is that in art, one can simultaneously occupy several positions, sometimes successfully.

You can see this tension running throughout “Robert Adams: The Place We Live, a Retrospective Selection of Photographs,” an exhibition of over 200 photographs at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/nyregion/a-review-of-robert-adams-the-place-we-live-in-new-haven.html

2012-09-03,Telluride Film Festival: A Sneak Peek at ‘Argo’,"TELLURIDE, Colo. — Telluride is not exactly a secret film festival— there are enough journalists and publicists here in the San Juan Mountains to get the word out to the masses below — but discretion is among the local traditions. According to custom, the lineup for the 39th edition of the festival was announced only Thursday, 24 hours before the first screenings, and as usual a number of spaces on the schedule were left mysterious, marked TBA. Some of those slots are reserved for “sneaks”—movies that pop into town like sudden thunderstorms — and rumors immediately began to fly about what special extras might be in store this year. Would Clint Eastwood (or at least his new movie, “Trouble With the Curve”) stop by on his way home from Tampa? Would we get a peek at “Cloud Atlas” or “The Master”?",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/telluride-film-festival-a-sneak-peek-at-argo/

The ex-boyfriend, Jose Orozco, a Mexican immigrant hired by Sheriff Babeu to run the Twitter account and the Web site for his Congressional campaign, also will not face charges over accusations that he improperly manipulated them. Mr. Orozco had accused Sheriff Babeu of threatening to deport him if he made their relationship public, but the authorities said the allegations could not be proved. Mr. Babeu dropped his bid for Congress and is running for re-election instead. He won the primary on Tuesday.

2012-09-03,Wyoming: Federal Protections End For Gray Wolves ,"Concluding a long effort to take the gray wolves in the Northern Rockies off the endangered species list, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service lifted protections for most Wyoming wolves on Friday. The move allows the increased hunting of wolves in Wyoming, where there are about 270 outside Yellowstone National Park. Protections have already been lifted in Montana and Idaho. Major environmental groups immediately protested the move and will most likely sue to block it. They have long maintained that without the protections, hunters and ranchers in the area will kill wolves indiscriminately and ruin one of conservation’s biggest success stories. Ranchers argue that even if the overall cost of wolf attacks on cattle may be small, it can mean the difference between profit and loss in marginal operations.
