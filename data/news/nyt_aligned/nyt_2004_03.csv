Genetically modified seeds, first widely planted in 1996, contain trangenes from other organisms that convey specific advantages to mature plants -- the ability to resist herbicides, for instance. The acreage planted with genetically modified crops has exploded: a third of this country's corn by 2002 and three-quarters of its soybeans. Whatever you make of this trend -- and there are strong arguments on both sides -- one question it raises is whether genes from modified plants might somehow drift into unmodified ones. The answer is yes.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/01/opinion/keeping-seeds-safe.html

2004-03-01,Shattered Democracy in Haiti,"The forced resignation of Haiti's democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, yesterday morning followed three weeks of armed rebellion and increasingly open pressure from a Bush administration too willing to ignore democratic legitimacy in order to allow the removal of a leader it disliked and distrusted. President Bush moved quickly yesterday to dispatch a contingent of marines to serve as the core of an international peacekeeping force.

2004-03-02,Metro Briefing | New York: Albany: Assembly Approves Minimum Wage Plan,"The State Assembly approved a bill yesterday to gradually raise New York's minimum wage to more than $7 an hour by 2006, saying it would give workers more disposable income, help lift them out of poverty and energize the economy. By an unofficial 127-to-19 vote, the Assembly, which is led by Democrats, voted to raise the state's current $5.15-an-hour wage, the same as the federal minimum, to $6 an hour on Oct. 1; $6.75 an hour on July 1, 2005; and $7.10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2006. The minimum wage has not been increased in New York since March 2000. Twelve states, including many in the Northeast, have a minimum wage above the federal standard. The State Senate, which is led by Republicans, was reluctant to act, arguing that raising the wage would put New York at a disadvantage with other states' wages. But if the federal government does not act soon to raise the minimum wage nationally, ''then we will reassess things,'' said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who supports an increase. Al Baker (NYT)",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-albany-assembly-approves-minimum-wage-plan.html

2004-03-02,Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Newark: Postal Worker Gets Prison In Mail Theft,"A postal worker was sentenced yesterday to 20 months in prison after admitting that she stole blank checks from a bulk-mail sorting facility and sold them to an identity-theft ring. Bank checks and other items pass through the New Jersey International and Bulk Mail Center in Jersey City, where the employee, Eloise Smith, sorted them into mail bags. Authorities accused Ms. Smith, 48, of Jersey City, of selling the checks to an identity-theft ring led by Joe Nathan Levine for $20 a box. Impersonators, using identification that matched the checks, would then use them to buy goods at stores, the United States attorney's office said. Prosecutors said that about $134,000 was taken from the accounts of bank customers, mainly from Bergen County, from February to December 2000. Mr. Levine, 41, also of Jersey City, pleaded guilty in October to buying the stolen checks. He is to be sentenced on Monday.

The album, by Brian Burton, a Los Angeles D.J. who records as Danger Mouse, combines raps from Jay-Z's ''Black Album'' with re-mixed music from the Beatles' classic White Album. The protest's organizer, Nicholas Reville, a co-founder of the music industry watchdog group Downhill Battle, said the ''The Grey Album'' was downloaded more frequently than the best-selling album in America, Norah Jones's ''Feels Like Home,'' was purchased. At least 360,000 tracks from ''The Grey Album'' -- or 30,000 albums' worth (the album has 12 tracks) -- were downloaded from just 54 of the more than 150 Web sites taking part in the protest. Those 54 responded to an inquiry by The New York Times with data transfer documentation. Jeanne Meyer, an EMI spokeswoman, called the numbers ''irrelevant to the fact that we are asking those who have illegally made an unauthorized work available to stop doing it.'' Ms. Meyer declined to comment on whether EMI would pursue legal action against the Web sites.

2004-03-05,36 Hours | San Diego,"WITH 70 miles of sandy beaches matched by postcard-perfect weather and a laid-back atmosphere, San Diego is a destination for sun seekers the world over. But this Southern California city is not that one-dimensional: it also has history. Spanish explorers noted its natural harbor in 1542; in 1602 another expedition named it San Diego. It was finally colonized in the mid 1700's, making it the oldest port on the West Coast. In 1769, the Mission San Diego de Alcalá was the first of the 21 missions built by Spanish friars throughout the state. In modern times, the city has become closely associated with its naval station and home to such famous attractions as the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld. It also has a cultural centerpiece in Balboa Park, one of the country's best urban parks. The city, however, may be most famous for its glorious sunsets over the Pacific.

2004-03-08,Washington: Some Of My Favorite Things,"Whether in London, New York or Los Angeles, negative reactions to Washington are common: it's a one-horse town; it's a dangerous town; it's a boring town; it's a town, not a city. Even its citizens complain of it -- it's the sort of place where everyone affects to have landed by sheer accident -- although, in the wake of Sept. 11, a groundswell of affection and solidarity has arisen, a desire to defend the city, not just physically, but in emotional defiance of its cynical detractors. The inhabitants have come to remember that it is a city with its beauties (the cherry blossoms, in spring, around the reflecting pool; or the late sunlight upon the marble monuments) and its privileges (almost all the museums are free; the spectacle of politics is always near at hand), with amusements all its own. (Even the taxicabs are entertaining in their way: the supremely illogical zone system, which, instead of using meters, divides the city into payment sectors designed to make the politicians' commute cheap; the disconcerting oddity of multiple customers with multiple destinations, crammed into a single cab; and the eccentricity of the drivers, whose knowledge of the city may be tenuous at best, but whose interest in global politics is often passionate and voluble.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/07/magazine/washington-some-of-my-favorite-things.html

2004-03-08,Motel of the Mysteries,"Scattered clues situate Judson Mitcham's slender second novel in the mid-1990's, but SABBATH CREEK (University of Georgia, $22.95) is a transcendent coming-of-age story that feels unshackled to any particular time. Its sense of place, however, is pungently particular, infused with the surface languor and latent violence of the Deep South. Prompted by a black eye from her alcoholic husband, Charlene Pope embarks with her son, Lewis, on a road trip through southern Georgia, until their broken-down car forces them to establish temporary residence in the tiny town of Sabbath Creek. There, they become the sole guests in a motel run by a startlingly spry 93-year-old black man named Truman Stroud, whose scowls and gripes poorly disguise a playful prankishness. Thirteen-year-old Lewis, our sensitive narrator, spends his days ruminating, practicing his pitching technique and listening to Stroud's dubious yarns, as well as the old man's more reliable reminiscences of Jim Crow laws and Negro League baseball heroes. This spare, lovely novel, while generous in humor, is anchored by sorrow and interspersed with portents of tragedy. Especially poignant are Lewis's flashbacks to the tense dread of living at the whims of an alcoholic father. ''When he was like that,'' Lewis recalls, ''I didn't know how to stand, how to hold my face.'' Lewis observes everything with the alertness of someone who does not yet take common experiences, such as kissing and drunkenness, for granted; he never resorts to shorthand to convey them, but describes them with a scrupulous fidelity to his own perceptions.

2004-03-08,The Paranoid States of America,"Picking candidates for the Great American Novel may be a fool's game, but it's hard to resist. Though it's impossible to write a single book that sums up the experience of a nation that is, by definition, a grab bag of people each pursuing his or her own notion of freedom, sometimes a novel so perfectly captures a corner of it you recognize that you want to jump up and shout, ''This is it!'' Stephen Wright's undersung ''M31: A Family Romance'' is that sort of book. ''Unsung'' wouldn't be the right word, since the novel was well reviewed when it came out in 1988, but Wright has never quite had the readership he deserves. Perhaps he wavers too much between the standard categories.

It wasn't as if Florence didn't have artists enough of her own. The city was filled with the smell of paint and the scratch of ink on the contracts. There were times when you couldn't walk the streets for fear of falling into some pit or mire left by constant building. Anyone and everyone who had the money was eager to celebrate God and the Republic by creating opportunities for art. What I hear described even now as a golden age was then simply the fashion of the day. But I was young then and, like so many others, dazzled by the feast.

2004-03-08,'Europe Central'," William T. Vollmann's 12th book of fiction, ''Europe Central'' -- almost a novel in stories -- is his most welcoming work, possibly his best book. Vollmann has often been an off-putting writer, sometimes intentionally so. There is the seamy (and admittedly autobiographical) subject matter -- living with prostitutes, using drugs -- of too many early works, and also of his novel ''The Royal Family'' (2000). There is the remote North American history of the four published novels in his ''Seven Dreams'' series. And, of course, there is his vaunting ambition: since 1987 Vollmann has released 14 books, 20 if one counts as separate works the seven volumes of ''Rising Up and Rising Down'' (2003), his valiant attempt to comprehend worldwide violence.

Seven years later, the critic Kenneth Tynan called her ''the best journalist alive.'' Today, West, who was born in South London in 1892 and died in 1983, is a relative unknown, especially compared to a contemporary like Virginia Woolf. Part of the reason might be that the diversity of her writings has made her legacy difficult to categorize. She was a critic, novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, biographer, political reporter and a magnificent letter writer. Her greatest work, ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,'' is an epic mix of personal history, travel writing and political journalism about Yugoslavia; the book drew new attention in the early 1990's during the Yugoslav wars.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/07/theater/theater-excerpt-that-woman-rebecca-west-remembers.html

2004-03-08,All in Good Time," There's a photograph of me with the family dog, maud, a wire haired terrier who seems to be laughing, Maud sits to my right on the brick stairs leading up to our front door. The house on La Brea Terrace has been rented for a year. It's a snug little place with a front lawn and no backyard, atop La Brea, just a bit into the Hollywood Hills. It is December 7, 1941. In short pants, suspenders, a white short-sleeve shirt, and black high shoes, I look bathed and scrubbed for the Sunday to be. It is morning, perhaps ten. My father, ever the photographer, is taking his time. ""No, hold it right there. Hold it. Now. One more."" My face does not reflect irritation. That would come years later. In fact, I appear to be happy, smiling in the sunshine, with Maud, the ""smartest dog who ever lived""-my mother's view of Maud, always-right there next to me. The smartest dog, the smartest boy-me. The best movie, the most delicious piece of pie, the most succulent pear, the most wonderful, the most beautiful, the most thrilling, the greatest. Katherine Carrington Schwartz, a natural hyperbolist, was also inclined to the malaprop. ""My, how time passes so fly."" And always that strong clear speaking voice, with a song inside. Katherine had been an ingenue on the Broadway stage. Arthur Schwartz had spotted her in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Music in the Air singing ""I've Told Every Little Star"" to a young Walter Slezak. My father had attended the opening on election night 1932, a secondary event to FDR's first plurality but not secondary to the composer of ""Dancing in the Dark."" He sought out the ingenue almost before the curtain went down. I've occasionally imagined him, oh so eager, leaping upon the stage midway through the second act. ""Good evening, I'm Arthur Schwartz,"" he might have said. Katherine, still in character, might have attempted to incorporate him. ""Well, hello,"" she might have replied. ""We've all been waiting for you."" She might have extended her arm to the rest of the bewildered cast. The orchestra, trying to cover the disruption, would almost certainly have struck up ""The Song Is You,"" a ballad in the score, while Arthur was hustled away by stagehands, his friends and peers Kern and Hammerstein in the back of the theater, burying their faces in their hands.

2004-03-08,Jesus as Box-Office Superhero,"WHATEVER else you might say about it -- and there is very little, at this point, that has not been said -- ''The Passion of the Christ,'' both as a movie and as a cultural phenomenon, has battered an awful lot of conventional wisdom and wishful thinking, in Hollywood and elsewhere. The notion that an unstintingly violent, purposefully controversial film -- to say nothing of one without a word of English in the script or a major star in the cast -- could become a blockbuster almost defies belief. But ''The Passion,'' helped by the synergy between Mel Gibson's shrewd media-baiting and the media's eager swallowing of the bait, will in all likelihood, by the time you read this, have surpassed ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' as the highest-grossing foreign-language film ever released in the United States. On its opening day -- Ash Wednesday -- it came close to earning back its reported $30 million production costs, and by the end of its first weekend had easily passed the $125 million mark.

After the ship visited several docks, it was fumigated, and bubonic-plague-infested rats were discovered aboard. Health inspectors feared that some rats had gotten ashore and would spread their fleas to the local population, potentially infecting the city with the Black Death. A secret emergency program of rat-trapping and rodent autopsies was imposed for four months, before frightened health officials concluded that they had dodged a bullet, and ''the Wyoming matter'' was quietly closed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/07/magazine/l-rat-tales-641120.html

Witnesses at the scene said they saw a man wearing a knapsack take the money from a cardboard cash box and run down 86th Street.

Other traditions include dressing up and playing games, as dozens of children were doing at the synagogue yesterday afternoon.

In October, a lawyer for the woman, Judith Scruggs, complained that comments made by one juror, Vincent Giardina, after the verdict were grounds for a mistrial.

Daniel, who hanged himself in January 2002. Mr. Giardina denied making the comments. The judge, Stephen F. Frazzini of Superior Court, noted that the boy had been the victim of incessant bullying at school.

Officials from the United States, where the plane was registered, said they were also following the saga closely. The authorities in Equatorial Guinea claimed that the plane was part of coup attempt it has now thwarted by arresting 15 people they said were linked to a group of 64 detained in Zimbabwe. ''They were the advance party of that group,'' the information minister told Reuters. But the operator of the Boeing 727, Logo Logistics Ltd., said it was on an innocent mission to deliver security workers to mining companies in Congo and had stopped in Zimbabwe only to buy mining equipment. Charles Burrows, a senior executive, denied there was any connection to a coup. ''I haven't the foggiest idea of what they're talking about,'' he said.

Dr. Riker's scientific focus on the importance of the motor nerve terminal in the physiology and pharmacology of the neuromuscular junction was ahead of its time when he first began to publish in the 1950's and 60's. He will be remembered as a person of great warmth and sincerity and as a scientist, teacher, and humanist. Our sincere sympathy & condolences are extended to the Riker family.",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/10/classified/paid-notice-deaths-riker-walter-md.html

The leadership, Board of Trustees and staff of United Jewish Communities note with deep sorrow the loss of Peggy Tishman, an extraordinary and articulate advocate for the needs of the Jewish community. In addition to sixty years of inspired leadership and dedicated service to the Jewish community, Peggy had the unique distinction of being the first woman president of a major Jewish federation. Her compassion for the plight of needy elderly and the unselfish manner with which she opened her heart and home to those around her, set a standard of leadership that was unprecedented. Peggy served as the president of the UJA-Federation of New York from 1986-1989 through the merger, which established the organization. She helped found the Jewish Association for the Aged and developed an endowments program to secure the community's future. She served as a board member of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Home and Hospital, and as President of the Jewish Community Relations Council of NY. Peggy's contributions to the Jewish community were nationally recognized. Her tireless spirit, honesty and determination serve as a model of grace under pressure, the best in voluntary leadership. Her humanitarian spirit and ability to turn ideas into action will be sorely missed. To Peggy's daughter, Pat Hall, and to the entire Tishman Family, we extend our heartfelt condolences. May they all be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Robert Goldberg Chairman of the UJC Board Morton B. Plant Chairman of the Executive Committee Kathy Manning Treasurer Stephen H.

2004-03-10,"Paid Notice: Deaths   QUADROZZI, JOHN","QUADROZZI--John, born August 18, 1928, the son of a Blacksmith. Starting his life, he swung his father's hammer as he learned the trade of a steel man. Most noting his physical stature said he was the Man of Steel. His repertoire expanded to truck building and mechanics. However in 1964, John changed gears and became co-founder and President of Quadrozzi Concrete Corporation, a company now celebrating its 40th year anniversary as New York's oldest and most respected name in concrete. The company John sculpted from conception has become synonymous with quality. With his dedicated family at his side, John thrusted Quadrozzi into the major leagues with its first mammoth project, the Cross Bay Bridge -- gracefully swung across Jamaica Bay into the Rockaway's to John and his company's birthplace. John then swung Quadrozzi across the bay, as it increased its range and added multiple concrete plants throughout the boroughs. Now, as the industry - recognized pioneer and leader in high strength concrete, Quadrozzi Concrete supports the all-concrete Trump World Tower on Manhattan's 1st Avenue--standing virtuously as the tallest residential building in the world, and the AOL Time Warner building on Manhattan's Columbus Circle--the Making of a Landmark and single largest and most expensive private building project in North America's history. It is said that these two projects, requiring a consistent delivery of the highest strength concrete ever produced in the city, could not have been built if not for Quadrozzi. John's legacy continues as the company he created actively supplies Building 7 of the new World Trade Center. A philanthropist, John generously gave to all that asked--especially his hometown, the Rockaway's. He was a Rockaway Chamber of Commerce-Member of the Presidents Club and 3 times Man of the Year, Rockaway's Peninsula HospitalBoard Member, former President and Co-founder of the Association of NYC Concrete Producers and recipient of countless awards for his contribution to the industry. Loyal son of the late Costantino and surviving Catherine Quadrozzi. Beloved husband of Theresa Quadrozzi. Devoted father of their four daughters Juliana, Regina, Theresa, Catherine and their only son John, Jr. Cherished grandfather of their children Darien, Quinn, Leonor, Theresa and Isabella. John died Sunday, March 7, in the year 2004, one year after a long fight against multiple ailments. He defied medical science as he cheated death again and again. Those who said he was the Man of Steel were wrong, he was ''The Man of Concrete''--John Quadrozzi goes out a winner! Reposing at Denis S. O'Connor Funeral Home, 91-05 Beach Channel Dr, Rockaway Beach, NY. Visiting Wednesday 2pm-5pm & 7pm-10pm and Thursday 2pm-5pm & 6pm-10pm.

The new drink, Pepsi Edge, has 70 calories and 20 grams of sugar in each 12-ounce can. Food scientists reduced the drink's calorie and sugar count by using a combination of Splenda and high fructose corn syrup, the company said. The new soft drink is Pepsi's latest attempt to lure consumers back to colas. Pepsi said its new drink is aimed at health-conscious consumers who drink both regular and diet colas, but sometimes shun diet soft drinks because of their taste. Both Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes are exploring midcalorie soft drinks, industry analysts said.

At about 50 proof, it has less alcohol than vodka, whether on the rocks or in cocktails like the honeyed shochu at Sushi Samba, and the kumquat sour at Riingo, both in New York. The shochus at left, from Landmark Wines and Spirits, 167 West 23rd Street, range from $10.99 to $24.99 a bottle. I liked two made from barley, the fruity Iichiko and the citrusy Alakey.

2004-03-12,"36 Hours | Scottsdale, Ariz.","SCOTTSDALE has long had a reputation as a sunny haven for retirees and golf devotees. But in recent years, this city of 200,000 -- in one of the country's fastest-growing metropolitan regions -- has emerged as a hip destination for visitors seeking boutique hotels, trendy restaurants and luxurious spas that soothe both body and soul. The old Scottsdale still thrives, of course, with galleries, golf greens and shops devoted to haute couture, but it has undergone a sea change. The restaurateur Stephen P. Hanson recently opened the James Hotel, with sleek rooms, plasma television screens, an upscale restaurant and a fashionable bar. The two-year-old Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain has a window-wrapped restaurant and a luxurious spa with Zen overtones. The acclaimed Boulders Resort has added a Golden Door Spa, a sibling to the original in Escondido, Calif., and the venerated Marriott's Camelback Inn recently completed an $8 million renovation of its spa. The new Willow Stream spa at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess offers a cascading waterfall, meditation gardens and a eucalyptus steam room. Once a small farming community, Scottsdale retains the friendliness and slow pace of life in a small town -- perhaps because stress can't survive on a massage table, golf course or any place where the sun shines more than 330 days a year.

2004-03-15,National Briefing | West: California: State Sets Goal On Water Pollutant,"The state moved toward becoming the first to regulate a widespread rocket fuel contaminant, known as perchlorate, by setting a goal of 6 parts per billion for the chemical in drinking water. The federal Environmental Protection Agency, in 2002, issued a draft recommendation of 1 part per billion, but that figure is a matter of dispute among the E.P.A., the Department of Defense and NASA. The Pentagon, which is responsible for much of the perchlorate contamination found across the country, has argued for a standard of 200 parts per billion. Perchlorate affects the thyroid gland and has raised concerns among scientists for how it affects the development of infants and fetuses. Jennifer 8.

We are heading for the collection anchorage on the east side of the Bay of Suez, where ships gather to form the convoys that the Suez Canal Authority requires for passage in either direction. The chart shows twenty-nine spots in this marine parking lot, and Peter is hoping for one on the outside so we can make a quick getaway when entering the canal. We reach the bay right on schedule, with eleven hours to spare before the 0100 deadline that ships must meet to be included in the next morning's convoy, the only northbound transit of the day.

2004-03-15,Why She Went Home," At sixty-five, despite waning lung power, Leonard Milton Fine was still lead oboist of the Newark Symphony Orchestra. He was also one of few musicians in the troupe whom Newark's car thieves hadn't scared off from driving to work; he figured his 1986 Yugo hatchback wasn't tempting even for spare parts. On the evening of the NSO's season opener, he set off down the New Jersey Turnpike with a full car. Next to him in the front, a lugubrious cellist wearing loafers that looked like bedroom slippers stared blankly at the toxic plumage of two dozen industrial smokestacks, which was bleeding into a violet and gold sunset. In the back, Leonard's younger daughter, Phoebe, barely visible beneath a battered cello case covered with stickers from obscure music festivals, attempted to make conversation with the cellist's flute-playing wife, a dark-browed blonde who seemed to have memorized the seating chart of every musical ensemble in the tristate area. Phoebe's left ear was pinned against the neck of the case. As uncomfortable as she was, she considered herself lucky not to be sitting up front, in the death seat. Her father had the alarming habit of turning around while driving to talk to the passengers behind him. Earlier in the trip, while availing them of his many superlative buys on raingear at Burlington Coat Factory, he had narrowly avoided scaling the turnpike divide and then swerved into the middle lane, where he nearly got swiped by an eighteen-wheeler.

Bob can't stand it when Dr. Marvin escapes from New York for a monthlong vacation in New Hampshire, so he follows him up there. The movie occasionally has the uncomfortable feel of making fun of the mentally ill, but Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Murray are quite funny together, and Bob is a particularly out-landish example of the annoying-but-lovable-loser character that Mr. Murray has been perfecting since ''Saturday Night Live'' - Friday at 6:30 p.m. on Cinemax.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/tv/movies-critic-s-choice.html

2004-03-15,The Origins of the Final Solution," In a brief two years between the autumn of 1939 and the autumn of 1941, Nazi Jewish policy escalated rapidly from the prewar policy of forced emigration to the Final Solution as it is now understood-the systematic attempt to murder every last Jew within the German grasp. The mass murder of Soviet Jewry had already begun in the late summer of 1941, and only one-half year later the Nazi regime was ready to begin implementing this policy throughout the rest of its European empire and sphere of influence. The study of these 30 months-from September 1939 through March 1942-is crucial for understanding the genesis of the Final Solution and constitutes the core of this book. At this time the Nazi regime stood on the brink of a true watershed event in history. But why, after two millennia of Christian-Jewish antagonism and one millennium of a singular European anti-Semitism, did this watershed event occur in Germany in the middle of the 20th century?

He shared Kipling's belief that ""when young lips have drunk deep of the bitter waters of Hate, Suspicion, and Despair, all the Love in the world will not wholly take away that knowledge."" ""I had many disabilities,"" he wrote, looking back on his early days. ""I was small; I had endurance but little physical strength; I stammered; I was shy; I had poor health. I had no facility for games."" His miserable childhood left permanent scars, but provided rich material for the poignant, autobiographical Of Human Bondage and for the deeply moving Cakes and Ale. His stammer, a psychological and physical handicap, and his gradual awareness of his homosexuality made him furtive and secretive, and caused ""an instinctive shrinking from my fellow men that has made it difficult for me to enter into any familiarity with them."" A lifelong exile and wanderer, Maugham gave the impression of being icy, remote and arrogant. The love and affection, insight and sympathy that he repressed in everyday life were channeled into the creation of plays and stories. Maugham's teasing combination of passion and tenderness, coldness and cynicism was stamped on his life and work. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/books/chapters/somerset-maugham.html

In reality, the process is distorted by a number of factors that have more to do with parental involvement and luck than academic merit. Many students applying to elite universities have become expert at positioning themselves. They select classes, teachers and activities to strengthen their college applications. Their parents pay for tutors to improve their grades and their SAT scores, and they help with essays designed to impress college-admissions officers. All of this makes perfect sense for families who want the best for their children, but let's not pretend that abandoning preferences for legacies and minorities would result in students being selected solely on academic merit.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/magazine/l-the-pull-of-family-706205.html

2004-03-15,Many Ways to Wrap Your Head,"In HEADWRAPS: A Global Journey (PublicAffairs, $35), Georgia Scott explores a common practice that dates back to the initial recording of human history and remains prevalent throughout the world today. Packed with captivating photographs and enlightening details on the practices of covering the human head by the people of 32 countries on five continents, the book discusses the vagaries of head covering: though culturally specific, headwraps transcend the boundaries of sex (men and women use them) and social class. There are cultures and communities in which the use of headwraps hold religious and moral values, as for men and women in North Africa and the women of the former Soviet Republics; in others they are decorative and ceremonial, as in rural Thailand; and in yet others they are used to establish social status and rank, as with the male spiritual leaders and chiefs of northern Nigeria. Scott, a staff artist at The New York Times, does not always adequately document the ethnic diversity of many of the nations she covers; for example, in her discussion of Trinidad and Jamaica, she ignores the sizable groups of ethnic Asians and Europeans as well as the indigenous population, and focuses only on people of African descent. On the other hand, ''Headwraps'' does provide excellent documentation of the increased use of traditional headwraps in nontraditional places and for reasons other than tradition.

2004-03-15,The Coming of the Third Reich," Is it wrong to begin with Bismarck? On several levels, he was a key figure in the coming of the Third Reich. For one thing, the cult of his memory in the years after his death encouraged many Germans to long for the return of the strong leadership his name represented. For another, his actions and policies in the mid-to-late nineteenth century helped create an ominous legacy for the German future. Yet in many ways he was a complex and contradictory figure, as much European as German, as much modern as traditional. Here, too, his example pointed forwards to the tangled mixture of the new and the old that was so characteristic of the Third Reich. It is worth calling to mind that a mere fifty years separated Bismarck's foundation of the German Empire in 1871 from the electoral triumphs of the Nazis in 1930-32. That there was a connection between the two seems impossible to deny. It was here, rather than in the remote religious cultures and hierarchical polities of the Reformation or the 'Enlightened Absolutism' of the eighteenth century, that we find the first real moment in German history which it is possible to relate directly to the coming of the Third Reich in 1933.

They're nostalgia magnets, these pictures. We look at them and think, That was life. The hats, the crowds, the shows, the bars -- yes, here was life in the center of the city that was the center of the world. And as Times Square is in so many ways the incarnation of urban life itself, so nostalgia for Times Square is nostalgia for a lost idea of urbanness, or of urbanity -- for a time, before the advent of television and the suburbs, and before riots and drug wars, when everyone knew that city life was the best life of all.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/14/magazine/common-of-earthly-delights.html

One answer is that the traditionalist Catholic Gibson actually surrenders the heart of the traditional Catholic Passion: its mystery. He makes it easy for evangelicals to endorse his film by giving them a visually literalist Passion to go with their literalist reading of the Bible.

2004-03-15,MOZART BY ITS RIGHTFUL NAME,"A Mozart mystery has been solved at last. So says the musicologist Michael Lorenz, an expert on the Viennese music of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the proof of the pudding will be served on Thursday in Vienna when the pianist Robert Levin sits down to join Sir Roger Norrington and the Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart to play Mozart's piano concerto in E-flat (K. 271) for the first time under its proper name. For more than a century, Dr. Lorenz says, the identity of the French pianist for whom the young Mozart, above, wrote the piece has baffled Mozart scholars, and the work has been known as the ''Jeunehomme'' Concerto. Dr. Lorenz says that jeune homme, or young man, a reference to Mozart, was the name given to it by a pair of French scholars in a 1912 biography because they couldn't identify the woman for whom he actually wrote it. After that, he says, scholars refrained from further research. Mozart, in a letter to his father, Leopold, after finishing the concerto in January 1777, referred to the pianist as ''jenomy,'' and Leopold referred to her as ''Madame genomai.'' Dr. Lorenz says the mystery woman was actually Victoire Jenamy, a daughter of Jean George Noverre, a famous dancer who was one of Mozart's best friends. Dr. Lorenz says a bit of research in the City Archive of Vienna last year established that Victoire was an excellent pianist, and it was she who commissioned the concerto in Vienna in 1776.

Sue Lieberman, director of the W.W.F. species program, said the tiger could be saved if Indonesia enforced bans on poaching and trade in animal parts, and if international donors helped villagers find alternative means of earning a living.

The company plans to restate 2002 and 2001 results. The changes will cut sales in 2001 and 2003 and increase 2002's, Veritas said. The company said it expected to file its 2003 yearly report, which was due yesterday, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter. Veritas, which makes software that backs up and restores data on computer networks, said it wrongly deferred professional-services sales and improperly booked some estimated expenses. Last year, Veritas, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., restated results for 2000 and 2001 after finding other sales accounting mistakes. The first restatement last year fixed accounting for a barter deal with Time Warner. The second also resulted from exchanges of programs for advertising that were booked incorrectly in 2000, in deals the company said were unrelated to Time Warner. Shares of Veritas fell $1.87, or 6 percent, to $29.14.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/16/business/technology-briefing-software-veritas-to-restate-results-again.html

Weiner found that radios carried by school safety officers at 137 New York City high schools occasionally did not work, because of dead spots in the coverage area and equipment failures. For the study, Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and his staff spoke with security workers at 250 schools, with about half reporting problems with radios and 18 reporting they did not have enough radios, according to the report. Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne denied security officers lacked radios, and said Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly had previously appointed a group to resolve the problem of dead spots. Among other steps being taken, the School Safety Division is moving and will soon receive a new communications system, Mr. Browne said.

She served as an officer of The Women's Guild and was a leader of the Congregational Church in the Gardens' Sunday School. She worked on Wall Street beside her husband whose company was La Grange and Co., a member of the New York Stock Exchange. She leaves an incredible legacy: her sonin-law J. Howard Johnson and her grandchildren Grange (wife Susan) Grant, Brett and Heather (husband John Sargent). We are proud that Eileen met her greatgrandchildren Crawford and Schuyler Sargent and Garrett Johnson. Louise and her husband Buman added grandsons Ralph, Harold, Crawford and David Hitt. She loved us all. We will miss her forever. The family sends special thanks to her ''Angels''-Mary King, Peggy Hosty, Cathy Meehan and Nora Buckley--for their loving care and to Cathy Cooke for her devotion. Memorial service will be held on Monday, April 12th, at 11 AM at St. James Church, 865 Madison Ave., NY.

Mr. Morgenthau, in office since 1975, stopped short of advocating specific reforms to the drug laws that were enacted in the 1970's under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. But he said that in his experience, the laws that impose mandatory prison sentences for certain drug felonies could, at times, ''be unnecessarily harsh.'' He hailed a move yesterday by State Senator David A. Paterson, a Manhattan Democrat, to hold public hearings on proposals to change the laws, including greater sentencing discretion for judges.

2004-03-18,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Cisco Chief Says Dividend May Not Be First Priority,"Cisco Systems will probably pay a dividend at some point in the future, the company's chief executive, John Chambers, said yesterday, but he signaled that for now the company has different plans for deploying excess cash. Mr. Chambers, who is also Cisco's president, also discussed paying a dividend during the annual shareholders meeting of the company last November. But shareholders, he said at a conference yesterday, want Cisco to repurchase company stock, which may mean they view the shares as undervalued. Cisco can repurchase an additional $8.1 billion in stock under its current board-authorized buyback program. As of Jan. 24, Cisco had repurchased 735 million shares under that program, costing $11.9 billion, or $16.14 a share, a Cisco spokeswoman, Terry Anderson, said. Like many other high-tech companies, Cisco, a network equipment maker, has never paid a dividend. Microsoft was among the first to break that mold, starting payment of a dividend early last year. Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., has said it will not hire new employees until its current workers produce, on average, $700,000 a year in revenue. They produced $632,000 each during Cisco's fiscal second quarter, which ended Jan. 24.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/business/technology-briefing-hardware-cisco-chief-says-dividend-may-not-be-first-priority.html

2004-03-18,"Paid Notice: Deaths   JAICKS, DAVID P.","JAICKS--David P., 78, a pioneer in food processing and education activist, successfully introduced new technologies to the production and distribution of food processing for an ever larger population, and, among other community actions, was a leader in the integration of local schools in the 1960s and 1970s, died Monday at a nursing home in Ridgewood, NJ. The cause was complications from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Born in Lake Forest, IL, he entered the US Navy in 1943 at the age of 18. The Navy selected him for the V12 program for officer training. In 1945, while the war in the Pacific was still raging, he shipped out to Japan, arriving just after the second atomic bomb. His first task was to lead his men in the SEABEES in the clean-up and re-building of Nagasaki's infrastructure. After the War, Mr. Jaicks took his family to the East Coast to join American Home Products Corporation (now Wyeth) in their foods division. American Home Foods, makers of Chef-BoyAr-Dee, Gulden's Mustard, and Jiffy Pop-Corn, was just beginning to be an important company when he joined in 1964. In 1990 when he retired from the company as CEO and President of seven plants, he had introduced state of the art technology and a major R and D department run by scientists. Mr. Jaicks also led the movement to integrate both in his company and in the community. He campaigned successfully to join the Waldwick Board of Education, ultimately becoming president of the Board. Together with a small band of community activists, he canvassed door-to-door to win an election giving the community the funds to build a school. The Waldwick High School still stands as a monument to that Board. In the 1960s and the 1970s Mr. Jaicks worked tirelessly with Fair Housing and Ridgewood Association of Good Schools (RAGS) to move his new town, Ridgewood, away from de-facto segregation. He had a reputation for scrupulous fairness and for mentoring. ''He showed me that he had faith in me--he pushed me to broaden my expertise and my experiences in the company. Everyone loved him,'' Ken Martin, CFO of Wyeth Corporation, said yesterday. Not content with staying home as a retiree in the 1990s, Mr. Jaicks accepted lengthy tours of duty in Ukraine and Poland working as a volunteer for the Citizens Corps for Democracy and the International Executive Service Corps. Mr. Jaicks, who lived in Ridgewood, NJ with his wife, Nancy, is survived by her, by four sons, Bryan of Ridgewood, Andrew of Tucson, Perry of Mesa, AZ, Cameron of Vail, two stepsons, Raul Cintra-Leite of Saddle Brook, NJ and Alex Cintra-Leite of San Mateo, CA, and five grandchildren.

2004-03-19,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Hewlett Shareholders Want Options Expensed,"Shareholders of the Hewlett-Packard Company voted Wednesday to approve the expensing of stock options, in a setback for Carleton S. Fiorina, the chairwoman and chief executive officer. A nonbinding proposal from the Massachusetts Laborers' Pension Fund was approved by 1.21 billion shares, with 925 million against, according to a Webcast of the annual shareholder meeting in Houston. The board of directors, which had opposed the measure, will now study the issue, Ms. Fiorina said. She told shareholders that expensing options would put the company at a disadvantage when its results are compared with those of rivals. The Laborers fund, which owns 87,100 shares, said that not expensing options understates the cost of executive compensation and encourages management to foster short-term price appreciation rather than long-term goals, according to Hewlett-Packard's proxy. Shares of Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., fell 5 cents yesterday, to $22.07. If Hewlett-Packard had expensed options in its fiscal first quarter, it would have reported net income of $786 million, or 26 cents a share, rather than the $936 million, or 31 cents a share, it actually did report, according to a quarterly report filed by the company.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/business/technology-briefing-hardware-hewlett-shareholders-want-options-expensed.html

Although this life-shaping event placed many obstacles in Ira's path, he found ways to overcome or go around most of them. Despite his disability, he traveled, married his late wife Victoria; graduated from LIU with honors; worked to create and shape the first consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program in NY State; was an advocate for Non-Invasive Ventilation and other issues that affect severly disabled people; and he was able to create a life in the Roosevelt Island community after spending more that 21 years in a hospital. Ira is survived by his family & friends, that include Maria A. Manrique, a person who played a significant role in his life for more that 20 years; Ed Litcher who became more of a brother than a friend; Margo and John--friends who shared the 60's & the years beyond; Michael who gave good counsel, even when Ira didn't listen; his Personal Assistants Ibeth, Susana, Tamara and Ann; each member of his family that he was close to; and all of the physicians, advocates and fellow disabled persons with whom he worked with on the many projects he was devoted to. As a colleague and friend wrote upon hearing the news, ''we are all a little more alone now.''",Archives,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/classified/paid-notice-deaths-holland-ira-e.html

Stone, below, the director of the State Division of the Budget, said in a March 2 letter to a committee of state lawmakers working to reform New York's budget-making process. The bipartisan committee, with legislators from the Senate and Assembly, favors moving the start of the fiscal year to May 1 to, among other things, have more time to analyze the annual state budget. The state is likely to miss its budget deadline for the 20th consecutive year. Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Democratic co-chairman of the committee, said he believed that Gov. George E. Pataki would ''reconsider his position'' about a July 1 start date once the legislators finished their work and put forward a clear proposal urging a May 1 start. Mr. Farrell said he believed July 1 was too late because it would leave school districts and local governments waiting too long for information on state aid.

Its heyday was 150 years ago, when oil was discovered in the Kern River region, bringing wealth-seeking prospectors from all over the country and Europe. Now, this sprawling community (population 250,000) is a ghostly industrial town, a sleepy Nowheresville in which laborers who toil in the San Joaquin Valley farmbelt saunter around with unironic trucker caps perched high on their heads. The city's appeal isn't readily apparent; you have to dig deep into its native culture to discover how sui generis it truly is. It is the country music capital of the West Coast, for starters, and its polyglot culture (Spanish shepherds settled here in the early 1900's) has also made it the United States capital of Basque cuisine. In the spring and summer, it becomes a hub for outdoor types, with white-water rafting, bicycling and hiking in the nearby Sequoia Forest. As for tourist-friendly gentrification, forget it.

He was 75. A loving father and husband, a trusted advisor to many, a great sportsman and philanthropist, he had strength and good humor to the end and will be missed by all who knew him. Born June 8, 1928, the son of F. Skiddy von Stade and Kathryne Steele von Stade, he grew up with his seven brothers and sisters in Old Westbury, NY and Aiken, SC. He graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, NH, Amherst College and the University of Virginia Law School. While he practiced law at the outset of his career, he soon moved to Scudder, Stevens & Clark--an investment advisory firm, where he spent almost 40 years as a Partner and Managing Director. He served on the boards of the Saratoga Museum of Racing, Greenvale School and Piping Rock Club. For the last 10 years he served as President and then Chairman of the Board of the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. Under his leadership this remarkable institution made many outstanding changes that enhanced its reputation, its collections and its financial strength. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Marjorie Mueller von Stade, five children: Philip (Jr.) and MaryAnne von Stade, Robert and Elizabeth (Munson) von Stade, Richard and Kimberly von Stade, Kathryne and Brett Lewis, F. Skiddy (III) and Elizabeth von Stade; and nine grandchildren, the most recent having been joyfully introduced to him only a short time before his death. He is also survived by four siblings -- Frederick, John, Kathryne Krumpe and Nannie Ward. Friends may attend a memorial service Friday, April 30 at 11am in St. John's of Lattingtown with the Rev. Foster officiating. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, the family ask that gifts be made to the Shelburne Museum, P.O.

''Jersey Girl,'' by comparison, is a PG-13 film with a Hallmark Channel plot: a high-powered Manhattan music publicist abandons the city, and his career, to raise his daughter after his wife dies in the delivery room. In this case, Mr. Smith has shed the anti-establishment vibe of his earlier movies for what he calls the clichés of mainstream filmmaking.

But whatever the form supposedly used to be -- a historically simplistic melodrama brimming with offensive stereotypes, cardboard conflicts and wooden heroes and villains -- it hasn't been that way in a very long time. From John Ford's ''Searchers'' to Sam Peckinpah's ''Wild Bunch'' to (forgive me, film historians) Kevin Costner's ''Dances With Wolves,'' the western has been dismantled and demythologized almost since its beginning.

The big north-facing room where she worked smelled of cooking: of flour and the sweetness of apples, of a batch of sugar cookies and the sausage frying for the stuffing.

Hanson landed the contract even though Donald Kagan, the author of the definitive four-volume work on the same war, recently published a 500-page version intended for the general reader. This Peloponnesian mania is understandable among classicists; the war between Athens and Sparta tore the ancient world apart and was the chosen subject of one of the greatest early historians, Thucydides.

2004-03-22,Man Walks Into a Bookstore,"Ali Smith, whose novel ''Hotel World'' was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize, now brings us, in THE WHOLE STORY AND OTHER STORIES (Anchor, paper, $12), 12 new short stories with surprisingly long reach. ''Gothic,'' about the trouble a woman faces when dealing with the oddball clientele of the bookstore where she works, subtly links the woman's failed rebellion against the store's dress code to her inability to handle a self-promoting neo-Nazi author. Her growing intolerance -- she posts ''No Smoking'' signs in the employee lounge and looks forward to ejecting an eccentric shopper she'd previously tolerated -- raises issues of personal freedom and social responsibility with sly concision. In ''The Universal Story,'' set in another bookstore (Smith's writing often refers, in playfully self-referential ways, to books, myths and storytelling), a faded copy of ''The Great Gatsby'' serves as the fulcrum with which Smith lifts into view a quarter-century of small-town English life, beginning with an entomologically precise recitation of the life span of a fly that has landed on the book. Smith's perspicacity and humor give resonance to the hapless and slightly mad characters who populate these stories: a woman who falls in love with a tree; another pursued by an imaginary band of bagpipers; the one-armed leader of a gang that tries to rob a fast-food shop with gardening tools. ''The Heat of the Story,'' the volume's finest, is a droll and touching tale of three women who, on a cold night, keep one another warm with stories of childhood and love. It achieves grandeur with measured effects, astutely figurative language (the women, drunk, arrive exuding ''liquid happiness'') and a refreshing lack of cataclysm or melodrama.

His family moved to Connecticut where he attended Naugatuck High School excelling in literature, calculus, and sports, chiefly baseball. He later earned a BA from the University of Connecticut at Storrs. Mr. Cilo started his advertising career at McCann Erickson in New York City working in the mailroom in a graduate training program. His command of the English language, coupled with a brilliant creative mind, propelled his ascent through several agencies before landing him at the William Esty Agency (now Campbell Mithun Esty) from which he retired in 1992 as Executive VP, Creative Director. It was there that he helped create many of the most effective slogans and campaigns of the '70s and '80s for clients such as Datsun/ Nissan, Minolta, and MasterCard. Upon hearing of Mr. Cilo's death, Gordon Bushell, former Chairman/CEO, William Esty had this to say: ''A man with big, original ideas who could express them in unforgettable words, and presented all like nobody else could. A loved and respected leader.'' After retiring, Mr. Cilo continued his craft in the form of short stories and novels. He was working on his fourth novel at the time of his death.

2004-03-22,Get Out of my Namespace,"You don't own your name. Just ask any John Smith. Then again. . . . . The Seattle coffee company known as Starbucks owns its name and, maybe, a little more. It has sued to stop a pair of coffee shops in Shanghai from using the name xingbake. This is the age of globalization, after all. In Chinese, star = xing, and in a way Starbucks = Xingbake. ''We came first,'' Xingbake's general manager said. ''We can't lose.'' His name is Mao. .An Atlanta music writer known as bill wyman received a cease-and-desist letter from lawyers representing the former Rolling Stones bass player known as Bill Wyman: demanding, that is, that he ''cease and desist'' using his name. In responding, Bill Wyman No. 1 pointed out that Bill Wyman No. 2 had been born William George Perks. . The German car company known as Dr. Ing. h.c.F. Porsche AG has fought a series of battles to protect the name carrera. But another contender is a Swiss village, postal code 7122. ''The village Carrera existed prior to the Porsche trademark,'' Christoph Reuss of Switzerland wrote to Porsche's lawyers. ''Porsche's use of that name constitutes a misappropriation of the good will and reputation developed by the villagers of Carrera.'' He added, for good measure, ''The village emits much less noise and pollution than Porsche Carrera.'' He didn't mention that José Carreras, the opera singer, was embroiled in a name dispute of his own. The car company, meanwhile, also claims trademark ownership of the numerals 911. . A Canadian businessman known as Jeff Burgar, living in High Prairie, a small town in Alberta, owns lots of names in dot-com territory. He registered J.R.R. Tolkien's name as an Internet domain in 1996 and held on to jrrtolkien.com until this year, when a panel of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) took it away from him. The name Tolkien -- just the name, as distinct from the prose, stories, characters and ideas -- is big business.

The family lived in Florence until 1923 when she, her mother and her sister moved to Paris. There she met and, in 1927, married Julien Levy. They moved to New York that same year where they started, in 1931, the pioneering Julien Levy Gallery, showing contemporary photography, the Surrealists and later, the Neo-Romantics. After her divorce in 1942, she met and married in 1944 the Bauhaus painter, designer and architect Herbert Bayer. In 1946, they moved to Aspen, Colorado, where they were both closely involved with the development of Aspen as a ski resort and a cultural center. The Bayers moved to Montecito, California in 1974. After Bayer's death in 1985 she stayed on in Montecito, continuing to play an active part in the art world as she had done since her youth and managing the Bayer estate, the bulk of which she donated to the Denver Art Museum. She was devoted to, and actively furthered, the careers of both her husbands. A famed beauty, she was witty, intelligent, forthright and tremendously generous.

The Rod Rodgers Dance Company will pay tribute to his quiet legacy with ''Don't Tell Me Who I Am,'' a mini-retrospective that begins a four-day engagement on Thursday at La MaMa in the East Village. The program will include a new work by Sean Curran, a longtime friend, and an homage by Kayoko Sakoh, a company member.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/arts/dance-this-week-legacies-artists-who-escape-them-rod-rodgers-beyond-black.html

For many years, Mr. Connolly was one of the top intellectual property litigators in the country. Among the U.S. and international clients for whom he tried cases were Pfizer, General Foods, General Motors, Kodak, Scott Paper, Rohm & Haas, Siemens and North American Philips. Mr. Connolly was also a Director of the Sprague Electric Company in Williamstown, MA. He was one of the first Delaware members of the American College of Trial lawyers, an organization whose membership is limited to no more than one percent of the lawyers in each state. He tried many cases in the New York courts. His offices were located in Midtown Manhattan and he was a member of the Canadian Club of New York, located in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and the Metropolitan Club. Mr. Connolly was born in Boston, Mass. on November 8, 1905. He graduated from MIT in 1927 and Harvard Law School in 1930. Following law school, he worked for the Universal Oil Company in Chicago. He then came to Wilmington where he worked in the Patent Department of the Dupont Company. After eight years, he decided to found his own law firm. The small practice that he started is now the firm of Connolly, Bove, Lodge, and Hutz, with over eighty-five attorneys in Wilmington and Washington, D.C. His son Arthur G. Connolly, Jr. and his grandson, Arthur G. Connolly, III are partners in the firm. In 1926, Mr. Connolly was critically wounded in an accident that threatened his life. While working his way through college, he served as a Lieutenant in the Army Reserves. As he was instructing a training program at MIT, a recruit prematurely pulled the pin of a hand grenade, causing it to explode in Lt. Connolly's face. Doctors at Cambridge Hospital feared that Lt. Connolly would never regain his vision. After several months in the Intensive Care Unit, he had recovered completely. A long and active participant in charitable causes, Mr. Connolly served for twenty-five years as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Laffey-McHugh Foundation. He was also President of the Arguild Foundation, which he co-founded with his wife Gerardine. Some of Mr. Connollys happiest moments were spent on the shores of Sebago Lake in Maine, surrounded by members of his large and loving family. Five generations of his family had vacationed there for many decades. He was also a member of the Wilmington Country Club and the Union League Club of Chicago. Mr. Connolly was preceded in death in 1986 by his wife of almost fifty years, Gerardine Laffey Connolly. He is survived by his six children and their spouses: Arthur G. Jr and his wife, Joan of Wilmington; Dr. Ronald G. Connolly and his wife,Sieglinde, of Lafayette, CA; Dr. Christopher G. Connolly of Lexington, M A; Thomas A. Connolly and his wife, Nouchine, of New York City; Mary C. Braun and her husband, Wilson, of Wilmington; and Gerardine C. DiSabatino, and her husband, Andy, of Aspen, CO. He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren: Arthur G. Connolly, III; Amy C. Doherty, Michael M. Connolly, Gerardine A. Connolly, Ronald C. Connolly, Jr, Maria S. Connolly, Christina A. Connolly, Anna J. Connolly, Christopher B. Connolly, Lisa C. DiSabatino, Megan C.H. DiSabatino, Courtney C. Braun and Wilson J.C.

Dr. Maciag was a scientist of the highest distinction, with extraordinary intellect, keen insight and an artist's vision of how complex biological systems work. He made seminal contributions in angiogenesis. His discovery of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) led him to be the first to propagate human endothelial cells in vitro for long periods of time and to identify many genes for angiogenic behavior. The generation of scientists he mentored in the fields of angiogenesis, growth factor biology, proteases, cell growth and development were profoundly affected by his aggressive and fearless approach to science. Born in 1946 in Bayonne, NJ, he earned a B.A. from Rutgers University in 1968, and served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1969 to 1971. He earned his Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975 and did postdoctoral study there. Highlights from his career include appointment as Assistant Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School in 1980 and work as Head of the Department of Molecular Biology, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD with teaching at George Washington University. In 1997 he accepted the challenge to establish the Center for Molecular Medicine at Maine Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI). NIH recognized his success with an $11 million award for a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in angiogenesis. Dr. Maciag was Scientific Director of MMCRI and Presidential Professor of the Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine. He published over 150 scientific articles, earned many patents, and received numerous awards for his contributions to science. He was an accomplished artist whose interpretations of cellular function were featured on the covers of scientific journals. Tom is survived by his wife, Lorrie, and son, Andrei, of Freeport, ME, his parents, Edward and Agnes Maciag, and sister, Arlene Arzulowicz, of Sommerville, NJ.

On Sunday, a rip current killed an 82-year-old woman who jumped in the water off Palm Beach to help a friend who had been knocked down by a wave.

A 13-year-old boy disappeared Saturday in shallow water near Jacksonville and may have drowned. Rip currents are channels of water that can pull even strong swimmers into deep water.

The court cited a long line of precedents stating that in general, local governments are not liable for their employees' negligent conduct. The 7-to-0 decision dismissed the case of Ashley Harris, a Brooklyn girl, and a similar case filed by another child against Putnam County. Both of them had very high levels of lead in their blood. A city inspector found a lead hazard from the paint in Ashley's apartment. The inspector later said the landlord had fixed the problem and pronounced the apartment safe. But Ashley continued to suffer from lead poisoning, and after three years, an independent inspection showed that the danger in the apartment had not been corrected.

2004-03-29,Is There an Ethicist in the House?,"Like some election-cycle cicada, the House ethics committee has broken its long silence and begun making a bit of noise. It is taking notice of public pressure for an investigation of allegations that bribe offers and intimidation were part of the long night of Republican arm-twisting when the Medicare drug subsidy bill squeaked through Congress last year. Representative Nick Smith, a Michigan Republican, had angrily complained of ''$100,000-plus'' bribe offers and threats against his son's political career. He later backed off a bit, but a full investigation of the gamesmanship under way that night is clearly needed. Whether the ethics panel is up to the task remains doubtful. The committee has been more or less flat-lining for years, ever since the rules were changed in 1997 to block outside complaints about suspect members and questionable behavior.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/27/opinion/is-there-an-ethicist-in-the-house.html

The first surgery worked and Doris became pregnant, but three months along she had a miscarriage. The second and third surgeries had no effect at all. Neither did attempts at artificial insemination using her husband's sperm, not after the first insemination, nor the second, nor the third. Month after month after disappointing month, Doris Del-Zio, then approaching thirty, got her menstrual period, and each one was a stinging rebuke. Every period taunted her-no baby, no baby, no baby-forcing her to acknowledge that she still wasn't pregnant and probably never would be. Maybe she and John should have just left well enough alone.

Then I realized with almost a sharp physical pain that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were going to try to take advantage of this national tragedy to promote their agenda about Iraq. Since the beginning of the administration, indeed well before, they had been pressing for a war with Iraq. My friends in the Pentagon had been telling me that the word was we would be invading Iraq sometime in 2002. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/books/chapters/against-all-enemies.html

2004-03-29,Mayor With A Mission,"Jason West, the mayor of the little Hudson Valley village of New Paltz who married 25 gay couples last month before receiving a court injunction to stop, has been thinking about gay marriage for a long time. In fact, immediately after taking office last summer, the two things the 27-year-old asked his new village attorney to check on were, first, the state and local beaver trapping laws, since a dog had recently been caught and killed in a beaver trap on the old Bienstock property -- a huge New Paltz scandal that was soon labeled Beavergate; and second, whether a mayor could perform gay marriages. The attorney, Spencer McLaughlin, is a Republican legislator from Orange County and a former deputy executive director of the New York City Human Rights Commission under Ed Koch. That West would turn to a Republican for advice was a surprise to the people who thought the mayor, who was elected on the Green Party line, was a radical liberal activist about to turn the town into a socialist enclave. In his reply to West, McLaughlin noted that the law is unclear. ''That's because the laws were written around the late 19th century, and no one ever conceived of wanting to do this then,'' McLaughlin said recently. The attorney ended his memo to mayor saying, ''That's a very long-winded explanation of why you can't perform a same-sex marriage, but does not address the issue of whether you should or not.''",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/mayor-with-a-mission.html

2004-03-29,The Passions of the Repeat Viewers,"ON St. Patrick's Day, March 17, Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ'' was three weeks into its $300 million (and counting) run and still drawing a big enough crowd to make it the nation's top box-office draw. The film has generated passionate opinions -- among critics, who have not been kind to it, and among audience members, many of whom have been so moved by what they saw that they returned for second and third screenings. To find out why the controversial film is still attracting viewers at a point in its release when most other films have already tapered off, Alex Abramovich visited the AMC Empire 25 on West 42nd Street. Over the course of 16 screenings that day, 642 people had attended the film, resulting in $6,091 worth of tickets sales. Some members of the audience were out-of-towners who said they had waited to see it while vacationing in New York, and some were New Yorkers returning for repeat viewings. No one said they had come expressly for the gore, but most said that the violence was warranted by what they saw as the film's moral: that the degree of Christ's suffering was directly proportional to Christ's love for mankind. In some cases, at least, what the viewers had gotten out of the movie seemed to depend entirely on what they brought to it.

The important thing about the failure to find W.M.D.'s and the failure to pacify Iraq and the failure to protect the treasures, the infrastructure and the women of Iraq is that these failures were foreseen by many who opposed the war.

2004-03-29,A Raw Bar Renaissance in Boston,"THE seafood raw bar is a tradition that dates back to Colonial times in New England, yet this regional specialty never goes out of style. In Boston there are a number of institutions, like the Union Oyster House and Legal Sea Foods, that are renowned for their raw bar offerings. And at many of the city's most stylish restaurants, raw shellfish is a standard item. But in the past few years, there has been a flurry of raw bar openings. A few fit the classic formula, while others, run by Japanese chefs, add a new dimension to the New England raw bar concept.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/travel/choice-tables-a-raw-bar-renaissance-in-boston.html

2004-03-29,Uptown With Hirschfeld,"Mixing the contemporary with vintage nostalgia, HIRSCHFELD'S HARLEM (Glenn Young, $75) pairs Al Hirschfeld's Harlem drawings with commentary from a dizzying variety of African-American notables -- some intimately involved with Harlem, past and present, some not. Each is cleverly matched with a drawing. Representative Charles B. Rangel considers ''Sugar Hill Statesman''; the Rev. James A. Forbes discusses the preacher of ''Yeah, Men!''; Eartha Kitt celebrates ''Cocoa Venus,'' a smoldering odalisque. Drawings of Harlem's legendary dances show Hirschfeld's line at its greatest: the Lindy Hop and the Boogie-Woogie carry the book from its Harlem pages to ''Hirschfeld's Gallery of African American Legends,'' a sampling of illustrations from The New York Times. If this section is perhaps a victim of somewhat lazy editing (what, for instance, is Halle Berry accepting the Oscar doing in the middle of the introductory essay on the Harlem Renaissance?) the two halves are indeed linked -- for Hirschfeld, the great chronicler of theater, Harlem was but another stage. This goes some way toward explaining the inscrutably masked countenance that features on so many of the figures depicted. Many of the habitués of Hirschfeld's Harlem have no eyes -- that is to say, they can't look back. As has often been true, Harlem remains in the eye of the beholder.

Coatee's rhythmic reassurances of the Lord's (and her own rather more palpable) protection always sent me straight to dreamland. But after my mother finished her song, I'd lie awake for hours, imagining -- yearning for, really -- the party that was ''getting a glow on,'' and the ''singin''' that ''fills the air.'' By the time I'd gotten around to ''better save a chair,'' I had the whole scene in my head: a gilded ballroom chair waiting for me next to a dance floor on a wide green lawn. The orchestra would be playing, and I'd arrive, late, ''in the shank of the night/When the doin's are right,'' trailing a white mink stole behind me. All the women would have on diamonds and gardenias, and all the men would have already shed their white dinner jackets.

He taps furiously at his keyboard, moves the cursor to the offending word and deletes it, or else adds ''ing,'' turning the verb into a participle and his script into the strange shorthand that passes for English these days on cable news:",Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/style/news-reports-for-ultra-short-attentions.html

The city needed new transit networks to ease crowds on its clogged streets and to expand into open land to the north and south. Subways won out over elevated trains, and New Yorkers have been riding in a hole in the ground ever since. Here are some of the high points and low of a system riders love, hate and depend on every day.

2004-03-29,Live and Forget,"I got on the train to Madrid early that morning. I live in Alcalá de Henares, a town about 19 miles east of the city. It is famous for being the birthplace of Miguel de Cervantes. The trip takes an hour. I'm 28, and I work in a savings bank. My wife and I have a baby, so I'm often tired these days. As I sometimes do, I fell asleep in my seat. Suddenly I heard an explosion, and then, right away, another. When I opened my eyes, the world around me was bathed in white smoke. I was half asleep and half awake. It was a choking smoke, the kind produced by combustion. Just then I felt something hit me on the head and something else strike my back. I might have been in great pain, but I wasn't able to judge at that moment. All I could think about was escaping the smoke. Someone yelled out, ''Jump through the window!'' By great fortune, I was seated in the front of the train car, right next to a window. I didn't have to break it, because the glass had shattered. It took about 10 seconds for the smoke to clear. I could see three trains, the one I'd been riding in and two others. That was when I realized we had suffered a terrorist attack. My car, well, the windows and doors were gone. One train had the roof blown clear off of it. The next one had been gnarled into a twisted circle. It didn't seem to have a roof. At that point, those of us who could -- three men and I -- jumped back into our car to see if we could do something for the people inside.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/lives-live-and-forget.html

''Sadie,'' for instance, starts with some plinka-plinka harp and Ms. Newsom braying the title, but soon things have gotten a bit more complicated and a lot more ominous: ''I call to you, but the water got so cold/ And you do lose what you don't hold.''",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/arts/music-playlist-david-bowie-spike-jonze-and-a-board.html

2004-03-29,Coach Fitz's Management Theory,"When I was 12, I thought that when The New Orleans Times-Picayune wrote about the ''struggle for control of the West Bank,'' it meant the other side of the Mississippi River. I thought that my shiny gold velour pants actually looked good. I kept a giant sack of Nabisco chocolate-chip cookies under my bed so that they might be available in an emergency -- a flood, say, or a hurricane -- that made it harder to get to the grocery store. From the safe distance of 43, ''12'' looks less an age than a disease, and for the most part, I've been able to forget all about it -- not the events and the people, but the feelings that gave them meaning. But there are exceptions. A few people, and a few experiences, simply refuse to be trivialized by time. There are teachers with a rare ability to enter a child's mind; it's as if their ability to get there at all gives them the right to stay forever. I once had such a teacher. His name was Billy Fitzgerald, but everybody just called him Coach Fitz.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/coach-fitz-s-management-theory.html

2004-03-29,City Boy," They had a bad neighbor. Bad in all the usual ways, and difficult to ignore. Music, noise on the stairs, carelessness about the disposal of garbage. Above their heads, he carried on wrestling matches with the furniture. His uncarpeted floors were a soundstage. He dropped and bumped and scraped. Jack and Chloe called him Hippie Pothead Rasta Boy, or sometimes just H.P.R.B. Being witty made them feel better, although not for long. Pot smoke wafted down to them along with other alarming vegetarian burnt smells, brown rice flambé or tofu gone wrong. A perpetual low-grade party reigned upstairs. There were muffled shrieks, more of the furniture wrestling, comings and goings late at night. When, after a time, they complained, they got nowhere. The kid was too stoned, his life already too full of mess and distraction for anything they said to register. The landlord was no help, nor were the police, unless they wanted to get him busted for the drugs. Even under the circumstances that seemed like a crummy thing to do. So eventually they learned to live with annoyance, grievance, and the sense that an unfairness had been done to them. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/books/chapters/city-boy.html

Still guilt-ridden (but happily about to leave New York for an extended stay in New Orleans), I thought I should create a celebration, one in which we'd emphasize his birthday rather than my departure and finally close the door on what was left of our relationship. So I assembled my own version of Capote's swans, those chic society ladies like Babe Paley and Gloria Guinness; mine were Joan Buck, Kathleen Tynan and my childhood friend M.T. -- and they did not let me down. We hauled out all our jewels and finery (I wore a black Chanel suit, my first), picked up the birthday boy in a Town Car and spent the rest of the night lavishly fussing over him -- and drinking, a lot. We started with Champagne and caviar and the excellent foie gras terrine and progressed through many bottles of Puligny-Montrachet to those chocolate and Grand Marnier soufflés you had to order ahead of time.

2004-03-29,A Bitter Pill,"Under mounting pressure, the Food and Drug Administration last week announced changes in the labeling of 10 antidepressants to reflect apprehension that they may increase suicidal feelings, especially among children and adolescents, especially in the first weeks of treatment. The issue surfaced in the early 1990's, when the drugs -- Prozac and Zoloft the most common among them -- first hit the market, and was soon dismissed. But recent studies have reignited concern. The labeling change is intended to make doctors more cautious about prescribing the drugs and patients more cautious about taking them. Such vigilance is crucial.

Created in 1824-25, the painting, an oil on canvas depicting the Watzmann mountain in the Alps, is a key work of German romanticism and, at more than 4 feet 5 inches by 5 feet 7 inches one of the few large Friedrich paintings. In 1937 the museum bought ''Der Watzmann'' from a Berliner, Martin Brunn, a Jew who was forced to sell it to finance his escape from the Nazi terror. The painting remained the property of the Nationalgalerie until 1999, when the heirs of Mr. Brunn reclaimed and then resold it to the Deka-Bank of Germany, which lent it to the museum on a permanent basis last week. Chancellor Schröder called the return of the painting to its Jewish owners the historical and ethical obligation of Germany. Nonetheless, he said, ''we will not be able to undo the injustice.''

His first known television appearance was as a backup musician on the locally produced ''Night Train.''

2004-03-29,Metro Briefing | New York: Hawthorne: Captain Cleared In D.U.I. Case Sues,"A New York City police captain has been cleared of a drunken driving charge, five months after he was arrested by the police in Westchester County, and has filed suit against the Westchester Police Department and its commissioner, according to court papers. The captain, Robert A. Iovino, 45, was suspended from duty after his arrest in October, when the car he was driving while off duty skidded on the Bronx River Parkway in Westchester and sideswiped a police car. On Thursday, Captain Iovino was acquitted. After the verdict, he filed a $10 million lawsuit against the Westchester County police commissioner, Thomas Belfiore, and against that county's police department, claiming that the Westchester police had violated his civil rights, among other claims. Calls to Westchester police officials were not immediately returned yesterday.

Shareholders of Metrocall, which is based in Alexandria, Va., will receive $150 million in cash and a 28 percent stake in the combined business, the companies said.

2004-03-31,A Buddhist Observes Humanity With Sharp and Stern Eyes,"''Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter . . . and Spring'' is an exquisitely simple movie. Written and directed by Kim Ki Duk, it was filmed at a single location -- a remote and picturesque mountain lake in a South Korean wilderness preserve -- and it concentrates on the relationship between a Buddhist monk and his young protégé, characters whose names are never spoken. But like Blake's ''Songs of Innocence and Experience,'' the film's lyrical plainness is the sign of a profound and sophisticated artistic sensibility. In five sharp, concise vignettes that correspond to the seasons of the title, Mr. Kim manages to isolate something essential about human nature and at the same time, even more astonishingly, to comprehend the scope of human experience.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/movies/film-festival-review-a-buddhist-observes-humanity-with-sharp-and-stern-eyes.html

2004-03-31,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: City Lifts Disputed Co-Op Fee,"A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the city in an effort to overturn a $50 fee on co-op sales and transfers. But the city said yesterday that it would stop collecting the fees. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court last week, claims that the city's Department of Finance illegally charges a $50 fee every time a co-op is sold or transferred. The fee should not apply to co-ops, the suit contends, because co-op sales or transfers involve the exchange of shares in a corporation rather than real estate. Aaron Shmulewitz, a lawyer who is representing the plaintiffs, estimated that the city had collected more than $1 million in such fees. Martha E. Stark, commissioner of the Finance Department, said in a statement that the department had reviewed the fee. ''Accordingly,'' she said, ''Finance will identify those who paid a fee for nondeed transactions after Jan. 1, 2003, and provide refunds where appropriate and will stop collecting fees on these transactions.'' Mr. Shmulewitz said his clients would continue to pursue the suit.
