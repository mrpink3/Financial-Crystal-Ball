The art world was still fairly small then, concentrated in just a few cities (London, Zurich and Paris among them), but its philosophical and commercial center was a cluster of storefronts in downtown Manhattan. In the years since, and especially in the last decade, the art world has transformed into a global monolith: there are now galleries with hundreds of employees and branches across several continents, businesses that have grown into international corporations overseeing the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year (and in some cases more). The industry is now an interconnected network of money and power that includes auction houses, where sales records are broken in a practiced routine that it is both mundane and exhausting, and art fairs, a pure distillation of capitalism in which galleries of all sizes pay large sums of money — thousands for a smaller gallery, usually tens of thousands for a larger one — to operate booths and peddle their wares to collectors (there are now more than 100 big ones all over the world). Art dealers are the entryway into this system, and many of those who began with mere ambitions to discover and financially support artists now must contend with the omnipresent threat of larger galleries, which scoop up those artists once they’ve become commercially successful.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/t-magazine/gallery-owners-paula-cooper-sean-kelly.html

Though her background is Iranian, Israeli and Yemeni, she has a deep love for the Moroccan table, where couscous is the star. “There’s so little real Moroccan food in New York,” she said. Kish-Kash, her vibrantly tiled new couscous parlor on Hudson Street in the West Village, takes its name from the broad, wood-rimmed sieve used to sift a mixture of semolina, water, oil and salt into ever finer-textured couscous. She’ll be tackling 10 pounds at a time, several days a week. The couscous will accompany a chicken tagine or stews of short ribs, lamb, fish or vegetables, all kosher. By day, orders will be placed and retrieved at the open kitchen counter; by night, there will be waiter service. The dinner menu will also feature mafrum, a dish built around stuffed, flattened potatoes. The restaurant will seat about 30, with some outdoor tables as well. Though Ms. Admony closed Balaboosta last month and now has Kish-Kash to keep her busy, she still runs Bar Bolonat, also on Hudson Street, and is adding to Taim, her group of falafel spots.

2018-06-13,The Obama-Trump Grand Strategy,"One of the paradoxes of Donald Trump’s election was that it seemed like a dramatic repudiation of Barack Obama — after the first black president, a birther; after a cool liberal academic, a roaring populist; after a multicultural “world man,” an American nationalist — and yet it happened at a time when Obama was quite popular. Ben Rhodes, the bright young salesman for Obama’s foreign policy, offered this explanation for the paradox in his recent book: “When you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/obama-trump-north-korea-summit.html

In my arms?!” she remembers thinking. James, 33, who used to make rent in Los Angeles hunting down and reselling vintage clothing, sourced a large, multi-compartmental columnar basket. Never mind that it was a vintage rice steamer — it was a perfect fit.

She suggests the very front and center, but if you’ve been trained to look at the back of the hoop, continue to do so. You need to look at this spot for at least one full second before beginning your shot. Try not to shift your eyes for even a millisecond. As you bring the ball up past your heart, it should pass, eclipse-like, between your eyes and the basket. “Shoot in a quick, fluid motion,” Vickers says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/magazine/how-to-make-more-free-throws.html

Other times, what unspooled before Aaron’s eyes was jarringly intimate: coffins being carried through the streets after drone strikes; a man squatting in a field to defecate after a meal (the excrement generated a heat signature that glowed on infrared); an imam speaking to a group of 15 young boys in the courtyard of his madrasa.

2018-06-14,What Does Italy Have to Be Proud of Now?,"MILAN — Things can change. In the 37 years that I have been living in Italy, I have watched nine World Cup tournaments. The Italian team was always there. In 1982 and 2006 it won. In 1994, in the United States, it lost the final on penalties to Brazil. In 1990, as host, it crashed out in the semifinals to Argentina. True, on other occasions it failed abjectly in the group stages. True, some years it left qualification for the competition to the very last game. But no one doubted it would win that game. No one doubted that a country that invests so much money and emotional energy in soccer, a country with so much flair, talent and sheer devilish cunning, would come good when it counts. But we were wrong. Italy’s national soccer team is not in Russia for this year’s World Cup. “The worst summer ever for Italian men,” a recent headline in Corriere della Sera declared: no World Cup and nothing to do on the beach but talk politics.

2018-06-14,Funky Ceramics Are Everywhere. Including in Galleries.,"More than sewing, flower-arranging or zine-making, clay might offer the perfect antidote to modern times. Hyper-tactile, it taps into a primal desire to shape earth — what the potter and writer Edmund de Waal has described as thinking through the hands — and is beloved for its immediacy. “You move and the clay moves with you,” says Aneta Regel, who was a finalist for this year’s Loewe Craft Prize and who, 12 years after graduating from London’s Royal College of Arts, now finds her works — lumpy, funky, cooked until cracked — aligned with a prevailing taste for artfully imperfect handwork, more generally, and for all things ceramic, in particular. If it is unsurprising to find mounting evidence of the trend on Instagram and at lifestyle-leaning boutiques like Samuji in New York and CristaSeya in Paris, it is notable that clay’s proliferation has, over the past decade, extended to the fine art world, which has long been wary of the material, widely considered to be lowly, functional and inexpensive. One of de Waal’s early teachers liked to say that his pots “had to be cheap enough to drop,” a condition that recalls the train tracks around Kolkata, India, strewn with shards of terracotta as a result of riders’ tossing their empty cups of chai out the window.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/t-magazine/ceramics-art-gallery-ruby-neri.html

While it might be foolish to bet against the Rolling Stones touring in, say, 2025, there’s little doubt that the genre of classic rock — its practitioners, its fans, its clout — is in steep decline. To write “Twilight of the Gods,” Steven Hyden, who was born in the 1970s, spent time immersing himself in the music he loves. He listened to albums, attended concerts, read canonical books on the subject and generally mused on questions like: “Why is classic rock a lifestyle as much as a form of music? Where did these traditions come from, and how did they become so ingrained? And when did all that mythology come undone, sending classic rock from the cultural penthouse to the funeral parlor?” Below, Mr. Hyden talks about how the Who helped to inspire the book, the connection between music and mortality, and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/books/twilight-of-gods-classic-rock-steven-hyden-interview.html

In 2015, U.S. Youth Soccer, the organization that oversees most of the country’s leagues for children and teenagers, announced a ban on heading in games and practices by participants younger than 11, citing concerns that the play might contribute to concussions. In response, some soccer authorities pointed out that young players would be late to learn an essential soccer skill and that concussions from heading are rare in that age group regardless. Now a study presented last month at the annual convention of the American College of Sports Medicine may help quell doubts about the current regulations, which went into effect in 2016.",Well,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/well/heading-soccer-ball-children-kids-concussion-brain.html

I resigned myself to a dozen mornings of waking up before dawn and just as many afternoons of finding myself fuzzy-headed at 4 and ready for bed soon after. What I didn’t anticipate were the fierce cravings that struck at all hours. Throughout the days and into some nights, I wanted both what I loved in China and what I missed while I was there. I dreamed of congee drizzled with vinegar, soup dumplings, slurpable noodles, tofu so fragile it wriggled off a spoon.

2018-06-21,"Review: In ‘Araby,’ the Story of a Wandering Laborer","“Araby” is set in southeast Brazil, and its dialogue is in Portuguese. But the first words heard in it are in English. As a handsome teen, the movie’s presumed protagonist, bicycles down a stretch of thruway untroubled by auto traffic, the beautiful, moving 1965 folk ballad “Blues Run the Game,” by Jackson C. Frank, plays on the soundtrack. “Wherever I have gone,” Frank sings, “the blues are all the same.” And this movie, written and directed by João Dumans and Affonso Uchôa, sees “the blues” as a universal language and condition.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/araby-review.html

As the camera crawls backward, we see a miniature horse standing calmly between his legs. The image — bizarrely comic and mildly menacing — occurs during the later stages of “Damsel,” but it handily encapsulates the tone of a movie that turns the classic western into something wackily eccentric and entertainingly original.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/damsel-review-robert-pattinson-mia-wasikowska.html

A Spy, a Big-League Catcher and an Enigma","Moe Berg played 15 mostly unremarkable seasons as a catcher in the majors for various teams, retiring in 1939 with a mediocre career batting average of .243 and a paltry six home runs. About his only notable accomplishment was an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games in the 1930s. This is hardly the stuff of big-screen biopics. But factor in his exploits in intelligence during World War II, and the draw becomes much clearer. Still, Paul Rudd’s biggest challenge in playing him wasn’t mastering skills behind the plate or in hand-to-hand combat.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/paul-rudd-the-catcher-was-a-spy.html

Marlina, a young widow living in remote Indonesia, spills blood in a story that plays out in four discrete acts. Each of the titled acts telegraphs some impending event (“The Robbery,” “The Birth”) and is clearly meant to create a mild sense of anticipation, much like the movie’s own explanatory title. Mostly, these are self-aware art-film touches ornamenting a blunt rape-revenge story that leans heavily and sometimes effectively on its sweeping landscapes, aesthetic violence, nods to Sergio Leone and what comes across as an overt debt to Jia Zhang-ke’s “Touch of Sin.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/review-marlina-the-murderer-in-four-acts.html

As a child, he’d staged plays at home with siblings, cousins and the help. By 14, at his rural boarding school in England, he was assistant directing Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt.” In Los Angeles, he finds unusual homes for his theatrical productions, often extravagant multi-hour riffs on classics such as “Medea’’ or “King Lear,” in makeshift theaters, including an indoor basketball court.

That her oldest daughter began to worry that she was getting a contact high while she was doing her homework made me despair for a generation and suggested that perhaps a certain unwarranted hysteria had taken hold.

McLaughlin, the author of BEARSKIN (Ecco/HarperCollins, $26.99). Terrible things are done to bears in this gruesomely gorgeous debut novel about an imperfect hero who redeems himself by taking up the cause of these noble, if terrifying, beasts. Rice Moore is a man with a criminal past that he hopes won’t follow him into the 7,000-acre Turk Mountain Preserve in rural Virginia, where he has recently been hired as caretaker. But poachers are killing black bears so they can sell the paws and gallbladders (delicacies in certain cuisines), forcing Rice to interact with rough mountain men who hunt whatever looks edible and field-dress their kills when the meat has stopped moving but is still warm. Given a choice, he’d rather be in the company of bears, whose “complex social network” interests him more than the dynamics in the local bar.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/books/review/james-mclaughlin-bearskin.html

In 2017, after years of running his West Coast microchain, Eggslut, Mr. Cailan went bicoastal, dividing his time between various restaurant projects and serving as the host of “The Burger Show,” a web series. This past April, he and his girlfriend, Angela Gomez, 27, moved to Manhattan permanently with Dashi, their American Bully. They are now living together in an apartment in NoLIta, with Mr. Cailan’s general manager, Kim Trac, 31, a block away.

For several years before he attempted to change the course of the American Revolution in 1780 by planning to help the British overtake West Point and capture George Washington, he had exhibited great courage and suffered serious injury for the colonies’ cause. “Within months of accepting command of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington had realized that Arnold was that prized rarity in an army of amateurs: a born soldier and charismatic leader of men,” Stephen Brumwell writes in his new book, “Turncoat: Benedict Arnold and the Crisis of American Liberty.” Arnold was a soldier after Washington’s “own heart, a tenacious fighter who refused to be discouraged by even the most unfavorable circumstances.” That Arnold betrayed his side is undoubted. But did he think of it that way?

The author, Eugène Briffault, was a journalist, gastronome, editor and critic who frequented the upper echelons of French society in the mid-19th century, a time of prosperity, indulgence and refinement. His book starts with dining habits in earlier eras and goes on to provide often acerbic commentary on the scene of his time, when Paris was considered to be the center of the culinary world. The book is filled with observations that still apply, like how the newly affluent display money but no taste, how female cooks are undervalued, how off-season vegetables please the eye but not the palate, and how tourism can be credited for the city’s cosmopolitan outlook. He suggests that “to be happy with the waiter, make sure the waiter is happy with you,” and notes that Parisians tossed their salads with about 500,000 gallons of vinegar a year. He covers the rich, the poor and even hospital food.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/dining/paris-a-table-1846-book.html

In Manhattan, he’s offering crisp whole mandarin fish with either Sichuan or sweet and pungent sauces, and salt-and-pepper veal ribs, in addition to favorites like wok-seared long dumplings, Sichuan cucumbers and kung pao chicken. “We’re also reviving the pupu platter, assuming the younger generation knows what it is,” said Tracy Young, Mr. Grinker’s business partner, referring to an assortment of small bites clustered around a tiny hibachi, the perfect sidekick to tiki-style drinks. The 56-seat room, dominated by a length of bar and red leather banquettes toward the rear, has a “been there forever” look. George Wong, the manager and another partner, said that there was once a Chinese restaurant in the space and that he was pleased to have another one.

On a lecture tour in the United States the next year, she discovered a mark on her plane ticket that suggested, to her, that she’d been placed on a watch list; she has not set foot in America since. Then, in 2012, on her 64th birthday, she “retired from being black.” She did this by uploading a digitally altered self-portrait to her website, in which she had darkened her skin — normally café très-au-lait — to the color of elephant hide. It was accompanied by a news bulletin announcing her retirement. The pithy text superimposed at the bottom of the photo elaborated: “Henceforth, my new racial designation will be neither black nor white but rather 6.25% grey, honoring my 1/16th African heritage,” she wrote. “Please join me in celebrating this exciting new adventure in pointless administrative precision and futile institutional control!” (Through extensive genealogical work, she later determined that her African heritage is closer to one-eighth.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/magazine/adrian-pipers-self-imposed-exile-from-america-and-from-race-itself.html

The evening would be a respite from Brennan’s public feud with the president of the United States, whom Brennan unfailingly refers to as “Mr. Trump.” A few days before, Brennan wrote an op-ed calling Trump “a snake-oil salesman.” The paper’s editors tried to persuade Brennan to use the word “president,” but Brennan refused. “I said no, I’m not going to refer to him as ‘president,’ ” Brennan told me. “Because he doesn’t deserve that, in my mind. Yes, he won the most electoral votes. But I think he has demonstrated, over and over again, that he is unfit to carry out the responsibilities of that office.” Trump fired back at Brennan a few hours after the op-ed was published, tweeting out a quote from a former Secret Service agent who had appeared on “Fox & Friends.” Brennan was both a “liar” and “a liar about being a liar,” the guest said.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/magazine/john-brennan-president-trump-national-security-state.html

Truly, a tour de force! “The song must be cultural, confessional, clear” — a pithy ars poetica for our volatile age. Hayes’s word plays, from homonyms to the transmogrification of Sturm und Drang into “storm and drum,” are less linguistic jokes than wry descriptions of an Anglo-America that has taken the historical discourse of Western civilization to its own brash level. And in case you were hoping to be let off easy, beware: The last line may stick in your throat.

For summer, he has turned to a warmer material: sand. Haulenbeek sculpts from a solid block of the silica-based variety — a byproduct of the casting process at the bronze foundry adjacent to his studio — before immersing the shape in tinted resin. One day, in the heat of creation, he seized on the perfect form through which to express the arid beauty of the technique: lamps that resemble flowering desert cacti, radiating light. $8,500, stevenhaulenbeek.com — NANCY HASS",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/t-magazine/zwirner-podcast-mary-macgill-store-editors-picks.html
