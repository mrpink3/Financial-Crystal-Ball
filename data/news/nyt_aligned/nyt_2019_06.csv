Now, he has recreated one of his own restaurants, Pastis, moving it around the corner from the original and recycling tiles, mirrors and other vintage details that were kept in storage during its five-year hiatus. Even the phone number is the same. “In building Pastis, I’ve tried to capture the spirit of the original more than build a replica of it,” Mr. McNally wrote in an email. This time around, he has a partner, the restaurateur Stephen Starr, a good thing because as hands-on as Mr. McNally can be, he had a stroke two years ago. Mr. McNally said that, despite the “awful effects” of the stroke, he is very much involved. “He designed the restaurant and has been here constantly,” Mr. Starr said. The larger space, which cost $8 million to build, is configured differently from the original. The money is on the art, media and fashion world to return. “My ideal clientele would be layabouts, prostitutes and ex-cons, but we’ll probably attract models, writers and a few judges,” Mr. McNally said. The restaurant, which has already been besieged by reservation-seekers, will also attract people to the area, now home to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Line and top-shelf boutiques. About half of the menu is the same, serving escargots, onion soup gratinée, salade niçoise, steak-frites, mussels and, on Fridays, bouillabaisse. New dishes include herring with potatoes, duck with olives and boudin blanc sausages. This time, there is some seating at curved red leather banquettes á la Balthazar, another McNally hot spot.

That government-produced film made for a “thorough and vivid comprehension of what a daylight bombing is actually like for the young men who wing our heavy bombers from English bases into the heart of Germany,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that year. To shoot it, cinematographers (including Wyler) flew on bombing missions; one of them, a first lieutenant named Harold J. Tannenbaum, was killed in the process. Restored footage shot for “The Memphis Belle” has been arranged by the director Erik Nelson for “The Cold Blue,” a new documentary, which uses Wyler’s material to give an intimate sense of what life was like in a World War II bomber. “It was more or less like being in death row in a penitentiary waiting on your turn,” one veteran says in a voice-over. “And you knew it was coming.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-cold-blue-and-d-day-stories.html

2019-06-06,36 Hours in Majorca,"Northern Europeans love Majorca, the breezy Balearic island about 125 miles off the coast of mainland Spain. An easy weekend getaway for sun-seeking Brits, Germans and Scandinavians, the Mediterranean island and its capital, Palma, are sometimes derided as a cheap package-tour destination for hard-partying holidaymakers. And in July and August — the height of the summer season — this is certainly true. But the rest of the year, you’re as likely to hear accented English as Mallorquí, the local dialect of Catalan. So wander the warren of narrow stone alleyways in Palma’s medieval center, drive inland to explore ancient olive groves and rural mountain villages, and along the way, discover another side of this surprising, sun-baked island.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/travel/what-to-do-in-majorca.html

2019-06-10,"T Suggests: English Roses, a Lost Film by Claire Denis and More","The photographer Luke Stephenson is a self-proclaimed nosy person. His curiosity has led him to capture some fairly esoteric subjects, like the parakeets (“budgies”) raised competitively among a subset of mostly older male Britons, and something called the “Clown Egg Register,” a collection of over 250 eggs painted to look like clowns and owned by Clowns International, a society established in London over half a century ago. Of his anthropological approach, Stephenson explains, “I really enjoy the challenge of discovering the best people to speak to who can open the right doors.” Recently, he trained his lens on the English rose, a flower bred by the renowned British horticulturist David Austin in the 1960s. Austin died earlier this year, but today, more than 150 strains of his English rose are commercially available, each with a name selected by Austin himself. “David was always very fussy about the names he chose for his roses,” explains Michael Marriott, the senior rosarian at David Austin Roses. “He used to say that giving a rose a bad name was the easiest way to kill it. He liked to choose names that were very English, names that immediately evoked Britishness.” The Anne Boleyn, the Dame Judi Dench and the Maid Marion are just a few of the varieties that appear in Stephenson’s new book, “The English Rose.” Each flower is documented in Stephenson’s signature style — a single specimen against a brightly colored backdrop — creating a pop version of an 18th-century nature Wunderkammer. Stephenson continues to focus on singularities of British culture because, he says, “I have lived on this little island all my life, and I like to think I understand it, so I seek out these little oddities. I want to discover more.” “The English Rose” is available to purchase at lukestephenson.com, with prints from the series available at the Photographers’ Gallery, 16-18 Ramillies Street, London, thephotographersgallery.org. — JAMIE SIMS",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/t-magazine/kohei-yoshiyuki-jake-xerxes-fussell-editors-picks.html

2019-06-10,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘A Star Is Born’ and ‘The Black Godfather’,"A STAR IS BORN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. In the latest and fourth remake of this film, Bradley Cooper plays Jackson Maine, an alcoholic country-rock star, who meets Ally Campana (Lady Gaga), a waitress with a powerful voice and a gift for songwriting. Throughout the film, co-written and directed by Cooper, we watch the two collaborate and fall in love. But as Ally’s music career soars, Jackson’s falters. The film was chosen as a New York Times Critic’s Pick by Manohla Dargis, who wrote in her review: “Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-a-star-is-born-and-the-black-godfather.html

2019-06-12,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Rolling Thunder Revue’ and ‘Krypton’,"ROLLING THUNDER REVUE: A BOB DYLAN STORY BY MARTIN SCORSESE Stream on Netflix. As far as adherence to reality goes, Martin Scorsese’s new “Bob Dylan story” sits somewhere between Scorsese’s 2005 Dylan documentary, “No Direction Home,” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” In other words: It’s loose with the facts. There’s tour footage shot in 1975 and more recent on-camera interviews with Dylan, Joan Baez, Sam Shepard and other real figures — the kind of things you’d expect. But there are also some fictional characters mixed in, like a fake filmmaker (played by Martin von Haselberg) who we are told shot the tour footage. (In reality, the footage was shot for Dylan’s much-maligned 1978 film, “Renaldo and Clara.”) This coloring outside the lines of traditional documentary is fitting for a movie about Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue, a hectic parade through the northeastern United States and Canada that saw Dylan performing in offbeat venues like a mah-jongg parlor in Falmouth, Mass., with a band that included Baez, T Bone Burnett and, eventually, Joni Mitchell.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-rolling-thunder-revue-and-krypton.html

The wigs and makeup reference the progressive gender politics of iconic London club nights from the ’80s and ’90s, such as Kinky Gerlinky, a theme that Rose explores in her collection. “Is it too much?” Rose asks Rothstein, and they pause to consider the model, who is wearing a denim jacket with oversize shoulders over a red satin dragon-print shirt, paired with flared fitted trousers. “The boys look slightly sinister,” Rose explains. “I wanted an unsettling feeling, because that’s the undertone in everything happening globally.

But there’s much more to Oxford than cloistered academia.

These brave souls would regularly leave their families for years on end, to slaughter sperm whales in distant oceans thousands of miles from home. “That’s just how it was back then,” my father often told me, in a whimsical tone laced with longing and nostalgia. “The men in our family, they just went out to sea.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/opinion/my-absent-father.html

2019-06-14,A Glimpse of Virginia Woolf’s Original Manuscript for ‘Mrs. Dalloway’,"“I am the only woman in England free to write what I like,” Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary in 1925, the year she published her fourth novel. Thanks to a new reproduction of the only full draft of MRS. DALLOWAY (SP Books, $220), handwritten in three notebooks and initially titled “The Hours,” we now know that the story she completed — about a day in the life of a London housewife planning a dinner party — was a far cry from the one she’d set out to write. The novel we know today begins with the iconic sentence “Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.” But a manuscript page dated June 1923 bears a different opening: “In Westminster, where temples, meeting houses, conventicles, & steeples of all kinds are congregated together, there is at all hours & halfhours, a round of bells, correcting each other, asseverating that time has come a little earlier, or stayed a little later, here or here.” Woolf began writing a “big book about London after World War I,” said Michael Cunningham, whose Pulitzer-winning novel “The Hours” was based on Woolf’s. But “she didn’t go very far with that before she appears to have realized that the ‘big’ book she thought she should write was not really the book she wanted to write. The transition for her was understanding that a book about an outwardly ordinary woman on an ordinary day in London could be every bit as ‘big’ as the books about wars and revolutions.” Rather than one of many minor threads, as Woolf initially planned, Mrs. Dalloway’s became the entire story.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/books/review/virginia-woolf-mrs-dalloway.html

The literary side is reflected in his title, which is taken from Humbert Humbert’s terse description of the cause of his mother’s death in “Lolita”: “(picnic, lightning).” The personal involves the deaths of Scott’s own parents: his mother in 2010, when he was 30, and his father in 2012. Scott is interested in the ways social media and other technologies change our understanding of what is public and private. It’s a capacious book, moving freely from Walter Benjamin to the TV soap “Dynasty”; from the “metaphysics” of Marie Kondo to Heidegger’s consideration of the question “What is a thing?” Below, Scott talks about Brexit, influencers, how our feelings have become big business and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/books/picnic-comma-lightning-laurence-scott-interview.html

If you harm them, they’ll remember. They’ll scold you, follow you, caw, swoop down and maybe even scratch you (Marzluff calls this behavior their “culture of hate”). Thirteen years ago, he wore a mask while trapping crows on campus for a study, and even now, if they see him in the mask, he says, “they go nuts.” If you need to scare a crow, do it surreptitiously.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/magazine/how-to-scare-a-crow-tip.html

2019-06-18,‘There’s Just No Doubt That It Will Change the World’: David Chalmers on V.R. and A.I.,"Over the past two decades, the philosopher David Chalmers has established himself as a leading thinker on consciousness. He began his academic career in mathematics but slowly migrated toward cognitive science and philosophy of mind. He eventually landed at Indiana University working under the guidance of Douglas Hofstadter, whose influential book “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” had earned him a Pulitzer Prize. Chalmers’s dissertation, “Toward a Theory of Consciousness,” grew into his first book, “The Conscious Mind” (1996), which helped revive the philosophical conversation on consciousness. Perhaps his best-known contribution to philosophy is “the hard problem of consciousness” — the problem of explaining subjective experience, the inner movie playing in every human mind, which in Chalmers’s words will “persist even when the performance of all the relevant functions is explained.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/opinion/david-chalmers-virtual-reality.html

Kevin Costner plays the patriarch of a wealthy family that lives on a chunk of sought-after land in this series, a modern-day western from the writer-director Taylor Sheridan. The first season was marked by great, sweeping shots of Montana and Utah, where the show is filmed — not that there was much time to admire the scenery. The series is full of backstabbing and conflict, as competing interests vie for the land, and disputes erupt in the family itself. In his review of Season 1 in The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the show “has a few interesting things buried within.” “But,” he continued, “you need to dig through a lot of drab, hard-packed filler to get to them.” Perhaps the second season  will shift that balance.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-yellowstone-and-an-obscure-claire-denis-film.html

Someone asked me what I thought, and I turned into a wine writer: It was vinegary on the nose; there were afternotes of pond water, acid, fire. I took another taste. That one was better — tart and refreshing. I put the bottle in the refrigerator and took sips from it over the course of a few days, particularly in the morning, when it delivered a jolt that I thought was superior to coffee. It gave me a feeling akin to taking a shower outside, or drinking a Coke poured over pebble ice.

Unfamiliar with business of any kind, he concocts a promotion in which four contestants will camp out on a platform in front of a billboard the station owns while the station broadcasts their squabbles. One could conceivably craft a Capra-esque, scrappy-underdog crowd-pleaser here, or a parable on the excesses of capitalism. But the movie misses both marks, widely.

Her eyes, dark brown and wildly expressive, seem to grow three times their size when confronted with, say, the lies of an untrustworthy landlord or an unrepentant teenage troublemaker. Her eyebrows do a cartoonish slant from left to right, like an emoji meant to signal anger; her cheekbones, ordinarily sharp, soften whenever she purses her lips in disapproval, which is often. She wears a plain black robe with an ornate lace collar and occasionally slides on a pair of unrimmed glasses to look over legal documents. But all of it — the eyes, the brows, the lips, the face — has always been framed by a round pixie bob, virtually unchanged since the Clinton administration. So imagine my surprise when I walked into a ritzy hotel restaurant in Beverly Hills for my second meeting with Sheindlin — better known as Judge Judy — and found her wearing, for the first time, a clip-on ponytail.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/magazine/judge-judy-tv.html

Perhaps it was because she shifted her practice slightly later in life that she was able to make inventive work up until the end of it (the artist died last year). “Shadows and Silhouettes,” opening next week at David Kordansky Gallery, in Los Angeles, picks up about where the Met show left off, with 12 Woodman works that date from 2008 to 2016. Most compelling are those that combine painted canvas and glazed earthenware — it’s as though the clay elements of Woodman’s imagined interiors refused to be merely depicted and decided to burst through the works’ surfaces. In “Tuesday Afternoon” (2016), a three-dimensional vase sits just in front of a canvas, its form echoed in the painting by a blank space like a cutout, or a phantom of what once was. “It’s a kind of mysterious move that started to crop up in some of the late paintings,” says Stuart Krimko, the gallery’s research and editorial director. “The vessels become like characters, and the relationship between the vessel and the figure becomes more psychologically charged.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/t-magazine/betty-woodman-grateful-dead-body-oil-editors-picks.html

I used to think it was self-indulgent or shameful to write about my private passions, but then I realized that as a reader I loved learning about other writers’ obsessions.

H. Lawrence” — or maybe he wanted to write a novel about this writer who made him want to become a writer. He travels to Taormina (where Lawrence lived briefly); to Eastwood, in England (to visit the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum and Gift Shop, an episode that unravels into a description of his mother’s jigsaw-puzzle technique); to Oxford (“or Dullford”); and to Oaxaca, where, he writes, “I sniffed around the city a little but my heart wasn’t in it. … Maybe those are the words that should be on my grave: ‘His heart wasn’t in it.’” He ends up writing the best book ever written about not writing a book about D.

Jasper and Camilla Guinness, a landscape architect and an interior designer, respectively, both originally from London, purchased the property in 1989, when it was a long-neglected, tumbledown relic, and, over the following years, industriously transformed it into a functional and lively family home where they raised their two daughters — and received a seemingly endless stream of visitors. The couple replanted the long barren scrubland that surrounded the property with olive groves, cypress, fruit trees and lavender; they installed running water and electricity; and they decorated the interiors in a freewheeling mix of British and Tuscan styles, sourcing rustic Italian furniture from nearby junkyards and enlisting local artisans to fabricate antique-style iron bed frames for the five bedrooms. The Guinnesses’ aim was to create a sense of “real comfort, not in the luxury way but in the convivial sense,” Camilla explained on a recent rainy afternoon, seated by the living room fireplace before a Sunday lunch hosted by her daughter Amber.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/t-magazine/amber-camilla-guinness-arniano-painting-school.html

People hurled insults, then coins, beer cans and bricks. Reinforcements rushed to the scene as Stonewall supporters poured out of neighboring dives to join the melee.

(In a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, Youssef said he created “Ramy” to humanize a Muslim family, “which turned out to be a lot easier than humanizing New Jersey.”) On the heels of the show’s success — it has a 97 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has been picked up for a second season — Youssef is starring in his first HBO special, “Feelings.” In his signature mellow delivery, he shares his father’s immigration story, questions his love of LeBron James and contemplates the baggage that comes with having sex.
