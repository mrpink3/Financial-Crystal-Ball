The spectators wore “derbies, boaters, checkered caps and porkpie hats,” wrote Beverly Chico in her book, “Hats and Headwear Around the World.” Each style signaled a distinct social identity. All are now regarded largely as museum pieces, having fallen away in favor of a hat that offers casual comfort and a comforting image of classlessness.

Daoud had an original, epigrammatic style: playful, lyrical, brash. I could also see why he’d been accused of racism, even “self-hatred.” After Sept. 11, for example, he wrote that the Arabs had been “crashing” for centuries and that they would continue crashing so long as they were better known for hijacking planes than for making them.

And so they do in Dolce & Gabbana’s one-of-a-kind sculptural earrings that evoke summer in Sicily, Domenico Dolce’s birthplace. Each handcrafted pendant, part of the Italian house’s rarefied Alta Gioielleria, or high jewelry, collection, begins with a daisy of faceted aquamarine petals, its center cut from golden beryl — a pure yellow gem known for its brilliant hue. A two-inch gold drone, a symbol of royalty and nature’s industriousness, dangles from the edge, seemingly sipping nectar. The bee’s head, legs and thorax are diamond-encrusted; its eyes are emeralds and its wings are fashioned of painstakingly formed filigree. Alternating bands of curved black jade and citrine create the stripes on the insect’s abdomen and a large, baroque South Sea pearl hangs from the bottom. They may not make honey, but they will turn heads. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/dolce-gabbana-bee-earrings/

The Chicago Defender, unofficial organ of the migration, had a national circulation of 130,000. Everything that was fit to print, from the latest racial pogroms to Negro League baseball box scores, filled its ­pages, giving voice to the voiceless along the color line of American political and social life. In 2000, Vernon Jarrett, a longtime Chicago Defender reporter and a syndicated columnist at The Chicago Tribune, described black newspapers as “the most predominant media influence on black people. . . .

2015-04-03,An Easygoing Trip of a Track From the Stylish Musical Project Tennis,"To hear her tell it, performing at a runway show was one of the hardest things Alaina Moore, the frontwoman of the duo Tennis, has ever done. “I had never been to one before, but I think it went super well,” she says of hitting the stage at Rebecca Minkoff’s spring/summer 2013 show with her Tennis bandmate and husband, Patrick Riley. “Rebecca wanted us to play live, but she also wanted a D.J. to spin a playlist of all of the songs that were important to her. So we did this mashup where the D.J. would play 30 seconds of a track and then we’d drop in on the same beat. It was such a crazy experience. I’m glad Rebecca didn’t doubt us, because the whole time I was very nervous.” She had no reason to be, as the band’s fashion and culture bona fides are well established: Their music has also been picked as a soundtrack for ads for Marc Jacobs and Tory Burch and, last month, a scene on “Girls.” Moore has also recently begun contributing to the British style magazine Port — a welcome extracurricular break from her daily routine. “Since I’m constantly on the road which a bunch of guys, I usually have such an unglamorous lifestyle,” she says.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/tennis-band-easter-island-song/

They had an arresting presence, a combination of graphic refinement, aural strangeness and compressed meaning that made you stop and ponder.

Others remember Ruskin as the Victorian who, on his wedding night, was so appalled by the sight of his wife’s pubic hair that he refused to sleep with her (ever). What really turned Ruskin off?

(13) BILLY PORTER: BROADWAY AND SOUL Mr. Porter — who won several awards as the drag queen Lola, above, in the Broadway musical “Kinky Boots” — performs jazz-inflected standards from the American Songbook in this “Live From Lincoln Center” presentation. As he transformed “Take the Moment,” an obscure song from the Richard Rodgers-Stephen Sondheim musical “Do I Hear a Waltz?,” into a pop-gospel plea, “his performance created the kind of epiphany that a great voice can conjure out of thin air,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The key lay not only in Mr. Porter’s innate vocal power but also in his commitment to shoot the moon, no matter the consequences.” But the evening’s coup was his reinvention of “Sunday,” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” as a church anthem, fusing Broadway and gospel traditions. “It was the kind of juxtaposition that probably only Mr. Porter could have pulled off,” Mr. Holden added, “and it struck deep.” In “Annie Lennox: Nostalgia Live in Concert,” at 10, Ms. Lennox puts her own spin on the genre with “Summertime,” “Strange Fruit,” “God Bless the Child” and other works in a “Great Performances” presentation taped at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2015-04-03,Borecore,"The Vine videos that rise to the top of the heap typically feature dance routines, quick-cut pranks and the occasional clever stop-motion short. But if you tap into the video-sharing app’s raw “fire hose,” a different picture emerges. For example, VPeeker — a site that provides an unending stream of recent Vine uploads — reveals that buried beneath those popular Vines lies a less visible but more intriguing trend: six-second displays of normalcy. Rather than killing time at the mall, in a Spencer’s Gifts or the food court, young people are filming themselves doing the incredibly mundane: goofing around in a backyard pool, lounging on basement couches, whatever; in other words, recording the minutiae of their lives and uploading it for not very many to see. New services are stepping in too, offering the immediacy Vine cannot. There’s Meerkat, which lets people broadcast video feeds from their phones of what they’re doing at any particular moment. There’s YouNow, which is like Meerkat but primarily the domain of teenagers, who use it to stream video of themselves, bored, at home, in their bedrooms. (For now, it’s totally innocent.) A cynic might dismiss all this obsessive self-documentation as evidence of generational narcissism, but you could just as easily choose to view it as a developing global pastime. Call it borecore: the never-to-be-viral output that comes from mixing powerful devices and a lifetime of social-­media training with regular, old teenage boredom. Seen this way, its predecessors are more prosaic than pathological: doodling in a composition notebook, making scrapbooks, driving around aimlessly. But that simplicity, that sameness, can feel magical when you binge on it: a series of furtive glimpses into the lives of people across the country and around the world doing a whole lot of nothing. Though the technology available to us has far exceeded our wildest imaginations, it’s still perfectly suited to filling those moments when our imaginations just won’t do.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/magazine/borecore.html

Eddie has no hands. How exactly he came to have them severed, a final act of desperation in a novel singularly focused on desperate acts, isn’t revealed until the end.

When she is tempted in her stupor into a van and into a contract with a company called Delicious Foods, which also gives the novel its title, she is secreted away to a camp where she is forced to work, in order to pay off the debt of her room and food and the diet of crack cocaine overseers use to keep their slave laborers subdued.

At the age of 43, upon learning that her common law husband of 14 years had secretly married a 22-year-old actress, Eleanor took poison and died. Had her father, Karl Marx, been alive he would have been not only distressed by her death but, I think, dismayed that a daughter of his could not surmount this level of betrayal, for the sake of international socialism if nothing else.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/books/review/eleanor-marx-a-life-by-rachel-holmes.html
2015-04-03,Inside the List,"The Reformer: At least since the frenzied days after 9/11, some pundits have called on moderate Muslims to criticize the more extreme elements of their faith from within. Ayaan Hirsi Ali would seem to fit the bill: Born in Somalia to a Muslim family, she fled to the Netherlands rather than submit to a forced marriage, and has since been vocal in chastising radical Islam for its embrace of violence as well as its treatment of women, gay people and nonbelievers; in short, she’d like to see Islam evolve to become more secular and ecumenical. (She outlined much of this agenda, along with her life story, in the 2007 book “Infidel,” which spent seven months on the hardcover and paperback nonfiction lists.) So it’s been interesting to see just how polarizing Hirsi Ali — whose new book, “Heretic,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8 — has turned out to be. A professed liberal, she applied for work with left-leaning think tanks when she moved to America in 2007, but found no takers. “They didn’t say it to my face, but I got the feeling that they were uncomfortable with what I had been saying about Islam,” she told the author Sam Harris last year. Instead she found a home with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which seems at peace with her message that Islam is a religion of war. “Muslims regard any ‘insult’ to the Prophet or the Quran as deserving the ultimate penalty,” she writes in “Heretic” — which makes the case for an Islamic Reformation — “and this is not an extreme position.” To her critics, Hirsi Ali may lack nuance: In fighting fervor with fervor, she can seem less like a moderate Muslim than an immoderate anti-Muslim. (In fact, as she explained in “Infidel,” she is now an atheist.) Then again, lack of nuance has never hurt a book’s success. Isn’t that part of Hirsi Ali’s argument, after all?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/books/review/inside-the-list.html

They’re reading a variety of historical perspectives, such as Louise Erdrich’s “The Birchbark House” and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” books.

2015-04-06,Refreshening Postmodern Roots,"If dance seasons were like fashion weeks, then some trends from the Spring 2015 collections would be legacy projects and tributes to Merce Cunningham. Paul Taylor just ended the inaugural catwalk of his American Modern Dance initiative to preserve vintage dances and champion younger contemporary voices alongside his own. And last month brought nods to Cunningham, who died in 2009, by Compagnie CNDC-Angers from France and Juilliard Dances Repertory. This week, the Stephen Petronio Company wraps up its 30th anniversary by starting “Bloodlines,” a five-year project to restage important postmodern dances. First up: Cunningham’s “RainForest” from 1968, a work that feels both fanciful and menacing, with layers of drama, innocence and rebellion. Mr. Petronio also contributes a world premiere of his own, “Non Locomotor,” a companion to last year’s “Locomotor” (also part of this program), which confirms that three decades on, he’s still addicted to the art of speed.

The historical drama, presented here by “Masterpiece,” begins as Cardinal Thomas Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce, above right with Mr. Rylance), having failed to secure the annulment of the marriage of Henry (Damian Lewis) to Katherine of Aragon (Joanne Whalley), is stripped of his powers — placing his hope of returning to the king’s favor on Cromwell.

When he learned of a new recording of the complete Schoenberg string quartets played by the Juilliard String Quartet, he ordered four copies. Aghast, his father asked if he was trying to put him out of business. To teach his son a lesson, he told him to put the recordings of these atonal chamber works on the shelves with the more mainstream classical records and report back when the last copy had been sold. That took seven years. The lesson Mr. Glass learned? “I can sell anything if I have enough time.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/books/review-philip-glasss-words-without-music-tells-of-a-life-full-of-changes-in-rhythm.html

That won’t come out easily.” Nearly 20 years later, in the wake of a draft deal between the Obama administration and Iran, we have what may be the best chance to begin to pry that sign loose, to ease the U.S.-Iran cold/hot war that has roiled the region for 36 years.

(Starz Cinema) THE LUNCHBOX (2014) When a delivery service sends a lunch intended for her husband astray, a neglected Mumbai housewife (Nimrat Kaur, above left, with Yashvi Puneet Nagar) finds herself communicating through handwritten letters and home-cooked meals with a widowed office worker (Irrfan Khan) nearing retirement in this debut feature from Ritesh Batra. “This is not a new conceit,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, citing “You’ve Got Mail” and “The Shop Around the Corner.” But, he wrote, “the idea of two lonely souls connecting in a vast, modern metropolis, and remaining strangers even as their intimacy grows, has a durable charm. As do Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaur, islands of melancholy calm surrounded by silliness and noise. Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore. And Mr. Batra makes their story touching and credible, an urban fable of hope in the face of disappointment.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-04-07,Georgia: Judge Sets Hearing on Request by Transgender Inmate for Transfer,"A federal district judge on Monday set a hearing for Thursday on an emergency motion in the case of a transgender woman, Ashley Diamond, who is seeking an immediate transfer to a lower-security prison or “transitional center” so that she can be safer from sexual assault. Judge Marc T. Treadwell also asked Georgia corrections officials to produce all communications — “emails, correspondence, messages, etc.” — regarding Ms. Diamond’s transfer several weeks ago to Georgia State Prison. Ms. Diamond alleges that the transfer, to a prison with a relatively high prevalence of sexual violence, was “apparently retaliatory” for her lawsuit against corrections officials. Ms. Diamond, 36, is a nonviolent offender and first-time inmate who has lived as a transgender woman since adolescence, but has been held in prisons for men, most of them high-security, for the last three years. She claims in her lawsuit to have suffered at least seven sexual assaults as well as routine sexual coercion and harassment. In addition to safer housing, her lawsuit, filed in February, seeks access to the hormone therapy that is essential medical care for her gender dysphoria. She had been taking hormones for 17 years, she says, until the prison system denied her access. A Georgia corrections spokeswoman said on Monday that Ms. Diamond “has been receiving the appropriate treatment assessed by Georgia Correction Health medical staff” since March. This is apparently a reference to a hormone patch given to her in response to her lawsuit.

In separate extremist attacks, a former militant who was suspected of being a police informer was seriously injured and a police officer in another district was shot in the neck from close range. “If you see all the three incidents, they have resorted to attack on soft targets where people were unarmed,” S. J. M. Gillani, inspector general of police in Kashmir, told the NDTV news channel. Among other recent violence in the area, a police officer and a soldier were killed Thursday by militants who escaped and last month an attack on a police station and army camp left three police officers, four militants and a civilian dead.

Somerset Maugham novel. Liev Schreiber plays Charles Townsend, the married charmer who brings Kitty to life — and then close to death when Walter, a doctor, discovers their affair and hustles her into the countryside during a cholera epidemic. “As nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles.” Mr. Norton, she added, “is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Bush.” In other words, there were a whole bunch of people, presumably on the left, who not only didn’t like George W. Bush, but also disliked him to an irrational and perhaps unhinged degree. By coining a “syndrome” to describe the state, Krauthammer, a formerly practicing psychiatrist with an M.D. from Harvard, was injecting a clever bit of gas-lighting into the debate.

We spent hours walking through a mosaic of grassland and sedge, past wet fields cut with scrub-shadow and flashes of open water. Everywhere was bursting with life: singing nightingales, snipe winnowing through the upper air, cuckoos tilting from the tips of willows and rails squealing and grunting in reeds. As we walked on wet grass by one of the fen’s ancient waterways, a barn owl floated past us, its mothy wings shining through particulate mist; at our feet a drinker moth caterpillar inched furrily across the path like a cautiously mobile mustache. We knelt to watch its progress. Then my niece turned to me and asked: “When they made this place, where did they bring the animals from? Did they come from a zoo?”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/the-living-beauty-of-wicken-fen.html

It became the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads, according to Apple. Starting Monday a group of lawyers and advocates connected to Mr. Syed will debut another podcast, “Undisclosed: The State v. Adnan Syed,” which will “examine and explore the case in greater detail, from an investigatory perspective instead of a narrative one,” according to a statement. “Undisclosed” is being presented by Rabia Chaudry, a lawyer who has been a longtime advocate of Mr. Syed — as “Serial” fans know, she was the one who suggested that Sarah Koenig, the host of “Serial” and a longtime producer for “This American Life,” look into the case — along with two other lawyers, Susan Simpson and Colin Miller. None of them represent Mr. Syed but each has been investigating the case, Ms. Chaudry said in an interview Tuesday. New episodes of “Undisclosed” are to be released every two weeks. The podcast is sponsored by the Adnan Syed Legal Trust, which, according to a page on the crowdfunding site LaunchGood, is dedicated to Mr. Syed’s defense and has raised $93,000. In November the producers of “Serial” said that a second season was coming. In February a Maryland court agreed to hear an appeal from Mr. Syed, who has said that he is not guilty of Ms. Lee’s murder and that he received ineffective legal counsel at trial.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/business/media/another-serial-chapter-from-group-of-lawyers.html

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the use of such contraceptives at clinics that receive federal money under the Title X program, which focuses on low-income adults and teenagers. About eight million young women ages 15 to 19 sought birth control at the clinics from 2005 to 2013. At the beginning of the study period, just 0.4 percent, or about 4,000, were using long-term birth control. By 2013, the researchers reported, that had risen to 7 percent, or about 40,000 teenagers. Federal officials say that although long-acting birth control is by far the most effective method, its use among women over all still lags, and they are encouraging providers to take steps to increase the numbers.  ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/us/more-teens-using-long-term-contraception.html

2015-04-08,Visually Arresting Graphic Rugs That Value Asymmetry (So as Not to Compete With God),"The art director Alex Proba (of StudioProba, A Poster A Day and Kickstarter) and the rug and textile designer Aelfie Oudghiri (of Aelfie) are two of a kind — both create colorful, arrestingly graphic work; originally studied to be doctors in Europe; and are pillars of the collab-happy Brooklyn design community. And so one thing led to another, and a new series of limited-edition rugs and other decorative items, debuting Monday at Shop Cooper Hewitt, was born. The five rug styles ($1,675 each) and three pillow designs ($105 each), hand-dyed and -loomed in the Uttar Pradesh region of northern India, take cues from Kurdish weaving motifs and early Internet graphics, and feature hand-knotting techniques that make them look, Proba says, “more 3D than they actually are.” Many are asymmetrical, like the designs in Proba’s poster series: “That’s one of the reasons I was excited about her work, because you have to work at looking at it,” Oudghiri explains. “That’s a huge tenet of rug weaving; you keep things asymmetrical as a form of humility because you don’t want to compete with God.” And for those who might be, as Proba puts it, “afraid to commit” to the high-impact textiles, the shop will also be selling posters ($155) of the original flat designs.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/t-magazine/alex-proba-aelfie-oudghiri-graphic-rugs.html

If a parent’s emotions seem somehow too enormous and complex, a book about endless devotion can end up striking many as unsettling rather than reassuring. Take the latest round of debate over Shel Silverstein’s classic “The Giving Tree.” Is the book’s depiction of all-in maternal self-sacrifice beautiful, or disturbing and patriarchal? Impassioned arguments persist on both sides. That split recalls similar objections to Robert Munsch’s “Love You Forever,” first published in 1986, which features a new mother rocking her baby and singing a little song that ends, “As long as I’m living / my baby you’ll be.” She repeats the song as she snuggles up to her child through his childhood and teenage years, and even when he is a grown man. Some see in the tale a straightforward, reassuring depiction of the boundlessness of a parent’s love. Others think it’s just too smothering and creepy, especially the way the woman crawls into her adult son’s bed.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/books/review/should-you-be-a-river-and-wish.html

Once the capital of this Central American country (before a series of devastating earthquakes forced the colonial government to move to Guatemala City in the late 1700s), Antigua, population 41,000, is a Unesco World Heritage site. Yet in addition to the striking 17th- and 18th-century ruins right in the center of town, the city offers an array of restaurants, boutiques and bars with live music.

Indeed, the iconic filmmaker left an indelible mark. “He was an explorer, an inventor, a man in perpetual inquiétude regarding the cinematographic form,” remarks Serge Toubiana, the director of the Cinémathèque, which is also hosting a complete filmic retrospective running through May 31. Toubiana cites the sense of “narrative shock, aesthetic shock” Antonioni brought to cinema — whether featuring a fashion photographer modeled on David Bailey in the swinging London of “Blow Up” or casting the exquisite Monica Vitti in a trio of films (“L’Avventura,” “La Notte,” “L’Eclisse”) about indefinable human malaise. Although never quite celebrated or completely understood in his native Italy, he won accolades internationally, some of which are displayed in the exhibition, including a Palme d’Or from 1967, and an honorary Oscar from 1995 (represented by a mislabeled replica, as the original was stolen during a burglary).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/antonioni-show-cinematheque-francaise/

2015-04-09,What’s on TV Thursday,"10 P.M. (FX) THE COMEDIANS Billy Crystal is a comedy legend whose best work may be behind him and Josh Gad is a rising star in this new series, which ventures behind the scenes at “The Billy & Josh Show,” a semifictional late-night sketch series. Stephnie Weir plays the long-suffering producer caught between the men, who agree on almost nothing; Matt Oberg is the show’s head writer; and Megan Ferguson is the no-nonsense production assistant. “Semifake Billy and semifake Josh drop references to these real-life résumés constantly in ‘The Comedians’ as they try to one-up each other while battling over the show they’re supposed to be creating together,” Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times. How meta is it? In Episode 4, Mel Brooks “advises his friend Billy not to try to book a big-name guest on ‘The Billy & Josh Show’ because it would distract the audience from the title characters. Mr. Brooks, of course, steals the episode.” In the Season 5 opener of “Louie,” at 10:30, Louie (Louis C.K.) admits in therapy that he’s not sure “how to live a life anymore” and encounters an angry lesbian at a school potluck. “This time around, as Louis C.K. reinvents the classic sitcom in his own elliptical, cerebral style, he seems to be in his absurdist theater phase, or his surrealist short-story phase — Kafka on the Hudson,” Mike Hale wrote in The Times. “His moments of victory, and redemption, come when he’s alone, onstage, working a funny voice and a dumb joke.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

2015-04-09,Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tony Hale’s Demented Double Act on ‘Veep’,"The show begins — the very first scene of the very first episode — with a man helping a woman put on her coat. The man is tall. The woman is small. The man is balding. The woman has the shimmering hair of an extremely convincing shampoo ad. The man wears a nondescript dark suit, a striped tie and some kind of ID badge — the uniform of the bureaucratic functionary. He has a five o’clock shadow and the hint of a double chin. The woman wears a snug red dress with a deep neckline, an elegant gold necklace, understated makeup. She is the vice president of the United States. Getting her coat on is therefore an official matter of state, and the man is clearly treating it as such; he concentrates intently on maneuvering her right arm into the coat’s right sleeve. The woman, meanwhile, pays no attention to the man or to the coat, never even glances back; she stares forward, into the eyes of her chief of staff, with whom she is having a conversation.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/julia-louis-dreyfus-and-tony-hales-demented-double-act-on-veep.html

2015-04-09,Ana Khouri’s Newest Jewelry Forms — to Accentuate a Woman’s Own,"The Brazilian designer Ana Khouri’s fine jewelry isn’t defined by carats, cut or color, nor by its high-profile fans, like Madonna and Jennifer Lawrence. Instead, she aims to distinguish her work by highlighting its natural synergy with the human anatomy. In her latest designs (she doesn’t create collections), the former art scholar and sculptor is taking that notion, of connecting the accessory to its wearer, even further. Today at Dover Street Market New York, she debuts collar necklaces, earrings, rings and bracelets made from materials like yellow gold, pavé diamonds and pearls. “I was inspired by a dialogue with the human form,” Khouri says. “The shapes of these pieces follow the lines of the body.” There are cuffs that appear to climb inside the ear and slink their way out of the lobe, and rings that “better frame the curves of the fingers.” Inspired by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Alberto Giacometti, Khouri explains that she aims to “call attention to the lines of the thing — and not the person who is wearing it.” To that effect, the DSMNY installation features live models, veiled and wearing the pieces over their fabric-draped skin — so that viewers only, as Khouri puts it, “focus only on what is essential.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/jewelry-ana-khouri-dover-street-market/

We follow him from childhood, when his instinct to perform at school leads to cautionary messages from his mother about government “morality police.” Later he attends the Saba Art and Cultural Institute and then a university in Tehran, where friends (played by Tom Cullen, Marama Corlett and Bamshad Abedi-Amin, among others) and a love interest (Freida Pinto) join him in a kind of secret college dance club.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/movies/review-desert-dancer-tells-the-story-of-the-afshin-ghaffarian.html

2015-04-10,Italy: Man Kills 3 at Court During Bankruptcy Hearing," A man at a hearing in a fraudulent bankruptcy opened fire in a Milan courthouse on Thursday, killing a judge, a lawyer and a co-defendant and wounding at least two others in an act of “cold premeditation,” Italian officials said. After the hearing began, the officials said, the man, Claudio Giardiello, 57, shot two of his co-defendants, killing one of them, and also killed a lawyer. He then went to the office of a bankruptcy judge and killed him, they said. The officials said they believed that the judge, Fernando Ciampi, had been involved in the bankruptcy case. Another man was shot in the leg. In all, Mr. Giardiello fired 13 shots, they said. “He acted with cold premeditation,” said Tommaso Buonanno, a prosecutor. Mr. Giardiello fled on a scooter but was arrested later in Vimercate, about 19 miles from Milan, where, the police said, he had intended to kill at least one other person. It was unclear how Mr. Giardiello managed to carry a gun into the courthouse. He may have entered through a separate entrance for lawyers and court employees using a false ID, officials said.

The National Weather Service confirmed at least one tornado in the region on Twitter, urging people to “seek shelter immediately.” Initial reports suggested that the northwestern corner of DeKalb County was hardest hit by the storm. It was there that one person was killed in the small town of Fairdale, about 65 miles northwest of Chicago, according to ABC 7 Chicago. In the town of Rochelle, a tornado was said to have struck a restaurant called Grubsteakers, trapping 14 people inside the collapsed building, according to The Daily Chronicle, a newspaper in DeKalb. It reported that all 14 were rescued by firefighters, who were conducting house-to-house checks in the town to make sure there were no further injuries. The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Cook, DuPage and Will Counties in Illinois and Lake County, Ind.

In an Oscar-nominated performance, David Strathairn portrays Murrow during the political turmoil that journalists coped with in the 1940s and ’50s — particularly Murrow’s war of words and images with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Mr. Clooney plays Murrow’s producer and professional partner, Fred Friendly; Frank Langella is his boss, William Paley; and thanks to archival footage, Senator McCarthy plays himself. “ ‘Good Night, and Good Luck’ is a passionate, thoughtful essay on power, truth-telling and responsibility,” A. O.

Because the prevalent military thinking often placed a general at the head of the army, they were killed leading hopeless charges (Lewis Armistead), engaging in skirmishes (J.E.B. Stuart), reconnoitering occupied territory (Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson), mounting impossible offenses (Patrick Cleburne) and sometimes simply sitting their horses (John F. Reynolds). The cost was incalculable; here, after all, were the officers who, political favoritism aside, were presumably the best qualified to achieve their respective armies’ objectives. And yet, they fell in alarming profusion. At the Battle of Franklin alone, six Confederate generals were killed and seven were wounded.

The first step is not to be intimidated. Most tests include two types of questions: relevant ones about a specific incident (“Did you leak classified information to The New York Times?”) and broader so-called control questions (“Have you ever lied to anyone who trusted you?”). The test assumes that an innocent person telling the truth will have a stronger reaction to the control questions than to the relevant ones. Before your test, practice deciphering between the two question types. “Go to the beach” when you hear a relevant question, Williams says.

The death throes have been especially violent in Spain, where the national coal-mining industry was created by royal order in 1621 to exploit the coal basin at Villanueva del Rio y Minas in Seville. In 1990, 167 coal mines employed about 40,000 workers. Today there are roughly 40 active mines, employing fewer than 4,000 miners.

Rita’s prior experience with an illness of her own is relevant to this choice: When repeated prayer “treatments” failed to give her relief from a painful ovarian cyst, she allowed physicians to operate. But she was viewed as having abandoned her faith. She was no longer permitted to lead church meetings or teach Sunday school. To Rita this loss of community was profound, and perhaps explains why, as her baby was getting worse, she did not seek medical care.

On the evidence here, Treuer believes in bravery. Moreover, he believes that a lack of bravery isn’t just sad, it’s deeply destructive — and the destruction can’t be undone. Cowardice can kill people. While there’s much hope in this lyrical novel, as evidenced by the freedom with which it examines some of the more transgressive interstices of race, sexual orientation and gender, there’s also an obdurate insistence on taking responsibility, particularly if one is a man.

The Dutch designer Iris van Herpen, like West, is invested in the limitless possibilities of clothes. Alice Gregory details the unorthodox methods — including tapping scientists and even the military for inspiration — she has used to bring her high-tech pieces to the mainstream. And in New York City, Lisa Cohen catches up with the pioneering performance and video artist Joan Jonas, who, at 78, is making some of the most inspired, challenging work of her career. Elsewhere, Raf Simons invites T into his atelier at Dior, where the only thing tighter than the deadlines are the designer’s relationships with his devoted staff; Walter Kirn pens an impassioned essay about the meaning of memory in the age of smartphones; we visit a real-life Grand Budapest Hotel (this one’s in the Swiss Alps), where Old World charm and a lack of sleek amenities are the very things keeping guests coming back; the New York City Ballet gets the “By the Numbers” treatment; and the merveilleux, a delectable bite-size pastry perfected by years of experimentation in France, finds a sweet new spot in the West Village.

2015-04-13,New Mexico: Governor Signs Bill on Civil Forfeiture,"Gov. Susana Martinez signed a bill Friday virtually ending the practice of civil forfeiture, making the state a leader in sharply restricting a contentious policy that critics say deprives citizens of due process and gives law enforcement a profit motive. “This is landmark legislation to protect people’s property and due process rights,” said Lee McGrath, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian civil rights group that has long campaigned against the practice. The law preserves criminal forfeiture, in which assets tied to crime can be taken if the owner is convicted. In a letter to lawmakers, Governor Martinez said the law improved constitutional protections even as she said that forfeiture funds had helped “in keeping our communities safe and in protecting our officers from harm.” Only one other state, North Carolina, does not permit civil forfeiture, but law enforcement officials there can still profit from forfeitures by cooperating with federal agents, Mr. McGrath said. The New Mexico law seeks to end such profit-sharing in cases where the assets are valued at less than $50,000. Civil forfeiture, in which law enforcement officials can take possession of property they believe is tied to criminal activity without filing charges or winning a conviction, has come under fire as abuses have been widely chronicled in the news media and the federal government has taken steps to curb the process.

2015-04-13,What’s on TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (HBO) X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (2014) This franchise’s latest entry finds Professor X (played as an older man by Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) besieged by the Sentinels, human-designed robots who travel in coffin-shaped airships and are able to neutralize the mutants’ genetic advantages. Enter Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), who are sent back to the 1970s, when the Paris peace talks are ending the Vietnam War, to prevent the things from being invented. But first they’ll have to rouse Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), the future Professor X, from a drug-addled stupor; spring Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the future Magneto, from prison, where he’s been languishing since being blamed for the Kennedy assassination; and track down the angry bright-blue, shape-shifting Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), also known as Raven. “The logic of the story — a time-travel pretzel that strains after the brain-teasing power of an old ‘Star Trek’ episode — requires too many variables” — and too much thought from the audience, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But “the actors tackle the roles without winking or condescension, and it is nice to see them together again, however distracting the circumstances. They will, of course, return, since in the superhero world, as in the real one, some problems can never really be solved, only put to rest in between episodes.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Her songs reach from personal experience toward social concerns, and they’re calmly assertive, never strident. The music traverses the Americas, from old school hip-hop to Andean flutes, and Ms. Tijoux’s tough-minded rhymes lead into lilting choruses. This week she plays three New York shows: two headlining club dates and a third as part of “Gracias a la Vida: The Rebel Spirit of Chile’s Legendary Voice,” a tribute to the crusading folklorist and songwriter Violeta Parra that is starting a United States tour.

So far, Mr. Nelsons, the 36-year-old Latvian dynamo who began his tenure in Boston in the fall, has won consistent praise for his energy, expertise and charisma. He has yet to reveal a clear artistic vision for the ensemble. The programs he has chosen for these Carnegie concerts suggest that he is still cautious about contemporary music.

2015-04-13,A Star Turn In a Diva Portrait,"“Gloria,” a screen biography of Gloria Trevi, the rebellious pop diva widely viewed as Mexico’s Madonna, would be worth seeing if for no other reason than for the tempestuous performance of its star Sofía Espinosa. With its dry-eyed view of the seamier side of show business, it is a superior pop-star portrait. Ms. Espinosa’s ferocious performance evokes both Madonna and Miley Cyrus. At its heart is the fraught relationship between Ms. Trevi, who had her first hit in 1989, and her domineering Svengali, Sergio Andrade (Marco Pérez), who managed a stable of young female singers some of whom were underage. In 2000, Ms. Trevi, Mr. Andrade and a backup singer were arrested in Rio de Janeiro on charges of corrupting minors, sexual abuse and kidnapping.

(HBO) GAMES OF THRONES  A fifth season begins as Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) takes the road to Dorne to retrieve Myrcella (Nell Tiger Free), his niece-daughter. Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) and Podrick Payne (Daniel Portman) are chasing Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), who is still under the protection of Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen, above, with Ms. Turner). And Arya (Maisie Williams) and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) have crossed the Narrow Sea to Essos, perhaps bringing resolution for Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), who has been cut off from the main cast for 40 episodes. “Quibbles aside, ‘Game of Thrones’ is still remarkable for both the scrupulousness and the lavishness of its production, beautiful to look at and mostly engaging to follow, though there is something of the accountant’s method in Mr. Martin’s fantasy — progress through constant addition — that transfers into the television show,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times, referring to George R. R. Martin, on whose books the series is based. And while the beginning of Season 5 is a building period, without the big jolts that came early in Season 4, “we can trust that the blood will flow more copiously before long.” In the new season of “Silicon Valley,” at 10, Richard (Thomas Middleditch) and the rest of the Pied Piper team find their future jeopardized by big changes at their competitors, Raviga and Nucleus.

2015-04-14,What’s on TV Tuesday,"7:10 P.M. (Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney also directed and stars in as Mike Morris, a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a strategist who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful father and a secret that could derail Stephen’s career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are advisers battling for Stephen’s loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. “Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimon’s play “Farragut North,” loosely based on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential primary campaign. “As an actor he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work,” Mr. Scott added. “But the parts of ‘The Ides of March’ — quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkin-esque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room — are greater than the whole.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Jane has been haunted all her adult life by a terrible event that occurred when she was just 15: A 5-year-old girl, Lily, went missing while Jane was minding her and was never found. In that other, long-ago time, another girl disappeared, on the day two of those incarcerated in the asylum made a temporary breakout.

So when the Brooklyn Museum tapped Kassem, for the second year, to create an installation for tonight’s annual Brooklyn Artists Ball, she knew what to do as soon as she saw that Murakami (along with Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kiki Smith) is one of the event’s honored artists. “The way his finish is, it sort of gives me the illusion of being one giant gumball with flowers in it,” Kassem says of Murakami’s slick, vivid paintings. “So what’s something else we can do with it? Of course, 10,000 gumballs into flowers was the answer!”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/t-magazine/brooklyn-artists-ball-murakami.html

2015-04-15,What’s on TV Wednesday,"3:30 P.M. (HBO2) THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005) In this political thriller directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted from the John le Carré novel, Ralph Fiennes portrays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat (and diligent caretaker of his plants), and Rachel Weisz is Tessa, his wife, whom he meets during a lecture on foreign policy when she angrily challenges Britain’s participation in the Iraq war. Throughout most of the movie Tessa is shown in flashbacks; she has been murdered in the Kenyan wilderness, where she traveled with a Belgian doctor of African ancestry (Hubert Koundé) to help fight poverty and disease. Danny Huston plays Justin’s colleague, and Bill Nighy is a villain in this tale about the evils lurking in multinational corporations and the Western governments that enable them. “It may be best to take the cloak-and-dagger elements of ‘The Constant Gardener,’ and the vision of justice with which it concludes, as metaphors, symbolic crystallizations of a reality too complex and diffuse to be dramatized by more empirical means,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Justin Quayle, then, is an allegorical figure, an emblem of timid virtue roused to heroic action by the discovery of his own complicity with evil.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

I then went to buy lunch, and realized I lost my money. I ran back to the bathroom, but the money was gone. I went to security, but it was not turned in. I later told the story at a staff dinner. The next day, a staff member told me I would be happy to hear the money went to a good cause: her “down-and-out” patient, a struggling 25-year-old woman, with a bad knee injury, who had lost her job. Apparently she came in to our department to declare how happy she was to find $50 the previous day, and felt her luck was finally turning around. The timing of her coming into the bathroom was exact. My colleague said she was about to tell her she might know the money’s owner, but felt she did not want to spoil the woman’s happiness. She also said, knowing me and how I care for my patients who are needy (I often help patients buy needed equipment), that I would want the woman to have the money. Did she do the right thing? NAME WITHHELD, TORONTO",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/magazine/can-a-colleague-donate-my-lost-money.html
2015-04-15,The Man Who Makes the World’s Funniest People Even Funnier,"Melissa McCarthy, her hands tied behind her back, writhed on the dingy basement floor of an abandoned power plant in Budapest — grunting, shrieking and, despite her best efforts, laughing. “Let me try that again,” she said, attempting a straight face. McCarthy was shooting Scene 114 in “Spy,” an action comedy that was, in April 2014, partway through its first week of production. A few feet away was the director Paul Feig, who likes to feed actors new lines of dialogue from just outside the frame. Feig gave McCarthy a breakthrough ensemble role in “Bridesmaids” (2011) and later cast her opposite Sandra Bullock in “The Heat” (2013). In “Spy,” McCarthy is the star, playing an unlikely secret agent called Susan Cooper. In Scene 114, Susan has been apprehended and dumped in the basement alongside another captive, named Aldo — a disconcertingly libidinal ally who keeps hitting on Susan despite their dire circumstances. The scene builds toward some exquisitely clumsy physical comedy, as Susan commands Aldo to help untie her, even though he is also in knots, inaugurating a grabby ballet and creating numerous opportunities for Aldo to say sleazy things.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/magazine/the-man-who-makes-the-worlds-funniest-people-even-funnier.html

But now, at age 77, the faith that she held on to seemed to be slipping in the face of her pain, prognosis and impending demise. Faith that was held together by an unyielding thread of hope.

And Mr. McVicar’s daring concept for its traditional companion piece, Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci,” may prod those who think they know this 1892 tale about a hardscrabble troupe of roving commedia dell’arte players to think again: Mr. McVicar zaps the setting from late-1860s Calabria to a grimy truck stop in the late 1940s in what could be any bustling Italian town; the players become a troupe of zany vaudevillians.

2015-04-16,Sally Mann’s Exposure,"In September 1992, I published my third book of photographs, “Immediate Family.” The book contained 60 photographs from a decade-­long series of more than 200 pictures of my children, Emmett, Jessie and Virginia, who were about 6, 4 and 1 when I started the project. The photographs show them going about their lives, sometimes without clothing, on our farm tucked into the Virginia hills. For miles in all directions, there was not a breathing soul. When we were on the farm, we were isolated, not just by geography but by the primitive living conditions: no electricity, no running water and, of course, no computer, no phone. Out of a conviction that my lens should remain open to the full scope of their childhood, and with the willing, creative participation of everyone involved, I photographed their triumphs, confusion, harmony and isolation, as well as the hardships that tend to befall children — bruises, vomit, bloody noses, wet beds — all of it.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/magazine/the-cost-of-sally-manns-exposure.html

A small library of searching and sensational stories attests to the strong, often uncomfortable affinity between reporters and killers. Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood” is perhaps the supreme example, and one that has inspired several movies over the years. Neither Michael Finkel’s book “True Story” nor Rupert Goold’s film adaptation is anywhere near as accomplished as Capote’s book or Bennett Miller’s movie “Capote.” The new film is of interest mainly because it demonstrates just how difficult it can be to map the queasy moral territory where crime and journalism intersect.

That’s the neighborhood in which the heroine, Alex (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), grew up and that, with her family, she still calls home. She may not notice the carnival anymore, but the director, Chris Messina, takes time to gently point out some of the more picturesque sites, like the Venice sign that serves as a gateway to the Pacific and the arched walkways that Orson Welles immortalized in “Touch of Evil.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/movies/review-in-alex-of-venice-a-career-workaholic-learns-to-shoulder-family-burdens.html

Sullivan speaks of his practice with sharp, fine-tuned language. “I’m trying to deal with these parameters that I’ve set in front of me and the event of making this thing,” says the 32-year-old Rhode Island School of Design graduate. “There’s something closely linked between the image that you see, the process of making it and the material. There’s nothing else. There’s no subject matter tacked on top of that, it’s much more about how closely those things can be bound together.” This week, Sullivan opens his first solo and American institutional exhibition at Miami’s Institute of Contemporary Art — the institution founded by former employees of the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, that’s lately been closely watched in the art world after its recent move to the Design District (on the second floor of the charming 1912 Moore building) and appointment of a not-yet-30-year-old deputy director and chief curator (Alex Gartenfeld, a former Art in America editor).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/ryan-sullivan-ica-miami/

In 1959, a group of formerly true-believing Romanian Communists, all Jewish, did the unthinkable when they robbed a branch of the state (and only) bank. They were soon caught, but the story went from curious to crackpot when officials decided that the robbers would portray themselves in a state-produced film titled “Reconstruction,” recreating their gangsta roles with secret meetings, gats and getaway cars.

A decade or so ago, when art dealers started to set up shop below East Houston Street, a vague hope beat in the hearts of some observers that the neighborhood might be an alternative, in art and attitude alike, to Chelsea. I doubt anyone harbors that hope today. Mostly, the Lower East Side gallery scene is Chelsea with more storefronts and cheaper retail.

2015-04-17,What’s On TV Friday,"8:10 P.M. (Starz Cinema) FOOTNOTE (2012) The tension-filled relationship between rival Talmudic scholars — Eliezer (Shlomo Bar Aba, above), who toils in obscurity under the belief that his career was blocked by a nemesis, and Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi), an academic star with a busy schedule of public lectures — becomes more complicated when Eliezer is mistakenly awarded a coveted prize meant for Uriel, who happens to be his son. But how to correct the error? Under the direction of Joseph Cedar, the American-born Israeli director, “the fraught relations between father and son erupt into an intergenerational tsimmes worthy of Shakespeare, Freud or the more melodramatic portions of the Hebrew Bible,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. “It plays as farce, but the chords of family tragedy resonate underneath the laughter.” Resolution, he added, “is unlikely, which may or may not be cause for optimism. Academic life and family life are both built on love — the love of learning, the love of other people — but they survive on contention, renewing and extending quarrels from one generation to the next.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2015-04-17,How to Negotiate a Ransom,"“Make sure they’re alive first,” says Leslie Edwards, a top hostage negotiation specialist and former British Army officer. Demand to speak to the captive on the phone, or better still, on video chat. If that is not possible, ask the abductor to answer what Edwards calls a “proof-of-life question,” something only the kidnapped would know, like the name of a pet goldfish. Ransom amounts vary widely. At the high end, Edwards once settled at $10 million to secure the release of 26 crew members aboard an oil tanker held by Somali pirates, but he has also freed a detainee in Afghanistan for less than $10,000. A counteroffer to the first ransom demands should be a result of exhaustive research. “You don’t need to know their names, but you need to know their modus operandi and their track record,” Edwards says. Whether the hostage-takers’ motives are purely mercenary or derive from a more dangerous mix of ideology, politics and greed, this is not the time to be a cheapskate. “Make a decent opening offer that puts value on the life of the hostage,” he says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/magazine/how-to-negotiate-a-ransom.html

This is their moment in the midnight sun: Our cover next week will feature new books by Karl Ove Knausgaard, Per Petterson and Asne Seierstad, while Jo Nesbo turns up at No. 9 on the hardcover fiction list with his latest crime novel, “Blood on Snow.” Nesbo is of course a regular on the best-­seller pages, thanks to his Harry Hole mystery series, but “Blood on Snow” — about a 1970s hit man who falls in love with his target — is a stand-alone. It was inspired, Nesbo has said, by his desire to do for Oslo what Jim Carroll did for New York in “The Basketball Diaries”: “He makes Manhattan feel dangerous but also small,” Nesbo told The Yorkshire Post earlier this month. “Any big city will have its darker side, it’s inevitable, and Oslo is no different. . . . On the other hand my Oslo is a little bit more twisted and darker, a bit like Gotham City is a darker version of New York.” Nesbo is often grouped with the Swedish writers Stieg Larsson and Henning Mankell as exemplars of a recent wave of Nordic noir, but he told the newspaper he’s at a loss to explain the phenomenon: “People ask me, What is it with Scandinavian crime fiction? And I’ve been trying to come up with a smart answer, but I really don’t know.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-04-20,What’s on TV Saturday,"9 P.M. (CUNY) THE CLAY BIRD (2003) City Cinematheque’s tribute to Milestone Films continues with Tareque Masud’s drama, set in Bangladesh in the 1960s, about Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu), a shy young boy from rural East Pakistan who is sent to an Islamic school by his father (Jayanto Chattopadhyay), who doesn’t want his son tainted by the outside world. Anu struggles to conform to the school’s monastic ways, and to be accepted by the cliquish boys. But soon he gravitates to the enthusiastic oddball Roko (Russell Farazi), the one student who refuses to go along with the program. “Mr. Masud’s expansive fluidity is rapturous, inspired equally by the floating equanimity of Satyajit Ray and the work of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who deftly uses ritual behavior to provide social commentary,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. “It’s also evident that Mr. Masud loves all his characters, even the small-minded ones — the sign of a real director. It’s no small achievement to make a picture that extols the necessity for clear, free thought while dramatizing the barriers that challenge such a capacity.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2015-04-20,What’s On Sunday,"5:30 P.M.

Paul Dano, Ms. Kazan’s real-life partner, is Calvin, a literary whiz kid turned blocked writer who breathes life into this figment of his imagination, and then directs her every move. “ ‘Ruby Sparks,’ directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the team behind ‘Little Miss Sunshine,’ has the same zany and sweet tone laced with just enough hardheaded wisdom to keep it grounded in psychological truth,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “The screenplay, by Ms. Kazan, is so polished and witty that it immediately puts her in the same league as Diablo Cody. And Ms. Kazan’s lovely, tart performance is the equal of Ellen Page’s portrayal of the title character in ‘Juno.’ Both are impetuous screwball heroines who could have been created only by women.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/arts/whats-on-sunday.html

Since most Swiss have a pronounced aversion to snails — on the dinner table, anyway — the new law is interpreted here as a riposte against the neighboring French department of the Doubs. Snail, smothered in garlic butter and baked, are a favorite dish of the French, and the people of the Doubs are accused of crossing the border to hunt for the escargots that the Swiss don’t use. Police have been authorized to search cars, suitcases and gamebags for contraband snails.

Furniture companies set up incredibly elaborate booths at the fairgrounds to showcase their newest products, international designers band together to install their contemporary wares in centuries-old palazzos and villas, and local gallerists like Rossana Orlandi and Nina Yashar become curatorial tours de force, putting on their best and biggest shows of the year.

2015-04-20,What’s on TV Monday,"10:15 A.M. (Starz Cinema) MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003) In the first of three Russell Crowe movies, Mr. Crowe stars as Capt. Jack Aubrey, commander of a British frigate whose crew must battle a faster, larger French vessel off the South American coast during the Napoleonic wars. Paul Bettany is the ship’s surgeon — so deft he operates on his own abdomen — and the sensitive foil to Aubrey’s ferocity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that Peter Weir’s vigorous adaptation of the Patrick O’Brien series, with land-based scenes filmed on the Galápagos Islands, “hums with humor, passion and life.” He added, “It makes you wish Napoleon were still around, so we — that is, I mean, the British Empire — could beat him all over again.” In “Winter’s Tale” (2014), at 12:45 p.m. on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe plays a gangster in early- 20th-century New York intent on putting asunder the love between a consumptive rich girl (Jessica Brown Findlay) and a thief (Colin Farrell). “A thin line separates the magical from the preposterous, and by insisting so strenuously on its own magic, ‘Winter’s Tale’ pitches helplessly into earnest ridiculousness,” Mr. Scott wrote about this adaptation by Akiva Goldsman of Mark Helprin’s best seller. And in “A Good Year” (2006), at 2:45 on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe portrays Max Skinner, an aggressive London bond trader who inherits a small vineyard from his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney). Soon enough, Max, soothed by the memories of summers spent amid the grapevines, has morphed into a bon vivant and fallen for a beautiful bistro owner (Marion Cotillard). Then a young Californian (Abbie Cornish) shows up and announces that she is his uncle’s previously unknown daughter — which would make her Henry’s true heir. In his review of this Ridley Scott adaptation of the Peter Mayle novel, Stephen Holden advised viewers “to make a reservation at an upscale French restaurant immediately after seeing the film or risk going home feeling deprived.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

2015-04-20,"‘The Road to Character,’ by David Brooks","David Brooks’s gift — as he might put it in his swift, engaging way — is for making obscure but potent social studies research accessible and even startling, for seeing consistency as the hobgoblin of little minds and for ranging as widely across the private domain as the public. There aren’t many writers on politics who will study “emotional intelligence” as closely as they do polls, and fewer still extol failure as enthusiastically as they do success. Brooks’s flaws, as he tells us with typical cheerfulness and ease at the beginning of his new book, are that “I was born with a natural disposition toward shallowness” and “I’m paid to be a narcissistic blowhard” (the admission itself, of course, taking some of the edge off that “narcissistic”). He is, in short, a near-ideal public commentator (for this paper and for many other media outlets) because he is happy to sacrifice complexity and nuance in order to spin a hyper-readable, lucid, often richly detailed human story that sounds far less shrill and ad hominem than most of the polarizing rants of the day.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/books/review/the-road-to-character-by-david-brooks.html

The Danish people had bravely defied their Nazi occupiers throughout the war and saved almost all of the nation’s Jews. In 1944, the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal published a groundbreaking critique of the racism faced by African-­Americans in the United States. Myrdal’s study, “An American Dilemma,” greatly influenced President Truman’s executive order to integrate the United States military, the Supreme Court’s ruling on behalf of school desegregation, and the creation of the modern civil rights movement. In 1964, Gunnar Jahn, a former leader of the Norwegian resistance to the Nazis, handed Martin Luther King Jr. the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo. Jahn expressed the hope that “conflicts between races, nations and political systems can be solved, not by fire and sword, but in a spirit of true brotherly love.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/books/review/asne-seierstads-one-of-us-about-rampage-in-norway.html

Mr. Carter, 90, called for an international investigation into Israel’s prosecution of the war and renewed his plea to remove Hamas from Washington’s list of terrorist groups. Jason Pearlman, a spokesman for President Reuven Rivlin of Israel, said Mr. Rivlin had declined Mr. Carter’s request to meet based on the Foreign Ministry’s counsel. When Mr. Carter visited Jerusalem in 2012 with a group of former leaders called The Elders, he met with Shimon Peres, then president, but said he had been denied meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet.

Whenever the director Vittorio De Sica joins forces with Ms. Loren, “something wonderful happens,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times about this flamboyant Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. “The something wonderful that’s happened is the conception and projection of a film so frank and free and understanding of a certain kind of vital woman — and man, too — that it sends you forth from the theater feeling you’ve known her — and him — all your life.” A short film directed by Ms. Loren’s son Edoardo Ponti, “Human Voice” (2014), based on the Jean Cocteau play about a woman’s final telephone conversation with her lover, leads in at 8 p.m.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

As Balz puts it, “people don’t like their own party any more or less than they used to, but they dislike the other party much more.” Or to quote Chait: Today’s “voters form strong loyalties based more on loathing for the opposing party than on the old kind of tribal loyalty (‘My daddy was a Democrat, his daddy was a Democrat …’) that used to prevail. The party system has split along racial, cultural, and religious lines, creating a kind of tribal system where each party’s supports regard the other side with incomprehension and loathing.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/fear-and-loathing-in-american-politics/

2015-04-23,What’s on TV Thursday,"1:30 A.M. (Flix) THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (2002) Four Roman Catholic Irish teenagers (Anne-Marie Duff; Dorothy Duffy; Nora-Jane Noone; and Eileen Walsh) are sentenced in the late 1960s to toil in convent laundries run by the Sisters of the Magdalene as punishment for sexual misconduct in this semifictional story. (The existence of these religious labor camps, which 30,000 women are thought to have endured, came to light in the ’70s with the discovery of the unmarked graves of some who lived there; the last laundry was closed in 1996.) Geraldine McEwan plays Sister Bridget, the twisted head nun — with a soft spot for “The Bells of St. Mary’s” and John F. Kennedy — who turns into a demon if her rules are flouted. “ ‘The Magdalene Sisters’ would be too painful to watch if it didn’t have a silver lining,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, which was written and directed by Peter Mullan and won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. “Suffice it to say that it is possible to fly over this religious cuckoo’s nest and remain free. All it takes is courage and the timely kindness of strangers.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Your progress is not a line, direct or winding, from one point to another, but a flickering series of scenes. A street is not only its tarred surface, the buildings alongside it, the cars fast or slow, the people around you. It is also the way those things relate to one another, the way they combine and recombine. As some elements slip out of view, new ones become visible: You are moving, the cars are moving, other people are moving, even the sun is moving, slowly, and in the middle of this movable feast you must decide when to press the shutter, decide which of these rapidly refreshing instants is more interesting than the others around it. A second before, it has not yet arrived. A second later, it is already gone. Henri Cartier-Bresson called it “a joint operation of the brain, the eye and the heart.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/magazine/lee-friedlander-captures-the-citys-hustle-and-flow.html

He does not remember hitting the asphalt (he landed on his head), but he recalls stumbling to a slender median dividing Atlantic and saying out loud, to no one in particular, “Please let me live, please let me live.” He was bleeding from the back of his head, but he felt little pain, only a numbness in his arm, which was the first clue, paramedics eventually told him, that he probably had spinal damage.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/magazine/how-do-we-protect-new-york-citys-pedestrians.html

But I wasn’t allowed to ride the train. It took a half-hour to walk to the subway stop, and you’d have to walk through Canarsie — ungentrifiable, unimprovable Canarsie — past a lot of questionable landmarks. There was the convenience store where my mother sent me to buy Kents, and whose clerk would ask if I’d like a lighter, then offer me one with a photo of a naked lady on it. And the pharmacy, which was also maybe a methadone clinic, where I picked up my mother’s still-prescription-only nicotine patches for use during the Sabbath, when she wasn’t allowed to smoke.

In those early days, my wife, Eileen, and I discovered that despite all there was to do in the city on Saturday nights, the thing we liked most was to stay home and cook for each other. We owned two cookbooks; the one we favored was “Northern Italian Cooking,” by Francesco Ghedini (an intensely serious cookbook whose heartsick, newly widowed author committed suicide before completing it). Our favorite Ghedini recipes were heavy on pork sausages. If you were going to buy pork, that meant you went to Esposito’s pork shop on Ninth Avenue and 38th. You went nowhere else. So on Saturday afternoons, I would start at our apartment and walk south, entering Riverside Park on 107th, crossing over on 96th and then continuing in the park all the way down to 72nd. In my memory of those walks, it is always late afternoon in autumn, the sun is just visible through a mesh of thick, darkening clouds: that time of day and weather that evokes young, headstrong New York to me.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/magazine/street-romance.html

As part of my research for a book about New York’s origins, I was trying to locate the Dutch city of New Amsterdam on the grid of the financial district.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/magazine/the-old-haunts.html
2015-04-23,The Walking Cure,"My father was a great walker. It was his only sport and his only pastime, if you don’t count reading or going to synagogue.

It’s summer, and the streets of Corona swell with Muslims — men and young boys in new salwar kameez, sent special from family in Pakistan; women and girls, too, in reds, aquas and silvers, the kind usually found in the tails of mermaids and peacocks. We are headed early in the morning to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. For the month of Ramadan, we fasted from sunrise to sunset, spending our days in spiritual remembrance.

But the stamp of Moses, the subject of Caro’s 1974 biography, “The Power Broker,” still in print, is inescapable in the city where Caro has lived — and walked — for most of his life. Moses displaced at least 250,000 people to build expressways, Caro likes to point out, and another 250,000 for slum clearance and urban renewal. Half a million New Yorkers.

2015-04-24,Inside the List,"The Power Brokers: As a longtime political journalist for ABC News and a contributor to NPR’s “Morning Edition,” Cokie Roberts regularly dissects the power dynamics of modern-day Washington. As an author, though, she’s demonstrated a special regard for the farther reaches of American history and its behind-the-scenes players — especially, in best sellers like “Founding Mothers” and “Ladies of Liberty,” the political wives of the early Republic. Now she looks back to the Civil War era in “Capital Dames,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. “These women were lobbied by favor-seekers or bill-passer-seekers or just individuals,” she said recently on NPR. “They would be the person who had the ear of the powerful man more than anyone else. . . . It’s really remarkable how much we do the same things century in, century out. You recognize their concern about their children; you recognize their interest in fashion; you recognize the jewelry that they’re wearing. Mary Lincoln’s pearls were on display at the Library of Congress the other night; I would have loved to take them out of the case and put them on. But you also recognize their intelligence and their political sensibility.” All of this inevitably calls to mind a terrific play that ran at Lincoln Center last year, “The City of Conversation,” by the underappreciated novelist and playwright Anthony Giardina, tracking several decades in the life of a fictional capital dame. “We’re an arm of the government, you might say,” Giardina’s stalwart heroine declares of Washington’s hostess class. “Or we were. And will be again.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/inside-the-list.html

After Chilean officials evacuated thousands of people from the surrounding area, the ash cloud wrought havoc as it drifted across the Andes, causing airport, road and school closings in Argentina’s provinces, and jeopardizing a gubernatorial election scheduled for Sunday.

2015-04-27,What’s on TV Saturday,"8 P.M. (Showtime) BOYHOOD (2014) Starting in 2002, Richard Linklater began to film four characters — a boy (Ellar Coltrane), then 6; his sister (Lorelei Linklater, Mr. Linklater’s daughter); and their parents (the Oscar-winning Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, in a nominated role) — over 12 consecutive years, composing the script as the movie progressed. “What emerged from those dozen years is a series of meticulously textured and structured scenes set to the rhythm of life,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Siblings argue. A mother struggles with men, paying the bills and earning several college degrees. An estranged father roars into his children’s lives in a 1968 GTO. “The story in ‘Boyhood’ is blissfully simple: A child grows up,” Ms. Dargis added about this film, which also earned Oscar nominations for best picture, directing, original screenplay and editing. “This, along with the modesty of its physical production — its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives — can obscure Mr. Linklater’s ambitions and the greatness of his achievement.” But in his masterpiece, she said, “he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isn’t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

DJ Spoko and Nozinja, both from South Africa, have created fast-paced versions of Kwaito house; Islam Chipsy, from Egypt, plays blistering, distorted electro chaabi, using his fists to make tone clusters on his electronic keyboard over rhythm tracks; Titica, a popular transgender Angolan singer and dancer, performs the rap-techno style called kuduro.

Chaplin released this silent masterwork more than three years into the sound era at great personal risk — and to resounding acclaim. (32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village; anthologyfilmarchives.org.)

2015-04-27,New Portraits by Chantal Joffe at the Jewish Museum,"Susan Sontag wrote that “the painter constructs, the photographer discloses.” But the work of photography-based painters like Chantal Joffe (her early interest in nudes led her to paint mostly from pictures in pornographic magazines) has always existed somewhere in between, a fictive nonfiction. Starting Friday, the Jewish Museum will present 34 new portraits by Ms. Joffe of Jewish women of the 20th century whose contributions to art, literature and politics have interested her. The redoubtable group includes Sontag, as well as Diane Arbus, Gertrude Stein and Claude Cahun, the Surrealist shape-shifter whose photographic self-portraits as a man, amid many other guises, prefigured Cindy Sherman by decades. Ms. Joffe made the portraits after immersing herself not only in pictures of the women but also in what they wrote and made, striving for depictions charged with her own imagining of what her heroes would have looked like at various stages of their lives.

2015-04-27,"‘The Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune, 1915-1964,’ by Zachary Leader","The very long first volume of Zachary Leader’s biography of Saul Bellow — a second book will cover the later years — ends in 1964, with the publication of “Herzog,” the novel that secured Bellow’s position, at age 49, as the more or less undisputed champ of midcentury American fiction. The country was becoming steadily citified, and Bellow — born outside Montreal, raised in Chicago, at home in Manhattan — was the laureate of the new urban cosmos. “Mr. Bellow has something like a genius for place,” V. S. Pritchett marveled in The New York Review of Books. “There is not a descriptive insinuator of what a city like New York is like from minute to minute who comes anywhere near him. Some novelists stage it, others document it; he is breathing in it.” The big ideas and Great Books blurtings of Moses Herzog, a cuckolded professor and “poor soldier of culture” who goes on a half-crazed ­letter-writing spree (“Dear Doktor Professor Heideg­ger”), bounce like molecules off the shifting surfaces and bristling planes of Manhattan: the crowded sidewalks and pinched apartments, the humps of brown rock “speckled with mica” in Central Park, glimpsed between the blinds of an Upper West Side doctor’s office whose “dark walls seemed swollen with the disease of old buildings in New York.” Dropping his subway fare in the slot, Herzog sees “a whole series of tokens lighted from within and magnified by the glass” and notes that “innumerable millions of passengers had polished the wood of the turnstile with their hips.” In Bellow’s urban pastoral, mass human activity both exhilarates and terrifies, duplicating nature’s impersonal patterned randomness — as “megatons of water shape organisms on the ocean floor. As tides polish stones. As winds hollow cliffs.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/the-life-of-saul-bellow-to-fame-and-fortune-1915-1964-by-zachary-leader.html
2015-04-27,"‘There Is Simply Too Much to Think About,’ Saul Bellow’s Nonfiction","“The flies wait hungrily in the air,” writes Saul Bellow (in a description of Shawneetown in southern Illinois), “sheets of flies that make a noise like the tearing of tissue paper.” Go and tear some tissue paper in two, ­slowly: It sounds just like the sullen purr of bristling vermin. But how, you wonder, did Bellow know what torn tissue paper sounded like in the first place? And then you wonder what this minutely vigilant detail is doing in Holiday magazine (in 1957), rather than in the work in progress, “Henderson the Rain King” (1959). It or something even better probably is in “Henderson.” For Bellow’s fictional and nonfictional voices intertwine and cross-pollinate. This is from a film review of 1962: “There she is, stout and old, a sinking, squarish frame of bones.” Two decades later the image would effloresce in the story/novella “Cousins”:",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/there-is-simply-too-much-to-think-about-saul-bellows-nonfiction.html

At least that’s what Friedrich Nietzsche suggested in “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” when he described a three-step development of the human spirit. First, the human psyche has the form of a camel because it takes on the heavy burden of cultural duties — ethical obligations, social rank, and the weight of tradition. Next, the camel transforms into a lion, which represents the rebellion of the psyche — the “holy nay” that frees a rule-governed person from slavish obedience to authority. Finally, this negative insurgent phase evolves into the highest level of humanity, symbolized as the playing child — innocent and creative, the “holy yea.” Cue the Richard Strauss music.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/reclaiming-the-power-of-play/

But three new restaurants in the capital — Hoja Santa, Niño Viejo and Oaxaca — reflect the city’s growing culinary curiosity, and just how gastronomically cosmopolitan it has become during the last few years.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/t-magazine/traditional-mexican-food-barcelona-adria.html

His “Drum and Bass” series entailed placing red, yellow and blue objects on black shelves to resemble Piet Mondrian’s compositions; Mercier has also constructed sculptures from stacked boxes of Glad trash bags and Aim toothpaste. “You can make masterpieces with what you have in your room,” he claims. “Everything is there — it’s how to make sense of it.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/t-magazine/diamants-mathieu-mercier-show.html

The company was founded in 2004 by Franco Gazzani and Lewis Cutillo, distant cousins that are part of a family that has been making made-to-measure men’s shoes for nearly a century. In recent years, fashion Goliaths like Tod’s have located their shoe factories here, and many of the small, older family cobblers have all but disappeared. But that hasn’t deterred Gazzani, who still handcrafts men’s shoes with his father and seven employees at the shoe laboratorio in the basement of his own home. “While this is a business, we also think that what we’re doing here is preserving a piece of local history and excellence that is slowly slipping away,” Gazzani says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/t-magazine/bontoni-shoes-italy.html

2015-04-28,"‘Ordinary Light: A Memoir,’ by Tracy K. Smith","In “The Souls of Black Folk” (1903), W. E. B. Du Bois defined the double consciousness of the African-American, the peculiar sensation “of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape” of an alien world. The African-American ever feels his or her two-ness, “two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body.” Segregation placed a veil between the black observer and that other world, the white one. Du Bois’s description of the black individual who is yet American remained apt into the era of increased integration, as shown in various autobiographies that began to appear in the 1990s by young black people who had entered the middle class. The experience of an elite school or a profession was understood as a leaving of the black world. Now we are hearing from the children of those black parents who rent the veil. For them, the Huxtable generation, whiteness may no longer be synonymous with what it is to be American or “normal,” but to be black still means knowing how to survive on what Du Bois elsewhere identified as the “island within.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/ordinary-light-a-memoir-by-tracy-k-smith.html

On this issue, social conservatives have basically experienced the old “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win” process in reverse, and we’re somewhere between the “laugh at you” and the “ignore you” stages — though it remains to be seen whether “then they fine you and tax you and try to shut you down” will be the actual final step.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/the-wild-ideas-of-social-conservatives/

About 1.5 million Armenians were killed during that era in what is now widely regarded as a genocide. The lawsuit, brought in the Constitutional Court of Turkey, is an unprecedented effort by the Armenian Church to use the Turkish legal system to recover property seized 100 years ago, said Payam Akhavan, a former prosecutor at The Hague and the church’s lead international counsel in the case. The suit, filed Monday, came a few days after Armenia officially commemorated the centennial of the genocide.

(MoreMax) TRANCE (2013) Danny Boyle’s thriller begins in an auction house, where a robbery leaves Simon (James McAvoy), an employee charged with safeguarding a Goya, with amnesia and unable to reveal where the painting is. Vincent Cassel plays Franck, the leader of the men behind the heist — and, it turns out, Simon’s business partner. And Rosario Dawson is the hypnotherapist who holds the key to Simon’s memory. “Mr. Boyle, as always, works hard to cast a spell in ‘Trance,’ and his energy and commitment to the audience’s entertainment are evident in every scene,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film from the director of “Trainspotting” and “Slumdog Millionaire.” “But there are times when it feels as if he’s throwing everything at the screen — the throbbing music, bleeding fingers, narrative U-turns and the startling sight of a naked Ms. Dawson striding toward the camera as strategically shorn as a Renaissance nude — less because he wants to distract you from the big reveal than to obscure the material’s thinness.” She added, “That doesn’t lessen the movie’s appeal while you’re watching it, though it drastically shortens the afterglow.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Her photos offer up glimpses of the commonplace turned extraordinary: 1992’s iconic “Immediate Family,” for example, traced the day-to-day lives of her children, growing up on a farm tucked inside Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. Mann’s intimate photos depicted both the innocence and complexity of childhood at the same time that they alluded to larger themes like sexuality and death (and elicited criticism about what kind of mother Mann is, as her children were often depicted without clothes). For “Deep South” (2005), she photographed the Southern landscape so dear to her, exposing its extravagant beauty and its haunting past. And with 2009’s “Proud Flesh,” Mann turned her eye towards her husband of over four decades, in a candid portrait series revealing his once-powerful body, now marked by signs of age and muscular dystrophy; at once a love letter and a testament to time’s merciless passage.

Everybody’s favorite, day-seizing Greek peasant is back in town. “Zorba” — the 1968 musical adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis’s novel “Zorba the Greek” — is the final offering of this season’s Encores! series of musicals in concert at City Center. Featuring a score by John Kander and Fred Ebb (whose “The Visit” recently made its Broadway debut), with a book by Joseph Stein, “Zorba” has had two major New York productions, including a 1983 revival that starred Anthony Quinn, who indelibly played the title character in Michael Cacoyannis’s 1964 film. Stepping into his shoes (or lack thereof) is John Turturro; the supporting cast includes Santino Fontana and Zoe Wanamaker, portraying folks who learn to live, live, live under Zorba’s tutelage. Walter Bobbie directs.

Would he call it a departure? No. Rather, the collection, created alongside Acne Studios and printed with patterns from Schlesinger’s own organic designs, tells “the story of my evolving work, and how they go from one thing to another, but stay the same,” he says. To that end, Acne’s creative director Jonny Johansson also worked with Schlesinger to create a book (essentially, a portfolio) of the artist’s ceramics. Available today, the monograph features photographs of more than 150 sculptures, all shot by Schlesinger’s partner of 40 years, Eric Boman. Some were taken as each piece was completed, “to document them,” Schlesinger explains. “Then they began to be more beautiful as photographs.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/peter-schlesinger-sculptures-acne-studios/

2015-04-30,Iran: Ship’s Seizure Tied to Court Case," Iranian officials on Wednesday sought to play down the significance of Iran’s seizure of a cargo ship a day earlier in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway. The officials said the vessel was owned by a corporate defendant in a civil case in Iran. They denied that the impoundment had been meant to send a belligerent message to other nations over freedom of navigation in the strait. “That’s a legal case,” said Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. “This is not a security issue or political issue.” A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying the action had been taken “in conformity with international regulations.” Some analysts in the United States said the seizure reflected what they called Iran’s desire to show it would not be bullied. Last week, the United States deployed warships near Yemen’s coast, in what was seen as a message to Iranian vessels in the area.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted this month of participating in the bombings and could face the death penalty.

But over the coming decades, as the financial health of the Roman Empire declined — largely because of its increasingly independent army, which demanded ever more money to subdue the rebellious provinces — the emperors began, slowly at first, mixing in copper to stretch the silver further. By 280 A.D., a denarius was 98 percent copper, with a thin silver wash on the surface. The implication was clear to every Roman: Here, in their hands, was a physical manifestation of the empire’s deepening desperation. Whatever proclamations the emperor might make, the coin told the truth.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/in-code-we-trust.html

None of this matters because the most relevant thing about a movie like this is that its quality is almost entirely irrelevant. It was created to crush the box office, entertainment media and audience resistance, and mission, you know, already accomplished. In an age of lock-step entertainment, pushback isn’t just immaterial; it is also suspect.

But in truth, the couple had been coming to L.A. regularly for five years, and decided to move when they realized, as Sorci puts it, that “it was getting harder to leave!” So the partners in life, love and art packed up from Rome and began a new chapter in California, which now includes an exhibition space in West Hollywood and a storied home in the Hollywood Hills — an “old Tudor house that belonged to the actress Anne Baxter,” Sorci explains. “She was the granddaughter of Frank Lloyd Wright, so she asked her grandfather to do some remodeling.” Wright started, “and then passed the job to John Lautner.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/pierpaolo-barzan-valeria-sorci-los-angeles-guide/

A longtime friend of Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver, she has worked with the brand, making music for commercials, runway shows and after-parties, since 2010. She wore Hood by Air in A$AP Rocky’s first major music video, “Peso,” in 2011, and played an integral role in launching its women’s line in fall 2014, creating a live sound installation alongside Fatima Al Qadiri.

Rankling several standards of taste, she reclaims women’s pleasure as their own while sometimes evoking metaphorically the repressions such freedom can invite. “Triptych,” the largest painting in Ms. Yuskavage’s previous solo show at Zwirner (in 2011), suggested the blood sacrifice of one of her sprites by stern pioneer women from the Old West.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/arts/design/review-lisa-yuskavage-at-david-zwirner.html

The Northern Irish, Brooklyn-based artist (he’s exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery, but is perhaps best known for his children’s books and work with U2), had spent months creating a portrait of a middle-aged African American woman grasping a chicken in one hand and a viper in the other. Last night, he dipped it in a vat of green paint, a bright shade of sickly lime enamel, covering all but the top of her head. With that, an assistant passed around shots of whiskey and glasses were raised: “What’s done is done, and what’s to come is to come.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/oliver-jeffers-dipped-paintings-project/

Alice is the program’s guiding creative spirit and also its star, so the content reflects her interests: low-“carbohydrant” cooking, swan figurines, the neutering of dogs, re-enacted episodes of childhood humiliation and, above all, herself. She is both unstable and self-absorbed, and though she has spent years studying the broadcast work of Oprah Winfrey on VHS, Alice’s on-air gestures and intonations can be as awkward as her self-help pronouncements are bizarre. From the start, “Welcome to Me,” shot in front of a sparse audience in the studios of a struggling infomercial outfit, seems to be headed for disaster.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/movies/review-kristen-wiig-as-a-bipolar-lottery-winner-in-welcome-to-me.html
