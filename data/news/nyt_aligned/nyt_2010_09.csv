That question, which has prompted countless academic studies, debates and inter-running-partner squabbles, is now at the heart of a notable new study published in August on the Web site of USA Track and Field, the sport’s national governing body. The study, one of the largest of its kind, involved almost 1,400 runners, from age 13 to past 60, who were assigned randomly to two groups. The first group did not stretch before their runs, while otherwise maintaining their normal workout routine: the same mileage, warm-up (minus any stretching) and so on. The second group stretched, having received photographs and specific instructions for a series of simple, traditional poses, like leaning over and touching toes, that focused on the calf, hamstring and quadriceps muscles. The volunteers were told to hold each stretch for 20 seconds, a technique known as static stretching. The entire routine required three to five minutes and was to be completed immediately before a run.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/phys-ed-does-stretching-before-running-prevent-injuries/

Aptly named (Bar)barian, the collaboration was inspired by what Andi Kovel and Justin Parker of Esque call the ‘‘noble savage’’: objects that were once made from horn, wood and stone are reimagined in glass and leather. Why serve drinks from an ordinary decanter when you could present (Bar)barian’s Flagon, a swirling glass vessel that resembles the horn of some mythical beast? Or why not go all out with the Travel Bar: two hornlike glasses, a bone-shaped stirrer and a leather studded case in which to lug them? Just don’t go hunting for dinner with the OB-J slingshot. Rendered in wood-colored glass with an inelastic leather strap and fragile handle, it’s entirely nonfunctional. But that’s entirely the point: by allowing utility and convenience to go the way of the woolly mammoth, (Bar)barian has transformed objects from the past into up-to-the-minute pieces of pure decadence.

2010-09-02,The Peanut Solution,"Like most tales of great invention, the story of Plumpy’nut begins with a eureka moment, in this case involving a French doctor and a jar of Nutella, and proceeds through the stages of rejection, acceptance, evangelization and mass production. The product may not look like much — a little foil packet filled with a soft, sticky substance — but its advocates are prone to use the language of magic and wonders. What is Plumpy’nut? Sound it out, and you get the idea: it’s an edible paste made of peanuts, packed with calories and vitamins, that is specially formulated to renourish starving children. Since its widespread introduction five years ago, it has been credited with significantly lowering mortality rates during famines in Africa. Children on a Plumpy’nut regimen add pounds rapidly, often going from a near-death state to relative health in a month. In the world of humanitarian aid, where progress is usually measured in subtle increments of misery, the new product offers a rare satisfaction: swift, visible, fantastic efficacy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Plumpy-t.html

2010-09-02,Upper Cuts,"Whenever it feels like the sky is falling on men’s fashion, it’s warming to remember that one of Beau Brummell’s London tailors, Meyer & Mortimer, is still dressing the hyper-fastidious. This fun fact is one of hundreds in ‘‘Bespoke: The Men’s Style of Savile Row’’ (Rizzoli), a new tome as handsome as its subject. Up front, the author James Sherwood clears up any uncertainty fogging the much-abused term: To earn the label bespoke a garment must be measured, cut and sewn by hand; the pattern must also be hand-cut. When the pioneers of custom British tailoring took their first orders in the early 1800s, they were for clothes inspired by the ‘‘honest’’ wardrobe of the English country gentleman. In 1929 Hawkes & Co. did the unthinkable by introducing ‘‘immediate wear’’ to Savile Row, and by 1948, sales of the firm’s off-the-peg suits surpassed those of bespoke. It’s a trend that has never been reversed, though not for want of trying. In the ’90s, Richard Anderson, Ozwald Boateng and Richard James opened shops, forming what Sherwood tags ‘‘The New Establishment.’’ And Edward Sexton, Spencer Hart and Timothy Everest are currently powering a ‘‘Row Renaissance.’’ ‘‘Bespoke’’ is especially good on the crazy language peculiar to the Row. Who knew that a ‘‘tab’’ is a fussy customer, or a ‘‘crushed beetle’’ a badly made buttonhole?",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/upper-cuts/

I., who is in the action movie “Takers,” remains on probation after pleading guilty to federal weapons charges stemming from a 2007 sting operation in which he was caught receiving three machine guns and two silencers that had been bought for him. After his guilty plea T. I. appeared on an MTV reality series, “T. I.’s Road to Redemption,” in which he warned teenagers about the dangers of guns and violence.

Kaikai and Kiki, above, two weirdly cute (or is that cutely weird?) characters created by Takashi Murakami, right, the Japanese Pop artist, are being turned into larger-than-life balloons that will mix it up with the traditional cartoon stars and corporate trademarks for the parade’s 84th annual run on Nov. 25, its producers said on Thursday. The balloon likenesses of Mr. Murakami’s characters will be about 40 feet long when uninflated, and about three stories tall when filled with helium. Mr. Murakami is to be the fourth contemporary artist in recent years to have his work translated to the parade-balloon medium, after Tom Otterness (whose upside-down Humpty Dumpty made its Macy’s debut in 2005), Jeff Koons (whose inflatable bunny came next, in 2006) and Keith Haring (whose estate contributed to a figure-with-heart balloon in 2008). Asked in a telephone interview if Mr. Murakami’s characters might be a bit unsettling for younger viewers, Robin Hall, the parade’s executive producer said: “Fangs are very hot right now, if you’ve missed this trend. This is an excellent year for Murakami. And these balloons are adorable. They have a charm to them.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03arts-FROMMICKEYTO_BRF.html

Smuggled into Southern railroad depots by Pullman porters, dropped off by barnstorming black athletes and entertainers, The Defender emerged as both cheerleader and chronicler of an exodus that would lead about six million African-Americans to abandon the states of the Old Confederacy between 1915 and 1970. “If all of their dream does not come true,” it confidently predicted, “enough will come to pass to justify their actions.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html

When everyone tries to pay off debt at the same time, the result is contraction and deflation, which ends up making the debt problem worse even if nominal debt falls. On the other hand, a strong fiscal stimulus, by expanding the economy and creating moderate inflation, can actually help resolve debt problems.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/paradoxes-of-deleveraging-and-releveraging/

Henry Meadows is composing “this blotted memoir of my wartime days” in 1980 aboard a vast, surreal vessel he has helped construct: a sort of navigable iceberg complete with fitness center, library and cinema, not to mention a mosque for the Baluchi workers and the Saudi Arabian sheik who has commissioned the ship as a way of delivering fresh water to the desert.

Kaufman and Moss Hart about the loopy Sycamore family. The production was supposed to have a pre-Broadway run at the Huntington Theater Company in Boston this month, but that was canceled in the spring, a Huntington spokeswoman said, because Ms. McCann and her producing partners were not able to complete the deal with enough lead time for the theater. With the Huntington run off, Ms. McCann said in an interview, her director on the production, Anna D.

The same thing is happening now, I argued, with a new replicator.

2010-09-06,California Lawmakers Approve Stolen-Art Bill,"California lawmakers have given final approval to a bill that would extend the time in which people can sue museums to recover what they believe are stolen works of art. A spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he had not decided whether to sign the bill, which would give people six years to file a claim instead of the current three. The legislation, approved this week, grew out of cases in which time became a factor in litigation involving art looted by the Nazis. California once had a law that set no time limit on such claims, but it was struck down as unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this year. Without that law, courts have generally held that the statute of limitations governing stolen art begins when the claimant discovers the work’s whereabouts, or when they should have discovered it with reasonable diligence (because the work, for example, was posted on a museum’s Web site or featured in an exhibition). Under the new legislation, which governs claims against museums, galleries and auction houses, plaintiffs are freed from any reasonable-diligence provision and the clock does not start until plaintiffs have gathered enough information to evaluate whether they have valid claims. The California Association of Museums has described the bill as “unnecessary, unfair, unconstitutional and disruptive” of property rights.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/arts/design/04arts-CALIFORNIALA_BRF.html

Mr. Hogan was served with a departure prohibition order by the Australian Tax Office last month when he traveled to Sydney for his mother’s funeral.

A lawyer for Mr. Hogan said in a statement Friday that after a “cordial and cooperative” meeting with tax officials, an agreement had been reached. “While the commissioner and Mr. Hogan remain in dispute on more general taxation issues, Mr. Hogan continues to protest his innocence and denies any wrongdoing,” the statement said, according to The A.P.

In its citation, the festival praised him “as an innovator of the contemporary language of cinema,” but Mr. Woo said, “I wouldn’t say that I have much contributed to film society, even though I made several good films.” He said he hoped his future work would provide “a bridge between the good things of the West and the East, so we can further our mutual knowledge and build a strong friendship.” Following the historical “Red Cliff,” set in China’s feudal period, Mr. Woo’s latest film is “Reign of Assassins,” a martial-arts movie showing out of competition in Venice.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/movies/04arts-WOOGETSLIFET_BRF.html

The spokesman, Rick Miramontez, said that the musical’s creators wanted more time to overhaul the show’s book and that the director on board, David Cromer (“Our Town”), had several competing projects to schedule. Mr. Miramontez said fund-raising for the production, which is expected to cost about $5 million, had not been a problem. With music by Joseph Zellnik and book and lyrics by David Zellnik, who are brothers, “Yank!” revolves around two young soldiers whose friendship turns into romance during the war. The musical drew mostly good reviews during an Off Broadway run at York Theater Company in the winter, when it was one of several musicals and plays in New York that featured gay love stories. Mr. Miramontez said that Mr. Cromer and Bobby Steggert (above, a Tony nominee for “Ragtime”), who starred in the Off Broadway production, remain committed to a Broadway production of “Yank!” and that Mr. Cromer was working on the show virtually every day.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/theater/04arts-YANKWONTREAC_BRF.html

The vaccine, called rindopepimut, is “no longer a strategic priority of Pfizer,” which will return the rights to the therapy to Celldex on Nov. 1, Celldex said. The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing generally required to win regulatory approval. Pfizer licensed rights to the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have $450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in 2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. Celldex’s chief executive, Anthony Marucci, said the company would need to raise more money to pay for late-stage testing but would not need another partner. Shares of Celldex, based in Needham Mass., fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53. ",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/business/04bizbriefs-CELLDEXLOSES_BRF.html
2010-09-06,H&R Block Dismisses Concerns About Mortgages,"H&R Block told investors to ignore speculation that it faced a surge in costs tied to its defunct mortgage business. Concern about potential losses tied to buybacks of home loans “is not based on fact,” and reserves to protect the company against claims are adequate, the chief executive, Alan M. Bennett, said Thursday during a conference call about fiscal first-quarter earnings. The call included repeated queries about claims, which have totaled more than $680 million. H&R Block originated mortgages through January 2008, and some were sold to become part of mortgage-backed securities. The company’s mortgage buyback liability “remains within our reserved expectations, and we continue to view related reserves as adequate,” the chief financial officer, Jeffrey T. Brown, said. H&R Block reported a loss from continuing operations of $127.6 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ending July 10, compared with $130.6 million, or 39 cents, in the same period last year. Its net loss narrowed to $130.7 million from $133.6 million. Shares of H&R Block, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., rose 73 cents, or 6 percent, to $13.30.

Still, this is a team on the rise after finishing 8-8 last season, coupling a premier N.F.L. defense (fourth best in points allowed in 2009) with the hope that quarterback Alex Smith will make a big leap by playing the same offense for two consecutive years. Smith is surrounded by plenty of talent, including tight end Vernon Davis and the emerging receiver Michael Crabtree. Do not look for Smith to finally get to use the spread offense he prefers, though. Singletary wants to be an old-school, smash-mouth team — he defined that style as a player — and the Niners upgraded their offensive line in the draft to that end.

(The Packers were third in points scored last season.) The defense was seventh in points allowed, and although Al Harris and Charles Woodson are among the best cornerback tandems in the league, they are each at least 33 and injuries are taking a toll. Harris (knee) is on the physically unable to perform list and unavailable for at least six games.

The first-team offense struggled in the preseason; Mark Sanchez still makes too many mistakes, and the offensive line looked spotty.

The passing game, even without Jackson, is deep and explosive and figures only to get better now that teams have to pay attention to Ryan Mathews instead of LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the 31st-ranked rushing offense last season. Still, you get the feeling the window is about to close on this team. Several big names, like linebacker Shawne Merriman and returner Darren Sproles, are in their contract years, and the Chargers simply can’t keep racing through the regular season (they won their final 11 games in 2009 and have one of the easiest schedules this season) only to collapse in the playoffs. Last season’s lackluster playoff loss to the Jets might be pinned on Norv Turner’s insistence on giving the ball to Tomlinson, but the excuses, and the Chargers’ dominance, are running out.

Bill Polian, the Colts’ president, has surrounded Manning with superb talent, so much so that Indianapolis’s 2007 first-round draft pick, Anthony Gonzalez, could be the odd man out in a fabulous group of receivers. The offensive line has gotten much bigger with the hopes of establishing a ground game, but how much does that really matter? Manning threw 571 passes last year and was a coach’s decision from leading Indianapolis to a likely undefeated regular season. The defense, which allowed fewer than 20 points a game, should be better in Year 2 under Larry Coyer because Bob Sanders, a supremely gifted safety, is healthy again. The only problem the Colts face is that the expectations are so high, if they don’t win it all, the season will be a huge disappointment.

And on Friday and Saturday she performed a one-woman “Cinderella” at the Issue Project Room in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

He opened a program of the festival orchestra (he was supposed to have led all of it), conducting the first movement of Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings. Then, because he was experiencing sciatic problems that recurred as a byproduct of the surgery, he stepped aside to let a younger conductor, Tatsuya Shimono, take over. When Mr. Ozawa, right, took the stage, he was greeted as warmly as the politest of audiences could manage: no standing, no cheering, but loud, sustained applause. Half standing, half sitting, he delivered brief remarks from the stage, explaining his difficulties, apologizing for being unable to do more and promising to be back next year. Then he conducted the movement, mostly standing and with typically vigorous gestures. The orchestra, obviously charged up for the occasion, delivered a searingly intense performance. Rhythmic clapping broke out after the concert, directed at Mr. Ozawa in the audience, and he half ran to greet Mr. Shimono and the players onstage.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/arts/music/06arts-SEIJIOZAWAGR_BRF.html

Mr. Blair was separated from the crowd by a security barrier and was not harmed. Four people were arrested and charged with public offenses, the police told Agence France-Presse. Several hundred others lined up at a back door of the bookshop to await their turn to meet Mr. Blair and have their copies signed.

In numerous posts published across just a few hours, Mr. West recounted some of the abuse he had taken from the public. “People tweeted that they wish I was dead,” he wrote. “No listen. They wanted me to die people. I carry that. I smile and take pictures through that.” Mr. West also defended his actions: “Who’s seen the play Wicked? I’ve seen it 4 times! Other than loving the music acting and costumes ... it’s my story!!! The Wicked witch of the west basically is so convicted to tell her truth when she does it she is outcasted by society and turned WICKED.” And he criticized members of the news media for “demonizing” him. But in the end, Mr. West wrote, “I take the responsibility for my actions,” and he offered Ms. Swift this message: “I wrote a song for Taylor Swift that’s so beautiful and I want her to have it. If she won’t take it then I’ll perform it for her.” After taking a break from the public for much of the past year, Mr. West has begun returning to the spotlight, announcing plans for a new album this fall and accepting MTV’s invitation to perform at this year’s awards show on Sept. 12.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/arts/music/06arts-KANYEWESTTRI_BRF.html

For Yurman, the ’50s were the golden era of American design, and not just in the automobile industry. ‘‘I tip my hat to it and hope I can only add to this legacy.’’ When it comes to cars, however, it’s ultimately what’s under the hood that gets him revved up: he loves the ’57 T-Bird for its beauty more than its brawn. ‘‘It is a cruiser, a cream puff,’’ says Yurman, who instead owns a ’66 Bel Air and a ’69 Ford Mustang. ‘‘I go for the one where some guy in the factory said, ‘Let’s make this car as fast as we can.’ ’’ ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/timeless-days-of-thunder/

2010-09-07,High Hopes For Poussin Sale at Christie’s,"Christie’s in London is expecting a big sale of a painting by the French master Nicolas Poussin at a December auction. Christie’s said it was expecting the painting, “Ordination,” above, one of a set of seven 17th-century works by Poussin depicting the sacraments, to sell for between $23 million and $31 million at the old masters and 19th-century Art auction on Dec. 7, Reuters reported. That high estimate was based on last year’s old masters sale, when a drawing by Raphael sold for $47.9 million and a painting by Rembrandt went for $33.2 million. The seven paintings in the Poussin series were sold to the Belvoir estate of the Dukes of Rutland in the late 18th century. Of those works “Penance” was destroyed by a fire, and “Baptism” was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1946. The five remaining  “Ordination,” “Confirmation,” “Eucharist,” “Extreme Unction” and “Marriage”  have been on loan to the National Gallery in London since 2003. In a statement the estate said the sale proceeds would go to the restoration and long-term preservation of Belvoir Castle and Estate.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/arts/design/07arts-HIGHHOPESFOR_BRF.html
2010-09-07,James Cameron Plans Protest Film In 3-D,"The director James Cameron has announced plans to make another 3-D film about an indigenous tribe trying to preserve its land. Unlike his Oscar-winning “Avatar,” however, this film will be a documentary about the Xikrin-Kayapó tribe in Brazil and its attempts to stop the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, which is to be built near tribal lands on the Xingu River, a tributary of the Amazon, Agence France-Presse reported. Construction of the dam, which is to be the world’s third largest, will require the flooding of 200 square miles of the Xingu River basin. Opposition groups say the flooding will displace about 12,000 people and destroy the fishing industry, but the Brazilian government maintains that the lands will not be harmed and that it is taking environmental issues into consideration. In an interview Sunday in the newspaper Folha de São Paulo, Mr. Cameron said that when the Xikrin-Kayapó leaders asked for his help, he “could not turn away.” “I want to take a 3-D camera to film how they live, their culture,” he added. Mr. Cameron has made previous trips to Brazil to show his support and has already made a short film about the issue, which will be included on the forthcoming “Avatar” special-edition DVD. Work on the dam is scheduled to begin late this year or in early 2011.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/movies/07arts-JAMESCAMERON_BRF.html

2010-09-08,Phys Ed: How to Fix a Bad Tennis Shoulder,"For a study published a few years ago in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers at the High Performance National Training Center in Argentina X-rayed the shoulders of 18 elite older tennis players, both men and women. Each of the 18, between the ages of 51 and 75, had at one time played professionally, and all were still active in tennis, as either  competitors or teachers. None had experienced any unusual shoulder pain or problems. But when radiologists reviewed the players’ X-rays, they found signs of osteoarthritis, or loss of joint cartilage, in a third of the players’ dominant shoulders (generally the right). Shoulder X-rays from an age-matched group of Argentines who didn’t play tennis turned up arthritic changes in only 11 percent of the group. With understandable circumspection, the authors, operating under the auspices of the Argentine Tennis Association, concluded that years of “intensive tennis practice may be a predisposing factor for the development of mild degenerative articular changes in the dominant shoulder.” Playing tennis, in other words, might be gnawing away at the joint.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/phys-ed-how-to-fix-a-bad-tennis-shoulder/

2010-09-08,Rooms With a View,"The novel of braided, alternating stories, perfected by David Mitchell, is a narrative daisy chain designed to tease readers by a process akin to ­coitus interruptus. One story stops, another begins, then a third, then more, then it’s back to the first and so on. Novels like this suggest hidden connections between disparate sets of characters, although the spectacle of sheer juxtaposition — of incongruous stories slyly interpolated — is also part of their appeal. Sometimes major characters in one story become secondary characters in others. Or unexpected events ripple through the separate sections, providing an accidental link. To give their narrative centrifuge a provisional stability, novelists sometimes employ a framing device. Why not, for example, set one’s alternating stories in — of course! — a hotel? In this manner, a technique as old-fashioned as the 1932 film “Grand Hotel” merges with the postmodernism of Mitchell’s “Cloud Atlas.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Vernon-t.html

2010-09-08,Seoul-Searching With Tory Burch,"When Tory Burch was last in Europe, she came armed with a voice recorder, which she used to capture her observations. The designer then traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to open her new boutique in Cheongdam-dong. (It’s like the South Korean Rodeo Drive.) Once there, she handed off the voice recorder to the filmmaker Van Neistat (of viral video fame), who gave himself the unusual task of pairing Burch’s commentary on her European jaunt — about cypress trees in Tuscany, a sunset over the Seine — with scenes from Seoul. The seemingly awkward conceit comes off cleverly, but it did leave us wondering what Burch thought of Seoul itself. “The city is very international and progressive,” she says. “I loved everything from the chic women to the interesting architecture. Walking into the Leeum museum was so exciting — there were three spider sculptures by one of my favorite artists, Louise Bourgeois. The stores are also fantastic, like Boon, Mue and 10 Corso Como. I definitely want to go back. There is so much more I’d love to see.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/seoul-searching-with-tory-burch/
2010-09-08,A Life in Nepal,"Samrat Upadhyay’s fiction has tended to be small in scale, charting the infinitesimal tremors of middle-class angst. That his characters happen to live in Katmandu instead of, say, Bloomington, Ind. — where Upadhyay, who was born and raised in Nepal, now makes his home — is at times almost incidental. “Those Led Zeppelin days are over, friend,” a Nepali wife chides her husband in “Buddha’s Orphans,” Upadhyay’s new novel. “You need to get a job so we can start thinking about a child.” The fretting, the obsessive nostalgia, the muffled ache: it’s all distressingly familiar.

The two men’s lives have been entwined almost beyond imagining, and one cannot survive without the other. Eng clings to his dead twin, then dies himself.

That overeager Catholic schoolgirl and aspiring entertainer may remain in semiretirement, but Molly Shannon, the “Saturday Night Live” alumna who portrayed her (along with characters like Sally O’Malley and a parody version of Ann Miller) on that program, is slated to make her Broadway debut in “Promises, Promises,” the musical’s publicists said on Wednesday. Ms. Shannon will take over the role of the barfly Marge MacDougall from Katie Finneran on Oct. 12; Ms. Finneran, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of that character this year (and who is pregnant with her first child), will leave the production after Oct. 10.

2010-09-08,Networking,"When I first heard that the Department of Homeland Security had brought in a group of science fiction writers to brainstorm new ways that terrorists might attack America, something changed for me forever. I realized this was one of the first news stories I had ever totally believed — in part because it was like something from fiction. Even if it hadn’t happened yet, it could happen, and therefore probably would. In a late-capitalist marketplace where you can buy or sell almost anything, including artificial islands in Dubai (Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt apparently bought one in the shape of Ethiopia), nothing feels impossible. And in a world where fiction is becoming indistinguishable from reality, as the philosopher Baudrillard suggested, the flow of “truth” goes both ways. It’s just as likely that fiction will come true as it is that the truth will turn out to have been fiction all along.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Thomas-t.html

For voyagers across the Indian Ocean its safe harbor was a refuge after a long journey. The vast Chinese trading fleet led by the eunuch Zheng He moored at Zanzibar in the early 15th century to exchange its silver for African gold. For Vasco da Gama, who landed there in 1499, beginning 200 years of Portuguese domination, it was an island of repose for men slaughtering their way across the Eastern seas.

Buffalo, N.Y., alone had maybe 15 family-owned men’s-wear shops selling what a certain three-hankie film would universally popularize as the preppy look.

Serge’s father, a manic tinkerer with early wireless technology, runs a school for the deaf but seems oblivious to his own deaf wife, Serge’s mother, who’s so blinkered on opium (supplied by a mute gardener who grows the poppies himself) that she nearly lets Serge drown in a creek at age 2. Serge’s beloved older sister, Sophie, becomes sexually involved with a friend of their father’s and winds up committing suicide at 17 — possibly after having an abortion. Serge’s relationship to Sophie is preternaturally close, with incestuous overtones, and her death severs his only real human connection. But these dramas are merely suggested, their shadowy outlines ignored, sublimated or flat-out denied by those involved; Sophie’s self-poisoning is deemed an accident.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Egan-t.html

2010-09-09,War Games," Unless you regard something like “Iron Man” as a film about Afghanistan, the movies inspired by America’s contemporary wars have consistently been box-office flops. Even “The Hurt Locker” grossed only $16 million in theaters. Video games that evoke our current conflicts, on the other hand, are blockbusters — during the past three years, they have become the most popular fictional depictions of America’s current wars. Last year’s best-selling game was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which opens in Afghanistan; it was a sequel to a multimillion-selling 2007 game that features an American invasion of a nameless Middle Eastern country. Modern Warfare 2 has made “Avatar”-like profits for its studio, Activision. On the day the game was published in November, it sold nearly five million copies in North America and Britain, racking up $310 million in sales in 24 hours. By January of this year, the game’s worldwide sales added up to $1 billion. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/magazine/12military-t.html

By 2050, the population could reach 24 million, according to the projection, by Jennifer Van Hook, a professor of demography at Pennsylvania State University. Proponents of the repeal have argued that it would reduce the number of illegal immigrants by discouraging them from coming to this country to give birth.

2010-09-09,Thursday’s Matchup: Vikings at Saints,"“The Favre Indecision” may sound like a Robert Ludlum novel, but it’s really the story of the Vikings’ off-season. Brett Favre is back in the Vikings huddle, but the Vikings have major questions that go beyond Favre’s gimpy ankle. Their receiving corps is thin in the wake of Sidney Rice’s injury, their big-name offensive line looked like a colander during the preseason, and the star running back Adrian Peterson is coming off a three-fumble performance in the Vikings’ 31-28 loss to the Saints in the N.F.C. title game. Despite his age and eroded approval rating, Favre retains the power to relegate the defending champions to the second paragraph.The Saints are as unassuming as Super Bowl winners get. Minor scandals nip at their heels (Reggie Bush’s Heisman trophy is being melted by the N.C.A.A. and recast as a Yoke of Shame), but the most succulent story to stick to the team has been Sean Payton’s affinity for fruit-flavored gum. “Get me Juicy Fruit – not (bleeping) Spearmint,” Payton yelled at the assistant Adam Bailey at the Super Bowl; you can picture Payton later channeling Joan Crawford in “Mommie Dearest” and bludgeoning Bailey with a carton of Dentine.",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/thursdays-matchup-vikings-at-saints/

The interiors, which range from luxurious — like Eva Chow’s gold-leafed Los Angeles living room or Tory Burch’s opulent, surprisingly conservative Manhattan apartment — to industrial-funky, like Rachel Comey’s Long Island weekend house, may seem glamorous to those of us on the outside looking in. But as Suqi points out, even fashion designers “are not immune to the pitfalls of decorating or renovating.

Unfortunately for my children, who’d probably be just as happy to stay home, that reason is what keeps me slogging through the less glamorous parts of motherhood. When you travel you get the chance to prove to your children that life is at least as interesting as their bedtime stories. And if you can get them to believe that, then you can believe it too, at least for the duration of the trip.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/travel/12Journeys.html

It is no longer unusual for Sotheby’s and Christie’s to take over entire galleries. Sotheby’s did it in 1996, when it bought the André Emmerich Gallery. Christie’s followed, taking over Hall & Knight in 2004 and then Haunch of Venison three years ago. Like dealers, both companies also do much business selling works of art for clients privately. Now Sotheby’s is encroaching on dealer territory yet again but in a slightly different way.

His interpretations of the piano repertory — the work of Bach in particular — were fresh and provocative, and his self-presentation was both matinee-idol charismatic and winningly odd. As Gould’s celebrity grew, some of his peculiarities became as famous as his playing.

Fox Searchlight announced that it had acquired “The Tree of Life,” the latest film by Mr. Malick, an auteur unencumbered by conventional measurements of time and who took a 20-year hiatus between his features “Days of Heaven” (in 1978) and “The Thin Red Line” (in 1998). Fox Searchlight described “The Tree of Life” as a chronicle of a Midwestern family in the 1950s and a son (who is played as an adult by Sean Penn) who is trying to resolve his relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Though the movie has been rumored as a possible entrant in several 2010 film festivals and even a late-breaking qualifier this year for the Academy Awards, Fox Searchlight said it would release “The Tree of Life” in 2011. It will be Mr. Malick’s first feature since his (relatively recent) film about Capt.

The accessories, which will make their debut this weekend on the Ohne Titel runway, were the result of much experimentation — with shapes, geometry, problem solving and visual equations, even a science lab. “Our creative processes are similar and both very technical,” Gill says. “It made sense since our work shares a sleekness combined with underlying hand-wrought elements.” Contorting acrylic tubing around colorful enamel chords, Auerbach created a spiraling sculpture-like necklace and chose polished lucite and elastic bracelets. “I wanted to use a lot of clear material so that I could make big pieces that wouldn’t be too dominating,” she says. “I thought it would be interesting to see the clothes through the jewelry, and to make certain parts of the pieces like the elastic on the bracelets appear suspended in the air around the models’ wrists. I chose Lucite because it was durable and I could form it myself.” Our hypothesis?

2010-09-13,Runway Grooming | Duckie Brown,"At Duckie Brown’s runway show yesterday, American Crew, the men’s grooming brand, unveiled Curl and Boost, a new collection of specialized styling aids developed specifically for thinning and curly hair. Paul Wilson, the company’s artistic director, created two distinct looks to demonstrate the line’s versatility. While manipulating a model’s thick, curly locks, Wilson said that the first style, which was sleekly molded and sculpted close to the head, showed off “shorter, groomed, tamed and really shiny hair.” To sharply contrast that look, he created a second style that sported “full, lived in, dry-textured hair.” A tandem exercise in style extremes, the models’ hair complemented Duckie Brown’s spring fashions, which ranged from tailored trousers in muted tones to eye-popping bug print shirts. The Curl and Boost system, which is comprised of Curl Control (tames rough, unruly hair), Curl Construct (defines and shapes curls), Boost Powder (mattifies and builds texture), and Boost Cream (lifts thin hair to new heights), sell for $17.95 each and will be available at authorized American Crew salons beginning in January 2011.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/11/runway-grooming-duckie-brown/

The oversize book, with 435 hand-colored prints, was first bought by an early paleobotanist, Henry Witham.

2010-09-13,"The Daley Legacy, Inescapable","Trying to sum up the legacy of Mayor Richard M. Daley’s more than two decades in office in one neat snapshot is impossible. Mr. Daley is as complicated as the city he oversees. He is quick to anger, surprising, emotional; exceedingly loyal to some and ruthlessly business-like to others; parochial, yet overly sensitive when criticized for it. While he was in office, great strides were made. Mr. Daley oversaw a city that transformed its economy, making Chicago the vibrant hub of the Midwest. He remade the city’s front yard with Millennium Park, and showcased the city with a victory celebration after helping a Chicagoan win the highest office in the land. And he was ready to show it off on a global stage with an ambitious bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. But there were also stunning setbacks. Moves like the middle-of-the-night takeover of Meigs Field solidified a reputation as a bully and autocrat. There was the humiliating Olympics loss  elimination in the first round of the International Olympic Committee’s voting process  and the privatization missteps. Recent high-profile crime in otherwise-stable neighborhoods undermined the good news of relatively lower crime rates. And now he leaves a financial mess for his successor. Most assuredly, Mr. Daley’s success as mayor will be debated for years. What follows is a look at his legacy in five areas  politics, education, crime, race and business  that will most likely frame Chicagoans’ discussions about the eventful mayoralty of Richard M. Daley. JIM KIRK",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/12cncweblegacy.html

2010-09-13,Runway Beauty | Alexander Wang,"It seems like Alexander Wang took in a showing of the Tamra Davis documentary, “Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child,” which premiered this summer—backstage at his spring 2011 collection, the late artist was the most cited reference by makeup artist Diane Kendal, hairstylist Guido Palau, and Nonie Creme, co-founder of nail polish brand Butter London. Wang’s downtown gallerina was clad in sheer fabrics, optic white denim and wide-cut pants, paired with a no-look look that had beauty editors scratching their heads. “There isn’t really much makeup today,” said Kendal with a wry grin. She bleached brows by applying Wella Wellite Powder Lightener with a makeup brush “to keep the girls looking cool”—with the exception of Agyness Deyn, who apparently wasn’t up for a color change. And on the rest of the face? “Just concealer where needed and moisturizer. We wanted the skin to look shiny.” Over at the hair station, Palau said he “didn’t want hair color to stand out” and get in the way of the identity of Wang’s “new-age traveler woman.” To make the look uniform, he mixed Fuller’s Earth Clay–a cosmetic clay often used in DIY skincare recipes and that is also the main ingredient in popular 1940’s hair powder Minipoo—with white pigment and slicked the concoction through the hair. The resulting look was futuristic on models (including runway vets Karen Elson, Omahrya Mota and Karolina Kurkova), but in reality would look like someone in the middle of undergoing a double process (perhaps to emerge as the grey-haired woman seen earlier today at Cynthia Rowley). The nails, filed to a rounded shape, also appeared peculiarly half-done: manicurists applied one coat of Butter London Nail Foundation Flawless Basecoat followed by two coats of the brand’s Matte Finish Topcoat. The overall effect was certainly a look, and indeed, one best pulled off by a young art star, down to the late-breaking addition of faux rose gold septum rings.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/runway-beauty-alexander-wang/

But how much of the Céline designer Phoebe Philo’s tailored conceptualism, her hand with stripped-back superhot sportswear, would find its way into American clothes remained to be seen. We — fashion editors — all remember the Marni-fication of the industry a decade ago. We know very well what one cool brand can do to women’s closets.

It began to feel Pollyanna-like to tell them, “Those are not nice words,” or even, “We don’t curse,” and my message instead became, “We don’t curse in certain situations.” Like in front of your teachers. Or your grandmother (even though I now know she knows those words). Or at a job interview. And, as one who uses words for a living, I tried to stress that curses are lazy.

2010-09-14,Britain: Smuggling Accusations Prompt Investigation," Accusations that British soldiers in Afghanistan have used military aircraft flying back to Britain to smuggle heroin have led to an investigation and tighter security measures, Defense Ministry officials said. The accusations are said by the BBC to have originated with Afghans working for the British military. The extra procedures include the increased use of drug-sniffing dogs at the principal airfields used by aircraft that carry troops, equipment and casualties to Britain from Afghanistan, the officials said. “We are aware of these allegations,” a Defense Ministry spokeswoman said. “Although they are unsubstantiated, we take any such reports very seriously.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/world/europe/14briefs-BRITAIN.html

2010-09-14,More High School Students Than Ever Took the SAT Last Spring,"The number of graduating high school students who took the SAT climbed to 1.55 million last spring, a record figure that represents an increase of 1.2 percent, or nearly 18,000, over 2009, the College Board said Monday. The board, the nonprofit organization that oversees the college entrance exam, emphasized the impact of a rigorous high school curriculum on student performance. It said students who took four years of English and three or more years of math and science scored, on average, 151 points above those who did not. (A perfect score on the three-part exam is 2400.) But the National Center for Fair & Open Testing, a critic of the SAT, noted a decline in overall scores since 2006, when the federal No Child Left Behind testing mandates went into effect. When those figures are aggregated by race or ethnicity, the average scores of Asian-Americans climbed 36 points over that period, according to the Fair Test analysis, while those of black and Puerto Rican students fell 14 points, and those of white students decreased by 2 points.

The sleeve will keep a seal in place, preventing further leakage of oil and gas, if pressure inside the well increases during the final plugging operation. No appreciable amount of oil or gas has leaked for nearly two months. Company officials have said it will take about four days for the relief well to intercept the stricken well. After that, the final plugging operation, which will involve pumping mud and cement into the stricken well, should take about a week.

Many mental-health experts do not properly understand or acknowledge the key role nutrition plays in brain functioning, especially regarding the developing brains of children. Until we realize that it is impossible for a brain to function properly when it is starved of essential nutrients largely absent from our Western, packaged diets, our mental-health treatments will remain incomplete.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/magazine/19Letters-t-CANPRESCHOOL_LETTERS.html

2010-09-14,Stijl Standing,"In 1927, Mies van der Rohe designed the innovative concrete-and-steel Weissenhof apartments in Stuttgart, Germany, which would become a landmark of International-style architecture; that same year, Gerrit Rietveld built the so-called chauffeur’s house (above), a little-known but remarkably similar building in his hometown of Utrecht, the Netherlands, which leaked and had to be redone shortly thereafter. Trained as a cabinetmaker, Rietveld — an early member of the de Stijl movement known for his Red-Blue Chair and Schröder House — suffered many such disappointments in a career of more than 45 years. But a new retrospective at Utrecht’s Centraal Museum illustrates how his groundbreaking ideas had a much broader impact than is generally acknowledged. ‘‘In Holland you have this feeling that maybe he was a genius but he wasn’t a good architect,’’ says Ida van Zijl, the curator of ‘‘Rietveld’s Universe,’’ which opens Oct. 20 as part of the Netherlands’ Rietveld Year. ‘‘People don’t realize how many works he made and how experimental they were.’’ The exhibition puts his furniture and architecture on an international scale, comparing it with Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier and van der Rohe as well as showing its influence on contemporary designers. In a room dedicated to the Red-Blue Chair, the real thing will sit alongside a video of Maarten Baas’s charred homage. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/stijl-standing/

2010-09-14,Runway Beauty | Marc Jacobs,"The Studio 54 style of Anjelica Huston, Pat Cleveland and Jerry Hall inspired Marc Jacobs this season. The designer’s beauty dream team — François Nars, Redken’s Guido Palau and Elisa Ferri for Creative Nail Design — didn’t disappoint. (Not that they could have: Arnold mentioned there was a six-hour beauty test the night before.) “We kept a few of the iconic things from the ’70s, like no eyebrows — we’re bleaching all the brows,” Nars said backstage. “Then a dark, reddish-brownish matte lipstick, a little bit of shiny, peachy color on the cheeks to give them a healthy look and deep forest green on the eyes with Vaseline on top.” A spring shade from Creative Nail called Perfectly Bare blended with mattifying top coat was applied to nails to “blank them out,” according to Arnold, mimicking the treatment of the brows. Toes, however, were painted a dark red. “Marc wanted deep, dark, shiny berry toes,” Arnold said. “When he saw Bloodline, he was like, ‘That’s it!’” Models were given one of four side-parted, texturized hairstyles ranging from Marcel waves to major Biba-esque frizz, depending on their natural hair type. “Marc hates hair extensions,” Palau said. “We wanted to capture that period, the decadent loucheness of the ’70s supermodels. You know, that kind of woman who reeks of perfume.” Ah, but would it be Daisy, Lola or even Bang?",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/runway-beauty-marc-jacobs/

And to coincide with this month’s survey exhibition at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, ‘‘From Here to There: Alec Soth’s America’’ (above; Walker Art Center; $60) is an anthology of past and new work that takes us through the country’s sad and dreamy subcultures, including ‘‘Broken Manual,’’ portraits of men who live off the grid. ‘‘I’ve had the opportunity to photograph all over the world,’’ Soth says, ‘‘but I keep coming back to America.

2010-09-15,Cirque Du Soleil Plans To Play Radio City,"To the extent that whimsical Canadian clowns can be described as sober people, a chastened Cirque du Soleil disclosed the details on Tuesday of a new show it plans to bring to Radio City Music Hall next summer. The announcement follows the commercial failure of another Cirque show (“Banana Shpeel”) this year at the Beacon Theater, which was supposed to be the Montreal-based company’s beachhead in a wider expansion into New York. The Radio City show, which does not yet have a title, will be a $50 million production that returns to the time-tested Cirque brand of acrobatic spectacle, like “Wintuk,” above. It will employ a cast of more than 70 and be directed by the filmmaker François Girard (“Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould”; “Silk”). The creators hope the show will run for at least four months, starting in June, and return annually for four years. “There is only one way to succeed in New York, by becoming a citizen of New York City,” Daniel Lamarre, the chief executive of Cirque du Soleil, said in a telephone interview. “We have to earn our citizenship.” Cirque described the show as taking place in an abandoned theater where a magician “has lost his love and with her, his magic has disappeared.” Seeking her return, the magician “is plunged into a world inhabited by surreal creatures.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/theater/15arts-CIRQUEDUSOLE_BRF.html

The exhibition, “Saving Grace: A Celebration of Haitian Art,” is being organized by a historian of Haitian art, Gérald Alexis, and will feature works from the Nader Gallery in Port-au-Prince, as well as others being lent by artists and private collectors in Haiti, Canada and the United States. Many of the best-known artists of the Haitian Renaissance, including Hector Hyppolite, Célestin Faustin, Wilson Bigaud and Préfète Duffaut, will be represented. The Nader Gallery survived the earthquake that devastated Haiti in January, but a private museum owned by the same family, and which housed some 12,000 works of art, was destroyed. Two paintings included in the exhibition, Hyppolite’s “Pot de Fleurs” and Faustin’s “Beau Rêve,” were pulled from the wreckage and restored by art conservators working in a lab set up in Port-au-Prince by the Smithsonian Institution.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/arts/design/15arts-EXHIBITIONOF_BRF.html

2010-09-15,Regents to End Injunction on Museum Art Sales,"In a surprise development in the battle over whether museums should be allowed to sell art to cover operating costs, the New York State Board of Regents on Tuesday approved the expiration of emergency regulations regarding such “deaccessioning” on Oct. 8. Those rules, which enjoined such sales, have been in effect since 2008. After hearing views from museums statewide, “there was no consensus on the efficacy of those emergency regulations,” David Steiner, the state’s education commissioner, said in a statement. Thus, “those regulations will be allowed to expire, allowing the prior regulations regarding museum collections to once again take effect.” Last month the board indicated it planned to make the emergency regulations permanent, in part because a bill addressing the issue had stalled in the Legislature. “This removes a substantial obstacle to the monetization of art held in the public trust and to the transfer of art from public hands to private hands,” said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who led the drafting of the bill.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/arts/15arts-REGENTSTOEND_BRF.html

The traditionally Portuguese district of Victorian row houses north of Notting Hill is home to buzzy gastropubs and incognito celebrities — Sophie Dahl and Jade Jagger live here — and the rents are still cheap enough that pioneering shop owners are hanging out shingles on Chamberlayne Road. Victoria Brotherson, the florist behind Scarlet and Violet (76 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-969-9446), sells vintage cut-crystal vases and chipped enamel pitchers alongside English blooms like cornflower and nigella. ‘‘I thought I was just going to have a little workshop,’’ she says. ‘‘I was taken by surprise that we were that busy.’’ In her wake, two vintage furniture stores, Howie & Belle (52 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-964-4553) and Circus Antiques (60 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-968-8244), have opened among the bookies’ offices down the street. And a 10-minute walk away in Kensal Green, Retrouvius (2A Ravensworth Road; 011-44-208-960-6060)is the brainchild of the designers Adam Hills and Maria Speake, a space stocked with repurposed architectural salvage. There’s quirky drinking and dining, too: besides the Chamberlayne Pub and Steakhouse (83 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-960-4311) and the wine bar Miro’s (75 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-203-235-0003), the gastropub Paradise by Way of Kensal Green (19 Kilburn Lane; 011-44-208-969-0098) serves seasonal and organic dishes and a beloved sticky toffee pudding.

Beginning with Pat Toomey and continuing through Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, Sharron Angle and Joe Miller, the candidates propelled to victory by Tea Partier enthusiasm have often given the national Republican Party heartburn, but none of them have been clearly un-electable — and if this fall is as good to the G.O.P. as it’s shaping up to be right now, most of them will probably end up winning. Whereas in those races where the “rightwardmost candidate” (to borrow William F. Buckley’s phrase) couldn’t possibly win a general election, the Tea Party hasn’t gone all in: Thus Carly Fiorina rather than Chuck DeVore is the Republican nominee for the California Senate, John McCain rather than J.D.

Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus have been co-directing since the mid-’70s. Next year, their work will be the subject of a retrospective at the Museum of the Moving Image. Their latest production, “The Kings of Pastry,” makes its theatrical debut at Film Forum. Bon appétit. The movie takes viewers to Lyon, France, to follow the  Alsatian pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, the co-founder of Chicago’s French Pastry School, as he vies for France’s most prestigious trade award, the M.O.F. (Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, or Best Craftsmen of France). Held every four years, the grueling competition is the artisanal equivalent of the Olympics — or rather, it makes “Top Chef” look like a slumber party. “In a way,” Hegedus says, “television cooking shows have spoiled us for the possibilities of true drama in the kitchen.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/asked-answered-d-a-pennebaker-and-chris-hegedus/

2010-09-16,Seeing Things | Studio Visit: Pae White,"I recently visited the artist Pae White in her Los Angeles studio, where she was busy working on a new exhibition for the Power Plant in Toronto. The exhibition, which opens on Oct. 9, will feature a number of her recent tapestry works as well as a new commissioned tapestry called “Sea Beast.” White has called the show “Material Mutters” because, she explained, “it’s about the exploration of process and the material is doing the talking.” Smoke has been a recurring motif in her work lately, and she has been exploring ways to capture its elusive qualities in various media, including a series of carved paper works that she was finishing for the Toronto show. Because smoke moves so rapidly and changes form so quickly, White likes the way the image of something so immaterial contrasts with the physicality of fabric. “It’s one material trying to understand another and it turns the fabric into something other than itself,” she said. At the Whitney Museum’s Biennial this spring, her monumental digitally woven tapestry “Still, Untitled” was a showstopper.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/seeing-things-studio-visit-pae-white/

2010-09-17,City Opera Chairwoman To Resign,"Susan L. Baker, a former Goldman Sachs executive who oversaw the ill-fated and short-lived hiring of Gerard Mortier as general manager of the New York City Opera, is stepping down as the company’s chairwoman, City Opera said Thursday. Her place will be taken on Dec. 16 by Charles R. Wall, a former tobacco company lawyer who served on the board from 2001 to 2008. In a brief statement that came with the announcement Ms. Baker gave no reason. A City Opera spokesman said Ms. Baker was not immediately available to comment. Ms. Baker, who has held the job for seven years, will remain on the board. She championed the hiring of Mr. Mortier, an iconoclastic Belgian opera impresario who also served as artistic director, after meeting him at a dinner. He joined the company in February 2007 but worked out an agreement under which he would continue to serve in his previous job of running the Paris National Opera. Mr. Mortier pushed for the renovation of City Opera’s Lincoln Center home, now the David H. Koch Theater, which was closed for the 2008-9 season. The closing contributed to a financial nightmare for the company, which only last season began a modest comeback.

The show, directed by Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for the original 1957 production, opened in March 2009 to mostly positive reviews. Though it recouped its $14 million investment, the production has struggled in recent months at the box office. Following “West Side Story” at the Palace Theater will be the new musical “Priscilla Queen of the Desert,” based on the 1994 movie about three Australian drag queens.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/theater/17arts-WESTSIDESTOR_BRF.html

2010-09-17,Sondheim And Company Christen Sondheim Theater,"“I’m deeply embarrassed,” Stephen Sondheim said Wednesday evening at a ceremony to officially light the marquee of the Broadway theater renamed in his honor (above). “Thrilled, but deeply embarrassed.” Mr. Sondheim, 80, the composer and lyricist of musicals including “A Little Night Music,” “Into the Woods,” “Company” and “Sweeney Todd,” was joined outside the soon-to-be-former Henry Miller’s Theater on West 43rd Street by his fellow Broadway luminaries Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane and John Weidman, as well as the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and executives from the Roundabout Theater Company, which operates the theater. Addressing a crowd of Broadway industry veterans and fans of his work, Mr. Sondheim explained the source of his embarrassment. “Partly because I’ve always hated my last name,” he said. “It just doesn’t sing.” After his speech Mr. Sondheim pulled a switch at the front of the stage, and an illuminated version of his signature flickered and came to life (without a still-missing dot in the letter i that has apparently gone into one of Mrs. Lovett’s pies).",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/theater/17arts-SONDHEIMANDC_BRF.html

2010-09-17,The Beast Eyes Broadway,"We don’t remember things working out so well when they tried to fit King Kong onto a New York stage in that classic 1933 film. But circumstances might turn out better for Global Creatures, the Australian production company behind animatronic touring shows like “Walking With Dinosaurs.” It is aiming to bring a “King Kong” musical to Broadway as soon as 2013. Carmen Pavlovic, the chief executive of Global Creatures, said the project, which has been authorized by the estate of the “King Kong” co-director Merian C. Cooper, and whose creative team will include the director Daniel Kramer, the book writer Craig Lucas (“Prelude to a Kiss”) and the composer Marius de Vries (Baz Luhrmann’s “William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet”), will feature a robotic Kong (above) that can fit in the notoriously narrow wings of a Broadway theater. At heart the show will be a musical. “King Kong doesn’t suddenly grab a microphone and sing a song to Ann Darrow, I promise you,” Ms. Pavlovic said. “But if you think about the story and the character of Ann, and her background as a performer, and sailors on a ship, and Ann’s relationship with Kong, there’s plenty of opportunities within the story itself, where music naturally fits.”",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/theater/17arts-THEBEASTEYES_BRF.html
2010-09-17,Michael Jackson’s Mother Sues Promoter Over His Death,"Michael Jackson’s mother has filed a lawsuit against the promoter of his planned concerts last year, saying that the company, AEG Live, failed to supply medical equipment or to monitor his personal doctor properly, Reuters reported. In her suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday, Katherine Jackson seeks unspecified damages and says that the promoter is responsible for the “actions and inactions” of the doctor, Conrad Murray, and that it put “its desire for massive profits” over Jackson’s health. “AEG’s representations to Jackson were false,” the suit says, “because in reality AEG was merely doing whatever it took to make sure that Michael Jackson could make it to rehearsals and shows, and AEG did not provide a doctor who was truly looking out for Jackson’s well-being.” A lawyer for AEG, Marvin S. Putnam, said in a statement that the lawsuit “is inaccurate, unsubstantiated and meritless.” On June 25, 2009, three weeks before he was to begin a series of 50 comeback shows in London, Jackson died from an overdose of powerful sedatives, and the Los Angeles medical examiner has ruled his death a homicide. Dr. Murray, who was not named in Katherine Jackson’s suit, has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in the death.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/music/17arts-MICHAELJACKS_BRF.html
2010-09-17,Winfrey And Franzen Reconcile,"It appears that Oprah Winfrey and Jonathan Franzen have kissed and made up. Nearly a decade after their public literary feud, Ms. Winfrey has selected “Freedom,” Mr. Franzen’s new best-selling novel, as her next book-club pick, according to booksellers who have seen early copies of the book. The selection is expected to be announced on Friday’s “Oprah” broadcast. In 2001 Mr. Franzen offended Ms. Winfrey when he suggested in interviews that some of her book club picks were middlebrow, and that being chosen by a book club  as his novel “The Corrections” was  could turn off male readers. He apologized, but was promptly uninvited to appear on her television show. In an interview with The Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul last month, Mr. Franzen was asked about the prospect of Ms. Winfrey’s choosing “Freedom” for her next book club selection. “I would be happy if she did,” he said.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/books/17arts-WINFREYANDFR_BRF.html

2010-09-17,Separation Anxiety,"Emma Donoghue’s remarkable new novel, “Room,” is built on two intense constraints: the limited point of view of the narrator, a 5-year-old boy named Jack; and the confines of Jack’s physical world, an 11-by-11-foot room where he lives with his mother. We enter the book strongly planted within these restrictions. We know only what Jack knows, and the drama is immediate, as is our sense of disorientation over why these characters are in this place. Jack seems happily ensconced in a routine that is deeply secure, in a setting where he can see his mother all day, at any moment. She has created a structured, lively regimen for him, including exercise, singing and reading. The main objects in the room are given capital letters — Rug, Bed, Wall — a ­wonderful choice, because to Jack, they are named beings. In a world where the only other companion is his mother, Bed is his friend as much as anything else. Jack, in this way, is a heightened version of a regular kid, bringing boundless wonder and meaning to his every pursuit.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Bender-t.html

2010-09-17,Straw Into Gold,"In the summer of 2009, the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art in New York was the site of a remarkable installation by the conceptual artist Song Dong. Its title, “Waste Not,” referred to a Communist government slogan exhorting the Chinese people to cope with their near-constant shortages and privations by practicing a vigilant form of salvage: nothing durable, however worn or dubious its utility, should be discarded. Song Dong’s mother appears to have followed the directive with unusual zeal, and after his father died in 2002, Song Dong decided her grief might be assuaged if she collaborated with him on a project that would alchemize into art the vast heaps of detritus she had accumulated over decades of state-encouraged hoarding. The result — an ingeniously arranged labyrinth of pens, cookware, buttons, magazines, clothing, shoes, plastic bottles, toys — was powerfully affecting. Walking through the grid of ribbons, buttons, toothpaste tubes, combs and gramophones was a challenge to consider how much our possessions say about us, how eloquently the humblest domestic artifacts communicate the joys and sorrows of family life, and how we can never save enough to protect ourselves from the inevitability of loss.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Prose-t.html

At a few minutes after 10 o'clock last night, however, the sufferer complained of a severe pain in the region of the heart and almost immediately became unconscious. Dr. Bliss, who was hastily called, at once announced that he was dying, and Mrs. Garfield and the consulting surgeons were summoned. Within 15 minutes President Garfield had drawn his last breath and the sorrowful intelligence was being sent with lightning speed throughout the country. Everywhere, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the bells were tolled as a mark of respect and sorrow for the long-suffering, patient, and heroic President.

2010-09-17,The Metafictional Club,"Before taking up a novel like Scarlett Thomas’s “Our Tragic Universe,” with its playful and portentous fixations on riddles, paradoxes and Zen koans, it may be helpful to engage in a few preliminary thought experiments. Is a seed placed in a pot and covered with dirt and water a flower? Is an assortment of bread, meat, cheese and condiments piled on a plate a sandwich? And is a sequence of fictional events, populated by characters and imbued with subtexts and recurring themes, a novel? In the abstract we cannot know, but in specific cases we should be able to answer conclusively. So how is it that this lively and thoughtful book possesses all the requisite elements of the thing it wants to be, and is so self-aware of what its components should be, yet lacks the essential spark that would make it a satisfying work of literature?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Itzkoff-t.html
2010-09-17,Runway Beauty | L’Wren Scott," The Serengeti-inspired color palette L’Wren Scott used for her spring collection was also the basis for the show’s hair and makeup. “L’Wren gave me fabric samples about three months ago,” said Lancôme’s artistic director for makeup, Aaron de Mey, who seemed preternaturally calm an hour before showtime (possibly thanks to all that notice, and perhaps also because he was departing for Capri immediately after the presentation). “I was inspired by Kiki de Montparnasse — she matched her eye makeup to her outfits,” he said. “It’s an old-fashioned idea, but a quirky one too.” To wit, he custom blended 10 shadows to match each models’ look and applied them over matte black so the effect wasn’t “too junior,” as de Mey put it.

2010-09-17,Hall of Mirrors,"The Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño has to be one of the most improbable international literary celebrities since William Burroughs and Henry Miller, two writers whose work Bolaño’s occasionally resembles. His subjects are sex, poetry, death, solitude, violent crime and the desperate glimmers of transcendence that sometimes attend them. The prose is dark, intimate and sneakily touching. His lens is largely (though not literally) autobiographical, and seems narrowly focused at first. There are no sweeping historical gestures in Bolaño. Yet he has given us a subtle portrait of Latin America during the last quarter of the 20th century — a period of death squads, exile, “disappeared” citizens and state-sponsored terror. The nightmarish sense of human life being as discardable as clay permeates his writing. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Greenberg-t.html

The ordered swirl of houses and streets, from this high angle, sprang at her now with the same unexpected, astonishing clarity as the circuit card had.” The architectural system unfolding in front of her held, according to Pynchon, a “hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/the-geometry-of-sprawl/

At this commemorative moment it is worth pointing out that a number of now-famous actors appeared on the series including Meg Ryan, Julianne Moore, Steven Weber and Marisa Tomei. Amazingly enough, the last three appear together in this scene of love gone brutally, badly and tediously wrong: Not only does this clip egregiously fail to suggest the talent of Julianne Moore in “Vanya on 42nd Street;” it fails to telegraph the talent of Steven Weber in “Wings.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/a-fond-farewell-to-as-the-world-turns/

2010-09-20,"Weekly Pick ‘Em: Lacking in Marquee Value, Not Intrigue","At first glance, this Saturday’s schedule seems like a comedown from last week’s. No Oklahoma-Florida State, no Ohio State-Miami, no Notre Dame-Michigan. In fact, there is only matchup between ranked teams this Saturday (No. 9 Iowa at No. 24 Arizona). But it would be remiss to think that the lack of marquee games means Saturday holds little intrigue. Several ranked teams will face serious early-season tests, some of them in hostile environments (just ask Texas Coach Mack Brown how much he’s looking forward to going into Lubbock to play Texas Tech and its new coach, Tommy Tuberville). Eighth-ranked Nebraska will not only be up against Jake Locker, but it will have to contend with the always intimidating atmosphere in Washington. Florida State returns home after getting blown out at Oklahoma last week, but the Seminoles don’t get much of a break when they host Brigham Young. Two A.C.C. teams, Georgia Tech and North Carolina, that have already seen their seasons go in a different direction than they wanted them to, play a game that is already critical for each. And Al Golden, the coach who has turned Temple around and is sure to be mentioned for some high-profile jobs at the end of the season, will see how his Owls fare against Connecticut of the Big East. What this weekend lacks in marquee value, it makes up for in intrigue. And that means that there is plenty of room for error when picking the games. As always, if you agree with the picks, disagree with them or simply find them laughable, feel free to chime in.

2010-09-20,‘Borat’ Star To Play Freddie Mercury,"Now that vérité-style comedies that try to present themselves as documentaries have been made totally passé, Sacha Baron Cohen has decided it’s time for a transition to the less controversial turf of the biopic. Mr. Baron Cohen, above left, the British comedian and star of “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” and “Bruno,” is planning to portray Freddie Mercury, above right, the frontman of the rock band Queen, who died in 1991, in a feature, the film’s producers said Thursday night. In a news release, the production company GK Films said it had signed Mr. Baron Cohen for an untitled drama focusing on the era surrounding Queen’s performance at the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert. The screenplay is by Peter Morgan, the “Frost/Nixon” playwright and writer of historical films like “The Queen” and “The Last King of Scotland.” The film’s producers, who also include TriBeCa Productions and Queen Films, did not indicate whether Mr. Baron Cohen would actually sing such demanding Queen songs as “We Are the Champions” or “Bohemian Rhapsody.” But he did get a chance to show off his throat  in more ways than one  in Tim Burton’s film version of “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.” GK Films said production would start next year.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/movies/18arts-BORATSTARTOP_BRF.html
2010-09-20,City Opera Chairwoman Explains Her Departure,"Susan L.

Ms. Baker was chairwoman during Mr. Mortier’s hiring and quick resignation, which was widely viewed as a debacle in the opera world. “I’m a great believer in chairs not overstaying,” Ms. Baker said. “So I put in place a committee sometime over the course of the past year to really commence a process for finding a new leader.” That new leader, as reported, will be Charles R. Wall, a former board member who recently retired as vice chairman of Philip Morris International. Ms. Baker said that she would stay active on the board, but that she and Mr. Wall still had to talk about her specific role. Ms. Baker declined to talk about the Mortier chapter. “I’m not interested in getting into that discussion,” Ms. Baker said.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/arts/design/18arts-CITYOPERACHA_BRF.html
2010-09-20,Nicole Kidman To Return To Broadway Next Year,"The Academy Award-winning actress Nicole Kidman plans to return to Broadway in the fall of 2011 to star in a revival of the Tennessee Williams play “Sweet Bird of Youth,” to be directed by David Cromer (“Our Town”), a spokesman for the production said on Friday. Ms. Kidman, left, was last on Broadway, in her debut, in the 1998-99 season production of David Hare’s play “The Blue Room.” That show drew mixed reviews but was a very tough ticket to come by, given Ms. Kidman’s star appeal. In “Sweet Bird,” Ms. Kidman will play Alexandra Del Lago, the faded, often-drunk movie star going around with the gigolo Chance Wayne; no word on who will play Chance. The original 1959 production on Broadway starred Geraldine Page as Alexandra and Paul Newman as Chance, who also starred in a film version; a 1975-76 revival, the last on Broadway, starred Irene Worth and Christopher Walken. Scott Rudin (last season’s Tony Award-winning “Fences,” the coming musical “Book of Mormon”) will be producing. The production and Ms. Kidman’s casting were reported in The New York Post.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/theater/18arts-NICOLEKIDMAN_BRF.html
2010-09-20,"‘Promises, Promises’ Will Close In January","One of Broadway’s biggest commercial hits of the year, the Sean Hayes-led revival of the musical “Promises, Promises,” will close on Jan. 2, the producers announced on Thursday night. The decision to close the show only nine months after opening is another reminder of the premium that producers put on star casting on Broadway  and the high costs and unpredictability of recasting. Beth Williams, one of the lead producers, said in a phone interview on Friday that the producers “considered recasting, started putting lists together, but we didn’t think there was a way to replace Sean and Kristin” Chenoweth and ensure extending the show’s financial track record as well. In a statement, the producers said they expected to recoup their original capitalization cost  they would not say how much it was, but it was at least in the high seven figures  and turn a profit for their investors, especially as the show heads into the lucrative holiday season. The show has grossed more than $25 million since opening in April. Its leading man and woman  Mr. Hayes (an Emmy Award winner for “Will & Grace”), above, and Ms. Chenoweth (“Wicked,” a Tony winner for “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown”)  are under contract only through the end of the year, and they were not re-upping. Katie Finneran, who won a Tony as Marge MacDougall, will pass on the role to Molly Shannon next month. A touring version of this production of “Promises, Promises” is now being discussed, Ms. Williams said.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/theater/18arts-PROMISESPROM_BRF.html

2010-09-20,‘Law & Order: UK’ Coming to BBC America,"NBC and its partners started remaking “Law & Order” for British audiences more than a year ago, and now those episodes are heading back to the United States, where they started. BBC America said Thursday that it would import “Law & Order: UK” beginning next month, with the premiere set for a Sunday, Oct. 3, at 10:30 p.m. Other episodes will be shown on Friday nights at 9. “Law & Order: UK” is the first foreign English-language iteration of the long-running crime series. It is produced by NBC Universal, Wolf Films and a British production company called Kudos Film and Television. The producers recycled scripts from the original “Law & Order,” set in New York, “to retain the grittiness” of that series, the BBC said. But the episodes were adapted to reflect the legal system in Britain. Dick Wolf, the executive producer of the “Law & Order” empire, told BBC News last year that legally, “the biggest difference here was the wigs.” He added, “The law is not really that dissimilar.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/arts/television/18arts-UKCOMINGTOBB_BRF.html

NBC ranked third for the night over all. CBS earned a first-place finish, and ABC was second with lineups of repeats.

There is no chain of command. No group or person is subordinate to any other. The tea parties are jealously independent and suspicious of any efforts at central control, which they see as a sure path to domination by outside interests … Lava is a pretty good analogy.

2010-09-20,Palin the Front-Runner?,"According to a bipartisan chorus — right, center-right, and liberal — the victory of Christine O’Donnell in Delaware’s primary proves that the race for the Republican nomination in 2012 is no longer wide open, because Sarah Palin is officially the front-runner. This strikes me as bunkum for many of the reasons that Ramesh Ponnuru and Daniel Larison discuss, and especially for this one: It is extremely unlikely that the political landscape in the winter and spring of 2012 will resemble the political landscape in the autumn of 2010. Even setting aside the unpredictability of economic developments, foreign-policy crises, and everything else that could shift the ground beneath our feet, the reality of having a more empowered Republican Party in Washington and a weaker President Obama in the White House will almost certainly work profound changes on the country’s mood — and yes, in the mood of the Republican base as well. (It’s hard to be quite so fired up and furious about socialism when Washington is mired in gridlock, and it’s hard to be quite so outraged at RINO perfidy when you’ve kicked a lot of the RINOs out of office.) The temper of conservative politics in the fall of 1994, the off-year election cycle that most resembles this one (it was a year, as Rich Lowry notes, when a former homeless man defeated the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee), bore little resemblance to the temper of conservative politics in 1996, when Bob Dole cruised to the Republican nomination over more base-pleasing candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm. And while it’s likely that the Tea Parties will lend a greater resilience to the present anti-establishment spirit, 12-t0-18 months of divided government will almost certainly have a dampening effect on the impulses that carried Christine O’Donnell to victory.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/palin-the-front-runner/

The Collegium, whose Web site still lists the English early-music specialist Andrew Parrott as its music director, gave its first concert in early 1999 and performed series through the 2006-7 season. The name has since surfaced almost solely in connection with an annual workshop, the Clarion-Collegium Week, instituted in 2008 and shared with the Clarion Music Society. That society, founded in 1957 by the period-instrument pioneer Newell Jenkins, who died in 1996, has been revivified under Steven Fox, its artistic director since 2005. The Collegium “will dissolve and continue its legacy under the umbrella” of the Clarion society, the release said. The directors, evidently speaking for the full board, pointed to the Collegium’s successes, but added, “We nevertheless believe that the current economic environment will not support the sustainability of an independent Collegium.” Clarion, they said, has made clear its intention to add several Collegium directors to its board, to continue the Clarion-Collegium Week and to “maintain a relationship” with Mr. Parrott.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/arts/music/20arts-ORGANIZERSDI_BRF.html

Earlier this year Starz adjusted the shooting schedule for the second season of “Spartacus”  the signature production of that premium cable channel  while Mr. Whitfield, right, was being treated for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; the adjustments included ordering a prequel to the series, which is moving forward. In June Mr. Whitfield was said to be cancer-free, and the second season was tentatively scheduled to make its debut in September 2011. The new diagnosis has upended that plan. “Our hearts and prayers are with Andy and his family during this difficult time,” Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Starz, said in a statement. “Andy is not only an incredible actor whose portrayal of Spartacus made an indelible impression on Starz audiences, he is also an amazing human being whose courage, strength and grace in the face of adversity have inspired all of us.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/arts/television/20arts-SPARTACUSSTA_BRF.html

In June the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and YouTube, in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, invited people to post videos on a special site, youtube.com/play, as part of an effort to uncover innovative work from outside the traditional art world system. The shortlist of 125 films  by students, video artists, photographers, filmmakers, composers, video-game programmers, a chess champion, an improv comedy troupe, an electronic music producer, a rock band and a hip-hop group  will be on display in kiosks at the Guggenheim’s museums, as well as on the YouTube channel. The Top 20 films will be decided by a jury made up of professional artists, including Takashi Murakami; Stefan Sagmeister, a graphic designer; Laurie Anderson, a performance artist; the music group Animal Collective; and the filmmakers Darren Aronofsky and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. “We artists can no longer call ourselves artists merely by discovering something special and presenting it to the public alone,” Mr. Murakami said in a statement from the museum. “In that way, YouTube has incited a revolution.” The finalists will be announced on Oct. 21 at the museum in New York.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/arts/design/20arts-GUGGENHEIMNA_BRF.html

In a ceremony timed to the 25th anniversary of Zappa’s Senate testimony, at which he compared the labeling of explicit records to censorship, and attended by Zappa’s widow, Gail, his sons, Dweezil and Ahmet, and daughter Diva, as well as Baltimore’s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a bust of the mustachioed, pony-tailed Zappa was unveiled atop a 12-foot pole outside the Southeast Anchor Branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library. It isn’t very large, but the bust is a replica of a similar sculpture in Vilnius, Lithuania. The duplicate was donated to Baltimore by the Lithuanian nonprofit organization ZAPPART. “He’d be wildly amused by this,” Gail Zappa told The A.P., “because of the absurdity of these guys in Lithuania coming up with this phenomenal sculptor who normally does busts of Stalin.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/frank-zappa-bust-unveiled-in-baltimore/

2010-09-20,‘Even Silence Has an End’,"Painfully, I tore myself away from the light, turned on my heels, and plunged into the thick matted darkness. It had begun to rain again. It was difficult to walk; every other step I tripped. I had my hands out in front of me to avoid obstacles. I couldn’t see a thing. I hadn’t managed to get hold of a machete, but I did have a flashlight. The risk involved in using it was as great as the fear that prevented me from using it. I went slowly into this threatening space and told myself I would switch it on only when I couldn’t take it anymore. My hands collided with wet, rough, sticky surfaces, and I expected at any moment to feel the burn of some violent poison. The storm was raging.

2010-09-21,The Peace Dividend,"On a crisp morning in Sarajevo, the filmmaker Danis Tanovic breezed through the front door of Delikatesna Radnja wearing designer sunglasses and a newsboy cap. There are something like 1,300 cafes in Sarajevo, each embodying a unique ambience and clientele — Zlatna Ribica (“the Goldfish”) has a speakeasy aesthetic and serves a famed Mexican coffee; Kino Bosna is a converted movie theater known for its live music, rakija (a local fruit brandy) and unabashed seediness. The Delikatesna Radnja, with floor-to-ceiling windows that face the Miljacka River and the mountains beyond, caters to the theater and film crowd. Tanovic, who directed “No Man’s Land,” winner of the 2002 Oscar for best foreign language film, is something of a celebrity here. While the waiter prepared macchiatos for us, Tanovic chatted up customers at nearby tables. With his heavy eyelids and tendency to speak out of the side of his mouth, he resembled a younger, stockier Robert DeNiro. He seemed to know everyone in the room.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/t-magazine/26remix-sarajevo-t.html

2010-09-21,Why Generic Ballots May Underestimate Democrats,"In the last couple of posts on our House forecasts, I’ve noted that the generic Congressional ballot tends to show worse results for Democrats than other indicators like polls of individual House races. The generic ballot, as of last week, pointed toward a Republican lead of 7 or 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to our estimates. Local polls are a little bit less straightforward to read because you have to make a lot of adjustments for polls that are (i) partisan, (ii) bad, or (iii) both. But in general — while there is a lot of variance from district to district — the local polls seem to point toward a House vote that would be about evenly divided.",U.S.,https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/why-the-generic-ballot-may-underestimate-democrats/

In 1939, carrying a suitcase stuffed with Kafka’s papers, Brod set out for Palestine on the last train to leave Prague, five minutes before the Nazis closed the Czech border. Thanks largely to Brod’s efforts, Kafka’s slim, enigmatic corpus was gradually recognized as one of the great monuments of 20th-century literature.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/magazine/26kafka-t.html

In Tangier, like many cities I visited in Morocco, it was not advisable to be out alone at night if you were not a male or accompanied by one. Come-ons aloud and whispered, being followed in cars, the occasional grab: none of these are much fun.

This refined ideal of beauty has made him the perfect photographer for Giorgio Armani, Polo Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein advertising campaigns. While working for Ralph Lauren, Phibbs formed an inspired partnership with the label’s chief creative officer, Alfredo Paredes, whose encouragement and art direction led to “Chasing Beauty” (Powerhouse; $50), the photographer’s first monograph, out next week. In his elegant foreword, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Cunningham succinctly describes the images as a “vastly interconnected series of marvels, different in their particulars, but alike in their ravishing, unorthodox perfections.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/athletic-association/

A cluster of sculptures made largely from papier-mâché, foam, gauze and cardboard, perched on low pedestals, intermingle with a pair of linen sheathed sofas and a chair that West created specially for the occasion. “I had the idea while watching my 3-year-old son looking up at the sculptures,” the artist says of the arrangement. “The seatings make for alternative positions and viewing platforms throughout the show.” The sculptures, which, depending on how you look at them and also maybe how old you are, might bring to mind enormous, melting ice cream treats, are as lumpy and charming as the seating is lean and angular. Both exude comfort in their own way. “When I was younger, I thought it was all right to make the visitor uncomfortable,” West says. “But now that I am older it would not be correct because my problems have gone.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/now-seating-franz-west-at-gagosian/

2010-09-24,‘Busted’,"Randy Britton e-mails: “I’ve noticed in much of the coverage of the BP oil spill that the press has taken to calling the oil well ‘busted.’ Since when is ‘busted’ the proper way to describe a broken oil well?  It seems very colloquial and not a form I would expect to see in proper journalistic forums.” Even now that BP’s troubled oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is being permanently sealed, news reports continue to refer to the “busted well,” particularly wire services like the Associated Press and AFP. Reuters was an early adopter, reporting on efforts to contain the “busted well” on May 3. Alternatively, busted has modified oil rig, or just plain rig. A database search of coverage of the BP spill finds the first recorded use of busted came nine days into the crisis on April 29, when the MSNBC host Ed Schultz said, “The busted rig is leaking — get this — 200,000 gallons of oil a day.” Is busted overly informal for journalists? The verb bust certainly has colloquial roots, beginning its life on the American scene as a folksy variant of burst. (The same dropping of the “r” turned curse into cuss, horse into hoss and parcel into passel.) Building on earlier use as a noun, bust busted out as a verb as early as 1806, when Meriwether Lewis, while on his famous expedition with William Clark, wrote in his journal, “Windsor busted his rifle near the muzzle.” Since then, bust has worked its way into a wide variety of American expressions.  “Bust runs the gamut from slang to standard,” explain David K. Barnhart and Allan A. Metcalf in their book “America in So Many Words.” “When it is used to mean ‘to explode or fall apart or be arrested,’ bust is generally slang. In the sense of failing (especially financially) it is informal, as busting the bank in gambling lingo, while in the specialized sense of taming a horse it is standard, the only way to say busting a bronco.” Despite its potential slanginess, busted is “not actually forbidden” in the news media, as the Boston Globe language columnist Jan Freeman wrote in August. Indeed, reporters often latch onto the occasional colloquialism that seems particularly expressive, and in this case, Freeman surmises they were drawn to the term’s “criminal-cowboy-macho connotations.” Regardless of the reasons for its current vogue, it’s notable that busted was rarely relied on by the press to describe stricken oil wells before the BP disaster — even in incidents that were highly similar, such as the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc I well in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the precursors I found come from more literary sources. It was appropriate, for instance, in some light verse by J.W. Foley published in The New York Times in 1904: Dear friend, there’s a question I’d like to ask you, (Your pardon I crave if it vexes) Have you ever invested a hundred or two In an oil well somewhere down in Texas? Have you ridden in autos (I mean in your mind), With the profits you honestly trusted Would flow from your venture in oil stocks — to find That the oil well was hopelessly busted?  I can’t find fault in reporters drawing on the rich history of bust and busted in American English to add a little extra oomph to their dispatches from the gulf. Calling the well busted does evoke a looser, wilder state of disrepair than broken, or the more technically accurate blown-out. But after many months of news coverage, the phrase “busted well” has now turned into little more than a cliché. That’s a far worse journalistic offense than a bit of well-placed slang.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/magazine/26onlanguage.html

Even pottering can be difficult when you are constantly in demand to judge this prize or sign that public letter, to give a blurb to old X or a recommendation to young Y.

The genre is noir, and it has its own argot (noir-got?).

How, that is, were great-­grandmothers not completely destroyed by enslavement, grandmothers not irreparably broken by bigotry, mothers not wholly defeated by loneliness? How have black women in this country kept on doing battle with everything, for what seems like forever, without falling apart? And what toll has this taken on their daughters? From Margaret Walker to Octavia Butler, Sherley Anne Williams, Toni Morrison and Gayl Jones, to name only a few, America’s black female authors have tried to make sense of a difficult present by writing bridges to the traumas of the past.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Glover-t.html

The modern concept of human rights, he says in “The Last Utopia,” differs radically from older claims of rights, like those that arose out of the American and French Revolutions. According to Moyn, human rights in their current form — applicable to all and internationally protected — can be traced not to the Enlightenment, nor to the humanitarian impulses of the 19th century nor to the impact of the Holocaust after World War II. Instead, he sees them as dating from the 1970s, exemplified by President Jimmy Carter’s effort to make human rights a pillar of United States foreign policy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Cooper-t.html

The hair was slicked down with Redken Hardwear 16 Super-Strong Sculpting Gel, and in the back it was coiled into two buns, which Palau intended to look “playful.” Perhaps to shake up the historical reference, the makeup artist Pat McGrath created a futuristic look she said she meant to look a bit androgynous: a strong brow, clean skin and a shiny slick of silver across the eyelids. The metallic shadow offset the bright colors and Carmen Miranda prints in the “minimal baroque” collection, and the graphic shape of the hair on the forehead meshed perfectly with Prada’s wacky eyewear.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/runway-beauty-prada/

Danielle Hope, the winner of the BBC television reality show “Over the Rainbow,” will play Dorothy. The production of L. Frank Baum’s classic tale will be directed by Jeremy Sams, choreographed by Arlene Phillips, with music and lyrics by Harold Arlen and E.Y.

2010-09-27,Weekly Pick ‘Em: Starting at the Top,"The list of intriguing games this Saturday starts right at the top, with No. 1 Alabama traveling to Arkansas to take on the Razorbacks and their Heisman hopeful, quarterback Ryan Mallett. The Tide has been dominant so far, and the return of Mark Ingram last week gives them even more firepower. This is the kind of game that makes coming out of the Southeastern Conference unscathed such a feat, as is South Carolina’s matchup with Auburn. Notre Dame has hit some bumps already in Brian Kelly’s first season as coach and it doesn’t get any easier this weekend, with No. 16 Stanford coming to South Bend. Andrew Luck has been spectacular for the Cardinal so far, and a big game against the Irish could give him a lot of confidence heading into the rest of the Pac-10 schedule. West Virginia and Louisiana State are both undefeated, but have still managed to seem somewhat suspect. Will the Mountaineers be able to overcome the hostile environment they are sure to be greeted with in Baton Rouge? But perhaps the weekend’s most intriguing game is Oregon State traveling to Boise State, where it will face the Broncos on the Smurf Turf. Boise State needs a convincing win to answer some of the critics now downplaying its victory over Virginia Tech. Of course, the Beavers have knocked off top teams before (just ask U.S.C.). Will the Broncos see their national championship hopes dashed or will they get through their final non-conference test without a blemish? We have our thoughts. Feel free to share yours.

These days, festivals tend to look very different, partly because their mission extends beyond the 10 or so days of the event itself. This might have interested the film theorist André Bazin, who in the early 1950s asked of the Cannes Film Festival, “Why can’t we have a serious geology as well as a flashy geography of our art?” At the time, Cannes didn’t present retrospective screenings that allowed festivalgoers to explore the history (geology) of cinema and not just its gaudy surface (geography).

NBC’s “Outsourced” (7.4 million) also made a promising start, about a million less than its lead-in, “The Office” (8.4 million), but considerably better than NBC’s returning comedies “Community” (five million) and “30 Rock” (5.8 million).

Last week, the Film Society of Lincoln Center paid its respects to the director, who died last year, with a 25th-Anniversary screening of his teen comedy “The Breakfast Club.” Now, Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, the filmmakers behind the dramas “Half Nelson” and “Sugar,” make their third directorial outing with a comedy inspired in part by Mr. Hughes’s work. “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” which opens October 8, is based on the young adult novel by Ned Vizzini and, much in the Hughesian tradition, features a teenage protagonist (Keir Gilchrist). Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden discussed Mr. Hughes’s impact in an interview for Arts & Leisure. While they didn’t aim to copy the director’s style, they did make a direct homage to “The Breakfast Club” in one scene. Below is a look at the scene from “Funny Story.”",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/its-kind-of-a-john-hughes-homage/

Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” with Michael Douglas, below, reprising his Oscar-winning role as the financial miscreant Gekko, sold about $19 million in tickets for first place at North American theaters over the weekend. Twentieth Century Fox, which spent an estimated $60 million to make the picture, said that 65 percent of the audience was over 30. “I think that bodes well because what we know about adult audiences is that they don’t rush out, but they do keep coming,” said Chris Aronson, Fox’s senior vice president for domestic distribution. The other major release of the weekend, “Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole,” finished second, selling about $16.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. That total was weak considering that “Guardians,” which Warner Brothers spent about $80 million to make, had premium-priced 3-D tickets to help prop it up. Ben Affleck’s “Town” (Warner Brothers) was a close third with $16 million  demonstrating impressive hold in its second weekend  for a new total of more than $49 million. The comedy “Easy A” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fourth with $10.7 million ($32.8 million total). “You Again,” a modestly budgeted comedy from Walt Disney Studios, landed in fifth place in its first weekend with about $8.3 million.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/movies/27arts-RETURNTOWALL_BRF.html

The players and the administration are locked in a dispute over how much of a salary cut the musicians should take and how their jobs should be redefined. The announcement came after a mediation session on Friday failed to produce any progress. The orchestra has been sustaining huge financial losses, mainly because of declines in ticket sales and donations; the players also blame bad decision-making. The administration, saying that major cuts are necessary for survival, is seeking to reduce the players’ base salary by 33 percent, and by 42 percent for incoming players. The musicians are offering a 22 percent reduction in the first year for both categories. (The base salary is $104,650.) The orchestra’s executives also want to loosen work rules so the musicians can be given other assignments, like coaching, teaching and playing chamber concerts. The Detroit Symphony faces perhaps the worst challenges of any major American orchestra at the moment, largely because of the city’s financial decline.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/arts/music/27arts-DETROITMUSIC_BRF.html

2010-09-27,"Waived by Rangers, Redden Faces Uncertainty","¶ The much-maligned Rangers defenseman Wade Redden, waived Saturday after two disappointing years with the Blueshirts, clears waivers on Monday without being claimed by another N.H.L. club. He and the $6.5 million cap hit he represents are now clear to go to the Rangers’ American League affiliate in Hartford. The long-anticipated move puts the Rangers beneath the salary cap and even leaves them with a couple of million dollars to make a new signing. But some believe that sending Redden to the minors (or to Europe, where he could sign with a club as former Blackhawks goalie Cristobal Huet did last month) could prove problematic under the collective bargaining agreement. Redden, a former N.H.L. all-star with Ottawa who once shared the league’s plus-minus award and played for Team Canada at the World Cup, I.I.H.F. World Championship and Winter Olympics, scored 5 goals and 40 points while going plus-3 in 156 games with the Rangers. Those stats are pretty good, but far short of the performance expected from a player who still has four years and $23 million left on his current Rangers deal. Redden does have a third option if he clears waivers: refuse to report to Hartford, which would void his contract and leave him free to seek a deal with another N.H.L. team, which will undoubtedly pay him much less.",Sports,https://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/redden-waived-by-rangers-awaits-next-move/

These are the kinds of conceptually charged objects cataloged in ‘‘The New Décor,’’ the book based on a recent exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London and traveling to the Garage in Moscow this month. Their purpose is not to elevate the trappings of domestic life but to question our very faith in them. ‘‘Contemporary artists are associating the home with a sense of movement, insecurity and precariousness,’’ says the Hayward’s director, Ralph Rugoff. ‘‘Rather than being a castle, home is a vulnerable place now.’’ While the more absurd pieces — like a giant hot-pink papier-mâché phallus bench by Franz West — explore our private space as a kind of public theater, others are more obviously unsettling. The Swiss artist Fabrice Gygi’s tented writing desk is somewhere between a child’s fort and a bomb shelter, and Jin Shi’s Chinese migrant worker’s dwelling is a chilling reminder of how the other half lives.

For the Sabres it’s the first of several keynote events in this, their 40th anniversary season. On Nov. 6 they will go to Toronto to play the Leafs, their neighbors and historic rivals, in the Hall of Fame game, and from Dec. 26 to Jan. 5 their downtown rink will play host to the world junior tournament. Back to the Hamilton area, where there are a fair number of Sabres season-ticket holders. Still, it’s slightly odd that the Sabres’ annus mirabilis should start near Hamilton, as their presence just 50 miles down the Queen E. Way is one of two reasons Hamilton cannot get an N.H.L. team (the other reason, of course, is the presence of the Leafs less than 50 miles the other way).",Sports,https://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/buffalo-and-hamilton-renew-their-love-hate-thing/

The decision, by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, overturns laws prohibiting “the keeping of a bawdy house, communicating for the purposes of prostitution and living on the avails of the trade.” The constitutional challenge was brought by two prostitutes and a dominatrix who was convicted under the bawdy-house law for running what she called the “Bondage Bungalow.” The ruling will not take effect for at least 30 days to allow Parliament to write new laws.

For this pocket version of the larger experiment, the scientists singled out a set of fraternal twin girls who already had been videotaped in the laboratory while wearing reflective markers. The angles of their knees during landing and cutting maneuvers had been analyzed, and the knees themselves measured. At the time of the taping, both girls’ knees were healthy.

The announcement came as a blow to many in Labour who saw the older Miliband, the former foreign minister, as the leader of the party’s moderate New Labour wing and a counterbalance to his more left-wing, pro-union brother. David Miliband said he wanted to spend more time with his family, and not to be the focus of “perpetual, distracting and destructive attempts to find division” within Labour.

Baldwin, a charming, well-born native of Baltimore who was the protégé of Ruby Ross Wood (see Lewis’s previous book, ‘‘The Great Lady Decorators’’), developed a bold, modern style that confidently mixed patterns and periods; he became the go-to decorator for people like Babe Paley, Cole Porter and Diana Vreeland, whose legendary ‘‘garden in hell’’ red living room he designed. Baldwin was never afraid of color and is said to have pioneered the use of aubergine walls, in a Maryland house (above) in the 1940s.

2010-09-30,The Best Director of His Era?,"Reading the near-universal (and richly-merited) praise for David Fincher’s “The Social Network,” it occurred to me that Fincher is gradually building a plausible claim to being the best filmmaker of his generation. Obviously defining “his generation” is a somewhat tricky thing — but suppose we do it roughly by decade, and compare his body of work to other filmmakers who came into their own between 1990 and 2005. (This ends up excluding the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh, who would otherwise provide some of his stiffest competition, as well as some recent bloomers like Jason Reitman.) Using that time frame, Fincher is up against Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Peter Jackson, Christopher Nolan, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Alexander Payne, Spike Jonze, Danny Boyle, Ang Lee, and no doubt some others I’m forgetting. Many of the directors on that list have made individual movies that might be better than a given Fincher film.

In this huge panorama, empires rise and fall, wars break out and characters of varying social backgrounds live mostly happy or mostly unhappy lives — mostly happy, more often than not, because Follett is an optimist, and firmly on the side of the good guys.

2010-10-01,"Two Brothers on the Road, and One’s Bad Company","It may be true — or at least closer to true now than in the past — that anyone can make a movie. But whether everyone should is another question. “Douchebag” is the second feature directed by Drake Doremus, and the best that can be said about it is that it shows reasonable technical competence. Mr. Doremus, a 27-year-old graduate of the American Film Institute, deftly mimics the restless camera movements and loose cutting associated with the do-it-yourself mumblecore aesthetic, giving a lived-in look to a pat, sentimental and not very believable story.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/movies/01douchebag.html

2010-10-01,From Popgun Hitter to Powerhouse,"Going into the 2010 season, Jose Bautista was not much more than a borderline major league starter, more valuable for his defensive versatility than for his hitting skills. After all, he had played every position except shortstop, pitcher and catcher, and his best single-season home run total was 16, with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2005. His career on-base plus slugging percentage, or O.P.S., was a pedestrian .729  more Skip Schumacher than Albert Pujols. ",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/sports/baseball/01score.html

In between, a married woman, Suzanne (Kristin Scott Thomas), and a single man, Ivan (Sergi López), fall in love, leading to bedroom panting, glazed post-coital smiles, domestic stress and storm, and a world that should be shattered but often comes across as canned.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/movies/01leaving.html
2010-10-01,Midnight’s Other Children,"In the spring of 1997, the literary quarterly Granta published an issue devoted to India’s Golden Jubilee. The tone was cautious but celebratory: on the cover, the country’s name was printed in bright red letters, followed by an exclamation point. Fifty years after partition, an independent India was rapidly establishing itself as an international power. The issue, which consisted largely of contributions from native Indians writing in English, was a testament both to the country’s extraordinary intellectual and artistic richness, and to one of the few legacies of British colonialism that could be unequivocally celebrated by readers in South Asia and the West: a common language. Seventeen years after Salman Rushdie’s shot across the bow with “Midnight’s Children,” a new generation of Indian writers was, in Granta’s words, “matching India’s new vibrancy with their own.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Chotiner-t.html
2010-10-01,Uncontrollable Urges,"It’s love that brings the blush of life to Ruth Rendell’s singular portraits of English eccentrics. No matter how quirky their personal foibles or how penetrating her analysis of their bizarre behavior, Rendell never loses affection for her beloved crackpots. And in PORTOBELLO (Scribner, $26), that warm feeling extends to the colorful market street in London’s Notting Hill where some of the city’s most peculiar characters tend to gravitate. As Rendell notes approvingly in her salute to the area’s rich history, vibrant personality and raffish street life, “eccentricity is the norm in the Portobello Road.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Crime-t.html

2010-10-01,Paperback Row,"HOMER & LANGLEY,  by E. L. Doctorow (Random House, $15.) Doctorow’s affecting novel uses the imagined experience of the Collyer brothers, who died within a labyrinth of trash in their Fifth Avenue brownstone in 1947, to evoke decades of American life. This “compassionate double portrait,” as Liesl Schillinger described it in the Book Review, succeeds in “elevating the Collyers beyond caricature” and turns them into “creatures of their times.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/PaperRow-t.html

The 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel has just begun, a war Hezbollah provoked by crossing the border and kidnapping two Israeli soldiers. Israel has responded with a massive bombing campaign; thousands of Lebanese Shiites are fleeing their villages in the south, traveling north to the relative safety of Beirut. Hezbollah, remarkably, has replaced bombed out roads and bridges to ease the evacuation. It has organized reception ­areas for the refugees.

2010-10-01,The Uses of Enchantment,"At 6 feet 5 inches tall, Roald Dahl was larger than life. His imposing and complicated personality makes all the more sense when you picture him as a near giant: Donald Sturrock notes that at their first meeting, “his body seemed larger than the doorway and far, far too big for the proportions of the cottage.” How to capture him in words? Dahl told Sturrock, “while munching on a lobster claw,” that “biographies were boring,” and Sturrock has set out to prove him wrong. He is significantly aided in this by the flamboyance of the subject himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Messud-t.html
2010-10-01,Living to Tell,"In Moscow back in the 1980s, frustrated by a conversation with a pedantically orthodox Soviet woman, I blurted out that I never really saw the moral distinction between Stalin and Hitler. I just wanted to be ornery, and I never expected the reaction I drew. She stared at me, then began to cry. It had been inculcated in her from birth that the Soviet Union, through great heroism and sacrifice, had rescued the nation and the civilized world from the scourge of fascism. Victory in the Great Patriotic War was the one unquestioned achievement of the Soviet state, endlessly glorified in art, song, film and monuments. Stalin’s crimes, by contrast, had been pushed into the deep background after Nikita Khrushchev fell from power in 1964, and there they remained, off limits to the public and concealed behind euphemisms like “mistakes” or “cult of personality,” for the duration of Leonid Brezhnev’s bland rule. People don’t like to have their myths punctured, and I knew it was a cheap shot on my part.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Schmemann-t.html

2010-10-01,Inside the List," CAPTIVE CROWD: When Ann Patchett’s winsome novel “Bel Canto” was published in 2001, she freely acknowledged that its plot — about an eclectic group of people held hostage by South American terrorists — had been inspired by an actual kidnapping in Peru several years earlier. By the time “Bel Canto” started its 16-week run on the paperback list in 2002, however, readers might have had a different true-life incident in mind: in February of that year, the Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt was seized by leftist guerrillas and held, along with a group of other people, in a series of spartan jungle camps. Their captivity lasted six and a half years. Betancourt, inset, who hails from a prominent French family (she holds dual French-Colombian citizenship), became one of the world’s most famous prisoners and a symbol of courage in the face of adversity.
