Last month, an all-star group of commentators made their way through Tolstoy’s “War and Peace.” This month, another distinguished crew (see their bios on the right) will spend two weeks tackling “The Education of Henry Adams,” an American classic published 100 years ago this year. Well, sort of: The memoir, which covers the years from Adams’s birth in 1838 to the death of Adams’s great friend the statesman John Hay in 1905, was printed in a luxurious private edition in 1907 and circulated to 100 or so friends — including then-president Theodore Roosevelt — who were invited to return it with comments and corrections in the extra-wide margins. (Only three complied.) The book was republished for a general audience in 1918, the year of Adams’s death. An unsigned review in the New York Times Book Review called it “a book every American should read.” It won the Pulitzer Prize. ",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/welcome-back/

Bush.” Mr. Chávez devoted almost none of his speech to the 69 amendments in the vote, which would centralize power in the president’s hands and abolish his term limits. He said he could see himself ruling until 2050, when he would turn 96. The tensions led the United States to break its silence. “We are concerned that people would not be able to have the free and fair elections that they deserve,” said Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/world/americas/01briefs-chavez.html

In the settlement, those involved with the Chicago production acknowledged that it contained “original and creative works” from the Broadway production and agreed to pay an undisclosed sum. The eyebrow-raising part of the lawsuit was the charge that Chicago copied the stage direction of the 2002 New York production. Some design elements and choreography are protected under copyright law, but there has not been a conclusive ruling on whether a director’s work is protected. John Rando, the director of the Broadway production, applied for copyright protection for his work but was turned down, and the Department of Justice intervened in the case, saying that the federal copyright office had acted properly in rejecting Mr. Rando’s plea.

2007-12-03,'Well-Adjusted',"When I first started reading about adoption, I kept coming across the words ""well-adjusted adoptee."" In 1970s the thinking was that adoptees should be content with their present lives and not think about their adoptions. I read studies on the Internet in the 1990s and it seemed little had changed. Questions beyond childhood curiosity and looking anything other than ""happy"" would get you labeled as having psychological problems or ""issues.""   Technically, I was a ""functioning"" adult — a stay-at-home-mom who cooked, cleaned, took care of her children like most of my friends. I wasn't prone to depression though there were times when I would go deep into thought. I laughed and cried, felt joy and anger like most people I knew. The difference was that I had a dirty little secret. I was actually thinking about my adoption and its effects on me.   When people asked why I was digging into my past, my typical reply was that I needed to know the truth to pass on to my children. But there was more to it than that. Answering the questions of why, who, when, where and how might also lead to some understanding of myself. My experiences as an adoptee didn't have everything to do with shaping me as a person, but how much it did was something I'd never considered before.   There were moments in childhood that turned my mind to questioning. As a young girl, I found my green card in my mother's purse. When I was 10, the arrival of another Vietnamese adoptee redirected my perspective from that of the adopted child to that of a Vietnamese adoptee. Then there was Binh, who'd I had come across on the Internet. Binh was Vietnamese and lived in England. Our contact was the first positive experience I'd had with another person from Vietnam.  We didn't talk about adoption or even Vietnam, but shared an interest in movies and anime. It's sad, but our online exchanges were the first real interaction on any ""normal"" level I'd had with another Vietnamese person. He was almost half my age but thoughtful and compassionate beyond his years. Often our discussions would center on how we felt about the world and our lives in it. This set into motion a process of reexamination. How had I gotten where I was and why? My inner eye eventually turned to my adoption.   Struggling to put my life back into the context of adoption was infuriating and deeply isolating at first. Part of the loneliness was self-inflicted; I felt many wouldn't have understood why I couldn't just ""move on."" The one family member to whom I disclosed my need to re-examine my adoption felt I'd lost my mind and even gave that impression to others. He suggested counseling. I felt insulted. What I needed wasn't therapy, it was understanding. I hadn't lost my mind; I was going through a process of reclaiming it. For the greater part of my life, I'd simply accepted what I'd been told.   To me, the suggestion of therapy meant I was ""maladjusted"" and needed to be readjusted — but to what? Adoption itself wasn't viewed as ""normal."" How do you assign a norm to an unusual situation? As more adult adoptees have grown into adulthood and spoken out about their experiences, changes in the way society perceives adoption are slowly being made.   Today, it's more acceptable for adoptees to question, to seek answers and even mourn their losses as some of us often do. As long as we eventually come to some sense of ""peace"" and go about our daily lives, all is well. It isn't until some of us become critical that we are confronted by a revised version of ""maladjusted."" This new term implies the same thing as the old but with a twist. We've come to be known as ""the bitter, angry adoptees.""   When I first began writing critically about my adoption on my blog, I was surprised by this and even more so to learn I'd been smacked with the same label. While there were a few readers who tried to understand without judgment, there were still those who couldn't get past their misperceptions. People online who didn't even know me gave me well-intentioned advice on how to resolve my ""anger issues."" Others suggested therapy and still others told me to ""grow up."" It was still the same attitude, but the language had changed.  I would get e-mails from adoptive parents who would often argue that ""things are so much better for adoptees now."" But are they? I felt the statement was dismissive and showed a lack of understanding. The labeling itself seemed a sign that some things were not better. Why did it seem anger was not an acceptable emotion for an adoptee to feel?  Many adoptees have valid reasons for being angry. Should someone else decide that those reasons are not valid? Who defines socially acceptable norms? Based on what? I feel these are questions that should be asked. And I think that the answers are at the heart of the ""bitter adoptee"" label.   Just like many in the adoptee community, I'm not willing to settle for ""better."" To stop thinking about it now would mean settling into complacency. I know all too well what happens when the mind stops thinking critically. The pressure to conform to someone else's expectations can be overwhelming. In my desire to appear ""well-adjusted."" I resorted to denial and suppression. I became a chronic people-pleaser as result of my attempts to blend into my surroundings.  It would be a lie for me to say I'm not still angry. I am, but people often misunderstand what I am angry about. I came to terms long ago with the fact that I'm adopted. I've even begun to come to terms with many of my negative experiences that involved racism, isolation and even deception. Much of my anger comes from people labeling me with dehumanizing, dismissive and misleading terms. It also comes from frustration about the condescending attitudes we often face when we speak out. Sometimes it's simply conviction and determination.  There is a difference between anger and all-encompassing, blind rage. I write about painful, anger-inducing experiences because I wasn't allowed to explore them before. Writing publicly about them also contributes to the understanding of the complexities of adoption. As a society, I think we still have an overly simplistic view of adoption. While current studies may scratch the surface by studying the different aspects of adoption, the ""either/or"" idea is still prevalent. Adoption is either good or bad. Either you're for it or against it. The adoptee is either well-adjusted or maladjusted.  I think the reactions of some adoptive parents are sometimes rooted in fear that their children might turn out to be one of the ""the bad ones."" I believe most adoptive parents genuinely love their children. They don't want them to be miserable, but that fear is often based on that same all or nothing misconception. Just as adoption itself can't be painted over with a broad brush, neither can adoptees — as a community or as individuals. We also can be paradoxical in nature. I am thankful for what I have but I still mourn what I've lost. I can acknowledge my anger but still think past it to laugh and enjoy life.   Many of the adoptees I know who were initially labeled as ""bitter"" or ""angry"" have gone on to do some pretty incredible things. Some have become accomplished writers and artists, formed organizations, become socially and politically aware and active. Some have even entered the field of adoption as professionals. No longer content to adapt and conform, many adoptees are now working toward social change. The ""angry, bitter ones"" are just a part of a greater whole existing as productive members of that community.  For many like me, critiques on adoption are not just about our own experiences. It just began there. Our eyes have turned toward the next generation, to first mothers and beyond. It doesn't stop at our front door as we've begun to delve into subjects like adoption ethics, racism, civil rights, economics and politics. Angry? Yes, some of us are but sometimes that's a necessary element. History is full of examples. Should we dismiss the Boston Tea Party as a mere temper tantrum? Why are some adoptees getting a bad rap from some adoptive parents? I think it's because adoptees are still thought of as ""the lucky ones,"" the ones who were ""saved."" What do we have to complain about?   Of course, I can only speak for myself. There will be adoptees out there whose experiences and opinions differ. ""We"" only refers to those with whom I share certain commonalities, nothing more. Yes, ""we"" have made progress, but many feel we still have a long way to go. Building our communities and support systems was just the beginning and it seems we're in it for the long haul.

The driftwood clotted the shore; it was the end of summer now, and the cove was still, but in winter massive branches and trunks churn up out of the water of Puget Sound. Bone-white roots clawed at the air on this late afternoon; Gardner’s grandchildren climbed across them. His walk was a vigorous lurch. One foot twisted inward, one knee buckled. His torso keeled slightly with each step. He has Parkinson’s. He was governor of Washington State for two terms in the 1980s and ’90s. He is 71, and his last campaign is driven by his desire to kill himself. “I can’t see where anybody benefits by my hanging around,” he told me, while his blond grandchildren, sticks prodding, explored the water’s edge.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02suicide-t.html

2007-12-03,Comics,"Cartooning is always subjective, so when you look at political comics, it’s useful to think about where their arguments can lie — not just in their words but in the implications of their visual style. If you were to read only Andrew Helfer’s text for RONALD REAGAN: A Graphic Biography (Hill & Wang, $16.95), for instance, it would seem to be a straightforward chronological trot through Reagan’s life story, with particular attention paid to the showmanship of his public persona and his weakness for self-serving fabrications. Most of the book’s spin, though, is actually in its artwork, by Steve Buccellato and Joe Staton. After an opening montage of notable moments from Reagan’s public life, which might as well have been sketched from publicity photos, “Ronald Reagan” becomes a catalog of the sorts of visual rhetoric cartoonists can pull off: nearly every panel incorporates some kind of broad caricature or symbolic distortion, usually at Reagan’s expense. On a single page, we see a smiling Reagan hobnobbing with three other Screen Actors Guild board members while Jane Wyman checks her watch; then Reagan and Wyman sweating, smiling and pushing away enormous tough guys with shirts labeled “Union”; then a quizzical Reagan (with a question mark over his head) watching a man with a fez and a hammer-and-sickle jacket whispering in someone’s ear; and finally the editorial-cartoon shorthand of an eagle and a bear standing on a broken swastika and scowling at each other.

2007-12-03,"Correction: Language as Sculpture, Words as Clay",An article on Oct. 21 about the artist Lawrence Weiner misstated the duration that manhole covers he created with the assistance of the Public Art Fund were to remain in 19 locations below Union Square. The manhole covers are to remain there indefinitely; they were not removed several months after their installation in 2000. The article also gave an erroneous description of Mr. Weiner’s personal copy of the Public Art Fund manhole cover in front of the Whitney Museum. That manhole cover is nonfunctional; it did not replace a working manhole cover.

No wonder, then, that I now have not one but two copies of Simon Hopkinson’s “Roast Chicken and Other Stories” on my kitchen counter — the U.K. edition, already dog-eared and grease-and-gravy-stained, and an arguably more pristine copy of the new American edition, which came out in September. “Roast Chicken” is one of those rare cookbooks that, once opened, becomes indispensable — perhaps because it takes so many of the dishes you thought you had already mastered and, quite simply, does them that much better. Foodies know it as the winner of the 1995 Glenfiddich award for best food book, and publishers know it as the book that trumped Harry Potter on Amazon.com’s British best-seller list. The British magazine Waitrose Food Illustrated named it the most useful cookbook ever, but here I must disagree. “Roast Chicken and Other Stories ” is far too idiosyncratic to be labeled “useful.” Rather, it is deliciously random and highly opinionated.

2007-12-03,Save the Date,"There’s something a little bit infectious about the Dolphin Studio’s calendar ($50), silk-screened by the ceramic artist John Ffrench and his wife, Primm, who have been making these folksy, colorful prints from their home studio in Stockbridge, Mass., for 37 years. All of the family members, including their grandchildren, have been contributing artwork since they were old enough to hold a brush. “I don’t think we’ve ever said, ‘Oh, no, that won’t do,’ ” Ffrench says. Production grows each year (they’re up to 1,500), since nearly every calendar giftee becomes a gifter. Here’s an example: this writer gave one to Daily Candy’s Crystal Meers; Aimee Acord (the sister of the cinematographer Lance), who saw it at Meers’s house, gave one to the designer Jane Mayle — who then produced sweaters bearing interpretations of the designs for Barneys Co-op. “The images were so strong graphically and so very charming that it was hard not to do something with them,” Mayle says. “Looking at my calendar on the wall every day just seemed a little small and selfish.” The family now has a Web site. “I’m the computer person, and I’m a little wobbly,” Primm says.

2007-12-03,Once Upon a Time in China,"Here’s a lesson in the graceful acceptance of defeat. In 1298, the Genoese navy bested the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Curzola. Unable to live with the disgrace, one Venetian commander, Andrea Dandolo, killed himself by beating his head against his ship’s mast. Another Venetian leader, Marco Polo, surrendered calmly, was taken prisoner and spent a few years writing his memoirs in comfortable captivity. Dandolo’s fame died on the deck; Polo’s will outlive our grandchildren. Few famous names have as much vagueness attached to their exploits, though. Marco Polo opened Asia to European trade, so we’re told, but we generally don’t know much else. Laurence Bergreen remedies that by bolstering Polo’s reputation and arguing for his historical importance in a book as enthralling as a rollicking travel journal. Bergreen, who has written biographies of Louis Armstrong, James Agee and Irving Berlin, turned his attention to ancient explorers with “Over the Edge of the World,” which tracked Ferdinand Magellan’s circumnavigation of the globe. I was a fan of that book, but “Marco Polo” far outshines it, and not surprisingly. Marco Polo, unlike Magellan, left his biographers a masterpiece of a memoir to work with.

Since then, I’ve dropped them, I’ve broken them, I’ve had them stolen on the subway, I’ve lost them in taxis. When I was working on the Mira Nair film “Monsoon Wedding,” I fell almost 10 feet into an empty pool. As I was falling, I hallucinated that the Leica was my baby. I held it against my chest and landed with all my weight on my wrist and broke it into a million pieces. But I saved my Leica. Over the years, I’ve learned that the lens is a very subjective relationship. The reason I use a Leica is because it actually has a subtext. It depends on what you’re photographing, but the lens shows you not just the surface: the levels underneath are revealed. Somebody told me once how optically this was possible.

2007-12-03,A ‘Normal’ Family,"It happened again — this time before Halloween — as we reached the cashier's station at The Party Store.  The clerk, who must have been about 18, took a long look at my daughters.  ""Are they yours?"" she asked.  ""Yes,"" I said tersely, hoping my tone would dissuade further inquiry.  It didn't.  ""Are they adopted?"" she asked.  Now I was ready to give her a blast, a lecture about manners and boundaries.  ""Yes, they are — ""  But the young woman cut me off, interrupting with a perky, ""I'm adopted, too!""  Oh. Um, never mind.  In the last year or so, I've noticed that I have these kinds of conversations more and more. People who once would have intruded with a boorish question seem to have been replaced by others who want to share their own abiding connection to adoption. They were adopted themselves. Or they're in the process of adopting — a ""waiting family."" Or their grown son or daughter is on his or her way back from overseas, about to make them a grandparent.  In fact it seems to me — dare I say it? — that adoption is becoming normal. Or least more normalized. Sure, it's taken 60-some years. But attitudes are changing. And that's not my imagination.  Ten years ago, 58 percent of Americans had a family member or close friend who had adopted a child, were adopted themselves, or had placed a child for adoption, according to a national survey by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York. By 2002, that figure had risen to 63 percent. It's surely higher now.  The same studies found that the percentage of Americans who have seriously considered adopting a child rose from 36 percent to 39 percent — a 3 percent increase that's statistically insignificant, but which the institute believes may mark the start of a permanent change in the way people think about how to build their families.  Adoption is routinely in the news these days, and not just because Brangelina and Madonna have new children. The coverage reflects the sheer number of people who are adopting, particularly from overseas, and the way in which each individual adoption radiates outward, from nuclear family to extended family to friends and co-workers. In the last 15 years, nearly 62,000 children have arrived from China alone. Another 76,000 have come from Russia and Guatemala. Today more are coming from African nations like Ethiopia.  Most of those families couldn't hide their adoptions if they wanted to — and they don't. That's a big change from the 1950s and 1960s, when adoption was a secret so shameful it had to be kept even from the child.  When that clerk spoke up at The Party Store, my daughters paid no attention. Sure, Jin Yu, 7, was busy admiring her High School Musical cheerleader costume. Zhao Gu, 4, had her arms wrapped around her Dorothy of Oz dress, perhaps contemplating the most efficient means to dispose of unwanted witches. But it was more than that. Both of them know adoption as a common word in their household and a routine fact of their lives.  Four adopted children live on our street. Jin Yu's best friend is adopted. So is a boy in her first-grade class. And a teacher at her school. None see it as extraordinary. Which is not to say things are perfect.  Adoptive Families magazine recently carried the story of a Florida woman who was asked to prove that she was her daughter's mother before hospital personnel would treat the child. It's impossible to conceive of a biological parent being asked to verify the same relationship. And every adoptive parent I know has endured frustrations like my own: The woman who approaches our group at a restaurant, demanding to know who among our girls are the ""real"" children. The relative who laments that I never had ""children of my own,"" oblivious to the little girls beside me. The strangers who feel free to ask why my wife and I adopted and how much it cost — as if the doctors and nurses who deliver babies work for free.  I wonder how these folks would feel if I turned the tables, if I were to tap them on the shoulder while they and their child waited in line for a movie or a seat at a restaurant. ""Hey, was your daughter born by in-vitro? She looks in-vitro to me. Am I right or am I right?""  Last summer we were on vacation in Germany when Jin Yu tugged on my arm.  ""Dad,"" she said, ""those boys keep pointing at me. Why are they pointing at me?""  I knew why. But I didn't want to say. Because I hated that the rudeness of strangers should compel me to explain to my daughter — again — that some people see our family as different. So I didn't respond at first, and in that moment's pause Jin Yu answered her own question with the very words her father should have offered:  ""It's not polite to point,"" she said.  No, it's not.  It's encounters like that one that make me brace for wounding questions — more and more to find that I needn't have worried. Not long ago, I was leading Zhao Gu along a beach at the Jersey shore.  ""Excuse me,"" a woman said from her seat on a towel, ""is your daughter from China?""  ""Yes, she is,"" I said — and kept walking.  But in a moment the woman was on her feet, trying to catch up with me in the sand.  ""We're a waiting family!"" she called.  Oh. Why didn't you say so?

The sheet is one of only two surviving leaves from the original score. On its reverse side it also carries, in Mozart’s hand, the parts for two horns for two unidentified pieces. Simon Maguire, the senior specialist in Sotheby’s music department, said: “What makes the survival of this sheet particularly noteworthy is the fact that cadenzas are perhaps the least likely part of any musical piece ever to be written down. Cadenzas were usually improvised, so there was no need for written guidance from composers. In this instance, because the concerto is a work for two instruments, Mozart worked it out in advance and wrote it out separately to avoid the two instruments improvising independently and clashing.” The sheet is expected to sell for more than the estimate of $205,000.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/arts/music/03arts-MOZARTMANUSC_BRF.html

The issue has been that the studios want to charge more money for downloads than Mr. Jobs thinks they are worth.

2007-12-03,Brooks Brothers Migrates to the West,"The new Brooks Brothers store on Broadway at 65th Street. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) Slide Show: Brooks Brothers on Broadway Even in an era of rampant brand extension, there is something incongruous about the sight of a Brooks Brothers store at Broadway and 65th Street, which was still “West Side Story” territory in the days when Brooks was outfitting John F. Kennedy in sack suits.  You could say, cynically, that this is merely a sign that the venerable clothier is now no more than a Banana Republic chain for the next-higher income bracket. Or you could say that Brooks Brothers is really returning to its roots, since it conducted business on Broadway from 1858 to 1915, moving steadily uptown all the while.  Lou Amendola, the chief merchandising officer for Brooks Brothers, can look at a map of Manhattan and see the 9,500-square-foot Lincoln Square branch, which formally opened today, as following naturally in a northwesterly migratory pattern going back to 1818 and the original store at Catharine and Cherry Streets.  Brooks Brothers’ first appearance on Broadway was at the corner of Grand Street. Abraham Lincoln shopped here. (What other customer would have needed an overcoat for his second inauguration with a quilted lining embellished by an embroidered eagle holding a “One Country, One Destiny” pennant in its beak?) The store then moved briefly to Union Square.  At 670 Broadway, on the corner of Bond Street, Brooks opened its next headquarters — a Victorian confection designed by George E. Harney. “Externally it is an ornament to the street,” The New York Times declared on April 11, 1874, “and its internal arrangements are of the most perfect kind.” The building is still an ornament in NoHo. Recent retail tenants have included the Top Tomato produce store and the Wet Seal clothing store.  Brooks moved up Broadway to 22nd Street in 1884. Here, it introduced Americans to the button-down polo collar shirt, the polo coat, the Shetland sweater and the silk Foulard necktie. Brooks moved to its current flagship, at Madison Avenue and 44th Street, in 1915. Though much altered, the 22nd Street building still stands. If you visit Domain Home Fashions today, you can still see the great cast-iron columns of the main selling floor, where men’s suits were once piled high. (That’s how they displayed them, in piles, turned inside out so customers could see the fine linings.)  Are there more neighborhood Brooks Brothers to come? “The potential is definitely there,” Mr. Amendola said through a spokesman. The challenge, he added, is finding the right space to accommodate a full range of the store’s offerings.  If the company is thinking about NoHo, it is worth noting that there is an 11,250-square-foot corner storefront now available. At 670 Broadway, on the corner of Bond Street.

Adams’s “Dynamic Theory of History,” developed during a decade in which he was also playing with magnets and seeking revelation in the statistics of coal production, proceeds from a late-life awareness of himself a “a conscious ball of vibrating motions, traversed in every direction by infinite lines of rotation or vibration.” His discovery that, as of 1900, the world would “not be a unity but a multiple” freed him to write a memoir whose own ever-increasing entropy could be rationalized as a shape to suit the times.",Books,https://readingroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/adamss-dark-matter/

2007-12-05,Blood Ties and Acts of Love,"As I look at my ever-growing and protruding belly, I find myself fascinated by the biological processes at play: sperm, egg, and a baby being made. I imagine that any woman experiencing this process for the first time would find it, as I do, an exciting but mystifying and often uncomfortable journey. In my own first three months I wondered, Why does anyone go through this?   As an adopted person my context for the way babies come into the world is through adoption, not birth. Of course I understand birth, but that is not the way I came into my family. I did not grow up knowing the people who gave birth to me. But I do not doubt the labor my adoptive parents went through to get me. It consisted of mounds of paperwork and home studies that stretched over two years. I thank God pregnancy is just 9 months.   In anticipating the birth of my child, I feel like an explorer getting ready to delve into a foreign land that is also somehow familiar. I did not grow up in the culture of blood; I grew up in the culture of adoption. The ties that bind me to my family are not based in biology. They are based in relationship.   But for the first time, I and my husband -– who happens to also be adopted from South Korea -– will, through our child, know what it is to be connected with someone who also shares our genes. And I must admit there is something delicious about finally being a part of the majority.   But it could get complicated. Like when we have to make a family tree. And have to explain how our little Korean child came from Irish, German, English and Italian ancestry. Although our child will look at our faces and will see familiar curves and lines, the extended family will not look as familiar. And so we will have to explain our adoption so our child can understand why grandma has blond hair and grandpa has blue eyes and we don't.   Part of the legacy we will also give our child is the loss of genetic ancestry. We will have to explain why mommy and daddy did not grow up with the parents who gave birth to them and why we got new families. And even though I have met my birth family, I do not know the family history. And knowing the history is not just knowing one's genes, it's knowing the stories going back generations.   Even though I hope to someday bring our child to Korea to meet extended biological kin, my husband and I cannot provide all of the skills needed to be effective in that culture. We don't speak Korean in the home; nor do we cook Korean food regularly. Although we have become very knowledgeable about Korean culture and have connections to the Korean-American community, I wonder about our ability to nurture our child's racial and cultural identity.   I am relieved, though, that my child will not have to answer the question ""Why were you born?"" the way I had to answer the question, ""Why were you adopted?"" I am glad that my child will not be told by well-meaning strangers he or she is ""lucky"" to have been born. And I certainly won't tell my child to be grateful because I brought them into the world. And if my child feels any gratitude toward me I hope it is because I earned it.   It will be important to remind ourselves that it is because of our own needs, not theirs, that we bring children into our lives to parent. Being able to have the gift of a child born to me allows me to reconnect to that which I had lost as a consequence of adoption. But I also know that to also have the gift of a child adopted by me would allow me to continue the culture I most understand -- the culture of adoption.   I anticipate that generations and generations after me will slowly erase my history. They will most likely forget that their great-great-great grandmother had to learn to be Korean. That she came to America at 3 and a half years old in a little red pant suit and vest, and white sweater trimmed in red. That she cried to return to her motherland. And that the mothershe loved had blond hair and the father she loved was an Irishman. Ultimately I want generations after me to know this about the culture of blood and the culture of adoption: That blood is thicker than water, but love can be thicker than blood.

2007-12-07,Art Murmur | Update from Art Basel Miami," For the second year in a row, the pool at The Raleigh is proving too inviting to resist. At Jeffrey Deitch’s late-night party, there were so many skinny-dipping galleristas that the scene resembled a Spencer Tunick photo… Turns out the ripped-from-the-Colosseum Roman soldiers clanking around town are not here for a sword-and-sandals convention but to hype a freshman fair, Roma Contemporary, making its debut in February… It seems there’s safety in numbers at this year’s fair. More and more dealers are sharing spaces, forging “Survivor”-like alliances to avoid being voted off next year, when the fought-after spots are reassessed by the new regime. Mary Boone and Rafael Jablonka from Cologne have the smartest set-up: a room each to do with as they will and a third make-nice space for Eric Fischl, the one artist the two galleries share… Massive steroid-charged artwork is not limited to the main fair. It also gets a workout at Pulse, where there is a courtyard stocked with jacked-up sculptures by Jurgen Mayer, Chris Larson and the tattooist-cum-fine artist Duke Reilly. Reilly’s work is a replica of a revolutionary war submarine called the “Turtle,” which in truth looks more like an old whisky barrel. The larkish Reilly submerged his work in the Hudson River early this year and “attacked” the QM2, an offence which got him arrested (the $120,000 tag for the piece includes a video of his capture)… It’s not just the wholesale appropriation trend that is trying the patience of gallerists. As the circuit hits 23 fairs and counting, FedEx and other couriers cannot handle the volume of art that’s zipping round the world. Galleries will soon have to find alternative methods, with many acknowledging that delivery delays have been worse than ever. Some shipments failed to arrive. For the first day, Berlin’s Galerie Michael Schultz had to make do with a minimalist set up of two canvases (the rest of the booth showed up last night); while a Danish gallery canceled completely when they received word that its shipment wouldn’t make it in time. That was good news for on person at least: the booth-less Aussie art collective The Glue Society was promoted into the space to exhibit its waggish light boxes, which show satellite images of what appear to be ancient Biblical scenes.

Ms. Lessing, who grew up in Africa, wrote of poverty-stricken schools in Zimbabwe where students yearn for books, while students at a privileged London school that she once visited read little. She criticized the Internet for having “seduced a whole generation into its inanities” and ended with an anecdote about a pregnant mother of two “somewhere in southern Africa” who must travel to procure scant water for her family and yet craves a copy of “Anna Karenina.” Ms. Lessing concluded: “I think it is that girl and the women who were talking about books and an education when they had not eaten for three days, that may yet define us.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/08/books/08arts-ANOBELISTSAC_BRF.html

Mr. Mortier has long said that the State Theater will have to close for a few months and has promised all new productions for at least for the 2009-10 season, his first in charge. In an interview, he said it was “likely” that the theater would go dark for the spring of 2009, with work done in time for rehearsals to begin in August. However, he and Ms. Baker said that no decision on a closing had been made, and that none would be until after a board meeting on Wednesday.

Traub wound up talking to Annan 18 times, as well as to his closest aides. The result is an incisive, meticulously researched study of the problems of collective action at the post-cold-war U.N. Although “this benevolent and somewhat cryptic sovereign,” as Traub calls him, had the best intentions, he was no match for the power politics and scheming he encountered.

2007-12-10,Inside the List,"BECK V. COOPER: Glenn Beck, the conservative CNN news personality, has the new No. 1 title on the nonfiction list: “An Inconvenient Book: Real Solutions for the World’s Biggest Problems.” To promote it, he appeared recently as a guest on his own show, where he faced off against Anderson Cooper, also of CNN, in what was a strangely gripping hour of television. Beck versus Cooper — the noisy populist versus the dapper mandarin — felt like a class war and a seriocomic switchblade match for the soul of CNN. Cooper kicked things off by introducing Beck half-jokingly as, among other things, a “cable news rodeo clown” and “man of mystery.” The first words out of Beck’s mouth were: “I am not afraid of you.” Things went downhill — or uphill, depending on your perspective — from there. The men kept smiling but tangled over issues like global warming and immigration. When Cooper said “most scientists say yes” while asking if man is to blame for climate change, Beck replied: “Ooh. Most scientists say yes. Wow. You got me there. That’s why you’re on ‘60 Minutes.’ ” Beck called Cooper “Mr. I-Hang-Out-in-Africa” and said, “So anyway, talk down to me some more.” Cooper asked: “If Iran is the head of the snake, who’s the tail?” Beck’s reply: “You.” Near the end of the program, Cooper asked: “How long does it take for you to spray on your hair? I’m just asking.” Who won this battle? I don’t know. But by the end, Cooper did ask, “How come I’m the only one sweating here?” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/09tbr.html

Many people misread his words and imagined Brown wanted to find values unique to Britain — “British values.” More careful readers noted that what he was looking for was a particularly British expression of the Enlightenment beliefs common to, say, France or the United States, whose catchy slogans (“liberty, equality, fraternity” and “land of the free”) he seemed to envy.

Though Meisner claimed a prior engagement, skeptics suspected otherwise. Meisner had insisted that only a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs could substitute for the original Gothic window, which was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II and never suitably replaced. Richter, however, delivered something wholly unexpected: an abstract composition of 11,500 identically sized units — at 14.5 square inches each, they are frequently compared to pixels — in 72 colors, the arrangement of which was determined randomly by a computer program.

But as of Oct. 10, it became a viable business model. That was the day Radiohead made its seventh studio album, “In Rainbows,” available for download online. Customers were invited to pay whatever they wished. Clicking on the question mark on the Radiohead site led to a screen that read, “It’s up to you.” Clicking on that led to another message: “No, really. It’s up to you.” According to early estimates, 1.2 million downloaded the record in the first two days, earning the band somewhere between $1 million and $5 million. Soon after, the withered husk of the recording industry gently commenced to collapse on itself. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09radiohead.html
2007-12-10,The Dutiful Daughter,"As a young man, Harold Klein is so scrawny that a fellow passenger on the train taking him to medical school wonders if he’s old enough to be traveling alone. It is South Africa in 1938: a country with a color bar, but not yet caught in the steel cage of apartheid. Harold’s father, Joseph, is a Jewish shopkeeper in a town a few hundred miles from Cape Town, and the family’s position is equivocal: they’re neither Boer nor quite English. When Harold sees newspaper reports of an Afrikaner re-enactment of the Great Trek, the 19th-century wagon-train journey that colonized the Transvaal, his father reminds him, “It’s not our holiday.” In time, Harold will become a country practitioner; he will marry and have two children of his own, both of whom will move to the United States. He’ll have a long life, long enough to see his country change. And then he’ll die, of a uremia that sends him into a coma and puts “a yellow smell in the air.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/Gorra-t.html

That’s because the poetry world, like most areas of American life, has its own peculiar celebrity system — and if the rewards of that system rarely involve gift suites filled with swag from Jean Patou, they remain tempting enough to keep grown writers hustling. The problem is, poetic stardom is an unpredictable business. Good writing doesn’t guarantee a reputation; bad writing doesn’t guarantee oblivion; nor can grace, money or nimble careerism entirely explain why Poet X reads to overflowing auditoriums, whereas Poet Y reads to his cats. Maybe it’s simply the case that, as William Munny remarked in “Unforgiven,” “deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/Orr4-t.html

The most popular is FunWall, which is like an electronic wall where your friends can put up videos, photos and rude comments. FunWall has about 3.5 million active users and was designed by Slide, a small California company that has seized the widget moment. Many Facebook applications, though, are created by individuals or groups of two or three people. RateBeer, designed by Jonathan Kelly (about to graduate from California Polytechnic next year), has acquired from Facebook members more than 400,000 ratings of 19,000 beers.

But when food crops are used as fuel, difficulties may follow. The vogue for corn ethanol has driven up the price of corn around the world, putting the poor in jeopardy. (An expert affiliated with the United Nations went so far as to label the production of biofuels derived from food stock “a crime against humanity.”) Corn ethanol is also astonishingly inefficient: because vast amounts of fossil fuels are required for its manufacture, every 1 unit of energy nets a mere 1.3 units of ethanol.

2007-12-10,The Fatalist,"Malcolm Lowry wrote one great book; the rest was miscellany. Before we get to the (freshly collected) miscellany, a word about the one great book. Single-masterpiece authors tend to divide into two camps: the Eternals (Cervantes, Sterne, Melville), or the world-historical quacks who pack everything into a single, unyielding wallop; and the Eternal Adolescents (De Quincey, Kerouac, Exley), or burnout cases who pull it together to manufacture a cult classic. It was Lowry’s fate to fall right in between the two. Coming of age a half-generation after “Ulysses,” the British-born, Cambridge-educated Lowry wanted to produce not just a novel but a cosmos-surfing, cosmos-swallowing book of books. “Under the Volcano” takes place in a demi-Joycean 12 hours, on the feast of the Day of the Dead in Mexico, and took Lowry a Joycean 10 years to fully emit. No one would ever call it underdone. Following the last hours in the life of a British dipsomaniac, “Under the Volcano” embraces everything from Dante to Freud to the cabala. Here it shambles like Cervantes, there it rages like Ahab, and every page of it pulsates on Out of Body Auto-Reply, that style of pure Lowry that points at once backward, to all European literature, and forward, to the mother of all nervous breakdowns.

In the spring, a report by retired U.S. generals and admirals called on Washington to incorporate climate change, especially its destabilizing effect on weak states, into the United States’ national defense strategy. Soon after, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wrote in The Washington Post that the origin of the brutal fighting between herders and farmers in Darfur was an extended drought that was tied to the warming of the Indian Ocean  itself the product of new weather patterns driven by human activity. And then Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in part for his climate-change documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth.” What does global warming have to do with peace? In the view of the Nobel panel, it “may induce large scale migration and lead to greater competition for the Earth’s resources ...

2007-12-10,The Shock of the Old,"Napoleon’s occupation of Egypt in 1798 was among history’s more memorable military fiascos. A side skirmish in his drawn-out colonial competition with the British, by any measure the invasion went badly. The British promptly sank much of the French fleet, stranding the forces. A march across the desert from Alexandria to Cairo without so much as canteens, as Nina Burleigh tells us in “Mirage: Napoleon’s Scientists and the Unveiling of Egypt,” left “untold hundreds” dead. A Muslim uprising at Cairo resulted in more deaths and, not insignificantly, the loss of any remnant of civility on the part of the French who, invading the Azhar mosque in an effort to crush an insurgency, desecrated the Koran and, as an Egyptian contemporary wrote, “soiled the mosque, blowing their spit in it ... and defecating in it.” And then there was the plague, which, together with dysentery and other diseases, may have killed as many as 10,000 of the French soldiers.

He occasionally revealed himself to be, or to seem to be, an elitist, self-absorbed twit callously indifferent to the cares and woes of lesser mortals.

In fact, you are part of what Nixon aides used to call the “silent majority.” The security bureaucracy seems to think that as long as it is seen as doing something, and so long as another terror attack does not occur, the public will at least feel secure enough not to insist that it do whatever needs to be done actually to make us secure.Any number of examples could be cited to support this proposition, but let’s focus first on the foiled plot in the summer of 2006 to blow up several jetliners over the United States with liquid explosives. Because no technology had been developed to detect or thwart liquid explosives, the Transportation Security Administration was forced to take, for a time, the draconian step of banning all liquids and gels. We were told at the time that even liquids and gels that are harmless in and of themselves could become incendiary when combined in sufficient quantity.

I had brought together two separate worlds, friends and cousins, city and country people, and everyone got along and stayed until midnight. I cooked a fresh ham (thanks to James Beard, the calmest and funniest of authorities, I think), and my brother sent scallops from Nantucket, which I turned into a kind of pie. We had a potato gratin and a tossed salad. I dug out my mother’s recipe for chocolate pot de crème, and I used her old “Good Housekeeping Picture Cookbook” for the coconut layered cake. I cooked a batch of the Swedish ginger cookies, the ones made with bacon fat.

2007-12-11,OSHA Investigates Ballet Dancers Fall,"The Atlanta Ballet is under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor after a 17-year-old dancer wearing a panda costume fell about 12 feet into the orchestra pit last week during a performance of “The Nutcracker” at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The dancer, Leah Boresow, a high school senior, plunged into the empty orchestra pit and suffered serious injuries. She underwent spinal surgery on Wednesday and was reported to be in critical but stable condition at the Atlanta Medical Center, the Atlanta Ballet said in a statement. Andre Richards, director of the Atlanta West Office of OSHA, said, “Anytime we see a high-profile situation such as that, normally what we do is initiate an inspection.” He added, “We will probably take a look at the costume to see what level of vision that person had.” He said a week or two might pass before the inspector’s report would be available and any citations might be issued. Jeff Al-Mashat, a spokesman for the ballet, said precautions would be taken to keep the panda dancers safe for the remaining run of the ballet, continuing through Dec. 29. The Journal-Constitution reported that two days before her fall, Ms. Boresow told friends at Chattahoochee High School that she was concerned that she might fall off the stage because of the costume, which offered limited sight through a hole in the nose of the panda head.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/11/arts/dance/11arts-OSHAINVESTIG_BRF.html

Officials acknowledged that girl had been raped before, in 2002, when she was 7, by several juveniles who did not face court, in the Aboriginal community of Aurukun, where she lived. She was then sent to live with a non-indigenous foster family in Cairns before being returned to Aurukun in April 2006, where she was gang-raped a second time. One welfare officer responsible for sending the girl back has been fired and two others have been suspended, said the Queensland premier, Anna Maria Bligh. “The system clearly failed this little girl,” she said. Local reports said the state had asked the prosecutor in the gang rape case to stand aside after a court transcript disclosed that he had characterized it as “consensual sex.” Calls grew for the removal of Judge Bradley, who said the girl had “probably agreed” to sex.

ABC tied Fox for third over all, getting little help in the ratings from “October Road” at 10 (5.2 million) or from its 9 p.m. comedies, “Samantha Who?” (6.7 million) followed by “Notes From the Underbelly” (4.6 million).",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/arts/television/12arts-JOURNEYMANSC_BRF.html

2007-12-12,Stolen Statues Anger Indonesian Lawmaker,"More than 100 ancient artifacts, including ancestral statues, have been stolen from Central Sulawesi province in Indonesia and are being sold at galleries on Bali, an Indonesian legislator said on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reported. “These various artifacts have been stolen from the Lore Lindu plateau since 2000, and we have seen ourselves about 100 of them being offered for sale in galleries in Bali,” said Asmir Podungge, a lawmaker from the Poso district. “They were sold at high prices, including one stone ancestor statue known as Batu Nongko, which is said to have been sold for five billion rupiah,” or $537,000. Mr. Podungge said that the district parliament had alerted the local authorities but that “they seemed to not be too excited about this.” The Lore Lindu plateau holds many megalithic remains, including huge boulders carved into ancestral figures, stone burial jars, plates and game boards, whose origins remain unclear. Mr. Podungge’s complaints followed the arrest of four people on Java, Indonesia’s main island, in connection with the theft of five ancient statues from a museum in the historic city of Surakarta. A routine inspection of the Radya Pustaka museum found that the works had been stolen and replaced by fakes.

2007-12-12,Elliott Carter at 99,"Now here’s a way to celebrate your birthday: Gather hundreds of affectionate fans in a theater, sit as they watch a rare performance of your only opera and bathe in their applause.So it was for the Elliott Carter, who turned 99 on Tuesday and is one of the most eminent living composers. He was attending the final showing in a run of his opera “What Next?” The work, a sort of musical “Waiting for Godot” with six singers, was being staged for the first time in New York, Mr. Carter’s city of origin and his home for many years.The opera is just 40 minutes long, and occupied the second half of the program, which took place at the Miller Theater. The first half consisted of Carter chamber works, ranging from an unaccompanied violin solo to a six-member ensemble.At intermission, a stream of people came up to Mr. Carter, who was seated in an aisle seat in the third row. Many wished him a happy birthday. He signed a compact disc of his music. He accepted an organic chocolate bar from a female admirer, and took a bite. He greeted each person amiably, sometimes leaning forward to hear better.Seated around him were his friends and supporters in the music world, including the bass clarinetist Virgil Blackwell, a musical collaborator and close friend. Charles Rosen, the pianist and scholar who recently wrote about his connection to Mr. Carter in The New York Times, was there. So were other musical satraps, including Joseph Polisi, the president of the Juilliard School, and Ara Guzelimian, the school’s dean and a former administrator of Carnegie Hall.After the opera performance, the cast took its bows in a row on the stage. The conductor, Jeffrey Milarsky, a busy specialist in contemporary music, was up there too. Then he gestured for the audience to rise, which it did, and the whole house began singing “Happy Birthday” to Mr. Carter, who approached the stage, turned and waved to the audience and clapped one hand against the other, which was holding a cane. He had a big smile on his face. Many people cheered.",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/elliott-carter-at-99/

A month ago Washington had moved on to speculating about her running mate (my guess if she wins Iowa: Tom Vilsack); now she’s in a three-way tie in Iowa and losing her lead in New Hampshire faster than Mitt Romney changes positions. Is she seriously in danger of coming undone? Is she still in command of the race? There is an appropriately Clintonian way to answer these questions, which is yes to both.The first presidential campaign I covered was Bill Bradley’s 2000 run against Al Gore. (I met my wife on that campaign, so it wasn’t a total loss.) People forget this now, but there was a moment, at about this time in 1999, when Mr. Bradley came stunningly close to stealing the Democratic nomination. Mr. Gore was a sitting vice president, with all of the institutional support in the party, as well as the labor unions and the interest groups and the big-money bundlers and the bulletproof limo and, of course, the prosperity and relative peace of the Clinton years at his back. And yet here was Mr. Bradley, three years removed from his last public office, surging to a lead in New Hampshire and gaining so much ground in Iowa, a state in which he hadn’t even planned to compete, that his campaign decided to send dozens of staff there. (It was, in retrospect, a huge tactical blunder, but Iowa is like that, tantalizingly within reach one minute and 56,000 square miles of pure quicksand the next.) In those tense weeks, you could almost hear the monstrous machinery of the Democratic establishment squeak as it teetered away from Gore.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/clintons-gore-moment/

All those crisp, pleated shopping bags and the sense of having bought something special for someone, or at least having made a decision—it throbbed along the avenue. I was armed myself, with a large silvery white book, appropriately called “Be Dazzled! Norman Hartnell.” The 268-page book (Pointed Leaf Press) had come into my office, among others, and as I cracked it open, out came, it seemed, the froth of the British Empire. It’s a stunning book, full of information and surprise.

Cristián Samper, above, acting secretary of the Smithsonian, said $100 million is needed to repair the roof and other parts of that building, while another $100 million is needed to update and maintain its collection. Further, he said, about $400 million is needed for the planned National Museum of African American History and Culture. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate committee, said she and appropriations subcommittees are working toward creating a $45 million public and private matching program for maintenance and revitalization projects at the Smithsonian.

He had started under the tutelage of Lester Horton, a charismatic dance mentor in Los Angeles, where Ailey grew up. But Horton died, in 1953, too soon to give the would-be dancer much sense of continuity and tradition. Ailey left for New York in 1954 and never stopped, achieving what passes for acclaim in the humble world of dance. That was a burden he both accepted and felt oppressed by.

2007-12-13,Huckabee’s Compassionate Conservatism," The cover of the Times Magazine this Sunday is a profile of Mike Huckabee by Zev Chafets, a writer whose work I’ve always liked. It’s a great portrait, rendered skeptically but without cynicism, and I highly recommend it. What’s occurred to me as I’ve read stories about Mr. Huckabee over these last few months — I’ve not yet met him — is that you can already see how, should he manage to win the nomination, he would deftly steer himself back toward the political center in time for the convention. The outlines of the post-primary Huckabee storyline have already emerged: he raised some taxes over his own party’s objections, he refused to deny scholarships to illegal immigrants (a decision he has refused to back away from “even if it costs me he election”), he came off as too liberal and secular for a lot of his fellow Baptist preachers. These lines from the Huckabee resume have earned him the scorn of some Republican interest groups, most notably the anti-tax Club for Growth, whose idea of state government consists of a couple of prisons and a paving machine, but they would serve him nicely in a general election, where independent voters might shrink from electing another rigid conservative. Campaign reporters always line up to write stories like this, not because they care about making the Mike Huckabees of the world seem kind and gentle, which he may well be, but because we in the media are trained to look for the contradiction of stereotypes — and no one is more gleefully stereotyped in America than the religious conservative. Thus we in the media have historically embraced the story of the Republican governor who, it turns out, isn’t as much of a crazy conservative as you might think. Hey, look, the Tin Man has a heart! George W. Bush was a “compassionate conservative” who worked amiably across the aisle with Democrats. Mitt Romney passed a landmark, bipartisan bill to provide healthcare. Even Ronald Reagan enacted a huge tax increase while governor of California. And so on. ",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/huckabees-compassionate-conservatism/

2007-12-17,The Newest Mandarins,"Lei Bo is a philosophy graduate student in China whose faith is in history, and by habit he considers the world using the thousands of classical passages that live in his head. Three years ago he was studying in an empty room in the School of Management at his university in Beijing when students began to amble in for their class on Sun Tzu’s “Art of War,” a work from either the fifth or the fourth century B.C. Lei Bo decided to stay. He had taken two courses on “The Art of War” in the philosophy and the literature departments, and was curious to see how students in business and management might approach the same subject. The discussion that day was on the five attributes of a military commander. Sun Tzu said in the first chapter of the book, “An able commander is wise (zhi), trustworthy (xin), humane (ren), courageous (yong) and believes in strict discipline (yan).”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/magazine/16wwln-idealab-t.html

But really, what soul working in agricultural science today (or for that matter in any other field of endeavor) would stand up and be counted as against sustainability?

Terrorist movements require alienated individuals, a complicit community and a legitimizing ideology, Richardson argues; their troops are motivated by a desire for revenge, renown and reaction from the enemy. The Bush administration has given Al Qaeda the great renown and huge reaction it desires. A successful campaign against terrorism, like those in Peru, Turkey and Britain, she says, requires an effort led by police intelligence units and other arms of the states to isolate the terrorists by empowering nonviolent moderates.

In the Book Review, Marvin Kitman wrote about McGinniss: “His book is a 60-second commercial compared to Theodore White’s 90-minute special on the same subject, yet far more entertaining.” “The Selling of the President 1968” was the first of many of McGinniss’s books to appear on the Times best-seller list  including “Fatal Vision” (1983), “Blind Faith” (1989) and “The Last Brother” (1993), a biography of Ted Kennedy.

According to chronobiologists (that is, scientists who study the effects of time on life processes), most of us are mentally sharpest some three hours after waking, when concentration and problem-solving abilities may be up to 30 percent better than at other times of day. This makes late morning the best time to puzzle through a complex decision or absorb new information. The best time to brave the dentist’s chair, by contrast, is in the afternoon, when the pain threshold in teeth is highest. To set a personal speed record, try scheduling your run or swim for early evening, when your perception of exertion is low and your muscles are at their most powerful.

With ads asserting there was “self-respect in soap and water” and an aggressive school hygiene curriculum featuring a daily “Keep Clean” parade, the organization sought to convince Americans that they could never be too well-scrubbed. The institute was short-lived but helped give birth to the shelves of deodorants, soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, mouthwashes, teeth-whiteners, douches and antibacterial lotions that fill our pharmacy shelves today.

Sign up for daily news alerts about Guantánamo and you learn that the foreign papers regularly publish articles on hunger strikes, silent prisoner releases and legal wrangling at the camp. Major American papers rarely cover these things, and most of us would be hard pressed to name a detainee held there.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/books/review/Lithwick-t.html

The figure of “wodwo,” which Hughes elsewhere characterized as a sort of “half-man, half-animal spirit of the forests,” seemed to have loomed up out of the unconscious of English poetry. The book’s epigraph came from a ferocious passage in “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” and soon I was parsing the somewhat resistant Middle English text and bounding through J. R. R.

CBS averaged the most viewers for the night, although the network did rank second at 10 with its “Survivor: China” reunion special (12.2 million), which trailed NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” coverage. NBC and Fox shared second place for the night, but Fox led over all among the 18-to-49 set, largely because of an overrun of its afternoon football coverage, which delivered more than 21 million viewers as prime time began at 7 p.m. A new episode of “The Simpsons” (10.1 million) also put Fox on top at 8 p.m. among adults 18 to 49.

November witnessed extreme makeovers applied to two of the Sonoran Desert's ""must-play"" destinations, Troon North and the TPC Scottsdale. Troon North's tweaks are the more subtle. Its Saguaro-laced Monument and Pinnacle courses have been rated as Arizona's top two public-access tracks for than 10 years, but the layout routed players in confusing directions. After much soul-searching, Troon Golf executives split up the vaunted Monument layout, pairing its old back nine with the old back nine of the Pinnacle to form a ""new"" Pinnacle course. The ""new"" Monument course comprises the old front nines. Original designer Tom Weiskopf resurfaced the greens and reworked the bunkers to achieve a consistent look throughout. The result is better flow. Gone are the ""Where-in-the-world-am-I-going"" cart rides that slowed up play considerably. Monument is the more spectacular of the two, with gigantic rocks and elevation changes at every turn, but Pinnacle is tougher -- and, in a rarity for the desert, is a walkable course, even if its ninth hole doesn't return to the clubhouse.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/sports/playemail/1220playgolf.html

The exhibition, “From Russia: French and Russian Master Paintings 1870-1925,” was scheduled to open at the Royal Academy on Jan. 26. But Moscow refused to lend major French and Russian paintings out of concern that they might be held. (Above, Kuzma Petrov Vodkin’s 1912 work “Bathing of a Red Horse.”) Among the paintings to be shown were prominent Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, which descendants of some Russian collectors claim were taken by the new government after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. James Purnell, head of the British Culture Department, said on Thursday that Britain would move up, to early January from late February, the effective date of a provision in legislation that bars the seizure of art lent on a government-to-government basis. Natalia Uvarova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s federal culture agency, said that her office would issue licenses for the paintings only after the law takes effect, which means that the Russian works, now in Dusseldorf, Germany, will return to Moscow instead of continuing on to London, she said. It was up to the organizers of the London exhibition, Ms. Uvarova added, to decide whether the paintings could be shipped quickly enough for the show to open as scheduled on Jan. 26.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/arts/design/22arts-RUSSIATOLEND_BRF.html

2007-12-24,Letters: The Readers Speak,"Re “A Semi-Nude Minor? In The Times?” (Dec. 16): While I can appreciate the fact that T magazine might not have been the most appropriate venue for this photo editorial, it is interesting to see how it has been perceived by so many people.It is also fascinating that people think that they have the right to judge so severely and with such vengeance.Perhaps these are the same people who would not enter an art museum unless the statues were covered in drapes. In Europe, the pictures in question would never elicit the least bit of controversy.There is nothing “minor” about Ali. She is an old soul who is an extremely intelligent, focused, disciplined, responsible young lady. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. While she is a few months shy of her 18th birthday, she is more mature than most adults twice her age.She has had the good fortune to work with some of the world’s best-known photographers over the past two years, including Paolo Roversi. He is an icon in the fashion industry. While I am with Ali every step of the way, it is not up to me to choose which photographs are to be published. I do not have control over that decision-making process. That said, there is nothing remotely sexual or pornographic about the pictures in the T. In my eyes, they portray a sense of innocence and beauty.To those who have responded to your column by criticizing my daughter and me so vehemently: Please understand that I have my viewpoint, and you have yours. It is unacceptable for you to demand that we think exactly alike, and it is unconscionable that you feel the need to judge or attack while expressing your views. After all, we come from totally different backgrounds and perspectives and are each entitled to our opinions.Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. If you don’t like what you see, keep in mind that no one is forcing you to look. MaryAnn MichaelColleyville, Tex., Dec. 19, 2007 ● On the one hand, you’re right. I don’t read T. On the other hand, now that you bring it up, those photos of that 17-year-old model are not fit for a newspaper with general circulation.Exposing as much as possible of a minor’s body for commercial gain (but without getting arrested) is immoral, no matter how artful the photography.The Times can find some other way to sell its paper than exploiting even a willing minor whose parents care more about her career than about the character of our culture.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 “ ● Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine, justifies his decision to expose a youngster’s breast in a fashion spread by blurring the line separating commercial images from “art.”He acknowledges that “sexually charged” images sell products, so does he really suffer under the same illusion as the mother of the 17-year-old model, who found the layout to be “very artistic in nature”? Have we become so cynical that the currency of a young body can be peddled as “art” even in the most commercial of contexts?Rebecca ReichmannRancho Santa Fe, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● I guess I am glad I never buy the Sunday Times. It’s not so much that I disapprove of the T magazine section (I’ve never seen it, I think), but that I would resent paying for it and disposing of it greenly.I do buy and read the daily Times every day, and subscribe to the Book Review. Much of the reason I don’t buy the Sunday Times is that there is so much in it I really have no interest in.Emily Ann SchmalzerBrentwood, N.H., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Ordinarily I automatically dump T in the T-rash without even opening it, along with other glossy ads for things I’ll never need or want. But your column prodded me to have a look online at the 17-year-old model posing semi-nude.What a disappointment! She’s no Lolita, just an underweight kid posing in a grown-up’s overpriced duds. And that barely perceptible bare breast was so badly out of focus that it registered zero on both the photographic and sexuality meters.The only astonishing thing about the photos was the revelation that a $3,890 Galliano taffeta coat could be worn, as the caption states, as a skirt.No, these photos didn’t register as pornographic nor tawdry — nor even edgy. Aaron EpsteinWashington, Dec. 16, 2007 ● Can fashion photographs be “art”? The word was used by many cited in your column.I have just viewed the photos of Ali Michael. I find an unmistakable reference to Degas’ sculpture of the 14-year-old dancer in the focused photo with a taffeta coat: the tied hair, the arms straight behind the back, the use of material in an original way, not to mention the insecurity of youth bravely confronting the hostilities of the world, including that of sexual exploitation.The great difference for these two models is, of course, exposure. Degas’ model posed in private; the resulting sculpture became the vehicle of expression.Ms. Michael is viewed by millions and is herself, to a far greater extent, the vehicle of expression. Her body has, in a sense, been designed to meet certain criteria of the modeling circuit, achieving that white, emaciated, vulnerable look.My concern for Ms. Michael is that the look of breakable china may go deeper than art or artifice.John DannAmherst, Mass., Dec. 17, 2007The writer is a painter and sculptor. ● Gee whiz, the Gray Lady is getting frisky. The soul-searching regarding this issue stands in stark (sorry) contrast to the Mapplethorpe uproar several years ago.At that time, Cincinnati decided that his work would shock and offend the good citizens of Cincinnati. The Times scolded the Queen City for its provincial prudery, in articles and editorials. It’s art, not porn, it proclaimed.Maybe yes, maybe no — either way, has The Times yet published even one of the “offending” photos? I haven’t seen one.Yes, of course, there are certain standards and unwritten laws (mostly involving advertising revenue) that must be considered — or are there?Give us a break. The Times is way ahead of the field in bowdlerizing words and images, while preaching open-mindedness to the benighted citizenry. Lionel LibsonCamden, Me., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The bright line T magazine needs to find is not is not one that “separates sexually charged images of men and women just short of 18 from art,” as Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of the Magazine says, it is the bright line that separates pornography from child pornography. If the model is, or looks, under-age, The Times should do itself and the world a favor. Hire a grown-up. Then readers can decide for themselves whether it is too nasty to have in the house, and editors can decide whether it is too nasty to have in The New York Times.Kathleen A. PoolPortland, Ore., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The photographs are neither sexy nor tawdry. The model is indeed showing a lot of skin, but she is much too skinny.Yale RichmondWashington, Dec. 17, 2007 ● You are a brave man. In today’s culture, you could be accused of censorship, prudery, proselytizing … a whole host of rocks could be thrown your way. And probably will be. I hope you can duck.The quest for material gain should never intrude on values. Keep explaining this to Jim Schachter, Bill Keller and all those at The Times who don’t seem to understand this.Bill FabrizioEast Atlantic Beach, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Your column was much ado about nothing. After refreshing my memory with the pictures, I found the offending photo to be so indistinct as to be inoffensive and meaningless.The real issue was the exploitation of a minor in a semi-nude picture. This is the issue that you should have focused upon, not the poor-quality picture.Michael HermanNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Times risks losing its reputation by daring to see how far it can go in prurient appeal. If T magazine leads the way, can we expect its standards will show up in news sections? (News could serve up photos of the yearly naked run of students at Tufts, pictures of a bare breast at the Super Bowl halftime show.)If there are going to be double standards for sections of the paper, perhaps subscribers should be allowed to opt out of receiving T.S. E. SoderlindShort Hills, N.J., Dec. 16, 2007 ● I fear your column only stokes the fires of censorship by suggesting that art photography in The Times should be held to a different standard for good taste than that appearing in a specialist publication like V simply because The Times is sold to those who don’t seek or expect to find such images in their daily newspaper.This notion perpetuates America’s puritanical neurosis about the portrayal of the human form in any medium.While I found T’s photos (and most fashion or lifestyle photography today) to be silly, incomprehensible and pointless, I have no objection to it being offered up to those readers and advertisers willing to pay the big bucks to keep The Times and the industry for luxury products afloat.It would be far more objectionable for The Times to censor creative people who are exploring the edge of good taste to avoid offending a moralistic minority. Those people have nothing better to do than tell everyone else how to live their lives, and they won’t be satisfied no matter what you do.Whether the subject is fashion photography or news reportage, most thinking people can decide for themselves what content they want to see in their daily reading. P. Douglas FolkPhoenix, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Holiday 2007 T magazine was very disturbing to me. After glancing through it and seeing the article with the young teenager, I was disconcerted by what I considered a step beyond art, pushing the images to a questionable level of good taste.Frankly, the entire issue left a stressed-out, overly commercial, lacking-in-substance impression. If I wished to read this type of magazine, I would buy it. Unfortunately, the past and present issue of T land in my waste basket often with but a glance.It is very revealing when the top editors have become inured to what that “edge” means to those of us who are not Seventh Avenue-hardened. The cult of the skinny anorexic models has gone too far. If you’ve ever known a young person who suffers this life-threatening state, it is neither attractive nor appealing.Ruth Mary PollackGuilford, Conn., Dec. 16, 2007 ● While neither tawdry or pornographic, as you say, the pictures you refer to probably startled quite a few readers, coming as they did in their Sunday morning paper.I do question the contention that content in T pushes limits that the regular paper does not. I recall seeing a photograph accompanying a review of the play “Lulu” in the Nov. 29 Arts pages. The picture was a highly sexualized young lady (probably not a teen, though, and I recognize that this likely changes the conversation), sitting with her legs spread around a seated man whose pants are around his ankles.I don’t point this out to criticize any of the pictures I’ve seen in The Times. I am far more inclined to take umbrage at a smug-looking Dick Cheney on Page 1 than any mildly erotic image within separate sections of the paper. I only wish to demonstrate that this sort of eroticism may be more prevalent in your paper than you might think. Ralph W. SiddallDes Moines, Dec. 16, 2007 ● My children are children no longer. I am more liberal than most, with a particularly strong perspective on censorship, but it is neither the parent nor the political animal in me that is concerned to see these pictures in a Times publication.No matter how seriously editors make decisions when skating the edge of child pornography, they are already over the edge in my book.The Times’s willingness to exploit this edge pushes me toward The Wall Street Journal. It’s easier to sort out that publication’s bias than to trust a company that would skim this edge. By sexualizing childhood for the sake of sales, The Times positions itself among a new batch of competitors.Longtime readers want The Times to move with the times, but this move reads as a sign that the Times may be morphing into something unrecognizable to this reader.Pamela MilesNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● I looked at the pictures on the Web site. Although, as Ali Michael’s mother said, she may be “very modest,” her garb and poses cross my line of what we used to call decency.My mother always demanded of me and my siblings that we do nothing in public that we would not do at home. That’s my line, and in my opinion, Ms. Michael crossed it.The Times should not have printed the pictures, regardless of the age of the model.Bill AbbottSaratoga, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● That glossy magazine The Times throws at us 15 times a year is not part of the “culture.” That’s just an excuse to make more money for The Times.What happened to the wonderful magazine The Times used to give us at holiday time, showing New Yorkers and visitors the maps of the city and where each great holiday happening would be?Get back to basics and stop the stupid designer nonsense I throw in the garbage. And no more of these “culture” excuses.Estelle BrunoWest Sayville, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Had I been a responsible editor asked to decide on those photographs, I would have nixed them. But not so much for the sexual suggestiveness as to avoid rewarding the physical child abuse of which they appear to be incontrovertible proof.As my wife instantly observed when I sought her opinion, that poor girl looks starved. The only visible curve on her is the profile of her breast. If she’s not anorexic or bulemic, then she is suffering from something else that also needs urgent medical attention.Isn’t the “fashion” industry belatedly recognizing this problem? Should The Times, or any newspaper, be part of the solution instead of the problem?Martin A. DyckmanWaynesville, N.C., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Those critics have too much time and too little do. Pornography is in the mind of the beholder. They must have filthy minds.Peter J. PeiranoRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 17, 2007●●Re “If It’s Fit to Blog, Is It Fit to Print?” (Dec. 9):It may have been the correct decision to keep from the printed version of The Times the quote from the book by Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, that suggested President Bush had lied to him since Mr. McClellan had already said to Larry King on CNN that he didn’t think Mr. Bush had knowingly pressed him to divulge false information.All the fuss over Mr. Bush seems to have eclipsed the fact that Mr. McClellan’s statement also included Vice President Dick Cheney, Andrew Card, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.They were not similarly excused by Mr. McClellan on “Larry King Live.” How about mentioning that in the printed version of The New York Times? And how about a follow-up investigation of the fabulating four by Times reporters?James D. PoissonWakefield, R.I., Dec. 9, 2007 ● Your analysis of the excerpt from Scott McClellan’s not-yet-released book about the leak that led to Scooter Libby’s conviction raised compelling journalistic issues. But it glossed right over the substantive issue, arguing that the president may not have been one of the five who knew that Mr. McClellan was being asked to lie to the public and that therefore the leak story didn’t go to print.Wouldn’t the story of the president and his press secretary being lied to by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney and the president’s own chief of staff be front-page news?Mary E. FellowsPortland, Ore., Dec. 10, 2007●I have written in before to complain about The Times Magazine’s use of veryyoung-looking models. This may be the first actual breast, but spreadsfeaturing heavily made-up girls who look 12 or 14, sprawled in provocative,slutty poses are a standard feature of T ­ thumb through some back issues.I’m a Times subscriber in Tucson, and from here, obviously, the standardsof the New York fashion world (not to say the fashions themselves) arefairly incomprehensible. I take The Times to feel as if I know what’sreally going on, and despite some disappointments in the tone andindependence of the coverage, I love the paper and depend upon it. But thisold-hippie, staunchly anticensorship liberal is honestly shocked by theeditors’ lack of attention to the demi-child-porn in some of your fashionlayouts.If the Times lets fashion photographers, under-age models and their stagemothers decide what’s within the bounds of good taste, readers willcontinue to complain and editors will continue to have to explain howimages to delight pedophiles got into their newspaper.Renee DowningTucson, Dec. 16, 2007",Opinion,https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/letters-the-readers-speak-3/

2007-12-24,The African Front,"One hot, cloudless afternoon in October, I sat in the members’ salon of the Kenyan Parliament as the guest of Joseph Lekuton, an M.P. from the desolate bush country to the east of Lake Turkana. Around us a dozen other Kenyan politicians sat in comfortable armchairs, sipping tea from silver services and gliding from English to Swahili to tribal languages and back again. The décor  dark wood paneling, white concrete pillars and a flying-saucer-like brass-and-steel chandelier  suggested both the Soviet Politburo and a Las Vegas lounge in the Rat Pack era. Lekuton (pronounced LEH-koo-tone), an animated man in his late 30s, had dropped by to catch up on developments in the country’s election campaign. On Dec. 27, Kenyans are voting, for the first time since 2002, to choose a new president and Parliament; Lekuton was in the capital raising money and trying to decide whether to throw his lot in with the government coalition or with the main opposition party. (Kenya’s parties are fluid, and continuous maneuvering takes place during a campaign season.) Lekuton, a rising political star, was being wooed by both sides, which put his constituents in a state of considerable anxiety. The election, meanwhile, was promising to be the most democratic and unpredictable in Kenya’s history: polls showed President Mwai Kibaki slipping behind the challenger, Raila Odinga, a former political prisoner. The prospect of an incumbent president caught in a genuine electoral contest  a nearly unprecedented event in Africa  excited Lekuton. “There’s never been anything like this in Kenyan politics,” he told me.

It is puzzling, however, that Appiah explicitly demurs from the claim that the contributions of the x-phi movement have anything essential to do with the experiments. Those who know the old joke about the man who ordered a cherry soda, “hold the cherry syrup,” may have suffered a bout of déjà vu while reading Appiah’s remarks. For if the “best work in experimental philosophy would be valuable and suggestive even if it skipped the actual experiments,” then the best work in experimental philosophy is actually just the philosophy.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/magazine/23letters-t-002.html

2007-12-24,Inside the List,"DARK MATTER: The British writer Philip Pullman isn’t exactly a come-from-nowhere phenomenon  his giddy fantasy series “His Dark Materials” has sold millions of copies worldwide and garnered praise from critics for years. In 2002, Margo Jefferson rhapsodized about the series in an essay for The Times, headlined “Harry Potter for Grown-Ups”: “War, politics, magic, science, individual lives and cosmic destinies are all here. They are not flung together, they are shaped and assembled into a narrative of tremendous pace by a man with a generous, precise intelligence.” Similarly, when Christopher Hitchens reviewed the final Harry Potter book for us this summer, he urged bereft muggles to “graduate” to Pullman. But the books didn’t crack our best-seller list until last week, when they finally landed on the children’s series list at No. 4, thanks to the movie version of “The Golden Compass,” the first novel in the trilogy. Critical acclaim is nice and all, but when it comes to selling books in America, a few things are evidently nicer: Nicole Kidman’s face, a Hollywood marketing budget and a healthy dollop of religious controversy. This week, “His Dark Materials” jumps to No. 1 on the series list. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/books/review/23tbr.html

His flat was in a spanking new and bright red-brick building, with an elevator! He had been ill, and the elevator was a wonderful innovation. He who had thought nothing of twenty-mile walks had even allowed little Noakes to push him along the Embankment in a Bath chair, enjoying the sense of space and of passersby, a delicious mixture of privacy and publicity. The flat's windows looked southward over the treetops on the Embankment to the river that flowed past with massive opacity.

The original post also repeated a string of assertions by Bill White, the commander of the American National Socialist Workers Party, including the allegation that Paul meets regularly “with members of the Stormfront set, American Renaissance, the Institute for Historic Review and others” at a restaurant in Arlington, Va. Paul never attended these dinners, according to Benton, who also says that Paul has never knowingly met Bill White. Norman Singleton, a congressional aide in Paul’s office, says that he met Bill White at a dinner gathering of conservatives several years ago, after which Singleton expressed his indignation at the views espoused by White to the organizer of the dinner.

On Dec. 17 security guards chased away two people who were using a blowtorch to try to cut through a back door. The second incident was not reported to the police. Last week’s theft, carried out in three minutes, has led to calls for the Brazilian government to take control of the museum, which lacks an alarm system and where the collection, valued at more than $1 billion, is uninsured. The stolen Picasso is said to be valued at $50 million. “It’s appalling that anyone with half a brain would be able to walk into one of Latin America’s most important museums and steal a Picasso,” said Jones Bergamin, who runs the auction house Art Bourse in Rio de Janeiro. “The guardians of art in Brazil nearly invited these thieves to rob them.” Jose do Nascimento Jr., director of museums at the Institute of Heritage and National Arts in Brazil, said the country had the world’s fourth-highest number of art thefts, after the United States, France and Iraq.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/arts/27arts-DIDARTTHIEVE_BRF.html

2007-12-31,More Questions for the Smithsonian," W. Richard West Jr., below, the founding director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, spent a quarter of a million dollars of institution money on transportation and hotels over four years, the Smithsonian confirmed on Friday. The money was spent on more than 500 days of travel between 2003 and 2007. The dozens of trips, first reported in The Washington Post on Friday, took him to Europe, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore and a number of other destinations for speaking engagements, work for other nonprofit organizations and fund-raisers. Linda St. John, a Smithsonian spokeswoman, said that all Mr. West’s travel was approved. “He brought in $51 million in fund-raising” during that period, she said. “While it may seem shocking that he spent $250,000 on travel, realize what the trade-off is and what he gave to the Smithsonian and Native Americans."" Mr. West, in a telephone interview, said, “The fact is that the strategic aims of the Museum of the American Indian required that I had these connections to the international community."" Mr. West, 64, a lawyer and historian who is a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, oversaw the opening of the museum on the National Mall in 2004, as well as the creation of the George Gustav Heye Center for the museum in New York and the Cultural Resources Center in Suitland, Md. He recently retired as director, but remains on the payroll until the end of the year. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said she had asked for an accounting of Mr. West’s activities from the Smithsonian’s board of regents, as well as from the Government Accountability Office. Smithsonian officials have been under scrutiny since spending abuses by the institution’s secretary, Lawrence M. Small, came to light this year. Mr. Small resigned in March; Sheila Burke, his deputy, did so in September.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/arts/29arts-MOREQUESTION_BRF.html

Mexican archaeologists found the ruins, which are about 36 feet high, in the central Tlatelolco area, once a religious and political center for the Aztec elite. Since the discovery of another pyramid at the site 15 years ago, historians have thought Tlatelolco was founded by the Aztecs in 1325, the same year as the nearby twin city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of their empire, which the Spanish razed in 1521. The pyramid, found last month, may have been built as early as 1100, signaling that the Aztecs began to develop their civilization in central Mexico earlier than believed. “The timeline is going to need to be revised,"" the archaeologist Patricia Ledesma said. In August archaeologists in the city’s Iztapalapa district unearthed what they say may be the main pyramid of Tenochtitlan.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/arts/29arts-AZTECPYRAMID_BRF.html

2007-12-31,Ruling on Nazi Art,"A federal judge has ruled that a painting held by a German baroness belongs to the estate of a Jewish art dealer who was forced by the Nazis to auction it, The Associated Press reported. Chief Judge Mary M. Lisi of United States District Court for Rhode Island on Thursday ordered Maria-Luise Bissonnette to turn over “Girl From the Sabiner Mountains,"" above, to representatives of the estate of Max Stern, who died in 1987, stating that his “relinquishment of his property” was clearly “anything but voluntary."" Both sides say that the painting, which has not been authenticated, is by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, a 19th-century artist famous for his portraits of European nobility. One appraiser for Ms. Bissonnette estimated its value at up to $94,000. Mr. Stern inherited his family’s art gallery in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1934, but three years later the Nazis forced him to auction its contents because he was Jewish. He later fled to Canada, where he became a prominent art dealer and worked to reclaim his lost paintings. Ms. Bissonnette’s stepfather, Karl Wilharm, a member of the Nazi Party, purchased the painting at the auction; Ms. Bissonnette, who resettled in Rhode Island, inherited it. Mr. Stern left his estate to the McGill and Concordia Universities in Montreal and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, which have continued his work in trying to find his paintings, hundreds of which are still missing. Ms. Bissonnette has said that she and her family did nothing wrong. “I have the receipt,” she said earlier. “My father paid for it.""",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/arts/29arts-RULINGONNAZI_BRF.html

2007-12-31,Week 17 in Preview: Redskins Control Their Playoff Destiny,"The Washington Redskins can earn a playoff berth by beating the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. But like several other matchups on the final day of the regular season, the outcome will hinge as much on who does not play as on who does.The Cowboys (13-2) clinched home field in the National Football Conference playoffs last Sunday. They have little to gain by going all out against Washington (8-7) and will probably limit the risk to injured players like Tony Romo (thumb).One player who will not be taking part is Terrell Owens, who sustained a high ankle sprain last week. Owens scored all four touchdowns in the Cowboys’ Week 11 victory against the Redskins (highlights here), taking advantage of a secondary weakened by the absence of safety Sean Taylor. Taylor, who missed the game with a knee injury, was shot and killed a week later. His death, and a season-ending injury to quarterback Jason Campbell, might have led the Redskins to pack it in.Instead, they won three in a row. Now, buoyed by the steady play of Todd Collins, who has not thrown an interception, and Clinton Portis, who has 376 yards from scrimmage in the last three games, the Redskins control their playoff destiny.“I don’t know of a team — I haven’t been a part of one — that’s overcome this much,” Coach Joe Gibbs told reporters. “It’s almost like they’re going to overcome whatever’s out there.”",Sports,https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/week-17-in-preview-redskins-control-their-playoff-destiny/

2007-12-31,A Neurotic’s Neurotic,"GIVEN THAT WORDS are the bread and butter of psychoanalytic work, it would seem strange on the face of it that very few practitioners have written elegant or even lucid prose. Indeed, they amount to no more than a handful: Freud himself; his daughter, Anna; the British analyst D. W. Winnicott; the much-neglected Leslie Farber; Robert Stoller; Irvin Yalom; Adam Phillips. The field, suffering as it does from an inferiority complex about its relevance to the larger culture, has immured itself behind the high walls of jargon  terms like “introjective identification,” “countercathexis” and “unintegrated superego nuclei.” This emphasis on opacity is in part an effort to preserve psychoanalysis’s waning mystique. Paradoxically, it also underscores the discipline’s attempt to validate its much-disputed conjectures about human behavior by appropriating the clinical vocabulary of hard science. Yet for those of us who remain interested in what the talking cure may have to offer (the number dwindles almost daily), the lack of an accessible dialogue between clergy and laity remains a woeful reality.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/magazine/30wheelis-t.html

Gloria Connors already had one son, and with another boy on the way, she wanted to build a tennis court on her property. People in East St. Louis didn’t have tennis courts in their backyards. It was, that second son, Jimmy Connors, told me, “the other side,” a blue-collar town of stockyards, factories and railroad tracks across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, but Gloria had been an accomplished professional who had played well at the U.S. national championships at Forest Hills in the 1940s and once reportedly thrashed the youthful Olympian Babe Didrikson in a challenge match, and she already had a feeling about her sport and Jimmy. The construction men obliged her with their graders and steamrollers; Gloria laid out the court and then took up her garden tools. “She made everything possible for me,” Connors says. He feels that way because Jimmy Connors, one of the finest, fiercest tennis players ever, is the only leading man to have been coached throughout his career by a woman  a mother so dedicated that she was preparing to teach him even before he was born.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/magazine/30Connors-t.html

2007-12-31,Mr. Reassurance,"During the war years of the ’40s, the uncomplicatedness of certain actors made them useful. Nobody wanted to watch a neurotic or a sexual malingerer at the heart of a flag-waver. Barry Nelson, 23 years old and blessed with a three-dimensional Archie comic of a face, got the money lines in the 1943 movie “The Human Comedy”: “I guess you don’t really understand your country until it’s in trouble,” he says, sitting in a movie theater with a couple of other G.I.’s. They’re watching a newsreel in which a literally waving flag is superimposed onto the face of F.D.R. “All the rest of the time you take it for granted. Like your family.” Sitting near Barry Nelson, a startlingly young-looking Robert Mitchum seems as if he can’t wait to lead the postwar charge that would soon land the neurotics and the malingerers in the power seats. By the time the second wave of that charge hit  with the advent of Brando, Clift and Dean  Barry Nelson’s regular-guy persona was no longer so useful in Hollywood.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/magazine/30nelson-t.html

2007-12-31,The Spy in the Gray Flannel Suit,"In the first third of this beautiful new novel, we follow young Mark Ruttenberg, an ordinary spy, through the final stages of his training in Virginia and his initial posting overseas. The book is fiction packaged as mock memoir, the story told in Ruttenberg’s distinctive voice: operationally plain, detailed but distanced, present but not always there. The voice is born of the case reports officers like Ruttenberg must generate to document their every move. He describes the traffic on the sidewalks, the buildings and the weather, the e-mail messages and the meetings. As a C/O, or case officer, Ruttenberg is trained to scan the streets behind his car for potential tails, and the faces at a party for potential recruits (known as “developmentals”). Restlessly and endlessly he scans. Slowly  indeed, it feels almost accidental  his scan begins to register not just the tactical facts of tail or no tail, but also the poverty and misery of his fellow man in the unnamed police state where he serves. He begins to track his own reactions and attractions. Bit by bit, a queasy truth takes hold. The book, though serious and strong, is not a novel in the normal sense. It is, rather, itself an act of espionage, the collected field reports of Ruttenberg meticulously spying on himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/books/review/Costello-t.html

The baffled reader, upon recovering, asked what was the matter with calling him an S.O.B. “But you called me a Republican S.O.B.,” Prickett answered  and thereby hangs the tale of why Harry Shuler Dent is such an important figure in American history. He was the behind-the-scenes player who did the most to turn the South from a region that despised Republicans into a Republican bastion.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/magazine/30DENT-t.html

I remember my own edition as small enough to hide  not that I really needed to  but packed with dynamite. It had a lurid cover illustration showing a barbed fishhook buried in a gleaming apple.

The most famous spot for speechifying was the “Speakers’ Corner” outside Lewis Michaux’s bookstore on 125th Street, where Malcolm X delivered his lectures on race and politics. On weekends or after work, fathers took their boys down to the corners in Harlem to watch any number of would-be firebrands engaged in emotional debate over Vietnam or the state of race relations or Bobby Kennedy’s political future.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/magazine/30gilliard-t.html

2007-12-31,The Lives They Lived,"Welcome to the 14th annual Lives They Lived issue. On the last Sunday of each year, we fill these pages with stories of all kinds of people who have died during the last 12 months. It is a daunting task: this newspaper alone published more than 1,000 obituaries, and those only touch on the vast number of notable deaths. In putting together this issue, we shy away from any attempt at being definitive; instead we embrace idiosyncrasy, storytelling and the interests and passions of our editors and writers. This year brought the deaths of many giants of politics and culture, from Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. to Luciano Pavarotti, from Brooke Astor to Ike Turner, from Lady Bird Johnson to Jack Valenti. But we present some of the lesser-known lives: Harry Dent, who quietly consolidated the South for the Republican Party; Andrée de Jongh, who, at 24, courageously escorted more than 100 soldiers and civilians out of Nazi-occupied Belgium to safety; Gloria Connors, who taught her son Jimmy how to be an unrelenting champion; Ernest Withers, who, as a black photographer, was able to document the civil rights movement from inside.

It’s this beautiful glossy book with all kinds of beautiful illustrations and all sorts of information about the process and art of knitting.” James Patterson told us: “I am absolutely devoted to giving my son books for Christmas. This year he will be receiving ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’” Mitch Albom said he’s giving “Tony Bennett in the Studio: A Life of Art and Music,” by Tony Bennett with Robert Sullivan. “Tony is a national treasure, and my friend, and giving this book is like giving an autobiography, a record collection and a tabletop art gallery all at once.” Dean Koontz said: “I am giving two-book sets of ‘A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900,’ by Andrew Roberts, and ‘Lone Survivor,’ by Marcus Luttrell with Patrick Robinson. In vigorous, pellucid prose, Roberts writes history with attitude and well-argued conviction. Luttrell and the Navy Seals of whom he writes are the embodiments of the ideals and the valor central to the culture chronicled in Roberts’s work.” And Nicholas Sparks told us: “I’m giving ‘The Afghan Campaign,’ by Steven Pressfield, to half a dozen people, and certainly to those who loved Pressfield’s earlier novel ‘Gates of Fire.’ It’s a marvelous story, wondrously told, a novel that keeps the pages turning, the readers guessing, and makes one feel as if they, too, were in the army, marching with Alexander the Great.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/books/review/30tbr.html

2007-12-31,Strong Opinions,"“Diary of a Bad Year” is not the first among J. M. Coetzee works of fiction to force readers to consider the friable boundary between fiction and nonfiction. “Elizabeth Costello” reveals its eponymous heroine, a literary celebrity, through a series of lectures given by Costello, their content familiar from essays published previously  by J. M. Coetzee. Thus instructed to conflate Costello with her creator, Coetzee’s readers encounter her again, in his following novel, “Slow Man,” which finds Costello taking up residence in the home of the protagonist, Paul Rayment, as he examines his life in the wake of a crippling accident. “Like it or not, I will be with you a while yet,” Costello informs her reluctant host. She’s brought a “hefty typescript” with her, and it appears she is the author of Paul’s fate, nudging him toward fulfillment. Or is she a product of his imagination? Certain of Costello’s exasperated comments to Paul  “I did not ask for you”  imply she has no more control over their peculiar pairing than does he. “Diary of a Bad Year” forgoes the conceit of a perfunctorily named and differentiated alter ego by following the late career of Señor C, who, like Coetzee, is a South African writer transplanted to Australia and the author of a novel titled “Waiting for the Barbarians.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/books/review/Harrison-t.html

Coetzee, she wrote in an e-mail message, “is never sentimental, and he pushes his characters right up against the problem of mortality and the inescapable cruelty of life. It’s not so much that he doesn’t spare the reader from pain as that he doesn’t spare himself. And then there’s the writing, which is clean and stark, beautiful as the desert is beautiful, an ecosystem in which nothing is wasted. Coetzee understands that a writer’s restraint is the catalyst for a reader’s emotional response, and his sentences feel less written than rendered, subjected to a heat or pressure that removes all but the essential.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/books/review/Upfront-t.html

I had once kicked her little dog when it attempted to bite me as I came up the front steps, and for this she took to tormenting me whenever she could. She would rise early and shuffle past my bedroom window in her heavy leather slippers, speaking baby talk to her small dog or singing loudly, making as much noise as possible in order to interrupt my sleep. She broke flowers off their stems, left bits of paper scattered in my garden. Sometimes when my husband and I returned home, she would be waiting for us and lean out her window and call out in a high, shrill voice, ""It's the intelligentsia — the intelligentsia has returned!"" She divided the word intelligentsia into separate syllables, flinging each one down at us as we hurried to open our door. Only in L.A., I thought, could someone make this word sound like a term of such utter derision. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/books/chapters/1st-chapter-the-long-embrace.html

2007-12-31,Whose Interests Are Special?," Barack Obama has always excited big Labor and other Democratic constituencies, even if they weren’t necessarily ready to endorse him for the presidency. Now, though, as Mr. Obama goes all out to undermine a surging John Edwards in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, that cordial relationship is being put to the test. Mr. Obama has essentially charged that Mr. Edwards is a hypocrite because, while Mr. Edwards has said he favors banning unregulated campaign money from outside groups, his campaign is getting millions of dollars worth of assistance from outside contributors — namely unions. What’s remarkable about this line of attack is that, while Mr. Obama is aiming squarely at Mr. Edwards, he also risks alienating some of the most powerful interest groups in Democratic Washington. In case you haven’t been paying attention, here’s what’s going on: several state chapters of the mighty Service Employees International Union have endorsed Mr. Edwards and set up an independent entity — the kind of so-called 527 that Edwards himself has decried in the past — to run ads on his behalf. They even hired his 2004 campaign manager, Nick Baldick, to oversee the operation. (The state and municipal workers union and Emily’s List are also in Iowa, dropping a lot of cash in support of Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Obama, the only one of the three leading candidates who hasn’t received a big union endorsement, has repeatedly called on Mr. Edwards to ask his labor friends to stand down. Mr. Edwards has responded by saying that he still opposes such groups in theory, but that he isn’t involved in the union effort and is powerless to control it.",U.S.,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/whos-interests-are-special/
