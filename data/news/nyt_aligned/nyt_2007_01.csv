2007-01-02,Playbook Full of Tricks Gives Boise State Dramatic and Defining Victory,"GLENDALE, Ariz., Monday, Jan. 2 — After a hook-and-lateral, a Statue of Liberty play and a halfback toss launched the Boise State football team to an upset that will long resonate in college football lore, the star tailback Ian Johnson might have saved the night’s most memorable surprise for the postgame interview. With the national television cameras focused on him after the chaos of Boise State’s 43-42 overtime victory over Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, Johnson proposed to his girlfriend, the Boise State cheerleader Christine Barbara Popadics. Popadics was so stunned and thrilled that she could barely speak. Just like everyone else watching. “She had no idea it was coming,” Johnson said. Neither did Oklahoma. Johnson’s proposal capped a dizzying, riveting, back-and-forth game that will be remembered as one of the most exciting in college football history. Boise squandered an 18-point second-half lead, tied the score with seven seconds remaining on a hook-and-lateral play, then used two more trick plays in overtime to cap a perfect 13-0 season. (Ohio State is the only other undefeated team.) “This probably goes down in the history of college football,” Boise quarterback Jared Zabransky said. “It can be argued as the best game ever.” The lasting memory of the game will most likely be the combination of three crazy trick plays — called Statue, Toss Halfback Pass and Circus. But the lasting effect — with a team that plays on blue turf competing against one of college football’s bluebloods — may be the removal of doubt about whether teams from smaller conferences can beat champions of the six major conferences. No one can doubt the daring of Boise’s play-calling. On the final play, Broncos Coach Chris Petersen decided to leave his offense on the field for a 2-point conversion attempt after Boise matched Oklahoma’s touchdown to open overtime. The call was for “Statue,” in which Boise lines up with three wide receivers stacked on the right side. The real guts by Petersen and Bryan Harsin, Boise’s 30-year old offensive coordinator, may have come with sticking with the play after Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops called a timeout. Boise went with the same look, with the stacked right side, showing a formation from which they often throw a wide receiver screen. Instead, Zabransky faked a screen pass to Legedu Naanee on his right, then hid the ball behind his back with his left hand. Johnson never moved, staying frozen until the fake was properly sold. Johnson then broke left against the grain of play, grabbed the ball from behind Zabransky’s back and strolled untouched around the left side into the end zone. The final 2 yards of his 101-yard night will forever be remembered in Boise history. The 2-point conversion made it 43-42 and set off a wild celebration on the Boise sideline and in the stands, where a majority of the 73,719 fans were decked out in Bronco blue and orange. “We needed a play like that to get it over with,” Petersen said after the game with a smile. But the two plays that got them there may have been even more creative. After Oklahoma tailback Adrian Peterson took the first play of overtime 25 yards for a touchdown, Boise needed to convert on a fourth-and-2 from the 5-yard line. Things got crazy, though, when Zabransky left his usual spot under center and broke in motion to the left. Vinny Perretta, a tailback who hadn’t thrown a pass all year, then lined up under center and threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Derek Schouman. That call was for “Toss Halfback Pass,” and it was the first time Boise had run it in a game this season. “We’ve been practicing it for the past month or so, and it couldn’t have worked out any better,” said Schouman, who also caught a 10-yard pass on third-and-8 to extend the overtime drive. Just to get to overtime, though, Boise pulled off perhaps the grandest of its three trick plays. On fourth-and-18 play from midfield, the Broncos called a hook-and-lateral play, “Circus.” They think so little of it that they hadn’t run it in a game or practice all season. They only did it while goofing off during informal Friday walk-through sessions. And even then it didn’t really work. “Usually we just run it when we’re joking around,” Schouman said. “I never thought that we’d actually run it, never mind for a touchdown.” Boise lined up with three wide receivers to the right and Drisan James alone on the left. James caught the ball about 12 yards from the line of scrimmage, with the defense playing soft to prevent him from getting a first down. The key to the play was James’s ability to fake that he was going to try and run for a first down. He tucked the ball and ran about 4 yards, which drew all the Oklahoma defenders toward him. Then he pitched the ball 4 yards behind him to Jerard Rabb, who had run over from the cluster of receivers on the other side of the field. “I didn’t even want to look after I pitched it,” James said. But the pitch went seamlessly, and Rabb knew almost instantly that James had executed the perfect fake. “When he caught it, he sucked the defensive backs, safeties and corners, they all came straight to him,” Rabb said. “He held it just long enough for me to escape around the side. “As soon as I got the ball and took about two steps, I was gone. Other than the time I was getting chased by a pit bull, it was the fastest I’ve run in my life.” Rabb’s mad dash to force overtime with seven seconds left also chased away some of Boise’s demons. Thanks to Paul Thompson’s four turnovers, which included a pick-six by Boise defensive back Marty Tadman and a fumble deep in Oklahoma territory, Boise was able to build a 28-10 third-quarter lead. But Oklahoma gutted its way back into the game, and scored two touchdowns in the final 90 seconds of regulation to go ahead. The first score came on a 5-yard pass from Thompson to Quentin Chaney to cut the Boise lead to 28-26. The drama came on the 2-point conversion; Oklahoma attempted it three times, thanks to a pass-interference call on Boise and a pre-snap motion penalty on the Sooners. On the third play, Thompson found Jauquin Iglesias in the end zone to tie the score at 28-28. Oklahoma cornerback Marcus Walker then seemingly decided matters when he returned an interception 33 yards for a touchdown with 1:02 remaining. “The game isn’t over until the clock hits zero,” Walker said in a stunned Oklahoma locker room. Many players wept openly. “But you would think the game is over then, right?” By then, it had only just begun. And on a deeper level, the Broncos were able to legitimize the very game that they were permitted to play. For the first time this season, there are five B.C.S. games this season instead of four because the smaller conferences fought hard for access to the B.C.S. and won. In one surreal night, the long battle spearheaded by Tulane’s president, Scott Cowan, seemed worthwhile. “The gap is decreasing fast,” Johnson said. “The smaller schools are going to start getting recognition now. Just because we haven’t been around forever doesn’t mean we don’t play great football.” Johnson and his teammates showed the college football establishment they have a few tricks up their sleeves. And if you don’t believe him, just ask a certain Boise State cheerleader. ",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/sports/ncaafootball/02fiesta.html

Now it seems that even this comfort will be denied. Far from healing old wounds, as some suggested it would, his conviction by the Iraqi special tribunal has exerted little effect on the deepening civil conflict between Shiites and Sunnis. The often circuslike atmosphere of the trial, as well as the murder of three defense lawyers, led groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the tribunal as flawed and illegitimate. And the charge for which Saddam Hussein received the death penalty did not include his most heinous acts. His execution must still remind the world of the horror of the atrocities he committed while in power. But unfortunately, the disarray of the legal process calls greater attention to the failings of the United States, the Iraqis and the international community in dealing with all that has come after.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/magazine/07wwln_lede.html

2007-01-08,Living With Fidel,"Within the revolution, everything; outside the revolution, nothing,” has long been a favorite saying of Fidel Castro’s, the memorable, simple-sounding formula he has cited when he has felt the need to silence a critic, justify an apparently indefensible repressive measure or simply remind Cubans that his all-seeing eye is ever upon them. Jesús Díaz’s ambitious novel “The Initials of the Earth” was published in Cuba in 1987, which makes it by definition a within-the-revolution product. But that distinction was, it seems, hard won — the prize at the end of an arduous journey from nothingness to the sanctifying light of full, Fidel-approved being. In an essay appended to this first English-language edition, Ambrosio Fornet, a friend of the writer’s, tells us that Díaz wrote a version of the book in the late ’70s that was “condemned ... to the limbo of a tacit censure.” When the censure was lifted (presumably also tacitly) in the early ’80s, Díaz had, we are told, “the composure and professional sobriety to sit down and rewrite the novel from scratch.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/review/Rafferty.t.html

2007-01-08,Nonfiction Chronicle ,"PIGEONS: The Fascinating Saga of the World’s Most Revered and Reviled Bird. By Andrew D. Blechman. (Grove, $24.) Consider the pigeon. Rather not? Well, reconsider, and do yourself a favor by reading Blechman’s charming book. For once, a subtitle that doesn’t exaggerate! For many of us, pigeons are just nuisances who foul the ground with their copious droppings. Yet the pigeon also inspires cults of rabid admirers who race them, breed them and show them off in pageants as bizarre as any snooty dog show. Blechman wittily traces the history of this gentle, intelligent, misunderstood bird — pigeon hatred, he shows, is a recent phenomenon — and journeys into its obsessive subcultures. He hangs out on Brooklyn rooftops with a die-hard who breeds “homers” (as racing pigeons are known) as if they were thoroughbreds, prepping them for a West Virginia-to-New York race called the Main Event. Then there is the world of dandified show breeds: Jacobins, among the oldest and most stylish, sport “a regal-looking mane of soft feathers, like Greta Garbo snuggled in a fur coat.” Blechman gives equal time to the haters, from avian exterminators to a pigeon-shooting club in Pennsylvania. Along the way, he offers plenty of revelations about pigeon habits. In fact, they’re rather tidy birds — it’s we pesky humans who make the urban poop problem worse by feeding them white bread, as processed flour makes for “rock-hard droppings.” Even those in the business of killing pigeons don’t think they’re that bad: “They’re pacifists,” an exterminator concedes. “They don’t mean any harm. They just want to eat and hang out.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/review/Price.t.html

Hewing to the visual and narrative conventions of ground-level combat realism, Mr. Eastwood’s film is less concerned with why they fight — they fight for the doomed, dubious cause of Empire, sometimes in the face of their own disillusionment, skepticism or indifference — than with how they fight. Which is to say, for the most part, how they are defeated and how they die.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/movies/awardsseason/07scot.html

2007-01-08,With Us or Against Us,"It is an old, and persistent, American affliction, an odd one for a democratic people: a weakness for dictators with charm and guile and a “modernist” veneer who rule exotic, dangerous lands. We may not know Bahrain but we can be friends with its king; we may not have known Persian ways, nothing, for instance, of the seminarian culture of Qum, but we knew Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and our travelers and diplomats and journalists felt at home in his court. Jordan may be a realm apart, a place of poverty and a breeding ground of angry warriors of the faith, but young King Abdullah II and his queen, Rania, are fixtures on the international circuit. And now that we have extravaganzas like Davos, no land is truly foreign, the exotic rulers can rub shoulders with Oliver Stone and Angelina Jolie. They can all serve on panels together. Why bother learning Arabic, Farsi or Urdu, when the rulers of distant lands offer a shortcut for the voyeurs and the travelers. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/review/ajami.html

Knowing the learning curve is steep, she put out a call last summer for interested underclassmen, and got 300 responses for 18 spots. Ms. Robbins doesn't use Second Life to impart textbook knowledge; she sends her students out to interact with other inhabitants to get them thinking and writing — ""about our own identity, and respecting the identities of others, and exploring the look of our own avatar."" A 500-word blog is due weekly. One day students dressed their avatars to look like pitchers of Kool-Aid (below) and traveled as a pack to observe reactions. Did they feel safer or bizarre? Another day, they switched genders by editing body form. ""I gave them a big box of clothes to use,"" Ms. Robbins says. ""The women in class all put on sort of dorky, unathletic clothing and became sort of intellectual-looking men. Men in the class all put on bikinis and had big guns.""

Some 40 avatars attended weekly ""in world"" classes and watched Professor Nesson's lectures on a large screen in the outdoor lecture pit adjacent to Austin Hall (above). Sessions were held outdoors because, ""for people who are new to Second Life, navigating the indoors can be difficult,"" says Rebecca Nesson, the extension-school instructor who taught the course with, yes, her father. Harvard's island is open to the public, and nonstudents eavesdropped: the law-school lectures were downloaded at least 300 times a week, and many avatars at large sat in on her class (although not many law students showed up). Some nonstudent avatars even logged in to visit Ms. Nesson during her virtual office hours.

2007-01-08,‘Wrestling with Gravy’," My parents battled through an acrimonious divorce right at the end of the war that supposedly made their generation the Greatest. They were almost central-castingly perfect opposites: Don Reynolds was short and fat, and at first meeting seemed like a hick from the dustbowls of Oklahoma and Texas; Edith Remick was a tall, dark-haired beauty, a refined and privately schooled graduate of Smith who had been brought up in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was given to upper-middle-class maladies like mild depression, frequently saw doctors for no apparent reason, and spent an inordinate amount of time resting at home. He was a whirlwind, she a lovely and fragile icicle. In the late thirties, he briefly owned part of a Quincy newspaper. One of his biggest advertisers was an upscale department store specializing in men's clothing, named Remick's. They met at a company picnic, and he swept her off her feet. She'd never seen anyone like him: such energy, such surprising smarts, such wild visions of the future. And such a sexual drive. I don't know whether he loosed her panties the very first night or was forced to wait till marriage-but I would bet the ranch, if I had one, that it was on his mind, raging, from the moment they met and every moment thereafter. He told her-and her family-that he intended to live in Quincy for the rest of their lives together. Within a month of their marriage, he sold his interest in the Quincy newspaper and announced that they were moving to Texas. He didn't ask her and hadn't forewarned her or anyone in the family; he just announced it, and off they went. Men could get away with things like that then. He then proceeded to hit the road in search of additional businesses. My sister, Nancy, was born in San Antonio in 1938, and the three of them moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he established the Southwestern Publishing Company, a solely-owned enterprise that operated half a dozen small newspapers. I was born in February 1942, barely two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Dad was drafted shortly after that. He grumbled about the army but finagled his way to Europe, where all the glamour was. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/chapters/0107-1st-reyn.html

2007-01-08,‘American Fascists’," I grew up in a small farming town in upstate New York where my life, and the life of my family, centered on the Presbyterian Church. I prayed and sang hymns every Sunday, went to Bible school, listened to my father preach the weekly sermon and attended seminary at Harvard Divinity School to be a preacher myself. America was a place where things could be better if we worked to make them better, and where our faith saved us from despair, self-righteousness and the dangerous belief that we knew the will of God or could carry it out. We were taught that those who claimed to speak for God, the self-appointed prophets who promised the Kingdom of God on earth, were dangerous. We had no ability to understand God's will. We did the best we could. We trusted and had faith in the mystery, the unknown before us. We made decisions - even decisions that on the outside looked unobjectionably moral - well aware of the numerous motives, some good and some bad, that went into every human act. In the end, we all stood in need of forgiveness. We were all tainted by sin. None were pure. The Bible was not the literal word of God. It was not a self-help manual that could predict the future. It did not tell us how to vote or allow us to divide the world into us and them, the righteous and the damned, the infidels and the blessed. It was a book written by a series of ancient writers, certainly fallible and at times at odds with each other, who asked the right questions and struggled with the mystery and transcendence of human existence. We took the Bible seriously and therefore could not take it literally. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/chapters/0107-1st-hedg.html

Opponents of smoking have complained about the practice for years. The impact of the change will be bipartisan; members of both parties regularly enjoy cigarettes and cigars as they relax in the lobby’s leather chairs between votes. The highest ranking smoker is Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the minority leader, who was perhaps anticipating the change when he headed to an outer balcony last week for a quick cigarette.

The law requires that teachers have at least a bachelor’s degree, meet state certification requirements and demonstrate knowledge in the subject they teach. State rules require teachers to have a degree in the subject they are certified to teach.

The Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, where Mary lived, prayed and  most scandalously  saw her adviser killed, is now inviting the public to take a gander at her private chambers, as well as those of her murderous husband, Lord Darnley. New additions to the chambers, which reopened last month after a six-year restoration, include an oak-paneled oratory and a 17th-century portrait of Mary (below), painted by an unknown artist, which hung at Windsor Castle for 300 years (www.royalcollection.org.uk). ...

This week, in his review of Barbara Ehrenreich’s “Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy,” Pinsky considers the cultural importance of Carnival, rock concerts and other celebratory mass events — phenomena not as far from the world of poetry as it might seem. “The emotional force of mass gatherings has profound importance,” he explained in an e-mail message. “I think we are desperate for something to counterbalance performances, great though they may be, that we experience electronically. We crave something else, something more personal as well as communal.” The public readings sponsored by the Favorite Poem Project, he says, “are among the most interesting group events I have witnessed: less performance than participation, and with a spirit hard to name, but unforgettable, and generated not just by each reader or poem, but by everyone there, together.” Click here for his review.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/review/Upfront.t-1.html

Babies are born rude, and it is their keepers’ duty to transform them from loud houseguests making outrageous demands at all hours of the night to charming people who might make some babies themselves. Etiquette is both method and model for this transformation, and teaching presentable behavior to one’s chattel is thus a noble endeavor.

2007-01-15,Inside the List,"EARLY AMIS:  It’s too soon to tell if Martin Amis’s new novel, “House of Meetings,” reviewed on this week’s cover, will climb onto the Times list in hardcover. The odds, historically speaking, are against it. Only two of Amis’s books have appeared here, and just barely: his novel “London Fields” made the bottom of the list for one week in 1990, and “Night Train,” another novel, hung on for two weeks in 1998. “House of Meetings” is Amis’s 19th book. His first, a novel called “The Rachel Papers,” was published in 1973, when Amis was 24. It did not receive a warm welcome in this newspaper. Writing in the Book Review, Grace Glueck described the book as a “crotch-and-armpit saga of late adolescence” that would probably not put Amis’s father, the novelist Kingsley Amis, in a competitive mood. In the daily newspaper, Anatole Broyard wrote: “Considering the advantages he has had, Martin has not covered himself with glory. Even allowing for his youth there is too much difference between his best and worst lines.” Broyard went on to call Amis — and this is not the kind of criticism a young novelist wants to hear — a lousy writer about “the minutiae of love.” “I find it difficult to imagine,” Broyard added, by way of example, “a room that ‘smelled of breasts.’” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/review/14tbr.html

For more than a decade, writers of thrillers and spy novels — and not a few conservative strategists — have been bedeviled by the transformation of the evocative evil empire into an oligarchic quasi-capitalist power. The world has provided other villains, but the peculiar charm of the pallid, citrus-starved Slavic heavy persists. And a spate of recent deaths of Russian whistle-blowers — most recently the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow and the polonium 210 poisoning of the former spy Alexander Litvinenko in London — shows that the Soviet back story isn’t entirely buried. Like the Stalinesque corpse that keeps popping up in Tengiz Abuladze’s film “Repentance” (from the now-quaint Glasnost era), dark secrets have an afterlife. And when you dig them up, you sometimes find evil interred with the bones.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/review/Schillinger2.t.html
2007-01-15,Anything but More Prisons,"Connecticut’s prison population, at 19,000, is inching up toward record levels, reversing a trend of slight reductions over the last two years. Incarcerating people in overcrowded facilities is inhumane and always expensive: it costs $29,500 a year to imprison each person. This problem did not develop overnight. The prison population rose steadily from the late 1980s until 2003. And the recent increase is not surprising, especially in light of last year’s rising crime rate. But the important thing to remember is that prison is not an answer to crime; bigger prison populations reflect society’s failure to find answers.

2007-01-15,‘Glory in a Line’," It seems best to think of Foujita in Paris. After all, he first attracted attention on the Left Bank, winning applause for his drawings of cats and for the startling whiteness of his nudes. At Parisian cafÈs during the 1920s, Foujita became a fixture, with his trademark bangs, round glasses, and hoop earrings; late into the night, he could be found chatting with cronies at the tables of his favorite haunts. He took pleasure in dressing up for his appearances around Paris's Montparnasse district and sported a slave trader's loincloth at a costume ball, but he also went through a Neo-Grecian period. Decked out in a Greek tunic and sandals, Foujita joined a group dancing in the woods. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/chapters/0114-1st-birn.html
2007-01-15,‘African Queen: The Real Life of the Hottentot Venus’," Saartjie Baartman, stage name the Hottentot Venus, emerged from behind a crimson velvet curtain, stepped out onto the three-foot-high stage in pointed green ribboned slippers, and surveyed her audience with a bold stare. Her high cheekbones and dramatic greasepaint and soot makeup gave her a prophetic, enigmatic look. Smoke coiled upwards from the pipe firmly gripped in the corner of her perfect Cupid's-bow mouth, drawing attention to her dimpled cheeks and heart- shaped face. It was a damp autumnal afternoon in London, 1810, and Saartjie was a long, long way from home. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/chapters/0114-1st-holm.html

2007-01-15,‘Exit A’," Severin Boxx rode home from football practice in the back of Coach Kindwall's van. In the front passenger seat, the coach's daughter applied a French manicure to her nails. The coach was also the base general of Yokota Air Base, Japan, and Severin's father's boss. These facts made Virginia Sachiko Kindwall untouchable and even more desirable than had she been a sergeant's daughter. Severin didn't wish to cause trouble for his father, and he intended to start the remainder of the season as outside linebacker, but he also wanted five minutes alone with Virginia, five minutes to speak in a calm and controlled voice, to practice his Japanese with her, five minutes at a ramen shop, slurping their noodles, laughter, together. The back of the van smelled of pigskin and wet gridiron and the still sweet sweat of boys. In a year or maybe in months, the boys Severin's age would begin to sweat like men, and stink like men, and maybe even suffer and want and love like men. But for now they were boys.

Of course there’s a freakishness about Hollywood glamour, hugely aided by Botox-smoothed faces and bad dye jobs. But even that didn’t seem as conspicuous this time. As a run-up to the Oscars, at least a couple of trends emerged — namely, the amount of colorful dresses (Drew Barrymore in pale pink Dior, America Ferrera in a purple Brian Reyes) and abstract flower prints (Sienna Miller in Marchesa, Chloe Sevigny in Yves Saint Laurent). Lacquered sequined dresses looked boring, and generally the emphasis was on drapery rather than embellishment. I wondered about the flower ornament behind Hilary Swank’s ear.

2007-01-17,Historians Appeal ‘Da Vinci Code’ Case,"The two historians who lost their plagiarism case against the British publishers of the best seller “The Da Vinci Code” by Dan Brown turned to the Court of Appeal in Britain yesterday in an effort to reverse their loss in a case that also saddles them with a legal bill of more than $2 million, The Associated Press reported. Lawyers for the historians, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, argued that the “vast amount of skill and labor” they expended in writing their book “The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,” first published in 1982, is “protectable.” They contend that Mr. Brown stole significant parts of it for his novel. Both books are based on the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child, and that the bloodline continues to this day. In April, Justice Peter Smith ruled that Random House had not breached the copyright of “The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,” and Mr. Baigent and Mr. Leigh were ordered to pay 85 percent of Random House’s legal bill, estimated at $2.6 million. In a statement, Random House expressed regret “that more time and money is being spent trying to establish a case that was so comprehensively defeated in the High Court.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/books/17davinci.html

Mr. Ban said he had stressed that “while there was a time when the relationship between the United Nations and the United States was not easy, it is time now to look for better days.”",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/world/18briefs-unpeacekeeping.html

2007-01-18,Queens: Man Charged With Murder and Assault,"A Ridgewood man has been charged with murder and assault in the shooting of two men outside a nightclub in Woodside three months ago, prosecutors said yesterday. The man, Victor Gavalo, 24, of Stephens Street, was awaiting arraignment on the charges last evening in Queens Criminal Court. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said that Mr. Gavalo was charged with shooting the men on Oct. 1 as they sat in a car outside Club Phenomenon, which was shuttered last month under the public nuisance abatement law. The dead man was Ernesto Salgado, 22, of Sunnyside; the wounded man’s identity was not released. NEW JERSEYNEWARK: MAN CHARGED IN FATAL SHOOTING An East Orange man already in custody on charges of setting his uncle on fire was charged with murder on Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a clothing store owner on Jan. 3, the police said yesterday. The man, Lamar A. Tidwell, 24, is charged with walking into the Clothing Wholesale and Retail Urban Warestore on Main Street and shooting the owner, Allen Cuff, 34. The men had argued a week earlier, said Judy Gagliano, an assistant Essex County prosecutor. Mr. Tidwell also faces weapons charges in that case. On Saturday he was charged with attempted murder; the authorities said he set fire to his uncle, Richard Burns, 54, in Mr. Burns’s apartment in East Orange after an argument. Mr. Burns suffered injuries over 22 percent of his body and was in critical condition yesterday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston.

2007-01-22,Lonely Hearts," For some of us, self-deprecation is the olive in the martini of romance. It’s that little something extra — a blast of salt and texture in a pool of cool velvet. The practice of demoting oneself has a counterintuitive power: it takes a truly secure person to self-flagellate. But in “They Call Me Naughty Lola,” a highly jaunty collection of personal ads from The London Review of Books, the intense self-deprecation among lovelorn Brits is less like an olive resting comfortably at the bottom of a martini glass and more like a peacock that has set itself on fire to flag down passing motorists. One ad runs, “Official greeter and face of Dalkeith Cheese Festival, 1974, seeks woman to 50 who is no stranger to failure, debt-consolidating mortgages and wool.” Another states: “Your buying me dinner doesn’t mean I’ll have sex with you. I probably will have sex with you though.” A third comes from the pen of a woman able to “start fires with the power of her premenstrual tension.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/books/review/Alford4.t.html

(It was sandwiched between Martin Cruz Smith’s “Gorky Park” and Paul Erdman’s “Last Days of America.”) Stone never had to cough up the $5, however. In the next issue of the Book Review, the following note ran under the best-seller rankings: “Last week Robert Stone’s ‘A Flag for Sunrise’ was reported in ninth place on the hardcover fiction list. This was the result of a computer error. The actual sales of the novel placed it quite far off the list.” Quite far off the list — did they have to rub it in? “Well,” Stone told me earlier this month, “I got to be on top of the world for a week.” It’s too soon to tell if Stone’s new book, the memoir “Prime Green,” will appear here.

2007-01-22,You Are What You Expect,"Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Put so starkly, the question has a fatuous ring. Unless you are in the grip of a bipolar disorder, you are probably optimistic about some things and pessimistic about others. Optimism tends to reign when people are imagining how their own plans will turn out. Research shows that we systematically exaggerate our chances of success, believing ourselves to be more competent and more in control than we actually are. Some 80 percent of drivers, for example, think they are better at the wheel than the typical motorist and thus less likely to have an accident. We live in a Lake Woebegon of the mind, it seems, where all the children are above average. Such “optimism bias,” as psychologists have labeled it, is hardly confined to our personal lives. In fact, as Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Jonathan Renshon argue in the current issue of Foreign Policy, it may help explain why hawkishness so often prevails at the national level. Wasn’t the Iraq war expected by proponents to be “fairly easy” (John McCain) or “a cakewalk” (Kenneth Adelman)?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/magazine/21wwln_lede.t.html

They took me on with open hearts and open mouths, and my schedule became extremely tight.” He has fed these robins a formula of “hamburg, chicken mash, kibbled worm and orange juice” for several days from a “yellow bamboo stick, split at one end, like a robin’s bill.” And now the birds “come streaming at me from bush and tree, trying for a landing on shoulder or cap, usually overshooting me in the fog and bringing up against a wall. This exhausts them and me.” Next, says White, he will have to “hop about on the lawn with my head cocked to one side, to show them how to get their own living.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/books/review/Blount.t.html

The oft-criticized Rex Grossman was good enough when it counted and Thomas Jones was impressive when he was in there. Aside from a big drive at the end of the first half, the Saints always looked a little defensive on offense. The lack of a rushing game hurt the Saints. Reggie Bush had four attemps for 19 yards. Deuce McAllister had six carries for 18 yards. Even though Drew Brees passed for 354 yards, he was never able to get comfortable in the pocket.The numbers were not impressive for Grossman.

I wish it had worked out that way, but it didn't. Paralysis is an often painful and confusing process that takes way more than two hours to get a handle on, and unlike a TV potboiler, the outcome is always in doubt.

After the conquest, his family continued to maintain close military ties: of his eight half-brothers, seven would have celebrated careers in the Indian and then the Pakistani army. In the West, Khan claimed, probably accurately, that his was the first generation in which there had not been a murder. He told a friend: ""In my country, life is very cheap. I could have men disposed of for a mere five hundred rupees-that is how we might deal with difficult situations. My people do not feel Judeo-Christian guilt: my people feel vengeance.""

With relatively calm waters, a steady breeze and short distances between anchorages, the islands have long been a draw for the sailing and yachting crowds. But it's become more popular in the last year or so, thanks to increased marketing efforts and expansions by charter companies. Barefoot Yacht Charters, www.barefootyachts.com, one of the longest running operators in the islands, organized about 400 sailing trips last year, up 45 percent from 2005. Prices for staffed yachts vary widely depending on the size and amenities. A 47-foot, air-conditioned catamaran with a two-person crew and accommodating six guests costs about $9,660 for seven nights. A week-long charter of a 126-foot sailboat that can accommodate 12 guests will run about $64,000.

In the autumn, Anglo-French forces invaded and briefly occupied Egypt in the debacle known as the Suez Crisis, which called time on British imperialism and saw off a prime minister. A few months earlier, at the Royal Court Theater on the edge of Chelsea, John Osborne’s “Look Back in Anger” had its first performance. Osborne was 26, a member of the generation that would oppose Suez, and the attitudes of his first major play and the astonishingly irreverent and fluent invective of its young protagonist, Jimmy Porter, captured a disenchantment in postwar English life that had never been seen on stage before. It shattered the well-bred conventions of English theater — to a large extent killed them off — and in the wider world became a symbolic text for people who wanted a different kind of Britain; one that, for example, would not have bombed Suez. Osborne, thanks to an alert theater press office, became the first “Angry Young Man.” Kenneth Tynan wrote famously in his review, “I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see ‘Look Back in Anger.’ ” Mary McCarthy, the play’s early American champion, compared Jimmy Porter to Hamlet, who had also “declared war upon a rotten society.” Arthur Miller thought it the only modern British play worth seeing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Jack.t.html

Calypso, a lilting style of Afro-Caribbean music, developed as a means of communication between African slaves. Soca is a modern form of calypso with an up-tempo beat. Half a century ago, Trinidadian percussionists invented pan by hammering out the ends of discarded oil drums. Today, visitors will find musicians practicing at so-called panyards throughout Port of Spain, the capital, especially in the weeks leading up to the island’s winter Carnival, which begins just after Christmas and runs into February.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28trinidad.html

In addition to its traditional croquet lawn, the Somerset on Grace Bay in the Turks and Caicos (www.thesomerset.com) is now offering extreme croquet on the beach. The biggest difference between traditional versus extreme croquet is the terrain; the extreme course shifts from short grass on flat land to beaches and hills, and on occasion, mud and water. Traditional croquet rules apply to the Somerset extreme course, with a few variations, including a ball being fair play if it’s whacked into the water, each player having to complete his turn within 10 seconds, and an arm wrestling match that determines who starts the game.

2007-01-29,To Resign or Not to Resign?,"Under what conditions should one resign? I ask the question in the context of the resignation from the Carter Center of 14 members of its board of councilors. (The full board numbers more than 200.) The reason they give is disagreement with the assertions made by President Carter in his new book, “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,” which argues that Israel bears a large share of the responsibility for the failure to achieve peace in the Middle East. In a letter to the former president, the resigning councilors declared that while the center they admired and supported “has always played the useful and constructive role of honest broker and mediator between warring parties,” the former president’s new book showed him to be abandoning his “historic role of broker in favor of becoming an advocate for one side.” That side is of course the Palestinian side, and it is that side’s views – complete with assertions of fact the letter writers find “false” and even “malicious” – that are now, they assert, being voiced by Carter.Originally I had thought to include this controversy in last week’s post on the controversy at Southern Methodist University over whether the George W. Bush library and museum should be housed on its campus. I argued (on Jan. 22) that those protesting the library because they were outraged by Bush’s policies made the mistake of conflating the question of the ethics of his administration with the question of whether the records of that administration were a valuable addition to a campus’s intellectual resources. The university (this or any other), I said, does not have a social or moral agenda that might lead it to reject materials because it disapproves of the values they embody. Universities have only an academic agenda (made up in equal parts of teaching and research), and being faithful to it does not require, and indeed precludes, making moral or political judgments on public figures. Therefore, I concluded, faculty members have no reason to be in a situation of estrangement from their university just because it welcomes the archives of a president whose actions they deplore.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/to-resign-or-not-to-resign/

2007-01-30,Memo Pad,"SHOELESS IN RENO? Unisys plans to open its first Registered Traveler program kiosk at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport in mid-February. But it is unlikely that the program will initially offer shoe-scanning technology, said Larry Zmuda, the company’s partner for homeland-security-related business. In an interview, Mr. Zmuda said the major concern for Unisys was ensuring the program’s “predictability” for members, who will undergo a federal background check and pay an annual fee to receive biometrically encoded I.D. cards and access to a special lane for expedited passage through the security checkpoint. Mr. Zmuda cited early snags with shoe-scanning technology being tested in Orlando by Verified Identity Pass, which already operates a Registered Traveler program called Clear at Orlando and four other airports. The Clear shoe-scanning technology, developed by General Electric Security, was intended to detect traces of explosives and suspicious metal, and to allow most travelers to pass through Clear lanes without having to remove their shoes. But the scanner rejected an unexpectedly high number of travelers’ shoes in Orlando, requiring members to remove their shoes just as they would at regular checkpoints.

In Parliament, Mr. Abe said the remark by his health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, left, was “inappropriate” and said he had reprimanded him. Mr. Yanagisawa also apologized for the remark, made Saturday at a political rally while calling on women to reverse Japan’s declining birthrate by bearing more children. The remark was the second recent slip of the tongue by a member of Mr. Abe’s administration. Last week, the defense minister, Fumio Kyuma, said President Bush “made a mistake” in attacking Iraq, contradicting Tokyo’s official pro-Washington stance. An opinion poll released yesterday by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun showed Mr. Abe’s approval has fallen to 40 percent, down from almost 70 percent when he took office in September.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/world/asia/30fbrief-japanminister.html

She also looks at how nature assimilates the body once life has left it, and in doing so confronts American attitudes toward death, through photographs examining the scars left on her property after an armed fugitive, being hunted by police, shot himself; landscapes from the Civil War battlefield of Antietam; a forensics study showing human decomposition; and images of the bones and skin of a pet greyhound long since departed.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/television/0131tvcol.html
