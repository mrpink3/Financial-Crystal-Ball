Limón is a master at making a simple idea (that of hindsight, seeing the bright side of things) askew. “And so I have/two brains now,” she writes. “Two entirely different brains.” Limón gives us two brains in her poems too, revealing new ways to view the world.

But at Mexico City’s six-month-old Esquina Común — which translates from the Spanish to “common corner” — home is more than a concept. This hidden weekend lunch spot, operated by the chef Ana González Serrano and her partner, Carlos Pérez-Puelles, is run out of a roughly 550-square-foot second-floor apartment on a leafy side street in the city’s Roma district. The former living area is now an extension of the modest dining room, which can seat up to 14 and is decorated with family photos and books from the couple’s own residence. In a newly opened lounge just off the main area, Pérez-Puelles pours wine and mezcal from a hyperpersonal selection. González Serrano, who previously oversaw the corn-based offerings at the city’s acclaimed Expendio de Maíz, cooks in a decidedly noncommercial kitchen (her mother, Beatriz, helps with prep), serving polished yet homey dishes that, on a given weekend, might include cheese-stuffed plantain croquettes with hoja santa chimichurri (recalling the coastal state of Veracruz from which half of González Serrano’s family hails); a tostada heaped with buttery turmeric-spiked lentils that is equal parts Mexico, India and France; or Peruvian red rice with pork ribs and huancaína, a cream sauce she makes with poblanos, alliums and cheese.

2022-05-13,Five Science-Fiction Movies to Stream Now,This month’s picks include two moon-titled movies and two of Mahershala Ali.,"Benjamin Cleary’s thoughtful film takes place in a near future that feels within reach: People travel on sleek trains and in driverless electric cars; they have cameras in their contact lenses. And while not widespread (yet), human cloning has become a reality. Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, effortlessly carrying the movie) decides to secretly replace himself with a duplicate so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son will be spared the grief of his death. Cameron elopes to a secluded facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a “molecularly regenerated” copy of his body. But then Cameron finds it hard to let go: Cameron 2 is himself — only one small mole differentiates them — and yet he is not, provoking complex feelings of fear, jealousy and defensiveness. One of the few people who understands the predicament is Kate (Awkwafina), a dying woman spending her last days at Dr. Scott’s compound after having been replaced in the outside world by a clone. Bathed in the cold palette and cool details (these characters listen to music on vinyl, of course) that are de rigueur for this type of arty sci-fi, “Swan Song” does get a little mopey, but it is also insightful about the difficulty of making huge decisions. And it posits a situation that may not be all that far-off.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/movies/science-fiction-movies-streaming.html

","In what some are calling a “death spiral,” the value of a number of digital currencies plunged last week, rattling investors’ faith in crypto markets. The implosion was particularly shattering for TerraUSD, or UST, which is called a stablecoin, meaning that it is pegged to a stable asset and should not fluctuate in price. But fluctuate it did: A big sell-off in a sister cryptocurrency sent UST to a low of 11 cents on Friday as Luna, a token closely tied to UST, cratered to $0. Bitcoin has been falling along with the Nasdaq, a benchmark that’s weighted toward technology stocks, making an investment in cryptocurrency just as risky as any other tech stock. The  crash drives home an unpleasant reality for investors — that an asset they hoped would be transformative has not fulfilled its promise.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/business/the-week-in-business-cryptocurrency-markets.html

He enrolled in an online hospitality business program through Cornell University, found advisers and a business partner, and then, because of Covid, was able to pick up a restaurant space at a reasonable rent.

He said he grew up eating Louisiana fare, which his maternal grandfather, Aubrey Gaines, known as Tiny, would cook at home. (Though he wasn’t a Louisiana native, Mr. Gaines learned the cuisine in his travels with a construction company.)

2022-05-24,What Vaccine Apartheid Portends for the Climate Future,Gestures of good will and concern from developed countries can hide nationalism so pointed that it amounts to something like sadism.,"The pandemic has been furnishing new and distressing episodes almost weekly for more than two years now. But what is in retrospect perhaps the most concerning, for me, came in May 2021, when the International Monetary Fund calculated that the full cost of vaccinating the large majority of the world’s vulnerable people would be $50 billion — just 1 percent of the money spent by Congress on pandemic relief and only about half of the money the United States has spent on fighting AIDS abroad. The I.M.F. called this “A Proposal to End the Covid-19 Pandemic” and meant it. The organization suggested the global payback for that $50 billion program, by 2025, would be $9 trillion — nearly a 200-fold return — in just four years. The humanitarian gains of a global vaccination effort would have been incalculable and still are. The diplomatic gains, as well.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/opinion/covid-19-pandemic-vaccine-climate-change.html

With Crown Shy, Harry’s, Nobu Downtown, Temple Court, the new Le Gratin and this gracious restaurant and bar by John Fraser in the Wall Street Hotel, it’s heading in that direction again. The hotel, owned by Paspaley, a major pearl company in Australia, is in a repurposed office building with a mercantile past. (The restaurant’s name — “the merchant” in French — reflects that.) An elegant bar leads to a white-tablecloth dining room with an elaborate raw bar and a couple of semiprivate tables framed in heavy drapes. Despite the formality of the setting, Mr. Fraser hopes to attract what he sees as a younger crowd who live and work in the area, by modernizing the French fare that shaped his career in Paris. “I’m looking at the 21st century, using global ingredients, sometimes out of left field,” he said. He’s supported by his executive chef, Rick Horiike, who worked at Buddakan and Wild Ink. Among the raw-bar items and appetizers on the lengthy menu are beef tartare, asparagus or blue crab enclosed in rice paper rolls; littleneck clams with cilantro mignonette; and lightly seared duck breast, sliced carpaccio-thin, with a drizzle of fish sauce caramel. Main courses include sweet rice with mushrooms cooked in a banana leaf, a version of homard à l’Américaine made with coconut milk, coffee-crusted pork chop with lentils, trout baked with a basting of miso, and roasted or steamed Dover sole for two with vermouth-lime butter. Desserts include a floating island with Japanese-style cheesecake.
