Eleven years later, he opened his own workshop in Paris, where he sold harnesses, bridles and saddles crafted with a stitch that can only be done by hand. After the advent of the automobile, Thierry’s grandson Émile-Maurice Hermès expanded the company’s offerings to include driving accessories and luggage trunks, as well as clocks and wristwatches with leather casings and straps. In 1923, the house even introduced a collection of dog collars, which were elaborately decorated with leather studs, metal looped rings and fringed trimmings. They became so popular that women began wearing them as belts; as the story goes, the French couturier Marie Callot Gerber, whose dogs wore the collars, commissioned Hermès to reinterpret them as wrist cuffs.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/t-magazine/hermes-mini-medor-crin-bag.html

It’s insane. The exercise is absurd to begin with,” says Gabriela Cámara, the chef and owner of Contramar and three other restaurants in the Mexican capital, at the outset of the video conversation I’d arranged to do just that: identify the specific meals or bites (or drinks) that best represent the metropolis’s formidable food scene right now. Nonetheless, Cámara was up for the challenge, as were the four other panelists I’d convened, all of whom live in Mexico City either year-round or part time: Ana Dolores, the chef and owner of Esquina Común restaurant in the Condesa neighborhood; Anais Martinez, who founded the Curious Mexican, a street-food tour company, and recently opened Manada, an all-Mexican cocktail and natural wine bar in Narvarte; the food writer Alonso Ruvalcaba, the author of the guide “24 Horas de Comida en la Ciudad de México” (2018); and Carla Valdivia Nakatani, T Magazine’s art director, who splits her time between Manhattan and Mexico City, where she co-owns a boutique in Roma. Before we met as a group, I’d asked each participant to nominate around 10 dishes, including a sweet and a drink, from 10 different spots, ranging from fine-dining restaurants to street carts and market stalls.

When I was young, after my family and I inevitably ate our entire supply of gelt by the first night, we would play dreidel using whatever tokens were left around the house — M&Ms, chocolate chips, even Cheerios if things got dire. Thankfully, if you’re stocking up on chocolate coins for your own gathering, there are now much more elevated options to throw in the pot. Veruca Chocolates in Chicago makes dark chocolate sea salt gelt without the usual foil wrapping, each piece instead dusted with a gold finish and molded to replicate ancient Judean coins. Fortnum & Mason stashes its milk chocolate coins inside a festive tin that resembles the storefront of its Piccadilly headquarters in London. And Li-Lac Chocolates, one of the oldest confectioneries in New York, offers milk and dark chocolate dreidels — though be prepared to bring an extra dreidel of your own, since you’ll want to eventually break into these ones to reach the gelt within.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/t-magazine/holiday-gift-guide.html

But that approach is changing as designers are increasingly placing moss in the spotlight, embracing it as a substitute for evergreens in holiday wreaths or draping swaths of it across mantels and tabletops.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/t-magazine/moss-flowers-arrangements.html

It was that he would be doing it with certain limitations. Phoenix is vegan and doesn’t wear any animal products, which meant that Crossman couldn’t use wool felt. “Immediately, I just felt it’s going to be a problem of what to make the iconic hat out of because it’s all going to be about the hat,” Crossman said in a video call.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/movies/napoleon-movie-hats.html

Next door to Silver Apricot she has opened this new spot, in the brick-walled premises that previously housed the beloved Pearl Oyster Bar. “So far the two restaurants seem to reinforce each other,” Ms. Zhao said. “We’ve had people come here for a drink and a snack, because Silver Apricot doesn’t have a bar, and then have dinner at Silver Apricot.” The Chinese American approach, intended to express something of the immigrant experience, is given a narrower frame than at Silver Apricot, with emphasis on the Southern Atlantic region where Ms. Zhao, a North Carolina native, was raised. So you’ll find turnip tots with lap cheong mayo and shrimp ketchup; shrimp cocktail with Chinese horseradish; Hong Shao collard greens with pork belly and Thai chile; grilled branzino; soy-poached chicken with collard greens and crispy hoppin’ John; and hot fried skate with chile crisp, buttermilk ranch dressing and sesame biscuits. Like its sibling, the tables are not set with chopsticks but they can be requested. The executive chef, Calvin Hwang, who grew up in New Jersey, worked at Crown Shy and Saga. The pastry chef, Janice Sung, was at Saga and One White Street; among her creations is a banana custard pie seasoned with Chinese five-spice. The restaurant has three areas. At the entrance is a 12-seat bar with a standing rail and a jazzy dragon splashed across the wall.

A recent work, a foot-high stoneware form, resembles a child’s stick-figure drawing, but with a Surrealist bent: Instead of a head, it has a blue-and-white delftware-style dinner plate; instead of eyes, there are painted butterflies. “I like combining serve ware with food shapes, as if elements of a meal had come together and were having a dinner party,” says Paek, who builds her works’ hollow extremities, including legs that look like hot dogs, with a machine called an extruder and molds other parts by hand before coating the finished forms with cobalt and iron oxide washes and glazes. The pieces reflect Paek’s training in animation, film and video at the Rhode Island School of Design — now in New York, she teaches ceramics at Doclay and at Greenwich House, and illustration at the Parsons School of Design — as well as her upbringing. Born in Seoul, she immigrated to Los Angeles with her family when she was 9 and was dazzled by the new culture she encountered there. “The first place we went was to a drive-through for hamburgers,” she says. “I think my parents saw it as a symbol of having made it, to live in a country where food was brought to your car.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/t-magazine/korean-ceramics-art.html

The name Lannan comes from a Gaelic word meaning “house,” and Maher’s choice of baked goods is intentionally nostalgic. Staples include an apple-and-custard-filled croissant and a custard slice with pink sour cherry icing. “Growing up, we made a chocolate sponge with little crunchy flaked almonds for birthdays,” Maher says. “We’d pour ganache over the top and I thought it was the most amazing thing to see it drip down the side.” (The chocolate cake at Lannan is now made with buttermilk and rye.) Maher, who grew up in the Scottish Borders with an artist mother and a scientist father, appreciates the way baking fuses creativity and precision. It takes three days to produce all the laminated dough pastries in preparation for the bakery’s Thursday through Sunday open hours. After the pain Suisse or crème brûlée Danishes disappear, inevitably by around 9 a.m., out come the cakes (from fig leaf sponge to quince Bundt), jambon beurres and finally a few sliced-up Roman pizzas and oatmeal raisin cookies. instagram.com/lannanbakery.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/t-magazine/lannan-bakery-edinburgh-scotland.html
