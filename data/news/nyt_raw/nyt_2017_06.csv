2017-06-01,I Know What You’ll Read This Summer,"Books by Kit Reed, Bracken MacLeod and others show us what’s new (and what’s not) in horror fiction.","Horror isn’t what it used to be. In the introduction to Philip Fracassi’s first collection of short fiction, BEHOLD THE VOID (JournalStone, $29.95), Laird Barron writes: “Horror and weird fiction are ascendant a decade and a half into the 21st century; an abundance of market opportunity and artistic talent has inspired a surge of creativity unrivaled in the modern days of the genre.” Although it isn’t clear precisely what Barron means here — aren’t “an abundance of … talent” and “a surge of creativity” kind of the same thing? — his enthusiasm, for both horror in general and Fracassi in particular, is unmistakable, and his words carry some weight: Barron was himself the genre’s hot kid 10 years ago and is now, after a bunch of nominations and awards, practically an éminence grise. By “modern days” he appears to mean since the 1970s and ’80s, a period he calls “the heyday of North American category horror” (while citing, among other touchstones, a couple of novels written in the ’50s and ’60s). So is something truly new happening in horror (“and weird”) fiction now?

We expected just to gawk at the hard bodies and giggle at the corny jokes — and we did that — but we were surprised that the film had a harder edge.

This trick did not go over well with English convent school nuns. Between the world wars, Carrington was thrown out of one school after another for persistently odd behavior. When she came of age, she fled England — and her family’s fortune — for France and the Surrealists, for a life crammed with incident and adventure, occasional poverty and steady productivity.

(A movie adaptation of the first book in the series, “Crazy Rich Asians,” is in preproduction with Warner Brothers.) The aura of gaudy glamour and bling in these books may seem like the stuff of soap operas, but it’s essentially true to the world in which Kwan was raised — so much so, he has said, that his relatives have no interest in reading his work. “Most of my family is completely puzzled by these books, and they don’t really understand what the fuss is all about,” he told the website Nylon last month. “They don’t really get the humor, and it’s just like, ‘Everyone has a hundred million dollars, what’s the big deal?’ or ‘Why is any of this interesting?’” That’s O.K. with Kwan. He’s not writing for his family anyway. “I think people who are going to pick up a book called ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ or ‘Rich People Problems’ are looking for the fun and the froth; they’re looking for an escape. They’re looking for it to be like a fun romp into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,” he said. “They’re not looking for Cormac McCarthy.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/review/satires-of-the-ultrarich-from-one-of-their-own.html

So it’s a bit of a shock that “Dawson City: Frozen Time” begins with a brightly colored, completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears, talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/movies/dawson-city-frozen-time-review.html

Tolkien’s son traces the romance between a human and an elf through his father’s notes and drafts and epic poems.","RETURN OF THE KING: On the hardcover fiction list of late, the dead are looking lively. Last week Michael Crichton, who died in 2008, debuted at No. 2 with “Dragon Teeth,” a cowboys-and-fossils thriller currently at No. 3. And this week J.R.R. Tolkien, who died in 1973, lands at No. 6 with “Beren and Lúthien,” about the Middle-earth romance between a human and an elf. Tempting as it is to picture the sentient heads of Crichton and Tolkien preserved in jars somewhere, “Futurama” style, spinning new stories, the reality is more mundane: Both books were exhumed from the authors’ files in varying states of readiness and prepared for publication by their estates. In Tolkien’s case that means readers will find copious notes from his third son, Christopher Tolkien, who traces the story’s evolution through a series of epic poems that are — like much of the Middle-earth canon — wildly inventive and technically flawless and also sort of insufferable at times. Had Shakespeare written Norse-inflected fantasies, they might have sounded something like this:",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/books/review/a-return-to-middle-earth-44-years-after-tolkiens-death.html

I expected God and money to be kept separate, at least outwardly, more in keeping with the discreet, cash-in-envelopes Christian churches of my youth. Yet around the exterior of the tiny, seafoam green 19th-century mosque across the street from my Istanbul home, I discovered an array of shops: a locksmith, a market, a kebab joint, a teahouse and a rotisserie vendor whose delicious, buttery chickens twirled all day outside. One of the imams who preached at the mosque was a part-time real estate agent. The attempted military coup last July lasted until the wee hours of the night, yet my little green mosque was, as usual, open and ready early the next morning for prayer; the locksmith whose shop was part of the complex waddled in by 9 a.m., and the happy blend of prayer and small-time hustle in Istanbul continued unabated.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/magazine/reading-erdogans-ambitions-in-turkeys-new-mosques.html

So the arrival at long last of a follow-up, “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” (new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 7), is being heralded as a bit of a second coming: It appeared on the Book Review’s cover this month, and Roy has been the subject of admiring profiles in India and England and the United States. Not that she embraces the attention. “I was never a person who thought, Now that I’m famous, I’ll go live in London or New York and live the dream,” she told The Guardian. “I’m a social cripple in a cocktail party.

Although Herman Melville wrote every word of “Moby-Dick,” he could never read it as a reader — could never unsee the origin of all those wild metaphors, never turn the page with true surprise. Artists may know when they’ve done something great, but they’ll never know what it’s like to experience it from the other end.

In the United States, this development has been exacerbated by ongoing conservative recruitment on issues of race that has reinforced opposition to immigration. On the liberal side, the Democratic Party and the center-left European parties have been allied in favor of globalization, if we define globalization as receptivity to open borders, the expansion of local and nationalistic perspectives and support for a less rigid social order and for liberal cultural, immigration and trade policies. In recent decades, these parties, both in Europe and in the United States have begun to include and reflect the views of large numbers of well-educated elites — relatively affluent knowledge or creative class workers — in alliance with predominantly nonwhite minority constituencies of the less well-off.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/opinion/nationalism-globalism-edsall.html

Visible only to children, this catlike woodland spirit springs from the imagination of the great Japanese animator and auteur Hayao Miyazaki. In this 1988 Studio Ghibli film, totoros — from dustball size to as large as a bus — provide joy and solace to Satsuki and her younger sister, Mei, who have accompanied their father to a rural area far from home while their hospitalized mother recovers from a mysterious illness. Although the girls’ odyssey ends happily, the film never denies the omnipresent specter of mortality or the power of children’s fears. GKids and Fathom Events will present the movie, accompanied by international shorts, in select theaters on Sunday at 12:55 p.m. (in English) and on Monday at 7 p.m. (in Japanese with English subtitles) as the opening event in Studio Ghibli Fest 2017, a six-film monthly Miyazaki series.

New fatherhood had triggered a variety of symptoms in me, but none quite as unexpected as a rising thirst for some tradition to share. Because I’m an immigrant short on hallowed rituals, I decided that fandom would be our foundational bond, the thing we could talk about in the idle or tense times to come.

2017-06-30,Whose Fault Is It Anyway? Three Books on the Shifting Nature of Responsibility in American Politics,How responsibility came to mean accountability — and why that matters for issues of justice and welfare reform.,"At some point in the last half-century, American politicians started talking about responsibility in a new way. Where “responsibility” once referred to the duties of the nation to its citizens, or of the citizens to the nation, or of fellow citizens to one another, it now came to mean the obligations of the individual to himself. Responsibility was personal responsibility. You might date the beginning of this shift to 1968, when Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, announced in a speech at the Republican National Convention that it was time to stop blaming “society” for people’s failings and to start accepting that “each individual is accountable for his actions.” You might date the completion of this shift to 1993, when President Bill Clinton exhorted Americans in his first Inaugural Address to “demand responsibility from all” and “to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/books/review/3-books-shifting-nature-responsibility-american-politics.html
2017-06-30,Memory,Selected by Terrance Hayes.,"This poem, taken from a collection called ‘‘Madwoman,’’ makes me ponder the relationship between memory and madness. Memory bruises and is bruised.

The rest of the book both expands and makes exact the roots of memory, madness and womanhood implied here. But you can see how beautifully the poem stands alone.
