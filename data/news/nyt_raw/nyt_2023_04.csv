2023-04-04,Gary Indiana Doesn’t Travel in Any Circles,The author of “Rent Boy” and “Do Everything in the Dark” reflects on a life of writing and art.,"Gary Indiana is the author of eight novels and hundreds of essays that revel in the seedier depravities of American decline: murder, fraud, incest, obsession. In his 1989 debut, “Horse Crazy,” Indiana revives Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice” (1912) in Lower Manhattan, where a writer not unlike the author falls for a young artist who may or may not be hustling him. His trilogy of crime novels, “Resentment” (1997), “Three Month Fever” (1999) and “Depraved Indifference” (2002), borrows material from the high-profile murder cases of the Menendez Brothers; Andrew Cunanan (who killed Gianni Versace); and the grifter Sante Kimes, elevating the New Journalism of Truman Capote and Norman Mailer to postmodern carnivalesque. For much of his career, aside from a brief stint in semi-obscure prominence as the staff art critic of The Village Voice from 1985 to 1988, Indiana’s writing has eluded the attention of the mainstream literary establishment. But at 72, he has found a new audience. In May, Semiotext(e) will reissue “Do Everything in the Dark” (2003), Indiana’s mordant depiction of the New York art world aging into a new millennium, and “Rent Boy” (1994), his noir about a male prostitute who becomes an unwitting accomplice to an organ harvesting scheme, was brought back into print by McNally Editions in January.

A match can light the candles, but Mr. Andino and his business partner Philip Testa, who was at the Tao Group, had to wait a good five months for the gas to be turned on, so the real cooking could begin. They also gathered celebrity backers, like the hockey star Jacob Trouba and the rapper Tariq Trotter, also known as Black Thought and a founder of the Roots. The menu features a layered baked potato with a choice of toppings, shaved brussels sprouts salad, roast chicken marinated in peri-peri sauce, Wagyu skirt steak, and rigatoni with lobster. The space is divided into a bar area up front with tables, a dining room with blue velvet seats, and an open kitchen to permit Mr. Andino to be on view as he attends to his sauté pans. He is a native of Toronto, attended Cornell University’s hotel administration school and worked at Spago and the French Laundry.

Chang’s harried, working single mom (Mardy Ma) is tired of his indecisiveness, telling him early on, “You always change your mind, so find something and stick to it.” He can’t commit to a haircut, much less a career path. But when he bets the school jock (Chase Liefeld) that he can learn to dunk a basketball in time for homecoming, Chang finally finds something he can stick to. Written and directed by Jingyi Shao, who honed his skills helming commercials and short films, “Chang Can Dunk” puts an Asian American teenager front and center in this coming-of-age story that’ll appeal to older kids, who will relate to Chang’s desire to get the girl (Zoe Renee), beat the bad guy and — most important of all — dunk that basketball.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/movies/kids-movies-streaming.html

For anyone who’s ever experienced racist microaggressions, that statement will cut deep. Everyday bigotry thrives by turning the political into the personal, by making you wonder: Is it society, or is it just me? “Exile” builds a taut thriller around this uncertainty.

Still, oil prices have fallen far from where they were a year ago in the immediate wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/the-week-in-business-opec-oil-production.html

Braswell would call nurses with the details of their next jobs.

She was one of his most reliable nurses, and she liked working with him. He knew her schedule and the jobs she preferred; he was the kind of hands-on guy who would, in a pinch, drive out in his own car to give a nurse a ride. Still, the whole process could be time-consuming. After a week’s worth of jobs was complete, Handy would drive to Braswell’s office in St. Petersburg — usually getting there before he’d even shown up and unlocked the door — and wait in the parking lot with a handful of other nurses for him to arrive and cut her a check.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/magazine/gig-jobs-apps.html

Things move fast with barely a beat of introduction. Those unfamiliar with the American philanthropists Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and her husband, Douglas Tompkins, may feel in the film’s opening minutes as disoriented as if they’ve been dropped in the wilderness. One catches on that the Tompkins purchased a lot of it: more than one million acres in Argentina and Chile, with the goal of gifting the land back as recognized national parks. The scale of the couple’s ambition teeters on the surreal. Asked in archival footage about a massive snow-flocked volcano on the horizon, Doug casually replies, “Yeah, that came with it.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/movies/wild-life-review.html

Wells’s imperious Invisible Man is not above stealing the clothing of his harassers, forcing them to pursue him naked through the village square.

It’s just warm enough to be tempted to splay out on a lawn chair and doze off. Or better yet, to stay awake and take it all in. My favorite time of day during my favorite month is evening, when the sky stripes turquoise and coral. There’s a distinct smell that blankets the evenings. Grassy, mossy, fresh and earthy.

It can create an awkward dynamic for the famouses: Denounce your fan base’s zealotry, and you risk seeming ungrateful.

Every room is a joyful mash up of historically inspired wallpapers, jewel-toned painted walls, wood paneling and a mix of antique and custom-designed furniture. “We wanted to keep some of its original Victorian-style interiors but also add some inspiration from other design movements at that time: Art Nouveau, English Arts and Crafts movement and the trend of collecting objects from Asia,” says Greco. Although the Villa is technically part of the eight-month-old Sommerro hotel (the main building, also designed by GrecoDeco, houses 231 rooms with an Art Deco public bath and swimming pool) and is connected to it by a discreet walkway, it was designed to be its own intimate space with access to a private kitchen and chef. The ground floor is made up of common rooms including Spectre, an honesty bar with silver gilded walls and tiles of salvaged golden onyx. Greco hopes that guests feel like they’re “staying in an eccentric private mansion.” From $615 a night, villainkognito.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/t-magazine/pinguino-mexico-folk-art.html

It’s a sound that grounds you in a moment, insisting upon poetic forms to talk about experience that’s personal and political, social and shared. I love the way she mixes video, live performance, music and poetry. She has this brilliant way of calling together vast materials and atmospheres.

First, I saw my friend the actress Adjoa Andoh in [Kalungi Ssebandeke’s] “Assata Taught Me,” which Lynette directed in 2017. Later that year, I saw Lynette’s own play “#Hashtag Lightie,” and it took me back to “Silhouette,” a play I’d co-written with Patricia St. Hilaire in 1983 that also explored mixed-race identity. Then she became artistic director of the Bush Theatre in 2019. That’s when I really paid attention.

We were in a “Cinderella” pantomime at Hackney Empire in London. She was in the chorus, and I noticed her the minute she opened her mouth. She’s this funky mezzo-soprano, and she’s little, but she’s what we Jamaicans call talawa — she’s powerful. That was her professional stage debut, and it was also during that show that my wife, Susie McKenna, who was directing, and I fell in love. Since then, I’ve done more jobs with Lexi and watched her have this phenomenal career. She’s one of those performers who genuinely moves me, and her being the first [full-time] Black Elphaba in “Wicked” [in 2008] was such an achievement.

There’s something courageous in her; she’s not going to walk into a space unprepared. She’s wise for her years and grounded. There was a tender day on set [for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” filmed after Chadwick Boseman, the franchise’s original star, died in 2020] when we connected deeply.

It has all these incredible plants from equatorial places including Kenya. Growing up in Nairobi, I developed a real sense of how nature thrives and survives around us, and my work is in part about looking for nature’s healing qualities, which can teach us things in a language all their own.

The character is like a loaded weapon — there’s the possibility of danger at any time. Not every actor her age can make you feel that. I had that quality early on — one thing I was recognized for because of “Natural Born Killers” [the 1994 film in which Lewis played a violent fugitive] was that I could scare you.

I also suggested she look at my first novel [“A Feather on the Breath of God,” 1995], and out of her thesis came her first novel, “Chemistry” (2017). There are several similarities between those books. Our backgrounds are very different, but we both wrote about coming of age in immigrant families. Also, we both aim for clear, clean sentences and feel strongly about the importance of humor in our fiction.

I first found your art on strap-on.org in the early 2000s. The way that you drew trans people was different from other portrayals I’d seen at the time, when there was so much trying to be invisible. Your art was a refutation of that. It was affectionate but also unafraid to be grotesque or hideous or beautiful.

Soon it was found in major cities across the country, offering those who had migrated — as well as those who hadn’t — a taste of those Southern staples. Soul food, the food historian Adrian Miller said, is “an immigrant cuisine and ultimately a national cuisine.”",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/dining/soul-food-chefs-erick-williams-shenarri-freeman.html

As subsequent installments spread across the continent, ambitions expanded as well; what began as, essentially, a foodie tourism show became a meditation on celebrity, aging and friendship. This most recent (and reportedly final) installment finds the duo retracing the steps of Odysseus, but this time around, it’s not just about pretty scenery and funny imitations. We’ve grown attached to these slightly fictionalized versions of the actors, and the pathos of the closing sections are both unexpected and genuine.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/movies/the-trip-to-greece-offbeat-streaming-movies.html

The appeal is universal, he argues: Like late-middle-aged adults flipping through vacation pictures that “remind us, or delude us into thinking, that family relations were once simpler and happier than they are now,” almost every society finds itself mythologizing and romanticizing its own origin or past. But the peril is inherent in the romance: No less than the utopian futurist, the backward-looking romantic is tempted to violently wrench the present out of joint, to sacrifice lives and treasure on the altar of a “lost wholeness,” a fantasy of never-was.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/opinion/in-defense-of-nostalgia.html

A focus of the case had been Mr. Carlson’s texts, showing him denigrating Donald J. Trump after the 2020 presidential election. But it wasn’t until the day before the defamation trial was to begin that Fox leadership discovered private messages sent by Mr. Carlson that had been redacted in previous legal filings showing him making highly offensive and crude remarks.

This car has an invisible steering wheel!,” mimicking steering on the left side of the car (as we do on this side of the pond).
