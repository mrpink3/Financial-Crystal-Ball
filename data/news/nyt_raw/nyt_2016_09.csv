2016-09-01,How to Tickle Someone,Be unpredictable. Keep things consensual.,"“Stop, start again, be surprising,” says Marina Davila-Ross, a professor at Britain’s University of Portsmouth who studies laughter and play. Unpredictability is the key element of tickling, which is why you cannot tickle yourself. Brains are prediction machines; if your own hand reaches in for a tickle, your brain will foresee and cancel out the results. (Research shows that some schizophrenics are able to tickle themselves because they don’t make the same distinctions between self and other.) Davila-Ross has tickled humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas, and she says sometimes just the pretouch anticipation evokes laughter. Only the great apes regularly tickle one another, although many animals, including rats, cats and dogs, enjoy it. (In one study, rats kept in social isolation and exposed to regular electrical shocks exhibited less fear and lower catecholamine stress hormones when tickled daily by a researcher.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/magazine/how-to-tickle-someone.html

Resistance to the guidelines has been so strong in hard-core segregationist areas that in a great majority of cases the Education Office has accepted token compliance rather than invoke Title 6 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and withdraw federal assistance. As a result, more than 96 percent of some 1,500,000 Negro pupils in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina will be attending all-Negro schools as they return to classes. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 2, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/1966-desegregation-in-trouble/

2016-09-02,1891: Fraud at the Bank of England,From the archives of The International Herald Tribune: The Bank of England suffers fraud in September 1891.,"For some days persistent rumors have been in the air of a colossal fraud said to have been perpetrated on the Bank of England. On Monday the amount alleged to have been stolen was currently given as £250,000, and since then the sum has advanced by leaps and bounds, until today it was confidently asserted in the City that it amounted to half a million. These rumors have obtained a degree of credence in banking circles which calls for authoritative treatment. There is no truth whatever in the report, which, if well founded, would have startled the commercial world, and must have produced results disastrous to the largest interests. The Governor of the Bank of England states that there is absolutely no foundation for the rumors. The story, it appears, arose as follows: It will be remembered that in February last a counter robbery was effected at the Bank of Scotland. Certain of the securities then stolen have been within the last few days presented for payment in Paris, and in one of the Paris papers an announcement appeared confusing the Bank of Scotland with the Bank of England, and stating the amount of the frauds to have been £250,000. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 3, 1891 ",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/1891-fraud-at-the-bank-of-england/

He asked what would happen to Islam and Christianity without worship of Mohammed and Christ, then added; ‘‘I want Indonesia to have a hero the Indonesians can be proud of.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 3, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/1966-sukarno-likens-self-to-christ/

2016-09-02,Inside the List,"Elizabeth Letts’s “The Perfect Horse,” No.17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list, is about a breed of horses abducted by the Nazis.","Saddle Up: As any observer of the best-seller lists can tell you, World War II exerts a deep hold on the popular imagination. Lately, though, readers seem less interested in the Nazis’ human victims than in the quirky corners of the war. A couple of years ago, Robert M. Edsel (and his co-writer, Bret Witter) spent 21 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list with “The Monuments Men,” about Allied efforts to retrieve looted art from the Germans; now Elizabeth Letts’s “The Perfect Horse” — No. 17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list — tells a similar story about the mission to save a breed of horses, the noble Lipizzaner stallions, that the Nazis abducted to create a “master race” of war animals. General Patton himself approved the rescue: “Get them. Make it fast,” the book quotes him saying. But why divert military resources to protect horses, however mighty? According to an essay Letts wrote for the ­Amazon blog Omnivoracious, the answer lies with the Army’s legacy of training cavalry officers. “Turns out, the interwar years are called the cavalry’s golden age,” she says. “Army-bred horses won Olympic medals and Army-trained riders shone in international competitions. To belong to the U.S. Cavalry was to be a skilled rider. It was also to be trained in a code of honor known to cavalries around the world: Always take care of your horse first. In the last days of World War II, the world’s most priceless purebreds were in danger of being slaughtered for food. Their only hope was a group of American soldiers who by chance were camped out nearby. As it happened, these were the soldiers of the Second Cavalry — one of America’s most storied mounted units, and one of the last to be mechanized. . . . As Patton liked to remind people, many of the most celebrated leaders in World War II got their start as cavalry officers, and in the last days of the war, when the priceless purebreds were in danger, these men remembered the lesson to put the horses first.” Letts is, no surprise, a horse lover herself: Her previous best seller, “The Eighty-Dollar Champion,” was about the show jumper Snowman, and in her Twitter biography she admits she “never got over Black Beauty.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Colonial Office and other friends of the islanders are sending them comforts and stores, and at the offices of the Crown Agents for the Colonies (who are packing and dispatching the goods free) there have been busy scenes the past few days.

The only flag the islanders are said to have to prove their allegiance to the Empire is a red ensign, and the Colonial Office is sending out a brand new Union Jack. There are sure to be hearty cheers in the lonely settlement when the new flag arrives and is unfurled. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 1, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/1916-tristan-da-cunha-to-receive-mail/

This is what Joel Benenson, Clinton’s chief campaign strategist, had to do on CNN one morning in late August, when the anchor Chris Cuomo confronted him with questions about Clinton’s meetings with donors to the Clinton Foundation, in the years when she was secretary of state. The subtext was whether Clinton had been forthcoming enough about the influence of her private connections on her exercise of official power. Benenson, like any good surrogate, tried to change the subject. “Let’s talk about Donald Trump,” he said. “The man who said, ‘I will release my tax returns if I run for president.’ Who knows what we’ll find if he releases those tax returns? I think if you want to be hammering somebody in this race day in and day out about disclosure,” he added, it should be Trump.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/how-much-disclosure-do-we-really-expect-from-candidates.html

Places like Monessen, Pa., and Hickory, N.C., have come to be seen as central to his rise — and that of Bernie Sanders, before he bowed out — as well as symbols of a national preoccupation during this election season: the downsides of globalization. Earlier this year, research that led to an academic paper from several economists titled “The China Shock” found that between 1999 and 2011, the growth in imports from China killed about 2.4 million American jobs, one million or so of them in manufacturing. That’s a much greater impact than most economists had been assuming, and the 2.4 million figure has come up again and again in debates over global trade.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-global-trades-impacts.html

The class was studying transcendentalism, and the students were required to read excerpts from an essay called “Nature,” by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson was an unmethodical writer with low, puffy sideburns who liked to work himself up into paragraphs of rapture. When it came time for him to write an essay or give an oration — about nature, say, or self-­reliance — he combed through his voluminous journals and pulled out choice bits that were more or less on topic, and he glued them together with some connective prose. For instance, in “Nature,” Emerson writes: “Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/fortress-of-tedium-what-i-learned-as-a-substitute-teacher.html

He quickly defined the mouth with the Nars Velvet Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl — a bright red that, he says, “every girl I know wears” — then tapped on Nars Coeur Battante fuchsia blush (a limited-edition shade that’s in tight circulation; try blush in Exhibit A for a close match), creating a matte effect that’s “a little sicker and more rock and roll.” Of the two-step application, Carrasquillo said, “It’s an old-school trick that I learned back in the ’80s when they didn’t have matte lipstick. You had to powder the lip to get that texture.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/t-magazine/fashion/creatures-of-the-wind-red-lip-fashion-week-beauty.html

I have always felt that his images were so artfully designed, produced and in many cases made statements that went far beyond anything he was thinking about in the short period of time he had to get an image done for a client.” Displayed for the first time in a gallery setting, the large archive has been beautifully brought back to life after many decades in the dark.

Sandy or muddy substrates like riverbanks hold prints, too, but don’t bother with forest floors blanketed in leaves or pine needles. “If you have a nice fresh snow, you can track an animal all day, come back the next day and pick up where you left off,” Rezendes says. Snow can help prevent your getting lost too, by allowing you to trace your own imprints back to your starting point.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/how-to-track-an-animal.html

Over two seasons of “Narcos,” the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar has been documented in a heady rush of information, so much that Murphy’s ubiquitous voice-over has been necessary to cram it all in there. And that’s been a primary strength of the show: The scope of Escobar’s empire and the multifront effort to dismantle it isn’t easy to encapsulate in any medium.

Space officials said the leak in the Titan-2 rocket which was to have launched astronauts Charles Conrad and Richard Gordon on a three-day flight was small but necessitated the defueling of the rocket. Technicians later repaired the hole, which was in a spot-weld about halfway up the 109-foot rocket. After checks, officials rescheduled the flight for tomorrow [Sept. 10] morning.

Over the past half-century, after all, Wolfe’s own work has contributed mightily to the evolution of a certain kind of language — or the evolution of a style, anyway: the neon-lit, whiz-bang exploding cigar of a sentence, bristling with exclamation points and packed tighter than a spring-loaded snake in a can of peanuts. As a founder of New Journalism in the 1960s and the author of sprawling social novels beginning with “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” in 1987, Wolfe has cast a big shadow on generations of American writers. But it turns out mere influence isn’t what he has in mind with “The Kingdom of Speech,” new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 14. Instead, Wolfe trains his sights on biological evolution — specifically, Darwin’s theory of natural selection — and what he sees as its inadequacy to account for the existence of human language. Along the way, he also attacks the neo-Darwinian linguist Noam Chomsky, who has advanced the idea of language as an innate evolutionary trait.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/books/review/tom-wolfe-inside-the-list.html

Last year, approximately 884 million people — more than twice the population of the U.S. — visited Ikea stores.

2016-09-12,An Olive Oil Revolution in Tunisia,Tunisian olive oils are now worth savoring thanks to tighter restrictions on labeling and production.,"Tunisia was the featured country at this summer’s Fancy Food Show in New York, and almost half of that country’s exhibits were promoting extra-virgin olive oil. The industry, which has existed since Roman times, has shifted to a higher-end product for export to Europe and America. Although Tunisia’s extra-virgin olive oil is still sent in bulk to Europe for anonymous blending, production rules and labeling certifications for extra virgin and organic have been tightened. Now 100 percent of what’s in a bottle labeled Tunisian is indeed from Tunisia. Some oils tend to be lighter, sweeter and less peppery than their European counterparts. For example, Terra Delyssa Extra Virgin Olive Oil is typically mild and fruity with a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste (try it in a salad dressing), and Olivi Chemlali de Djerba Extra Virgin Olive Oil is lighter and even more delicate. Les Moulins de Mahjoub, an organic extra-virgin oil, is deeper in color, more viscous and herbal, with a nice green olive bite. It would add a sleek finish to grilled fish and vegetables: Terra Delyssa, $8.99 for 34 ounces, worldmarket.com; Olivi, $14.90 for 8.45 ounces, from amazon.com; Les Moulins de Mahjoub, $19.99 for 12.5 ounces, from amazon.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/extra-virgin-olive-oil-tunisia.html

2016-09-12,"At 3.1 Phillip Lim, Eyeliner Meets Architecture","For the designer’s spring/summer 2017 show, the makeup artist Francelle Daly created a graphic look that played on the idea of negative space.","The designer Phillip Lim is a passionate collector of art (furniture made by cabinetmakers is a particular interest). So it made sense that the makeup look at his spring/summer 2017 show took an artist-driven approach. Backstage, the makeup artist Francelle Daly slicked on graphic eyeliner, then removed the edges for a conceptual play on negative space. “It’s about modernizing the way we wear eyeliner,” she explained of her technique — which stood out for not only its impactful quality, but also for its ease of application. Daly simply outlined the eyes, “saturating” the upper and lower lash lines in Nars Eyeliner Stylo in Carpates, then traced Nars Kohliner Minorque along the inner waterline. Then, for the fun part: Daly dipped her Q-tip in a water cleanser and “chopped” off the inner and outer corners of her lines, customizing the shape to each models’ eyes. “Maybe it’s a little smaller at the bottom, maybe it’s a little bigger on top, just to make sure you don’t overpower the eye, or look like a raccoon,” she noted. Daly also recommends stepping back and looking in the mirror to ensure your liner is somewhat symmetrical on both eyes. But don’t agonize over it: “It’s all about what works best for you when doing your makeup, and being your own artist.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/t-magazine/fashion/phillip-lim-eyeliner-beauty-fashion-week.html

I was motivated to advance in rank to get above the bad actors and to try to do something about them.

The best way to survive a disaster is to go into it prepared. As soon as you board a boat, familiarize yourself with the exits, the stairways, the signage. Ships lose power; corridors fill with smoke. “Even with your eyes closed, you should know: If I come out of my room and take a left, then a right, then a left, there’s the stairs,” Gosling says. Know where your life jacket is and practice putting it on, but don’t wear it until you’ve reached the deck or have been instructed to do so by a crew member.

After allowing the hair to set, he carefully twisted and twirled small sections around a curling iron with the dimensions of a chopstick. The real power move was to stop short of what Duffy termed “instant noodle hair,” by literally clapping the curls between the palms of the hands to break them up, for a more modern, lived-in look.

2016-09-19,Two Cookbooks Offer Fresh Approaches for Rosh Hashana,“The Gefilte Manifesto” and “Le Marais” go well beyond the usual brisket or roast chicken.,"Sometimes all it takes is one recipe to justify a new cookbook. The chicken soup in “The Gefilte Manifesto” uses chicken parts that you brown before making the soup, something I have never done. But it works, enhancing depth and color in the broth. The whole point of the book, by the founders of the Gefilteria, the inventive online Jewish food company and caterer, is reworking traditional kosher Ashkenazi cooking and preparing dishes from scratch, with recipes like an inspired kimchi-stuffed cabbage. There’s even a recipe for kosher kimchi. But the so-called apple strudel, while easy and tasty, is a deep-dish pie, not a strudel at all. Another new approach to your Rosh Hashana dinner (the observance starts the evening of Oct. 2) may come from the kosher New York steakhouse Le Marais. Consider recipes for duck cassoulet, coq au vin, slow-roasted lamb shoulder or veal braciole from this new book instead of the usual brisket or roast chicken. The chef, Mark Hennessey, explains various steak cuts and how he adapts French recipes so they conform to the kashrut: “The Gefilte Manifesto: New Recipes for Old World Jewish Foods,” by Jeffrey Yoskowitz and Liz Alpern (Flatiron Books, $35), and “Le Marais: A Rare Steakhouse … Well Done,” by Mark Hennessey and Jose Meirelles (Gefen Publishing, $29.95).",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/dining/cookbooks-rosh-hashanah-le-marais-gefilte-manifesto.html

But the media’s — and consumers’ — reaction to it are decidedly of the moment.,"Despite the fashion calendar shifting continents and an entire fashion week unfolding in the interim (London’s five-day schedule ended yesterday evening), attention is still being drawn back to New York; namely, to Marc Jacobs. Last Thursday afternoon, Jacobs unveiled his spring/summer 2017 show, to generally positive critical reviews — and a social media brouhaha. The focus was the models’ hair, braided into multicolored dreadlocks inspired by the transgender filmmaker Lana Wachowski and sourced online. The designer was subsequently accused of cultural appropriation, of lifting influences from black culture and showing them on a cast of predominantly white models. Jacobs was rapidly tried and sentenced by a public jury; a fusillade of comments rained down on Instagram and Twitter. Jacobs responded, first by “justifying” his actions and then, after that engendered further criticism, apologizing for the justification, and for any offense caused. The story had already leapt from the fashion pages: Time ran a piece, as did many other general-interest publications.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/t-magazine/fashion/marc-jacobs-dreadlocks-appropriation.html

Fox’s blockbuster drama about the Shakespearean dynamics between a family of performers, producers and businesspeople at the pinnacle of a hip-hop record label is, or was, simply very good at being a ritzy prime-time soap opera. It moved its many story lines along at breakneck speed, careening through multiple shocks and twists each episode with little of the plot-prolonging wheel-spinning endemic to the genre. For an instructive comparison, viewers should watch not just any entertaining daytime soap, but even a relatively sharp and setting-specific nighttime serial like “Gossip Girl”; the ruthless efficiency of “Empire” is unparalleled. And from corpses in cars to main characters behind bars, it always knew how to end an hour, a stretch of episodes or an entire season on a strong note.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/arts/television/empire-season-3-premiere-recap.html

Those of us who travel professionally, with a view to record for those at home our encounters on the road, try to bridge that perceptual divide. This can be uncomfortable. Tourists in bad faith, we are paid to elevate our naïve consumption (of city, museum, vista, ruin, breakfast) to the level of a vocation. The internal anxiety that this contradiction inspires in us often gets displaced, in an amusing way, onto others on the same circuit. Professional travelers like nothing better than the opportunity to point out the crumminess of other professional travelers.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/magazine/what-we-see-when-we-look-at-travel-photography.html

Marshal Henri Pétain is back in the provisional capital after a visit to the Alpine province of Savoy, and Jacques Benoist-Mechin, Under Secretary of State, is on his way here from Paris. Benoist-Mechin, one of the most ardent collaborationists, has his office in Paris, where he is in fact, if not titularly, the most important representative of the Pétain government. His return to Vichy follows discussions with Otto Abetz, the German Ambassador at Paris.

2016-09-23,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"“The Hidden Life of Trees,” No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list, describes the way trees protect their young, communicate and develop communities.","Timber: “I speak for the trees,” the Lorax proclaimed. But maybe trees can speak for themselves, if we’d just shut up and listen. That’s the premise of a book by the German forest ranger Peter Wohlleben, “The Hidden Life of Trees,” that debuts at No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list and explains — in strikingly anthropomorphic terms — how trees protect their young, communicate through underground networks and develop sophisticated social communities, among other things. “When trees are really thirsty, they begin to scream,” Wohlleben writes. “If you’re out in the forest, you won’t be able to hear them, because this all takes place at ultrasonic levels.” Published last year in Germany, the book has already been a big best seller there, prompting a New York Times profile of the author last winter. (My favorite quote came not from Wohlleben — who once clarified to a German newspaper that “I don’t hug trees and I don’t talk to them” — but from a German literary critic eager to dismiss the idea that forestry was a particularly German obsession: “Yes, there’s ‘Hansel and Gretel,’ and, sure, if your marriage fails, you go for a long hike in the woods. But I don’t think Germans love their forest more than Swedes or Norwegians or Finns.”) Now that Wohlleben’s book has been translated into English, by Jane Billinghurst, other media outlets are also taking notice. “The thing that surprised me most is how social trees are,” Wohlleben told The Guardian recently. “I stumbled over an old stump one day and saw that it was still living although it was 400 or 500 years old, without any green leaf. Every living being needs nutrition. The only explanation was that it was supported by the neighbor trees via the roots with a sugar solution. . . . Trees are very interested in keeping every member of this community alive.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

This extrasolar planet, or “exoplanet,” appeared to be a Jupiter-like ball of gas and liquid with a blistering atmospheric temperature of 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit. In the two decades since, astronomers have detected more than 3,000 exoplanets. No one has yet found a replica of Earth, although Proxima b, an Earth-size planet in a temperate orbit a mere 4.2 light-years away, whose discovery was announced last month, sounds as if it could be a decent place to live.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/books/review/search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html

2016-09-23,T’s New Design & Luxury Issue: Editor’s Letter,"For this issue, we decided to take a closer look at the meaning of design and why we make certain choices.","Design is so pervasive, argues Michael Rock in his Sign of the Times essay, that it often appears as fact rather than the result of subjective decision-making. After a period of time, an idea that originally evolved from mores, habits or customs becomes so codified and ingrained that it takes on the air of inevitability. For this issue, we decided to take a closer look at the meaning of design and why we make certain choices, from the wild natural beauty of Isabel and Julian Bannerman’s garden to the fine attention to detail in the rising designer Billy Cotton’s interiors. We considered the psychological effects of design, from the standpoint of a mad collector, the young fashion designer Jonathan Anderson, to what happens when it all goes terribly wrong. Of course, we also celebrate the vast range of the designed world: teapots, interesting hairdos, clever companies, artists’ communities, fabric, paint and rugs, jewels, clothing, even plumbing. Added up, these stories are a call to see design more clearly, to appreciate what is all around us, but also to realize the delicacy of ingenuity — that none of it had to be quite this way, and yet it is. And, to recognize that if something isn’t working, we can try to design its change.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/t-magazine/ts-new-design-luxury-issue-editors-letter.html

2016-09-29,Deborah de Robertis: Shocking for a Purpose,The renegade performance artist discusses the heady ideas behind her bold acts.,"In 2014, the renegade performance artist Deborah de Robertis shocked audiences at the Musée d’Orsay by exposing her genitals in front of Gustave Courbet’s “The Origin of the World.” In January, she was arrested after staging a similar re-enactment of Manet’s “Olympia,” also at the Orsay. This month, she invited herself into two major Paris exhibitions. At the Musée Guimet, she recast herself as the model in an iconic photograph by Nobuyoshi Araki, dressing as a geisha and gorging on a watermelon placed between her legs. Then, at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, she was arrested after crashing an exhibition devoted to “Barbie,” appearing in a plastic costume that reimagined the classic doll as a symbol of 21st-century feminism, with articulated nipples, pubic hair, a nose ring and Go-Pro camera strapped to her head. While some dismiss these unsanctioned appearances as shameless provocations, the Luxembourg-born Ms. De Robertis, 32, sees her work in the tradition of guerrilla performance artists like Valie Export and Andrea Fraser. In the following edited interview, she discusses the heady ideas behind her bold acts, and the very diverse reactions they elicit — from ferocious criticism to rapturous applause.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/arts/international/deborah-de-robertis-shocking-for-a-purpose.html

It’s also a true-crime story, the highly detailed procedural chronicle of how, on April 20, 2010, 11 people were killed and a vast marine ecosystem was despoiled because of negligence and greed. Like “The Big Short,” this film, directed by Peter Berg, dramatizes a broadly familiar story and stands as a work of popular narrative for an age of corporate impunity.
