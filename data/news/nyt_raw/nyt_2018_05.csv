It was only a matter of time before his published thoughts about lying and its corrosive effects on politics and society would be gathered together for our worried, contemporary mind. THE GREAT NEW YORK SUBWAY MAP By Emiliano Ponzi. (Museum of Modern Art, $19.95.) We forget that such an everyday object like the New York City subway map was once actually a feat of graphic design. This illustrated book, intended for children but informative for all, reminds us of Massimo Vignelli’s great innovation. THE WORLD-ENDING FIRE By Wendell Berry. (Counterpoint, $26.) Berry, the defender of rural American lands and communities, holds on fiercely to a dying way of life in this collection of essays. He rails against the mass-produced and tries to rally our appreciation for the natural world. TRIP By Tao Lin. (Vintage, paper, $16.) Lin, the provocateur, produces his first book-length work of nonfiction, an exploration of psychedelic drugs and the realizations they opened up for him. ROOTED COSMOPOLITANS By James Loeffler. (Yale, $32.50.) This year marks two 70th anniversaries: Israel’s birth and the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Loeffler reminds us how entwined the two events were — both for the role Jews played in codifying human rights and for how Zionism was buoyed by these new international values.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/books/review/new-noteworthy-stephanie-saul.html

They navigate by taste and smell. They respond to the sound of fat sizzling against a piece of fish, or the sight of a shallot turning golden in the heat. When they’re happy with the food, they jot down a few notes, then cook the dish again and again until it can be made by rote. The people who work for them watch and listen and smell and taste until they can do the same — professional cooking is about apprenticeship and technique. Most line cooks don’t receive formal recipes from which to cook. They get battlefield instruction for soldiers new to the front, sauce-stained cards scribbled with notes: sweat in rondeau, drop; roast, save fond; arroser fish; crash jus with stock.

Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain.

Later this month, a $150 million Modigliani will go on sale at Sotheby’s in New York, a highlight of a spring auction season that Bloomberg has already predicted “is poised to be the biggest on record.” The rise of this commercial aristocracy has become something of a philosophical dilemma for many in the art world: People seem more interested in money than art itself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/t-magazine/art/sean-kelly-collect-wisely.html

Shults, 56, who had wanted to fly since she was a teenager, first tried to enlist in the Air Force and was turned down. She was instead commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and served first as an instructor pilot for the T-2 Buckeye, a training aircraft for student aviators, and then flew as an A-7 Corsair pilot. When her squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet, then the Navy’s newest fighter jet, Shults was one of the first women to pilot it. But because she was a woman, Shults was prevented from joining a combat squadron, and so she transferred to the Reserve in 1993. Shults then started working for Southwest Airlines as a commercial pilot. Two days after Shults left active duty, the Navy asked the Clinton administration to allow women to fly in combat assignments.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/magazine/women-pilots-military.html

The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles farther west. And the phrase “favorable weather conditions” here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain.

Nearly always, my companions and I were the only visitors; the staff, who combined the roles of receptionist, curator, docent and locker-up-at-night, appeared faintly shellshocked that anyone had stopped by at all. Much later, I remembered a word that best describes these museums: wunderkammer, a cabinet of curiosities, the dinky and congested collections of objects that were once so popular in Europe.

The patient was a middle-aged man who was born with a leaky valve at the root of his aorta, the wide-bored blood vessel that arcs out of the human heart and carries blood to the upper and lower reaches of the body. That faulty valve had been replaced several years ago but wasn’t working properly and was leaking again. To fix the valve, the cardiac surgeon intended to remove the old tissue, resecting the ring-shaped wall of the aorta around it. He would then build a new vessel wall, crafted from the heart-lining of a cow, and stitch a new valve into that freshly built ring of aorta. It was the most exquisite form of human tailoring that I had ever seen.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/magazine/surgical-checklists-save-lives-but-once-in-a-while-they-dont-why.html

When 250,000 people gathered for the 1963 March on Washington, or nearly a million showed up for the 1982 anti-nukes rally in Central Park, it symbolized a certain power and legitimacy, a collective coming-of-age. A major protest presented a huge organizational challenge, and pulling one off delivered a potent message: Here was a force to be reckoned with. ¶ Today, the mass protest is often seen as a beginning, not an end — a moment of “bursting onto the scene, but only the first stage in a potentially long journey,” as the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci writes in her 2017 book, “Twitter and Tear Gas.” Getting people onto the streets remains difficult and time-consuming, but in the era of social media, it’s far easier than it once was. Now the real challenge comes after the grand event: Will the passion of the crowd translate into a “movement” capable of being sustained over the long term? ¶ That’s the question being asked of the many and varied protest efforts that have sprung up in recent months. “The Parkland Teens Started Something,” a Washington Post headline noted in mid-April. “How Can",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/magazine/when-does-a-moment-turn-into-a-movement.html

2018-05-16,The Secret Atelier Behind a Roman Boutique,The owners of the Roman design boutique Chez Dédé create a private space where creativity can run wild.,"Rome is a city of pockets and alcoves. Strolling its streets, you catch glimpses of intimate spaces that exist just beyond the public facades: wisteria-draped courtyards, ivy-shrouded archways, begonias spilling from terraces. These hints of private realms beckon most alluringly from the Tiber River-adjacent Regola neighborhood, known since the Renaissance as the center for mercantile activities from plate-making to leather-stitching. It’s here, in a space in the historic Palazzo Capponi Antonelli, a 16th-century building with a pebbled cortile and a stone fountain, that the boutique Chez Dédé sells the best of contemporary Italian artisanry. In the ground-floor boutique, whose walls are hung with posters drawn by co-owner Andrea Ferolla, a 56-year-old fashion illustrator and creative director, items are arranged in inviting tableaus — a retail version of the ideal Roman home. The brand’s own patterned canvas carryalls sit atop velvet-upholstered couches, and the living room’s lampshades are sewn from vintage Arjumand’s World wallpaper; the vanity’s shelves are lined with Linda Rodin’s perfume; and beyond that, there is a closet dedicated to robes, dresses and coats by the Italian line Giuliva Heritage Collection. “I wanted to show how objects could inform each other,” says co-owner Daria Reina, a 48-year-old photographer and creative director who, with Ferolla, opened the shop three years ago. (Like many respectable creative duos, the two had a scandalous affair before becoming a couple 16 years ago, back when Reina was freelancing at an agency where Ferolla was a creative director.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/t-magazine/design/chez-dede-boutique-atelier.html

After coating pasta with tomato-rich meat sauce, my mom would drizzle the bottom of a nonstick pot with oil and put it all back in to form a dark crust of tangled noodles. Once she unmolded it at the table like a cake, my brothers and I would excitedly cut into it, verbally laying claim to our preferred pieces.

2018-05-24,8 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"In a sense, all books are black box flight data recorders: They put us at the scene and grant us access to conversations and events we couldn’t otherwise witness, even when the flights in question are only (or “only”) flights of fancy. But the metaphor is especially apt for this week’s list of recommended titles, which includes Rachel Slade’s “Into the Raging Sea” — a true-life disaster tale that’s heavily informed by the actual black box recovered from the wreck of the cargo ship El Faro. Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (“The Girl Who Smiled Beads”), unexpected motherhood (“And Now We Have Everything”) and Eleanor Roosevelt’s relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (“White Houses”). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern world’s biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor. As with El Faro, the best thing about black boxes is their ability to resurrect the dead.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/books/review/8-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html
