But most of the time, chants are familiar songs that have been adapted: “You might take a melody from a song you like, and you might just mess around with the words.” For example, fans of the Shamrock Rovers, a soccer club in the League of Ireland Premier Division, changed the chorus of Lykke Li’s song “I Follow Rivers” to “I, I, follow/I follow you, Shamrock Rovers.” (The same club has also been known to chant the lyrics to “Build Me Up Buttercup” without changing the lyrics at all. “They didn’t have their own home ground, the club went through all these hardships and the lyrics spoke to the hardships of the club,” Jack says.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/magazine/how-to-start-a-soccer-chant.html

Ms. Coates will be joined by Ms. Demers and the dancers Lacina Coulibaly, Iréne Hultman and Jon Kinzel — and the music director Will Orzo.

Many others featured music by strong female vocalists, such as Nina Simone’s “Funkier Than a Mosquito’s Tweeter” at Mara Hoffman and an all-out dance party to Christina Aguilera’s “What a Girl Wants” at Brandon Maxwell.

On a wide field, men are stooped over in agricultural labor. The field stretches a great distance back, ending in a line of trees that marks out the horizon. The men working the field are dressed all in white. They have long white sacks on their backs and white hats on their heads. It’s hard to tell exactly how many of them there are, perhaps just under three dozen, but the four or five in front are distinct. These men in front, in addition to being dressed similarly, are stooped in unison. Their faces are very dark, devoid of detail. It cannot be said with certainty that they are black men (they could simply be caught in deep daytime shadow), but they very likely are.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/a-photograph-never-stands-alone.html

But to the journalists who cover it, it has always been something like something else: a sport. Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. “The kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform,” he wrote. “The quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form.” The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise “journalistic conscience”; it had internalized a “racehorse philosophy.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/if-everything-can-be-weaponized-what-should-we-fear.html

Ticking off reasons ranging from his promise of a Muslim ban to his flirtation with Vladimir Putin, Wittes stressed Trump’s propensity for promising outcomes through force of personality rather than policies and programs. “In the national security space, it is a particularly pernicious lie,” he concluded. “Our tools are too dangerous.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/how-lawfare-hit-the-big-time.html

An officer then escorts him to the toilet and signs a notebook that Maher carries, authorizing his release until 6 that evening. Maher walks a mile to his apartment — “It is my only exercise,” he said — in the Third Settlement, a grid of dun-colored tenements at the edge of the desert. After breakfast with his wife and two small children, he takes care of chores aimed at rebuilding his life — renewing his driver’s license, reactivating his cellphone; he visits friends and family and searches for a job in civil engineering, his occupation before he was clapped into prison. Whatever he does, he must be back at the police station before sundown. “Every second now is important,” said Maher, a slight 36-year-old with a full beard, large eyes obscured behind tinted yellow lenses and a gray woolen ski cap that covered his bald pate. “If I want to visit my mother in Maadi, I can spend three hours getting there and back.” The clock is ticking. “If I delay for 15 minutes, the police have the right to send me back to prison,” he said.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/magazine/how-egypts-activists-became-generation-jail.html

He designed showrooms for Esprit and seminal furniture for Knoll and housewares for Alessi. After Memphis disbanded in 1987, Sottsass dreamed up this vanity, first introduced in 1991 but surprisingly relevant today.

Past a leather-trimmed bar called Jacques (as in the artist Jacques Majorelle, whose gardens are a treasure of Marrakesh, Morocco), the restaurant has 75 or so seats, about 20 of them in a compact, skylit garden, and a comfortable library/lounge with a fireplace is adjacent to the dining room. Charles Masson, one of the city’s rare guardians of classic French cuisine and service, will run the restaurant. And, with Christian Delouvrier consulting and Mr. Masson’s input, the chef, Mario Fortuna, is creating a menu he described as marrying traditional French with the Mediterranean, even crossing the sea for an occasional taste of Morocco, with a tagine. Highlights include a rich onion tart, warm sausage with potatoes, risotto of wild mushrooms, bass with Champagne and caviar, and steak au poivre. There will be tableside service for carving a chicken for two and finishing a baba au rhum. The pastry chef, David Carmichael, will produce breads from grains milled in-house. “You can’t beat fresh flour for nutrition,” he said. A bar menu has lighter fare like chicken liver mousse and ceviche, but it’s not above offering a hamburger.

The exhibition revisits the human ordeal of World War II through previously unknown images of life in one of the many ghettos the Nazis built to isolate Jews and streamline deportation to concentration camps. These images reflect the determination of Henryk Ross, a talented Polish Jewish photojournalist and a rare Lodz Ghetto survivor, to document what he called “our martyrdom.” Between 1940 and 1944, Ross took carefully staged fictions of ghetto life that served as Nazi propaganda, but he also secretly recorded the grim realities of what truly happened. As the war wound down, he buried 6,000 negatives in the ghetto, returning after Germany’s surrender to find half intact. Ross eventually moved to Canada, where he died at 81 in 1991. In 2007, the Archive of Modern Conflict donated all of his negatives and contact prints to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which organized this exhibition.

The score is Richard Strauss’s “Schlagobers” (1924) — surely until now the most generally forgotten ballet music by a major composer.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/arts/dance/review-alexei-ratmansky-whipped-cream-american-ballet-theater.html

Spruill’s “Divided We Stand” (the story of the National Women’s Conference of 1977 and its aftermath), and Tressie McMillan Cottom’s “Lower Ed” (a deep dive into students who attend for-profit colleges). Iconic buildings don’t just spring up either, as Wendy Lesser’s engaging biography of the architect Louis Kahn makes clear. Philosophy takes time too: in the 35 years’ worth of essays and fragments that make up “Other People: Takes and Mistakes,” David Shields establishes himself as a funny, vulnerable and humane 21st-century Socrates.

So just as our primal brain is wired to relish solving puzzles as an extension of more dire problems of survival, we must have a deep connection to the notion of the cliffhanger.

I suppose it’s not a purely malevolent urge; after all, I’d have totally appreciated it if, in my past life as a Neanderthal, I was told that the saber-toothed tigers had recently moved to a cave on my polished-rock delivery route, and therefore I could work from home that day.

Through never-before-seen footage and interviews with her friends and admirers, the film revisits Jacobs’s midcentury battle with New York City planner Robert Moses. Where Moses privileged governmental power (and his own), Jacobs favored preservation and the natural order of neighborhood life. In perhaps her greatest victory, she and her followers protested — singing a song Bob Dylan co-wrote for the cause — and ultimately halted Moses’s proposed construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have cut through SoHo and Little Italy and altered New York as we know it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/t-magazine/design/jane-jacobs-documentary-matt-tyrnauer.html

A two-level restaurant serving Mexican food in a shiny new office building is hardly cookie-cutter Midtown, but Mr. Stupak is counting on his approach to the cuisine, filled unapologetically with American and other influences — he makes no claim to authenticity — appealing to the Midtown set. “Everyone told me that I had to have a shrimp cocktail in Midtown,” he said. “I didn’t think so.” Instead, his freewheeling menu offers starters like crab nachos with sea urchin, chopped cabbage salad with toasted dried fava bean dressing, and nine different tacos, including a falafel one and another with spit-roasted beef that is a take on al pastor. “We’re using tacos as a gateway drug to get people to try other stuff,” he said. Some larger plates, including roasted red prawns with chipotle, and fajitas with black pepper mole, round out the choices. The design for the 150-seat space, by Glen Coben in collaboration with Mr. Stupak, is airy and bright, with a big bar area and a more intimate dining room and open kitchen beyond. Upstairs, there are tables on the overhanging balcony and several private rooms. All are adorned with Mexican art pieces.

The restlessness of “ReComposed” pays tribute to the vivid hues and bold brush strokes of Joan Mitchell, an American abstract expressionist artist whose paintings can seem like whirlwinds of color. And “Possession” is inspired by the changing relationships in A. S. Byatt’s novel of the same name, in which two contemporary literary scholars find themselves increasingly caught up in the emotional predicaments of the two Victorian poets whose personal lives they are researching.

Don’t overdo it.,"“Find out why your resting heart rate is so high in the first place,” says Dr. John Elefteriades, who directs the Aortic Institute at Yale University. Someone struggling with heart or lung problems, for example, will have an elevated pulse that needs to be corrected immediately with medicine. But even with no serious health problems, lowering the number of times your heart beats in a minute can decrease its burden. Once you determine your resting heart rate by making several measurements — count the beats for 30 seconds, then double that number — start exercising regularly for a long period of time. “If you’re a couch potato, your pulse rate might go up just by doing normal activities,” Elefteriades says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/magazine/how-to-lower-your-heart-rate.html

Not just because you likely haven’t heard of it, but because there isn’t anywhere to stay. But it now comes highly recommended by locals for its growing food scene and small-town vibes despite steady gentrification. It’s home to more than a few hipster and creative types, and on one quiet corner sits a charming restaurant to rival any Brooklyn eatery: Wm. Mulherin’s Sons, which gets its name from the 19th-century whisky bottling and blending company that once occupied the space. Nearly every ingredient on its menu is made in-house, right down to the flour blends for the homemade pizza crusts. (Bon Appétit named it one of the 50 best restaurants to open in 2016.) And now, you can sleep upstairs — in one of the four chic rooms Wm. Mulherin’s Sons just opened as a hotel. They’re uniquely designed (and stocked with things like Kinfolk magazine and Aesop toiletries), and perfectly sized for longer stays (with full kitchens and even washing machines). The rooms are conveniently located above Wm. Mulherin’s Sons (for nightcaps) and around the corner from the La Colombe flagship (for morning coffee.) The most exciting part of your stay might just be checking in: Like at any old seaside pub, keys are simply doled out by anyone working the bar, so you can grab a pint before heading up to your room.

In an effort to make the game more manly and scientific, members of the Knickerbocker Club, New York’s most influential team, proposed that “the ball must weigh not less than 6 nor more than 6¼ ounces avoirdupois” and that “no person shall be permitted to approach or to speak with the referee, umpires or players, or in any manner to interrupt or interfere during the progress of the game.” Most significant was the rule that changed the terms of victory. The winner was no longer the first team to score 21 runs, but the one that accrued the most runs after the end of nine innings. The reasoning behind the change was simple and logical: Fielding, which had been a stone-handed disaster during baseball’s earliest days, had improved rapidly, making it hard for any one team to reach 21 before the sun went down. The modern nine-inning game was one of the first official attempts to make baseball games go faster.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/magazine/as-baseball-considers-change-it-should-look-to-its-past.html

","The brothers Jacob and Axel Hagg moved to Los Angeles from New York in 2012 — and a year later, they launched their brand, Brashy Studios. “There was and is a creative opportunity in creating a new women’s streetwear line not present in the men’s market,” says Jacob, who first moved from Stockholm to New York to intern for a creative agency before decamping to the West Coast. The brothers draw inspiration from the deep corners of the internet — as well as from people they find on Instagram, like the musical artist Tommy Genesis, an underground female rapper known for her rebellious attitude and lyrics. Though Brashy is geared toward female customers, some pieces in the collection — such as oversize hoodies, boxy jackets and roomy trousers — are intentionally gender-fluid. “For us, streetwear should incorporate something of an anti-establishment ethos; establishment can of course be freely interpreted,” Jacob says. The brand’s spring/summer 2017 collection — which is available now at Colette in Paris and on the Brashy Studios website — consists of a fluorescent-pink vinyl jacket and pants, a tearaway tracksuit and pieces emblazoned with the word “GIRLS.” ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/t-magazine/brashy-studios-mademe-unravel-streetwear-womens-fashion.html

They were bright crimson affairs, perhaps familiar to those who have spent time eating in the islands of the Bahamas and Lesser Antilles. Doramae ginned them up from canned goods and fresh conchs, lobster, sometimes chicken or pork shipped in from Nassau, and served them on a small table in her brother’s kitchen.

I heard she has a smartphone and has been going to museums.” So even though the term is burdened with the yoke of the very thing they are trying to flee, members remain huddled together under “O.T.D.” on their blogs and in their Facebook groups, where their favored hashtag is #itgetsbesser — besser meaning “better” in Yiddish. Sometimes someone will pop up on a message board or in an email group and say, “Shouldn’t we decide to call ourselves something else?” But it never takes.

But on what? Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk.” Simonds seems to have taken his advice, becoming drunk on her capacity to make poetry through metaphor. Drunk as well on a temporary freedom from domestic responsibility, she addresses throughout the long poem a companion of indeterminate gender, Felix, whose name in Latin means happy.

But to confront your story’s limitations head-on and admit it’s better suited to 20 pages than 220 pages can be a painful reckoning — though, as I tell my students, not nearly as painful as trying to spread a ho-hum back story into a thin layer across a whole book.
