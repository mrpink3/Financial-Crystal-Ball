2014-09-02,David Lynch’s Doughnut Obsession,"The first major retrospective of the filmmaker’s work opens this month in Philadelphia, where Federal Donuts will serve up sugary confections as an homage to his films.","Trippy dream sequences. Doppelgängers. Laura Dern. One associates them all with the fun-house mirror maze of a David Lynch project. But doughnuts? From Special Agent Dale Cooper’s insatiable sweet tooth on “Twin Peaks” to the metaphor Lynch uses in the 2012 documentary “Meditation, Creativity, Peace” (“Transcendental Meditation gives an experience much sweeter than the sweetness of this doughnut”), sugary fried rings have popped up throughout the filmmaker’s cabalistic canon. And so, Michael Solomonov, the chef and co-owner of Philadelphia’s Federal Donuts, jumped at the invite to make confections in honor of the first major retrospective of Lynch’s work, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (where Lynch studied painting in the late ’60s). With names like Blue Velvet and Good Coffee — a “Twin Peaks” reference — Solomonov’s creations are an homage to the master of magical realist cinema. There’s one, though, that won’t see the light of day: the David Lynch. “I would have done a little clove and allspice, to get at the Indian-mystical thing, and a bit of malt powder since he used to have a daily milkshake,” Solomonov says. “Plus a healthy dose of windowpane LSD.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/david-lynchs-doughnut-obsession/

You can’t avoid it, so you may as well embrace it, and find out what you should be ready to discuss during cocktail parties and water cooler conversations everywhere. Indubitably, questions of geopolitics and the stagnant European economy are more important, but think of it this way: What happens at fashion week will inform in large part the shape — literally — your identity will take six months from now.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program, considered the most influential guide to hundreds of species of popular fish, on Monday issued a report encouraging consumers to eat 21 species of rockfish it had long warned cooks to avoid.

The revival of the fisheries began in earnest in 2000, when they were near collapse and fishing families were facing bankruptcy. A series of quotas, improvements in gear, better monitoring of catches and the creation of protected areas to preserve fish habitat brought improvements in stocks off the shores of California, Washington and Oregon, said Frank Lockhart of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s West Coast fisheries division.

But what causes such fear and consternation is another feature of the ISIS regime: The public statements of the ISIS authorities make it clear that the principal task of state power is not the regulation of the welfare of the state’s population (health, the fight against hunger) — what really matters is religious life and the concern that all public life obey religious laws. This is why ISIS remains more or less indifferent toward humanitarian catastrophes within its domain — its motto is roughly “take care of religion and welfare will take care of itself.” Therein resides the gap that separates the notion of power practiced by ISIS from the modern Western notion of what Michel Foucault called “biopower,” which regulates life in order to guarantee general welfare: the ISIS caliphate totally rejects the notion of biopower.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/isis-is-a-disgrace-to-true-fundamentalism/

In his early days, Ellroy wandered through the boneyards of 1980s pulp, channeling Jim Thompson and Dashiell Hammett before he found his own voice with a trilogy of contemporary novels about a troubled, racist genius cop named Lloyd Hopkins. Hopkins was morally despicable in the day-to-day, but compared with the monsters he fought in the neon-drench of underworld Los Angeles, he was quasi-­angelic. When Ellroy closed out the Hopkins trilogy with “Suicide Hill” in 1986, he shuttered his interest in topical culture as well and moved into the second incarnation of his career, that of the wildly romantic yet increasingly bilious chronicler of Los Angeles in the years immediately following World War II.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/books/review/james-ellroys-perfidia.html

Her “Eichmann in Jerusalem” in many ways mirrored Eichmann’s own self-presentation. She insisted that, contrary to expectations, the man in the dock was not some kind of demonic Nazi sadist but a thoughtless, relatively anonymous, nonideological bureaucrat dutifully executing orders for the emigration, deportation and murder of European Jewry.

Dressed in t-shirts and looking laid-back as usual, the pair talked about exploring distant horizons with their prints and patterns, and the casual appeal of their debut shoe collection (“they’re really meant to be an extension of a summer shoe,” Gabier said, glancing at the sporty slip-ons at his feet). The models’ hair and makeup evoked the same breezy vibe. “Everything is relaxed and easy, with a certain softness to it,” Peters said. During casting earlier this week, on a day marked with humidity and thunderclouds, the makeup artist James Boehmer noted the natural flush evident on everyone’s skin. So instead of using bronzer on the cheeks, he dabbed on the new Nars Lipstick in Ligueria (out this spring) to recreate that moment. “This gives you that overheated effect,” he explained, tapping in the golden beige pigments. Outside the show, where the temperature was in the low 80s, the same tawny glow was easy to spot.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2015-creatures-of-the-wind-nars-backstage-beauty-report/

2014-09-05,What’s on TV Friday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) SAVING MR. BANKS (2013) Tom Hanks stars as Walt Disney in this Disney movie about the making of a Disney movie: specifically “Mary Poppins,” which, at the time of its creation in the early ’60s, was the most expensive live-action film the studio had produced. Eventually it became one of the most beloved, too, and one of the biggest moneymakers. Emma Thompson (above, with Mr. Hanks) is the author P. L. Travers, who conjured the magical nanny, and is something of a crank. “I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons,” she says of her creation, stiffly, lips pursed. There’s a back story too, in which Travers is a little girl (Annie Rose Buckley) in a dusty town in Australia, where her hopelessly alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) can barely hold on to his bank job. “Fans of the book and the earlier movie will know that Mr. Banks is the father of the children cared for by Mary Poppins, but even those entirely innocent of her previous literary and cinematic incarnations — if such people exist — will find this movie accessible and enjoyable,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this movie directed by John Lee Hancock. “That is part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

She wants the sort of bland, decorous WASP name that will label her as an unhyphenated American.

2014-09-05,Inside the List,"With Ebola back in the news, readers are returning to Richard Preston’s scientific adventure story “The Hot Zone,” which is No. 17 on the paperback nonfiction list.","Going Viral: Twenty years ago, Richard Preston scored a nonfiction hit with his scientific adventure story “The Hot Zone,” about an outbreak of Ebola virus among quarantined monkeys in Virginia — the book spent almost two years on the hardcover and paperback lists before fading away in June 1996. (That was a good time for science journalism. During its run, Preston’s book shared space on the list with Oliver Sacks’s collection of neurological case studies “An Anthropologist on Mars” and Nicholas Negroponte’s technology primer “Being Digital,” which predicted the end of fax machines and CD-ROMs.) Now, with Ebola back in the news because of its fatal spread through West Africa, readers are returning to “The Hot Zone.” The Associated Press reported last month that Anchor Books, the paperback publisher, had printed 70,000 new copies, and the book is currently at No. 17 in its 50th week on the paperback nonfiction list. “The thing is,” Preston told CNN early in August, “Ebola has been pulling surprises on all of us. I don’t think anybody really expected that Ebola had the potential to do something like get into the cities and get out of control. But, you know, most of the experts I’m talking to are saying that they are pretty well convinced that, you know, they will be able to get it under control, but there’s huge concern about the possibility that Ebola could get into a major city.” The virus’s return is obviously bad news. But it does retroactively absolve “The Hot Zone” of a charge Colin Harrison leveled against it in the Book Review a few years after its publication. “The outbreak in Virginia resulted in exactly zero human cases,” Harrison noted, complaining about the “happy frenzy” of media attention the story had received. “It was the first time that everyone knew about a disease that nobody had. It was the first time that a virus was famous for being famous.” Now we know we were right to panic.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/books/review/inside-the-list.html

We have decisively changed the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the rate of extinction. We have created ­new atomic isotopes and plastiglomerates that may persist for millions of years. We have built mega­cities that will leave a durable footprint long after they have vanished. We have altered the pH of the oceans and have moved so many life-forms around the globe — inadvertently and ­intentionally — that we are creating novel ecosystems everywhere. Since the late-18th-century industrialization that marks the Anthropocene’s beginnings, humans have ­shaken Earth’s life systems with a profundity that the paleontologist Anthony Barnosky has likened to an asteroid strike.

2014-09-05,Girlhood Gone,Sex and cruelty are tools a 14-year-old uses to cope with a devastatingly irresponsible father in 1970s Greenwich Village.,"It seems endemic to the enterprise that fiction writers must fall good and hard for their characters — how else could we stand to live with them for weeks, months, years, in sometimes tortuous isolation? As in marriage or a long affair, this abiding attraction can twist and turn into revulsion or obsession. It can also wax and wane. The writer can stray and then beg for forgiveness, banging on a shut door to be let back inside. In conjuring “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” Mark Twain became captivated by Huckleberry Finn, Tom’s “idle and lawless and vulgar and bad” sidekick, so much so that Twain rode Huck on to glory with his subsequent masterpiece. J. D. Salinger’s beloved Holden Caulfield appeared in several stories, both published and unpublished, before he found his home in “The Catcher in the Rye.” And, as any fan knows, Salinger had a hell of a time kicking the Glass family to the curb; its members own or make appearances in all three of Salinger’s story collections, as well as in new collections (fingers crossed) that are rumored to be ­forthcoming.

2014-09-05,Impossible Mirrors,A Brooklyn-based narrator preoccupied with identity decides to help his best friend have a child.,"Early in “10:04,” Ben Lerner’s frequently brilliant second novel, the central character — a refraction or avatar of this ­Brooklyn-based author — describes visiting the Metropolitan Museum with a female friend: “We often visited weekday afternoons, since Alex was unemployed, and I, a writer.” Together they look at a melodramatic 19th-century genre painting of Joan of Arc, which the narrator claims is one of his favorite pictures. Lerner uses the strikingly unlovely word “coconstructed” to describe the shared nature of their experience: “We would work out our views as we coconstructed the literal view before us.” A few paragraphs on, he and an 8-year-old boy are seen “coconstructing a shoe-box diorama.” Later he can be found letting an Occupy protester shower in his apartment, wondering if it’s possible to “coconstruct a world in which moments can be something other than the elements of profit.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/books/review/1004-by-ben-lerner.html

Laila Lalami recounts the voyage — and its brutal aftermath — in her new novel, “The Moor’s Account,” from the perspective of Estebanico, a ­Moroccan slave of one of the explorers. It’s a fictional memoir, told in a controlled voice that feels at once historical and contemporary, that seeks to offer a truer account of the expedition than the official (and hopelessly biased) version of events provided by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, one of the other three survivors.

Birth defects and cancer rates have soared; houses have been abandoned and razed. Now, years later, a peculiar collective amnesia has set in, and only one woman is still fighting the City Council, which has cleared the land for redevelopment, and the predictably sleazy real estate magnate who will profit from the job.

2014-09-05,Minority Report,A journalist examines Asian-American manhood and the cultural stereotypes that shaped his coming-of-age.,"There’s nothing subtle or coy or particularly evocative about the title of “Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self,” a memoir by the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Alex Tizon. In fact, the title is so straightforward that when I was asked to write this review, I felt vaguely offended by the idea that my editor would push such an obvious identity-politics project on me, perhaps believing that I, by dint of being “Asian-American,” must therefore have some special insight into Tizon and this search for his Asian self. I am 20 years younger than Tizon and grew up in snooty college towns and attended schools where I was taught that there was a hierarchy of race writing. The immigrant experience was not enough in itself, and when I read the self-evident title of Tizon’s book, I flashed back to a fiction workshop in ­Columbia’s M.F.A. program and a ­professor who told me that the book I was working on — a book much like Tizon’s — could “definitely be published,” but wondered if there was anything I could do to elevate it into something more “interesting.” I recognized the code immediately — anything labeled “the immigrant experience” would be considered earnest and déclassé, and would therefore need to be gussied up in fashionable literary frills. For the next year, I wrote bad evocations of Lydia Davis, Lorrie Moore, Barthelme and Borges. My protagonists, God help them, became whiter and whiter.

Louise Penny, who sets her enchanting stories in a sheltered Quebec village she calls Three Pines, keeps inventing new ways to avoid the inevitable reckoning. In THE LONG WAY HOME (Minotaur, $27.99), she makes the task more challenging by putting her detective out to pasture. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache has retired from the Sûreté du Québec to live a contemplative life, enjoying the company of his eccentric neighbors and hoping to be anointed with the “balm in Gilead” that will “make the wounded whole” and “cure a sin-sick soul.” Gamache is moved by the plight of one neighbor, Clara Morrow, a painter whose husband, Peter, left home when her artistic reputation eclipsed his own — promising to return in exactly one year, presumably after intense soul-searching. But that anniversary has come and gone without any word, and Clara is afraid Peter’s in terrible trouble, might even be dead. Clutching at a few meager clues, the most intriguing being some atrocious paintings Peter sent to his sister’s child, Gamache and Clara follow the lost artist’s perilous journey to find himself.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/books/review/louise-pennys-the-long-way-home-and-more.html

It was puzzling until Kendal explained what she was doing. “The cream takes off some of the liner and leaves a beautiful residue and sheen on the lid,” she said. “This gives you that soft, dewy effect.” Another surprise: dabbing on Lancôme Aquatique Waterproof Eyecolour Base in Sienne, a brown primer of sorts, in lieu of eye shadow to define the eyes, without being obvious about it. The final look hinted at the cool, smoldering gaze of Kendal’s muse-of-the-moment: British actress Charlotte Rampling.

The Ministry of Health said that 70 people had been found infected with the dengue virus in the past week, in what it called the first outbreak in Japan since 1945. Dengue, which causes fevers and in rare cases death, is common in tropical climates, but not in temperate Japan. Officials said global warming might be playing a role in the spread of dengue to places like Tokyo. This year, Japan had an unusually hot and humid summer. The ministry said most of the people found infected had spent time in or near Yoyogi Park, where they were most likely bitten by mosquitoes that carried the disease. On Friday, health workers sprayed pesticides in the park to kill the insects. No one has died in the outbreak.

(HBO) 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) In this Oscar winner for best picture, written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, above, portrays Solomon Northup, a free African-American man who, in 1841, was kidnapped in Washington and sold into slavery. Paul Giamatti plays the brutish Louisiana trader who sells Solomon to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a seemingly decent plantation owner, who in turn sells him to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a drunken madman, who epitomizes the villainy of slave ownership. Lupita Nyong’o won a best supporting actress Oscar for her turn as Patsey, Epp’s favorite, whom he brutalizes. “Mr. McQueen’s sympathies are as unqualified as his control,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “There is much to admire about ‘12 Years a Slave,’ including the cleareyed, unsentimental quality of its images — this is a place where trees hang with beautiful moss and black bodies — and how Mr. Ejiofor’s restrained, open, translucent performance works as a ballast, something to cling onto, especially during the frenzies of violence.” And while these scenes are hard to watch, “the genius of ‘12 Years a Slave’ is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2014-09-07,The Trick Behind the Sporty Ponytails at Alexander Wang,The hairstylist Guido Palau put a high-gloss spin on the classic gymnasium ‘do.,"Athletic shoes have a cultish appeal among fashion designers, and it would seem that beauty pros are similarly obsessed. Backstage at Alexander Wang this afternoon, both the hair and makeup teams talked about trainers as the inspiration behind the slicked-back, sporty looks given to the models. “It started with a fetish about sneakers,” said the makeup artist Diane Kendal of her conversation with the designer. “There were references to Stan Smith, Michael Jordan, New Balance.” The hairstylist Guido Palau ran with that concept, putting a new spin on the classic gymnasium ponytail. “It’s a bit futuristic,” he said of the low-slung style. “The tail is dry but there is a high gloss to the head.” Palau’s technique involved tightly combing back strands with generous amounts of Redken Hardwear 16 Super Strong Hair Gel around the crown, then misting Redken Diamond Oil High Shine Airy Mist (available in October) all over to provide a glistening effect. To finish, he secured hair with a simple black tie at the nape. “I can’t really move my neck too much!” joked the model Mari of the ultra-sleek result. Still, she proved to be a good sport. “But I can’t wait to see how it will look on the runway.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/the-trick-behind-the-sporty-ponytails-at-alexander-wang/

These researches have not yet arrived at a sufficiently advanced stage to convince Dr. Brown-Séquard that any practical application can be made in this direction at present, but several women have already called upon Dr. Brown-Séquard, and offered themselves as subjects for these inoculations.  — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 8, 1889",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/1889-research-may-help-prolong-womens-fertility/

2014-09-07,1914: French Press Misjudges U.S. Ambassadors,The local press speculated about postings at the American Embassy in Paris in 1914.,"Judging from their comments, some of the French newspapers take a rather erroneous view of the arrival in Paris of Mr. W. G. Sharp and Mr. Robert Bacon. The idea seems to prevail that the United States is now represented in Paris by a sort of diplomatic triumvirate. Such an idea, of course, is amusingly inaccurate. Mr. Myron T. Herrick, the American Ambassador, is in sole charge of the Embassy, and will remain in sole charge until the end of the existing crisis. Mr. W. G. Sharp, who will take over the Embassy when conditions permit Mr. Herrick to retire, is in Paris for the purpose of arranging details connected with the preparations for his residence here. As regards Mr. Bacon, who made a host of friends during his term as Ambassador, he is visiting Paris at this time on private business. The French press, in fact, in trying to read diplomatic significance into the presence in Paris of the three eminent diplomatists, is wasting its ingenuity. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 8, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/1914-french-press-misjudges-u-s-ambassadors/

2014-09-07,How to Get the Purple Hazy Eyes at Derek Lam,"For the designer’s spring/summer 2015 runway, the French makeup artist Tom Pecheux perfected natural violet eye makeup with layers of “bruisey” colors.","“I like when beauty has a little twist to it,” said the French makeup artist Tom Pecheux backstage this morning. When workshopping the concept behind the beauty look at Derek Lam, Pecheux tried a few different options for the designer. “The first was all natural, no makeup, blah blah,” he said. “The girl looked like a flat wheel. So I said, ‘Let’s try a nude color,’ which was pretty but boring.” Eventually the face painter grabbed a rich violet color and smudged it over the lids: et voilà, that did the trick. “Derek said, ‘Oooh, I like that!’ ” exclaimed Pecheux, with an amused smile. Still, the “bruisey” shade, as Pecheux described it, required careful application. To avoid the illusion of being punched in the face, he traced MAC Fluidline in Deep Deep Brown along the upper lashes, then brushed on MAC Lipstick in Violetta, creating a soft pinky-lavender wash over the lids and up to the brows. “The lipstick is bright, so you only need a thin layer,” he insisted. To finish, he swept on a metallic taupe eye shadow, then etched a thin streak of white kohl pencil under the eyes to lend contrast. The last step: sheering out everything with his hands. “This is your best friend,” Pecheux said, waving his finger in the air. “Using your fingers with makeup brings so much sensuality and femininity to the face, and that’s what I want for spring and summer.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2015-the-purple-haze-on-eyes-at-derek-lam/

2014-09-08,What’s On TV Monday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO Signature) BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (2013) Michael Douglas, above, in a Golden Globe-winning role, stars as Liberace, and Matt Damon is Scott Thorson, his chauffeur, lover and adopted son, in this film from the director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Set in Las Vegas; Los Angeles; and Palm Springs, Calif., the film chronicles the men’s relationship, as Liberace has Mr. Thorson cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. “There’s something uncanny, even brilliant,” about Mr. Douglas’s impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum major’s puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizard’s predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer.” Still, “a cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic,” Mr. Hale added, the film is “full of smart, funny details — perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglas’s blinding costumes — but it’s short on heart, or heat.”  ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

On the eyes, he buffed a dark pink-brown tone from the new Nars St-Paul-De-Vence Duo Eyeshadow palette over the lid, pulling the shade around the outer corners in a downward arc. “It’s inspired by how Laura does her makeup,” Kaliardos noted of the quirky technique. “She does this thing where she drags down the corner of her eye shadow, and I thought, ‘That’s kinda cool.'” Underneath, he traced a thin line of Nars Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner in Rue Bonaparte to “lift up the eyes” and dusted on a gold metallic shade for a little glitz. But the real attention-getter: the faux piercings that half the models wore on their brows. “They’re just cool facial accessories,” Kaliardos said of the silver rings adhered with glue. The model Kristina Petrosiute appreciated the (temporary) shock value. “I took a photo and sent it to my boyfriend,” she said. “He was like, ‘You look weird!’ But I like it!” For Xiao Wen Ju, the experience might even lead to some real piercings. “The eyebrow is not my style, but maybe I would do the lip,” she said. “I think the lip is really sexy.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/rodarte-eyebrows-new-york-fashion-week-beauty-trends-spring-summer-2015/

To build a tiny bit of grip and texture, he applied his Lift & Plump Volumizing Spray Mist followed by Schwarzkopf Osis+ Dust It mattifying powder, then started loosely braiding strands at the collarbone. “The hair drapes over the shoulders so it seems like that’s the length of the model’s hair,” Pita explained. Next, he blasted on dry shampoo and pulled out layers around the face, curling them with an iron for a messy, windswept feel. The look’s easy sophistication appealed to the model Maggie Rizer, who had just flown in from San Francisco, where she lives with her two toddler sons. “I love it,” she said of the unkempt braid. “It’s how my hair looks most of the time, only Orlando does it better!”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/michael-kors-braids-new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2015/

For most of us mere mortals, though, spring is really about fresh, glowing skin and effortless locks. At today’s Hugo Boss show, Jason Wu’s minimalist collection was complemented by the models’ clean, dewy makeup: nude lips, a barely-there dusting of taupe shadow.

Designed by Studio Tack of Brooklyn, the rugged-good-looks hotel offers 16 rooms with wide balconies, custom-designed Woolrich blankets (handy in the off season), Tivoli radios, barware dedicated to beer drinking and artwork that pays tribute to one of the few remaining floating lighthouses in the United States (it’s docked a few hundred feet from the building). Almost needless to say, dogs are welcome, but call if yours weighs more than 80 pounds. “We get about 1,000 people a week who visit our brewery,” said Sam Calagione, an owner. “But now we get to hang out with them for 24 hours or more, rather than just an hour.

2014-09-10,"Industrial, but With a Softer Side",Roman and Williams introduces two collections of lighting as part of its R.W. Atlas housewares line for Waterworks.,"Roman and Williams has added lighting to its R. W. Atlas housewares for Waterworks with two collections, Spunflower and Cupper. Robin Standefer, a founder of Roman and Williams, described the burnished nickel and brass lights as “fairly muscular and sturdy, but with a fine tactility.” In all, there are two pendants, two sconces and a chandelier, any of which can be described as industrial. But a closer look reveals some frills. The Spunflower pendant, for instance, has three tiers of milky white glass crowned with a rim of metal with tiny perforations. Ms. Standefer said these dots would temper any harshness. The quality of illumination in industrial fixtures is often “pure, tough and authentic,” she added, “but a light still has to be soft and beautiful.” Prices range from $1,200 to $3,500. The Cupper ceiling-mounted four-light pendant, shown, is $3,500.

Marshy basking spots for Londoners are being created in the Thames; Copenhagen already allows bathing in its harbor and the Manhattan coastline could soon have a floating cross-shaped swimming hole called +POOL. Amphitheaters, zigzagging boardwalks, and artificial hummocks surround the swimming areas, so bathers are not left vulnerable in open water. “I like the idea of these semi-wild experiences,” Ms. Withers said. The show opens to coincide with the London Design Festival, Sept. 13 to 21, but runs through Jan. 10, 2015.

Although often misunderstood and maligned, its central argument was straightforward and sensible: With the collapse of Communism, liberal democracy stood alone as the only form of government compatible with socio­-economic modernity. Over the years since, Fukuyama has continued to argue the case, and has now summed up his efforts with a two-­volume magnum opus that chronicles global political development from prehistory to the present. A quarter-century on, he remains convinced that no other political system is viable in the long run, but concludes his survey with a sobering twist: Liberal democracy’s future is cloudy, but that is because of its own internal problems, not competition from any external opponent.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/books/review/francis-fukuyamas-political-order-and-political-decay.html

Meanwhile, after an all-day session, representatives of the three major American broadcasting chains announced that they had agreed to present war news broadcasts so as to avoid “undue horror and suspense and will try to be temperate, responsible and mature in selecting material and the manner in which the facts are made public.” As far as possible, the chains said they would attempt to have the European broadcast conducted by Americans to insure the greatest degree of impartiality. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 13, 1939 ",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/1939-radio-station-charged/

I can see very clearly what each dancer is doing. It’s a way to sketch. It’s an information generator.” Last month, Harrell, who divides his year between the United States and Europe, drifted amid islands in a Berlin rehearsal space. He gave the dancers directions that ranged from the blunt — “stop doing that” — to the fanciful — “move with the smell of fashion.” This session was practice for “Practice,” a not-quite-performance that Harrell was preparing to give in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, in which he would invite spectators to spy on his creative methods. “It’s a nightmare in many ways,” he says, “because I’m very private about my process.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/how-trajal-harrell-mixes-his-moves.html

Crowds gathered when she appeared in the streets of Paris. Newspapers reported her outfit changes. Royalty asked to meet her. Traditional beauty is rarely so exciting, but hers was unorthodox: She had a long neck, a big nose and skin so uncannily white that people argued over whether it was real or fake. Theories included that she covered her entire body with makeup or strategically dosed herself with arsenic. In an era of puffy, body-swallowing gowns, she wore snug dresses that showed off her curves; she put red makeup on the tips of her ears, just for extra drama. She was rumored to be sleeping with half the men in Paris. Every painter wanted to paint her, to be the great hero who fixed her image for a culture desperate to stare at it. But art — the translation of three-dimensional life into a flat, static illusion — was an act of magic with serious consequences. In a time before mass-produced cameras, an image was a heavy thing, laborious to make and hard to distribute. Instagram was Duragram.

2014-09-12,Inside the List,"“The Secret Place,” by Tana French, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, just after the critic Laura Miller recently argued that women write the best crime novels.","Unsolved Mysteries: Do women write the best crime novels? That’s the thesis of a recent essay in Salon by the critic Laura Miller, who argues that mysteries by men have grown sclerotic and predictable — locked into a hard-boiled formula little changed since the days of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Meanwhile (Miller continues), women are mixing their crime stories with other genres, mining the emotional terrains of home and family to advance a field the editor Sarah Weinman calls “domestic suspense.” One novel that features prominently in Miller’s analysis is “The Secret Place,” by Tana French, which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. “A thin vein of the uncanny runs through most of French’s novels,” Miller notes: “mysteries that go unsolved, premises that flirt with impossibility, paranormal occurrences that may or may not be imagined.” I don’t know if Miller is right about men and women; who is? But she’s not wrong about French, whose books really do cultivate an appealing lack of resolution — at least in part, no doubt, because she jumps in without a plan. “When I start writing, I have the narrator, the basic premise and a load of coffee,” French told The Sunday Times of London in 2008. “I don’t even know ­‘whodunit.’ ” Not that she would let uncertainty keep her from a genre she loves. “Crime fiction is one of the best barometers of what’s going on at any different moment,” she added. “It’s about society’s highest priorities and deepest fears.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But the demise of the hero, and of the author, no longer needs to be the end of the story.

There seems to me too much misery in the world.” Charles Darwin’s faith was gone; he began writing “On the Origin of Species.” As Ian McEwan has told interviewers, “rather like Darwin when his favorite daughter died,” on Sept. 11 he “felt, more than ever,” that there was no God, and that “religion was distinctly unhelpful in making compassionate, reasonable judgments about people’s lives. On the whole, the secular mind seems far superior in making reasonable judgments.” In McEwan’s early novels, intelligent characters had often “slithered” along the “axis of belief and unbelief,” just as he had.

If you then said this credit boom was due to lax monetary policy, you’d still earn a healthy fraction of nods. If you then asserted that America’s departure from the gold standard caused the lax monetary policy, not many folks would be nodding. Nevertheless, this attenuated causal chain has been embraced by a motley collection of wonks, cranks and presidential candidates: Michele Bachmann, Glenn Beck, Steve Forbes, David Stockman and politicians whose last name is Paul. These gold bugs have a deep suspicion of fiat currency. They fret that governments that can just print money will be tempted to print even more, triggering inflation, currency depreciation and worse. Most citizens do not share this obsession, but they might share an unease about the dollar being backed by nothing more than a social convention to treat greenbacks as if they are worth more than the paper they are printed on.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/books/review/war-and-gold-by-kwasi-kwarteng.html

When he arrived at the border, he realized be had forgotten his passport. But police at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point recognized him and allowed him in without it.

Audiences in the United States don’t get many opportunities to see Mr. Hou’s movies on the big screen, which makes the Museum of the Moving Image’s retrospective “Also Like Life: The Films of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (through Oct. 17), essential viewing.

2014-09-13,What’s on TV Saturday,Television highlights.," 8 P.M. (HBO) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V. -positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication not then legal in the United States. Eventually, he begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicines for a monthly fee. Jared Leto (above left, with Mr. McConaughey), in another Oscar-winning performance, plays the transgendered Rayon, who becomes Ron’s business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who, after initially opposing the plan, turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and inspired by real events, “is the sense that Ron’s efforts are part of a larger movement,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Ron’s bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaughey’s disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers’ interest in the complexity of the character. But his actions unfold in something of a vacuum.” He added, “There is warmth and intelligence here, and undeniable sincerity, but also a determination, in the face of much painful and fascinating history, to play it safe.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Anderson this afternoon. Crafting such a pure look called for enhanced skin preparation involving exfoliation around the nose and on the lips and an application of M.A.C Lightful Softening Lotion to intensely hydrate the skin. “I’m keeping it elevated, aristocratic — and taking the sex out of it, essentially,” explained De Mey. “No shine, but instead a matte fragility.” M.A.C’s Mixing Medium Matte was pressed onto the skin with the index finger, patted lightly around the cheek and nose and swept softly over the forehead and chin. De Mey also used M.A.C Select Cover-Up concealer under the eyes, softly blending it with a tapered brush. “The girls feel like themselves as I’m retaining the natural rosy color in their cheeks,” he explained, “which adds to the look of aristocratic purity.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/jw-anderson-behind-the-minimalist-hair-and-makeup-london-fashion-week-spring-2015/

The president has said we will put “no boots on the ground” in Syria; he is wary of simply flooding allies on the ground with arms, for fear that they will fall into the wrong hands — as they already have. Obama wants to strike against ISIS in a part of Syria that is currently outside the authority of the Syrian government, which the president has accused of war crimes, and is thus, in our eyes, a legal no-man’s land. He has also made clear that he is ready to go it alone in directing attacks on ISIS — he has asked for Congress’s support, but is not seeking their authorization. All these signs point to drones playing a prominent role in this new war in Syria.",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/drones-and-the-democracy-disconnect/

She then used Burberry’s New Eyebrows (out in October) to sculpt arches. “Not only is the color amazing, you can create a shadow rather than a solid block of color,” she said. “It’s completely foolproof and doesn’t look drawn on; it’s not heavy, it’s more sophisticated.” The models’ skin, meanwhile, positively glowed under an insect- and flower-printed, greenhouse-like tent. Rowe first treated the face with Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base in Golden Radiance before highlighting the cheeks. “The Golden Radiance works on any skin tone and you can’t see it,” she explained. “It just gives you a lift of a tan, which we want for summer.” For lips, Burberry’s Lip Definer in Brick Red was treated with a dusting of Fresh Glow Powder for a matte finish. “Yes, the red lip can, of course, look classic,” Rowe added. “But we want to keep it modern — that’s why we kept the eyes nude and the skin slightly darker.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/london-fashion-week-burberry-prorsum-spring-summer-2015-beauty/

That the vacant seats are not the only witnesses to the couple’s suicide at the end of the play — the chairs in the actual audience being occupied by viewers — heightens the sense of lost promise. In those chairs lies the slightness of the distinction between useful objects and relics. “We are after the end of the world, in our culture and in our perception of stuff,” says the Greek-Norwegian curator and architect Andreas Angelidakis, who conceived of the inaugural design exhibition at the Swiss Institute as a sequel of sorts to Ionesco’s play: just chairs, no people. He credits his therapist with the reference. “These are not the key pieces of modernist design, but an eccentric selection,” Angelidakis says of the survey, “Fin de Siècle,” opening tonight. “I didn’t curate it as museum overview, but as a casting director. Each chair was picked based on character, like casting actors.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/t-magazine/swiss-institute-chairs-exhibition.html

2014-09-16,A Night at the Museum,"More and more artful, and art-filled, hotels are popping up across the globe, blurring the lines between culture and accommodation.","Hotels dotted with paintings and prints are hardly rare, but taking a cue from “Al’s Grand Hotel” — Allen Ruppersberg’s bookable, seven-room installation, which popped up on Sunset Boulevard for six weeks in 1971 and was restaged at this year’s Frieze New York — more and more properties are blurring the lines between artwork and accommodation. The 21c Museum Hotel in Louisville, Ky., recently commissioned Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe to create “Asleep in the Cyclone,” an immersive “architectural collage” that doubles as a 500-square-foot guest room. Everything inside (from the geodesic-domed ceiling to the fake books and magazines) has been created or curated by the American art duo to evoke a ’60s-era hippie commune. Across the pond, one of the suites at the Beaumont in London — set to launch this fall in the Mayfair district as the first hotel from the restaurateurs behind the Wolseley and Brasserie Zédel — has been designed by Antony Gormley as a three-level “inhabitable sculpture.” Featuring fumed-oak interiors, the conjoined cubes of stainless steel mimic the British artist’s own body, a recurring theme in his work. Next spring, Living Architecture plans to unveil “A House for Essex” in the U.K., designed by the Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry in collaboration with the architecture firm FAT. With its ceramic-tile facade and aluminum roof sculptures, not to mention the handmade tapestries and artworks inspired by a fictional local character, it looks like something out of a fairy tale.

His former psychedelic-rock trio, Yura Yura Teikoku, sold out large venues whenever they played; they even toured the United States with the indie stalwarts Yo La Tengo. But since disbanding the group in 2010, he has favored a more low-key approach, eschewing live shows and retreating to the studio to produce his first solo album, “How to Live with a Phantom,” in 2011. That release, a mellow affair with jazzy guitar, Latin percussion and soft sax, called to mind the chilled-out feel of ’70s yacht rock and the sonic perfectionism of Steely Dan. When the label arm of the influential New York record emporium Other Music issued it in the United States, it became a cult classic. (The former Girls frontman and Hedi Slimane muse Christopher Owens, for one, has professed his love in multiple interviews.)",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/japan-indie-rock-star-shintaro-sakamoto-profile-new-album-stream/

2014-09-16,"Strange, Gorgeous Art Made From Single-Cell Organisms Under a Microscope","The practice was popular in the Victorian era, but there is only one artist seriously pursuing it today. Matthew Killip’s short film “The Diatomist,” which premieres exclusively with T, explores his unusual world.","Perhaps you’ve never done much thinking about the beauty of algae, but the Victorians did. Microscopists of the era used to arrange diatoms — single-cell organisms encased in jewel-like glass shells that likely date to the Jurassic Period — into stunningly beautiful mosaics that resemble stained glass in miniature. The last surviving diatomist is an Englishman named Klaus Kemp, who became fascinated with the practice as a teenager. Because the Victorians left no records behind, Kemp had to figure it out for himself. He’s still at it today, supporting himself by selling his creations to a small but avid group of collectors. The filmmaker Matthew Killip spent an afternoon with Kemp at his home in England in December of 2013, documenting his unique practice at the intersection of science and art.

U.S. Steel said that the Canadian company, known as Stelco before its purchase in 2007, has posted an operating loss of $2.4 billion over the last five years. With the filing, the Canadian unit’s results will no longer be included in U.S. Steel’s financial statements. In 2009, U.S. Steel shut down the Canadian operation and locked out its workers while demanding pension changes. That prompted a lawsuit from the government of Canada, charging that the company had failed to live up to foreign investment laws. An agreement to make further investments in Canada ended that action, although the company continues to battle unions. A lawyer for U.S. Steel Canada told the Ontario Superior Court that it had liabilities of between 3.86 billion and 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.52 billion and $3.9 billion), and assets worth between 1.9 billion and 2.3 billion Canadian dollars, according to The Globe and Mail.

2014-09-17,What’s On TV Wednesday,Television highlights.,"6:30 P.M. (Showtime) FRUITVALE STATION (2013) On Jan. 1, 2009, Oscar Grant III, a 22-year-old African-American father, was shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer on a subway platform in Oakland, Calif., his killing captured on cellphone. Ryan Coogler’s feature directorial debut reconstructs the final 24 hours in the life of Mr. Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan, above, with Ariana Neal) who, after two stints in a state prison, had returned to selling drugs after losing his job at a supermarket because of chronic lateness. Octavia Spencer plays his mother, still able to boss him around, and Melonie Diaz the mother of his daughter, with whom he’s trying to stay. Mr. Coogler’s “main intention — and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan’s — is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The radicalism of ‘Fruitvale Station’ lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that ‘Fruitvale Station’ at once exposes and resists.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Versions of it exist across the Caribbean and into Latin America.

But many Cubans claim the dish as their own, a taste of the pre-revolutionary island at its homey best. “Picadillo has a sentimental resonance,” said Betty Cortina, a Cuban-American food writer who is the editor of The Miami Herald’s lifestyle magazine, Indulge. She even took a recipe for picadillo with her to college at the University of Florida. “Everyone who is of Cuban descent has a recipe for it, and each one of those is the most authentic.

He shut its doors in 1994, moved to Seattle and, three years later, founded Big Leaf Manufacturing, a workshop that produces Domestic Furniture designs.

It was written and directed by Scott Frank, a script writer whose credits include “Get Shorty” and “Minority Report,” which means that he’s spent time transposing the likes of Elmore Leonard and Philip K. Dick to the screen. Mr. Frank is working with uglier, less pleasurable material here: a 1992 novel by Lawrence Block featuring his continuing character Matthew Scudder. It’s a story of good and evil in which men are as tough as nails and women little more than meat. The nail image is a metaphor; the meat less so.

The old man’s dying wish was that the Altman family — his widow and their four children — observe the Jewish custom of sitting shiva, even though he was never especially religious.

For Judd, embodied by Jason Bateman with his usual air of beleaguered responsibility, a family reunion following a marital calamity is a nightmare.

The announcement came amid new indications that the disaster had been the result of negligence and not sabotage, and that it was possibly caused by a mixing of vaccines and an anesthetic used to relax muscles during surgery. The opposition coalition, which considers itself the interim government in that part of the country, said on its website that the commission would submit a final report on Sept. 25.

The diseases are making a comeback in Syria because of the war and the collapse of public health services.

2014-09-19,1939: Slovaks Are Terrorized,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Nazis arrest workers in Slovakia in 1939.,"COPENHAGEN — Reports reaching here indicate that new acts of terrorism are being perpetrated in Bohemia and Slovakia. Following a revolt at the Skoda works, the Gestapo made hundreds of arrests. In many cases, families of arrested workers received a few days later the papers of the member of their family arrested and a primed notice warning them that they were not to wear mourning or to speak of the death. It is believed probable that the Gestapo carried out executions at Prague, in the basement of the Petchek Bank. Other executions have been reported from Brno, where a revolt has been suppressed. Rudolf Beran, former Premier, has been arrested. A number of executions have taken place at Zilina, in Slovakia, without the Slovak authorities being advised. To their inquiry the Gestapo replied that it was ‘‘obliged to take all measures of prudence necessary to prevent acts directed against the German Army.’’— New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 20, 1939",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/1939-slovaks-are-terrorized/

If they want arms, ‘‘we are ready to discuss the question in a brotherly fashion and give our help,’’ he said. Mr. Khrushchev told the youth forum delegates: ‘‘I did not look at hydrogen or atomic bombs, but I saw an assortment of weapons used for infantry, artillery, tanks and rockets. I saw them and I said: ‘See what man has built for man. It’s terrible.’’’ In his 45-minute extemporaneous speech, Mr. Khrushchev gave his third clarification of his remarks last week about Soviet weaponry.

There are dozens of them, as befits a writer of McEwan’s stature, and their titles should give even unversed readers a fair sense of his interests (as well as the interests of literary scholars today): “Pervasive Perspectives: Gender Relationships in the Fiction of Ian McEwan”; “The Child in Time: Postmodern Representations of Childhood in the Novels of Ian McEwan”; “A Mind With a View: Cognitive Science, Neuroscience and Contemporary Literature”; “The Epistemology of Evil in Ian McEwan’s Novels.” Sex, childhood, postmodernism, science, the nature of evil: Yep, that’s ­McEwan. (The paper about evil was written by a Serbian philosopher, Zorica Djergovic-Joksimovic, who later expanded her research into a book with the wonderful title “Ijan Makjuan: Polifonija Zla,” or “Ian McEwan: The Polyphony of Evil.”) McEwan recently told The Wall Street Journal that fans sometimes stop him in the street. “But literary fame is quite delightful compared to Hollywood fame or rock ’n’ roll fame or footballer fame,” he said, “because the kind of people who like literary fiction tend to come up blushing or squirming with embarrassment, trying to make themselves disappear but just wanting to tell you before they fade away that your work has meant a great deal to them.

2014-09-19,Rock Star in All His Permutations,An ambitious exhibition at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art documents David Bowie as a musical and performance pioneer.,"People who have doubts about the David Bowie exhibition opening at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago on Tuesday may find some misgivings soothed by the show’s ambitious catalog. It documents Mr. Bowie as a musical and performance pioneer whose means of visual expression included drawings, paintings and many shape-shifting, gender-bending ensembles — sometimes his own designs — for stage, cover art, videos and photos. Only about a third of the garments made the trip from the show’s point of origin, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. But they will include 11 for Ziggy Stardust, Mr. Bowie’s best-known character, and the Union Jack coat he collaborated on with Alexander McQueen. There will also be ephemera dating to Mr. Bowie’s childhood (he was born David Robert Jones in 1947) and examples of handwritten lyrics and projections of his most influential music videos. The material should convey Mr. Bowie’s wide-ranging achievement and also — as the museum’s news release says — repatriate him “into the territory of cutting-edge visual and performing art that is his natural home.” (mcachicago.org.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/arts/design/david-bowie-exhibition-opens-at-the-museum-of-contemporary-art.html

Kristen Wiig plays the crinkly-nosed co-worker on whom Walter has a crush; Adam Scott is the leader of the new tech-jerk bosses who have Walter’s job on the line. And Sean Penn is the mysterious photographer behind Walter’s travels to Iceland, Afghanistan and other stunning far-off places. “Though it is a celebration of modesty, there is also quite a lot of vanity in ‘The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,’ ” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. There is also a contradiction: “An ordinary fellow should not have to be quite so special to win our admiration. And this version of Walter Mitty undermines some of the democratic whimsy that has made his story such an appealing and durable modern myth. He used to be one of us: a self-deluded dreamer charmed by his unruly creative powers, a willing prisoner of his appetite for escapism. But now our identification gives way to envy, and he is another one of those enchanted people the rest of us can only dream of becoming.” The movie is followed at 9 by “On the Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay Z,” a concert special filmed on Sept. 12 and 13 at the Stade de France, near Paris, featuring performances of more than 40 songs during the couple’s only stop outside North America on the tour.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2014-09-21,What’s On TV Sunday,What’s On TV Sunday,"8:30 P.M. (CBS) MADAM SECRETARY Téa Leoni stars as Elizabeth McCord, a college professor and former C.I.A. analyst turned newly appointed secretary of state, who battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she navigates issues in the White House and abroad. Then there are matters with her husband and two children at home. Tim Daly plays her supportive spouse; Bebe Neuwirth is her chief of staff; Geoffrey Arend is her speechwriter; Keith Carradine is the president, and her former mentor; and Zeljko Ivanek (above left, with Mr. Carradine and Ms. Leoni) is his Dick Cheney-esque chief of staff. “Hillary Rodham Clinton is the obvious inspiration, but this is Hillary with a human face: Téa Leoni, who has a husky voice and a loose, engaging manner, is an unusually likable beauty,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “As Elizabeth McCord, she has all the brains and determination of the original and none of the political ambition and baggage.” Ms. Stanley added that a closer model for Mrs. Clinton can be found in the character of Alicia Florrick, the wife of a politician brought down by a sex scandal in “The Good Wife.” That show’s sixth season begins at 9:30, with Alicia refusing to run for state’s attorney. “She stands by his side for a while, then leaves him and restarts her legal career from scratch,” Ms. Stanley said. Of the two series, “ ‘The Good Wife’ stands out because it strikes the right balance of network-mandated virtue and cable-inspired vice. ‘Madam Secretary’ has some good moments, but it would be better if its heroine were just a little bit worse.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/arts/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

2014-09-21,"1939: Reich Maps Show France Partitioned, Says Daladier",From the International Herald Tribune archives: France accused Germany of partition plans in 1939.,"In a radio speech, Premier Edouard Daladier stated maps showing the dismemberment of France had already been printed in Germany, thus proving that Hitler’s assertion that he wanted nothing from France was as false as his past statements regarding Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and Poland. He refuted Hitler’s attempt to disclaim war responsibility, said it was futile for Germany to try to dissociate France and England, and declared French soldiers would fight to the end to crush the system of threats and alarms.

2014-09-21,1964: Otto Grotewohl Dies at 70,From the International Herald Tribune archives: The East German prime minister died in 1964.,"BERLIN — East German Premier Otto Grotewohl died of a stroke today after a long illness that had kept him politically inactive for several years. He was 70. It was expected he would be succeeded by Willi Stoph, who has been acting premier. Mr. Grotewohl, a former Social Democrat, was regarded as a traitor by West European socialists because of his leading role in merging the Social Democratic party with the Communist party in 1946 to form the Communist-run Socialist Union party. A spokesman for the West German Socialist party said Mr. Grotewohl will always bear the stigma of sacrificing the Social Democratic party in the Soviet zone of Germany. ‘‘He was also responsible for the death and imprisonment of thousands of fellow Social Democrats,’’ the spokesman said. ‘‘Politically, he has been a dead man for the past few years,’’ he said, ‘‘but he still served as bait for the regime.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 22, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/1964-otto-grotewohl-dies-at-70/

In January, the Agnes Varis Trust announced a $3 million gift that allowed Gibney Dance to take over and renovate a 36,000-square-foot space at 280 Broadway, next to City Hall, that Dance New Amsterdam relinquished when it declared bankruptcy a year ago.

With the beets and their greens you get two sets of nutrients: anthocyanins and betalains, known for their antioxidant properties, from the beetroots, and vitamins K and A, as well as other phytonutrients – lutein and zeaxanthin – from the greens. Both are excellent sources of folate, and beets are a very good source of manganese, potassium and copper.",Health,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/beets-recipe-ideas/

Venezuela suffers from inflation of more than 60 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods, a situation that could be exacerbated by Clorox’s exit.

And in the case of the British photographer and T contributor David Sims and the hairstylist Guido Palau, early collaborations proved to be the spark that ignited their careers. Both hail from similar backgrounds, having grown up around “not sophisticated London,” as Palau describes it, listening to a lot of David Bowie, punk and New Wave music. They formed an easy friendship in the mid ’80s and soon teamed up behind the lens, building a portfolio of test pictures that would define their respective styles: Sims would often cast lanky kids off the street, letting them do whatever they felt like in front of the camera, while Palau created “non-hair” that was usually messy, unwashed and always offhandedly cool. The look was a precursor to grunge and quickly caught the attention of Calvin Klein, who hired the duo to shoot his CK campaign featuring Kate Moss in 1993. It was a pivotal moment for Sims and Palau, yet neither realized it at the time. “I didn’t think even for a minute we’d end up making anything like a living from it,” says Sims. “Or be successful,” adds Palau.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/guido-palau-david-sims-interview-fashion-photography/

There was, however, “one subtle beauty element,” he said. “It’s a subtle golden line drawn down the center of the lip that resembles a lip piercing when it catches the light.” Safer and far less painful than the real thing, Philips’ faux-metal adornment simply requires a slick of Make Up For Ever’s Aqua Liner in Diamond Gold, applied via a fine MAC eyeliner brush. Looking back to the Rodarte runway, where eyebrows were studded with clip-on hoops, it seems piercings are making their mark for spring 2015.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/paris-fashion-week-spring-2015-dries-van-noten-beauty-painted-on-lip-rings/

She grew up to be a suffragist and a president of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., wrote plays and poetry, and built a theater that seated 150 on her property in Bellport, N.Y.

If Mrs. Edey had followed the path suggested by her dream home, she might have become an interior designer whose style was elegant, playful and scaled for drama.

Even when Scott’s men faltered, they continued collecting specimens, including rocks. The expedition ended terribly; everybody who made the push to the pole died.

2014-09-25,Revisiting the Original Classics of Surf Cinema,The reissue arm of the boutique Brooklyn record label Mexican Summer is releasing the soundtracks to the cult ’70s films “Crystal Voyage” and “Morning of the Earth.”,"Surfing is back in a big way, and with it, a renewed interest in artifacts from the original heyday of surf culture. Early films like Albert Falzon’s “Morning of the Earth” (1971) and “Crystal Voyager” (1974) marked a moment when wholesome ’60s representations of surfing (the Beach Boys, Frankie Avalon) gave way to depictions that were entwined with the counterculture. Both films featured exhilarating camerawork (by the surfer George Greenough, also responsible for inventing the modern surfboard fin), heady but mellow psych-rock soundtracks and an underlying message about the sanctity of nature. This month, the boutique imprint Anthology Recordings, part of the influential Mexican Summer label, reissues these two rare film soundtracks on heavyweight wax. And tonight, the label is screening a rare archival print of “Morning of the Earth” at Anthology Film Archives in New York (no relation to the record label). A song from the soundtrack, “Open Up Your Heart” by G. Wayne Thomas, plays here with footage from the film.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/surf-cinema-classics-albert-falzon-screening-anthology-film-archives/

Hardly any economists predicted the 2008 crisis — and the handful who did tended to be people who also predicted crises that didn’t happen.

In the film, Shaw, now in his 20s, recounts the rainy morning in September 2006 that he crossed the line of a Utah highway, knocking into a car containing two scientists, James Furfaro and Keith O’Dell, who were heading to work nearby. Both men were killed. Shaw says he was ­texting a girlfriend at the time, adding in unmistakable anguish that he can’t even ­remember what he was texting about.

The vacationing American tourist, Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen), is walking around the Acropolis with his wife, Colette (Kirsten Dunst), when he notices the other man observing him. It’s a glorious day, and the Americans are, true to the early 1960s time frame and their station, formally attired. She’s wearing a dress and hat, and carrying gloves and a purse. He’s wearing a tie, a three-piece suit, a straw hat and a pair of very dark glasses. ",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/movies/the-two-faces-of-january-from-a-highsmith-novel.html

Sandwiched between the music of Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne on the car radio was a promising new voice whose sound fit right in with theirs.

Allan Tresser) performed in the Catskills, he would display a pasteboard panel boasting of his television credits: As seen on “The Jack Paar Show”! And “Wonderama”! And ... well, I forget the rest, but not the idea: The king’s prime was decades past. And the billing presumed a similar vintage for his listeners as they prepared to obey whatever Simon Says — or doesn’t. But if Mr. Tresser had long since peaked, hadn’t the Fallsview Hotel of Ellenville, N.Y., in which he was resident tummler, also seen far better years? And the Nevele? And Kutsher’s? The last was celebrated in an elegiac 2012 documentary, “Welcome to Kutsher’s: The Last Catskills Resort,” which is being updated in December with a final section chronicling the hotel’s demolition to make way for a yoga retreat. In the 1980s, when films like “Dirty Dancing” or “Sweet Lorraine” were set in such hotels, they were already relics from another era.

Rather, it looks at the year he went from discovery to detonation. It happened fast: In 1966, Hendrix — played with dreamy reserve here by André Benjamin, a.k.a. André 3000 of Outkast — was a cool cat who was calling himself Jimmy James and playing with Curtis Knight and the Squires, an R&B band.

2014-09-26,The Brains and Braun of Dieter Rams,A look at the facts and figures behind this designer’s work.,"Chances are if you’ve shaved with an electric razor, blow-dried your hair or sparked up a cigarette in the past 60 years, you owe a debt of gratitude to Dieter Rams. During his four-plus decades working for Braun, many of which he also spent creating furniture for the British company Vitsoe, the German designer, 82, made a staggering number of stripped-down home goods and gadgets, many of which are as relevant now as the day they were conceived. Case in point: The same modular 606 Universal Shelving System bought in 1960 can still be seamlessly added to today and is as coveted by design aficionados as ever. But it is his ability to both inspire and confound successors like Jasper Morrison and Apple’s Jonathan Ive — spurred on by his prophetic principles of good design — that may be his greatest legacy. Describing Rams’s humble CSV 12 amplifier rotary switch in the foreword to the book “Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible,” Ive writes, “It could not be better, simpler, clearer or more beautiful.” In other words, less, but so much more.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/t-magazine/dieter-rams-braun-by-the-numbers.html

(13) ‘SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET’ IN CONCERT WITH THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC “Live From Lincoln Center” kicks off its 40th-anniversary season with Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler’s musical thriller, starring the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel as the bloodthirsty barber and the British actress Emma Thompson as the adoring pie maker Mrs. Lovett. “There are trade-offs in seeing ‘Sweeney Todd’ in concert, of course,” Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times about this production, conducted by Alan Gilbert. “The plot’s intricate comings and goings are not easy to delineate clearly, and the horrific action is impossible without a full stage of scenery.” But “the upside to seeing (or rather, hearing) ‘Sweeney’ played by a world-class orchestra made up for such awkwardness,” he added. “Mr. Sondheim’s score seems to grow more majestic each time you hear it (and more boisterous with raucous good-bad spirits), and the forward thrust of the drama as it reels into nightmare territory remains a model of musical theater writing.” Johnny Depp takes on the title role and Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett in Tim Burton’s film version, at 1:45 p.m. on IFC.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

It’s also sometimes called vicarious trauma, or empathic strain. In her book, “Trauma Stewardship,” Laura van Dernoot ­Lipsky, a former social worker, defines it as being unable to live with the knowledge that, despite our best efforts, most of the world’s suffering goes “unnoticed and unattended.” “Still,” she writes, “people who are working to help those who suffer . . . must somehow reconcile their own joy — the authentic wonder and delight in life — with the irrefutable fact of suffering in the world.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/books/review/the-scatter-here-is-too-great-by-bilal-tanweer.html

In her panic, she recites the Buddhist sutras “preaching unattachment, impermanence, the inevitability of death,” an unholy trinity that could apply to all civil wars. This chilling exchange reminded me of a conversation I once had on a London bus with a Somali refugee, who swerved from banal chitchat into dark reminiscence. He recalled a moment in Mogadishu when he was forced to recite his genealogy, the string of grandfathers’ names that place all Somalis within their clans, and he borrowed a school friend’s lineage, as his own would have marked him for death.

Ward and Ken Burns, No. 6 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list. But every now and then a book arrives that reminds you naming can be an art in itself; the best subtitles work almost like line breaks in poetry, forcing you to re-evaluate what came before. So let’s pause a moment to appreciate Caitlin Doughty’s “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” new at No. 14, which has the sit-up-and-take-notice subtitle “And Other Lessons From the Crematory.” Doughty is a young undertaker from Los Angeles who has made it her mission to demystify death, encouraging customers and the public at large to embrace a D.I.Y. approach to funerals. “They are grossed out,” she told The Atlantic in a recent online interview, “but that’s because they’ve been told their whole lives that death and bodies are best kept to the ‘professionals’ and that they are dangerous. Most corpses are safer than living bodies. Corpses don’t decompose immediately. They’re not a time bomb of deadness waiting to attack. They’re your mom or your husband, or the shell of them, at least. . . . Your average corpse is completely safe.” I’m not sure how soothing I find this pep talk — it’s not putrefaction I fear, it’s death — but I do admire Doughty’s cheerful sang-froid. I bet she’s excellent at her job.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The attack was made at daybreak. The Wachtmeister made a gallant attempt to hold the blockhouse commanding the Drift after his men had evacuated it, but he eventually surrendered. The patrol was then despatched up river. The Germans were discovered in a position from which they were dislodged after a smart skirmish and they retired. The South African force lost one killed, one wounded and two horses killed. The patrol then fell back. Regimental Sergeant-Major Thomas, of the 5th Regiment, behaved with the greatest gallantry, picking up a wounded rifleman and removing him out of danger while under heavy fire. Subsequent scouting disclosed the fact that an important grazing and watering station some miles within the border was held by the enemy. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 27, 1914 ",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/1914-british-take-orange-river/

Communism now ceases to exist as an organized force in any major country of Europe with the exception of course, of Soviet Russia. The action of the French government in proscribing the Communist party comes as no surprise. It had been foreseen for weeks, ever since Soviet Russia signed the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and followed it up by making an agreement with that country for the partition of Poland. Even Leftist papers like ‘‘L’OEuvre’’ have been advocating the Abolition of the French Communist party since the outbreak of the war. Leon Blum, the Socialist party leader, in ‘‘Le Populate’’ made an urgent appeal to the French Communists to save their party, by formally renouncing their allegiance to Moscow. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 27, 1939 ",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/1939-french-ban-communism/

Take the Scandinavian architects Claesson Koivisto Rune, who create warm, pared-back spaces that are low on embellishments but high on style, as evidenced by a Stockholm apartment distinguished by a single, spectacular brass cube. Or the couturier Stephan Janson, who years ago left the limelight in order to dress a more discriminating set of women. And after creating interiors for clients like Vera Wang and Anna Wintour, the decorator Stephen Sills passed up the opportunity to move into a palatial home, choosing instead to pour his heart and soul into a tiny, perfect apartment. Elsewhere in the issue, the Brussels-based designers Jorge Almada and Anna-Marie Midy forgo modern luxuries in favor of cowboy charm in their rustic Mexican casita; Jody Rosen gets twisted up in a convention as old as time — the humble knot — and meets one of its greatest champions; Malcolm Gladwell and Sarah Silverman politely decline cookies made of crickets, among other dubious temptations; and we examine the legacy of the legendary Braun designer Dieter Rams, whose career can be best summed up with the words “less but better.” See all stories from the issue >>",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/t-fall-2014-design-issue/

2014-09-28,1914: German Offensive Checked in Belgium,Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: German troops are surprised in Belgium in 1914.,"ANTWERP — The following communiqué has been issued here : ‘‘Yesterday [Sept. 26], a detachment of German troops, comprising a brigade of infantry, two regiments of cavalry and six batteries of artillery—two of which were heavy artillery—was surprised in its march from Brussels on Termonde, via Alost. Attacked in front and on their flank, the German troops retired in disorder toward Assche, leaving in our hands many prisoners and wounded as well as several caissons. To-day, apparently with the intention of avenging this defeat, Malines was bombarded by long-distance guns and important forces made a general movement along our front. Between Malines and Alost the several German attacks against us failed. Toward Alost, our division of cavalry succeeded in taking the German left wing in the rear. In short, the German attack has failed and our troops have without difficulty preserved the positions acquired from Antwerp to Malines. There, however, the station has suffered severely. Many houses have collapsed, others are on fire. A dozen civilians have been killed.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 29, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/1914-german-offensive-checked-in-belgium/

He believed the technology used to mass-produce cars may as well be applied to houses, driving prices down and increasing mobility.

2014-09-30,East Jerusalem Area Sees Influx of Jewish Settlers,"Jewish settlers moved early Tuesday into 26 apartments in seven buildings in a politically delicate, predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem.","Jewish settlers moved early Tuesday into 26 apartments in seven buildings in a politically delicate, predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. Activists opposed to the move described it as the largest influx of settlers into the area in decades. The neighborhood, Silwan — just south of the Old City in territory Israel captured in the 1967 war then annexed — is home to about 50,000 Palestinians. It is also the site of archaeological ruins believed to be the City of David, a Jewish historical landmark. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and most of the world considers it to be illegally occupied. A private investment company bought the properties over several years with the help of Elad, a settler organization dedicated to preventing any political division of Jerusalem. The Jewish population in the area is now expected to increase to 700 from 500, according to an Elad representative.
