2023-01-02,"In the ‘Cozy Catastrophe’ Novel, the End of the World Is Not So Bad","Originally published in 1939, “The Hopkins Manuscript,” by the British writer R.C. Sherriff, inaugurated a genre of post-apocalyptic fiction in which a resourceful hero survives unthinkable cataclysm.","In “Billion Year Spree,” his influential 1973 study of science fiction, the writer Brian Aldiss identified a kind of post-apocalyptic novel that he called “the cozy catastrophe.” These were stories about the end of the world in which a resourceful survivor — usually a British man from the middle class — puts together a relatively comfortable life for himself in the ruins. Although the genre is often associated with the work of John Wyndham, especially “The Day of the Triffids” (1951), Aldiss traced it back to THE HOPKINS MANUSCRIPT (Scribner, 385 pp., paperback, $18), by R.C. Sherriff, which first appeared in 1939. Reissued this month, this wonderful novel should powerfully resonate with readers whose consciences are troubled by inequality and climate change.

Originally based in Arcata, in Northern California, 10 years ago he moved his operation and established his own hives further south, in Point Reyes Station, Calif., near San Francisco. His varietal sparkling meads use honeys close to home and farther afield (Marin County Wildflower and Hawaiian Lehua Blossom, for example), each resulting in distinct aromas and flavors, just the way Champagnes are distinguished by terroir and cuvée. Now, to encourage small beekeepers worldwide, he and Michael Zilber, his managing director, have introduced the World Honey Initiative Collection, three new international sparkling meads in partnership with the World Honey Exchange, an organization that helps honey cooperatives. The Ethiopian Geteme Blossom sparkling mead is pale and floral, slightly bitter, with a honeyed aftertaste. Chilean Ulmo Blosson is a deeper gold, with hints of spice and mellow richness.

2023-01-05,"In the Mountains of Lebanon, a Centuries-Old Guesthouse Welcomes New Visitors","Plus: beauty tips from a makeup artist, a renovated Swiss restaurant and more recommendations from T Magazine.","The morning is very simple: I shower and wash my face with the Deep Cleanse exfoliating cleanser from Tatcha and, once a week, I’ll use this Sisley-Paris Exfoliating Enzyme Mask. That has been great for the discoloration on my skin. On my body I’ll use the Grown Alchemist Intensive Body Exfoliant followed by the Tatcha Hinoki Body Milk while my skin is still wet. Unlike a lot of creams that just sit on the skin, this really hydrates and sinks in. I wear the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair serum during the day, because I have eczema and it’s really protective, and EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46. I just got back from Japan and discovered this really great gender-neutral complexion line called Iroiku. It helps neutralize the undertones of the skin and gives you this really beautiful, balanced complexion, so I’ve been wearing that when I’m on camera. And I have a few things I always carry: Honest Beauty Magic Beauty Balm, I use it as a highlighter, elbow cream, everything. On my lips I use the Sisley-Paris Nutritive Lip Balm, which is heavier for winter. Lastly, no one seems to understand Tatcha’s Serum Stick — you can slather it all over your skin or on top of makeup if it’s starting to dry out, but I use it any time I’m feeling a bit dry or am getting flaky skin around my nose. A few times a week I’ll use 111Skin Celestial Black Diamond mask or Jaxon Lane’s Bro Mask, which has a lot of caffeine and niacinamide in it. I tried the Theraface Pro after giving one to a client who loved it, and I’ve noticed it really de-puffs and the LED lights help with breakouts. I also see Joanna Vargas for Triple Crown facials. The first time I saw her it changed my skin. I’ve been bald for so long and I’m very particular about my head-shaving ritual. I always use this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Shave Gel, but the trick is that you need to exfoliate the skin before and after. I’ve been using Tatcha’s Texture Tonic as an after-shave and I don’t get any bumps or razor burn — and it doesn’t sting. I even tell my clients to use it on legs or underarms where they might get bumps. The first fragrance I bought in college at the Nordstrom in Seattle was L’Eau d’Issey and it’s still the one I go back to.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/t-magazine/lebanon-travel-hotel-indira.html

France was divided over whether he was guilty or innocent, one side being largely monarchist and Catholic, the other liberal and Republican (in the French sense). The dramatic climax came when France’s great novelist Émile Zola — 125 years ago, on Jan. 13, 1898 — published an article headlined “J’Accuse,” in the form of an open letter to the president, claiming that not only was Alfred Dreyfus innocent but the reason he had been found guilty was that he was a Jew and there had been a high-level conspiracy to frame him. Zola was accused of libel, but rather than let him face probable imprisonment his friends put him on a train to England, where he sat glumly eating boiled potatoes while lamenting the hostility he had faced personally and the state of France’s democracy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/books/review/dreyfus-affair-the-prisoner-and-the-writer-heather-camlot-sophie-casson.html

They work at a very small company without a formal H.R. department so there is no recourse for the many work issues that arise.

For decades now, Savage has been arguing that our expectations for long-term partnerships are way too high; that healthy relationships are about acknowledging our vast spectrum of desires, not repressing them; and that monogamy is not the ideal setup for every partnership. Through over 30 years of writing “Savage Love,” one of the most widely read sex advice columns in the country, and more than 17 years of hosting the podcast “Savage Lovecast,” he has been one of America’s most subtly influential public intellectuals on the topic of how humans conduct our most intimate — and important — relationships.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-dan-savage.html

Act really weird.,"Like a lot of people who get into professional wrestling, Donovan Danhausen had a vision of a different version of himself. Ten years ago, at age 21, he was living in Detroit, working as a nursing assistant at a nearby hospital, watching a lot of “Adult Swim” and accumulating a collection of horror- and comedy-themed tattoos. He didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew that he liked to make short videos with his friends, the kind of outsider art that happens in basements and backyards across America. At the suggestion of one of those friends, he took a 12-week training course at the House of Truth wrestling school in Center Line, Mich., and then entered the indie circuit as a hand: an unknown, unpaid wrestler who shows up at events and does what’s asked of him, typically setting up the ring, pretending to be a lawyer or other species of extra, maybe participating in a battle royale. For the next few years, he worked shows around the Great Lakes region, wrestling strangers or sometimes the guy he rode up with, trying to figure out where he fit in.

The pain will not be shared equally.,"Early last October, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, spoke to several dozen graduate students at the University of Minnesota. Federal Reserve officials tend to choose their words with exquisite care. One misstatement or clumsy phrase, even before an audience dressed in shorts and flip-flops, can spook the financial markets. With the Fed, the nation’s central bank, rapidly raising interest rates to combat the highest inflation that the United States had experienced in four decades, Wall Street was especially skittish. But there was little chance of Kashkari’s committing a gaffe: He was a skilled public speaker, an ability that he honed during a failed campaign for governor in California in 2014. He also had a politician’s knack for using easy-to-understand anecdotes to illustrate complicated ideas. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/magazine/inflation-federal-reserve.html

It finally happened on Dec. 31. “I think it turned out for the best,” said the chief executive Shelley Armistead. She was taking a brief break from waiting tables in the restaurant’s upstairs dining room; she pitches in from time to time. The restaurant serves only breakfast and lunch, no reservations. Ms. Armistead cited the pandemic, construction and permits for the delays; dinner was not planned right out of the gate, and will not be served until more staff is trained. “But when you serve breakfast, you attract the neighborhood, not Instagram followers,” she said. The two-story, 120-seat space has a cafe area in front and a bright, rustic bare-table dining room with an open kitchen, bar and counter beyond. Upstairs, you’ll find two polished dining rooms and a bar with plush mohair banquettes and a sunny front area. In Los Angeles, the Gjelina Group has a bakery, a takeout shop and other retail venues, some of which Ms. Armistead is hoping to transport to New York. Ms. Armistead described the Gjelina Group as a “collective of 550 people,” taking the approach that they give as much financial support as possible directly to suppliers, like farmers, anglers, weavers, ceramists and flower cultivators. A collaborative menu helmed by Juan Hernandez consists of largely produce-driven specialties like lemon buckwheat ricotta pancakes, a frittata with leeks and herbs, and Moroccan baked eggs with merguez for breakfast; oysters, lamb tartare, smoked mackerel with arugula, roasted arrowhead cabbage in bagna cauda, einkorn pappardelle with brisket, duck confit with red cabbage, and 10 inventive pizzas, including one with mixed mushrooms and garlic confit.

2023-01-12,A Japanese Retreat That Brings New Meaning to Forest Bathing,"Plus: a modern French steakhouse, upcycled fashion and more recommendations from T Magazine.","Experimental and theatrical are among the words commonly used to describe the chef Paul Pairet’s culinary vision at Ultraviolet, his triple Michelin-star restaurant in Shanghai. But for his first project in France since the early 2000s, which opens Jan. 25 at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, the ambitions are more modest: perfectly executed, unpretentious French classics. Replacing the hotel’s former Brasserie d’Aumont and men’s grooming space, Nonos by Paul Pairet, with its moody interior by Tristan Auer, is the chef’s take on a modern French steakhouse (the name means little bone in children’s French). “I wanted to revive a retro-chic format of steakhouse dining from the ’60s and ’70s where the grill was front and center, servers came to the table with trolleys to slice meat and cheese, and dishes had broad appeal but were enhanced with the best products available,” explains the Perpignan-born Pairet. The menu is focused on familiar favorites ranging from onion soup and cheese soufflés to traditional dishes like seafood vol-au-vent. Comestibles, the deli area, will serve up snacks such as deviled eggs, pâté en croûte and Gascon cured ham. “Traditional French food is back in a big way across Paris,” Pairet says. “To do it right in an iconic setting like this — it’s a chef’s dream.” rosewoodhotels.com",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/t-magazine/hokkaido-japan-travel-hotel.html

It’s a reasonable request, yet it can feel uncomfortable, because it edges dangerously close to the question “Which poets today are actually any good?” The average book of American poetry probably sells 200 copies, and the average American poet is employed, if lucky, as an adjunct professor of creative writing at Pittsville State Technical College and Dog Park. To ask such a person “Whose work should I read?” is like asking people in quicksand whether they know anybody — other than themselves, of course — who deserves to be thrown this lovely rope you just happen to have in your hand.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/books/review/this-afterlife-a-e-stallings.html

Trump shocked the world in 2016 by winning the White House and becoming the first president in U.S. history with no prior military or government experience. He upended the fiction of electability pushed by pundits, the news media and many political consultants, which arrogantly projects who will or will not win long before votes are cast. He focused instead on capturing a majority in the Electoral College, which is how a candidate does or does not win.

2023-01-15,The Week in Business: More Air Travel Chaos,Consumer prices continue to cool down. Goldman Sachs began one of its largest rounds of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis. And Elon Musk is to go to trial over a 2018 tweet about Tesla.,"On the heels of Southwest Airlines’ holiday travel meltdown, a much wider systemic breakdown grounded planes last week. The source of the problem lay with the Federal Aviation Administration, whose system alerting pilots to safety issues went down on Wednesday. In total, the disruption caused more than 9,000 delays and 1,300 cancellations, leaving many passengers stranded with no airline to blame. The cause was a damaged database file, according to the agency, and the White House said there was no evidence of a cyberattack. But the system failure is nonetheless unsettling, revealing the fragility of the infrastructure that the country relies on to manage commercial air traffic. Critics say the F.A.A. has struggled to keep up with technological advances as well as the rise in the number of flights and passengers. The air travel chaos again put Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the agency, in the hot seat. He said he was trying to determine “how this could have happened in the first place.”",Business Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/15/business/the-week-in-business-airlines-faa-travel-disruptions.html

Four years ago, ‌following a career in finance and residential renovation, he obtained the rights to open a branch ‌in Hollywood, Calif., and‌ another in Santa Barbara. ‌Now, he’s opening one in New York. ‌With a big, glassed-in open kitchen in ‌a spacious rear dining room, the place is more restaurant than pizzeria. “A pizzeria doesn’t have to be a joint,” Mr. Zimone said. His is clearly not. It has a barroom in front, with a separate counter for salumi and cheeses, and a brick-walled main dining room beyond. Tables are roomy to accommodate the 16-inch‌ ‌Neapolitan-style pies with their typically flavorful thin crusts‌ and puffy, char-tattooed edge‌. Here, they’re also made with imported Italian ingredients like flour, San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella. (Mr. Zimone’s partner and head pizzaolo, Michele Rubini, is a fifth-generation member of the original pizzeria family.) In addition to pizza, there are antipasti, including gnocco fritto and montanarine made with fried pizza dough; salads; sandwiches (with a burger to come); a few pastas; and main courses. He said everything is made in house. In a few weeks, he plans to open a more-intimate Taverna downstairs for dining and private parties. After looking at many possible locations, he selected this one in the West Village, even though it required extensive renovation. “The streets reminded me of parts of Napoli and Trastevere,” he said. “It felt like home.”",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Union and Confederate soldiers put aside their differences on Sundays during the Civil War to pit their chickens against one another. Abraham Lincoln was given the nickname Honest Abe after he displayed impartiality as a cockfighting judge. Whatever the (dubious) historical merit of claims like these, they are meant to establish the deeply American identity of game fowl. “They fought them right out on the White House lawn,” says David Thurston, president of the United Gamefowl Breeders Association, a national nonprofit dedicated to the birds’ preservation.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/magazine/cockfighting-rooster-breeding.html

Your colleagues need to trust you for you to get anything done. ,"In the latest twist in the surreal saga of George Santos, this mystery man congressman has been named to seats on the House committees for small business and for science. As a former chairman of a House committee, I can envision the scene. Seating location is determined by seniority. As a new member, Mr. Santos will be seated on the distant end of the dais, which in a normal situation means zero attention from fellow members and minimal media coverage. But in Mr. Santos’s case, every time he speaks, every time he asks a question, the media spotlight will be on him — putting shame on him and unwanted glare on the committee and the Republicans who put him there. How do committee witnesses take his questions seriously? How do committee members sit still for this guy in their midst?",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/opinion/george-santos-house-committees.html

2023-01-18,"In Philadelphia, a Cocktail Bar With Bold Colors and Swedish Meatballs","Plus: buzzy hotels, psychedelic collages and more recommendations from T Magazine.","When the hospitality company Dovetail + Co. first envisioned a Hawaii outpost for Wayfinder, the boutique hotel brand whose original Rhode Island location is beloved for its Newport-specific charm, the group’s owner, Phil Hospod, knew he wanted to design a place that drew from “the B-side” of Waikiki, a reference to the lesser-known songs often found on a record’s flip side. The Wayfinder Waikiki is accordingly situated not on the oceanfront but on the (relatively) quiet Ala Wai Boulevard, with sweeping views of Diamond Head and the Koʻolau mountain range. (Still, it’s just a short three-block walk to the white sands and surf breaks.) The hotel’s rough-hewn ’60s Brutalist structure — a rarity among the neighborhood’s muted high-rises and tiki kitsch — now features eclectic, tropical interiors courtesy of the local design studio the Vanguard Theory. Drawing inspiration from the islands’ rich heritage, custom furnishings and textiles blend multicultural motifs for the 228 rooms. (Think: checkered palaka prints on pillows with aloha shirt designs and Japanese obi belt-inspired patterns decorating headboards.) A three-story Spanish terra-cotta building, housing rooms with kitchenettes, overlooks a 70-foot saltwater lagoon pool. Determined to give visitors a more insider experience of the island, Hospod and his team have partnered with a number of local businesses and organizations such as the record label Aloha Got Soul, which supplies the lobby with rare Hawaii vinyl reissues. The Bishop Museum, a century-old institution dedicated to Hawaii’s culture, is involved in creating a volunteer program for guests. In April, the hotel plans to open two on-site dining venues that will join its B-Side coffee bar: the first Waikiki location of Redfish (the popular Honolulu spot known for its inventive poke bowls) and the poolside bar Lost + Found, which will focus on local microbrews and tropical cocktails.

That’s where the audience was supposed to sit, in the tunnels, unable to see much of anything. “American Moon” was a Happening, and Happenings were expected to look like they involved more dumpster-diving than rehearsal.
