In the past, the sheet pan was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used in kitchens to make the cake known as chocolate roulade; it’s now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sanaë Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, “Hot Sheet,” you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point. As for a clafoutis, a pie plate works just fine.

2024-03-05,"If You Close It, Will They Come?","Two restaurants, Marc179 and the Chef’s Counter at Greywind, are open only three days a month.","You’ll be able to dine at this pair of new restaurants about as often as you receive your electric bill. Marc Murphy, who is opening Marc179, his first restaurant since 2019, will serve dinners three nights each month in the TriBeCa building that had housed Landmarc and which he uses for private events, TV and photo shoots. “Smaller works for me,” Mr. Murphy said. “I’ve missed interacting with the public and this allows me to be there.” He has redone the space with skylights and seating for 64, and will serve a four-course menu, $75. It will change monthly; the lineup for March is arugula salad, bucatini cacio e pepe, roast chicken breast with mushrooms, and chocolate mousse. A brief wine list of half and whole bottles is gently priced with a bottle of Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Chablis for $38, a bottle of Mas de Daumas Gassac cabernet sauvignon for $65, a half-bottle of Ridge Lytton Springs zinfandel for $42, and a half-bottle of Krug Grand Cuvée for $110. “I’ve gone from six restaurants and 650 employees to just four, and I can make money here,” Mr. Murphy said. When not serving dinners, the space houses his events company, MM Kitchen Studio. (Opens March 7, 8, 9) Then there’s Dan Kluger with Greywind, a complex near Hudson Yards that has a restaurant, a bar called Spygold and a bakery that becomes the Chef’s Counter three evenings a month. “I need to be there, but I don’t want to take on too much,” Mr. Kluger said. “The space is also used for private events so I can’t overcommit.” The counter has seats for eight people and offers about six courses with various themes, changing each month, with vegetables and proteins in tandem, $185 at 5:45 and 8:15 p.m. Last week’s menu included leek terrine with potato soup and trout roe, and chicken “oyster” with oyster mushrooms.

The movie’s got an earnest, amateurish case of the feel-good gosh-gollies that would have made sense playing down the hall from movies as different (although not that different) as “Go Fish” and “Wigstock,” “Zero Patience” and “The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love” and — God help us all — “Claire of the Moon.” The two dozen or so songs in “Glitter & Doom” aren’t new (but aren’t based on Tom Waits’s 15-year-old live album, either). They’re by the Indigo Girls. Many of them are songs the Indigo Girls made a certain kind of popular during the years of that very bonanza. And what the movie does with them is call attention to the emotional mountain range of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray’s songwriting.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/movies/glitter-and-doom-review-indigo-girls.html

The two girls are still close, but lead entirely different lives. The studious, ambitious Mikuan dreams of going to university outside the reservation and becoming a writer, while Shaniss struggles to raise her baby with her abusive husband. The director, Myriam Verreault, beautifully mixes joy and tragedy, offering a view of Indigenous life that feels both authentic and bereft of cliché. As both Mikuan’s naïve optimism and Shaniss’s cynicism are tempered over the course of the film, they arrive at a truth somewhere in the middle: that while the world is an unfair and unequal place, they can dream of a different one.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/movies/international-movies-streaming.html

Last week, City Hall and the Department of Transportation issued new guidelines for Dining Out NYC, its official program, and the largest such program in the country. “It’s been a priority for Mayor Adams from Day 1,” said Ya-Ting Liu, the city’s chief public realm officer. Restaurants and other establishments that serve food can now apply for permits to take part through an official portal online. Those that are approved and pay a fee for a four-year license ($1,050) for either a roadbed or sidewalk enclosure have 30 days to remove their temporary structures or outfit them to comply with the city’s rules. The authorized structures can remain in place from April through Nov. 29. Restaurants without approval will have to remove their sheds by Aug. 3; those with a pending application will have until Nov. 1. The city has approved four prototypes designed by WXY Studio to eliminate many of the problems with existing makeshift sheds and to adapt to various roadway and sidewalk configurations. They are being built by SITU, a fabrication company, and are already in place at several restaurants. They are not heated and will supposedly be rat-proof; some models are equipped with solar panels. At Bodrum, on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, Huseyin Ozer, an owner, said the 40-foot unit in the roadway outside his restaurant had planters, could be customized with signage, will allow for 16 seats and is easy to disassemble. Hinged floor panels lift to allow for cleaning.

In 1835, a 14-year-old Vuitton embarked — by foot — on a 280-mile, two-year pilgrimage to Paris, where he spent nearly two decades mastering the art of box making under the tutelage of a prominent malletier. Following his appointment as the official trunk maker for Napoleon III’s wife, Eugénie de Montijo, Vuitton opened his first luggage shop in 1854 near Place Vendôme, where he sold leather travel goods and canvas steamer trunks. Vuitton’s business was strong enough that in 1888, his only son, Georges, trademarked his now-signature checkerboard Damier print. The company’s steamer bag, which was intended to contain laundry on trans-Atlantic voyages, debuted in 1901; in the 1930s, the brand released the Keepall, a foldable tote, originally made from cotton canvas, that was small enough to be tucked into larger suitcases.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/t-magazine/pharrell-tyler-the-creator-louis-vuitton-bag.html

Air Canada Ruined Our Trip to Ireland but Won’t Take the Blame.,A Minnesota couple’s vacation fell apart after a jet bridge accident and a code-share snafu led to two nights of failed connections.,"Last September, my husband and I left our kids with their grandparents and set off to Ireland. Our $2,132 itinerary took us from Minneapolis to Toronto to Dublin on tickets booked on United Airlines through Expedia but ultimately operated by Air Canada, a United partner. We had boarded our connecting flight in Toronto (and I was already dozing in my seat) when the captain announced an operator had crashed the jet bridge into the starboard engine. We were given hotel vouchers and told we would be rebooked for the next day. Checkout time came and went without a word, so we went to the airport and were told to call Air Canada customer service. An agent booked us a flight for that evening, and we printed out boarding passes at an airport kiosk. But when we tried to board, we were told the boarding passes were invalid. Eventually, we were offered two options for the next day: Fly to Dublin via Newark, or return to Minneapolis. We cut our losses and went home after staying the night in Toronto at a hotel. But United refunded us only $1,087, barely half of what we paid. Air Canada did reimburse us for the second hotel and other expenses, but we believe the airlines owe us not only a full refund, but also 400 Canadian each ($295 apiece) under Canadian law for denied boarding.

This closet, which has become a sacred space for movie buffs, was once a disused bathroom at the headquarters of the Criterion Collection, a 40-year-old company dedicated to “gathering the greatest films from around the world” and making high-quality editions available to the public on DVD and Blu-ray and, more recently, through its streaming service, the Criterion Channel. Today Criterion uses the closet as its stockroom, housing films by some 600 directors from more than 50 countries — a catalog so synonymous with cinematic achievement that it has come to function as a kind of film Hall of Fame. Through a combination of luck, obsession and good taste, this 55-person company has become the arbiter of what makes a great movie, more so than any Hollywood studio or awards ceremony.",Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/podcasts/the-daily/the-sunday-read-sure-it-won-an-oscar-but-is-it-criterion.html

2024-03-18,"Two Artists Make a Home for Their Family, and Their Collection",Rashid Johnson and Sheree Hovsepian have transformed their New York townhouse into a showplace for creativity.,"WHEN THE ARTISTS Rashid Johnson and Sheree Hovsepian bought their home near Gramercy Park in 2020, it was a longstanding shrine to rock ’n’ roll glory. On a gracious Manhattan block shielded by a canopy of Bradford pear trees, the five-story, almost 24-foot-wide townhouse, built in 1910 and reimagined by the architect Rosario Candela in 1919, had been owned for three decades by Ric Ocasek, the late co-founder and lead singer of the Cars, and his wife, the model Paulina Porizkova. There was cheetah-print carpeting, tall potted palms and bathrooms with mirrored walls and black lacquer. Four years in, Johnson, 46, and Hovsepian, 49, who live with their 12-year-old son, Julius, and a dog named Bruno, have transformed the 5,800-square-foot space — with its vast 20-foot-tall living room and wall of casement windows that open onto a back garden — into a radically different sort of sanctuary. “Art is the center of our approach to everything,” says Johnson. “That’s where we put our energy.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/t-magazine/rashid-johnson-sheree-hovsepian-home.html

Moya was staying nearby, at the tumbledown hotel Torre di Bellosguardo, when he learned that another unlikely (and quite strange) residence had become available. It was in the area — the southwestern Florentine hills, quiet and almost suburban, where families have long purchased properties with views of the Duomo — so Moya decided to stop by. “Anyone who lives here looks at the market all the time,” he says over espresso one frosty December morning. “There’s nothing [available], really.

In the course of the next 50 years, he’d meet and marry the artist Marina Adams, who makes rhythmic large-scale paintings in vibrant jewel tones, and together, they’d raise their son, William — all in that loft. For decades, Whitney also used part of the 2,000-square-foot space as his studio, a room without natural light where he painted and drew his abstract works, including his signature gridlike compositions of startling, luminous colors: chlorine blue, taxicab yellow. By 2019, the couple were looking for more space, so their real estate agent took them to Long Island’s eastern end. Though the Hamptons’ open landscapes and light have long attracted artists, perhaps most famously the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner in the 1940s, Adams, 63, and Whitney, 77, had never felt an affinity for the area, whose spirit has become markedly less bohemian in recent decades. “We weren’t interested,” Whitney says. “But then she took us to Jack and Manuel’s place and I thought, ‘Oh, I could do this.’”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/t-magazine/marina-adams-stanley-whitney-bridgehampton-home.html

2024-03-21,Why ‘Uncle Vanya’ Is the Play for Our Anxious Era,"Despite debuting 125 years ago, Anton Chekhov’s drama of claustrophobia, resentment and despair feels perfectly suited to present day America.","IN WATCHING MIXED-BREED dogs play, I’ve often thought that mutts are more dog than the purest purebred. They’re the essence of caninity, all mud, turf and wet fur. So, too, with dramatic works: Some are purebred — think of William Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” (1611) or Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (1962) — while others are mad rambles, off leash and messy. This brings me to Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” (1897), a singularly psychologically destabilizing piece of theater that’s now being seen anew as a study of post-Covid paralysis, not to mention the existential dread of watching your life slip away by the spoonful. Although first produced in Moscow in 1899, it feels just like our present American age, when nobody hears anybody else because listening hurts too much; when the most comforting activity imaginable is a long, solitary walk followed by an even longer interlude of silence. This is a drama about being driven insane by the sound of other people’s desires, complaints and aspirations when you’re already being tortured by your own. The pandemic and the boorish political and public discourse that followed drove us inward, unable to fight back, going nuts like poor Vanya.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/t-magazine/chekhov-uncle-vanya-heidi-schreck.html

Ishkar, a London-based company that collaborates with NGOs and artisans to create job opportunities for those living in isolated areas of countries often affected by war, recently commissioned him to create a capsule collection with women weavers in Afghanistan. Barthélemy typically works with artisans in person to create tapestries or rugs but, since the Taliban retook power in 2021, he’s had to connect with the weavers remotely. At the start of their collaboration, Barthélemy asked the weavers to draw a place that symbolized beauty to them. Many of the women chose the 14th-century Bagh-e Babur (Babur’s Garden) in Kabul. Images from those drawings, and one by Barthélemy himself, were then combined to create the patterns for three different rugs. Each one took about six months for the women to hand knot from Ghazni Wool. They are, Barthélemy says, “a collective dream of an ancient paradise.” The rugs can be seen in London at Sunbury Workshops on Swanfield Street from April 24-26, and through September at the Ishkar flagship showroom; from about $4,000, ishkar.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/t-magazine/modernist-cement-zia-tile.html

2024-03-31,"Hollywood’s New Fantasy: A Magical, Colorblind Past",Films and TV shows keep reimagining history as a multiracial dream world. Is that really a step forward?,"Not long ago, in the cinema, I found myself trying to focus on Timothée Chalamet’s charming portrayal of a young Willy Wonka, arriving penniless in a new city. What drew my attention instead was the population he encountered there. The first person to greet him was a joyful British Indian. Soon we met a cute orphan sidekick, played by a Black American actor, and the chief of police, played by a biracial American. The vaguely Mitteleuropean city Wonka had come to — Viennese shops, Italian architecture, English language — was a happy melting pot: All races seemed to coexist without race meaning anything. The story was set in a fantastical past, but its cast looked like a utopian 21st-century London, with actors of British and Caribbean and Asian backgrounds all stirred together. The Oompa-​Loompas, described by Roald Dahl as a pygmy people found “in the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had ever been before,” were played by Hugh Grant.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/31/magazine/hollywood-movies-race-diversity.html

The guy is a gifted carnival barker, no doubt. But when it comes to serious business, he is a bad bet. Many of his ventures, from vodka and steaks to casinos and “university” degrees, have flopped like dying fish. Declaring corporate bankruptcy seems to be one of his favorite hobbies. And even when he wriggles away from failure largely unscathed, the other parties involved aren’t always so fortunate.
