Her eyes, emotional and direct, are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze-block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica. Smith, 31, made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures, a technique which evokes both the coming-of-age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat. “It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one,” Smith says of his images, as he walks toward the sole window in the work space, located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City, Missouri, where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute. Pinned to the white walls, and still in progress, are four of his signature “picotages” — his word for inkjet pigment prints layered with ornate architectural elements and mounted on museum board — which will go on display on April 4 as part of “Junction,” his first solo exhibition with the Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/t-magazine/paul-anthony-smith-art.html

This latest restaurant fills a brick-walled space. Up half a flight of stairs, there’s a Corian and stainless-steel kitchen and serving island. “It’s the stage in the middle,” Mr. Techakraisri said. Along one side of the island, the kitchen prepares sandwiches by day, and dinner entrees in the evening. All feature a choice of beef, turkey, salmon, pork or falafel. The food is high quality and well prepared, though the entrees could use better presentation than a cardboard tub.

2019-04-09,How to Laugh at Yourself,"Make a list of things you don’t like about yourself. Crack jokes about the less-painful stuff first. Be self-deprecating, not self-disparaging.","“Laughing at yourself is one of the hardest humor skills,” says Jennifer Hofmann, a researcher at the University of Zurich who studies laughter and emotional expression. How easily you can do so will depend in part on your disposition. If you tend to be dour, you can learn to be funnier with practice. (Or don’t — and risk developing what one humor scientist has termed “terminal seriousness.”) In one of Hofmann’s studies, subjects underwent two months of a well-known seven-step humor training program. Laughing at yourself was the penultimate step (what Hofmann calls “Olympic level” humor). Before trying it, first figure out what you think is funny and surround yourself with more of it. When it’s time to laugh at yourself, be prepared for an unpleasant task: You need to list the things you don’t like about yourself — maybe you’re insecure about your body or dislike your lisp. Arrange the list from least sensitive to most, then read it to someone before you start cracking jokes (researchers believe this vulnerability exercise greases the wheels for future levity). Next, come up with a few self-referential jokes about the less weighty stuff and eventually work your way up to the more painful things. “Strategically desensitize yourself,” Hofmann says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/magazine/how-to-laugh-at-yourself.html

There were some differences, of course. Size, for one thing: Westeros is a sprawling continent, whereas the entire island of Ireland could fit snugly inside the state of Indiana. And the northern part of Westeros looked as if Britain had been clumsily grafted onto it. There was also the fact that Westeros did not technically exist — that it emerged fully formed in the mid-1990s out of the volcanic imagination of the American fantasy writer George R.R. Martin — and that Ireland and Britain technically did, though their borders persisted in a state of ontological flux. My curiosity about this cartographic relationship led me to enter the terms “Ireland Westeros map” into Google, where I learned that my observation was not an original one. Martin himself had confirmed as much in an interview at Comic-Con in 2014. “Westeros began,” he said, “as upside-down Ireland.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/magazine/game-of-thrones-northern-ireland-brexit.html

2019-04-18,36 Hours in Mendocino County,"Tall trees, mushroom ice cream, a Buddhist brunch: the possibilities are endless in this rural slice of Northern California.","Ninety miles north of San Francisco, Mendocino County is just far enough away to have narrowly escaped the Bay Area’s radical transformation during the tech boom years. In contrast to other formerly quiet Northern California backwaters, Mendocino maintains its rural identity and eccentricities, including its longstanding status as one of the country’s major marijuana-producing regions. Where there is big news, it’s largely culinary. The 30-year-old chef at Elk’s Harbor House Inn was recently named a James Beard award semifinalist for Best Chef in the West. Besides the Harbor House’s eight- to 12-course, $150 per person prix fixe dinners, there are cheesemakers, upstart breweries, exceptional farm stands — notably Fort Bragg’s Nye Ranch and Caspar’s Fortunate Farm — and farm-inspired restaurants, like the long-awaited, soon-to-open Fog Eater Cafe, which began as a farm pop-up, and will serve “California cuisine with a Southern twang.” After years of population stagnation, young people are moving in, or coming home, and committing themselves to Mendocino’s fertile soil and sea. It’s a second wave back-to-the-land movement and a welcome reprieve from the Bay Area’s buzz.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/travel/what-to-do-in-mendocino-county.html

2019-04-18,‘Fast Color’ Review: Can a Gifted Family Save a Parched World?,Julia Hart’s wonderfully strange dystopian drama pits three gifted black women against a dried-up world and a hostile government.,"“Fast Color” is many things — a dreamlike dystopian drama; a warm celebration of family and female power; a teasing hint of superhero-origin story — none of which fully explains its gentle grip on our attention. What it is not, is speedy, with a narrative that moves carefully, even languidly, and visuals so beautifully patient that we have time to memorize their texture and import. Special effects are all the more so for being used sparingly, and the movie’s few characters feel no need to be constantly explaining themselves.

And they’re essentially gone.,"I have a confession to make: I miss Katherine Heigl. In the mid- to late 2000s she spent five years doing romantic comedies, or what was left of them by the time she got there. She put up a decent fight. To watch her withstand the jeers of the boy-men in “Knocked Up,” the cave-manning of Gerard Butler in “The Ugly Truth” or the bridesmaid-outfit montage in “27 Dresses” was to witness a genre’s assault on one of its last dedicated practitioners. Heigl didn’t get to show the luminance, flintiness or idiosyncrasy of her romantic-comedy forebears; she was given too few moments of wit or insight. Instead, she was tough, stubborn, gainfully employed and — like most of the women in these movies, by that point — counterproductively heartless, tolerant of whatever partnership the plot backed her into. Her time as a romantic-comedy star was more a feat of survival than a cause for celebration.

His black-and-white sketches illustrate a collection of stray thoughts — “snippets of adventure, random memories, maxims, ghosts, forgotten heroes, trees, the raging sea,” as he explains in his preface. But one recurring motif is the story of Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish philosopher and cultural critic who witnessed Europe being consumed by fascism. In Pajak’s drawings, Benjamin experiences the maddened crowds, exiles himself to Ibiza and then Paris, and eventually commits suicide during a failed escape from the Continent. In an email, Pajak explained his fascination with the philosopher: “The past has two faces: the past of the victors and the past of the vanquished, erased from history. But, history can only exist if the present repairs the trauma of the past. The injustice done to the victims of history must be repaired, even and especially if, as Benjamin wrote, ‘it is more difficult to honor the memory of the nameless than that of the known.’”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/books/review/frederic-pajak-uncertain-manifesto.html
