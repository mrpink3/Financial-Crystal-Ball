These are, by my own, probably highly debatable, count: Kenji Mizoguchi’s “Utamaro and His Five Women” (1946), Vincente Minnelli’s “Lust for Life” (1956), John Huston’s “Moulin Rouge” (1952), Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Andrei Rublev” (1969), Peter Greenaway’s “The Draughtsman’s Contract” (1982), Jacque Rivette’s “La Belle Noiseuse” (1990), Ed Harris’s “Pollock” (2000), Julie Taymor’s “Frida” (2002), Mike Leigh’s “Mr. Turner” (2014), Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s “Never Look Away” (2018) — and two movies by Julian Schnabel, who is the only director on the list who can also claim to have made a pretty decent living as a painter. His first film, 1996’s “Basquiat,” is about his former contemporary Jean-Michel Basquiat, and is part biopic (the title character is played by the great Jeffrey Wright), part artistic treatise and almost as much about Schnabel, who actually painted the imitations of Basquiat works that appear in the film himself (he refers to them now as “props”) and shot various scenes inside his own New York City home. His second and superior film about a painter, 2018’s “At Eternity’s Gate,” is an existential portrait of Vincent van Gogh — played by Willem Dafoe — that illustrates the contrast between his pained final days and his outsize influence.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/t-magazine/julian-schnabel-van-gogh.html

I really don’t know how to deal with this situation productively as an ally. I usually don’t mention it to my friend both because I feel it’s my responsibility to deal with it and because we’ll probably never see the offending person again.

Noncitizens are not formally part of the body politic; democracies since Athens have included franchise restrictions as punishment for criminals; children can’t make well-informed rational choices. Many people may disagree with one or several of these choices. Maybe denying the franchise to felons is unjust, given bias in the criminal justice system, or perhaps permanent residents should be allowed to vote, as they often could in the 19th century.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/opinion/politics/kids-right-to-vote.html

E. B. Du Bois’ is quite simply the best book that I have read in a very, very long time.” It enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, almost 25 years to the day after Oprah announced her very first book club pick: Jacqueline Mitchard’s “The Deep End of the Ocean,” another debut novel that went on to be a best seller (for 16 months). In 1996, when Oprah announced the choice on her talk show, she said: “I want to get the whole country reading again. Those of you who haven’t been reading, I think books are important!” She explained how the club would work: Readers who wanted to have dinner with Mitchard could send a letter to a Chicago P.O. box or “write us at America Online, those of us who know how to do that.” The studio audience smiled politely and clapped.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/books/review/the-love-songs-of-web-dubois-honoree-fanonne-jeffers.html

2021-09-03,What’s Wrong With Sex Between Professors and Students? It’s Not What You Think.,We need to get beyond evaluating sex solely through the lens of consent. ,"Netflix’s new hit comedy “The Chair” revels in certain clichés of university life — mock-Gothic buildings, wood paneling, crusty old-timers who don’t know how to use a photocopier, and, of course, an ambiguous relationship between a professor and a student: Bill is a charismatic English professor who is in a tailspin after the death of his wife, and Dafna is a literature-loving undergrad who is desperate to get into Bill’s class. She gives him a ride; they quote T.S. Eliot to each other; he signs a copy of his book for her; she makes him a pie. We think we know where this is going, because we’ve seen it so many times before: in “Election” (1999), “The Squid and the Whale” (2005) and “Elegy” (2008), based on Philip Roth’s novel “The Dying Animal” — to take just a few recent examples. “The Chair” ultimately upends our expectations in a way that is both comic and poignant.

It’s a conviction that allows us to ennoble ourselves with pathos, with rueful maturity, with wisdom won too late. To be certain that we’re at the beginning of something can mean feeling optimistic and openhearted about the future in a way that, especially these days, risks courting contempt. And to know that we’re in the middle of an era is — well, it’s not even a phrase, is it? It’s nothing much at all, simply a kind of semipermanent Wednesday of the soul, a spirit-flattening acceptance of stasis and complacency. But nearing the end? In that, you have a lifetime’s worth of wistfulness, and perhaps some bitterness and grief, not to mention prescience about what might come next. In short, life at the end of an era is — to use a term that might be coming to the end of its own era — lit.

Pandanus is a genus of tropical evergreens that grow in Southeast and South Asia, Oceania and Africa, with leaves that tend to rise and arch in a whorl around the stem and bulbous fruit, whose polyp-like knobs evoke a pineapple’s armor — hence the English name, screw pine. For Leichhardt, initial results were poor: the “rich, mellow pear-like” flesh of the fruit, he wrote, proved to be “hot, and made our lips and tongues very sore.” (Stomach trouble ensued.)

For Dang, who is a pharmacist, there’s a ritual to eating this simple but potent dish, one she has upheld since she was young.

But Giancarlo Valle means it more specifically, as in a fairy tale. Valle, who creates soft, pared-down interiors and things to fill them, practices a strain of modernism dosed with whimsy — squat, oblong tables with mosaic tiled tops that resemble tortoise shells; stubby tearoom chairs upholstered in nubby chenille that recall the bottom half of a faun; velvet couches the color of tree bark that wind on for longer than would seem strictly necessary, all of which would look at home in a stylish storybook cottage, possibly one tucked within an enchanted forest. So it can be surprising to learn that Valle, 39, trained as an architect, a discipline that demands icy rigor, and worked for a number of years for some of the field’s most influential practitioners, including the firms SHoP and Snøhetta. In many ways, his own practice, which he started in 2016, is an effort to unlearn architecture’s cool remove, with which he grew disillusioned, in favor of something warmer.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/t-magazine/giancarlo-valle-design.html

2021-09-10,A Classic Valise Gets a Silvery Sheen,"Louis Vuitton’s petite Cotteville suitcase, which has roots in a 1930s-era design, has been updated for the traveler of today.","When Louis Vuitton, a malletier who got his start as a professional packer for the wife of Napoleon III, founded his namesake Paris-based firm in the mid-19th century, travel was cumbersome, time-consuming and rare. The heavily reinforced trunks he fashioned had to be big enough to hold months’ worth of belongings and to endure long sea voyages and arduous train trips. But in the years between the world wars, as automobile and commercial air travel proliferated, life on the road became easier and more streamlined, as did the luggage the house produced. During the 1930s, the company began making a trio of boxy poplar-wood-frame suitcases in graduated sizes — the Alzer, the Bisten and the Corté, the last of which has been known since the late 1960s as the Cotteville — covered in the brand’s monogrammed canvas. The smallest of Louis Vuitton’s hard-sided porte-habits (at only 16 inches wide), the Cotteville, which, like the larger cases, is adorned with the signature S lock, leather trim and brass fittings, has always been synonymous with on-the-fly luxury. This season, Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of the brand’s men’s wear line, has designed the Cotteville 40 in the house’s Mirror Monogram canvas with silvery metal trim and a contrasting pale leather handle. Reflective of a collective craving for travel, the compact suitcase seems perfect for its era: shiny and hopeful, with a nod to the past.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/t-magazine/louis-vuitton-travel-case.html

The fragrant No. 1 combines Hendricks gin with makrut lime leaves, coriander seeds and lime juice, though come fall, it will be varied with apple flavors. For the No. 4, which has cucumber, cumin, fennel and Plymouth Gin, the cucumber will soon be replaced with pear. The popular No. 2 will lose its muddled strawberries for persimmon, but the black peppercorns will still be in the generous balloon glass. Mr. Swet said he wanted to preserve the Indian tradition of gin and tonic, while adding spices and other ingredients used in Indian cooking, and also to make the drinks seasonal, not just for summer. He consulted with the restaurant’s chefs.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/dining/gin-and-tonic-sona-restaurant.html

2021-09-14,The New Science on How We Burn Calories,"How could that change our understanding about, for starters, chronic disease, aging and obesity?","It’s simple, we are often told: All you have to do to maintain a healthy weight is ensure that the number of calories you ingest stays the same as the number of calories you expend. If you take in more calories, or energy, than you use, you gain weight; if the output is greater than the input, you lose it. But while we’re often conscious of burning calories when we’re working out, 55 to 70 percent of what we eat and drink actually goes toward fueling all the invisible chemical reactions that take place in our body to keep us alive. “We think about metabolism as just being about exercise, but it’s so much more than that,” says Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. “It’s literally the running total of how busy your cells are throughout the day.” Figuring out your total energy expenditure tells you how many calories you need to stay alive. But it also tells you “how the body is functioning,” Pontzer says. “There is no more direct measure of that than energy expenditure.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/magazine/calories-weight-age.html

Porter’s novel “Pollyanna.” “The news is that only an unregenerate cynic with an abiding dislike of kids, good or bad, Technicolor and a gentle legend spun in standard, obvious style would rail at this picture-postcard remembrance of improbable things past,” our reviewer wrote. “The blond, pixieish Miss Mills gives a restrained, natural and gratifyingly mature performance. She is a likable youngster whose mannerisms and speech are unaffected and convincing.” Mills won a special Academy Award, presented by Shirley Temple, for this role. “Forever Young” appears at No. 9 in its first week on the hardcover nonfiction list.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/books/review/forever-young-hayley-mills.html

He relished this position, but over the next decade produced little else to justify it. He was nearing 40 before he completed another great work, “Death in Venice,” a novella about an aging writer whose fascination with a beautiful young Polish boy keeps him on vacation even as a cholera epidemic descends. Mann started almost immediately on a second novella that would reproduce “Death in Venice”’s theme — the strange allure of “decadence,” illness and death — in a comic mode. He was working on this companion piece in 1914, when the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand set into motion the events that would begin World War I.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/books/review/reflections-of-a-nonpolitical-man-thomas-mann.html

A new festival at Little Island, a birthday celebration for Twyla Tharp — and the return of all the things you’ve missed.","When the world shut down last year, whole slates of professional dance programming evaporated overnight. Yet suddenly everyone was dancing: at virtual dance parties and in TikTok challenges, in the swelling crowds at social justice protests, in the streets as election results rolled in. This fall dance is back onstage, with theaters and companies (optimistically) planning busy seasons. Much of the programming feels like business as usual, but some artists are channeling the energy of the moment, reimagining dances created online during shutdowns as live pieces, or bringing the cathartic power of protest dance to the stage. (Theaters may require audience members to show proof of vaccination, and live performances are still subject to change because of Covid; check websites for updated information.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/arts/dance/fall-dance-calendar.html

While there’s certainly an uptick of shows featuring women and artists of color in this fall preview, there are also many, delayed by Covid-19, that were planned several years ago.

2021-09-27,A Cartier Tiara for Life’s Grandest Occasions,This diamond-encrusted diadem is sure to be the crowning glory of any royal fantasy.,"A tiara is never worn casually. Unlike a necklace or bracelet, which can be little more than a simple rope or chain offhandedly draped around the neck or wrist, diadems are, by definition, grand. The early Greeks replaced laurel and olive wreaths with gold versions in increasingly complex styles. During the 18th century, gemstones became the focus and the tiara morphed from a unisex accouterment into a female-identified one. Napoleon, a die-hard neo-classicist, was a particular champion — he lavished tiaras on both wives — as was Queen Victoria, whose example was followed by the ladies of her court. This design, by Cartier, the Paris-based house that has been crafting tiaras since the turn of the 20th century — including the 1936 Halo commissioned by King George VI for his wife, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and later worn by Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, at her wedding in 2011 — continues that tradition. Made of 18-karat white-gold arabesques and adorned with diamonds in cushion, square and brilliant cuts, it brings fantasy, and history’s most regal moments, vividly alive.

2021-09-27,Why We Can’t Quit Muhammad Ali,He’s our favorite combatant-saint.,"In the opener to his 1949 essay “Reflections on Gandhi,” George Orwell wrote, “Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.” He followed with a somewhat meandering, brilliant guide on how to think not just about Gandhi but about all people who have been practically beatified for their work on Earth. As with all of Orwell’s nonfiction work, “Reflections” bristles with a restless, contrarian energy that refuses to accept any party line about its subject and tries — desperately, at times — to place Gandhi within a capacious yet still critical context. How do you offer him credit for his bravery and the righteousness of his cause while still offering him the respect to wrestle with his ideas? “One may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for Gandhi,” Orwell concluded. “One may reject the claims of sainthood made on his behalf (he never made any such claim himself, by the way), one may also reject sainthood as an ideal and therefore feel that Gandhi’s basic aims were anti-human and reactionary, but regarded simply as a politician, and compared with the other leading political figures of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to leave behind!”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/opinion/muhammad-ali-burns.html

Make them with pastrami from Katz’s Delicatessen and Hendrick’s Gin, and you can tie them together with a special edition of Katz’s pickles brined with the juniper berries, cubeb berries and coriander used in Hendrick’s, a gin famously infused with cucumber, the key pickle ingredient. The collaboration between Jake Dell, the owner of Katz’s, and Lesley Gracie, the master distiller at Hendrick’s, came about as an April Fools’ gag. This year, Hendrick’s posted a recipe for gin-infused pickles on Instagram without any intention of selling them. But the response was such that they ended up working with Katz’s.

He bought a few big copper-lined vats that a Comté cheese maker in the Jura region of eastern France no longer uses because they have transitioned to larger equipment. The secondhand vats, which can handle 3,000 liters (3,170 quarts) of milk, replace Mr. Kehler’s smaller vessels. Most importantly they are engineered so the curds are transferred to a vacuum system by gravity to the lower level of the creamery where they are pressed and formed, and no longer require the hands-on chore of moving the curds manually. “It’s automated, easier to clean, there’s no waste, we can make more cheese and they will be more consistent,” he said.

Most are classics like pan con tomate, potato tortilla, garlic shrimp, meatballs and salt cod croquettes. Somewhat more substantial are plates of chicken with sweet pepper sauce and almonds, squid or octopus with potatoes and peppers, and, serving two, a socarrat, which is crispy paella rice with seafood and aioli. Must-have desserts are churros, crema catalana, and chocolate cream with olive oil, salt and almonds. Most of the wines, ciders and beers and even many spirits on the deep list come from Spain and were assembled by the beverage consultant Eamon Rockey. He has also created the cocktails, often with a Spanish twist including sherry. Seating is on an elevated area on one side of the market, with outdoor tables, too.

These stories, with their inevitable triumph-over-odds arc, were our firmament, but they also felt slightly apocryphal; when he told them, we were aware of witnessing a kind of performance, and that was probably why they gave us the giggles: the rhetorical flourish of certain repeated details — the juice of the raw onion “dribbling down his chin”; driving the car “in first gear the whole way.” At the same time, we sensed something real in his need to re-enact the same memories again and again in his effort to reconcile the genuine hardships of his past with a dissonant present embodied in his young grandchildren, indifferent to their apple-eating good fortune.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/t-magazine/memoirs-books-nonfiction-identity.html
