I was curious for any glimpse into my grandmother’s mind during this chapter of her life when she was an expressionist dancer in Hamburg and sported boyish haircuts and berets. She had recently fallen in love with my grandfather Hermann and was summoning the courage to divorce her husband. From Wikipedia I learned that “Gilgi” was the first novel by a writer named Irmgard Keun (1905-82), who had been the It Girl of the German literary scene in the final years of the Weimar Republic. Intrigued, I ordered a copy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/irmgard-keun-gilgi.html

I, for one, was hoping the answer would not involve a book aimed at teenagers in which a candidate’s obscene reference to female anatomy appears on Page 2, but that is where we are. In UNPRESIDENTED: A Biography of Donald Trump (Feiwel and Friends, 384 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), Martha Brockenbrough provides an encyclopedic tale of the rise of Donald J. Trump. Brockenbrough’s version is, unapologetically, a liberal’s framing of events. Then again, I’m not sure if a nonpartisan book about Trump could grow out of the current climate. For now, there is this thorough, hard-hitting volume that seeks to explain Trump, from the time he was born with a silver spoon and “golden hair, pink cheeks and a tiny pucker of a mouth,” to his shocker of a presidential campaign (“candidates typically don’t insult the parents of soldiers who die in combat”).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/unpresidented-martha-brockenbrough.html

He knew enough about the topic that these psychologists and neuroscientists and physicians and anthropologists and philosophers had come to his city to talk about — the placebo effect, the phenomenon whereby suffering people get better from treatments that have no discernible reason to work — to call it “fake medicine,” and to add that it probably works because “people like to be cheated.” He took a beat. “But in the end, I believe that honesty will prevail.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html

2018-11-08,How Does a Museum Buy an Artwork That Doesn’t Physically Exist?,The Hirshhorn Museum’s purchase of a piece by Tino Sehgal reveals a different kind of acquisition process.,"THE ARTIST TINO SEHGAL believes there are enough objects in the world. His art involves people, not things, and the process of selling it is entirely verbal. Sehgal does not issue receipts. He does not permit his work to be photographed or filmed, nor does he produce catalogs or even wall labels to accompany his exhibitions. In fact, he eschews all forms of documentation, written or otherwise, in relation to the sale, presentation and care of his work. His pieces, which he calls “constructed situations,” usually involve “players” or “participants” who have been trained by the artist to enact specific actions. At the 2005 Venice Biennale, in a piece titled “This Is So Contemporary,” participants dressed as security guards leapt around visitors to the German Pavilion chanting, “Ooh, this is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!” before resuming nonchalant poses. For a 2010 show at the Guggenheim Museum called “This Progress,” a series of increasingly older interpreters guided visitors up the museum’s spiraled rotunda while carrying on free-form conversations that began with the visitor’s personal definition of progress. His most famous work, “Kiss,” from 2002, involves a man and a woman recreating iconic embraces from artworks throughout history, inspired by oeuvres as distinct as those of Auguste Rodin and Jeff Koons, on the floor of an exhibition space.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/t-magazine/tino-sehgal-hirshhorn-museum-art.html

This One Just Might","“The Letter for the King,” by the Dutch author Tonke Dragt, gets a new English edition 56 years after it first appeared. It’s a straightforward story with buckets of charm on its side.","Whether or not it is an entirely admirable thing, it is certainly an arresting thing that Tonke Dragt’s THE LETTER FOR THE KING (Pushkin Children’s Books, 512 pp., paper, $15.95; ages 10 and up), newly republished in English in a translation by Laura Watkinson, has as literal a title as has ever been imagined by an author for an adventure story. We expect the titles of children’s classics to be deliberately intriguing, marked by an unexpected metaphysical juxtaposition — a witch meets a wardrobe — or at least to suggest an intriguing concept, time wrinkling or a philosopher’s stone sought. But Dragt’s book promises to be about a letter, for some king, and that is exactly its chief and only matter. The question is if it can be delivered or not.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/books/review/tongke-dragt-letter-for-the-king.html

2018-11-14,A Letter to the Army: Don’t Punish the Man Who Led the Mission That Killed My Son,The father of one of the American soldiers killed in Niger last year writes a letter of support for the Army captain who led the fateful mission.,"After multiple investigations into the ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead last year, the United States Army punished several people who were involved in the mission, including the two soldiers who led the 11-man team when militants attacked it. Those punished were not reprimanded for what happened during the ambush but rather what led up to it, including poor training alongside Nigerien troops, a lack of pre-mission rehearsals and what investigators called a misleading mission plan. The leader of the Special Forces team, Capt. Mike Perozeni, along with his second in command, received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand, known as a GOMOR. A reprimand’s impact is based on where it is placed in a soldier’s file. If the letter is considered “local,” it will disappear after the soldier changes jobs. If it is permanent, it likely means the end of a career. The soldier, and others on his behalf, can write a rebuttal. Below is a letter written on behalf of Captain Perozeni by Henry Black, the father of Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, one of the four soldiers killed in the ambush. A version of this letter was delivered to Maj. Gen. Edwin J. Deedrick Jr., the commanding officer of the First Special Forces Command, who administered the letters. With Black’s permission, it has been lightly edited for clarity and to protect the identity of some of the soldiers, whose names have not been released.

2018-11-16,"Beyond Battles, Boogers and Pranks","Now that my son can read, I want him to seek out books about more than just winning things and getting easy laughs. Why does that seem hard?","One of my son’s favorite books last year was Cece Bell’s graphic novel “El Deafo,” an emotionally complex story about a girl contending with hearing loss, a new school and the trap of a bad friendship. Several boys in his second-grade class also found “El Deafo” a rewarding change from the usual fare recommended to them — those ubiquitous series that deliver endless action and flatulence jokes. For my son and his friends, it didn’t matter that the narrator of “El Deafo” is a girl, or that there is no galactic warfare to be found, no plotline about defeating others. Seeing them connect so strongly with this nuanced, absorbing novel made me wonder why boys at this age — the “chapter book” years, when they’re reading on their own, but not full-on novels — are pushed mostly toward shallow books full of battles, boogers and pranks.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/books/review/beyond-gender-stereotypes-boys.html

Your eyes leap up, and turn left, and then there’s a sort of guitar fretwork that you must navigate, which seems to have been made with the help of a ruler. Then comes a wiggly bit. Followed by another left turn, a sharp left, and then a hard right. Very soon the eye gives up, overwhelmed by distractions. The lines transgress and bisect themselves.

2018-11-19,Two Pioneering Artists Discuss Motherhood and Machismo,"Phyllida Barlow and Anna Maria Maiolino, who have both received full recognition for their work late in life, sit down for a conversation about their careers.","The artists Phyllida Barlow and Anna Maria Maiolino grew up continents apart, but they share a language of mud and cement, life cycles and rebirths. Barlow, 74, is a British artist renowned for her often-soaring sculptures cobbled together from industrial refuse, as though an ordinary urban street had suddenly come alive and risen up into a sentient colossus. Maiolino, 76, is an Italian, São Paulo-based artist celebrated for her modeled- and rolled-clay installations and sculptures that suggest the work of “a housewife gone mad,” as the curator Helen Molesworth once put it, and evoke everything from human organs, phalluses and rolls of bread to prehistoric worms. Barlow had a traditional arts education at London’s Chelsea College of Arts, followed by the Slade. Maiolino had a very nontraditional upbringing and education, migrating with her family from Italy to Venezuela during World War II, and then from Venezuela to Brazil, where her performances, videos and works on paper contributed, alongside work by Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, to the Neo-Concrete and New Objectivity movements at a time of political upheaval in Brazil. (She audited classes at an art school in Rio de Janeiro but considers herself largely self-taught.) Both artists are mothers, and both received full recognition for their pioneering work late in life — and continue to make work in their 70s as a matter of some urgency. This month, their artworks are on view in concurrent solo exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth in New York, where we met on a brisk fall morning. There, the two artists sat down together to talk about their work and lives for the first time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/t-magazine/phyllida-barlow-anna-maria-maiolino-conversation-art.html

A quirky approach for a quirky topic. FREAK KINGDOM By Timothy Denevi. (PublicAffairs, $28.) Beyond the drugs and gonzo journalism, Hunter S. Thompson was a fierce opponent of corruption and the authoritarian tendencies of political leaders. This is what most motivated his writing, Denevi argues in a new biography of the bombastic writer. THE NEW ORDER By Karen Bender. (Counterpoint, $26.) A finalist for the National Book Award, lauded for her short stories, Bender returns with a collection that reflects America’s new reality. One story takes place after a school shooting, another centers on a woman grappling with unemployment. MUCK By Dror Burstein, translated by Gabriel Levin. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.) Burstein is one of the most experimental and exciting Israeli novelists writing today. His new book is a reworking of the Book of Jeremiah tinged with much surreality — there are talking dogs and cunneiform tattoos. HEIRS OF THE FOUNDERS By H. W. Brands. (Doubleday, $30.) Brands, a two-time Pulitzer finalist, has turned to the generation of American political leaders who arrived in the wake of the founding fathers and dominated the first half of the 19th century.

2018-11-20,"Rufus Wainwright and Ivo van Hove Talk Politics, Coming Out and Boarding School",Two creative people in two different fields in one wide-ranging conversation. This time: the singer and the director.,"What does the Belgian dramatist Ivo van Hove have in common with the American-Canadian singer Rufus Wainwright? For one, they’re both artists whose gay identity is neither incidental to their work nor all-consuming. For another, they are both tireless artistic explorers, catholic in the extreme. Wainwright, son of the ’70s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 “Want” albums. Then he decided to write operas — the second, “Hadrian,” with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October — and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson’s 2009 staging of Shakespeare’s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose “The Crucible” and “A View From the Bridge” he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered “A Little Life,” adapted from the novel written by T’s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet’s prescient 1976 media satire, “Network” (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, “Sword of Damocles,” as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self — and the benefits of boarding school.

He had been invited to give a talk during Bergman Week, an annual festival at which fans attend lectures and screenings and go on “Bergman Safaris,” driving on one-lane roads to the pebbly coasts and placid cabins where many of the Swedish director’s films were made. Lanthimos explored the Bergman residence with its clean lines and windows opening directly onto the Baltic Sea, examining notes in the director’s own handwriting scrawled directly upon the furniture (“I’m successful at my career, and I’m still sleepless”). He saw an original print of “Persona” in the 15-seat private theater, where Bergman’s ample leather recliner is always left empty in the front of the room, and even viewed a segment from one of his own works (“Dogtooth,” his second film), something he hardly ever does. While editing, he watches each film over and over, so by the time it’s ready to be shown, he “can’t wait until it’s the last time, for at least 10, 15 years.” His reaction was similar to the one he’d once had while rewatching “Kinetta,” his first movie: “Strange, strange, but not so bad, really.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/magazine/yorgos-lanthimoss-director-favourite.html

As he surveyed the herd, an idea struck: “Human baby hair is infinitely softer than an adult’s. The same is probably true of baby goats.” Thus was born baby cashmere, made from the almost-weightless inner coat of the kid, available only once in each animal’s lifetime, when they are between 3 and 8 months old. Each produces a mere single ounce of strands that average only 13.5 microns (or about 0.0005 inches) in diameter; it takes 19 ounces to make a single sweater. “Holding one of these small creatures in my arms, I had the same emotion as when I hold a baby,” Loro Piana says. “It’s a symbol of purity.” Here is the small collection of species that Loro Piana uses to create most of its textiles.

He returned to Europe two years later, eventually landing as the head of accessories at Givenchy and then at Louis Vuitton, where Marc Jacobs was his mentor. With the launches of Givenchy’s pumpkin bags and the multicolor monograms Takashi Murakami collaborated on with Louis Vuitton, Vevers became synonymous with the early 2000s It-bag phenomenon and was hired to reinvigorate Mulberry in 2004, followed by Loewe in 2007. Those roles made him an obvious choice for Coach, the American heritage brand that got its start in 1941 producing billfolds and briefcases inspired by baseball gloves. “Although I use our history as a jumping-off point, I felt we needed to radically catapult forward,” says Vevers, 45. “On day one, I decided to think beyond just accessories.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/t-magazine/stuart-vevers-coach-inspiration.html

2018-11-27,Taiwanese Fried Chicken and Bubble Tea Head to the Flatiron District,"A new boutique restaurant in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a seasonal pop-up in Williamsburg, and more restaurant news.","This new eat-in, take-out spot is a Taiwanese doubleheader. Kung Fu Tea, a Taiwanese-style bubble tea company that started in 2010 in Flushing, Queens, and now has 200 outlets in 30 states, has joined forces with TKK Fried Chicken, a chain founded in 1974 in Taiwan. The Taiwanese recipe called “original” on the menu is crisp and moderately spiced. There is also a milder version and, for the American market, a crisper, more forcefully seasoned one. How is this fried chicken different from the Korean variety found all over New York? “Taiwanese fried chicken is first marinated for 24 hours to add flavor,” said Steven Luw, the general operating manager. “Then it gets a flour breading and is fried once. Korean fried chicken is usually dipped in batter and fried twice.” The company, which will count this location as its first American restaurant in addition to the 68 branches it has in Taiwan and Shanghai, is also offering items that are not on the menu in Asia, including curly fries, a fried chicken sandwich, chunky coleslaw, Wisconsin-style cheese curds, biscuits and seared shishito peppers. The bubble tea partnership provides many colorful teas with optional toppings like red beans and crushed Oreos, served at varying sweetness, iced to hot. Beer and wine are also served. The bright space has tables in front and back separated by an open kitchen and ordering counter. It took but a few minutes during a recent trial period for this place to become a canteen for nearby Baruch College students.

2018-11-28,How the Myth of the Hedonistic Artist Lost Its Allure,These days — despite longstanding clichés about art and excess — the creative impulse can actually be more closely tied to asceticism.,"A PREVAILING NOTION of the lives of artists holds that hedonism is a meaningful part of production. The slide projector on the subject has no shortage of famous faces: There’s boozy Faulkner, banging out novels and screenplays while pickled, and Dorothy Parker and Jackson Pollock, producing their poems and paintings alongside the empty bottles, not to mention those libertine de Sades, Baudelaires and Byrons, who were all about sex and drugs long before rock ’n’ roll introduced the idea that heroin was the magic juice of musical genius, one that spit out Hendrix and Joplin on one sad side and a sober Keith Richards on the happy other. The notion is nothing new. In classical Greece, in fourth- and fifth-century Athens, the major artistic prize of the era, for drama, was given under the auspices of Dionysus, a god of wine and ecstasy. Dionysus is a curious proto-patron saint of the arts, given the story of his birth. Zeus — king of gods, thunder god — wooed the mortal Semele. Hera, Zeus’ wife and the goddess of heaven, tired of her husband’s philandering, learned of Zeus’ latest conquest and convinced Semele to demand that Zeus reveal his true form — lightning — a sight Hera knew would kill her: No mortal can bear a god in full. Zeus assented, Semele died, but Zeus saved Semele’s fetal son, tucking him into his thigh, carrying him to term, earning the child the epithet “twice born”: to a mortal, to a god.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/t-magazine/artists-abstinence-asceticism.html

The first, “Folly,” is the story of a love affair. It narrates the relationship between Alice, a book editor and aspiring writer in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a brilliant, geriatric novelist who is partly modeled on Philip Roth. The second section — “Madness” — belongs to Amar Jaafari, an Iraqi-American economist who is being detained at Heathrow. Halliday’s prose is clean and lean, almost reportorial in the style of W.G. Sebald. This is a first novel that reads like the work of an author who has published many books over many years, and it manages to be, all at once, a transgressive roman à clef, a novel of ideas and a politically engaged work of metafiction.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/books/review/best-books.html

A modern woman can imagine her own version of it, though. At Chloé’s spring show, for example, models wore a more low-key, but still bouncy, sweptback look. Grand-scale hair looks current and youthful when it’s done with a rakish, imperfect finish, says the mononymous New York-based hairstylist Garren.

Yet to think this way ignores evidence to the contrary — evidence in the form of human lives. One of the great paradoxes of America is that we could be a country that elected its first black president, one whose term saw, yes, a radically more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but also one of the worst school shootings in our history, a mass shooting at a gay nightclub and multiple murders of unarmed black boys and men, shot because of who they were, not what they did. Crucially, that president’s reactions to these horrors were markedly different than those of our current president to similar incidents, but the fact remains that no era since our founding has been free of these contradictions (indeed, these murders that occurred during the previous administration were not new developments — it was technology that enabled their immediate and widespread dissemination).

It is comfort, escapism and reassurance in a troubling world. It is generic in the truest sense, a genre defined and constrained by a handful of conventions. The heart of every romance is a love story, and by the last page of the book the lovers wind up together, happily ever after or at least “happily for now.” (Less codified but no less crucial is that no children or pets are harmed. This is a place for happy endings, after all.) These rules give rise to a rich variety of stories, but they are constraints nonetheless.

2018-11-30,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Some fiction writers try to capture reality, using stories to illuminate social conditions or plumb interior lives. Others just like to make up crazy things. (And also illuminate social conditions and interior lives, yes! Don’t @ us.) We like both kinds of fiction around here, but our picks this week decidedly, and determinedly, range beyond the bounds of conventional realism. There’s an austere little fairy tale about the chaos of sexual desire, “The Governesses.” There’s a turbulent, myth-inflected debut that made its author the youngest-ever finalist for the Booker Prize, “Everything Under.” There’s a dystopian New York story about consumerism and immigration, “Severance,” and a surreal Japanese story collection, “The Lonesome Bodybuilder,” that shakes up narrative expectations right alongside social expectations about gender and marriage and body image. And while Louisa Hall’s “Trinity” would seem to be more traditional than any of those — it’s a biographical, historical novel about Robert Oppenheimer and his work on the atomic bomb — even that goes about it in a nontraditional way.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

One of two books reviewed in Ed Park’s Graphic Content column.","Every 40 pages or so in Jason Lutes’s BERLIN (Drawn + Quarterly, $49.95), a sequence appears that seems to hold the key to this massive graphic novel. In one of the earliest, a drawing instructor stands before a chalkboard, lecturing on the use of perspective. “The observer’s location is what really determines the placement of a vanishing point,” he explains, and asks his students to consider the views out of three adjacent windows in the studio. “Stand still in front of each and imagine it as a framed picture.” The same scene looks different depending on the observer’s position. It’s a metaphor, of course, for the book itself — an opus of more than 500 pages set in the late 1920s in the titular city, teeming with journalists and junkmen, artists and runaways, fiery rabble-rousers and burnt-out cases from the First World War, perceiving the city with their own nervous systems.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/books/review/jason-lutes-berlin.html

He released the album “Universal Beings” in October to wide acclaim.,"On a rainy evening in August of last year, a barely advertised show by the Chicago-based drummer and beatsmith Makaya McCraven jammed an overflow crowd into H0L0, a sparse little basement club in Ridgewood, Queens. His band was a group of New York musicians, some of whom Mr. McCraven had hardly played with before; what they performed was entirely improvised, but with Mr. McCraven subtly steering, listeners had room to get comfortable, to fall into the music. His thick snare drum splattered against the bulb tones of Joel Ross’s vibraphone patterns, making an elliptical groove. Sometimes Brandee Younger’s plucks on the harp led Mr. McCraven into a buoyant, driving beat. Elsewhere, he minimized himself, letting Dezron Douglas’s bass guide the rhythm.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/music/makaya-mccraven-universal-beings.html
