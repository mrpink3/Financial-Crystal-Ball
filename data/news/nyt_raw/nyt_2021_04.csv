2021-04-05,A New Pasta Shape for Your Pantry,Cascatelli was invented after three years of research and development by Sfoglini and the podcast host Dan Pashman.,"Add cascatelli — inspired by the Italian word for waterfall, cascata — to your pasta vocabulary and your pantry. This new pasta shape was invented after three years of research and development by Dan Pashman, the host of the podcast The Sporkful, with the expertise of Sfoglini, a pasta company based in West Coxsackie, N.Y., in the Hudson Valley. The creation story has been documented on Mr. Pashman’s podcast as “Mission: Impastable.” He insisted on a shape that could be speared with a fork, and that would hold sauce well and have a proper bite. Traditionally extruded pasta shapes are made by forcing the dough through a die; a new, high-quality bronze die was made for cascatelli. The shape is a bit larger than most short pastas, but it’s very good, especially for simpler, less ingredient-heavy sauces like marinara, carbonara, pesto and arrabbiata.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/dining/sfoglini-pasta-shape.html

These findings paved the way for other holistic disciplines, including today’s forest medicine (the study of how wooded environments improve health) and ecotherapy (which considers the curative potential of natural settings).",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/t-magazine/forest-bathing-beauty.html

I hadn’t liked Dickie much: He once called me a name that was shorthand for “dirty Jew.” His family, then? My mother had hinted, perhaps for my sake because I was a junior hypochondriac, that the Powerses lacked access to adequate medical care: Dickie died because he was poor. My mother, too, had grown up poor; she’d lived above a dime store, dying to get out. I wondered if that was why, aside from it being November, my parents sent his parents a turkey.

He was 32, about the same age I was at the time, and wore a baggy black hoodie, trousers and thick, white-framed glasses. He kept his hair longer in the front so that a thicket of bangs swept just past his left eyebrow. He was tall, and if you looked closely, he was attractive. But it was hard to notice that because he was quiet and looked as if he wanted to shrink into himself, like a teenage boy who’d shot up over the span of the summer.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/12/t-magazine/long-distance-friends.html

I was doing a fitting for Marc Jacobs’s fall 2017 runway show, and couldn’t understand what anyone was saying and why I was waiting around for three hours. It was nothing like Seoul Fashion Week. My phone died. I started to panic. But then, another Korean model approached me and comforted me. She invited me to sit with her and let me borrow her phone charger. She translated the announcements and told me when it was my turn to be fitted. That woman was HoYeon Jung — she was a year older than I was, and it was her third New York Fashion Week. In Korean culture, we take care of each other, especially when we’re working overseas. We commute to fittings and eat together between shows. I met EZ six years ago at a party in Seoul, and when we went to New York for fashion week, we lived together for the whole season and got really close. I met Chloe recently in New York, but I already consider her a younger sister. What I’ve longed for over the past year has been that sense of community, of going out in Seoul with EZ and my other model friends, like Sora Choi and Yoon Young Bae. We’d meet in Gangnam, where most of us live, and from there we’d have dinner — usually street food, like tteokbokki [a spicy rice cake], dakbal [spicy chicken feet] or Korean barbecue — then bowling, karaoke and bar hopping until we’d end up at one of our apartments to play drinking games and card games, like Go Stop.

Documenting these relationships “was not without its challenges,” says T’s creative director, Patrick Li. “To shoot groups around the world during this time requires tremendous coordination.” It was a logistical feat accomplished by T’s photo department, which spent much of the past year vigilantly tracking shutdowns worldwide, following both government and C.D.C. guidelines and organizing shoots as states and countries reopened. Arranging these shoots — which took place over the course of six-and-a-half months (from August 2020 to early March of this year) in Portugal, Spain, Sicily, London, Berlin, São Paulo, New York, Los Angeles, Seoul, and Paris and on Grand Cayman — required hours of planning, and a checklist of previously unheard-of safety measures.

But lightning doesn’t always strike on initial acquaintance. In a 1917 diary entry, a 35-year-old Virginia Woolf didn’t mince words in her impression of the New Zealand-born Modernist writer Katherine Mansfield at a dinner party: “She stinks like a … civet cat that had taken to streetwalking.” Despite Mansfield’s shocking “commonness,” Woolf went on, “when this diminishes, she is so intelligent and inscrutable that she repays friendship.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/12/t-magazine/friendship-art-creative-partnerships.html

He met Boardman in 1994, after receiving an invite to Paper’s 10th-anniversary bash. “Michael and Bill Cunningham were, to me, the legendary documenters of downtown culture,” says Boardman, who was subsequently introduced to Yaeger by Lauren Ezersky, the host of the television series “Behind the Velvet Ropes,” after she spotted the two aboard a long-since-retired Fashion Week bus that carried attendees from show to show.

But when you immerse yourself in the shifting perspectives of CATHEDRAL (Europa, 624 pp., $28), what you also discover is a clever (even postmodern?) commentary on the ironies of history. As he traces the fates of a lively scrum of characters, Hopkins shows how the seemingly firm hierarchies of one era can be grounded in the social strife — and sometimes sheer luck — of those that came before. In this nimble mesh of stories, a trading empire can have its roots in something as simple as the theft of a wig.

Although his political views have always been conservative, he has also always believed in kindness and fairness. Since the start of the pandemic, his social interactions have become severely reduced, limited to daily calls from me (I live across the country), weekly visits from my brother and the occasional shopping trips and church attendance. As our mother passed away before the pandemic, his one loyal companion has been his iPad and YouTube. Because of his viewing of religious programs, YouTube has increasingly steered him toward conservative media, so that he is now obsessed with right-wing extremist politics and is absolutely against taking the Covid vaccine. Every time my brother or I have a conversation with him, he talks politics and pushes his views, and even after we asked him to stop, he tries to get the last word in by sending us angry emails or texts. Now both of us try to avoid having any interactions with him. I have the password to his YouTube account from a year ago when I helped him with a tech problem. In order to preserve our relationship, I’m thinking about going into his account to delete and pause his viewing history, and perhaps put in some links to more wholesome entertainment such as music and soccer to counter the constant bombardment of extremism. My justification is that if he is being brainwashed by an algorithm, then I might as well use the algorithm to steer him back to his old self so that we can at least have a normal conversation.

2021-04-22,An Acorn Jelly That Brings Michelle Zauner Back,The musician and memoirist rediscovered this favorite from her childhood while on a recent trip to Seoul.,"During a three-week visit to Seoul in May 2019, the musician Michelle Zauner saw the city in a nostalgic light. She was staying in an apartment in the Gangnam district to complete the first draft of her memoir, “Crying in H Mart,” following a tour in Asia with her solo indie-pop project, Japanese Breakfast. Though Zauner, 32, grew up in Eugene, Ore., she was born in Seoul, and revisiting the food of her childhood — particularly dotorimuk-muchim, or seasoned acorn jelly, which she ordered often from a noodle restaurant near the apartment — caused new emotions to surface. Traditionally made from foraged acorns that are shelled, dried, ground into a powdery starch, cooked in water and served cold as banchan, or a side dish, its gelatinous texture and earthy flavor triggered a visceral response, first at her fingertips, then on her tongue. “It reminded me of my enduring struggle as a child to keep the slippery bricks between my chopsticks,” Zauner says, adding that the dish is “almost like a Korean aspic, but healthier.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/t-magazine/michelle-zauner-recipe-crying-hmart.html

Tudor kings and queens cavort cartoonishly across 16-foot-wide, unprimed canvases. Disembodied mouths chomp through exploding cookies. Celebrities, cinematic characters and figures from commercials often appear: stars from Quentin Tarantino films with hulking shoulders and slender legs; Lolita-like blondes in sunglasses; Serena Williams hammering a tennis ball into the air.

2021-04-23,10 Queer Indigenous Artists on Where Their Inspirations Have Led Them,"While wide-ranging in scope and style, these pieces are alike in their power and depth.","Though the pandemic’s grip is starting to loosen, and relief finally feels within reach, this past year has underscored our country’s long history of violence, new examples of which serve as reminders of older ones. Among them are the myriad atrocities perpetuated against Indigenous people in what we now call America (and beyond), individuals whose experiences are to this day too often distorted or left untold. Lately, though, there have been some hard-won gains on that front, from professional sports teams finally changing their names to the Metropolitan Museum of Art hiring Patricia Marroquin Norby as its first curator of Native American Art. It is not necessarily the job of the artist to shine a light where others have not, but self-expression — especially that of individuals who, whether because of their race, gender, sexuality or any other marker of identity, some might seek to deny — can be an inherently radical act, one to which attention should be paid. For this story, we asked 10 queer Indigenous talents from different parts of North America to share one of their artworks and talk about its genesis, and about their practice at large. Like the selections themselves, the conversations, which touched on materials, color schemes, gender fluidity, decolonization, oral history and more, were testaments to the strength — and beauty — of a multiplicity of voices.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/t-magazine/queer-indigenous-artists.html

He closed Lupulo more than three years ago and Aldea a little over a year ago after a 10-year run, because he felt that he needed a break. Now, he will be the chef and a partner at this new SoHo restaurant. He will be running it with David Rabin, a hospitality veteran who is also a partner in the Lambs Club, the new Sona and others. “I always knew I’d be back,” Mr. Mendes said. “I’ve spent the past year cooking at home, baking sourdough and exploring new flavors, and I’m ready to translate them to a restaurant.” Veranda is in the new ModernHaus hotel, a property that was the James, and has been completely reconfigured. Veranda’s main dining room is up from the street, and designed in greenhouse fashion with a retractable ceiling. It’s surrounded by outdoor seating on an upper terrace and a multilevel garden. Mr. Mendes’s menu is global but lightly strewn with Portuguese touches. Think flor de sal (fleur de sel) and olive oil for the sourdough bread, salt cod croquettes, Goan curry for shrimp, and a piri piri marinade used on grilled chicken. Chicken rice is his take on paella. He also delivers seasonality with all the green stuff you hunger for right now. “I’ve been cooking farm-to-table since I worked at Bouley and in France,” he said. “The bounty is incredible now.” A number of products, including the sourdough bread, are sold to take home.
