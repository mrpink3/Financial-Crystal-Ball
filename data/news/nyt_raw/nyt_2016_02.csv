2016-02-01,Janet Napolitano Reviews Peter Bergen’s ‘United States of Jihad’,A study seeks answers to why some ‘ordinary’ citizens become jihadists. ,"Who constitutes a homegrown jihadist, and what distinguishes the terrorist attack in San Bernardino from the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School? In post-9/11 America, questions like these shape our national discourse on terrorism, law enforcement and public safety. Peter Bergen, CNN’s national security analyst and the author of four other books on terrorism, addresses these and other salient questions in his excellent new “United States of Jihad: Investigating America’s Homegrown Terrorists.” Bergen seeks to understand why some Americans choose to become jihadists, how our institutions have responded to terrorism and how American society has been changed by terrorist threats. Terrorism has long existed in this country — Bergen describes the 1970s as the “golden age” of terrorism in the United States — but the horrific attacks of Sept. 11 and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives on American soil were to earlier terrorist attacks as a tsunami is to a high tide. Just as a tsunami leaves a landscape forever altered once it retreats, so too has Sept. 11 fundamentally changed America. The difficulty Bergen faces in mapping and analyzing post-9/11 homegrown terrorism is the ever shifting, contemporaneous terrain of his subject — it’s a bit like writing a history of the 1960s while the Beatles are still singing. Nonetheless, Bergen’s book is the best one-volume treatment available on the current state of jihad in America.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/united-states-of-jihad-by-peter-bergen.html

That ‘‘shouldn’t be unusual,’’ says Williams, ‘‘but it is.’’ She fields a lot of questions about her continued success: ‘‘Basically, what they’re saying is, how come you haven’t fizzled out?’’ In fact, Williams feels like she’s in the prime of her career, a theory borne out by her 12th studio album, ‘‘The Ghosts of Highway 20,’’ also out this month, on which her famously ragged voice is rougher and more compelling than ever. A major influence on both Raitt and Williams is Loretta Lynn, who at 83 is releasing ‘‘Full Circle,’’ her first album since her 2004 collaboration with Jack White, in March. ‘‘As long as I’m on this earth,’’ she said recently, ‘‘I will try to be on top somewhere.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/t-magazine/entertainment/bonnie-raitt-lucinda-williams-loretta-lynn-new-albums.html

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Arkadi Zaides, one of the few Israeli choreographers explicitly grappling with politics in his work, presents “Archive,” featuring film footage from Gaza.

But the Target Margin Theater, known for radically reinventing classic behemoths, is not about to be daunted by a little excess weight. (Last year, it hoisted the dense literary conundrums of Gertrude Stein.) The company begins a two-season project devoted to O’Neill with a series of works that excavate and abstract the unwieldy “Electra” under the title “Drunken With What” at the Abrons Arts Center. As the name suggests, the lines between the muse and the bottle in O’Neill’s work will be considered, though in separate, cocktail-size gulps instead of a marathon binge. David Herskovits, Target Margin’s founder and artistic director, presides as spiritual bartender and mixologist.

2016-02-05,Inside the List,Roz Chast’s memoir of her parents’ deaths is one of several nuanced considerations of family and mortality on the hardcover graphics list.,"The Cartoonist’s Elegy: Between romance novels and mysteries, love and death have long ruled the fiction lists. But they’re increasingly common in hardcover graphics as well: On this week’s list, nuanced considerations of family and mortality turn up in Adrian Tomine’s story collection “Killing and Dying” (No. 8 after 17 weeks); Tom Hart’s memoir “Rosalie Lightning,” about the death of his 1-year-old daughter (No. 6 after three weeks); and — the book that arguably paved the way in this regard — Roz Chast’s memoir of her parents’ deaths, “Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?” (No. 4 after 91 weeks). Chast’s memoir was chosen as one of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books in 2014, when we wrote that “cartoons, it turns out, are ­tailor-made for the absurdities of old age, illness and dementia.” But the book is equally moving as an account of Chast’s relationship with her parents — in particular her difficult, complicated mother. “I’ve been aware of issues with my mother since I was a little kid,” Chast told me recently via email. “The book didn’t really help me come to terms with them. There are certain things that don’t work out in life, and writing a book is an interesting way to look at those things and think about them. And I’m aware it could have been much, much worse. She had a lot of wonderful qualities: She was strong-willed and very smart. I’ve been told by her former students that she was the best teacher they ever had. But being a mom, which to me is a combination of strength but also flexibility — sometimes a lot of flexibility — was something that didn’t really interest her.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/inside-the-list.html

It showed a crowd of Chinese watching while one of their compatriots was beheaded by the Japanese, accused of being a Russian spy. “They were all strong fellows but appeared completely apathetic,” Zhou recalled. “After this film I felt that medical science was not so important after all. The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they may be, can only serve to be made examples of, or to witness such futile spectacles. . . . The most important thing, therefore, was to change their spirit, and since at that time I felt that literature was the best means to this end, I determined to promote a literary movement.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/the-big-red-book-of-modern-chinese-literature-edited-by-yunte-huang.html

One of the intellectuals, Laura ­Secor writes in “Children of Paradise,” an engrossing but narrowly focused history of the Iranian reform movement, was Abdolkarim Soroush, a champion of the ­Austrian-British philosopher of science and open-society advocate Karl Popper. Farsi translations of Popper’s works were flying off the shelves. But they were being savaged in the press by devotees of Soroush’s rival, Ahmad Fardid, who espoused the views of Martin Heidegger. Many hard-liners in the Islamic Republic were attracted to Heidegger, the midcentury German thinker tainted by his ties to Nazism, as a counter to Western scientific rationalism’s claims to universalism. “Because both philosophers were associated with the ruling regime, their debates were fully aired before the public,” Secor says. “Iranian intellectuals, perhaps thrilling to the aura of purpose, often describe the battle as a war by proxy between Heidegger and Popper.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/laura-secors-children-of-paradise-the-struggle-for-the-soul-of-iran.html

It’s the early 1980s, and Jed, a young man from Chicago with an addiction problem, is trying to flee his hometown’s suffocating racism and homophobia by expatriating himself to Berlin, a city he hopes will accept him and his desires as it did Isherwood’s a half-century earlier.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/darryl-pinckneys-black-deutschland.html

Each of these books argues, one way or another, for a continuum between life and its conclusion. The gloss of youthful vitality can persuade us that life is for the living, but life is also for the dying, and repudiating that ultimate punctuation escalates our anxiety and deprives us of final dignity.

2016-02-08,East Meets West in a One-of-a-Kind Cartier Pendant,Art Deco geometry mingles with Indian exoticism in an opal and sapphire necklace from the French jeweler.,"The jeweled panther may be the most recognizable symbol of Cartier, but the historic French house has always nurtured a subtler, more abstract side as well. Louis Cartier, who traveled to India and the Far East in the early 1900s, strove to combine the streamlined geometry of Art Deco with the lush motifs of Asia. Cartier’s chief designer (and Louis’s purported lover) Jeanne Toussaint often expressed that East-meets-West aesthetic in dangling necklaces made with unexpected stones; Cecil Beaton likened them to rosaries. This one-of-a-kind piece evokes those early masterworks. A gold chain adorned with black lacquer chevrons and diamonds cradles an Ethiopian white opal of nearly 16 carats, from which a rare green sapphire leads to the pendant’s decadent drop — a honeycomb of gold and jewels punctuated by a pear-shaped imperial topaz. Not as dangerous as a jungle cat, perhaps, but just as beguiling.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/t-magazine/fashion/opal-sapphire-necklace-cartier.html

When the French fashion designer was young, she would often watch her late mother make a version of tarte au citron that, to her, beat out the versions found in French pâtisseries. Her mother would cover the dough with beans so it wouldn’t curl up, baking it until it was golden and crunchy. Then, she added the filling — a mixture of lemon, egg yolks, sugar and flour — returned the pastry to the oven and let it sit for 15 minutes, topping it with beaten egg whites. She gave it a sprinkling of lemon zest for an extra kick of citrus. “I think it’s much better because they often make it with not enough lemon, and too creamy,” she says. “But this recipe from my mother, it must be an old recipe, but it’s very good. You must use pure lemon with nothing on the skin.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/t-magazine/food/lemon-tart-recipe-agnes-b-maman-bakery.html

Over several decades, we follow the Russian-born narrator ­— an aspiring poet turned American housewife — into the 40 rooms that represent the topography of a privileged, middle-class woman’s life. We are taken from the “stuffy and bright” Moscow apartment bathroom — the first place to “emerge from the haze of nonbeing” when the protagonist is not yet 5 — to the suburban America entrance hall from which she will finally depart. And along the way, we come of age with the person whom we know, tellingly, only as Mrs. Caldwell. Or perhaps I should say, we come of ages with Mrs. Caldwell, because as any woman in her fifth decade or beyond can attest, most of us come of age in many stages: as daughter, as wife, as mother, as . . . you get the idea. It is a mark of the author’s skill that, while sweeping us along in Mrs. Caldwell’s particular narrative, Grushin indirectly challenges the reader to reflect on her own history; to come up with the labels that contribute to her own identity — writer, sister, for example — and to name the rooms in which she has come to her own realizations.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/forty-rooms-by-olga-grushin.html

2016-02-11,Object: Diving Below the Ice,What could the diver be searching for in the frigid depths?,"I grew up in Poland watching my father dive professionally. To me, the most fascinating part of the endeavor was the moment when a diver surfaces. When you dive, descending underwater, you become disoriented. Your adrenaline kicks in. You have the sense that you can go deeper and even deeper still. But before you can do that, you have to know how to stop, and how to keep the pressure safe — only then can you continue. When a diver descends in the water, where there’s only one way out, he is crossing a line, entering a world in which he is entirely reliant on his own resources. So when the diver finally emerges, the relief is almost palpable.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/object-diving-below-the-ice.html

2016-02-12,Inside the List,"Adam Grant’s “Originals,” No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list, overlaps with Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers” in substance as well as style.","Prophets of Doom: Some authors so thoroughly dominate their genre that rivals may want to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Act. Malcolm Gladwell, for instance, is the king of pithily titled, sociologically inflected narrative nonfiction with a vaguely entrepreneurial self-help feel; his “Outliers” has spent 208 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list and is currently No. 7 on the monthly business list. So it seems almost cheeky that the Wharton School professor Adam Grant has settled, for his latest addition to the field, on the pithy title “Originals.” Grant’s book, which debuts at No. 2 on the hardcover nonfiction list — and comes with a front-cover endorsement from Gladwell — overlaps with “Outliers” in substance as well as style: Both propose to explain why some people rise above their peers to change the world. (Gladwell emphasizes practice; Grant, passion and nonconformity.) Readers of the Book Review may be particularly interested in one study Grant cites, in which a psychologist gave subjects an actual New York Times book review, modified to make it either extremely positive or extremely negative, then asked them to rate the critic’s intelligence. “Which version makes the reviewer sound smarter?” Grant asks. “People rated the critical reviewer as 14 percent more intelligent, and having 16 percent greater literary expertise, than the complimentary reviewer. People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it.” Or, as the original researcher put it, “Prophets of doom and gloom appear wise and insightful, while positive statements are seen as having a naïve ‘Pollyanna’ quality.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Nazi Reich is collapsing all around them, and they, like hundreds of thousands, are fleeing the wrathful Soviet advance. They are trapped between their German conquerors and their terrifying Russian “liberators.” Their story is told through the ­voices of Joana, a pretty Lithuanian nurse; Florian, a Prussian with a mysterious letter of passage from a high-ranking Nazi officer; and Emilia, an idealistic but damaged Polish girl in a pink knit cap. Thrown together, struggling to survive, they at first hardly trust one another enough even to exchange names, and so they often just use epithets: “the knight,” “the nurse,” “the Polish girl,” “the wandering boy,” “the shoe poet.” (The last, an old cobbler, gets his name from his philosophy: “The shoes always tell the story.”) Each has secrets — the galling histories that haunt anyone who has lived through war, flight and deprivation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/salt-to-the-sea-by-ruta-sepetys.html

Readers of Faulks’s fiction, most notably of the loose trilogy formed by “Birdsong,” “The Girl at the Lion d’Or” and “Charlotte Gray,” know that his wartime plots tend to involve men and women finding and losing each other.

As with cats, their faces suggest they have no need of us, and in literature they have all the power that goes with independence. There are the foxes in Machiavelli’s “The Prince” (“One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps. . . . ”) and Jean de La Fontaine’s verses, and there’s Disney’s Robin Hood, matinee idol that he was. For me the most memorable literary fox until now has been the baby fox in Ted Hughes’s poem “Epiphany” — a distilled ball of “mannerless energy” and “old smell,” and a test of the poet’s ability to bend his life and marriage to fit the presence of something so wild and destructive, and so beautiful. Pax, the eponymous fox of Sara Pennypacker’s new novel, is built on the model of Hughes’s cub, half wild and half domesticated, a galvanic presence fit to join the ranks of fiction’s great foxes.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/pax-by-sara-pennypacker.html

The leak in the hall splitting the ceiling like the crust of a loaf.” The snowed-in feeling of Lucy Wood’s captivating debut novel, “Weathering,” comes from such descriptions of the house Ada has inherited upon her mother’s death, to which she has brought her young daughter, Pepper. This dampness so pervades the book that it almost swells the pages, and the imagery typifies Wood’s wonderful and energetic style, all the way down to the smallest detail: “She found a silty smudge, like a handprint, on the outside of the kitchen window and a small pile of stones on the front steps.” Lest you settle down too comfortably in this winter cabin of a novel: The handprint is that of her dead mother, Pearl.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/weathering-by-lucy-wood.html

The second one, offered by Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern (who wrote one of the more generous liberal eulogies for Scalia), goes further and argues that Senate Republicans are gambling significantly by declining to approve a moderate-liberal nominee, since if they lose the Senate and the White House this fall they could end up with a more radical, precedent-overturning liberal on the court instead of a compromise choice.

2016-02-16,"‘West of Eden,’ by Jean Stein","In “West of Eden,” Jean Stein continues the project she began in “Edie,” recording our nation’s “trickster promise.”","Oral history looks all too easy. When the Belarussian writer Svetlana Alexievich won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature for her oral histories of humanitarian crises, it seemed an overdue confirmation of the genre’s literary nature — not just its capacity to tell sweeping, timeless human stories, but also the craft and cunning involved in its artful assemblage of specific, individual voices. In this country the form has proved to be both a serious vehicle for popular history and a reliable producer of best sellers, beginning with Studs Terkel’s “Working” in 1974. But it was Jean Stein’s 1982 book “Edie: American Girl,” edited with George Plimpton, that gave oral history the particular shimmer that comes when lofty literary aims happen to coincide with sheer entertainment value. “Edie” conjured the tragic life of Edith Sedgwick, who was born into a patrician New England family, grew up with seven siblings on isolated ­ranches near Santa Barbara under the yoke of a semi-deranged father, came east and after a stint in a mental hospital became Andy Warhol’s arm candy and a figure in New York counterculture, before being cast out by him and dying at 28 of an overdose. In many ways Stein’s new book, “West of Eden,” continues the larger project she began in “Edie”: chronicling a trickster promise embedded in our national consciousness — something shining and elusive and at its center not just ugly but quite often deadly.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/west-of-eden-by-jean-stein.html

The inmate quotes a line memorized from Hurston’s essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me”: “I do not belong to that sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature has somehow given them a lowdown dirty deal.” Delvin lets out a low whistle of disbelief in response. “Well, no wonder I never heard of that woman,” he says, and the inmate posits that, unlike them, Hurston must be “somebody who’s found a way out of the general disrespectfulness.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/ginny-gall-by-charlie-smith.html

How they protect themselves may help the rest of the world save all of the oceans.,"Late on a January 2015 evening in Shepherdstown, W.Va., a data analyst named Bjorn Bergman, surrounded by whiteboards scribbled with computer code, was orchestrating a high-stakes marine police chase halfway around the world. Staring at his laptop in a cramped ground-floor office, he drank from his sixth cup of coffee and typed another in a long series of emails: ‘‘Try and cut them off rather than making for the last known position.’’ Nearly 9,000 miles away, the Remeliik, a police patrol ship from the tiny island nation Palau, was pursuing a 10-man Taiwanese pirate ship, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, through Palauan waters. Bergman, working for a nonprofit research organization called SkyTruth, had mastered the use of satellite data to chart a ship’s most likely course. Instead of pointing the police to where the pirate ship was, he would tell them where it was about to be. He took another sip of coffee, studied his screen, then typed again: ‘‘It may be advisable for the Remeliik to turn southeast.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/palau-vs-the-poachers.html

Gotcher was a labor activist, married to a leader of the Shirtwaist and Laundry Workers’ Union. The court found Muller guilty of violating Oregon law and fined him $10. He refused to pay, and on appeal to the Supreme Court, his lawyer drew national attention by making a feminist argument: Limits on women’s work hours actually discriminate against them. Two years earlier, in the well-known case Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court struck down a state law that restricted bakers, most of them men, to the same 10-hour day. The bakers were ‘‘in no sense wards of the state,’’ the court said. Why, Muller’s lawyer asked, should women be treated differently?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/do-women-need-legislative-protection.html

At 90, she was still sharp and could answer my questions. But she didn’t betray any of the emotion I hoped for. Born in 1890, in a tiny village powered by horses and the sun in a manner hardly changed from the time of ancient Rome, she grew up to witness the invention of the airplane and the adoption of electricity and the telephone. I wanted her to join me in marveling at this series of world-changing transformations, which I knew were beyond anything her girlhood self could have imagined. She just answered my questions calmly, politely. ‘‘No, I don’t remember the first airplane I saw.’’ ‘‘No, I don’t remember the first person I called on a telephone.’’",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/magazine/are-we-doomed-to-slow-growth.html

I have one client whom I like very much and who has requested my services a number of times, but whenever I leave that client’s house, I find myself troubled. This family has a teacup pig, which lives with them in a medium-size apartment. I consider myself an animal lover, and it so happens that I have looked into the fad of teacup pigs. I know that they are really piglets of a larger variety, the potbellied pig, which are unintentionally underfed by owners who have been led by dishonest sellers to believe that the pigs need to eat less than they really do. Right now the pig is small, perhaps 10 to 15 pounds, but I know it will keep growing and that the lowest healthy weight for a full-grown ‘‘teacup pig’’ is about 60 pounds; a potbellied pig can easily grow to more than 100 pounds. I asked the family how big the pig would get, thinking perhaps they knew the facts and had some plan. They told me that they expect it to remain the size it is now. The worst part? They often remark that the pig is acting hungry; I imagine they feed him the too-small amount they were directed to by the seller. I believe that this family loves their pig very much and that I am witnessing an unintentional act of animal cruelty, but I am in a quandary: Should I tell them that they are unwittingly mistreating their beloved pet? I worry that I would be overstepping my professional bounds. People can be very touchy when it comes to their pets, and I want to maintain cordial relations with them for the sake of my continued employment.

2016-02-17,"‘Over-Scheduled Andrew,’ by Ashley Spires",A new picture book about a harried little bird takes aim at the current vogue for jam-packing children’s days with adult-run activities.,"There are some picture books that reach for timelessness, offering no details that give away exactly when the story is taking place, or when it was written. And there are some that speak directly to their moment. “Over-Scheduled Andrew” is (you guessed it) firmly in the latter camp, taking aim at the current vogue for jam-packing children’s days with adult-run activities. This book represents the backlash against the frantic pursuit of what’s often known as “enrichment,” a term that can seem most apropos for the wallets of the adults who teach and coach all these after-school classes, teams and activities. Spires’s message is not subtle: She writes as an unapologetic champion of the idea that, rather than pushing elementary-schoolers into organized, goal-oriented pursuits, we would enrich their lives more by offering them, say, a couple of unstructured hours with a giant cardboard box, some scissors, packing tape and markers, and no grown-ups chirping directions at them.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/books/review/over-scheduled-andrew-by-ashley-spires.html

On a New England plantation, around 1630, a true believer, William (Ralph Ineson), and his family are facing a grim assemblage. The setting is a kind of meeting house crowded with men, women and children, a congregation whose silence and unsmiling faces imply disapproval or perhaps fear. Whether they’re standing in judgment doesn’t matter to William, whose arrogant faith in his own notion of Christianity is as deep and darkly unsettling as his sepulchral voice.

At the time, that curriculum was at the heart of an impassioned culture war over whether the work of “dead white guys” — as some reformers derided them — remained relevant or appropriate for a multicultural generation of American college students.

Trump’s record as a businessman. Far from mastering “The Art of the Deal” — the title of his 1987 best seller — Trump made real estate blunders that turned billions in potential profits into mere millions. His foray into Atlantic City brought him perilously close to personal bankruptcy. As for all his claims about owning a sprawling business empire, what he actually runs these days is a licensing company that slaps the Trump name on everything from buildings to steaks to an education company that was sued by New York State in 2013 for “persistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct.” My conclusion — and I say this as a grizzled veteran of business journalism — was that Trump’s business acumen (not to mention his net worth) was wildly overstated, not least by Trump himself.

The statement by the committee — which said it would continue to look into the matter until early April — also served as the first formal confirmation that the quasi-independent Office of Congressional Ethics had conducted a preliminary review and found reasonable grounds to conclude that Mr. Grayson had violated the rules. Mr. Grayson, who is a candidate for the Senate, set up the hedge fund in 2011, when he was not in Congress, and he has said he cashed out the outside investors in the last year.

A lawyer for the women, Joseph Cammarata, said Mrs. Cosby had been questioned under oath for two and a half hours in a hotel in Springfield, Mass. Her deposition will continue March 14, Mr. Cammarata said. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers had sought to prevent Mrs. Cosby, 71, who was the entertainer’s business manager, from sitting for the deposition on a variety of grounds, and filed an emergency motion Saturday to delay it. But Judge Mark G. Mastroianni of United States District Court ruled Sunday that the deposition should go ahead, although Mrs. Cosby was not compelled to answer questions about her private conversations with her husband. Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby, declined to comment. The civil case is separate from the criminal charges that Mr. Cosby, 78, faces in Pennsylvania, where a woman has accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2004.

Michael Brendan Dougherty has a good column on all the ways that this would be a disaster for the conservative movement — how it would weaken the influence of conservatism’s major institutions (by exposing how “inessential” their ideas and imprimatur are to actually winning power in the G.O.P.), how it would turn the right’s personnel and policy minds against one another (some would throw in with Team Trump, others wouldn’t, and the recriminations would be vicious), and how it would create a particular crisis for the pro-life movement, because Trump’s “conversion on the issue is far less convincing than those of previous nominees like Mitt Romney or George H.W. Bush,” and one way or another his nomination would probably guarantee that genuinely anti-Roe justices would be “reduced to a tiny rump on a consolidated, progressive Supreme Court.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/looking-on-the-bright-side-of-trump/

She was an early voice calling for the government to provide paid maternity leave and offer benefits for part-time workers, but eventually, when she saw no signs of progress, she began considering instead the ways that corporations could reconfigure work to address the realities of the modern employee, who was more likely than ever to be a single parent or part of a dual-income couple. ‘‘We wanted to do a field experiment at a corporation that reduced its hours,’’ she said, ‘‘but realized nobody would let us do that.

The only solution may be a radical one: anonymity.","A few years ago, Kedar Iyer, an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, became acutely aware of a problem in his industry: A surfeit of talented coders were routinely overlooked by employers because they lacked elite pedigrees. Hiring managers, he thought, were too often swayed by the name of a fancy college on a résumé. To try to address the problem, he created a software company called GapJumpers, working with employers to create challenges for applicants that mimicked what people would do on the job. Companies using GapJumpers wouldn’t see candidates’ résumés, just their names, photographs and test results. In theory, this process would shift employers’ focus from résumés to skills. Then, two years ago, he came across an idea that caused him to rethink his business.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/is-blind-hiring-the-best-hiring.html

Japan’s mediation of the conflict was hampered by the fact that Tokio was engaged in important trade negotiations with Indo-China and found it necessary to proceed tactfully. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Feb. 26, 1941",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/1941-final-plan-for-siam-peace/

After opening with one Bach Partita (No. 6), it moves on to early Schumann, pauses on the Impressionist-Symbolist reverie of Szymanowski’s “Metopes,” then reverses its steps through late Schumann and back to Bach (Partita No. 1). “Metopes,” based on three Classical friezes depicting stages of Homer’s “The Odyssey,” are lovely works that are too rarely played and that seem to look both forward and backward. The first is inspired by Odysseus’s encounter with the Sirens. It will be haunting to hear it followed by Schumann’s “Ghost Variations,” the last work he wrote before being confined to a mental institution; according to experts, Schumann tried to drown himself in the Rhine between the composition of the fourth and fifth variations.

Expect something more adventurous from the director Ivo van Hove, who staged the stripped-down revival of Mr. Miller’s “A View from the Bridge.” He has an equally impressive roster to work with, including Saoirse Ronan, Ben Whishaw and Ciaran Hinds.

The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the measure in a 10-to-9 bipartisan vote. Florida’s extremely porous geology raised fears among environmentalists and Florida residents that well stimulation could more easily lead to contamination of underground aquifers, the source of drinking water for almost all Floridians. The bill, which had passed the House, proposed regulating only two forms of well stimulation in the state but left out a third method, matrix acidizing, that is conducted with low pressure. It also would not require oil and gas companies to reveal all of the chemicals they would put into the ground because some are protected by federal law. The legislation called for a study on the potential effect of well stimulation, but matrix acidizing would not be part of the study. Local governments objected to the legislation because it would prohibit them from banning well stimulation. Nearly 80 counties and cities have passed resolutions or ordinances that banned or opposed fracking. The bill can be called up again in the Senate committee. Well stimulation is not regulated in Florida and does not require a separate permit. ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/florida-bill-to-regulate-fracking-fails-to-advance.html

Between Rubio and Ted Cruz, who was also on offense, there was still probably too much talk about how Trump is not a real conservative, and too little in the way of efforts to actually co-opt the valid parts of Trump’s critiques of organized conservatism and the Republican Party. And if Trump somehow wins that will be the deep story — that his rivals just couldn’t grasp how disaffected their voters were from the Bush-and-after record and the present party line. But what we saw last night was at least, and at last, the obvious way of taking down Trump, the way that I’ve assumed will work all along.

But Shatner also devotes generous space to his friend’s sensitive artistic side, taking note of Nimoy’s photographic pursuits and seven volumes of poetry — including, in 1973, the surprisingly successful debut “You & I,” which went through five print runs in hardcover and had an initial paperback printing of 250,000 copies. “What helped sell the book, of course, was the fact that Leonard was willing to promote it by doing bookstore signings,” Shatner writes. “It may have been Leonard’s poetry — but fans were getting Spock’s autograph.” What did Shatner think of the work? “Trying to understand poets through their poetry requires higher degrees than I have,” he writes, “but it is obvious reading his work that from the beginning to the end Leonard was intent on emotionally defining grand themes like love, compassion, loss and the endless search for roots. For the man who became famous playing the ultimate dispassionate character, his poems successfully bring out the range of important emotions.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2016-02-26,"‘Strange Gods,’ by Susan Jacoby",Susan Jacoby examines the motives for religious conversion.,"By the time she was 14, the writer Susan Jacoby realized that there is no God, and ever after, she has been working to share that insight. Her new book studies the phenomenon of conversion, since she is upset that people still find ways to accept “goofy religious myths.” Sometimes she writes as if it is a personal insult to her for people to have any religion. She resents the fact that a nun of the Dominican order, singing a tribute to the order’s founder, St. Dominic, did so with a “mind-numbing refrain that still pounds in my cortex as ‘Dominiqua-niqua-niqua.’ ” She writes to prove that the so-called religious experience of conversion often has a secular explanation — then she offers a broad range to choose from.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/books/review/strange-gods-by-susan-jacoby.html

The caesura, or poetic line break, becomes a literal break, geologic in form, rising from the piece like a mountain range from a fault line. “It’s linguistic,” says Larner, who this week presents nearly 30 of these wall-hung sculptures as a body of work at the Aspen Art Museum, “but it’s also physical.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/t-magazine/art/liz-larner-sculpture-aspen-art-museum.html
