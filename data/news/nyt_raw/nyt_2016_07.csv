2016-07-01,Inside the List,"Nancy Isenberg, whose “White Trash” is No. 8 on the hardcover nonfiction list, says “Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists.”","Class Mates: When Nancy Isenberg began her latest work of American history, “White Trash” — a comprehensive survey of the white underclass going back to colonial times — she had no idea that thanks largely to the very group she was writing about, Donald Trump would become the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Now that he has, and her suddenly topical book has entered the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8, I asked Isenberg (a history professor at Louisiana State University) what she made of the presidential race so far. “Electoral politics has always encouraged con artists,” she said via email. “By talking tough, by boasting that he’d love to throw a punch at a protester, Trump pretends he is stepping down from his opulent Manhattan penthouse to commingle with the unwashed masses. Wearing his bright red Bubba cap and crooning at one rally, ‘I love the poorly educated,’ he has built upon a familiar strain of American populism. Which is to say, a dose of redneck bluster goes a long way.” (The same dynamic, she noted, came to the Democrats’ aid in 1992: “It helped that Bill Clinton called himself Bubba and played the saxophone. It helped, too, that journalists dubbed him the Arkansas Elvis.”) I asked why underprivileged whites so often vote differently from poor people of other races — shouldn’t economic considerations be more or less colorblind? — and Isenberg reached back to history for her answer. “Southern white Democrats fueled racial conflict between poor blacks and whites in order to redirect the anger of the lower classes away from the white elite,” she said. “In 1790, John Adams argued that Americans not only scrambled to get ahead; they needed someone to disparage. . . . Lyndon Johnson came to the same conclusion, in explaining the racism of poor whites: ‘If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket.’ ” Then she returned to the current election cycle. “Trump’s supporters want class security, not revolution,” she said. “They want more blue-collar white male jobs, not equality, not social justice. They want to turn the clock backward in order to regain the white male pride that comes from being the family breadwinner. Trump’s slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ is a nostalgic appeal to the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s, when America was an industrial power and working-class jobs were plentiful. Until we understand our class system, warts and all, we will be saddled with an anemic democratic system that only makes our class and race resentments worse.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/books/review/inside-the-list.html

On the right bank, toward ten o’clock in the morning, our infantry carried out an assault of the Thiaumont work, which was recaptured.

2016-07-03,1966: France Conducts Nuclear Test in Pacific,"From the archives of The International New York Times: In July 1966, France tested an atomic bomb in the Pacific.","PAPEETE, TAHITI — France yesterday [July 3] exploded an atomic bomb over a South Pacific atoll and was promptly condemned by the United States and Britain for ignoring the 1963 Moscow treaty banning atmospheric nuclear tests. The blast was the first of a series of nuclear explosions planned to test the trigger of France’s future hydrogen bombs. The bomb — a plutonium device — was exploded from a tower on the atoll of Mururoa, 800 miles southeast of Tahiti. The U.S. and British criticism of the blast was brushed aside by French officials as ‘‘irritatingly moralizing.’’ France refused to sign the 1963 treaty, claiming it was designed to persuade a U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly. Today most major countries joined in publicly condemning the French blast. But the Soviet Union and Communist China reported it without comment. French officials here and in Paris did not reveal the size of the explosion. A Defense Ministry communiqué from Paris said only that its power was in ‘‘the tactical range.’’ The blast was weak enough to allow French officials to stroll in the explosion area ten hours later wearing street clothes. The United States said it ‘‘regretted’’ that France has resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere at a time when most world nations have signed the limited test ban treaty. Japan, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and India were among other countries deploring the blast. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 4, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/1966-france-conducts-nuclear-test-in-pacific/

The number of villages now wrested from the invader has reached seventeen, and more than 12,300 prisoners are reported up to the present. The Germans have intensified and multiplied their counter-attacks, but, apart from slight successes at one or two points, have only added to the hecatombs of their dead on the battlefields of the Somme. The French troops, by a lightning advance, have now conquered along a front of seven and a half kilomètres the two lines of trenches forming the German second line between the Méreaucourt wood and the outskirts of Estrées, carrying by assault during the process the villages of Herbécourt, Feuillères and Assevillers and the Chapitre wood. During the afternoon they continued their advantage and, progressing beyond the enemy’s second line, took the villages of Buscourt and Flaucourt, an advance of five kilomètres in that region. The British troops fighting between the Somme and the Ancre have had to meet many powerful German counter-attacks, but despite the enemy’s desperate resistance the strongly-fortified village of La Boisselle has been captured, and the Germans are now fighting fiercely to retain the doomed village of Ovillers. Appalling losses have been inflicted on the enemy during his counter-attacks, and the British total of prisoners has reached 4,300. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 4, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/1916-allies-take-six-more-villages-in-somme-offensive/

This approach has given the show space to work, but it has also cost the series crucial momentum. “Infiltration” is the busiest and most surreal episode of this season so far, but it also sets up some promising disasters.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/arts/television/unreal-season-2-episode-5-recap.html

For Schiaparelli’s Fall 2016 couture collection this week, the creative director Bertrand Guyon opted to take a less literal approach to the founder’s theme. With the above image, we take a closer look at the making of the “La Roue du Rhin” dress: a dazzling, iridescent gown complete with a Ferris wheel, celestial themes — and, on the back, a soaring phoenix, all meticulously hand-sewn with beads.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/t-magazine/fashion/haute-couture-schiaparelli-dress.html

It was a blend of organic milk, cream, sugar and egg yolks to make ice cream at home, something like the mixtures that many ice cream shops use, but not something home cooks can usually buy. Churn it with the flavors of your choice for 14 percent butterfat French (custard-based) ice cream. Another simple, uncommon and subtly tasty item was birch water, consisting of undiluted, unsweetened, earthy birch sap from Ukraine. Other observations I took away: coconut in every possible permutation; maple on the rise, challenging honey; and new dessert hummus in flavors including chocolate and snickerdoodle, like eating frosting by the spoonful: Naia Home Cranked ice cream mix, $13.99 for 2 quarts, homecranked.com; Säpp Birch Water, $3.49 for 10 ounces at Whole Foods, sapplife.co.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/fancy-food-show-ice-cream-birch-tree-water.html

2016-07-05,Times Square Wakes Up to a Restaurant From Kellogg’s,"Christina Tosi serves up cereal bowls, Bergen Hill moves to Manhattan, and other restaurant news.","Kellogg’s NYC Breakfast all day, a popular offering these days, usually means egg and sausage, but the cereal behemoth will have none of that. Its new restaurant in Times Square takes cold cereal in inventive directions, thanks to Christina Tosi, the pastry chef behind the Milk Bar chain, who started serving cereal milk eight years ago. She has devised various combinations, six with a choice of milk (from a local dairy), soy milk or yogurt, and four with Blue Marble soft-serve ice cream. Extra ingredients include matcha, fresh peaches, lemon zest, passion-fruit jam made in Brooklyn, pistachios and white chocolate. Ten cereals are available, from basic Rice Krispies to rugged All-Bran to baroque Froot Loops. Despite the newfangled flavors, the restaurant also mines nostalgia with white brick walls, some vintage artifacts and little numbered cupboards that you open when your order is ready, almost like the Automat. It is owned by Anthony Rudolf, formerly of Per Se, whom Kellogg’s tapped for the partnership. The company wanted the restaurant to be run like and feel like a small business, and, as Andy Shripka, Kellogg’s associate marketing director, said, “we didn’t know how to do that.” Originally it hoped to open in the Flatiron district or the East Village, but the Midtown space became available. It made the company a bit nervous. “How can we be the opposite of what people expect here in Times Square?” Mr. Shripka said.

The film, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, revisits those highs and lows through the memories of both players, and of some who witnessed their careers, including Jon Stewart and the Mets announcer Howie Rose. “I really thought, ‘My God, we are possibly looking at the closest thing to perfection that we’ve ever seen on a pitcher’s mound,’” Mr. Rose recalls of the early Gooden years.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/arts/television/in-doc-darryl-two-mets-recall-how-it-played-out.html

Avoid catching in the center.,"“Take off any jewelry or watches,” says Tony Gemignani, an eight-time winner of the world championship in pizza-­dough acrobatics and owner of 16 pizzerias in California and Las Vegas. To avoid snags, your hands should be unadorned, with fingernails cut short. Roll or stretch a softball-­size ball of dough (11 to 14 ounces) into a 10-­inch circle. Drape it over your hands, and bring them up to your chest like a boxer. Your dominant hand should be palm up, the other in an upward-­facing fist. If you’re right handed, you’ll be rotating the dough in a clockwise spin (counterclockwise for lefties). To wind up for the toss, wheel your palm in the opposite direction of your eventual throw. Unwind, simultaneously pushing up and rotating your palm until the back of your wrist faces you. Release the dough just above your head, and catch it again at your upper chest atop the knuckles of both fists. Repeat. Try not to catch the dough right in the center, which can weaken the middle, resulting in what Gemignani calls “droopy” pizza slices. Always practice over a clean countertop so you can salvage fumbled catches.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/how-to-toss-a-pizza.html

The text, which is brief, but of considerable importance, proves the firm determination of the two Powers to maintain relations of mutual confidence and to co-ordinate their efforts for the defence of their rights and legitimate interests. It does not in any way threaten the situation of any other Power having equally-pacific designs, and it is in complete harmony with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, of which it augments the force and is a corollary. Frequent allusions from an unauthorized source have intimated that the document will have an important influence on the future attitude of Japan toward China. — The New York Herald, European Edition, July 9, 1916",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/1916-russia-and-japan-sign-pact/

Birnbaum spent four and a half years driving around to collect them, hauling them back one or two at a time. He was only interested in the relatively hard to find variety with faux-wood-paneled doors — when stacked in towers up to 10 feet high, the wood grain mimics a tree. Entering “Voyeur Voyager Forager Forester,” Birnbaum’s installation of 16 of these totems at Denny Gallery on the Lower East Side is intended to feel, then, a bit like walking into a dense, humming forest. And like all forests, this one is full of surprises: Using paint and other artistic tools, Birnbaum created a lively interior for each of the fridges, filling them with everyday items from earrings to toilet-paper rolls. All you have to do is open the door. (Birnbaum shared some detail shots of these little worlds with T in the slide show below; you can also experience “opening” the fridges by sliding your cursor over the image above.)",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/t-magazine/art/brent-birnbaum-fridge-art.html

2016-07-15,Inside the List,"“Seinfeldia,” No. 13 on the hardcover nonfiction list, goes behind the scenes of the groundbreaking sitcom about nothing.","Must See: It’s been almost 20 years since the “Seinfeld” series finale left Jerry and his friends in orange prison jumpsuits — ­convicted, fittingly enough, of doing nothing — and changes to the industry since then have pretty much ensured that even as television gets smarter and more daring, no subsequent show will have the reach and mass cultural impact of “Seinfeld” at its height. (Consider: More than 76 million viewers tuned in for the “Seinfeld” finale, while the much anticipated “Mad Men” finale drew approximately 4.6 million.) Now the show and its influence are the subject of a new book, “­Seinfeldia,” by the entertainment writer Jennifer Kei­shin Armstrong, which lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13. “They elevated the art of the sitcom,” Armstrong told NBC News recently. “They did things with it that they were told they couldn’t do.” What’s more, she said, for a show that was supposedly about nothing, “Seinfeld” managed to take on many of the social preoccupations of its time. That makes it tempting to imagine what the series would be like today had it continued. “It sounds weird,” Armstrong said, “but I would have loved to see them addressing things like 9/11 or terrorism. . . . When something is far enough away, you can start to attack it.” She added: “I’d be interested to see how they would address even more benign things like internet trolling, that sort of thing. Could they possibly pull off an episode about transgender issues? I would be interested.” Actually, the trans thing isn’t so hard to picture — remember when Kramer came up with the Bro, his bra for men?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Sherris chose to focus on female swimmers in part because she’d always been fascinated by water (the element served as a springboard for her Parsons thesis collection) and in part because she’d always found swimmers’ bodies to be quite beautiful. “I always thought female swimmers didn’t get enough attention in terms of the way they look,” she says. “The bodies of male swimmers are idolized; women who play sports, their bodies are often considered distorted.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/t-magazine/fashion/babes-in-bathers-swimsuits-maayan-sherris.html

2016-07-20,Letter of Recommendation: Just Dance,Video game as sweaty regression.,"I never really intended for it to become my workout routine. I first started playing “Just Dance” two years ago, when someone gave my 8-year-old twin sons an Xbox. Most of the system’s games would have them cultivating lethal marksmanship, while even the less-bloody titles seemed destined to foul up their reward system with excessive showers of virtual gold coins. “Just Dance,” by contrast, had a wholesome appeal. My children could listen to pop music while mirroring an avatar’s dance moves, as a motion detector judged their accuracy. And we could do it as a family, the modern-day version of gathering around the piano to sing.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-just-dance.html
2016-07-20,Three New Books About the White House,"Ken Burns’s first children’s book, and more presidential lore.","A cheerful mix of gardening, history and patriotism, “Diana’s White House Garden” — about a little girl whose father was a presidential adviser — seems fictional, or at least apocryphal, but it’s true, if airbrushed. Diana Hopkins was the daughter of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s chief aide, Harry Hopkins. Her mother had died of cancer — though the book, which is presented as “based on Diana Hopkins’ childhood memories,” oddly leaves out mention of her mother. In 1943, when the story begins, Diana seems largely left to her own devices. We see her wandering unsupervised in and out of White House rooms making innocent mischief as her father and the rest of the grown-ups are busy dealing with the war.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/books/review/ken-burns-grover-cleveland-again-and-more.html

We can now see — witness his recurrent appearances in Alex Ross’s superb history “The Rest Is Noise” (2007) — that no study of 20th-century music is complete without Cage.

Previous studies showed that people living in cities risked experiencing anxiety and mood disorders at a much higher rate than noncity dwellers — from 29 percent to 39 percent more.The German study, published five years ago, tried to find out more specifically, or rather how, physiologically, this was so. To that end, researchers examined the brains of 50 people, some of whom lived in big cities, some in the country, while they were engaged in challenging mathematical exercises. Among city dwellers, the study found, the amygdala, a set of neurons lodged deep in the brain’s medial temporal lobe, went into overdrive during the experiment, meaning that urbanites are hypersusceptible to stress, presumably because they experience so much of it.

It’s the kind of after-hours vigilante work that’s gotten Maureen in trouble in the past. But “she was tougher now. Meaner. And she hoped she was smarter.” Well, maybe. But physical violence has become her raison d’être; in fact, the only time she feels safe is “when she was running and when she was chasing.

A despatch from Geneva says that it is learned from Berlin that Herr von Batocki, the German food dictator, has resigned and that he was immediately replaced by Herr von Berg. A subsequent message from Amsterdam states, however, that he has merely resigned his position as High President of Eastern Prussia and that he still retains office as food dictator.

Take Daniel Silva, whose novel “The Black Widow” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 1. You and I might be duly terrorized by terrorism, but Silva — whose series hero is the art restorer and Israeli spy Gabriel Allon — is tantalized. So “The Black Widow” opens with ISIS bombings in Paris and Amsterdam that inevitably call to mind actual attacks carried out since last fall in France and northern Europe. Yet any similarities, Silva notes in a foreword, are coincidental. “I commenced work on this novel before the Islamic terrorist group known as ISIS carried out a wave of shootings and bombings in Paris and Brussels that left more than 160 people dead,” he writes. “After briefly considering setting aside the typescript, I chose to complete it as originally conceived. . . .

The speech was being staged at the F.D.R. memorial on New York City’s Roosevelt Island, and though Wong is a political operative of atypical modesty — she describes herself as a former schoolteacher whose accession to minor power has been entirely accidental — she had taken the choice of venue as auspicious. Wong runs the Roosevelt Institute, a small think tank (for lack of a better term) that originated in trusts established to promote the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor. Its chief economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, indirectly coined the Occupy movement’s enduring slogan (“We are the 99 percent”), and Stiglitz and Wong each saw the election as an opportunity to channel Occupy energy into national politics. The country was perhaps ready once again, they believed, for what F.D.R. called “bold, persistent experimentation” in our economic affairs. Two of Wong’s senior staff members had gone to the island for the event, but she herself bowed out, claiming the duties of a part-time suburban soccer coach and mom.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/magazine/could-hillary-clinton-become-the-champion-of-the-99-percent.html

(My favorite thing about that book, which centers on an amnesiac and a bachelorette party gone very wrong, was learning that the British call such gatherings “hen parties.” One London reviewer described the story as “the hen party from hell,” which makes you think things might end in nuggets and dipping sauce.) Both of Ware’s novels resemble classic locked-door mysteries: Her first takes place in a remote English country house and her latest on a cruise ship in the North Sea — a horrifying enough prospect for some of us even before the protagonist witnesses a murder and is accused of losing her mind. Unsurprisingly, Ware said last year that she was a big fan of the golden-age mystery writers. “I love classic crime,” she told NPR’s David Greene during her “Dark Wood” publicity tour. “I read a huge amount of it as a kid, you know, Agatha Christie, Josephine Tey, Dorothy L. Sayers, Sherlock Holmes. And I didn’t consciously channel that when I was writing. But when I finished and reread the book, I did suddenly realize how much this kind of structure owed to, particularly, Agatha Christie. It wasn’t consciously done, but I think the setting, you know, the way it’s a closed cast of characters — I would say I definitely owe a debt to Christie.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Harden has trained thousands of rats for movies like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” and television shows like “True Blood.” He and his colleagues schooled 600 rats for the 2003 horror movie “Willard.” “I can watch that movie now,” he says, “and pick out the 12 or 13 rats that really captured our hearts.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/magazine/how-to-train-a-rat.html

And summer still has a few months to go. Arctic sea ice typically shrinks until mid-September, when darker nights and colder temperatures come, and the ice cover begins to expand again. We don’t yet know if the approaching yearly minimum this September will be the historical low, but it seems on track to possibly match, or even exceed, the previous record minimum, which occurred in 2012.
