Before you go launching wildflower seed projectiles, start with a solid recipe. You’ll need a mixing bowl and baking sheets. Add one part native wildflower seed mix — Cunningham’s include bluebonnets, blanket flowers and native grasses, but yours should reflect what grows endemic to your region — to four parts powdered clay and five parts fine-grained compost. Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly and stir in water slowly until you have a thick, bread-dough-like consistency.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/magazine/how-to-make-a-wildflower-bomb.html

A live orchestra struck up a blaring John Williams-style score as the curtain lifted to reveal a sloping stage, at the very top of which stood Kojima, a slight Japanese man with swooping black hair and glasses. The floor began to light up underneath him, panes of light flying in from left and right to create a sort of light bridge, which he bounded down to shake a Sony executive’s hand.

The architect David Rockwell’s company, the Rockwell Group, has given the space a richly elegant but subdued look with shades of gray as the dominant palette. The Peak experience involves entering through a dim, plush lounge for cocktails and bar snacks on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards’s retail building. From there, an elevator speeds up and docks at a spacious lobby, with the restaurant to one side and private dining rooms and an event space opposite. The restaurant dips gradually from a curved, brass-trimmed 45-seat bar area to a 110-seat dining room, where sculptural light sticks hang from the ceiling and bare tables on a few levels afford views like a bird’s-eye of the Empire State Building. Does it remind you of Windows on the World? Of course, but with less grandeur and gilt. The restaurant is run by RHC, the English company that also manages Wild Ink in Hudson Yards. The executive chef, Christopher Cryer, who was in that role at the Seamore’s seafood restaurants, has created a fairly brief menu of sophisticated yet accessible American fare like Atlantic scallops with cauliflower purée, beef tartare, rigatoni with lamb sausages, roasted monkfish with littleneck clams, cauliflower steak, braised short rib, rotisserie chicken and a fried potato terrine.

I had woken, as I sometimes do, in a fit of desire that was usually reciprocated, as if Misha and I were wired to the same internal alarm: we woke up as one. This was often how we began to make love. We reached for each other through the film of separate dreams and then fell back in states of mutual surprise, nonverbally reaffirmed. That night, however, he slept. The thin light spilled through the air shaft and onto our bed, and in it he looked strange. Not less attractive—if anything, more so—but also not quite like the man I’d married not so long ago. His chin was slack. His brow furrowed with some small concern. I rubbed my eyes. Misha was older than I was by only a few months, but in that moment it seemed a whole decade had intervened. I reached out to touch his cheek across a stretch of time. He didn’t stir.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/books/review/the-exhibition-of-persephone-q-by-jessi-jezewska-stevens-an-excerpt.html

There’s Kim Ghattas’s political study “Black Wave,” about the regional power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And there are books about the consequences of demonizing the other: Philippe Lançon’s “Disturbance” is a memoir of his recovery after surviving the terrorist attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, and Kiran Millwood Hargrave’s historical novel “The Mercies” revisits the real-life Vardo witch trials of 17th-century Norway, while Candacy Taylor (“Overground Railroad”) and Gretchen Sorin (“Driving While Black”) both look at the harrowing steps black travelers had to take to navigate, literally, the roads of Jim Crow America.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

His collection has grown to include over 300 pieces, which he houses in a Haussmannian-style apartment beside the Seine, where he moved to in 2009. Takada sources many of his items from Japan and Hong Kong (he travels to Asia six times a year) and his favorite Paris antique shops.

Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/dining/vegan-meat-corned-beef.html

Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/t-magazine/zenith-el-primero-watch.html

So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

And the Dixie Chicks perform on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”,"CHARLIE SAYS (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Mary Harron vacillates between prison and movie ranch in “Charlie Says,” her drama about the Charles Manson cult. Though she is best known as the director of the satirical serial-killer study “American Psycho,” Harron here pays relatively little attention to Manson himself (played by Matt Smith), instead focusing on three of his female followers (played by Hannah Murray, Marianne Rendón and Sosie Bacon). That trio tells the story here. The movie shows them both during their time with Manson and after the fact, in prison, where they recount their story to a graduate student (Karlene Faith, played by Merritt Wever). “It’s a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turner’s script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron — she has something to say.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-charlie-says-and-the-dixie-chicks.html

One possibility: something from this list of epidemic-themed novels we’ve compiled. But if that’s a little too close to the bone, we bring you a wider array of choices below, from the conclusion of Hilary Mantel’s wonderful Wolf Hall trilogy, about the life of Thomas Cromwell, to a journalist’s account of his efforts to shine light on long-unsolved race crimes, to Brian Greene’s cosmological contemplations in “Until the End of Time.” (Talk about close to the bone.)

2020-03-16,An Exquisite Necklace That Recalls an Art-Deco Pioneer,Cartier’s new Mauna necklace channels the combination of restraint and radiant excess brought to the house by the jewelry designer Jeanne Toussaint.,"When the designer Jeanne Toussaint, known for both her lithe, turbaned elegance and her lasting friendship with Coco Chanel, was named by Louis Cartier as head of jewelry design at his family-run company in 1933, her restrained yet vibrant pieces came to define a new era of Art Deco abstraction. While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems. Among them was the rare pinkish-orange imperial topaz, mined in the 19th century in western Russia’s Ural Mountains, when only the czar’s family were allowed to wear the stones. This new necklace features three exquisite imperial topazes from Brazil, including a dangling 11-carat pear-cut bicolor stone with an ombré effect that shifts from fuchsia to Tuscan yellow. Set off by diamonds, colored sapphires and rutilated quartz prized for its slash-like inclusions, it evokes Toussaint’s combustible combination of classical discipline and modern exuberance.

As the friends plan to reunite during winter break, one, Spencer, delves back into the Jumanji video game, and the rest of the group has no choice but to follow him. But the game malfunctions, leaving Bethany, another of the friends, in the real world and dragging in Spencer’s grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his old friend (Danny Glover). What’s more, the youngsters don’t have the same avatars as before — which makes for some amusing and not-so-amusing performances. (Hart channeling Glover? Sure. Johnson playing DeVito? Not quite.) Critics said the movie doesn’t live up to “Welcome to the Jungle,” but carries enough laughs and tantalizing action scenes to keep you in the game.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-jumanji-the-next-level-and-inside-no-9.html

Yes, Adolf Hitler was ridiculous and vulgar, a tin-pot demagogue instead of a smooth politician, but he knew how to excite the nationalist base and deliver a whopper of a speech.

College-educated adults usually read between 200 and 400 words per minute (a comfortable listening rate is around 150 words per minute). The speediest speed readers claim as many as 30,000 words per minute, at which point research would suggest a significant loss of comprehension. It might be fine to skim through a user manual for an office printer, but don’t skim “Anna Karenina” and expect to understand it. “In this modern age, we always want to do everything faster,” says Schotter, whose lab uses high-speed video to analyze readers’ eyes as they dart across text. America’s speed-reading obsession confounds Schotter; on average, people read twice as fast as they can comfortably listen. Reading is visually and cognitively complicated; it’s OK to reread a line because it’s confusing or, better yet, to linger on a phrase so beautiful that it makes you want to close your eyes.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/magazine/speed-reading.html

The Great Depression brought “The Grapes of Wrath.” The Spanish Inquisition helped inspire “Don Quixote.” Cholera gave Camus “The Plague” (so to speak).

Upon graduating in 2009, he moved to Manhattan for good and launched his namesake collection from his studio apartment, where he slept on an air mattress.

And the comedian Mae Martin stars in a new series on Netflix.,"BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE (2020) Stream on Hulu. Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson’s character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend’s 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo’s pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). “Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics,” Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo,” Kim added, “‘Big Time Adolescence’ doesn’t have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-big-time-adolescence-and-feel-good.html

There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the city’s black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. “It’s hard not to root for them even if they’re obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film, Dargis wrote, “uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-the-banker-and-blow-the-man-down.html

His interest in Memphis — a design collective formed in 1981 that placed an emphasis on bold colors and wild abstraction — stems in part from a fascination with the boundary-pushing aesthetics of that decade. In particular, Kirkwood is drawn to the graphic glass vases made by Ettore Sottsass, the Italian industrial designer and father of the postmodernist movement. “I found my first Sottsass vase about six years ago in Paris,” he says. “I was struck by its shape and color — it resembled something a child might build.” Since then, the 39-year-old has amassed a collection of over a dozen vases. Several are assembled on a windowsill in his Soho studio to catch the light, and a few contain the sculptural flower arrangements he prefers from London’s Fjura. “Sottsass pieces may not be practical or classically beautiful, but they can really hold a room,” says the designer, whose spring collection is inspired by the relationship between architecture and nature in Los Angeles.

Today, the tubs might be more technologically advanced but the practice remains deeply soothing. “Sitting in water is the ideal environment for calming the mind and body,” says the New York-based facialist Nachi Kanemaru Glick, who grew up taking a nightly bath at her childhood home in Miyazaki, Japan. “The water helps ingredients penetrate the skin, the heat releases tension and it’s a quiet time for meditation and self-reflection.” Or as Deborah Hanekamp, a New York-based wellness expert and author of the book “Ritual Baths” (out March 24) puts it, “We all feel one way before we get in the bath, and then a bit better when we get out.” The right mix of products and atmosphere can easily elevate the average soak, says the British facialist Alexandra Soveral, who has a background in chemistry.

In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film “unfolds from a perspective of lived experience.” Newnham and LeBrecht, he added, “deftly juggle a large cast of characters past and present, accomplishing the not-so-easy task of making all the personalities distinct.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-crip-camp-and-dark-phoenix.html

2020-03-26,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘1917’ and ‘Unorthodox’,Sam Mendes’s World War I drama is available for digital rental. And a series based on a memoir by Deborah Feldman debuts on Netflix.,"1917 (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. “1917” may not be the most obvious candidate for at-home viewing, given the emphasis it puts on technical wizardry, but those who missed this ambitious World War I drama from Sam Mendes when it was on the big screen can now rent it from many online platforms. Set in April of the year it’s named for, “1917” stars Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay as a pair of British soldiers sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message to troops on the front line. Their journey, shot by Roger Deakins (who won an Oscar for his cinematography), is made to look as if it were filmed in a single long take. “The round-faced Chapman brings loose, affable charm to his role, while MacKay, a talented actor who’s all sharp angles, primarily delivers reactive intensity,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “This lack of nuance can be blamed on Mendes, who throughout seems far more interested in the movie’s machinery than in the human costs of war or the attendant subjects — sacrifice, patriotism and so on — that puff into view like little wisps of engine steam.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-1917-and-unorthodox.html

He said hello warmly before resuming his position in front of a large window, which looked onto a boulevard that cut through town and then vanished into green fields.

On one wall hung a painting that bore the owner’s name, which somewhat stereotypically depicted four African masks suspended in a cloud of hieroglyphs; across from it stood a display case containing regional glassware and a number of vintage die-cast cars. Louis was in the midst of a preliminary shoot for a documentary with the working title “Édouard Louis, or the Transformation,” and the filmmaker, François Caillat, had rented the apartment for its views. “Now you have Amiens at your feet,” Caillat said. “When you arrived, it wasn’t like that.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/magazine/edouard-louis-french-literature.html
