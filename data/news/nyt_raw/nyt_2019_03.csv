2019-03-01,See How Margaret Atwood and Jonathan Lethem and More Draw a Bunny,The writer Sabra Embury has spent a decade collecting 10-second drawings of rabbits from some of the most esteemed names in literature.,"I started this 10-second rabbit project a little over a decade ago as a way of channeling the artistic curiosity of the inspiring people around me. At parties I’d collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then we’d guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they’re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They’re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn’t asking for serious art. Still, they’d often protest, “I can’t draw!” before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: “This is great!” she said, adding a carrot. Others (I’ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a “here goes” as I counted to 10.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/books/sabra-embury.html

In that film, Samara, a demonic orphan drowned in a well by her tormented adoptive mother, rose from the dead, via VHS tape, to terrorize the living. The particulars of the story are less important than the version that has lodged itself in our imaginations: the tape itself, a choppy cut of generically alarming images; the ringing phone, and the voice on the other end of the line whispering seven days; the inhuman form crawling out of the television; the waterlogged face peeking out from behind the wall of stringy black hair. “The Ring” was both horrifying and meaningfully divergent from its source material, a Japanese book and film series. The third installment of the American series, “Rings” (2017), was a minor commercial success and a massive critical flop. For now, the franchise appears to be on pause.

Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves “scraping” the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so “can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes — and provide a calming effect,” says Dr. Wexler. Without an on-off switch or any visual cues, though, these implements require a bit of practice.

The film is making its American debut on Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it’s got an episodic vividness and blanket-load of warmth, but also a harsh view of day-to-day life for black people in South London — on its streets, in its public housing, at its video arcades. If the police aren’t trying to shake down and beat up these guys, some fed-up white lady has come to their chill spot to complain (not unreasonably) that their music is too loud by telling them (unreasonably) to go back to their country and calling them “jungle bunnies.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/movies/babylon-review.html

They make their daters go bikini skiing, or mud wrestle their romantic rivals, or kiss in old-age makeup.

Their representation is small and growing only marginally — in 2007, women in uniform made up 14.4 percent of the force — and their stories tend to be ignored in favor of legacies left by men who have shaped the narrative of service to country. Despite being overlooked, servicewomen are forging new career paths for themselves and the next generation as they enter jobs that were once closed to them. Consider pioneers like Capt. Rosemary Mariner, who was one of the first female Navy pilots in the 1970s and the first woman to lead a naval aviation squadron. She died in January from ovarian cancer, and her memory was honored last month with a flyover using all-female pilots. Or First Lt. Marina A.

She had been the first woman to join the I.R.A. as a front-line soldier — leading bombing raids, targeting people for execution. She was a very dramatic, impetuous figure.” Keefe says he “was so intrigued by some of the details in the obituary that I wanted to see where they went.” Where they went, it turns out, is straight to the notorious 1972 kidnapping and murder of Jean McConville, a widowed Belfast mother of 10.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/books/review/patrick-radden-keefe-say-nothing.html

But James Kent, who was a chef de cuisine at Eleven Madison Park and the executive chef at the NoMad, and Jeff Katz, the former manager of Del Posto, said it referred to a phenomenon in the forest in which the tops of trees do not meet. “It’s like the buildings down here,” said Mr. Kent, referring to the financial district. “They’re tall and narrow, but do not meet.” The restaurant’s address, on Pine Street, reinforces the theme. It’s on the ground floor of an Art Deco tower that was the headquarters of the insurance giant AIG, in a space that was at one time to house a restaurant from Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield. Now the building’s co-owners and managers, Rose Associates, have brought in this new team. The restaurant, an airy space with high ceilings in ivory and butterscotch, has two dining areas, with the kitchen, an immense stainless-steel island, to one side. Mr. Kent’s menu is eclectic and creative. Dishes include cauliflower Parmigiano, grilled pears with feta and pistachio pesto, roasted sunchokes with Cheddar and hazelnuts, and glazed farro with bone marrow (farro marrow?) and oxtail. Larger plates for sharing include roasted short ribs, grilled chicken with hot sauce, and butterflied branzino.

2019-03-20,"The Pioneers of Postmodern Dance, 60 Years Later","The movement upended all notions of what the form could be. Today, it’s still shaping how we see the world around us.","ON A MID-DECEMBER morning at her home studio, which is perched on a wooded hill near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., the 98-year-old dance artist Anna Halprin was leading a movement class. “Think about positive and negative space,” she said, observing from a director’s chair as her 12 students — a retired preschool teacher, a fine-linens importer — assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not. One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin’s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952.

2019-03-20,Why Tim O’Brien Agreed to Write for ‘This Is Us’,The acclaimed author of “The Things They Carried” talked to The Times about writing for Season 3 and how an all-volunteer military force changed the public’s perception of war.,"When the creators of “This Is Us” decided they wanted the third season to explore one of its key characters’ experiences in the Vietnam War, they knew they had to bring in some support. “We were determined to get it right,” according to Dan Fogelman, the show’s executive producer. The choice of whom to tap was not hard. In June 2018, NBC announced that Fogelman’s “literary hero,” Tim O’Brien, would join the show as a consultant. He ultimately took on a bigger role and joined the writing staff, according to Fogelman. O’Brien’s books about the Vietnam War have sold more than six million copies, won numerous awards and repeatedly been recognized as some of the most important works of American fiction of the 20th century. “The Things They Carried,” probably O’Brien’s most famous work, which he didn’t publish until 1990, conveyed his intimate experiences as an American draftee through haunting short stories that explore the physical and emotional baggage that the soldiers of Alpha Company carried with them in Vietnam. In many ways, his episodic, character-driven storytelling style was a natural fit for “This Is Us.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/magazine/tim-obrien-this-is-us-vietnam.html

Jonathan Gardner’s impressive second New York solo show is one of numerous cases in point. The stylish, stylized paintings in “Desert Wind” are wry, lush and pleasurable in their beauty and their brains. With figures who recline, make love or smoke a hookah in luxurious interiors or hidden gardens, Mr. Gardner’s subject may be reverie or maybe indolence, solitary or not, clothed or nude, at home, but mostly, it seems, abroad. Perhaps he intends these quiet carefree scenes to distract us from how carefully he engineers every composition. If so, he succeeds: It takes a while to understand their formal complexity.

2019-03-21,36 Hours in Hoi An,"This ancient town on the Vietnamese coast has charm, history and beauty to spare. It is also budget-friendly, and for foodies, a delight.","Situated on the coast of central Vietnam, the former commercial port of Hoi An offers endless wonders, from fishermen launching bamboo basket boats along palm-fringed beaches, to farmers in conical hats harvesting rice in swathes of green paddies.

Many of the wooden merchant houses and ornate temples and assembly halls — a fusion of styles from China, Europe and Japan — date back to Hoi An’s prime in the 1700s. By the early 1800s, though, the river port was supplanted by Danang to the north, and largely forgotten. Unesco World Heritage site status in 1999 boosted a revival, and in recent years mass tourism has landed hard, with multitudes of tour buses and resorts.

Archibong, 35, originally trained as an architect but is now best known for his work as a furniture and lighting designer, creating sculptural glass pendant lamps and curvy steel chairs with chubby upholstered seats. Four years ago, when he met Philippe Delhotal — the creative director of Hermès Horloger, the Paris-based company’s watch division — his career took another unexpected turn. Delhotal invited Archibong, then a recent graduate of the prestigious L’École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in Switzerland, to create a timepiece for Hermès, and the designer subsequently spent time in the brand’s private archives outside of Paris before developing the Galop, whose case evokes the aerodynamic curves of a racehorse.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/t-magazine/ini-archibong.html

Currently located in Brighton, Williams is now one of the primary creators of what has become a rich field combining comics and health care, broadly conceived. A group of artists, academics and medical professionals now maintain a resource-rich version of the website (graphicmedicine.org), sponsor an annual international conference and oversee a book series. In 2015 they issued the “Graphic Medicine Manifesto,” a part-prose, part-comics title this paper reviewed favorably. Williams, one of the manifesto’s authors, is now out with his second book of graphic fiction, THE LADY DOCTOR (Penn State University, $24.95), which, like his first, “The Bad Doctor,” is set in a small town in Wales and offers the engrossing perspective of a hard-working and fallible physician. Lois Pritchard, 40, single and a secret smoker, wears a sharp black bob and pointy high-heeled boots. A general practitioner, she also works part time at the local Genitourinary Medicine clinic, treating various problems of genital and urinary origins that the book selectively illustrates, including numerous S.T.D.s (“muck in the fuel pipe,” as one man puts it).",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/books/review/new-graphic-medicine.html
