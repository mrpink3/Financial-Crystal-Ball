The typical herd ranged in size from the dozens to the low hundreds. During the 1980s, cheap, federally subsidized grain, an absence of antitrust enforcement, the rise of huge meatpacking companies, and new production techniques devised by those companies turned hogs into industrial commodities — and drove 80 to 90 percent of American hog farmers out of the business.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/books/review/wastelands-corban-addison.html

2022-06-13,The Airmail Cocktail Connects Miami and Cuba,The signature drink of the new Miami bar Airmail was created around 1930 in Cuba by Bacardi.,"The rum-based airmail is the signature cocktail at Airmail, a new bar in Alton Food Hall in Miami Beach. The drink’s history links Miami and Cuba: It is thought to have been created around 1930 by Bacardi, when the company was still based in Cuba, to mark the start of airmail service to Miami. The cocktail was once garnished with a real postage stamp; at the lounge, it comes with a postcard ready to mail, and a paper plane. Sofia Present, the manager and head bartender, uses two ounces of dark rum with 1 ½ tablespoons lime juice and a tablespoon of honey mixed with one-half tablespoon water, all well shaken with ice. Strain it into a coupe and top with about 1 ½ ounces of sparkling wine. Ms. Present prefers dark rum to the more usual white or gold rum for a smoother cocktail.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/dining/airmail-miami.html

It severed its ties with the Paris location, began renovations and has reinvented itself as Chambers. David Lillie, an owner of Chambers Street Wines, remains a partner, along with the beverage director, Pascaline Lepeltier, an award-winning French sommelier; the general manager, Jared David, who had that role at Racines NY; and Jonathan Karis, a former chef de cuisine at Gramercy Tavern and the new executive chef. He describes his food as home cooking, though partly boning a chicken and serving it richly marinated and sizzled on a plancha might not be a home cook’s idea of weeknight dinner. Nonetheless, his food is homier than Racines’s. Black bass with braised artichokes and saffron seasoning, grilled sweetbreads with sauerkraut, Little Gem lettuce with a creamy feta dressing and, for dessert, a phyllo mille-feuille with honey-lemon mascarpone are some other dishes he’s planning. Though the restaurant maintains its substantial cellar, the working wine list is brief, rotates seasonally and has an eye on the environment, with an interest in who made the wine and how. Ms. Lepeltier plans to feature hybrid grapes and have wines from Red Hook Winery and others on tap. “I don’t want to serve wines for the 1 percent,” she said. The renovations have resulted in a somewhat more gracious and coherent space framed by curved pale wood panels, brick walls, a long marble bar, a roomier dining counter at the open kitchen and a communal table in front. There are fewer seats, 55 down from 69, reflecting reduced staffing. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

Notably, the word “slavery” is never directly stated, perhaps as a way to mirror the silence that often surrounds the more shrouded aspects of Jefferson’s legacy. The poem begins in the third person and within the unsaid: “What they never say is: Mr. Jefferson’s still/building,” bringing Jefferson’s ghostly presence into modern times. But in the 10th line, the poem deftly switches to the second person: “You know the room/you were born in? It’s part of the tour,” implicating not only Jefferson’s legacy but also the figurative Monticello in which we live today.

In the evenings, there is live music, including singing from a new balcony stage over the bar, now relocated to a more central position. “It has a combination of luxury elements; it’s built for celebratory moments,” said Jeff Katz, who owns Al Coro with the chef, Melissa Rodriguez.  (She is also the chef and a partner at Mel’s.) Mr. Katz and James Kent, his business partner, recently divided their holdings amicably: Mr. Katz now runs Al Coro and Mel’s, the pizzeria next door, and Mr. Kent is in charge of the Lower Manhattan properties Crown Shy, Saga and Overstory. Mr. Kent said the split made sense from a geographical standpoint. Ms. Rodriguez, who started at Del Posto over 10 years ago and became the executive chef in 2017, described the food as regional Italian. But her tasting dinners ($195 for five courses, $245 for seven), which are detailed by the servers, not printed, involve Italy sporadically. Gremolata and lardo adorn green and white asparagus; frico tops vegetable giardiniera; and a pasta course features culurgiones, a type of dumpling filled with potato, Fontina and mascarpone, with a caviar butter sauce and razor clams. A main course might be a whole roasted sea bass with Marsala and mushrooms, chicken breast done in the style of Peking duck or both on the seven-course menu. Many courses include a collection of savory condiments. The plan is for the menus to be sent to diners the day after their visit, and Ms. Rodriguez plans to change the lineup monthly. There will be a cocktail bar on the spacious lower level. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

2022-06-22,The 25 Most Significant New York City Novels From the Last 100 Years,Four writers and one bookseller gathered over Zoom to make a list devoted to fiction in which the city is more than mere setting.,"What to say about New York? As both a place and an idea, it’s too big to be summed up or even fully known. But that hasn’t stopped countless writers from trying, often via fiction — which, like the city, lends itself to wandering. If anything, New York’s scale and complexity — the diversity of neighborhoods and industries and lives that coexist here — are what make it an inexhaustible and consistently compelling setting. There’s also the fact that it’s so closely associated with ambition, which, as any storyteller will confirm, tends to be a useful thing for a protagonist to have. And so, despite myriad differences in aims and style, the New York City novel has become its own literary category, one that T explored for this project, which compiles what we’ve deemed to be the 25 most influential New York novels published between 1921 and 2021.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/t-magazine/new-york-city-novels-books.html

2022-06-28,How to Choose a Karaoke Song,Choose something in your range. Avoid cold drinks to save your throat.,"“Don’t sing ‘I Will Always Love You’ if you cannot hit those notes,” says Garvaundo Hamilton, 33, who won the Karaoke World Championships in 2020. Just because you like a song does not mean you should sing it. Many classic songs should probably be avoided unless you’re a trained vocalist with an expansive range — including all of Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Journey and Queen, particularly “Bohemian Rhapsody.” If you want to sound good, he also suggests caution when attempting “rap that’s really too fast for you.” Hamilton, a general manager at a print shop in Seattle, goes out to karaoke nearly every night of the week. He spends at least four hours a day singing to himself in the car, in the shower, at his desk and anywhere else he can. Use a karaoke app on your phone to practice. Hamilton keeps a list of go-to songs on his phone divided into different categories, including up-tempo, ballads and duets. His favorite is Alexandra Burke’s version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.” For karaoke, you don’t need to have all the lyrics memorized, but it helps to have practiced a song until you can sing it confidently. Given the choice, Hamilton avoids private karaoke rooms, opting instead for the bar-style public ones where your audience includes strangers. If you’re shy or planning to sing something new, alcohol can sometimes ease nerves. Don’t overdo it, and choose a room-temperature drink. “Cold beverages aren’t good for your throat,” Hamilton says. You don’t have to be a great vocalist, but your skill level should be a consideration when choosing what to sing. An upbeat party song that prompts a singalong can be a good option for so-so singers who might struggle to carry a song alone.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/magazine/choose-karaoke-song.html

2022-06-28,The Disrupter’s Disrupter Tells Us to Ignore Our Instincts,James Bridle’s “Ways of Being” encourages readers to look for intelligence outside the brain box.,"In a tech environment fixated on systemic disruption, the artist and writer James Bridle (who uses they/them pronouns) has earned a reputation as a disrupter among disrupters. In their writing and artwork — and also at the glossy tech conferences where they often speak — Bridle holds forth a dark vision of where big tech has actually led us, for all its utopian claims. In their first book, “New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future,” Bridle depicted a world smothering under dark clouds both literal and figurative, a planet whose ecological and structural collapse cannot even be grasped by its people, obscured as it is in a fog of impenetrable complexity. In Bridle’s view, world culture is currently locked in a vicious and deadly cycle, endlessly insisting “on the power of images and computation to rectify a situation that is produced by our unquestioning belief in their authority.” It’s suicide by data, on a global scale.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/books/review/ways-of-being-james-bridle.html

2022-06-30,"Poem: Beyond Theity, Ity Idiom/Dear Faith",A representation of motion rather than meaning.,"Jane Gregory’s poetry privileges sound — one of poetry’s most powerful aspects — over meaning, looping nonlinearly while stacking and riffing off prior language. The second line is a near replica of the first, sharing most of the same words but rejiggered syntactically so that the tone of the line changes. The minute readers try to grasp onto traditional notions of subject matter, the poem swerves linguistically, forcing us to find meaning in the substance of sound, of movement. The poem itself is a representation of motion rather than meaning, and of the cycles of life where things happen in constant loops of living and tears.
