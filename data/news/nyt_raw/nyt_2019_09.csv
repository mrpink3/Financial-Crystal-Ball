2019-09-01,Joshua Wong and Alex Chow: The People of Hong Kong Will Not Be Cowed by China,You can arrest us. But more protesters will keep coming out.,"HONG KONG — “If we burn, you burn with us.” A famous line in the movie “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay” has been given a new life in Hong Kong’s summer-long protests: It has come to represent the spirit unleashed by hundreds of thousands of protesters. As many commentators have pointed out, the massive, leaderless resistance movement here is a critical front-line battle against the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. A dictatorial party facing domestic and global pressures — especially from the ongoing trade negotiations with the United States — the C.C.P. is getting impatient, apparently. On Friday, it targeted leading activists and politicians in Hong Kong with a round of arrests, possibly signaling that a broader crackdown may be around the corner.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/opinion/hong-kong-protest-joshua-wong.html

About a year after playing P.T. Barnum in “The Greatest Showman,” Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Hart’s 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film “belongs to the accusatory tradition of ‘Ace in the Hole,’ ‘Network’ and ‘Absence of Malice,’ movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion,” he added. “But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-front-runner-and-the-emoji-movie.html

For a good example of the way eras collide in Tirana, just visit Skanderbeg Square, recently renovated with new fountains and rosy granite paving, and home to an 18th-century mosque and minaret, a domed Albanian Orthodox church opened in 2012, a set of government buildings that echo the fascist architecture of Mussolini’s Italy and a Brutalist monolith that houses the National Historical Museum.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/t-magazine/tirana-albania-travel-guide.html

They had known each other since the mid-aughts, sharing both a social circle that revolved around Marlow and many wine-world connections: At the time, the two men (with their respective jobs) were among the only buyers in Brooklyn of the kind of biodynamic, organic, natural wine that has since changed contemporary drinking patterns and palates in nearly every city around the world — and which now fills the shelves of Stranger Wines, their Havemeyer Street storefront that opens this week. Here, inside a 1,000-square-foot space that was, in fact, previously a wine shop (they even kept the same shelves, lightening up the room by adding several Noguchi lanterns and buckets of white paint), McNany and Tarlow are selling bottles from people “who actually grow the grapes and farm the fruit,” says Tarlow, whose restaurant portfolio (Diner, Roman’s, Achilles Heel) has long heralded a similarly intimate, person-to-person ethos. “I would say 99.9 percent of all the bottlings here are done by people who tend to their own land.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/t-magazine/dover-street-market-beauty-stranger-wines-culture-style-news.html

A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama “Lady Bird,” she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeth’s crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.)

2019-09-11,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Spy’ and ‘In the Shadow of the Towers’,Sacha Baron Cohen stars in a Netflix mini-series. And a documentary on HBO revisits 9/11.,"THE SPY Stream on Netflix. Sacha Baron Cohen, the actor best known for assuming false identities as the title characters of the satires “Borat” and “Bruno,” plays a man who himself is assuming a false identity in this six-part mini-series. That man would be Eli Cohen, the real-life Mossad spy who in the 1960s went undercover in Syria and gathered intelligence that is credited with being crucial to Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War. The series, directed by the Israeli filmmaker Gideon Raff, follows Eli Cohen (who is not related to the actor who portrays him) in the early 1960s as he poses as a Syrian shipping magnate. “I saw Eli Cohen, as he was written in the show, as an extreme version of myself,” Baron Cohen said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “The stakes were higher for him, because the price of failure is imprisonment and execution. Eli Cohen was, in that sense, the greatest method actor of the last century.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-the-spy-and-in-the-shadow-of-the-towers.html

INBETWEEN 10 p.m. on FX. Toggling between work and family life can be a challenge no matter your profession, but it’s especially trying for Ray Shoesmith, the contract killer at the center of this series. Outside of work, Ray is also raising a young daughter and trying to foster a new, post-divorce relationship. Played by the Australian actor and writer Scott Ryan, Ray spent the first season both nurturing life and taking it away, easing his daughter into the news that Santa isn’t real in one scene and having a shootout in another. In his review of that season for The New York Times, Mike Hale referred to the show as “another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability — in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and ‘Everybody Loves Raymond.’” The story, Hale added, “deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Ray’s violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor.” Ray will continue straddling that gap in the second season, which debuts Thursday.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-mr-inbetween-and-the-victim.html

Set in the Hackney borough of London, the show counted among its ensemble a pair of rapper-actors (Kane Robinson, who performs as Kano, and Ashley Walters). They played Sully and Dushane, two drug dealers whose rise over the course of the two seasons led to rivalry. Their stories halted after the show’s network, Channel 4, canceled it. Five years later, it has been revived by Netflix — thanks in large part to the involvement of Drake, a fan of the show and an executive producer of its third season. The story resumes with Dushane (Walters) returning from exile in Jamaica to go into business with Sully (Robinson), who gets released from prison after a long sentence.

2019-09-13,"For His First Museum Show in 15 Years, John Currin Turns His Gaze to Men","The artist, who made his name with his polarizing but masterly portraits of women, discusses his lesser-known paintings.","John Currin is best known for painting women, and he has spent his summer on Mount Desert Island, Maine, doing just that: laying the groundwork for a new series of portraits of female subjects whose smiles are stretched by lines of anxiety, whose eyes blaze with to-do lists. He based the faces on models from Sears catalogs and stock photos, but calls the type a “Redbook Juggler,” after the supermarket glossy that advises women on how to cook, shop and dress. While Currin’s exaggerated compositions blow his figures up to kewpie-doll proportions or deflate them into a jumble of jutting elbows and toothy smiles, he renders each inch of flesh in laborious, glowing brushwork that has earned him comparisons to Dutch masters. He was, in fact, exhibited alongside the celebrated Golden Age Dutch painter Cornelis van Haarlem, at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands in 2011, just two decades after his first solo show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 1992 (where his provocative portraits of bold older women elicited accusations of sexism but nevertheless sold out). Currin’s works still draw that criticism on occasion, but not much that he depicts emerges solely from his own imagination. His subjects wash in from the flotsam of American life — kitschy souvenirs and cringey ads, screenshots and centerfolds — and it’s by polishing this lowbrow commerical imagery with a high-art sheen that he manages to make obvious what others might be happy to ignore about our culture.

For example, ask your partner to name the most attractive famous people. “You could then say, ‘Oh, that person is so hot, if they propositioned you, I’d be fine if you had sex with them,’ ” Conley says.

2019-09-18,What Can Brain Scans Tell Us About Sex?,Men’s and women’s brains respond to erotic imagery in pretty much the same way. That could have big implications for how we think about sexuality.,"Men have a far greater appetite for sex and are more attracted to pornography than women are. This is the timeworn stereotype that science has long reinforced. Alfred Kinsey, America’s first prominent sexologist, published in the late 1940s and early 1950s his survey results confirming that men are aroused more easily and often by sexual imagery than women. It made sense, evolutionary psychologists theorized, that women’s erotic pleasure might be tempered by the potential burdens of pregnancy, birth and child rearing — that they would require a deeper emotional connection with a partner to feel turned on than men, whose primal urge is simply procreation. Modern statistics showing that men are still the dominant consumers of online porn seem to support this thinking, as does the fact that men are more prone to hypersexuality, whereas a lack of desire and anorgasmia are more prevalent in women. So it was somewhat surprising when a paper in the prestigious journal P.N.A.S. reported in July that what happens in the brains of female study subjects when they look at sexual imagery is pretty much the same as what happens in the brains of their male counterparts.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/magazine/sex-brain-scans-men-women.html

The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing’s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots — most of them recent graduates of its own academy — and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot’s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/magazine/boeing-737-max-crashes.html

And several Democratic presidential candidates gather for a climate forum.,"ANIARA (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This sci-fi drama from the directors Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja is based on a downbeat 1956 poem by the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earth’s atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the story’s protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. “At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable,” Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-aniara-and-a-climate-forum.html

Their mother bought a three-story townhouse in the Bushwick neighborhood decades earlier, for only $30,000, and by the time she died, a development boom was spilling over from neighboring Williamsburg, driving up values and driving out residents. But Woodson did not find herself dealing with a readily lucrative asset: Because of predatory lending that targeted black homeowners, she says, her mother died owing $300,000, and the house was in foreclosure. “My siblings and I are like, ‘Let’s just short-sell it; let’s just dump it,’ ” Woodson says.

Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera — his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel — he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the ’70s, and there’s something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jang’s eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does) — and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, that’s not why I find them so compelling. There’s something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white — he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols’ Johnny Rotten’s face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantown’s Miyako Hotel. “Michael Jang’s California” is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.

The event itself will go hostless this year, but Jenny McCarthy, Shannon Sharpe and Kelly Osbourne will co-host Fox’s red carpet coverage starting at 6:30 p.m. Over on E!, Giuliana Rancic and Jason Kennedy will do the honors, beginning at 6 p.m. ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday-the-emmys-and-criminal.html

These days balsamic (good, bad and indifferent) usually gets the nod, but in my pantry the workhorse when I want acidity tempered by mellow richness is good Spanish sherry-style vinegar. It’s an honest product not tricked up with caramel. Kitty Keller, an importer in Oakland, Calif., has some that are new to the American market, and they’re beauties. Copper-colored Mas d’en Gil, from Priorat, south of Barcelona, is more tart than sweet; use it to enliven a quick weeknight pan sauce for chicken or pork.
