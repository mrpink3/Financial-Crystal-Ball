A relative newcomer to the game is Kyle Lee, an Alaskan whose company, Alaskan Salmon in Cordova, operates on a smaller scale than some others; it is run by fishermen. The fish are frozen upon harvesting and shipped that way directly to consumers, the typical practice. Alaskan Salmon will charge $75 a pound (about three portions) in five-pound boxes for $375.

Every possible alternative “milk” — pressed from beans, grains, nuts and so forth — now beckon as vanilla and chocolate in the frozen food aisle. A newcomer, Wildgood, has taken a somewhat different approach, with a vegan frozen dessert that relies on olive oil. It’s the result of eight years of trial and error by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who studied gelato in Italy and created an ice cream brand in Greece. Among the ingredients that help turn extra-virgin olive oil into a frozen confection are chicory root, pea protein and carob-bean gum. It’s around 10 percent fat, and there are eight flavors: chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, mango, mint-chocolate chip, sea salt caramel and the best of the lot, pistachio and chocolate-hazelnut. Perhaps using nuts helps with the texture because despite the olive oil, the end result has more of an ice milk lightness instead of the dense richness of a super-premium product.

It’s a lovely summer quaff. “The climate and soils of northern Sonoma County are ideal for producing world-class Bordeaux varietals, particularly sauvignon blanc,” said Craig McAllister, the head winemaker. Bordeaux is the operative term here. The wine, in a clear Bordeaux-style bottle, displays more subtle fruit, notably citrus and pineapple, integrated with good acidity, than the grassy herbaceousness typical of sauvignon blancs from other regions.

Later, as the story goes, he was in a coma for several months and pronounced brain-dead after being hit by a car that dragged him along several blocks. Then he spent time in the infamous Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children until his paternal grandmother — he refers to her simply as “Momo” — was able to take him away at the age of 14.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/arts/design/lonnie-holley.html

I was in my grandmother’s house in Delhi. I was 13, maybe 14. We had a family perfumer, or attarwallah, a man of some refinement, who came to us from Lucknow — a city that is a metonym for high Indo-Islamic culture. We didn’t know the attarwallah’s name, or how he knew to follow us from address to change of address. But he came without fail two or three times a year. A slim, gliding figure, with a mouth reddened from paan, or betel leaf and areca nut, the attarwallah produced his wares from carved bottles of colored glass that he carried in a black leather doctor’s bag. He showed us scents according to which season we were in. So in winter, musk and patchouli; in summer, white-flowered varieties of jasmine — of which there are some 40 odd in India — as well as rose and vetiver. In the monsoon, he brought us mitti attar, which imitates the smell of parched earth exhaling after the first rain (“mitti” means “mud” in Hindi). The perfumes came from the medieval Indian town of Kannauj, which is a 75-mile drive west of Lucknow and which, like its French counterpart, Grasse, has a tradition of perfume manufacturing several centuries old. Once he had drawn his perfume out on white cotton buds at the tips of long, thin sticks, the attarwallah lingered over his customers, telling stories of the various scents and reciting the odd romantic couplet of Urdu poetry.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/fragrance-perfume-orientalism.html

The most prized species make their home in the gullies and wadis of Dhofar in southern Oman and Hadhramaut in war-torn eastern Yemen, and along the cliffs and scarps of the Cal Madow mountains in Somaliland, whose 1991 declaration of independence from Somalia has gone unrecognized by the rest of the world. The Indigenous people of these regions brave snakes and scorpions to climb the trees and press a knife to the papery bark, just enough to break through the green skin beneath.

I am 46, old enough to remember when top models were almost uniformly white, tall and thin, and am still in awe of how, not so very long ago, many of today’s most compelling faces and bodies would never have found a career in fashion at all, rejected before they even tried for being too dark, too small, too large, too queer, too feminine, too masculine. The ability to say “I’m beautiful” — and to really, truly believe it — may not be a fundamental right, but it, too, is revolutionary in its way, reflective of contemporary upheavals in how we perceive race, gender, sexuality, ability and size.

In the kitchen, she prepared the woman’s hair for a wash by removing the extensions that she had previously put in, using her shears to snip the tiny stitches that fastened the wefts — individual strands of hair that are sewn together to create extensions — to her client’s cornrows. Once she had taken those out, LaVar began to unravel the minuscule braids she had plaited months before, starting at the nape. Using her fingers, she carefully unwound them section by section, until all that was left was the woman’s natural hair. After her client took a shower in one of her four bathrooms, LaVar blow-dried her hair and, over the next hour, once again braided each section of the soft hair into thin cornrows. The woman’s hair was naturally fine and, because she often attended events, she was accustomed to this laborious, time-consuming process.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/t-magazine/black-hair-weaves-wigs.html

The office, his fourth home in Richard Peng Hall in as many years, was no great improvement on the earlier three, but at least it overlooked a vaguely collegiate walkway under trees from the window behind the desk, rather than the parking lot of years two and three or the dumpster of year one (when, ironically, he’d been much closer to the height of his literary fame, such as it was, and might conceivably have hoped for something nicer). The only thing in the room that signaled anything of an actual literary nature, that signaled anything of any warmth at all, was the beat-up satchel Jake used to transport his laptop and, on this particular day, the writing samples of his soon-to-arrive students, and this Jake had been carrying around for years. He’d acquired it at a flea market shortly before his first novel’s publication with a certain writerly self-consciousness: acclaimed young novelist still carries the old leather bag he used throughout his years of struggle! Any residual hope of becoming that person now was long gone. And even if it wasn’t there was no way to justify the expense of a new bag.

2021-05-11,"The Beauty Stores, Near and Far, That Are Destinations in Their Own Right","Sought-out spots for picking up finely milled soaps, hand-sculpted makeup brushes, exquisite scents and more.","Beautifying ourselves, and seeking out the best inventions with which to do so, has been a source of comfort for millenniums. In Egypt’s Karnak village, beginning in the 16th century B.C., temples served as early shops and produced scented oils used for perfuming the living, embalming the dead, softening the skin and hair, covering up bad breath and easing sore muscles. In 17th-century Europe, apothecaries sold raw materials — plant oils, mineral powders — that enabled patrons to whip up their own potions to disguise concerns such as gray hair and wrinkles. And as the definition of beauty has evolved, so, too, has the function of the beauty shop. Today, when we tend to think of beauty in more holistic terms, the places that sell creams, powders and pigments are often more than merely points for picking up curative goods: They can be sanctuaries for gathering, broadening the mind, stimulating the senses and perhaps even stirring the soul. In a year when it’s been difficult to physically visit shops, their value has never been more apparent. Here, as part of T’s Beauty & Luxury issue, we pay tribute to just some of our favorite beauty institutions — the sort of spots that feel like discoveries — from a centuries-old perfumery in New Delhi to a sustainably minded apothecary in Vienna to a futuristic emporium-cum-gallery in Seoul.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/t-magazine/beauty-shops-fragrance-skincare.html

Triumphant, she arrived home to a Happy Birthday sign in the front yard, a treat of beignets from a Creole restaurant and the news that her 17-year-old brother did not have pinkeye, as their mother initially suspected, but Covid-19. They all did, it turned out: Sarah, who asked to be identified by her middle name to protect her privacy; her brother; their 85-year-old grandfather; and their mother, a nurse practitioner who started having trouble breathing two days after her son tested positive. Sarah had thought she would first take advantage of her license to drive herself to cheerleading practice; instead, she used it to take her mother to get a coronavirus test, when her mother realized she was already too weak to drive herself. Then, a week later, Sarah’s mother — who had not been leaving the couch and was having trouble finishing her sentences — told her she needed to be driven to the hospital. Her pastor and other members of her church would be checking in, but Sarah would have to look after everyone. That meant taking care of her grandfather, who had Parkinson’s disease and some dementia, and her brother, who had autism. Could she do that? Sarah, whose eyes had grown wide, quickly recovered.

He sensed, and then came to know, that the social problems of what was being called “postindustrial” society would be different from those that came before. He identified these problems, sometimes controversially. In so doing, he predicted the dislocations of the 21st century with uncanny accuracy. He did it with elegance and wit and — this may be a surprise — transcendent humility. His spot-on sense of what truly mattered deserves to be revisited now, if we’re to grope our way past the mess we’ve become as a society.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/books/review/daniel-patrick-moynihan-was-often-right-joe-klein-on-why-it-still-matters.html

These included teeth grinding, cracked and chipped teeth and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, like jaw pain. More than a quarter of the dentists reported an increase in cavities and gum disease — quite likely a result of changes in people’s diets and hygiene. Americans have also had difficulty accessing dental care: A report last month by the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, found that six million adults had lost their dental insurance because of the pandemic, and more than one in 10 had delayed getting care because of cost, lack of insurance, fear of exposure to the virus or a combination of those factors.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/magazine/the-pandemic-was-bad-for-our-teeth-will-it-change-oral-health-forever.html

I said I would use the time to think about how much to actually charge for, say, a plate of brunch eggs, or a Bloody Mary, that would reflect the real cost of doing business, and I said that I would wake Prune up and see what she might look like once I had all those answers in hand.

He details the history of barbecue back to its Indigenous roots in pre-Columbian days, and recounts how it became part of the culture of enslaved Africans. It was entrenched in Black community life, but was taken over by white cooks starting in the late 19th century, he writes. Part of this change was because of urbanization. Instead of pit-roasted whole hogs, smaller cuts of meat like ribs and brisket were used because they were easier to handle in restaurants, and chefs got involved. Now the recognition is improving, he says, but there is work to be done.
