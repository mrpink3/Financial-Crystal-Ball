My parents did, too — they were high school sweethearts — and their stories about hitchhiking to Nags Head as teenagers in the 1960s and seeing bands like the Drifters perform at the local dance hall were the stuff of legend in my mind. As a kid in the ’80s, I loved climbing the massive sand dunes at nearby Jockey’s Ridge State Park and fishing at Cape Hatteras. So I was excited to learn that this month, Steidl will publish a book of images the photographer Joel Sternfeld took in Nags Head in the summer of 1975. Sternfeld’s weatherworn cottages and roadside snack bars bring back memories real and imagined, and I’ll enjoy reliving them with my mom. The book is currently available for preorder, so, in the meantime, I’m eyeing some other ’70s-inspired gifts for Mother’s Day. Vacation’s Orange Gelée sunscreen is reminiscent of the vintage tanning staple Bain de Soleil, and this portable wine chiller designed in 1978 by Richard Carlson is easy to find on eBay. It fits two bottles of wine. Alternatively, Cann Social Tonic’s zero-proof Roadie pouches, infused with 2 milligrams of THC, travel easily to the beach.

Why Tiny Drinks Are on the Rise.",Bartenders are shrinking their pours with variety and festivity in mind.,"Toward the end of the night at Theodora, an elegant Mediterranean restaurant that opened in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood in February, diners at the polished concrete chef’s counter are often treated to the last thing they might expect in such a setting: a shot. It’s a ritual, explains Maggie Dahill, 27, Theodora’s beverage director, designed to encourage guests to feel part of a community. The shots, which the staff also partake in, change nightly and reflect the global inspirations of Theodora’s chef, Tomer Blechman, 46. Some are a perennial presence on the drinks menu, like a diminutive pour of Tubi, a citrus-based Israeli liqueur, or an ice-cold dose of vodka served with a skewered pickled mushroom in homage to the chef’s Latvian family. There’s a nonalcoholic option, as well. (On a recent night, it was a homemade fermented kumquat and rose soda.) “To some degree it’s less about the actual beverage and more about that moment of ‘cheers’ with somebody — that sense of connection,” Dahill says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/t-magazine/tiny-drinks-cocktails-shots.html

Born in 1926, she was raised during the Great Depression and so, Saar wrote to me recently, she was taught to “use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.” That manifesto has guided both her lifelong habit of collecting curios and relics — picked up during her travels to Nigeria, Senegal, Mexico, Haiti and Brazil, and at swap meets in her hometown of Los Angeles — as well as her more than 60-year artistic practice, which similarly brings together and recontextualizes symbols and totems of the Black diaspora. “My daughter Tracye calls me a hoarder who found her calling,” Saar says. Some of the objects that Saar collects have sat unused in her converted-garage studio for years before finding their way into one of her artworks. Saar, who is 97, decides what to reach for based on something she has referred to over the years as “mother wit”: she feels when a wooden statue, antique doll or rusted dagger is calling to be used. Saar considers this selection process to be a sacred one. “I’ve always felt that old objects hold a power,” she says. “They’ve survived, and they have a sense of the previous owner.

Some were shaped like animals; others were recreations of architectural marvels. All of them were as finely chiseled as any likeness carved from stone. Called sotelte (or “subtleties”) in England, culinary masterworks like these were traditionally concocted from a paste of sugar, ground nuts, oils and vegetable gums and gilded or painted with pigments. In Europe, the extravagant sweets first emerged in the late medieval period but, because sugar was prohibitively expensive, were found only on the tables of the wealthy until the 18th century, when the sweetener had become more widely available. Now, thanks to both technology and social media’s penchant for photogenic food, ever wilder and more wondrous treats are showing up at parties and online — trompe l’oeil confections capable not only of tricking the eye but of blowing the mind, too.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/t-magazine/trompe-loeil-candy-sweets.html

Now he’s singing his story.","“I hope you fall in love, I hope it breaks your heart” is the refrain (in English translation) of “Pasoori,” Ali Sethi’s 2022 global hit. Is this a curse or a blessing? The song, performed as a duet with the Pakistani singer Shae Gill, defies such simple classifications — it’s a pop banger sung in Urdu and Punjabi, punctuated with flamenco handclaps and driven by a reggaeton beat. Sethi, a Pakistani-born artist who lives in Manhattan’s East Village, composed it in the wake of a thwarted collaboration with an Indian organization that feared reprisal (because of a 2016 ban on hiring Pakistani creatives). Drawing on themes from ghazals — sly courtesan poems about desire and betrayal that have doubled as political critiques, a genre that dates to seventh-century Arabia — “Pasoori” is at once “a love song, a bit of a flower bomb thrown at nationalism, a queer anthem, a protest song, a power ballad [and] a song of togetherness,” Sethi says. It’s now been viewed some 850 million times on YouTube, including by countless Indian fans.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/t-magazine/ali-sethi-pasoori.html
2024-05-10,The Black Female Artists Redefining Minimalism,A new generation of painters and sculptors is finding creative freedom by making rigorously pared-down work.,"JENNIE C. JONES was a 20-year-old art student when she first saw the work of the minimalist painter and sculptor Ellsworth Kelly installed at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989. These were some of Kelly’s signature panels: bold, monochromatic shapes of saturated color in oil on canvas. They were flat like paintings but sculptural in their defiance of right angles. Jones recalls being struck most of all by what Kelly’s work displaced. It occupied the second floor of the museum’s two-story sculpture court, which had been redesigned the previous year to showcase classical sculpture and painting. “They took down all these other artists to put up this suite,” Jones says. “I was so secretly envious that Kelly was able to hold that space.” Such freedom claimed by a renowned white male artist stood in contrast to her own growing sense as a young Black woman artist of being pigeonholed, of that same freedom — of space, of form — not being available to her.

Think of the perfectly sliced green scallions, thin and trembling like blades of grass, that accompany a Peking duck or the way beef sliced for a stir-fry instantly cooks on a heated wok, evenly seared on the outside, still juicy and tender within.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/books/review/chop-fry-watch-learn-michelle-t-king.html

All pasta was a rarefied food in the Middle Ages, but few forms captured the popular imagination as completely as stuffed pasta, considered the noblest of the species. In “The Decameron,” a 14th-century collection of stories by Giovanni Boccaccio about a group of young Florentines who abandon the city for the countryside during the plague, one of the characters, Maso del Saggio, describes an idyllic landscape to entertain the friends: “On a mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese, dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and raviuoli.” Centuries later, every corner of Italy has its own version of filled pasta, which is broadly referred to as ravioli throughout the country. The “Encyclopedia of Pasta” (2009), the Italian food historian Oretta Zanini De Vita’s decades-long effort to catalog Italy’s most popular food, identifies more than 80 types of pasta ripiena (“stuffed pasta”), allowing for countless variations.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/t-magazine/stuffed-pasta-piedmont-italy-agnolotti-del-plin.html

Although the name is widely believed to derive from anello, which means “ring,” anolini can be half-moons, too. Whatever the shape, they’re defined by their filling of stracotto: beef braised in wine until surrounded by a gravy-like sauce called a fondo. At Osteria del Trentino, near the old armory in Piacenza, several hundred anolini are prepared every other day in the restaurant’s small kitchen. The minced stracotto is mixed with bread crumbs, Parmesan and some of the fondo, then enclosed in fresh egg pasta. Each anolino is the size of a bottle cap, with a similarly serrated edge, and is cooked in what’s called brodo di terza (“broth of thirds”), the name referencing the three types of meat — beef, veal and chicken — that are simmered in water to produce a golden, flavorful broth.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/t-magazine/guide-ravioli-stuffed-pasta.html

When his sons Giorgio and Constantino inherited the family business after their father’s death in 1932, they expanded into high jewelry, playing with Art Deco accents and geometric motifs. By the 1950s, the house of Bulgari was already famous for its eye-catching mix of precious and multicolored stones. Influenced by the cupolas on basilicas across Rome, the brand’s trademark vibrant cabochons — smooth, rounded stones that don’t refract light the way faceted gems do — became ubiquitous. A yellow gold bib necklace from 1968, with its emeralds, amethysts and turquoise stones, epitomized the daring chromatic combinations of the era and was worn by the Upper East Side It girl Lyn Revson, the wife of the cosmetics magnate Charles Revson, a co-founder of Revlon.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/t-magazine/lotus-cabochon-bulgari-necklace.html

2024-05-14,"Black Satire Is Having Its Hollywood Moment, but Something Is Missing",Recent releases like “American Fiction” and “The American Society of Magical Negroes” have used absurdist humor to examine race. But they have also depicted narrow views of Blackness.,"In 2017, Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” was a critical and commercial smash that immediately became one of the defining movies of the Trump Era. The next year, Boots Riley’s masterful “Sorry to Bother You” seemed to herald a new golden age for Black satire films. But as those movies stood out for using surreal plot twists to humorously — and horrifically — unpack complex ideas like racial appropriation and consumer culture, the crop that has followed hasn’t kept pace. The current moment is defined by a central question: What does the “Black” look like in Black satire films today? Too often lately it’s “not Black enough.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/arts/black-satire-films-american-fiction.html

The answer is complex. Myriad factors — including genetics, environment, stress levels, hormonal changes, medical conditions and diet — can lead to blemishes at any stage in life. Some of these triggers can send sebaceous glands, the tiny organs that lubricate your skin with oil, into overdrive, clogging your pores. That buildup of oil and dead skin can then become a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria. While some variables aren’t always in our control, the best defense against adult acne is a consistent, strategic skin care routine. (A few other basic rules: Try to keep your hands away from your face as much as possible, use a clean towel after cleansing and wash your bed linens weekly.)

To that end, they’ve filled the 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom, which is on the eighth floor of a ’60s-era building overlooking the North Sea, with works by some of their favorite artists and designers, many of whom are also their clients.

I also bought the Worldwide Trip Protector plan from Travel Insured International (for $1,954), in part because it covered financial default and bankruptcy of cruise lines. Vantage then canceled the cruise and offered me an alternative date I could not make; I also declined their offer of credit and asked for a refund, which they agreed to. But no refund ever came, and they stopped answering the phone. My credit card returned the $2,000, and I filed an insurance claim for $17,905. It was denied, as was my first appeal. Then Vantage filed for bankruptcy, and my second appeal was denied too. The reasons given by the insurer were outrageous. They cited a vague parenthetical phrase in the policy’s bankruptcy clause, claiming I wasn’t covered because I purchased the cruise directly from the cruise line (rather than, say, through a travel adviser). Then they said my policy lapsed when I canceled the trip. But I did not cancel; Vantage did. I also filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Financial Services, which was rejected.

2024-05-16,"Saintly, Seductive or Sadistic? Why We Can’t Make Up Our Minds About Nuns.","In uncertain times, religious sisters are often invoked as vessels for collective doubt.","From Chaucer’s supercilious Madame Eglantine in “The Canterbury Tales,” with her spoiled lap dogs and secular French airs, to Ryan Murphy’s ruthless Sister Jude in 2012’s “American Horror Story: Asylum,” a woman who wears a red negligee under her habit and is not above indulging in some communion wine, fictional portrayals of nuns have long captured and confounded the imagination. How could it be otherwise? The sisters’ vows of chastity and poverty and the air of secrecy that shrouds their cloistered lives are all intriguingly antithetical to modern Western values of sex, money and fame.
