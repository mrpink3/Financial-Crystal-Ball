2019-12-03,A Furniture Designer Who Learned Under Raf Simons,"Michaël Verheyden, who combines simple shapes with rich textures, will show a new collection at Design Miami.","As a student at Belgium’s LUCA School of Arts in the late ’90s, Michaël Verheyden counted the fashion designer Raf Simons as a mentor — he even modeled for Simons before launching his own line of handbags. Yet he graduated with a degree in industrial design, which he put to use when he and his wife, the designer Saartje Vereecke, bought their first home, in Genk, in 2009. After failing to find the sort of furniture they’d envisioned for the space, they started making their own pieces, and have been experimenting with clean-lined forms ever since. Verheyden’s latest collection, Archetypes, a 20-piece range that the Belgian gallerist Pierre Marie Giraud is showing at Design Miami, includes brass lamps, marble tables and a classic oak screen. It was inspired by the work of Donald Judd and Jean-Michel Frank, and, like them, Verheyden is interested in simple structures, but also in rich textures. “If I design a chair, I want people to recognize its basic shape — but then I like to play with the materials,” he says. Indeed, the collection’s benchlike sofa is strung with Manila cord and sits atop gouged oak legs evoking snakeskin, while a decorative brass bowl is polished smooth in parts but left rough and unfinished at its base. With his Tabula Runda writing desk, though, Verheyden plays with form as well: It contains two hidden drawers and legs that have been moved from the edges to the center, challenging our notions of just what an ideal table might be. As Verheyden says, “The answer is always to look at something long enough to see how I might change it.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/t-magazine/michael-verheyden.html

2019-12-05,Times Critics’ Top Books of 2019,The Times’s staff critics give their choices of the best fiction and nonfiction works of the year.,"In the literary world, it has been a year of big, bold ambition. Novelists have stretched their canvases — writing a sentence that runs for a thousand pages; charting the fate of three families in Africa across four generations. Nonfiction writers have made riveting narrative from sprawling, difficult material: The Irish Troubles, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the history of the Lakota tribe. And memoirists have confronted harrowing and profound subjects: Life in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina; decades spent in solitary confinement; psychological abuse in intimate relationships. Below, The New York Times’s three daily book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — share their thoughts about their favorites among the books they reviewed this year, each list alphabetical by author.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/books/times-critics-top-books-of-2019.html

The country’s isolated southern island state has been so overlooked in the past, it’s even been left off maps of Australia. In recent years, however, Australians have changed their tune. Tasmania is experiencing a surge of weekenders and property buyers, driven by a newfound interest in its pristine nature, unhurried way of life and an increasingly diverse food and art scene that really started to take off with the arrival, in a Hobart suburb, of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in 2011. The biggest transformation has taken place in the once-sleepy capital of Hobart, which now boasts a plethora of creative new restaurants and an edgy spirit, particularly during the winter Dark Mofo festival. (A highlight: the nude solstice swim in the chilly River Derwent.) Tasmania’s profile is rising overseas, as well. International visitors jumped by 21 percent from mid-2017 to mid-2018 — the biggest rise by far of any Australian state. Tasmanians have always known how good the life is here.

(Before I did, I told a Jesuit friend that I had doubts. “Who doesn’t?” he said.) So the spiritually minded books on this week’s list hold particular interest for me. There’s Karen Armstrong’s “The Lost Art of Scripture,” which argues for a literary view of sacred texts, and Jack Miles’s “Religion as We Know It,” a history of belief and its place in culture. There’s Melvin Konner’s “Believers,” which looks for scientific and psychological explanations for the persistence of faith, and, less overtly but no less appealingly, the questing and philosophical poems in Charles Wright’s “Oblivion Banjo.” Any of those might do nicely to set the mood this week, as readers of various faiths and denominations hurtle toward their high holidays.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/books/review/11-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2019-12-10,A Swiss Watch That Lets You in on Its Secrets,"Through the back of Vacheron Constantin’s luxurious new timepiece, you can see what makes it tick.","History often treats the engineering marvels of the 21st century as exponentially more virtuosic than what came before, but consider the tourbillon. Created in 1795 by the Paris-based watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, a favorite of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the mechanism (French for “whirlwind”) is perhaps the most esoteric and elegant watch complication ever conceived. Born of horology’s obsession with maintaining accuracy to the millisecond, the tourbillon counteracts the effect of the earth’s gravity by constantly rotating the cage that holds the timepiece’s balance wheel, balance spring and escapement while the movement is running. The idea was to eliminate errors in rate — the loss or gain in time that would arise if the watch stayed too long in one position — by crafting an internal apparatus that continually turned on an axis. Such a marvel of intricacy must be witnessed to be fully understood: It is as transfixing as watching a heart beat. In this new incarnation by the Swiss company Vacheron Constantin, which has specialized in rarefied timepieces since its founding in 1755, you can stare at it all you want through the round porthole at the bottom of the blue lacquer dial or through its sapphire crystal back. Because the case is fashioned from stainless steel instead of the platinum or gold used for most tourbillon watches, this exemplar of late 18th-century ingenuity seems decidedly contemporary — and, perhaps, ever so slightly less beyond our grasp.

But putting it in the No. 1 slot for the year isn’t a close call. Not that Mercado Little Spain is without flaws. It has its share, starting with a name that’s too long. But it has made the city’s Spanish food scene, what, five times better? Ten times? Mercado Little Spain gives us ingredients we’ve never tasted in New York before, like weeks-old Ibérico pigs slowly melted over fire, or imported rabbit — so flavorful that nobody will say it tastes like chicken — in the Valencian paella cooked over burning logs. It also sells high-fidelity transcriptions of dishes from the chefs Ferran Adrià, whose liquid olives are still blowing minds, and his brother, Albert, who fed recipes to the outstanding pastry department. Somehow, though, the most impressive foods are the most elementary: the gazpacho that shimmers with olive oil and sherry vinegar; the thick, dark hot chocolate that comes with churros just out of the fryer; the goblets of gin and tonics. These and other dishes are so much better than what we’re used to that Mercado Little Spain might as well be the only Spanish restaurant in New York.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/dining/best-restaurant-nyc-pete-wells.html

Small and pumpkin-shaped, like miniature bell peppers, they can be found in deli cases stuffed with cubes of provolone and wisps of prosciutto, on antipasto platters at weddings and funerals or suspended in vinegar in big jars at the sub shop, hot and sweet at once, with a zing of sour acidity that makes them an ideal topping for a sandwich of cured meats and salty cheese. Sometimes I pair pickled hot cherry peppers with fried eggplant and mozzarella on a sesame hero with a swipe of mayonnaise. I like them with chunks of Parmesan, with raw clams, with coins of soppressata.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/magazine/cherry-pepper-italian-american-sauce-recipe.html

Pollsters often have to dial hundreds of landline and cellphone numbers before someone answers. The first few seconds of contact are especially crucial. “Obviously that person can’t see your smile, but they can hear it,” Charter says. During training sessions, Charter makes each student turn to a partner and try to say something unkind with a big smile on his or her face. “It still sounds friendly,” Charter says. Then she makes each student say nice things while scowling. “It doesn’t work.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/magazine/how-to-keep-a-stranger-on-the-phone.html

2019-12-11,The Curious Case of the U.S. Government’s Influence on 20th-Century Design,"Known for its intelligence-gathering operations during World War II, the O.S.S. also helped shape the look of modern life.","THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES was the first centralized foreign intelligence agency in the United States, the direct precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. Founded during World War II by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the O.S.S. (or the Coordinator of Information, as it was originally called) was established “to collect, analyze, and correlate information and data bearing on national security, to make such data available to the President and such other officials as determined by the President, and to perform related supplementary activities.” And yet its role soon became much larger and more influential. The head of the O.S.S., Colonel William “Wild Bill” Donovan, quickly realized that the information produced by the global war, fought on multiple fronts and territories, needed to be painstakingly abstracted, graphically depicted and efficiently presented. The O.S.S. mission expanded to include not only information gathering through research and counterintelligence but also packaging and interpreting that information for the president and other key decision makers. Propaganda played a crucial role during World War II, with the O.S.S. leading efforts to demoralize the enemy and encourage resistance in Axis-controlled countries. They created a stamp bearing the face of Hitler rendered as a skull, produced radio broadcasts in German, spread pamphlets announcing a German general’s resignation and made films for new military recruits, such as the Hollywood producer Darryl F. Zanuck’s circa 1943 “Organization of the Army,” which was commissioned by General George C. Marshall. Through its manipulation of the art of information, the agency helped shape the look and philosophy of American imperialism. In doing so, the O.S.S. assembled a concentration of acumen and talent that rivaled those of the iconic schools and institutes that propagated design in the 20th century. It was the Bauhaus, but for war.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/t-magazine/us-government-20th-century-design.html

And a documentary about Caroll Spinney is streaming on Topic.,"LONG SHOT (2019) 10:10 p.m. on HBO. Love blooms in the din of an underground bomb shelter in this romantic comedy, which stars Charlize Theron as a United States secretary of state running for president and Seth Rogen as a journalist who becomes her beau. The “long shot” in the title refers to both the presidential bid and the unlikely romance that the pair develops: Charlotte (Theron) used to babysit Fred (Rogen). Their meet-cute adult reunion happens at a lavish charity event, where Fred (the only neon windbreaker in a sea of suits) manages to trip down a staircase in front of an assembly of distinguished guests. The rest of the story involves Charlotte hiring Fred as a speechwriter and a journey abroad that lands the pair in that snug bomb shelter. “Much of what happens isn’t surprising,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, “but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes.” The movie was directed by Jonathan Levine, who also directed Rogen in “50/50” and “The Night Before.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-long-shot-i-am-big-bird.html

And a documentary about Mel Brooks airs on HBO.,"BUMBLEBEE (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Many blockbuster prequels tell the origin story of a flesh-and-blood superhero or villain. This one tells the tale of a Volkswagen Beetle. Or, more precisely, it tells an origin story of a robot hero who can morph into a yellow car. That robot would be Bumblebee, once the metal partner of Shia LaBeouf’s character in the various Michael Bay “Transformers” movies. Bumblebee is here reimagined as the sidekick of a 1980s Northern California teenager played by Hailee Steinfeld. Together, the pair defends the earth from evil robots. This movie was directed by Travis Knight, a filmmaker who built his career on stop-motion animation. He cut back on some of the profuse chaos that defined the earlier “Transformers” films, working off a screenplay by Christina Hodson. The result, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, is “cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking.” It’s “springy yet coherent,” he added, “not, like previous films in the series, a digital-image blender set on high.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-bumblebee-and-mel-brooks-unwrapped.html

She appeared to be about 15 and was wearing a hoodie, with dyed hair; she generally looked the part of a rebellious, sullen teen. Walking behind him, the daughter kicked at her father’s heels. He responded by whipping around and throwing his full cup of coffee in her face. She responded with a number of expletives, but seemed unfazed and unhurt.

2019-12-17,How to Spot a Counterfeit Watch,Get close. Is the second hand moving smoothly? Does the engraved lettering look good?,"“Is the second hand ticking in a herky-jerky-type motion?” asks Paul Altieri, founder of Bob’s Watches, one of the largest online retailers of used luxury watches. A twitchy second hand probably means you’re looking at a quartz-movement watch powered by a battery. Altieri specializes in Rolexes, which almost always run on automatic movement, where the motion of a wearer’s wrist winds an intricate system of tiny gears and springs, resulting in a smoother, sweeping second hand. Altieri can make out a cheap quartz fake from five feet away, but recently he has seen more almost-perfect impostors, what he calls “superfakes.” To catch these, you need a 10x magnifying glass and lots of time. “It really helps if you have a real one right next to it to compare,” he says. Would-be sellers send Altieri and his team of five inspectors about 700 used Rolexes a month. Usually fewer than 10 are fakes.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/magazine/fake-rolex-watch.html

2019-12-17,Four Emerging Knitwear Brands to Know,"A new wave of small labels focuses exclusively on modern versions of traditional knits, from Aran sweaters to Breton tops.","Four years ago, the London-based marketing executive Cassie Holland set out to make pure wool sweaters for herself and her close friends. As a rock music fan, she strove to channel the D.I.Y. ethos laid out in the self-taught musician Viv Albertine’s 2014 feminist punk memoir “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.” The resulting pieces — a collection of youthful, boldly hued knits made from merino and lamb’s wool and adorned with the knitted names of beloved bands such as Devo and Joy Division — quickly found a following on Instagram. Last year, Holland won the British Fashion Council’s Fashion Potential Award, and while the brand’s international profile is growing, she is committed to working with British and family-run businesses, both in the Pennine mountains of Yorkshire, where her yarn is milled, and in Hawick, Scotland, where her sweaters are crafted by hand. For recent collections, she has drawn inspiration from sources including Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel “Mrs. Dalloway” (which prompted woven slogans like “melancholy” and “true self”) and the color combinations found on old covers of The Paris Review.

Created for FX and BBC One by Steven Knight (best known for “Peaky Blinders”), this three-part, not-for-kids version of the Christmas staple stars Guy Pearce as Ebenezer Scrooge, who travels back to his childhood with the Ghost of Christmas Past (given eerie form here by Andy Serkis). The journey touches on some heavy subjects: sexual abuse, neglect (particularly by Scrooge’s father, played by Johnny Harris) and other cruelties. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Knight explained the reasoning behind some of the show’s more disturbing elements — like the abuse — that make for an especially troubling telling of the story. “I wanted to look at these things, not to disrupt or be shocking, but to say the things one can say now,” he said. “I am trying to make some suggestions about why Scrooge is Scrooge.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/arts/whats-on-tv-thursday-a-christmas-carol-and-cold-case-hammarskjold.html

Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “The first, though intriguing, is more puzzling than illuminating.

Willem Dafoe throws on a fur coat and hat and takes to the snow-covered mountains in this adventure film, which has skipped theaters in favor of a debut on Disney’s new streaming service.

It’s often associated with Balto, the dog that completed the run (and got a 1990s big-screen animated feature out of the deal). The new movie focuses on a different dog, Togo, and his trainer and musher (played by Dafoe). The story creates drama from a classic combination of heroism and harsh conditions. “It’s going to be bad,” Dafoe’s character says early in the film, sizing up the coming storm.

That season played something like “Dexter” crossed with a soap opera: It followed Joe, a killer, as he pursued a romantic obsession in New York City (the relationship didn’t pan out). The new, second season moves the action to the West Coast. It gives Joe a job at a gourmet market and a fresh fixation: a co-worker played by Victoria Pedretti. “The new location allows the showrunner, Sera Gamble, and her staff to add Southern California stereotypes to the generational and class formulas that draw Joe’s scorn,” Mike Hale wrote in his review of the second season for The New York Times, “and to throw the Hollywood melodrama into the genre blender along with the rom-com.” He called the show “one of television’s more addictive treats.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-you-and-girlhood.html

Visitors today will find a city that seems at first glance unlovable: One of the most famous songs about the city — and an example of a Recife music genre called manguebeat, or mangrove beat — is called “Rivers, Bridges and Overpasses” (“Rios, Pontes e Overdrives”), and that’s what Recife’s center looks like, to a large extent.

In Pennington, southwest of New Brunswick, Blue Moon Acres is cultivating assorted rices. There are medium- and long-grain brown rice; white sushi rice; a mix of short-grain brown and black rice, called black and tan, that turns purplish when cooked; and an Italian rice, short-grain Maratelli, for risotto and paella. The rices are husked to order and delivered very fresh, so they often need slightly shorter cooking times than recommended. They are grown according to Korean natural farming techniques that encourage the growth of healthy microorganisms in the soil to eliminate the need for chemical applications. They are also said to be uncontaminated by heavy metals like arsenic, which have been found in some rice crops.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/dining/new-jersey-rice-blue-moon-acres.html

The effect was to leave an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior. That was not his intent. He went on instead to argue that culture and history are crucial factors in Jewish achievements and that, as he put it, “At its best, the West can honor the principle of racial, religious and ethnic pluralism not as a grudging accommodation to strangers but as an affirmation of its own diverse identity.

After 28 of them, we’ve reached the 1950s, and a 30-something Sheeran has just learned that a neighborhood grocer shoved his daughter. This younger Sheeran is still played by the 76-year-old De Niro; digital effects have been used to take years off his face, a technique that’s applied to a few actors as the film moves through time. And it’s this curiously smooth De Niro who marches the daughter back to the store, throws the grocer to the curb and stomps repeatedly on his hand.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/magazine/the-irishman-robert-de-niro.html
