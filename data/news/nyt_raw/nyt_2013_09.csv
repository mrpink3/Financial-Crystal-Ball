(TCM) THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY Turner Classic Movies begins a 15-week festival of 119 films and dozens of short subjects representing 29 countries and 6 continents, and centered on Mark Cousins’s 2012 examination of the birth and evolution of cinema, and the innovations in storytelling, style and technology that resulted in its current form. Mr. Cousins, a film critic from Northern Ireland, “aims for comprehensiveness and coherence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this 900-minute movie, presented in eight chapters. “He wants to tell the whole story, from Genesis to Revelation, as the saying goes, but he also wants this vast chronicle to have a shape and a point: themes and patterns amid the names, places and images. He succeeds to an impressive extent. The results of his dogged research, compulsive travel and hard thinking are exemplary, useful and sometimes thrilling.” Mr. Cousins and Robert Osborne will introduce each Monday episode, which begins here with movies from Thomas Edison’s New Jersey studio, at 8, and the Lumière brothers’ French studio, at 9:30, and “Birth of the Cinema (1900-1920),” the first episode of Mr. Cousins’s film, at 10. Georges Méliès’s short “Trip to the Moon” (1902), follows at 11:15, and Alice Guy-Blaché’s shorts “Falling Leaves” (1912), “Canned Harmony” (1912) and “A House Divided” (1913), at 11:30. The lineup concludes with three silent films: Oscar C. Apfel’s “Squaw Man” (1914), about a wrongly accused Englishman who escapes to Wyoming and takes an American Indian bride, at 12:30 a.m.; “D. W. Griffith’s Civil War epic, “The Birth of a Nation” (1915), at 2; and his “Orphans of the Storm” (1921), above, starring Lillian and Dorothy Gish as sisters struggling to find each other during the French Revolution, at 5:15.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2013-09-03,What’s on Tuesday,Television highlights.,"5:10 P.M. (MoreMax) MAGIC MIKE (2012) In a role loosely inspired by his stint as a stripper in Florida, Channing Tatum, above center, stars as the gyrating main attraction at the Xquisite dance club, in what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called “Steven Soderbergh’s funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream.” Alex Pettyfer plays Adam, a college dropout who is pushed onstage at Xquisite. At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” begins to throb. “What happens will be familiar if you’ve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “In the past, the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here, the stress is on Mike’s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture.” She added: “The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie’s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum’s heat and charm — and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike’s — with Mr. Soderbergh’s cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

His latest series — enigmatic images of peeling, weather-worn billboards — will be published in a Sam Shahid-designed monograph next month, and can be seen at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York.

As many of us have noted, the central bank has very little direct traction when safe short-term rates are at the zero lower bound; maybe it can achieve something by buying lots of unconventional assets (“quantitative easing”), but its main hope of achieving anything is through “expectations management” — convincing both financial markets and players in the real economy that it will hold off much longer on tightening once the economy improves than they currently expect, which will lead to higher expected inflation and demand, and hence higher spending now.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/summers-the-shiftless/

2013-09-03,A Sweet German Riesling With Steamed Fish,The fragility of the wine perfectly fits this dish’s delicacy.,"For this gentle steamed fish, one wine stands out as a brilliant match: lightly sweet German riesling, at either kabinett or spätlese levels of ripeness. The fragility of the wines perfectly fits the delicacy of the fish, while their snappy acidity and suggestion of sweetness will softly buttress the flavors of the fish and seasonings. Even so, other choices will work well, as long as they are not overpowering, tannic or deficient in acidity. You could try an Austrian grüner veltliner or any number of crisp Italian whites. If you prefer a red, try lighter pinot noirs from New Zealand or Oregon, perhaps, or airy reds from northern Italy like Valpolicella or grignolino. ",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/dining/a-sweet-german-riesling-with-steamed-fish.html

But its extraordinary success — the movie went on to earn $471 million at box offices worldwide — subsequently helped spawn Hollywood’s now-conventional wisdom that if you’re going to make a blockbuster, then summer, when kids are out of school and people are in search of industrial-strength air-conditioning, is the best time to release it.

2013-09-04,Chile: 3 Sue Over Sexual Abuse Cases,Three men who say they were sexually abused as teenagers by a prominent Catholic priest filed a lawsuit against the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago.," Three men who say they were sexually abused as teenagers by a prominent Catholic priest filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago for failing to protect them or to investigate their accusations. Juan Carlos Cruz said that he and the others who have accused the Rev. Fernando Karadima of abusing them when he headed the El Bosque parish in Santiago in the 1980s “hope to establish the responsibility of the church, which always knew what was going on and looked the other way.” In 2011, the Vatican found Rev. Karadima guilty of the abuses and ordered him to retire “to a life of prayer and penitence.” A Chilean judge dismissed criminal charges later that year because a statute of limitations had expired, but he also described the accusations as “truthful and reliable.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/world/americas/chile-3-sue-over-sexual-abuse-cases.html

More than just about any drama on television, he said, “Luther” would be nothing without its star, “who strides through the show — he’s constantly on the move — with such authority that the exaggerations and the risible plot twists don’t intrude on your enjoyment, for the most part.” They, and Mr. Elba, he added, “are still pretty epic.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/arts/television/whats-on-wednesday.html

But cleaning up a country doesn’t come without moral hazards.,"Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, agreed to meet me at 11 a.m. on a recent Saturday. Kagame’s office is on top of a hill near the center of Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, and I took a taxi there, driven by a man in a suit and tie. Whenever I’m in Kigali, I am always impressed by how spotless it is, how the city hums with efficiency, which is all the more remarkable considering that Rwanda remains one of the poorest nations in the world. Even on a Saturday morning, platoons of women in white gloves rhythmically swept the streets, softly singing to themselves. I passed the Union Trade Center mall in the middle of town, where traffic circulates smoothly around a giant fountain. There was no garbage in the streets and none of the black plastic bags that get tangled up in the fences and trees of so many other African cities — Kagame’s government has banned them. There were no homeless youth sleeping on the sidewalks or huffing glue to kill their hunger. In Rwanda, vagrants and petty criminals have been scooped up by the police and sent to a youth “rehabilitation center” on an island in the middle of Lake Kivu that some Rwandan officials jokingly call their Hawaii — because it is so lush and beautiful — though people in Kigali whisper about it as if it were Alcatraz.

2013-09-04,"Feeling For | Nashville, New and Improved","With a glut of new restaurant and retail openings this fall, Nashville seems ready to become the next hipster enclave of the South.","Nashville has spent the past few years slowly cultivating a more hipster-friendly identity, not unlike that of Austin, Tex., its spiritual compadre to the west. This fall, the city ups the ante in its bid to become the Williamsburg of the South. In the trendy Gulch neighborhood, the architect Nick Dryden has helped lead the transformation, designing hip spaces for clothing designer Billy Reid and for the denim mecca Imogene + Willie. Dryden’s latest endeavor, the 404 Hotel & Kitchen, which opens in October, is in an old garage next to a bluegrass landmark, the Station Inn, and preserves many of the original structure’s rustic charms: loftlike rooms with exposed ceiling beams and concrete floors (404 12th Avenue South). Then there’s Benjamin and Max Goldberg, the brothers behind the much buzzed-about restaurant the Catbird Seat. Next month they’ll open Pinewood Social — part restaurant, part bar and part hipster country club, with vintage bowling lanes, an outdoor pool, bocce-ball courts and karaoke rooms (33 Peabody Street). Chef Josh Habiger, who designed Pinewood’s menu, will also be cooking at Music City Eats, Nashville’s first food and music festival, the brainchild of the celebrity chef Jonathan Waxman and the local rockers Caleb and Nathan Followill of Kings of Leon (Sept. 21-22).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/feeling-for-nashville-new-and-improved/

2013-09-05,What’s on Thursday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, Marcus, a solemn boy, feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left Marcus adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. “Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,” A. O. Scott said in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. “What does seem new — newly strange, newly beautiful — is what ‘Hereafter’ makes of the here and now,” Mr. Scott added. “It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it’s wonderful.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

A stuffed goat, a torn shirt or tie, a wheelbarrow and even his own bed — all became fodder for paintings or sculptures, which would later incorporate sound and electronics as well. Rauschenberg had a counterpart in the Swiss-born Jean Tinguely, who had his debut at the Museum of Modern Art after arriving in New York in January 1960. The show consisted of a gigantic motorized sculpture assembled from bicycle wheels, a piano, a bathtub and other detritus, which was designed to self-destruct in flames before a live audience. Rauschenberg made an ad hoc contribution to the piece with a toaster that spit out silver dollars. That “collaboration” spurred a lifelong friendship that would embrace other bricoleurs of the French “New Realist” group then living in New York: Arman, Martial Raysse and Tinguely’s future wife, Niki de Saint Phalle — all artists who subscribed to Rauschenberg’s belief in closing the gap between art and life. This month, the Sperone Westwater gallery brings the group together again with “Radio Waves: New York ‘Nouveau Réalisme’ and Rauschenberg,” an exhibition of 13 rarely seen scrap assemblages and drawings from the artist’s personal collection (Sept. 17 to Nov. 2).",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/on-view-robert-rauschenberg-and-the-new-realists-in-new-york/

They wield blowtorches and wear fireproof suits in the crushing heat, and — according to reporting by Ernesto Londoño at The Washington Post — it takes about 12 hours to demolish each of the vehicles. The trucks need to be cut into pieces small enough to be fed into industrial metal shredders, which grind the parts down into tiny bits of scrap that are sold locally for a few cents per pound. In May, about 11 million pounds of this scrap were apparently sold; by now it is probably more.

The members of the special grand jury convened two years after those desperate days were in agreement that the state of Louisiana should not indict Dr. Anna Pou for the murder of four patients during the disaster. Why then, did they nevertheless continue to believe that a “crime had occurred”? The only crime they had been assembled to investigate was homicide, the evidence for and against which they had been studying for weeks.

No genre-bending this time, the novel seems to say: spanning 80 years and three generations, it realistically portrays an enchanted — or disenchanted — garden of American revolutionaries.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/books/review/jonathan-lethems-dissident-gardens.html

2013-09-06,What’s on Friday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012) Jessica Chastain, in an Oscar-nominated role, portrays Maya, a C.I.A. officer obsessed with finding Osama bin Laden, in Kathryn Bigelow’s fictionalized intelligence procedural. (Above, Ms. Chastain with Christopher Stanley.) Tushaar Mehra is Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the lead that Maya and her colleagues, including Dan (Jason Clarke) and Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), chase over the next eight years, using controversial interrogation techniques on prisoners to extract information. “The abuse scenes are crucial to ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ because they serve as a claim — one made cinematically rather than with speeches — that these interrogation methods are unreliable when it comes to producing actionable information,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. To omit them “would have been a reprehensible act of moral cowardice.” She added: “Ms. Bigelow’s direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It’s pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically nontriumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before — the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals — has led to this.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2013-09-06,Who Made That Catcher’s Mask?,A bird cage for your face.,"In the early 1870s, catchers played bare faced. Balls routinely struck their eyes, broke their noses and knocked out their teeth. The danger increased when catchers, who had stood two dozen feet behind the batter, moved closer to the plate — an innovation, says the baseball historian Peter Morris, “that allowed the top pitchers to throw their best pitches.” The facial injuries finally decreased when a team from Harvard University rigged up a mask to protect its catchers that resembled a sturdy bird cage. The manager of the team, Frederick Thayer, patented the mask in 1878. Fans hated it. When the Harvard catcher James Tyng stepped onto the field with his head swaddled in steel and leather, he endured jeers from the crowd — people hooted at the mad dog who had to be “muzzled.” Editorial writers complained that the innovation detracted from the game. What was next — a lightning rod to save the catcher from freak storms?

2013-09-06,Lives of the Cells,A journalist’s report on what cancer is and how it occurs illuminates deep biological processes.,"Cancer would seem a dreary, frightful topic if it weren’t also such a universal one. In this era of longer human life spans, it’s almost as inevitable as death and ­taxes. Most of us will experience some form of cancer — if not in our own bodies then at close remove, through the suffering of loved ones — and therefore none of us can afford to ignore it. Knowledge is better than ignorant dread, and good writing based on keen reporting is far better than medical jargon, garbled hearsay or misinformation from the Web. That’s just one reason for reading George Johnson’s graceful book, “The Cancer Chronicles.” Another is that the biological details of just what cancer is and how it occurs are (forgive me for saying so) fascinating. And not just fascinating but also, as handled by Johnson, revealing of certain deep truths about life itself. Those truths involve two elemental concepts, familiar (if dimly) from high school biology and physics: mitosis and entropy. More on that fateful pair in a moment.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/books/review/george-johnsons-cancer-chronicles.html

The band’s debut EP, “Agape,” bears out that sentiment. Released last week by the independent label Communion Records, it’s a collection of lyrically sincere and emotionally raw songs. It also reflects the band’s D.I.Y. approach, right down to the hand-carved potato paw prints they stamp every CD with.

A wisp of a thing, barely more than twice the length of this review, it contains little action, less plot. It doesn’t seem to be about anything — except a whole life. We meet the unnamed protagonist as a child clearing ice-cream dishes from the family dinner table, surreptitiously licking the “creamy dregs” from each one. We glimpse her as a teenager necking on the couch, as a young wife reveling in the domestic sensuality of motherhood, as an older woman attending her husband’s deathbed, even then unable to keep from physical contact, “her open lips brushing . . . the surgical tape that secured the respirator in his mouth.” In the end, Alice McDermott’s “Enough” is a portrait of a woman filtered through a sensory lens, capturing the life of the body, replete with exultation and ache.

Steve Rush, Marty Rush, Jake Rush all have a hard-boiled literary glamour. There is even a DJ Rush. But Norman? Only one last name goes with Norman, and that was nabbed by Mailer. Rush couldn’t be more inappropriate; Norman has never been in a. . . . His first book, “Whites,” a story collection, was published in 1986, when he was 53. Between that and “Subtle Bodies” there have been just two novels: a long one, “Mating,” and the even longer “Mortals.” It’s not the frequency of these sturdy ol’ buses so much as their speed that is remarkable, their emphatic rejection of notions of narrative urgency. Walking, to put it oxymoronically, is Rush’s preferred pace. In “Mating” the narrator recounts how she hiked to a utopian village presided over by the enigmatic Denoon, on whom she had developed a high-I.Q. crush. This was not a stroll to Fruitlands in Massachusetts; it was a trek through the Kalahari. She barely made it, almost gave up the ghost. Me too.

Like most journalists covering the disaster, Pargaien dutifully described families who had lost everything, including their modest thatch-roofed homes. Unlike most journalists, Pargaien reported from the scene while perched on the shoulders of a flood victim in the middle of a swollen river. As the outrage poured in, Pargaien tried to explain himself.

R. Martin has never bludgeoned anybody with a battle-ax (as far as I can tell), and Jane Austen probably never met a zombie. But Kathy Reichs — whose mysteries about the forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan sold well even before they were adapted for the Fox television series “Bones” — knows where she’s coming from. Reichs earned her Ph.D. in physical anthropology from Northwestern University in 1975, and among other highlights in her busy career she has consulted with the United Nations on the Rwandan genocide and helped to identify the remains of 9/11 victims in Manhattan.

In “Disabled Theater,” Jérôme Bel collaborates with Theater Hora, a Zurich company — many in the group have Down syndrome — to explore the concept of normality. It’s a risky, haunting work. For Mr. Bel, who has created acclaimed theatrical portraits of dancers like Véronique Doisneau and Cédric Andrieux, “Disabled Theater” extends on his study of people and their bodies. The production is a co-presentation of Performa 13, the latest installment of the performance biennial, and New York Live Arts, where it will be shown starting on Nov. 12. In his daring piece, Mr. Bel questions notions of handicaps and abnormality with his seemingly innocent gaze and understated showmanship.

2013-09-06,The Ad Campaign: Spitzer Attacks Stringer on Term Limits,"Eliot Spitzer started airing the first negative television ad of the campaign for comptroller, saying Scott M. Stringer cut a “back-room deal” to allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term.","With polls suggesting that the Democratic primary for New York City comptroller is a dead heat, Eliot Spitzer has started airing the first negative television ad of the campaign. Titled “Our Voice,” it accuses his rival, Scott M. Stringer, of having cut a “back-room deal” to lift term limits and allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term. The Spitzer campaign also started airing a Spanish-language version of the ad and a similar one on the radio.PRODUCER Siegel StrategiesTHE SCRIPT Voice-over: “Term limits were voted in by the people, until 20-year career politician Scott Stringer worked to destroy them, cutting a back-room deal to hand a third term to the mayor against the people’s will, even testifying before the City Council to get it done. Eliot Spitzer has always fought against the same special interests and back-room politicians supporting Stringer. Because Stringer didn’t only take away our term limits. He took away our voice. But this Sept. 10, we get to use it.”ON SCREEN The music, brassy and solemnly patriotic, sounds ripped from the score of a Western. There are images of Mr. Stringer, including one with Mr. Bloomberg, and a graphic of a piece of paper with “Term Limits” written on it being gradually torn to shreds. A phrase from a Christian Science Monitor article about the term-limits debate (“counter to the will of the voters”) flashes across the screen. As the music shifts to a more hopeful mode, the ad closes with images of Mr. Spitzer shaking hands with voters and patting them on the back, and a close-up on a Hispanic woman and a black man standing next to Mr. Spitzer.ACCURACY Mr. Stringer did testify before the Council in 2008, urging members to vote to extend term limits to 12 years, from 8 years. There is no evidence, however, that he was part of any “back-room deal” to hand Mr. Bloomberg a third term. He endorsed Mr. Bloomberg’s 2009 opponent, William C. Thompson Jr.As to whether Mr. Spitzer fought against “the same special interests and back-room politicians” that support Mr. Stringer, the claim is so broad that it is hard to quantify its measure of truth. If “special interests” refers to the unions that have endorsed Mr. Stringer, Mr. Spitzer was himself endorsed in previous campaigns by some of the same groups. However, as governor he also prominently clashed with one of the unions backing Mr. Stringer, 1199 S.E.I.U., over cuts that he proposed to health care. Mr. Stringer, like most major New York City candidates who are not self-financing, has accepted donations from people working on Wall Street. As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer led investigations into financial industry practices and made many enemies on Wall Street. The former governor is financing his campaign with money from his family’s real estate fortune.SCORECARD Although Mr. Stringer did support lifting term limits to allow Mr. Bloomberg to run for a third term, his role in the debate was minor. To accuse him of being part of a “back-room deal” is misleading. And although Mr. Stringer has been heavily supported by labor, a political action committee that threatened to raise major Wall Street money to back him has fizzled. The ad speaks to the caustic tone the campaign has taken in its final days; soon after this ad began airing on Thursday, the Stringer campaign went up with its own negative ad.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/the-ad-campaign-spitzer-attacks-stringer-on-term-limits/
2013-09-06,The Ad Campaign: Stringer Says Spitzer ‘Held Himself to a Different Standard’,"Hours after Eliot Spitzer attacked him in a television commercial, Scott M. Stringer responded with his own negative spot, invoking the prostitution scandal that forced Mr. Spitzer to resign as governor in 2008.","Hours after Eliot Spitzer started broadcasting the first negative television commercial in the Democratic primary for comptroller, his opponent, Scott M. Stringer, responded with his own negative spot. Titled “Clear Choice,” it invokes the prostitution scandal that led Mr. Spitzer to resign as governor in 2008.PRODUCER GMMBTHE SCRIPT Announcer: “The Times, Post and Daily News all endorse Scott Stringer. He’ll audit every city agency to cut waste so we can invest in jobs and schools. And he far outdistances Eliot Spitzer in integrity. Spitzer jailed people for prostitution and financial crimes, but when he got caught doing the very same thing, he held himself to a different standard, and walked away scot-free. That’s why The Times, Post and Daily News all say the choice is clear: Scott Stringer, comptroller.”ON SCREEN The announcer speaks over what sounds like the upbeat theme music for an evening newscast, while the screen shows images of Mr. Stringer at his desk and talking to a man in a pharmacist’s coat, a flyover picture of City Hall and an image of a school hallway. When the narrator mentions Mr. Spitzer’s putting people in jail, a person is shown from the back in handcuffs. This is followed by black-and-white images of Mr. Spitzer, with the words “Same Crimes” and “Different Standard” and a CNN headline — “Spitzer Won’t Be Charged in Prostitution Scandal” — flashing on the screen. The ad ends with an image of the New York skyline and a photograph of Mr. Stringer on the Brooklyn Bridge.ACCURACY As far as prostitution goes, the ad is accurate. As governor, Mr. Spitzer was caught patronizing prostitutes, precipitating his resignation. The assertion that he committed financial crimes, however, is misleading. In announcing that they would not charge Mr. Spitzer, federal prosecutors said there was “insufficient evident to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to” to the prostitution ring. The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post have all endorsed Mr. Stringer.SCORECARD If Mr. Stringer stuck to reminding voters that Mr. Spitzer patronized prostitutes — something that few have likely forgotten — he would be on solid ground. Bringing in financial crimes stretches the truth and the available evidence.",New York,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/the-ad-campaign-stringer-says-spitzer-held-himself-to-a-different-standard/

2013-09-07,What’s on Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) ARGO  (2012) Ben Affleck, above, directed and stars in this Oscar winner for best film. It covers a little-known chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis in which Antonio J. Mendez, a Central Intelligence Agency officer and wizard of disguise, was tapped to help free six State Department employees stranded in Tehran after revolutionary forces seized the United States Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979. His plan: to have them pose as a Canadian movie crew filming a science-fiction flick called “Argo.” John Goodman and Alan Arkin play the Hollywood makeup artist and producer who assist him in his mission. Bryan Cranston, his neck tendons popping, is one of his bosses; and Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham and Kerry Bishé are the escapees. After setting your pulse racing, Mr. Affleck “smoothly downshifts, easing from the high anxiety of the opener — which evokes 1970s political thrillers like Sydney Pollack’s ‘Three Days of the Condor’ — into something looser, mellower and funny,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Affleck handles his own roles, on camera and behind it, with a noticeable lack of self-aggrandizement,” she added. “In the end, this is a story about outwitting rather than killing the enemy, making it a homage to actual intelligence and an example of the same.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-09-08,Backstage Beauty Report | Stripped-Down Makeup at Alexander Wang,Diane Kendal created a look that had models runway ready in less than five minutes.,"Rarely does a “no-makeup” look truly mean just that. But at the Alexander Wang show this evening, there wasn’t a speck of foundation, eye shadow or lipstick anywhere in sight. “I call it raw beauty,” the makeup artist Diane Kendal said of the barely-there, extreme-minimalist look she created backstage. Proving the point, her routine took all of five minutes: she patted Nars Skin Aqua Gel Luminous Oil-Free Moisturizer on the skin to give it a “nice luminous” quality and dotted stick concealer down the sides of the nose and over any blemishes or redness. Lashes were curled; arches were set with a quick pass of brow gel. And that’s it. “It’s actually hard to tell which models have their makeup done and which don’t,” one observer noted, puzzled. Kendal couldn’t be happier about that. “Alexander loved that the girls looked so cool [when they came in for casting],” she said. “So we agreed that the more you do with makeup, the less cool it looks.” The models seemed to embrace the no-fuss effect. “It’s very au naturel,” Joan Smalls said, adding that “this is the fastest makeup I’ve had done for a show.” Jourdan Dunn called the pared-down approach “laid-back and easy,” while Hanne Gaby Odiele said, “It’s simple but fresh; it’s like how we walked in — but a little less tired.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/backstage-beauty-report-stripped-down-makeup-at-alexander-wang/

2013-09-08,What’s on Sunday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (13) LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX Derek Jacobi, above, and Anne Reid portray Alan and Celia, childhood sweethearts, now both widowed and in their 70s, who fall in love all over again — and begin to lament “what if?” — after being reunited on the Internet nearly 60 years later. Sarah Lancashire and Nicola Walker play the daughters who would be the last people to stand in the way of their parents’ happiness, but who can’t help themselves. “There’s nothing to be gained from saying unkind things about ‘Last Tango in Halifax,’ a warm comforter of a series,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “It’s based on actual, inspiring events in the life of the writer’s mother. And it has been expertly assembled and fine-tuned for maximum heartwarming effect, so those who like this sort of thing will like it very, very much.” But while the show “begins with a potentially interesting situation,” he said, it “proceeds to do little with it.” He added: “A good test of how you’ll respond to this ‘Last Tango’ could be how you responded to the film from which it (hilariously) borrows its title. If the portrait of despair in ‘Last Tango in Paris’ left you shattered but exhilarated, then ‘Last Tango in Halifax’ may not be your cup of tea.” In the season finale of “Silk,” at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, Martha (Maxine Peake) and Clive (Rupert Penry-Jones) have their Queen’s Counsel interviews as she takes on the biggest case in her career — defending a repeat offender charged with murder — while struggling to focus as the stress resulting from her personal life increases.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

Ms. Atwood will tackle “The Tempest,” while Mr. Jacobson has chosen “The Merchant of Venice.” They join Anne Tyler, who will provide her own take on “The Taming of the Shrew,” and Jeanette Winterson, who will reimagine “The Winter’s Tale.” The plays are scheduled to be published in print, digital and audio formats in 2016 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death as part of the Hogarth Shakespeare project. In a news release, Ms. Atwood said that she had selected “The Tempest” because it “has always been a favorite of mine, and working on it will be an invigorating challenge. Is Caliban the first talking monster? Not quite, but close.” Mr. Jacobson also gave his reasons for selecting “The Merchant of Venice”: “For an English novelist, Shakespeare is where it all begins. For an English novelist who also happens to be Jewish, ‘The Merchant of Venice’ is where it all snarls up.” He added: “ ‘Who is the merchant and who is the Jew?’ Portia wanted to know.

2013-09-09,Backstage Beauty Report | Seashell-Like Updos at Carolina Herrera,Clean lines and flawless execution were key for this hairstyle by Orlando Pita.,"“I especially like structured, architectural updos — and not many people let you do that,” the hair wiz Orlando Pita said at the Carolina Herrera show earlier today. Herrera, though, is just the kind of designer who appreciates classic, clean lines, which Pita played up in the sleek, tightly coiled updos seen on her runway. “The shape was inspired by a long seashell with a swirl at the top,” he said. To achieve the effect, he brushed strands straight and generously misted on By Byron Spirulina Hair Spray for grip. Hair was then parted off to the side and divided into two sections at the back, each of which was rolled in toward the scalp, leaving a loop at the top, and pinned in place. “I need it tighter here,” Pita said, cupping the base of a model’s updo and ordering a redo. (Fact: even the pros don’t nail things on the first attempt.) The finished result was entirely right for the Herrera woman. “This isn’t a jeans-and-a-jacket kind of look — it’s cocktails and an event,” Pita noted, as the delicate clouds of hair spray settled around him.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/backstage-beauty-report-seashell-like-updos-at-carolina-herrera/

But Billie Jean King, above, was all about girl power, crusading for gender equality on the court and off. And in 1973 — a year in which “Ms.” was added to the United States government’s list of acceptable courtesy titles, and the Supreme Court legalized abortion — she faced Bobby Riggs in the so-called Battle of the Sexes and won. “When he jumped over the net, his first thing he said to me was, ‘I underestimated you,’ ” she recalled. He was perhaps the only one. Ms. King won 39 Grand Slam titles and a record 20 at Wimbledon; founded the Women’s Tennis Association in 1973; became the country’s first openly lesbian major sports figure in 1981; and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama in 2009 for championing the rights of women and gay people. In its first profile of a sports figure, “American Masters” recounts the hard-hitting times of Ms. King, 69, whom many consider the most important female athlete of the 20th century.

They’re good questions! But they aren’t questions that will prevent this strange “peace” plan from going forward, because at this point the Obama White House doesn’t really have any option except to play the card that Vladimir Putin just dealt. A congressional resolution authorizing strikes was on life support even without the Russian option; with the Russian option on the table, the resolution is as dead as a doornail buried six feet under in the local cemetery, and the potential humiliation the administration was facing a few days ago would become a certainty if they decided to turn to the offer down outright.

Internally, however, there are certain areas where we haven’t pushed the envelope, and when it comes to the development environment we use to build our website, we have been behind for a while. When I started at The Times, our dev environment was a combination of mounted file systems from remote servers mixed with a poorly organized Subversion repository that was extremely difficult to work with.

2013-09-10,Why Roger Federer Is the Greatest of All Time,"Yes, he has a lousy record against Nadal. But he’s displayed a consistency and durability at a time when the competition is deeper than it has ever been.","Roger Federer, who I wrote about in the magazine’s U.S. Open issue, was the big story coming into the Open; the state of his game dominated the conversation for most of the tournament. But the big story coming out of the Open is his longtime nemesis, Rafael Nadal, who won the men’s title last night with an enthralling four-set victory over the world No. 1, Novak Djokovic. The win gives the 27-year-old Spaniard his 13th grand-slam singles title at exactly the same age that Federer won his 13th, which leaves the whole GOAT debate even more unsettled. GOAT? That’s short for greatest of all time and is an acronym that has been tossed around promiscuously during the Federer years. With a record 17 majors highlighting his numerous career achievements, Federer has staked a strong claim to GOAT status. But he has a losing record against Nadal, and a lopsided one at that. The two have played 31 times since 2004, and Nadal has won 21 of those matches. Federer’s record against Nadal is a large blot on an otherwise remarkable résumé. How can you be considered the greatest player ever if you were arguably not even the best player of your own era? When I spoke with Federer at Wimbledon, he didn’t object when I noted that some feel that Nadal ought to be regarded as the finest male player of all time. “I believe we’ll never quite know,” Federer told me.",Magazine,https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/why-roger-federer-is-the-greatest-of-all-time/

While male models have had success in other fields (Mario Sorrenti is a top fashion photographer, and Magnus Berger is a creative director at WSJ Magazine), few have made the jump from runway to design studio.

It can be seen in “Napoleone Martinuzzi: Venini 1925-1931,” an exhibition through Dec. 1 at Le Stanze del Vetro on San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. A show theme is the friendship between Mr. Martinuzzi and the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio, who commissioned intensely colorful, intricate works, like a pumpkin made of layered glass. “Martinuzzi brought the tradition of Murano glass into the modern era,” said the show’s curator, Marino Barovier, and his work is “rich in energy and saturated with a surprisingly contemporary taste.” Closed Wednesdays. 011-39-041-5229138 or lestanzedelvetro.it.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/garden/the-champagne-of-venetian-glass.html

Thirty years later, they set out to create new ones, which are produced with techniques the men feared were dying out. All of their rugs are handmade with silk and wool from their own silkworms and sheep. The yarn is handspun, bathed in natural vegetable dyes, rinsed in streams and dried in the sun. Mr. Shabahang, a trained architect from a family that has made rugs for 400 years, creates all the designs. The latest collection, which was woven in Turkey, includes Printemps, shown above at right, inspired by a piece of Art Deco stained glass (4 feet 2 inches by 6 feet 2 inches; $5,500), and Adrift, inspired by a bird’s-eye view of lilypads in a pond (3 by 5 feet; $3,400).

(Reader, don’t be dismayed: there are those accouterments, too.) Ms. Rockefeller, the youngest of David and Peggy Rockefeller’s six children, and a great-granddaughter of John D., grew up between a town house in Manhattan, a farm in Tarrytown, N.Y., a house in St. Barts and another in Maine, and struggled with shyness and undiagnosed dyslexia. Yet the star of the memoir may be Ms. Rockefeller’s mother, Peggy, who battled depression and the exigencies of her role as a Rockefeller wife with an antic wit and a passion for rural life, both of which qualities she worked hard to instill in her children. After Peggy bought a 20-acre island in Maine for $300 from a lobsterman (private island alert), she and her three youngest children built a cabin there by themselves, along with an outhouse, stone wall and vegetable garden.",Home & Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/garden/a-rockefeller-who-prefers-a-rustic-life.html

To achieve the necessary oomph, the makeup artist Dick Page slicked on a rich berry lipstick, called Dame, from Kors’s new 18-piece makeup collection. “It’s a color that’s not an obvious color, and that’s what makes it work on so many different complexions,” the designer said of the shade worn by his entire cast of models, including Karolina Kurkova, Joan Smalls and Liu Wen. Page applied the hue, blotted it, and then set it by brushing powder onto one layer of tissue that had been pressed to the lips to “diffuse the color and pull it out of focus,” he explained. The finishing touch? Bronzer. “I’m bronzer obsessed!” Kors admitted, which explains the generously sized compacts of his label’s Sporty Bronze Powder used backstage (“If I had a horse who needed bronzing, there’s enough product in here!” quipped Page). It all came together to create a relaxed, just-back-from-holiday look, which the model Karmen Pedaru easily channeled: she was spotted sitting outside, soaking up a bit of sun, moments before opening the show.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/backstage-beauty-report-berry-lips-and-no-shortage-of-bronzer-at-michael-kors/

Questions had been raised about why the explosion had been so devastating, given the relatively low volatility of most crude oil.

Chait does a fine job of capturing the essential elements of Bloombergism, from the authoritarian governing style to the distinctive “pink police state” approach to social policy (sexual freedom and bike lanes for me, stop and frisk and soda bans for thee), and he cuts to the heart of why Bloomberg’s overall agenda wasn’t really perfectly calibrated to the median voter’s allegedly post-partisan desires, as so many of the mayor’s Acela Corridor fans wanted to believe:",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/looking-for-the-anti-bloomberg/
2013-09-12,All the Rage | Men’s Wear Collections for Speed Racers and Getaway Guys,"It’s almost as though the movie “Drive” influenced spring runways, from the venues to the clothes.","In a welcome contrast to the bare-bones runways that have set the scene for most women’s shows during New York Fashion Week, men’s wear designers have played up the masculine, visual references. From the venues to the clothes, it’s almost as though “Drive,” the 2011 visual thriller starring Ryan Gosling, influenced it all. General Idea presented its sleek separates inside the Classic Car Club, where models walked in front of a pair of antique roadsters that set the tone for the label’s mesh and reflective jackets. Tim Coppens took his collection to the track, outfitting his crew — whose members carried racing helmets as the accessory du jour — in long and short sleeveless jumpsuits and classic racing leathers. Backstage at Siki Im, models dressed amid parked cars before the show began inside an old garage. Opening Ceremony showed both men’s and women’s looks in its very first runway, but the setting and presentation was decidedly masculine: an army of models flooded the vast space at the SuperPier, all at once, chauffeured by a stream of shiny cars. And the satin bomber jackets, like the one Gosling wears in “Drive,” were in no short supply either. Bespoken, J. Crew, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Porsche Design all showed metallic and satin versions of the short zip-front blouson, many with models wearing expression-concealing shades like Gosling’s deadpan character.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/all-the-rage-mens-wear-collections-for-speed-racers-and-getaway-guys/

On the one hand, his poetry of paranoia and his grasp of history’s surrealist passages make a perfect fit. Yet his slippery insouciance, his relentless japery, risk being tonally at odds with the subject. Either way, and despite his sensibility’s entrenchment in ’60s Californian hippiedom, Pynchon is a New Yorker, with an intimate license to depict the sulfurous gray plumes and tragic tableaus of that irreconcilable moment: “On the way home she passes the neighborhood firehouse. They’re in working on one of the trucks. . . . She threads among the daily bunches of flowers on the sidewalk, which will be cleared in a while. The list of firefighters here who were lost on 11 September is kept back someplace more intimate, out of the public face, anybody wants to see it they can ask, but sometimes it shows more respect not to put such things out on a billboard. . . .

To achieve the effect, artists traced around the perimeters of eyes with either a green pencil (Nars Eyeliner Pencil in Kalisté) or cobalt liner (Nars Blue Dahlia Larger Than Life Eyeliner; available in November), extending their ultra-fine strokes just beyond the inner and outer corners to provide graphic impact. Smudges and smears were cleaned up with a simple cotton swab while an eyebrow comb was used to sweep away any fallen particles from skin. “Marc loves when I do eyes,” Nars said of the feature he’s most known for enhancing, which often anchors the designer’s beauty look. The model Cara Delevingne was eager to try things out as she sat in the makeup chair. “I love a colored eye,” she said, pushing her tousled hair off her face. “It just adds a touch of something.” Her backstage cohort, Georgia May Jagger, concurred, saying: “People can get quite boring, so it’s good to add something different.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/backstage-beauty-the-eyes-have-it-at-marc-jacobs/

2013-09-15,What’s on Sunday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (13, 49) FOYLE’S WAR, SERIES VII: THE ETERNITY RING This “Masterpiece Mystery!” stalwart, starring Michael Kitchen as the tenacious detective Christopher Foyle and on hiatus since 2010, picks up in 1946, when one war has ended and a new one looms as the Iron Curtain falls across Europe. Foyle, now retired, has been recruited by the British intelligence agency MI5 and must investigate the possibility of a Soviet spy network in the heart of London. In the process he learns that his former driver, Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks, above, speaking to Mr. Kitchen), has been working for one of the suspects. “As a quiet man who makes a religion of honor, responsibility and competence, Mr. Kitchen gives a performance that is, by current standards, miraculously understated,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. And though the series has advanced chronologically by only a year, “it’s a different world,” he said. “This grayer, chillier ‘Foyle’s War’ may not suit everyone, but it’s admirable, and a bit remarkable,” that its creator and writer Anthony Horowitz “has moved the show forward in a way that makes historical and dramatic sense. It wouldn’t work, of course, if Mr. Kitchen did not remain at the center, communicating an entire worldview in the way he says ‘Oh, I see’ or tells a weaselly major, ‘I’ve come to give you another opportunity to tell me the truth.’ ” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

Here, she remembers her good friend Julia Child and early days at Le Cordon Bleu.","Anne Willan found her footing in the male-dominated world of French cuisine long before female chefs became commonplace. Raised in Yorkshire, England, she studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris before going on to cook for American socialites, British royalty and French artists, also working as an editor at Gourmet magazine and the Washington Star. In 1975, backed by Sofitel, her dear friend Julia Child and James Beard, she founded the Parisian cooking school La Varenne, where she played a major role in the popularization of French cuisine. In May, she was inducted into the James Beard Foundation’s Cookbook Hall of Fame for her “body of work,” which includes 40 cookbooks and a 26-part PBS program. Now, she shares her adventures in life, love and cheese balls in the delectable memoir “One Soufflé at a Time” (St. Martin’s Press, $28), which also comes peppered with her favorite recipes. Here, Willan remembers her early days and talks about how the food world has changed.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/q-a-the-french-culinary-legend-anne-willan-dishes-on-the-changing-food-landscape/

In the “after” photo, a virile gentleman sports a handlebar mustache, smokes a cigar and wears a “bachelor undershirt” stretchy enough to be pulled over the head. “No safety pins — no buttons — no needle — no thread,” ran the slogan aimed at men with no wives and no sewing skills.

He has written four works of fiction — two novels and two story collections — all composed of canny snippets that build with subtle accumulative power to create books autobiographical in feel, if not necessarily in fact. In all but his first novel, “The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo,” the books return to the same characters from startling vantage points; Orner is writing in spirals, moving restlessly out to embody imagined characters, but always returning to the Chicago and Fall River, Mass., family of his most frequent first-person narrator, a young man who is roughly his age. In each of his books, Orner’s crystalline sentences and his ability to pay close and sustained attention to small moments transform the ordinary elements of each story into an even more astonishing whole.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/peter-orners-last-car-over-the-sagamore-bridge.html

The Harlem Renaissance has been well documented by its poets, novelists and essayists, as well as by a legion of scholars in the decades since. The long, depressing ghetto years were recounted most eloquently by James Baldwin, and by lesser mortals like sociologists, memoirists, politicians, Hollywood screenwriters and rappers. Today’s whiter Harlem of multimillion-­dollar brownstones and flashy eateries is already the subject of books, blogs and innumerable magazine travel articles.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/harlem-nocturne-by-farah-jasmine-griffin.html

Some, constrained by social expectations, effaced the records of their work. Others made it difficult for historians to treat them with much seriousness.

2013-09-20,The Unquiet Americans,Bob Shacochis’s novel of conflict and corruption spans five decades and four countries.,"Like most serious American novels about war, “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul” wants to explain the country in its entirety. Of course, that’s a tall order, but Bob Shacochis doesn’t lack for ambition — his novel is about not one but two contemporary wars, both of them endless: the war on terror and the war on drugs. It’s a novel about the United States that takes place largely outside the United States, if you discount the many scenes set on various world-renowned American golf courses. Although the book strives to paint a full portrait of its panoply of complicated characters — both in warrior mode and on the home front — the problem with endless war in a narrative is that the writer ends up not with “War and Peace” but with war and . . . more war. One follows from battle to battle, from firefight to firefight, from political assassination to terror attack to revenge-taking, without resolution, because the endless war can conceive of no resolution: resolution, which makes a narrative complete, is not part of this story.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/bob-shacochiss-woman-who-lost-her-soul.html

It’s still the materialistic 1980s in W IS FOR WASTED (Marian Wood/Putnam, $28.95), so Kinsey Millhone, the well-nigh immortal sleuth in this enduring series, still has time to play her rebel role simply by living a spartan existence in a world of greedy narcissists. How sweet it is to see the California private eye back in her garage apartment, hanging out with her 88-year-old landlord, wearing jeans and boots and pulling out a single dress to get her through formal occasions. It’s also fun to watch her at work, taking notes on index cards, typing reports on a Smith-Corona and — here’s what really matters — communicating with people face to face.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/sue-graftons-w-is-for-wasted-and-more.html
2013-09-20,Her Story,The woman raped by Roman Polanski when she was 13 tells what happened then and in the long aftermath.,"Samantha Geimer says she really wants you to leave her alone. Really. She’s a 50-year-old woman now, dividing her time between Hawaii and Nevada with her husband and three sons. But 36 years ago in Hollywood, when she was only 13, she was plied with Champagne and a quaa­lude, photographed topless, and raped by the 43-year-old Roman Polanski. And ever since, her privacy has been busted. Any time Polanski is in the news, Geimer is once again thrown back into reliving her invaded girlhood, an unwilling principal player in a story never satisfactorily concluded. And Polanski is in the news often, since the artistically impressive, Oscar-winning, Polish-French director who made “Chinatown,” “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Pianist” fled the United States in 1978 before final sentencing. The wrath of American justice, affronted as much by his defiance as by his crime, awaits him if he ever returns. It’s a story that has become grimy with symbolism about Hollywood privilege, 1970s California indulgence, imperfect parenting, judicial pandering and inconsistency, tortured creative temperament, and the rights of rape victims.

As she writes in typically winking fashion after a grueling bout of online Mormon dating: “If the kind of man I want exists within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he is rare, not unlike the endangered red panda of the Himalayas. Show me an LDS man who’s wickedly funny, politically liberal, brighter than the average bear and uncommitted to 1950s gender roles, and I will show you the shaggy tail and waddling gait of the Ailurus fulgens, its mischievous mouth rife with bamboo.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/nicole-hardys-confessions-of-a-latter-day-virgin.html

2013-09-21,What’s On Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) HITCHCOCK (2012) Anthony Hopkins, buried in a fat suit and facial prosthetics, summons the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock during the making of “Psycho” in this biopic, directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on a book by Stephen Rebello. But Hitchcock isn’t merely taken with the inspiration behind his perverse shocker: Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel about the crimes of Ed Gein, a serial killer in Wisconsin who adorned his home with human body parts and walked around in the skin of his female victims. Hitchcock becomes possessed, enduring sleepless nights and, at the same time, marital troubles with his wife and adviser, Alma (Helen Mirren, above with Mr. Hopkins), who is dramatically unhappy about his fixation on blondes — in this case, Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). “The real Hitchcock’s great flaw, apparently, was that he was at once a genius and a private man, a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while “The Girl,” on HBO, “painted him as a pathetic sexual predator,” this film “takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director,” she said. “It’s fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

Unfortunately, the world doesn’t seem inclined to do much, and most of the trends are bad. I think there’s a good chance that this war will continue for years to come, will claim hundreds of thousands of lives, will lead to the toppling of King Abdullah’s government in Jordan, and will result in an extension of the fighting in Lebanon and Iraq. In other words, we’re on course toward a catastrophe. ",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/reader-comments-on-my-column-about-the-boy-who-defied-the-syrian-regime/

For what looked like a less extreme version of the all-pink eyes on the runway earlier this season at Burberry, Pecheux first covered eyelids with a soft veil of pearl white eyeshadow, then added a peach tone near the lashes.

About $7.9 billion from donors went to poor and middle-income countries last year. The amount has grown slowly after inflation for the past four years. Spending soared from 2002 to 2008 with the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and the Bush administration’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The United States contributes almost 64 percent of the money. Britain gives 10 percent, France 5 percent, Germany 4 percent and Japan 3 percent. Measured as a percentage of gross national product, Denmark is the largest donor. Speeding up the disbursement of previously approved money increased the American contribution in 2012 to $5 billion from $4.5 billion.

(Some of which are ongoing on the Senate floor at the moment.) The others in that group — Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio — have tried to initiate real policy debates and shift the party’s stance on major issues: Rubio with immigration, Paul (and Lee) with foreign policy and civil liberties, Paul with drug policy and criminal justice, and now Lee with family policy and tax reform. But not Cruz: He’s defining himself as a national figure not by taking positions on questions that divide his party, but by picking issues where the party is basically united — Obamacare, gun control, taxes — and playing the maximalist while promising the moon. (Tellingly, on the specific fronts where the others have staked out some legitimately bold stances, the Texas senator has mostly tap-danced — he’s “somewhere between Rand Paul and John McCain” on foreign policy, somewhere in the middle of his party on immigration, and so on.) Paul, Rubio and now Lee are all trying to move the party, and conservatism, in a particular direction; Cruz is telling conservatives to fight harder, but otherwise to stay exactly where they are.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-ambitions-of-ted-cruz/

In the subsequent decade, his overproduction of the image in two and three dimensions, including his design for a 1973 United States postage stamp, eventually ruined his reputation in the serious New York art world.

If we wanted a secondary source to explain life’s existence, the professor said, we were free to spend extracurricular angst reconciling those conflicting reports.

By “superior” I believe he meant “uncommonly patient.” Plants do everything animals do, but slowly. They migrate, communicate, deceive, stalk their food and, with an ostentation of styles and perfumes to put the animal kingdom to shame, they make love.

The cap, which is the median of what managers estimate it caught over the past five years, will be implemented by zone and gear type. River herring and shad, whose populations are at historic lows, spend part of their lives at sea and run up rivers to spawn; hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on dam removal projects to foster a revival of the runs, but fishermen and conservationists have long warned the species also need protection at sea. The council also discussed the National Marine Fisheries Service’s decision this summer not to implement all of the measures the council approved last year to protect Atlantic herring, citing funding issues; the group tabled a motion to prohibit midwater trawling in the region until those rules are put into place.

Carleton Gajdusek won a Nobel Prize for identifying a fatal disease in a remote tribe in Papua New Guinea. By the time of his death in 2008, Gajdusek had achieved another kind of notoriety, having been imprisoned for sexually abusing one of the dozens of native children he had adopted. Hanya Yanagihara’s suspenseful first novel, “The People in the Trees,” is based loosely on this true story, with a number of horrifying twists. From the start, she sets her narrative dial to creepy, and challenges to the extreme the notion that a protagonist needs to be “likable.” Yet thanks to her rich, masterly prose, it’s hard to turn away from Dr. Norton Perina, her antihero inspired by Gajdusek.

Curators opened up the museum’s specimen storage rooms and lent artifacts, like beaded Native American dresses from the Blackfoot tribe, to design firms and department stores for inspiration.

2013-09-28,What’s On Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Showtime) LINCOLN (2012) Daniel Day-Lewis, below, in the role that won him his third Oscar for best actor, portrays Abraham Lincoln as he struggles to abolish slavery while the Civil War rages in this drama directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, his wife, who is grieving the death of their son Willie; Tommy Lee Jones is the abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, who, along with his fellow Republican radicals, is demanding a vote on a Constitutional amendment; Hal Holbrook is Preston Blair, a party conservative who prefers peace talks with the Confederacy that evade a decisive solution. And David Strathairn is William Seward, Lincoln’s secretary of state, who is willing to trade patronage jobs for votes in Congress. “The genius of ‘Lincoln,’ finally, lies in its vision of politics as a noble, sometimes clumsy dialectic of the exalted and the mundane,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Our habit of argument, someone said recently, is a mark of our liberty, and Mr. Kushner, whose love of passionate, exhaustive disputation is unmatched in the modern theater, fills nearly every scene with wonderful, maddening talk. Mr. Spielberg’s best art often emerges in passages of wordlessness, when the images speak for themselves, and the way he composes his pictures and cuts between them endows the speeches and debates with emotional force, and reminds us of what is at stake.” “Lincoln,” he added, “is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece — an omen, perhaps, that movies for the people shall not perish from the earth.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-09-28,The Progress Against Global Poverty,Readers comment on my column about the remarkable progress against global poverty and disease.,"My Sunday column looks at something that has been happening over time so that we haven’t given it the attention it deserves–even though it may be the most important thing going on in history right now. I’m referring to the decline of extreme poverty. When I was in college, a majority of the world’s people lived in extreme poverty, and the proportion will have dropped to virtually zero by the time I retire. That’s astounding progress, and it’s also reflected in mortality rates. When I was in college, around 15 million kids a year were dying annually. Now the figure has dropped to a bit more than 6 million, and in my lifetime the figure will drop below 1 million. Illiteracy is also on its way out. Look, we will still face immense problems — the US is a good example of how even a rich country can have a severe problem with an impoverished underclass — and some kinds of poverty will be with us for decades or centuries to come. But the kind I’ve reported on in so many places, where illiterate parents have eight children who die young and are always on the edge of famine or disability, that kind of extreme poverty may be on its way out, along with river blindness, malaria, trachoma and other ailments.",Opinion,https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/the-progress-against-global-poverty/

Pat McGrath kept the face nude and dewy — adding that dewy is the new matte — and focused on a “strong, boyish brow,” using a variety of brow pencils and powders. “We’re making the brows darker, filling them in,” she said. “We’re taking out the arches.” To experiment with a strong brow off the runway, she recommended using products only one or two shades darker than one’s natural brow color. The hairstyle, which Luigi Murenu created and described as “a bit masculine in the front,” also erred on the side of slightly subversive. The heightened roots were shellacked back into rockabilly stiffness, while the length of the hair was flat-ironed stick straight. Murenu summed it up as “a street look but more glamorized. It’s cool, it’s punky” — not unlike the collection. ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/backstage-beauty-report-punk-appeal-at-viktor-rolf/

2013-09-29,What’s On Sunday,Television highlights.,"10 P.M. (Showtime) MASTERS OF SEX Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan star as Dr. William H. Masters and his collaborator, Virginia Johnson, the groundbreaking researchers who sought to demystify arousal during the dark ages before the sexual revolution, in this new series based on Thomas Maier’s biography “Masters of Sex.” He was a brilliant, obsessed and often imperious surgeon determined to make his name by decoding the physiology of pleasure. She was a former nightclub singer and sexually liberated woman with a desire for a career and a deft touch with people. Together they spent thousands of hours watching others masturbate and copulate while wired to monitors. They also had lots of sex with each other, though Johnson told Mr. Maier that at first she didn’t want Masters — she wanted a job. Eventually, Masters left his wife to marry Johnson; they, too, later divorced. Though it takes liberties with facts and interpretation, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times, the show “does an elegant job of reframing their strange, complicated and at times deeply cynical partnership into a twisted but intriguing love story.” It’s enjoyable, she said, “mainly because the actors are so good. Michael Sheen (above, with Nicholle Tom), who is best known for playing likable charmers like Tony Blair and David Frost, is convincing as a driven and stilted egotist, a man who has compassion for patients and almost no time for his infertile, unhappy wife, Libby (Caitlin FitzGerald). As Virginia, a twice-divorced single mother of two, Lizzy Caplan (‘Party Down,’ ‘Bachelorette’) is dazzling in a role that isn’t easy: Virginia is sensual and sexy, strong-willed and good-humored, a modern woman trying to forge her own way in a world that is still backward about sex and the role of women.” And, like sex, Ms. Stanley added, “ ‘Masters of Sex’ gets better as it goes on.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/arts/television/whats-on-sunday.html

Always look towards the end of the eyebrow to give you direction. Then start the line again at the very inner corner, and bring it to the center to meet.

But Sunday’s punt was not down the middle of the field. It was high, far and caught on the numbers by McCluster, not too far from the right sideline. “I’ve got to try to get it closer to the sideline,” Weatherford said. “All things considered, it wasn’t a perfect punt, but it wasn’t a bad punt.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/sports/football/giants-close-up.html
