2015-01-01,How the Civil War Created College Football,Veterans of the conflict saw the gridiron as a perfect training ground for soldier-scholars.,"At a ceremony in Cambridge, Mass., on June 10, 1890, the philanthropist Henry Lee Higginson declared, “I ask to make [Soldiers Field] a memorial to some dear friends who gave their lives … to their country and to their fellow men in the hour of great need — the War of the Rebellion.” The 31 acres of marshlands and pasture that Higginson donated to Harvard College, his alma mater, would serve as the site of the country’s oldest concrete football arena, Harvard Stadium, built over a decade later in 1903. As he memorialized the Civil War dead, the Union veteran addressed a group of 400 male students and alumni, most of whom were too young to have experienced and learned from the horrors of battle during the nation’s bloodiest war. Like Higginson, however, many late-19th-century Americans saw a deep connection between the battlefield and the athletic field, believing that collegiate athletics, including football, could teach the next generation their “own duties as men and citizens of the Republic” and train them to manage “the burden of carrying on this country in the best way.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/how-the-civil-war-created-college-football/

(“I believe in journalism,” he told the National Press Club in 1998. “I believe deeply in journalism.” Apparently he still does; his latest venture is a partnership with The Times’s former executive editor Jill Abramson to promote articles too long for a magazine and too short for a book.) But Brill also has personal experience with the best-seller list: In 1978 he hit the nonfiction list with his first book, “The Teamsters” — “the whole squalid story meticulously researched,” according to the Book Review back then — while in 2011 he spent a few weeks on the extended list with “Class Warfare,” a look at education in America. Reviewing Grisham’s novel, Brill had some kind words for its political observations, although he didn’t think much of what he called “Grishamstyle”: “At times,” he wrote, “his weakness with words is painful to watch, . . . as if someone new to English decided to mimic ‘The Bonfire of the Vanities.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Well, not really. His name isn’t Henry, it’s Jens, and he isn’t a high school guidance counselor, he’s a Danish cartoonist on the run from terrorists. But he’s not one of the Danish cartoonists you’re thinking of, the ones who satirized the Muslim world with their representations of Muhammad. Rather, he’s a different Danish cartoonist, one who drew a cartoon about the other cartoonists, and whose cartoonist cartoon proves to be just as controversial as the original cartoonists’ cartoons. Anyway, for the purposes of this paragraph, let’s just say he’s a high school guidance counselor in Broomeville, N.Y., a cold and isolated upstate town. Although, really, he’s one of two guidance counselors there. The first one has been fired for being a drunk, but actually she’s been fired so that the principal of the school, Matty, who is sort of the protagonist — well, wait, he’s not really the protagonist, per se, he’s one of several people who function, at various times, as protagonists — but as I was saying, Matty has fired the original guidance counselor in order to do a favor for his ex-lover, the wildlife researcher, which is to hire Henry, who is actually Jens. Because the ex-lover, whose name is Locs but really it’s Lorraine, isn’t a wildlife researcher anymore, she’s a C.I.A. agent. And she is trying to protect the cartoonist-of-cartoonists-cum-guidance-counselor by hiding him in Broomeville from the terrorists, who are actually, it turns out, just this one guy, who, it also turns out, is not really a terrorist. But, it further turns out, she’s just trying to find a way to get Matty (whom she calls Matthew) back, though she never really had him in the first place.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/the-happiest-people-in-the-world-by-brock-clarke.html
2015-01-02,"‘A Tale of Two Plantations,’ by Richard S. Dunn",The lives and experiences of three generations of slaves on a Caribbean sugar estate and a Southern plantation.,"For enslaved peoples in the New World, it was always the worst of times. Whether captured in Africa or born into bondage in the Americas, slaves suffered unimaginable torments and indignities. Yet the specific form their miseries took, as the historian Richard S. Dunn shows in his painstakingly researched “A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia,” depended on whether one was a slave in the British Caribbean or in the United States. The contrasts between the two slave societies were many, covering family life, religious beliefs and labor practices. But one difference overrode all others. In the Caribbean, white masters treated the slaves like “disposable cogs in a machine,” working them to death on sugar plantations and then replacing them with fresh stock from Africa. In the United States, white masters treated their slaves like the machine itself — a breeding machine.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/a-tale-of-two-plantations-by-richard-s-dunn.html

In this regard Jane Gardam has been more than accommodating. After American readers began to embrace the British writer’s novel “Old Filth,” released here in 2006, they learned that Gardam had been publishing fine fiction regularly since the 1970s.

Each story traces a different journey, with passengers that include three Russians on their way to a new luxury spa; a Roman Catholic priest and his acolyte pursuing a kind of detective mission; a Czech couple who share a walk on a beach with a night watchman whose entire family perished, along with more than 30,000 other Sri Lankans, in the 2004 tsunami; a delegation of Chinese businessmen appraising vast “junk fields” of military scrap; and a Sri Lankan general (also a renowned ballroom dancer) en route to a meeting with a woman whose family he has all but destroyed. The 14 stories in “Noontide Toll” function like the stages of a tour through a place that’s trying to emerge from the ruins, yet is still “trapped by the past despite the prospects ahead.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/noontide-toll-by-romesh-gunesekera.html

2015-01-04,1940: British Shipping to Be Operated by Government,Highlights from the International Herald Tribune archives: Britain announced it would take control of British and colonial shipping in 1940.,"LONDON — The government will take over full control of British and colonial shipping beginning February 1 to obtain more tonnage for national use, the Ministry of Shipping announced tonight [Jan. 4]. All ships of United Kingdom and colonial registry, with the exception of vessels of Indian and Burman registry, will be taken over when they discharge their first cargo in Great Britain after that date. The scheme, identical to the one employed successfully during the World War, will make it possible to operate ships more efficiently and economically because of the community of interests of the British Dominions, it was explained. Such a control system, it was stated, will result in a regular execution of the shipping program for the efficient conduct of the war. The companies will continue to manage and operate their ships as though carrying on their own business but will receive instructions as to the cargoes to be carried and the routes to be followed. They will maintain their organizations in Britain and abroad but will keep an account of costs for the Ministry.

Upstairs, Lord Grantham stews about the first Labour Government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and what he perceives as its anti-aristocracy stance. Downstairs, the servants think that someone in charge might finally understand the concept of hard work. Lady Edith, meanwhile, turns to the tenant farmer Mr. Drewe and his unsuspecting wife to secret away Marigold, her illegitimate daughter with her married lover, Michael Gregson, still missing in Germany. Lady Mary finds herself inundated by dashing suitors. And when the committee in charge of creating a World War I memorial comes knocking, it isn’t Lord Grantham they want, but rather Mr. Carson, the butler. In “The Manners of Downton Abbey,” at 10:15, Alastair Bruce, an expert on royal ceremony and custom who serves as the show’s historical adviser, discusses the code of conduct that governed Britain in the early 20th century and how he goes about tutoring the actors in speaking, sitting, dressing and keeping an appropriately stiff upper lip.

(Showtime) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric, above at right with Max von Sydow; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. “The phrase ‘triumph of the human spirit’ hovers over ‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,’ along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind” — among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration — Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) “Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual,” he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with “imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

RIPLEY (1999) Starting with the loan of a jacket with a Princeton insignia, Tom Ripley, a New York men’s room attendant played by Matt Damon, begins his ascent of the social ladder — then murders his way up the rest of the rungs — in Anthony Minghella’s adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith thriller. Jude Law (above right, with Mr. Damon, center, and Rosario Fiorello) is Dickie Greenleaf, the scion of a rich American family, whose father has hired Tom to bring him back to the United States from Italy; Gwyneth Paltrow is Marge, who must share Dickie’s affections with his new friend. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is Freddie, who isn’t buying Tom’s act. Writing in The New York Times, Janet Maslin said the film “offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/arts/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Among several good recent examples are Jen Bryant and Melissa Sweet’s “The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus” and Jeanette Winter’s “Mr. Cornell’s Dream Boxes.” Both found a whimsical, child-friendly charm in the eccentricities of subjects few would have called ideal picture-book material: the neurotic Victorian Peter Mark Roget, who came up with the idea for the thesaurus, and the reclusive avant-garde artist Joseph Cornell, who innovated with assemblage. Two new ones are particularly welcome additions to the genre, for both their beautiful illustrations and their stirring stories: Each takes up the life of a 20th-century artist whose accomplishments are no doubt too rarefied to be already familiar to the average elementary schooler; but the subjects’ experiences growing up African-American in the segregated South, then making their ways through civil-rights-era America, give a natural storybook feel to their life trajectories.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/books/review/draw-what-you-see-and-leontyne-price.html

2015-01-07,Among the Disrupted,Leon Wieseltier on the state of culture in the digital age.,"Amid the bacchanal of disruption, let us pause to honor the disrupted. The streets of American cities are haunted by the ghosts of bookstores and record stores, which have been destroyed by the greatest thugs in the history of the culture industry. Writers hover between a decent poverty and an indecent one; they are expected to render the fruits of their labors for little and even for nothing, and all the miracles of electronic dissemination somehow do not suffice for compensation, either of the fiscal or the spiritual kind. Everybody talks frantically about media, a second-order subject if ever there was one, as content disappears into “content.” What does the understanding of media contribute to the understanding of life? Journalistic institutions slowly transform themselves into silent sweatshops in which words cannot wait for thoughts, and first responses are promoted into best responses, and patience is a professional liability. As the frequency of expression grows, the force of expression diminishes: Digital expectations of alacrity and terseness confer the highest prestige upon the twittering cacophony of one-liners and promotional announcements. It was always the case that all things must pass, but this is ridiculous.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/books/review/among-the-disrupted.html

Animal rights groups have long condemned foie gras, which has traditionally been produced by force-feeding ducks and geese, as inhumane. Many chefs across the state, who had lamented the loss of a favored ingredient, were elated by the ruling. “The person who buys our foie gras called us from the courthouse crying with happiness,” said Jon Shook, one of the chef-owners of Animal in Los Angeles. The judge ruled the ban unconstitutional because it attempted to override existing federal law regulating poultry products. The state can appeal the decision, and animal rights groups warned that restaurants that serve it could face protests. “Foie gras is French for ‘fatty liver,’ and ‘fathead’ is the American word for the shameless chefs who actually need a law to make them stop serving the swollen, near-bursting organ of a cruelly force-fed bird,” Ingrid E.

(Showtime) FINDING VIVIAN MAIER (2014) In 2007, John Maloof bought a box of negatives — nearly 40,000, taken from the 1950s to the ’70s — at a Chicago auction for about $400. He was told they were by Vivian Maier, but a Google search revealed no information about her. Eventually he mounted some of the works on Flickr, which led to a story in the British newspaper The Independent and an exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center about Ms. Maier, a nanny and amateur street photographer who died in 2009. This film, which Mr. Maloof directed with Charlie Siskel, documents his search for the woman behind the images while serving as a sort of feature-length advertisement for the work he owns, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “It’s no surprise that Maier is now the subject of a documentary, given the quality of her work, the nominal exoticism of her life and the secrets that still drift around her,” Ms. Dargis said. “She’s a terrific story — part Mary Poppins, part Weegee — who was at once emancipated and in service.” Still, she added, “time and professional pronouncements will decide if she was an outsider artist or just an unorthodox one who, as a single 20th-century woman, found freedom, her voice and her own private bohemia while under cover of other people’s bourgeois domesticity.” The documentary has been shortlisted as an Oscar contender.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Indeed, it was a show about how that medium invented and used them, or rather stereotyped images of them — the recalcitrant savage, the timeless primitive, the vanishing race — to create an official American saga from a victor’s point of view.

(Showtime) PHILOMENA (2013) With the help of a former political journalist (Steve Coogan), an Irish Roman Catholic woman (Judi Dench, in an Oscar-nominated performance) seeks the son who was taken from her 50 years earlier, when she became pregnant as a teenager and was forced to live in a convent, in this drama directed by Stephen Frears. Their sleuthing takes them to Washington after they discover that the boy — sold for 1,000 pounds — was adopted by an American couple and worked for the Reagan administration as an adult. “Ms. Dench’s Philomena Lee glows with the radiance of someone serene in her faith despite inhumane treatment by the church,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “That she makes you believe her character has the capacity to forgive provides the movie with a solid moral center.” Her dignified performance and the screenplay — adapted by Mr. Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith’s 2009 nonfiction book, “The Lost Child of Philomena Lee” — “stabilize a volatile blend of ingredients,” he added. “In less confident hands, the film could have been a mawkish, rambling tear-jerker.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

The death of Costante Garibaldi added fuel to the fire. All Rome mourns Garibaldi’s grandson ‘‘tué à l’ennemi,’’ as the simple but eloquent inscription on Bruno’s coffin read. As I telegraphed to you yesterday [Jan. 8], no funeral ever drew so vast a crowd, and General Ricciotti Garibaldi’s heartfelt words over his son’s grave, foreshadowing Italy’s speedy avenging of the lieutenant’s death, stirred the blood of the whole nation. There was, at the beginning of the European war, a great outburst on the part of the Italian people. War against Austria appeared inevitable, as a consequence of the aggressive action against Servia, which action, in case it proved successful, would have profoundly affected the Balkanic equilibrium. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Jan. 10, 1915",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/1915-anger-over-garibaldis-death/

The world remembers Virginia better than her enigmatic older sister: Parmar restores the symmetry of their relationship in the familial landscape, showing how essential Vanessa’s steadying force was to Virginia’s precarious balance.

Yet its meaning has lately become more elusive. Are suicide bombers “cowardly,” as we are so often assured they are, or insanely courageous? Is it more cowardly to refuse to fight or to fight for fear of being called a coward for not fighting? Some people claim to have the answers to such questions about this once familiar and unproblematic subject, but they tend to disagree. There is no consensus as to who is a coward and who is not — or even about whether the question is one of any importance. Cowardice, whatever it means, must seem a matter of individual choice, like everything else, and the implied judgment made by the term probably requires that we decline to use it at all.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/books/review/cowardice-a-brief-history-by-chris-walsh.html

According to Jason Sokol, whose anecdotally rich first book, “There Goes My Everything,” tracked white Southerners variously coping in the civil rights era, historians have paid insufficient attention to the Janus-faced ­responses of white Northerners to the struggles of black Americans. To be sure, monographs by James Goodman and Thomas Sugrue have explored the dark side of Northern race relations.

When Gerritsen’s son wanted a vacation from the farm he and his partner own in Maine, his parents agreed to take over for two weeks. “There’s a comforting rhythm to farming,” Gerritsen wrote on her blog. “Every morning, the cows stand eagerly at the fence, excited to see us bringing hay, and the sheep come stam­peding like hungry children. . . . I’ve found out that I love hanging out with chickens. I’ve learned which hen leaves the flock every morning to hide out with the sheep, and which hen sneaks away to spend time with the outcast rooster. I’ve learned the secret places where those two lay their eggs. I’ve learned that the alpha rooster can be brutal with hens (and I’m going to talk to my son about turning him into coq au vin).” The wry sadism of that last sentence won’t surprise Gerritsen’s readers — in the opening pages of “Die Again,” a murdered taxidermist is discovered “hung and dressed like game” in his garage, with organs discarded in a nearby trash can. The inspiration for the organs, at least, may have come from the farm. “Thanks to my son,” Gerritsen wrote when her stint was done, “I’ve also been blessed with a bountiful supply of free-range eggs and chicken livers. Will all this turn up in a book some day? Trust me, I’m thinking about it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But many archaeologists themselves seem to experience this sense of connection more or less continuously.

Collaborating with Max Pearmain, the stylist and editor of fashion magazine Arena Homme Plus, as well as the art director Jonathan Baron, Pieter created a voyeuristic look at the new collection, which features a cool merging of activewear with unconventional tailoring and knitwear: athletic tights layered under knit tops with slashed openings (inspired by Lucio Fontana paintings) and unstructured outerwear made from fabrics typically used for uniforms of the Royal Guard. Filmed in a bleak office environment with expansive views of London’s Financial District and composed of grainy time-stamped clips mimicking security footage, the video, which will run on loop during the presentation, “grounds the clothes,” says the young designer (albeit rather eerily). For this new season, as with his previous two collections, Pieter, who worked both in publishing (Fantastic Man) and design (for Jil Sander under Raf Simons) before launching his own line in early 2014, explores the loosening and blurring of men’s sartorial norms through more feminine cuts and roomier silhouettes. “There’s a dark twisted way of sexuality,” Pieter says, “that I’m always thinking about.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/sebastiaan-pieter-debuts-his-fallwinter-2015-mens-collection-in-an-eerie-new-video/

2015-01-09,"Scenes of France, Sketched in Oil",Oil sketches are the Twitter of 18th-century painting. The Morgan Library & Museum will focus on the history of the practice in “Exploring France: Oil Sketches From the Thaw Collection.”,"Oil sketches are the Twitter of 18th-century painting, dashed off sometimes in mere minutes to capture a fleeting idea or a quality of light that would be gone forever with the next cloud bank. Their power is not only in their immediacy but also in how they prefigure outdoor painters who elevated landscape as a genre. Starting Tuesday, the Morgan Library & Museum will focus on the history of the practice in “Exploring France: Oil Sketches From the Thaw Collection.” The collector Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, benefactors of the Morgan and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, have donated 135 oil sketches to the two institutions, in addition to giving hundreds of old master and 19th-century drawings to the Morgan. Mr. Thaw has described the sketches as “the most wonderful, fresh, free pieces on paper” — work that mattered to him because it mattered to the artists, who considered them much more than disposable studies: “They traded them amongst each other, and they preserved them.” (Through Oct. 4, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/arts/design/exploring-france-oil-sketches-from-the-thaw-collection-at-the-morgan.html

The charismatic curator, short in stature and large in vitality, in 1969 convinced that stodgiest of institutions — the Metropolitan Museum of Art — to, for a blockbuster exhibition, swap its Rembrandts and Renoirs for Rosenquists and Rauschenbergs. Formally titled “New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970,” the exhibition was colloquially dubbed “Henry’s Show,” which stuck in the history books as its proper name. That show contained nearly 410 works by more than 40 artists — the very catalysts of contemporary art whose fabled exploits, fueled by creativity, community and feuds, composed the history of the New York School. And many of these artists counted Geldzahler as a close personal friend. Frank Stella famously said, “The thing about Henry was that he lived with us. Other curators don’t live with artists.” Another thing about Geldzahler, according to David Hockney: “Henry had a fantastic eye. He wasn’t wrong about anything.

She also discovers sex and romance with a 19-year-old — the stepson (Christopher Abbott) of a potential client her father is desperate to impress — who has allowed his doting mother (Julie White) to believe he is gay. “Needless to say, there are complications, some farcical, some belonging more to the realm of therapeutic melodrama,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “This is ultimately a tale of affirmation, self-acceptance and second chances, and its lessons, while not unwelcome, are a bit too forced and neatly packaged to make it fully satisfying.

The first is, if you can’t picture yourself reading a particular book nightly for, oh, two straight months, don’t even bring it into the house. Small children have a huge appetite for repetition, and you never know what will catch their interest. So be wary. I recently brought home “Hello Kitty Goes to Camp,” which comes with postcards to send home, thinking it would be an opportunity for “ironic” bonding with my frighteningly culturally sophisticated preteenage daughter. She didn’t bite. Then the 4-year-old found it and, fascinated by his sister’s two recent sleepaway camp disappearances, has demanded to hear it for many, many nights now.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/books/review/roz-chasts-around-the-clock.html

2015-01-14,Corduroy Gets a Luxurious Reboot at the London Men’s Wear Shows,"One of the favored fabrics of the ’70s found its way onto the runways this week, but these weren’t the thrifty sort of cords one might expect.","It’s clear that ’70s nostalgia is the trend of the moment, with designers of both women’s and men’s fashion lately taking cues from the decade in their collections. So it comes as no surprise that one of the favored fabrics of the era, corduroy, found its way into the men’s shows in London this week. These weren’t the thrifty sort of cords one might expect, however. The new designer Alex Mullins, who debuted his collection in a fluorescent-lit room filled with empty cardboard boxes, featured Me Decade-inspired knits and denim as well as corduroy. One look referenced the classic professorial type (think Donald Sutherland in the 1978 comedy “Animal House”), but its slightly odd proportions — cropped and flared trousers with a fitted jacket — made the suit more eccentric than dowdy. J.W. Anderson incorporated the durable ridged fabric — in a very ’70s powder blue, to boot — into a short zipped jacket with a contrasting black collar. Styled with a pair of leather trousers on a model with slick hair, the jacket looked sharp, urbane and dangerously cool. And at Burberry Prorsum, the British fashion house’s traditional trench was fabricated in a larger-scaled corduroy, giving the coat a bit more heft and the retro cloth a much more modern vibe.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/london-mens-collection-fall-2015-corduroy-gets-a-luxurious-reboot/

C. Handy, who helped get those “lonesome songs” out into the world. But there is far more to Bluff City than blues and barbecue. A watermelon and feta salad can be found alongside great smokehouse meats; zydeco and indie rock are within earshot of soul; and up-and-coming areas like Cooper-Young are giving the city’s older haunts some stiff competition. For this short visit, leave out the Graceland juggernaut, though if Elvis is on your bucket list, head out any morning to Graceland’s Meditation Garden where the King is buried — it’s peaceful and free.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-memphis.html

His deeply personal Bach performances are especially compelling. In this essential new recording of three of Bach’s English Suites (No. 3 in G minor, No. 1 in A, No. 5 in E minor), he uses the full tonal and colorist resources of the modern piano while vividly conveying Baroque style and sensibility.

Christopher Shannon, who has made it his signature to deconstruct and dissect active sportswear, used his designs as commentary on commercial industries and the economy. With slogans like “Thanks 4 Nothing,” “Save Me” and “Broke” knitted into brightly colored intarsia jumpers, the ostensibly humorous collection revealed a darker undercurrent. While Sarah Burton’s military-inspired collection for Alexander McQueen displayed a mastery of tailoring, the bold capitalized words “HONOUR,” “VALOUR” and “TRUTH” inscribed across blazers and coats made a bigger statement. And lastly, the American designer Shaun Samson, who returned with a runway show after two seasons away, brought a Southern California flair to the London scene with his collection of bold flannel plaids, Dickies-inspired chinos and aprons adorned with the phrases “DELUSIONAL RADICAL BLISS” and “GNARLY DANK DUDE.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/london-mens-collections-trend-words-christopher-shannon-alexander-mcqueen-shaun-samson/

2015-01-14,Alexandra Fuller’s ‘Leaving Before the Rains Come’,"After a divorce, Alexandra Fuller looks to her Zambian past for guidance in leading an independent life.","A memoir often takes one of two basic forms: In the first, the writer has an extraordinary story to tell; in the second, she has the ability to tell the common story in an extraordinary way. Sometimes — Mary McCarthy’s “Memories of a Catholic Girlhood” is an example, Paula Fox’s “Borrowed Finery” another — the two are conflated in events on whose extremity the artistic mind succeeds in imposing literary form. I once heard the writer Aharon Appelfeld, asked why he had underplayed the savagery of his Holocaust childhood in one of his books, give the answer that extremity, whether imaginary or real, is harmful to art. What he perhaps meant was that the artist’s aim is to represent truth, and that certain experiences — those that infringe or violate the common sense of reality — can never be made to seem true. Joan Didion dealt interestingly with this problem in “The Year of Magical Thinking,” making the surreality of her husband’s death at the dinner table a space the reader could philosophically inhabit. And likewise Alexandra Fuller, writing about her often tragically idiosyncratic African childhood in “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” brilliantly succeeded in retaining a child’s astonished objectivity at the unfolding of bizarre events.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/books/review/alexandra-fullers-leaving-before-the-rains-come.html

On the Dallas campus last March, in his sweatshirt and baggy bluejeans, Steinberg looked more like a guy at the local horse track. He riffled through a booklet of notes and popped a stick of Nicorette into his mouth. His client, the quarterback Garrett Gilbert, was the one who had to put on a show in front of more than 30 N.F.L. scouts, but Steinberg’s own prospects were also being tested.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/show-leigh-steinberg-the-money-again-.html

2015-01-15,The Weird Science of Naming New Products,"To find the perfect brand, leave no word unturned.","The announcement came in November with two names attached: one famous, one not, or at least not yet.

The not-yet-famous name was of the virtual-reality production process that created this experience. Reviewers said it was “mind-­blowingly cool” and an “exciting preview of the future,” but it was also so novel that it had been hard to think of a word to label it. Its inventors had wanted a name that would lodge in the public consciousness the same way Dolby and Imax and Blu-ray had. A name that could become a verb as well as a noun. An iconic name.

His ballets also contain despair, jealousy and satire, but he confined those things to acting. He expressed delight by means of dances, made especially in terms of pure classical ballet. This week, principals and soloists of the Royal Danish Ballet perform six of those dance sequences at the Joyce Theater.

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, citing “You’ve Got Mail” and “The Shop Around the Corner.” “But the idea of two lonely souls connecting in a vast, modern metropolis, and remaining strangers even as their intimacy grows, has a durable charm. As do Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaur, islands of melancholy calm surrounded by silliness and noise. Their performances are not exactly subtle — nothing in ‘The Lunchbox’ is exactly subtle — but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore.

It is the thrill of living rough. And it explains why the operatic event of the moment in London is a new Covent Garden production of Monteverdi’s “Orfeo” that is not actually playing at Covent Garden but at the Roundhouse: a cavernous industrial building in North London’s edgy Camden Town that once held trains but now holds music, though not often music of this kind.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/arts/music/a-new-orfeo-steps-off-the-pedestal.html
2015-01-16,TV’s New Girls’ Club,Great shows used to be about fallen masculinity. Now they’re about collaboration and resilience. What changed?,"There is a moment in HBO’s “Doll & Em” when Em, a movie star, leaves her trailer to rehearse her lines alone. Doll, Em’s childhood best friend and now her assistant, stays behind. In an echo of “All About Eve,” Doll picks up her friend’s script and starts reading aloud. “ 'Why didn’t you call me?’ ‘I didn’t think it was my place,' ” she says, intoning both parts and knowing she’s overstepping. The script is terrible. It’s derivative. But it’s a transgressive moment for Doll and a distillation of her complicated envy toward Em. The sharp parody happening in that scene — of great films, of female friendship, of Hollywood’s idea of better roles for women — coexists with an air of unstudied sincerity that’s in fact subversive. It’s a mood typical of the show and bespeaks a broader sophistication that has finally found its way onto the small screen, over a decade into what we’ve so often heard is a TV renaissance.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/tvs-new-girls-club.html

They have been coming in here every day now for four or five weeks, at first in groups of twenty to thirty, and then by hundreds. It is beginning to look as if the greatest International Column of all time will be fighting for Finland by spring. The backbone of this International Brigade will be the Swedish corps under General Eric Linder, a powerful force trained and equipped and paid for by Swedes. It will operate under the supreme command of the Finnish General Staff. Otherwise, it will resemble a private army.

Robert Lennon’s funny and poignant new collection, a family discovers a “magic portal” in their backyard. The “oval, sort of man-sized, shimmering thing” not only transports them to other worlds; it also serves as the reader’s entree to the rest of the book, with its array of futuristic and surreal psychic landscapes. The breezy blend of realism and fantasy is characteristic: The narrator, a world-weary dad, describes the first giddy era of exploration, which soon declines into domestic dysfunction as his children hit puberty and his wife grows distant. The portal, mirroring this entropy, becomes “lopsided, with a sort of hernia in the lower left corner,” and the narrator is left bereft and aching, trying to find his way back to some semblance of enchantment.

2015-01-16,"‘The First Bad Man,’ by Miranda July",A perverse houseguest shakes the world of the initially passive protagonist of Miranda July’s first novel.,"Cheryl Glickman has a psychosomatic lump in her throat that sometimes prevents her from swallowing. She also has a burning crush on a man named Phillip Bettelheim who wants her blessing before he consummates his love for an underage girl, and a karmic connection with a child she calls Kubelko Bondy, whose spirit continually appears to her in other people’s babies. Cheryl is the protagonist of Miranda July’s very funny debut novel, “The First Bad Man,” and she’s such an acute observer that her life is never as pathetic to the reader as it appears to the people around her. She has developed systems for everything, including a rigid housekeeping asceticism that helps her stave off the kind of debilitating sadness that, if left unchecked, can snowball from letting dirty dishes pile up in the sink to eating off said dirty dishes, to no longer bathing, to urinating in cups because they’re closer to the bed. Her ideal is unruffled contentment. When things really flow, she says, “my days become dreamlike, no edges anywhere, none of the snags and snafus that life is so famous for. After days and days alone it gets silky to the point where I can’t even feel myself anymore, it’s as if I don’t exist.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/books/review/the-first-bad-man-by-miranda-july.html

The plot of these books — in which a charismatic hero makes his way from Mars’s oppressed underclass into the ruling elite, where he plans a secret insurrection — has reminded some critics of the Hunger Games series, while putting others (O.K., me) in mind of Arthur Krystal’s observation about pulp fiction: “Skilled genre writers know that a certain level of artificiality must prevail, lest the reasons we turn to their books evaporate.” But in an interview last year with the publishing trade magazine Kirkus, Brown, who is 26, suggested the series is less artificial than it seems, at least to the extent it reflects his generation’s distrust of the political system. “I’m not trying to make a statement,” he said; “I just think it echoes a lot of the dissatisfaction that many people feel with those who make the decisions based on their own self-interests, rather than what is in the best interests of society. It’s people being selfish.” In the same interview, Brown said his views of cliques and social structures had been shaped in part by his childhood experiences moving from state to state with his family. “A lot of times, I faced bullies — or the ‘big dogs’ at school. What I wanted ‘Red Rising’ to be is not necessarily an indictment on bullies, but it reflects my experiences and attitudes that I had with bullies growing up. A lot of times, you had to beat the bullies at their own game. But the difficulty is not becoming the bully yourself.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/books/review/inside-the-list.html

New passenger car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 5.7 percent in the European Union last year, reaching about 12.6 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association reported from Brussels. It was the first annual expansion since 2007, when the market peaked at nearly 16 million new passenger cars. Spain led the major national markets in 2014, with government trade-in incentives helping to lift sales by more than 18 percent. Germany, Europe’s largest auto market, grew 2.9 percent. Still, the industry is not out of danger. The stagnant economy in most of Europe, as well as crushing unemployment in countries like Greece and Spain, will continue to weigh on the market. LMC Automotive, a market research firm, estimates that European sales will gain just 1.1 percent in 2015.

There has been a great deal of whispered talk in the upper art circles of London for months past concerning Mr. Ruskin’s state and the peculiar circumstances by which he is environed. There has been no public comment on the matter, because of the general desire, among his most intimate friends, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Burne Jones and others, to have nothing said about it. Now, however, the removal of his publisher from Orpington to London, and the change in the sale of Mr. Buskin’s books from the no discount system, which he instituted, to the ordinary methods prevailing in the book trade, with other circumstances, make further secrecy impossible.

Determined to find native counterparts of Mickey Mouse and Popeye, the Frenchmen have sent out an invitation to all artists, cartoonists and designers to submit their most fanciful brainchildren for study and possible adaptation. The invitation has been answered by scores of good, and — no doubt — bad and indifferent artists. At the Centrale de Coordination des Métiers, 5 Rue de Logelbach, one can see the results of the response in the form of drawings, silhouettes, cutouts and marionettes.

Lancelot Thwaytes sued Sotheby’s for £11 million (about $16.7 million) in damages, claiming that the auctioneers had insufficiently researched his painting “The Cardsharps.” The auction house described the work, below, which depicts two hustlers trying to cheat another man in a card game, as a 17th-century copy of the original by the Italian master Caravaggio. The painting was purchased by a friend of the British collector Denis Mahon, who died in 2011 and who, after further analysis, declared it an authentic Caravaggio and valued the painting at £10 million. The Financial Times reported that Judge Vivien Rose dismissed Mr. Thwaytes’s claim, saying in her ruling that the auctioneers had examined the painting thoroughly, and reasonably concluded that the painting was not of high enough quality to be a Caravaggio. The disputed painting is currently on loan to the Museum of the Order of St John in London.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/arts/design/a-win-for-sothebys-in-dispute-over-painting.html

2015-01-19,What’s On TV Monday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TMC) STARRING SIDNEY POITIER Stanley Kramer’s “The Defiant Ones” (1958), about an uneducated black convict on a chain gang who goes on the lam with his “other half,” a white Southern bigot portrayed by Tony Curtis, above left, ushers in this tribute to Mr. Poitier, right (between them is Cara Williams). In 1964, Mr. Poitier became the first black person to win a best-actor Oscar and three years later was the nation’s top box-office draw. “In its candid presentment of racial conflict and resentment,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, “it rips right into the subject with clawing ferocity and flails it about with merciless fury until all the viciousness in conflict is spent.” In James Clavell’s “To Sir, With Love” (1967), at 10, Mr. Poitier stars as Thackeray, an idealistic new teacher in London assigned to a school near the city’s docks, where his Cockney-accented students are ill mannered and insolent. Christian Roberts plays Denham, the arrogant teenager who incites Thackeray’s latest classroom edict: If the students want to be treated as the adults they are about to become, they must act like adults. “A nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek,” Mr. Crowther wrote. And in Mr. Kramer’s “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967), at midnight, the liberal principles of an aging couple (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are tested when their daughter (Katharine Houghton) announces her engagement to a black doctor (Mr. Poitier). Mr. Crowther called the movie “a most delightfully acted and gracefully entertaining film, fashioned much in the manner of a stage drawing-room comedy, that seems to be about something much more serious and challenging than it actually is.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

Musician Jack Name","The subject matter on the artist’s new LP is inspired by werewolves, the moons of Jupiter and Name’s own cancer diagnosis and treatment.","“Maybe it’s a strange thing to be a concept album person, but it’s just the way my brain works. I like long, epic, ridiculous things,” says the Los Angeles-based musician Jack Name, a former member of the cult-favorite San Francisco psychedelic band White Fence whose latest LP, “Weird Moons,” is out today via Castle Face Records. On his last record, 2014’s “Light Show,” Name revealed a twisted battle between light and shadows, the subtext of which was a criticism of the use of prescription drugs to suppress children’s creativity. The concept of “Weird Moons” is even more eccentric: a posthumous space trip in which the album’s protagonists transform into werewolves and then shape-shift depending on their proximity to each of Jupiter’s 67 moons.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/jack-name-new-album-los-angeles-musician/

So far this season, though, there have been enough pops of burnt orange on the runway to inspire at least somewhat adventurous men to take on the autumnal shade, à la River Phoenix in the film “My Own Private Idaho.” In London at the Margaret Howell show, an orange jumper — worn on a red-headed model for extra oomph — brought new life to the British designer’s usually somber palette. In Milan, where the shows concluded today, the color continued to permeate some of the bigger collections. For Bottega Veneta, Tomas Maier played with a range of hues, from purple and kelly green to what he called “persimmon,” an orange shade that was deftly implemented in knits, outerwear and accessories like the above scarf. For Jil Sander’s men’s debut under the creative direction of Rodolfo Paglialunga, the designer also deployed accents of retro-inspired colors, including mustard and hunter green as well as a rusty shade seen in a covetable drop-shouldered textured polo. Though the copper-colored teddy-bear coat in No.21’s collection might be a stretch for some men, the matching sweater worn underneath is a much more palatable option to try next fall.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/fashion-trends-orange-in-london-milan-fall-winter-2015/

The improving economy has finally boosted his poll numbers toward at least the mid-40s, probably because plunging gas prices have finally delivered an effective wage increase. His power grab on immigration also seems to have been a limited political success: The move was broadly unpopular but neither immigration nor executive power are top-of-mind issues for most voters, the president’s standing with Hispanics has clearly improved, a brief period of media chiding soon gave way (predictably) to media forgetfulness, and the Republican opposition has been (also predictably) divided and disorganized. And on foreign policy, while the days of presidential rhetoric about allegedly ending wars and routing Al Qaeda are over, there hasn’t been a return to the crisis atmosphere of last spring and summer, giving the president breathing room to claim (plausibly in the case of Russia, less so in the case of ISIS) that his strategies are working.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/state-of-the-union-state-of-the-presidency/

He realizes reality must win in the end, although the fact that the scene that symbolizes this — his ex-wife shooting Bogart in the chest — is itself a re-­enactment of a scene from “They Drive by Night” tells you something about the elasticity of the medium, which, like Escher’s eternal stairwell, feeds even our dreams of escape from the movies. We all agree with Allen, on some level. A life lived at a constant pitch of screwball comedy is a recipe for exhaustion. The relationship of most movie couples would not last five minutes beyond the closing credits of the films in which they appear. And yet such is the movies’ unrivaled express train to the limbic brain, where Ingrid Bergman’s face appears projected the size of a mother as seen by an infant, that trying to see what the medium has done to the shape of our desires can be as difficult as trying to see the edges of the sky.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/books/review/reeling-through-life-and-silver-screen-fiend.html

I’m still catching up with Blu-ray as a video technology. But now Decca has issued some classic opera recordings from its catalog remastered from the original tapes in what is called Blu-ray Pure Audio. I’m loath to apply the word “pure” to anything. Still, listening to this reissue of the landmark 1972 recording of Puccini’s “Turandot,” with the dynamic Zubin Mehta conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and a dream cast headed by Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, I have to say the sound quality is clean, vivid and strikingly detailed. Ms. Sutherland, the reigning bel canto soprano of her day, was tempted into the studio to sing Turandot, a vocally weighty role she never performed in a house. Her voice is gleaming and penetrating, and Mr. Mehta draws surprising intensity from an artist who could be stolid. Mr. Pavarotti is in his prime as Calaf. With the sumptuous Montserrat Caballé as Liù, Nicolai Ghiaurov as Timur and, of all people, Peter Pears as the old emperor, this is quite the cast.

Embellished pieces by Naeem Khan round out the assortment.

2015-01-23,Disparate Education Plans From Obama and Cuomo,"President Obama proposes to make community college free for two years for qualifying students. Education ideas that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo endorsed include a tax credit for charitable contributions to public, charter and parochial schools.","Since President Obama announced his proposal this month to make community college free for two years for qualifying students, arguments for and against the plan have been abundant. Some have assailed the initiative as futile, maintaining that federal Pell grants already cover the cost of community college for most poor and working-class students, and that the real obstacle comes not in tuition but in living expenses and the high price of textbooks. In actuality, tuition covered by the new subsidy would free up Pell grants to help alleviate those burdens.",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/nyregion/disparate-education-plans-from-obama-and-cuomo.html

Rooney Mara, in an Oscar-nominated performance, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery. “She is a marvelous pop-culture character, stranger and more complex than the average superhero and more intriguing than the usual boy wizards and vampire brides,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Lisbeth, first played by Noomi Rapace in the 2010 Swedish adaptation. “It has been her fate, unfortunately, to make her furious, uninspiring way through a series of plodding and ungainly stories.” And “despite the slick intensity of Mr. Fincher’s style, his movie is not immune to the same lumbering proceduralism,” Mr. Scott said, while acknowledging that “Mr. Fincher’s impressive skill is evident.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

Although Paderewski was speaking not as a musician but as a Pole in the service of his nation, and although the voice of an aged man still weak from illness could not develop those crescendos that have never failed to thrill listeners as his long delicate fingers hit the keyboard, the nobility of his ideas and the dramatic turn of his phrases made the speech a series of forensic fortissimos. In the awareness that he might not live to see again the state of which he had the honor to be the first President, Paderewski stamped this discourse as the last will and testament to Poland of one of its servants. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 24, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/1940-paderewski-vows-deliverance/

When a writer changes names and genres, for one thing — as did the British author Paula Hawkins, whose “debut thriller,” “The Girl on the Train,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2. To judge from the Q. and A. at her publisher’s website, you’d never know that Hawkins, a financial journalist for 15 years, previously wrote romantic comedies under a pseudonym. “That was women’s fiction, I suppose,” Hawkins told NPR in a recent interview. “Much more lighthearted, not so much killing. . . . I did enjoy writing them, but they kept getting darker and darker. And once I started writing this book I knew this was what I was supposed to be doing. It just felt completely right for me. This sounds awful, but I’m not, you know, a joyful, romantic person. Well, I can be, but I’ve got a proper dark side and I enjoy indulging it.” She’s not kidding: “The Girl on the Train” is about an alcoholic commuter, fired from her job, who spins an obsessive fantasy about a couple along her train route and who may know something about the wife’s disappearance. (Comparisons to “Gone Girl” are not misplaced.) I had no luck unearthing Hawkins’s earlier pseudonym, but I did find a financial guide she published under her own name in Britain, “The Money Goddess,” which invents a group of “Sex and the City""-like friends as it dispenses advice about shopping for mortgages or planning for retirement.

The next, she was the proud mother of her first child, who was nicknamed BBBB in the hospital, for Big Baby Boy Bogue (her husband’s last name). This would hardly be considered extraordinary if it weren’t for the fact that she had recently been named the company’s C.E.O. Female chief executives typically live in glass boxes where every move they make is held up for intense public scrutiny, and most get themselves there through brutal amounts of work and by avoiding anything that draws attention to the fact that they’re women. Yet right after starting her job running a troubled $30 billion technology giant, Mayer announced that she would be taking a maternity leave, albeit a stunningly short one. (She took two weeks.) The audacity of the move — accepting a top executive job knowing that she was five months pregnant and then taking so little time off — prompted an Internet outcry (“The Pregnant C.E.O.: Should You Hate Marissa Mayer?” Forbes asked in one representative example), in which even progressives grumbled about the privilege involved, including Mayer’s household staff and in-office nursery. And so it was that her upsetting of the women’s­-issues industrial complex became all that most people know about Mayer. Yet there is much more to the picture.

2015-01-25,When Mango Mania Was Revolutionary ,Mango madness pervaded Chinese culture in 1968.,"In 1968, two years after he began the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong wrested it from the hands of avid but unruly students and handed it over to a more worshipful working class. During the transition, he happened to receive, as an ambassadorial gift from Pakistan, a basket of fresh mangoes. And as a symbolic act of largess, he had the exotic fruit delivered to a group of workers. In doing so, he created an instant cult. Not only was the fruit not eaten, but it was also revered as an emblem of the leader’s godlike love. The mangoes were preserved and became objects of worship. Wax and plastic duplicates were created and enshrined. Mango madness pervaded the culture: Images of the yellow fruit appeared in posters, on porcelain and in textile designs. “Mao’s Golden Mangoes and the Cultural Revolution,” a China Institute exhibition organized by the art historian Alfreda Murck, perfectly captures the devotional fervor of that moment. And a mere moment it was. Within a year, the fad was over. Mango memorabilia went into closets and then to flea markets, from which Ms. Murck, who lived many years in Beijing, rescued choice examples to tell this fascinating tale of consumerist infatuation.

It’s an extraordinary number driven by audience demand and a willingness to pay high ticket prices of up to $425, an amount that few plays have charged before. Plays with popular stars (Bradley Cooper in “The Elephant Man,” Bryan Cranston in “All the Way”) often have advance sales of several million dollars, while even many musicals — which tend to be bigger sellers than plays — often struggle to build an eight-figure advance. A spokesman for the play’s lead producer, Scott Rudin, confirmed the figure on Sunday. It beats the previous record for a play, $13.05 million for the 2013 revival of Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal,” another Rudin production, starring the real-life couple Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz. Mr. David (above) is widely known as the star of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and co-creator and head writer of “Seinfeld.” He is both the author and star of “Fish in the Dark,” his first play, a comedy about a death in the family. “Fish in the Dark,” directed by Anna D. Shapiro (a Tony winner for “August: Osage County”), is scheduled to begin performances on Feb. 2 at the Cort Theater.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/theater/larry-david-racks-up-a-big-broadway-advance.html

Writing in The New York Times, Renata Adler called “Belle de Jour” “a really beautiful movie, and somehow, letting the color in — this is Buñuel’s first color film — has changed the emotional quality of his obsessions in a completely unpredictable way.” In “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), an Oscar-winner for best foreign film, at 10, six upwardly mobile friends try to have dinner together — but find they can’t. “In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted,” Vincent Canby wrote, “ ‘The Discreet Charm’ moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel’s experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.” The lineup continues with “Diary of a Chambermaid” (1964), an adaptation of the novel by Octave Mirbeau about the foibles and hypocrisy of the landed gentry as seen through the eyes of a worldly domestic (Jeanne Moreau), at midnight; “Viridiana” (1962), in which a young nun (Silvia Pinal) tries to help the poor after inheriting a fortune, at 2 a.m.; and “The Exterminating Angel” (1962), where guests at a lavish dinner party in an elegant home in Mexico City find themselves unable to leave the parlor for several days, during which the social order begins to break down, at 3:45.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/arts/whats-on-tv-monday.html

It had been four years since I first told Yee that I was interested in writing about Brady, even though I typically cover politics. I grew up in the Boston suburbs, rooted for the Patriots as a kid and even possessed vague memories of watching the team play at Fenway Park, one of their homes before they settled into the nowhereland of Foxborough, Mass., in 1971. My friend Josh and I once wrote a letter to the team’s young quarterback, Jim Plunkett, inviting him to dinner at Josh’s house. (Plunkett never responded.) Their teams were mostly bad, their owner was an embarrassment, their stadium a dump. Yet the Patriots always retained a lovable haplessness about them, with their cute minuteman logos, their A.F.L. lineage and the identity crisis that comes from being named after an entire region instead of a city or state.

And the slick plastic made a comeback in the fall/winter men’s collections last week, giving an alluring, glossy finish to some of the looks. Calvin Klein’s  Italo Zucchelli deployed the fabric — in both gray and black — in a range of familiar men’s silhouettes including baggy trousers, parkas, and shrunken pilot jackets.

The actors, both 43, have become synonymous with the kind of quirky indie fare that has come to epitomize Sundance over the years: Ryder, as the breakout star of “Beetlejuice” and with her roles in the cult films “Heathers” and “Edward Scissorhands” in the late ’80s and early ’90s; and Sarsgaard with celebrated turns in the Sundance films “The Dying Gaul,” “An Education” and “Garden State,” among others. This week, they star alongside one another for the first time in “Experimenter,” the director Michael Almereyda’s drama about the social psychologist Stanley Milgram and his controversial experiments on obedience in the 1960s. It’s a peculiar film — as Milgram, Sarsgaard routinely breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera; at several points an elephant appears from seemingly nowhere to hint at the deeper meaning behind Milgram’s experiments — and yet it never crumbles under its own weight, thanks to the steady talents of Sarsgaard and Ryder, who plays Milgram’s wife, Sasha.

A lawyer for WikiLeaks, Michael Ratner, told journalists in Geneva that the group had written on Monday to Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, and to American officials demanding details and explanations for “search and seizure” warrants issued to Google by the Department of Justice in March 2012. In response to the warrants, Google turned over to law enforcement authorities all data associated with the accounts of the journalists, Mr. Ratner said. WikiLeaks said it was “astonished and disturbed” that Google had waited more than two and a half years to notify the journalists that the authorities had issued the warrants, denying them the opportunity to oppose them in court. A Google spokesman said that its policy was to inform people about government requests for their data “except in limited cases, like when we are gagged by a court order, which sadly happens quite often.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/27/world/europe/wikileaks-assails-google-and-the-us.html

It could be the case — it’s about pushing boundaries and experimenting.” Asked to select a standout item, Kronthaler mentions the Pirate Trouser, originally from Westwood’s 1981 Pirate collection, for its “muscly, active-looking, dynamic leg shape”; Leon, however, declined to choose just one. “It’s hard to pick specifics because it’s about telling the whole story,” he says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/t-magazine/opening-ceremony-vivienne-westwood-worlds-end.html

(13, 49) PENGUIN POST OFFICE Every summer in the Southern Hemisphere, a British post office at Port Lockroy, above, becomes the most popular tourist attraction for cruise ships to the Antarctic Peninsula, as some 3,000 gentoo penguins take up residence alongside the other seasonal inhabitants: volunteers from the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust, who run the remote outpost. There, each November, after a bout of intensive deep-sea fishing, the gentoos find their mates, build their nests, raise their young — and pose for pictures, as long as the photographer stays 15 feet away. This “Nature” episode ventures to Antarctica to film the four-month ritual.

2015-01-28,Yasmina Reza’s ‘Happy Are the Happy’,Yasmina Reza’s novel tells interlinked stories of yearning.,"Like a handful of the 18 people who populate her latest novel, “Happy Are the Happy,” Yasmina Reza is formidably accomplished. A prolific novelist and playwright — two of her works for the stage, “Art” and “God of Carnage,” won Tony Awards for best play — as well as a screenwriter and actress, she haunts the halls of power in her native France. “Happy Are the Happy” is another coup, a quick and delicate book that’s as funny as it is humane. Each of its short chapters, titled with the name of the character speaking, is told in the first person and concerns, for the most part, other characters in the book soon to introduce themselves if they haven’t already. Everyone gets a word in, and the style is feathery as gossip. Characters chime with one another in ways they never realize, a conviviality that is bittersweet. Their voices are self-aware, a little jaundiced, vulnerable, sometimes plaintive, and entirely authentic. Accomplishment, Reza suggests, is no hedge against yearning or regret. Status, wealth, celebrity, sex appeal and good health are unevenly distributed and ­underappreciated, until they are in decline. Life isn’t sparkly, it’s a slog: “People, practically oldsters, lurching around Paris, bearing their lives.” Perhaps chasing the impractical is simply a way to stay in motion.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/yasmina-rezas-happy-are-the-happy.html

As befits a novel about a popular sitcom, this novel packs in lots of laughs, but it’s also got more heft than Mr. Hornby’s readers may expect. Its story begins in 1964, when the standards for everything that Britain found funny, familiar, thrilling and off limits were drastically changing. And its characters create the biggest hit on the BBC with a show that’s a sign of its times.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/books/nick-hornbys-funny-girl-about-a-1960s-bbc-sitcom-star.html

The breakout star of the Gutai Art Association, Shiraga became colloquially known as the “foot painter”; the Japanese postwar movement’s founder, Jiro Yoshihara, even dismissed Shiraga as a “nobody, if he didn’t paint with his feet.” After his 1955 performance “Challenging Mud,” in which the artist wrestled a mixture of cement, gravel, clay, plaster, pebbles and twigs into a “formless form,” Shiraga devised an entirely new painting technique. From 1959 onward, he suspended himself from his studio ceiling and manipulated the paint exclusively with his ten toes to create a range of textures from the slinky and supple to the protruding and violent. Almost 60 years later, Shiraga, whose dynamic contributions blend painting and performance, is still a misunderstood radical who is only now receiving the sort of American institutional and gallery attention that properly contextualizes the depth and reach of his practice.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/kazuo-shiraga-foot-painter-gutai-art/

Steven Sebring’s 360-degree photographs of Krakoff’s designs — the same signature technique utilized in the photographer’s recent book featuring Coco Rocha, “Study of Pose” — will also be on prominent display. “The juxtaposition of these things tells a story,” Krakoff says. “It’s different than the typical shopping experience.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/reed-krakoff-new-soho-boutique/

Fuller’s new book describes the collapse of her marriage, and in a recent interview with the Times reporter Penelope Green she bristled at the idea that she would have shown a draft to her ex-husband. “There’s almost this expectation you need to get approval,” she said. “I doubt Ernest Hemingway was asked what his ex-wives thought of his writing. I think women have to stop asking for permission.” She didn’t say, though, whether she had shared the memoir with her children, who are 21, 17 and 9. So I asked. “There’s a very fine line,” she said by phone from Washington, D.C., where she was on book tour, “between protecting your children, as you should, and smothering them to the point that they don’t know what’s going down in the world.” She had offered to show relevant passages to her older two, and Sarah, the 21-year-old, took her up on it. “She’s a fantastic writer in her own way,” Fuller said. “At the same time I was working on this book, she wrote an essay about the divorce for her student magazine. It was so poignant. My ex-husband read it and said, That’s not what happened. But of course it was totally from her perspective. It’s another prism. We’re reading each other’s stuff now not just as people who were personally involved, but as writers able to appreciate each other’s talent.” And her 17-year-old son? Fuller laughed. “He has better boundaries than anyone I know. He said, Mum, I lived it. I don’t need to read it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/inside-the-list.html

In words that became famous, he had signaled to his fleet, “England expects that every man will do his duty.” We are likelier to remember the Duke of Wellington’s triumph at Waterloo 10 years later, which ended Napoleon’s sensational career. A comment Wellington supposedly made afterward is also frequently quoted, that the engagement had been “a damned close-run thing.” And as a sidelight to the international conflict there was our own American War of 1812, during which Francis Scott Key was inspired to write his verses about the rockets’ red glare and bombs bursting in air.

To the limited scope of a window frame, the former London journalist Paula Hawkins, in her debut thriller, “The Girl on the Train,” offers a few additional obfuscations. First, her novel’s protagonist, Rachel, looks out through the window of a moving train on her daily commute. Second, Rachel is your basic hot mess: depressed, unemployed, still in mourning for the death of her marriage and prone to alcoholic blackouts that coincide with critical moments in the tale of a missing woman later found dead. Rachel might as well be wearing a sign that reads “Unreliable Narrator.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/the-girl-on-the-train-by-paula-hawkins.html

Like thousands of their Lithuanian landsmen, Cohen’s relatives headed for the sunny, still-undeveloped, resource-­rich country of South Africa. In this new world they began with nothing, worked hard and achieved much. As is often true of successful immigrant families, their grandchildren could live as though the old world had never been. Cohen’s father became a doctor, his mother was college educated. Both were raised with the comforts that only numerous servants can provide: “They never had to boil an egg,” Cohen writes. Being a Jew in South Africa was not unlike being a Jew in the American South: Anti-Semitism was not absent, but it was greatly mitigated by a segregated black underclass all but legally enslaved.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/the-girl-from-human-street-by-roger-cohen.html

How do men write women and vice versa? How do writers of one race or ethnicity write about people of another race or ethnicity? More important, how do writers tackle difference without reducing their characters to caricatures or stereotypes? Some handle the challenge with aplomb. Bill Cheng’s “Southern Cross the Dog” and Louise Erdrich’s “The Round House” come to mind. Others fail: At one point in Kathryn Stockett’s “The Help,” a black woman compares her skin color with that of a cockroach. To write difference well demands empathy, an ability to respect the humanity of those you mean to represent.

The next day when a friend asked Adam if he had sex with the woman, he lied in the traditional manner of boastful, insecure young men everywhere and said that he had, without a condom. “You could have AIDS,” the friend said. That wasn’t true — or was, at most, exceedingly unlikely. Nevertheless, the idea lodged in Adam’s mind, where it set about establishing permanent residency. By the following summer, the fear that he might already have AIDS, or would someday contract it, had hijacked his brain. The “snowflake” of a single intrusive thought, as he puts it, had become a “blizzard” that “blew the snow into every corner of my mind, and laid down a blanket that muffled every surface.” For the next 20 years, Adam was consumed by the fear that he had contracted, or would contract, H.I.V.: He called the National AIDS Helpline so many times daily that the half-dozen staffers there came to recognize his voice; he got blood tests; he compulsively examined and re-examined every red stain he ever came across to determine whether it might be AIDS-tainted blood, and whether it might somehow have contaminated him. He knew this to be irrational — he was a science writer! — yet he couldn’t resist his compulsions. He had developed obsessive-compulsive disorder, or O.C.D.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/david-adams-the-man-who-couldnt-stop.html

She meets her match when she strikes up a friendship with Jake (Jason Sudeikis), a good-natured womanizer who just happens to have taken her virginity 12 years earlier. At the premiere, Headland described the film as “When Harry Met Sally” for jerks (though she used a slightly stronger word), which is to say that, like the director’s previous effort, “Bachelorette,” it is more than a little naughty and twisted (and, it follows, a perfect starring vehicle for Brie). The 32-year-old L.A. native has been stealing scenes for the better part of a decade playing type-A characters on “Mad Men” and “Community,” and she viewed Headland’s film — and its many sex scenes — as an opportunity to try out a new direction.
