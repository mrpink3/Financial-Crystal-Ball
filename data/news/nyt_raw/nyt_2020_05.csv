I kind of cranked forward and cupped Mrs. Prada’s waist the way a high school junior might initiate a slow dance. Then I lurched even closer, barely grazing one side of her cheek on the first try.

2020-05-06,A Quarantine Activity for the Wine Lover,Família Geisse from Brazil sells a sparkling wine that you disgorge yourself.,"I’ve sabered open a bottle of Champagne. But disgorging one? Yes, try this at home. Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/dining/drinks/sparkling-wine-disgorging-coronavirus.html

It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/buddha-statues-face.html

Today, traveling through them reawakens a distant, though not forgotten, past.","IT WAS OCTOBER in Tashkent. The broad Soviet-style avenues of Uzbekistan’s capital were lined with chestnut and Oriental plane, their leaves turning russet in the crisp autumn air. This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/uzbekistan-history-silk-road.html

This is architecture meant to set the soul asoar, but I am conscious only of how far I am below, in the horde at the gates.

2020-05-13,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Ophelia’ and ‘Solar Opposites’,A spin on Shakespeare airs on Showtime. And a new animated sitcom with ties to “Rick and Morty” is on Hulu.,"OPHELIA (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote “King Lear” during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on “Hamlet.” As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an “interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is “Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-ophelia-and-solar-opposites.html

It holds that investigations by Barack Obama’s administration into Russia’s attack on the 2016 U.S. presidential election were a form of illicit sabotage of Donald Trump and his team. The story doesn’t really make sense, which is why, when asked about Obamagate, President Trump couldn’t describe it. But at the heart of the conspiracy theory is “unmasking,” the routine practice by which national security officials find out the names of Americans who appear on intelligence intercepts of foreign actors.

They tend to hold the book’s central mismatched-but-also-kind-of-perfect-together couple, Marianne and Connell, close to their hearts. So adapting the book for TV came with risks. “It was a big leap of faith,” Rooney told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year about casting the show, “that we were going to find people who would just get it, and would know exactly how to communicate that friction between the inner life and the outer world.” Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal have received widespread acclaim for their performances in the 12-part series on Hulu. Some of the praise for the show came from James Poniewozik, The Times’s chief television critic, who called it a “gorgeous, melancholy series” starring leads who “have so much chemistry you may need lab goggles.” Poniewozik recently joined The Times’s three book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — for a discussion I moderated about the show, the novel, the art of adaptation and more. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/books/normal-people-sally-rooney-hulu-adaptation.html

The Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby burst onto the world stage in 2018 with “Nanette,” a Netflix special that challenged what stand-up could or should be. She even vowed to give up comedy, at least as a tool she had long used to confront trauma. In this follow-up special, named after one of her dogs, Gadsby discusses her autism diagnosis, goes after a long list of targets — particularly men and centuries-old forms of patriarchy — and delivers more self-deprecating jokes. If she knew how popular “Nanette” was going to be, she says, she would have paced herself instead of putting all her “trauma eggs into one basket.” When Gadsby performed “Douglas” Off Broadway last summer, The New York Times’s theater critic Jesse Green named it a Critic’s Pick and wrote, “‘Douglas’ is angry — even furious — and draws its comic energy from the effort to master and direct that anger into sharp insight and its byproduct, laughter.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-hannah-gadsby-americas-got-talent.html

Decades later, as social media has catapulted academic jargon into everyday vocabulary, the term has become warped to signify a restructuring of society, with minorities at the top. But still this theory — that identity categories are not mutually exclusive, but integrated components of a single, multidimensional experience — remains immensely relevant today.

This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million. On the scale of New York State’s budget, the system’s main funding source, that’s a rounding error; for our adjuncts and our students, it’s a disaster.

Virtual theater productions, of course, are mediated through technology and thus not experienced as they would be from the front mezzanine, and yet they’re not fully polished or always prerecorded, either. Part of the thrill of theater is its immediacy and, along with it, the potential for something to fall to pieces. That aspect remains perfectly intact, and recent performances have been felled by late starts, spotty internet and A/V connections, missed cues and poor lighting. “It can all feel like the local portions of the Jerry Lewis telethon,” jokes the producer and writer Jonathan Tolins. “As though these actors might be in their laundry rooms.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/t-magazine/zoom-tips-coronavirus.html

And movies from Studio Ghibli are available on HBO’s new streaming service.,"JOAN OF ARC (2020) Rent on Film at Lincoln Center’s virtual cinema. In his 2018 historical drama, “Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc,” the French director Bruno Dumont infused Saint Joan’s formative years with a sonic landscape that featured prominent, raucous guitar shredding. For his follow-up, “Joan of Arc,” Dumont focuses on Joan of Arc’s later years, this time using electronic pop music to help tell the story. The film casts one of the performers who played Joan in Dumont’s earlier movie, Lise Leplat Prudhomme, opposite the French pop singer Christophe, who plays one of the priests who try Joan. “Here and in the earlier picture it’s perhaps easy to apprehend Dumont’s approach with a ‘What’s this oddball up to now?’ smirk,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if Dumont is joking at all, it’s a form of what used to be called ‘kidding on the square.’”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-joan-of-arc-and-princess-mononoke.html

When the movie came out, it was a novel mishmash of early Hollywood technique and a then-contemporary setting. Three decades later, it offers a different viewing experience: it’s a time capsule of 1980s New York.

2020-05-29,An Artist Who Delights in the Minor Key,"Moyra Davey’s work moves freely between photography, video and writing but is united in its unwavering attention to the objects and accidents of everyday life.","In “I Confess,” the final essay in Moyra Davey’s new collection of prose pieces, “Index Cards” (2020), she recalls losing, as a child at school, a pencil given to her by her mother. Thinking it was stolen, she began to sob. Her teacher asked her: “Pourquoi as-tu tant de peine pour un crayon?” (Why so much grief over a pencil?) That question has remained with Davey, the New York-based artist, for 50 years. The anecdote — the triviality of the pencil, the pinprick of a particular line — is emblematic of her art, in which tension comes from small traumas and everyday talismans. Moving between video, photography and prose, Davey’s work is bound by idiosyncratic references and quasi-dreamed connections. An acute chronicler of quotidian life, she is both the narrator and protagonist of her work. She paces her apartment hallways in her videos; she photographs the dust under her bed; she reads and writes restlessly, hoping to find what Walter Benjamin called the “tiny spark of accident” that will set off stray thoughts and images. “Index Cards,” which she wrote between 2003 to 2019, reads like a serial novel and distills Davey’s methodology: Her art is rooted in finding a way to practice and is a record of its own creation.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/t-magazine/moyra-davey.html
