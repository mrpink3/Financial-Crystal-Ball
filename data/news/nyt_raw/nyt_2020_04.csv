Joseph: An Excerpt","An excerpt from “The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.,” by Peniel E. Joseph","Malcolm X inherited the legacy of his parents, Earl Little and Louise Norton Little, proud disciples of the legendary Jamaican organizer Marcus Garvey. Malcolm grew up in a home that celebrated black pride, boldly proclaimed black dignity, and brandished political activism as practically a familial birthright. The members of the Little family were pioneer black nationalists who endeavored to follow Garvey’s dictum of establishing black political power across urban and rural American landscapes. Garvey tapped into deep currents of black political radicalism swirling in a newly reconfigured urban American landscape, one populated by black southern migrants and Caribbean immigrants. The Great Migration, which started between the world wars and crested in the immediate years after blacks won the right to vote, dispersed millions of southern migrants across the nation’s vast expanse, in the process creating archipelagoes of black cultural and political power in small and large cities. Inspired by the bootstrap racial uplift politics of Booker T. Washington and intrigued by anti-colonial rhetoric, Garvey promoted a philosophy of black nationalism that he offered, like Promethean fire, to any black person courageous enough to take it.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/books/review/the-sword-and-the-shield-the-revolutionary-lives-of-malcolm-x-and-martin-luther-king-jr-by-peniel-e-joseph-an-excerpt.html

Like traditional balsamic vinegar, Sirk is made from grapes, not wine, the base for many vinegars. But the similarity ends there. Ribolla Gialla white grapes, prized for winemaking in the region, are macerated and slowly allowed to ferment with their skins for a year. White grapes and skin contact is why the makers, according to Beatrice Ughi, who imports it for her company, Gustiamo, call it the “orange wine” of vinegars.

When she moved into her two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a handsome Victorian terrace house in Earl’s Court in 2011, she discovered two unappealing brushed-metal table lamps that had been wired into the fitted alcove cabinets of her living room by a previous owner. Rather than reaching for a screwdriver, she set about reinventing them with a cache of plaster strips left over from an art project she’d completed during her time at the London College of Communication. Inspired first by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti’s 1930s Tête de Femme lamps, shaped like semi-abstracted female figures, and later by the idea of a fragile flower, she began layering the nondescript bases with the soft, water-soaked gauze. The resulting sculptures are naïve and enchanting: One depicts a woman’s face, its features smoothed and barely discernible, like those of a timeworn marble sculpture; the other evokes a bloom with delicately layered petals, their alabaster white surface mottled by the marks of the artist’s hand.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/t-magazine/viola-lanari.html

2020-04-13,"Enrique Olvera’s Satisfying, Adaptable Vegetable Soup","The chef shares his recipe for a hearty broth-based dish, inspired by the version his grandmother used to make.","In high school, the Mexican chef Enrique Olvera was known to his friends as Pozole. The word, which means “hominy” in Spanish, derived from the Nahuatl “pozolli,” is also the name of a traditional Mexican soup or stew made from shelled kernels of corn, pork and garlic. When Olvera opened his first restaurant in Mexico City in 2000, he called it Pujol, a slurring of the childhood nickname. In many ways, soup has been a throughline in Olvera’s culinary life. He has said that his grandmother’s puchero, made from vegetables and cheap cuts of meat, is the first dish that he remembers eating. Other staples of her kitchen were a lentil soup with plantains and bacon and a vegetable soup made with potatoes, carrots, zucchini and whatever else was good and in season. “My grandfather really liked soups, so we always had them at home,” Olvera says. “He found them heartwarming.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/t-magazine/enrique-olvera-vegetable-soup-recipe.html

Since that day, much has changed: how we think about grass-roots organizing, the ways in which community among marginalized groups is cultivated and fostered, the life expectancy and treatment of people living with H.I.V. and AIDS. While many of the issues the group labored to address also persist, ACT UP has created an indelible blueprint for on-the-ground activism that has paved the way both for other movements, including Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, and for subsequent generations of L.G.B.T.Q. people to continue to fight, unrelentingly, for justice.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-members.html

But instead of making cranes or flowers, she preferred to transform the sheets of printed paper into utilitarian objects, like boxes. “There was something about the ingenuity of a flat object being folded up to be 3-D in order to hold something,” says Ping, 41. One day, inspired by Angus MacGyver, the resourceful secret agent and titular character of the 1980s television series — “He was always finding solutions with little more than chewing gum and a toothpick,” says Ping — she folded a paper tea set for her dolls. “My mom was so annoyed,” she says of the water-soaked mess that ensued. Another creation that stands out in Ping’s mind is a paper boat she made, and that her father, who’d trained as a mechanical engineer, improved upon with side panels made from leftover paper — suddenly, the ordinary canoe was a catamaran. “It even had a canopy,” Ping recalls. “I was like, Oh my god.

AMERICA Stream on FX on Hulu. Cate Blanchett plays the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly in this new mini-series, which revisits the fights for and against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. On the “against” side is Schlafly, a self-described housewife who spent the decade campaigning against the E.R.A., which would have amended the Constitution to legally codify equality between women and men. Fighting her on the “for” side are a cadre of figures from the left, including Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) and Bella Abzug (Margo Martindale). The show tells stories from both sides, as it chronicles events leading up to the defeat of the E.R.A. — a defeat, led by Schlafly, that had lasting effects. “Love her or hate her, you cannot not take away that she was extraordinary,” the series’s creator, Dahvi Waller, a former “Mad Men” writer, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “And if you find yourself rooting for her and hate yourself for it, that’s also fun.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-mrs-america-and-the-main-event.html

2020-04-16,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘The Lighthouse’ and ‘Trolls World Tour’,Robert Eggers’s “The Lighthouse” is streaming on Amazon. And “Trolls World Tour” is available for digital rental.,"THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are given little but each other for company in “The Lighthouse.” The film casts that pair as Winslow and Wake, two 19th-century lighthouse keepers on a small, secluded island off the New England coast. It’s a claustrophobic experience for the characters and audiences alike: Directed by Robert Eggers and filmed in black-and-white, the grimly funny film shows the two men spending their days fighting and drinking, growing closer together even as they antagonize each other. The plot “is thin enough to invite plentiful interpretations about masculinity, homosocial relations and desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The movie’s “more sustained pleasures,” she added, “are its form and style, its presumptive influences (von Stroheim’s ‘Greed,’ German Expressionism), the frowning curve of Winslow’s mustache, the whites of eyes rolled back in terror.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-lighthouse-and-trolls-world-tour.html

2020-04-17,What’s on TV Friday: ‘#blackAF’ and ‘Selah and the Spades’,Kenya Barris’s new sitcom debuts on Netflix. And a well-received debut feature film is streaming on Amazon.,"#BLACKAF Stream on Netflix. “We’re celebrating my dad’s new Netflix show,” Drea (Iman Benson) says at the self-referential beginning of this new sitcom. “I don’t know exactly what it’s about, but pretty sure it has something to do with black stuff.” Created by the screenwriter Kenya Barris (“black-ish,” “Girls Trip”), “#blackAF” stars Barris as a fictionalized, exaggerated version of himself. The show’s Kenya is a successful, cynical screenwriter living an extravagant Los Angeles life and raising children with his wife, played by Rashida Jones. The show explores issues of race, class and wealth — with family dynamics that should resonate well beyond the story’s rarefied setting. “Most families are functionally dysfunctional,” Barris said in a recent interview about the show with The New York Times. “You want the house to be a little bit messy,” he added. “You want the mom to be a little bit frayed. The dad to be a bit out of touch. Some of those things are just part of what family is. I want people to realize that that dysfunction is part of our functionality.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-blackaf-selah-and-the-spades.html

Those of us experiencing a serious uptick in our email correspondence right now — it seems all it took for us to re-embrace the epistolary form was a global pandemic — are freshly acquainted with the clever breeziness, the missives framed as “just checking in,” from people we once knew far better than we do now.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/t-magazine/literary-letter-collections.html

2020-04-17,"‘Man of My Time,’ by Dalia Sofer: An Excerpt","An excerpt from “Man of My Time,” by Dalia Sofer","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and paper—not the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street. My mother, who still only half-jokingly called herself Monir Farahani Ed Dowleh—this last obsolete suffix a reference to her supposed aristocratic heritage—endured his mania with the pragmatism of a jockey putting up with her thoroughbred’s quirks. Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldn’t tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbas–style mustache who was our family’s supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him “Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab.” This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my father’s birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named “Shatt al-Arab” by our Arab neighbors and “Arvand Roud” by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmother’s province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/books/review/man-of-my-time-by-dalia-sofer-an-excerpt.html

It also gives considerable screen time to Jordan’s teammates Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, and head coach, Phil Jackson. A number of big names weigh in, including Bill Clinton, Justin Timberlake and Barack Obama.

She felt confident that such a loss could be a “life-destroying force,” since she saw her mother still broken by the death of her own mother when she was a child. In “Nerve,” Holland also writes intimately about her fears of falling, of heights and, after she was involved in traumatic accidents, of driving. And she writes about the science behind those fears and the methods she and others have used to try to overcome them, including a therapy called E.M.D.R., or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Below, Holland talks about the scary day when she decided to write the book, the progress she made on her fears and how action movies have taught her some things about writing.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/books/nerve-science-fear-eva-holland-interview.html

It rhymed with chai. He was looking at his wife’s breasts in a photograph. They were tight and perky in the white spandex top she wore. Below that, her bikini bottom was just a patch of cloth in the front, held up by thin strings tied into a small bow. She was sitting on the white sheets of an unmade hotel bed and looking straight at the camera, her knees tucked underneath her. The school bus driver thought his wife looked odd in these vacation pictures. She’d never posed this way before, for him. Her black hair was set in big soft curls and she looked like a child’s doll: blue eyelids, long artificial eyelashes, round rosy cheeks, red lips. She would never, on her own, make herself up like this. This bikini would never be something she’d choose for herself. “Hee keyow,” she would say, shaking her head in disapproval if he ever suggested she wear anything even slightly revealing. This bikini must have been Frank’s idea.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/books/review/how-to-pronounce-knife-by-souvankham-thammavongsa-an-excerpt.html
2020-04-21,"‘The Moment of Tenderness,’ by Madeleine L’Engle: An Excerpt","An excerpt from “The Moment of Tenderness,” by Madeleine L’Engle","I was about nine years old, curiously but quietly poking about my grandmother Madeleine L’Engle’s manuscripts so as not to disturb her writing and risk losing the privilege of keeping her company in her “Ivory Tower” while she worked. The Tower was just a room over the garage in the eighteenth-century New England farmhouse where she and my grandfather had lived and raised three children during the 1950s and where they still spent weekends, holidays, and long stretches of summer. I’m not sure who christened it “the Tower,” but the name was used ironically by both her and the rest of the family, an acknowledgment of the privilege of solitude and time. The manuscripts I was poking about in were housed in repurposed ream boxes with words like “Eaton” and “Corrasable Bond” on the sides, and in black three-ring binders whose leather casings were beginning to crack. There were dozens of boxes and binders, including ones with A Wrinkle in Time, The Arm of the Starfish, and A Wind in the Door written on them, but I wasn’t interested in the manuscripts of stories that could be read as real books: I was more curious about the scraps and stories and studies in the other boxes. I came across “Gilberte Must Play Bach” in one of those. I’m not sure why I stopped to read this particular one, but I liked the French name in the title, and the imperative. The story was strange to me, and sad, and although the girl in the story was named Claudine, I understood it to be autobiographical. The sadness of the story—and its unresolvedness—shook me and gave me a glimpse at the depth of things we might discover about the people we love.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/books/review/the-moment-of-tenderness-by-madeleine-lengle-an-excerpt.html

It’s estimated that 20 million victory gardens flourished in the United States that year, and New York City alone produced 200 million pounds of tomatoes, beans, beets, carrots and lettuce. Seventy-seven years later, as millions of Americans are self-quarantined, and many worry about trips to the grocery store and the strength of the food-supply chain, the coronavirus pandemic has revived the victory-garden movement. “There is a simple, beautiful logic to having food security within your own home,” says David Godshall, the principal of the Los Angeles- and San Francisco-based landscape architecture studio Terremoto. “In my lifetime, I don’t think there’s ever been a more pertinent moment to start gardening.” For those wondering what will thrive in a limited outdoor space, the short answer is lots. A small garden on a rooftop or balcony can produce abundant harvests. Even inside, a sunny windowsill can yield fragrant clouds of herbs such as mint, lemon verbena, thyme, rosemary and Thai basil.

2020-04-23,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘The Willoughbys’ and ‘Will & Grace’,An animated adaptation of a Lois Lowry book is on Netflix. And “Will & Grace” comes to an end (again) on NBC.,"THE WILLOUGHBYS (2020) Stream on Netflix. “If you love stories about families that stick together and love each other through thick and thin, and it all ends happily ever after — this isn’t the film for you, OK?” That line is delivered by the narrator in the opening of this animated movie (the voice, fittingly, is Ricky Gervais’s). Adapted from a satirical children’s book by Lois Lowry, “The Willoughbys” concerns neglected siblings (voiced by Will Forte, Alessia Cara and Seán Cullen) who hatch a plan to get rid of their comically inattentive parents (Jane Krakowski and Martin Short). The ensuing story involves chases, betrayals and many nods to famous children’s books — including the presence of a friendly nanny (Maya Rudolph) and a candy man (Terry Crews). “Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review of the movie for The New York Times, “‘The Willoughbys’ thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-willoughbys-and-will-grace.html

2020-04-24,Two Exhibitions Respond to Art in the Age of Anxiety and Distance,"George Condo and Rashid Johnson talk about their new simultaneous digital shows, politics and how the role of artists has changed.","The artists George Condo and Rashid Johnson are old friends who both debuted new work in simultaneous online exhibitions for Hauser & Wirth gallery that opened last week. Condo, 62, first emerged in the early 1980s as a figurative painter whose portraits walked a line between realism and sardonic conceptualism. His new show, “Drawings for Distanced Figures,” explores how changes in perspective distort his subjects. Johnson, 42, first gained attention in the early 2000s for photographs, sculptures and paintings that explored identity in 21st-century America. His show, “Untitled Anxious Red Drawings,” revisits his “Anxious Men” figures — square-jawed faces with wide eyes and chattering teeth — which have become a staple of his work. (A portion of proceeds from both shows will benefit the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund.) Like everyone, both artists have had to adapt to a new set of circumstances in the last few months that has made them see their art — not to mention their respective creative processes — differently. This interview, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, took place via Google Hangouts (Condo and Johnson were both at “undisclosed locations on Long Island,” as Condo put it). The artists discussed producing art while sheltering in place, the virtues of online exhibitions and how they think the Covid-19 pandemic will change their profession.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/t-magazine/george-condo-rashid-johnson-art.html

2020-04-24,Revisiting the Posy in Our Current Moment,"Once thought to protect against disease, the small bouquets can at least provide a bit of beauty.","A little more than a month ago, as the pandemic was taking flight here in America, I found myself, like so many other nouveau preppers, cruising around my local grocery store in search of provisions. On my way to the checkout, I passed a tiered display of flowers and plants — funnel-shaped bouquets of carnations; potted pastel tulips; lone orchids, their delicate flamingo-neck stems held gracefully aloft — and was snagged by a flash of waxy green leaves and umbels of tiny magenta flowers. The plant was a Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, a blooming succulent that flowers in the winter months. “But I am here to buy coffee and Clorox wipes,” I told myself, as “My Misspent Youth” (1999), that Meghan Daum essay about going broke while buying fresh-cut flowers every week, flashed in my mind. And yet, at this sad moment, these bright cheerful blossoms hit me in the gut, stirring up a tangle of emotions: joy, hope, yearning for a time when I would have bought them without worrying they were frivolous, sadness for all the florists and vendors whose businesses are now shuttered. Suddenly I had to have them. The plant felt like a signifier of my past self, and a talisman against palpable, creeping despair.

John Logan, the creator behind the fantasy horror series “Penny Dreadful,” which ended in 2016, follows it up with this spinoff.
