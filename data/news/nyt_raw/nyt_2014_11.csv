(HBO) WINTER’S TALE (2014) The high-spirited consumptive daughter (Jessica Brown Findlay) of an early-20th-century mogul (William Hurt, above) is confronted by a thief (Colin Farrell) who breaks into her mansion to steal the silver — and absconds with her heart, aided by a flying white horse — in Akiva Goldsman’s adaptation of Mark Helprin’s 1983 best seller. Russell Crowe, rejoining Mr. Goldsman, the writer for “A Beautiful Mind,” is the gangster intent on putting their love asunder. “Mr. Goldsman, making his directing debut, suppresses the morbid and even the merely sad implications of the story in favor of wide-eyed, mystical wonder,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But “a thin line separates the magical from the preposterous, and by insisting so strenuously on its own magic, ‘Winter’s Tale’ pitches helplessly into earnest ridiculousness.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

John Spinello, above, inventor of what became Operation in 1965, is able to afford a $25,000 dental procedure because of a crowdfunding campaign begun by his fellow game inventors Tim Walsh and Peggy Brown. The campaign, which began Oct. 22 at crowdrise.com, raised over $31,000 by early Sunday. The experience, Mr. Spinello said by phone from Bloomington, Ill., has been “mind boggling.” “It’s really rewarding to have people calling me right now from all over the world,” he said. “You can’t put a price tag on it.” Mr. Spinello, 77, invented the buzzer game while studying industrial design at the University of Illinois. He sold his idea to a toy invention firm for $500, and it was then licensed to Milton Bradley. Through the years there have been various riffs on the character, including Homer Simpson, SpongeBob SquarePants and a version with 21st-century ailments like headphone headache and gamer’s thumb. Though Mr. Spinello still owns the patent for the game, he said he receives no royalties. In recent years, the recession hurt his trucking warehouse company, and he and his wife have filed for bankruptcy. In addition to the donations at Crowdrise, money has also been raised through the sale of signed copies of the game and $3 “Dear John” thank-you letters at iloveoperation.com. Hasbro, which owns Milton Bradley, has pitched in by agreeing to buy the original prototype from Mr. Spinello. Calls requesting comment from Hasbro were not returned. Mr. Spinello said he hoped any leftover money would go to saving his home. But, he added, he would be grateful for “a decent smile and the ability to chew.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/arts/man-behind-operation-needs-one-himself.html

The Montpelier Foundation announced on Saturday that the money would be used to further restore the mansion to its original 1817 appearance and provide more context about the lives of Madison’s slaves. Part of the gift, $3.5 million, will support reconstruction of the mansion’s south yard, where the family’s domestic servants lived and worked. The plans include three slave quarters, two smokehouses and a detached kitchen. The rest of the money will go toward restoring, researching and refurnishing the home, including purchasing items authentic to the time period or the home; much of what was there has been dispersed over the years through family members or sales. Dolley Madison sold the property in 1844 after her husband’s death, and Montpelier had various owners until it was purchased in 1901 by William duPont.

Over the weekend, as the Republican advantage seemed to solidify, a number of writers made the point that the G.O.P. could probably win the Senate without making the kind of inroads that would bode well for their chances of winning the White House (or even keeping the Senate) two years hence. This year’s midterm map is unusually unrepresentative of the country as a whole, the Washington Post’s Patrick Egan noted, and so tonight’s outcomes don’t tell us that much about the future; the G.O.P. is winning more on second-term disillusionment than on any positive vision or agenda, two the party’s pollsters argued in the same newspaper, and isn’t showing any signs of expanding the electoral map into blue territory. The upshot (if you will) of these patterns, my colleague Nate Cohn suggested, is that Republicans are poised to retake the Senate without winning over “many voters who supported President Obama in 2012″ — an outcome that would indicate they’ve “made little progress in attracting voters they would need to take back the White House.”",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/for-republicans-what-counts-as-victory/

That said, here are some things to consider if you’re visiting Amsterdam, Madrid, Florence or Paris.","Visit the tourism office in any major city in Europe and you’ll most likely find an offer to purchase a museum pass – a card that gives the holder entry to multiple local museums. Some passes include additional perks – priority entrance, discounts at monuments, free use of public transportation – but the high prices have always left me skeptical: These passes are marketed to tourists as a way to save money, but how many museums do you need to visit before you’ve recouped the cost of the pass? And were all of those museums already on your itinerary? To determine if the passes really are bargains, I examined the offers in four museum-dense European cities popular with travelers: Amsterdam, Madrid, Florence and Paris. So what’s the verdict on these supposed money-savers?

He was interested in recording everything he could.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/andy-warhol-films-bam-next-wave-festival/

Tahar Rahim plays Samir, the man Marie has taken up with, whose wife is in a coma.

And Pauline Burlet is Marie’s older daughter, who finds the situation nearly intolerable. “The narrative complications can be distracting, at times exasperating, but they’re finally irrelevant because Mr. Farhadi’s filmmaking is so fluid, and the performers, Ms. Bejo, in particular, are so attractive,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “As in ‘A Separation,’ Mr. Farhadi shows a masterly gift for moving his characters and camera through rooms that — with a raised voice, a violent exit — become stages in a ferocious domestic drama.

In 1989, while working for the Soviet military as a cryptographer, he discovered a virus in his computer and began to study and treat it. He did the same for another colleague who had found a virus in his computer. By 1991, Kaspersky had moved to a private company, where he and his colleagues developed a program called AntiViral Toolkit Pro. That was the prototype for what became the Kaspersky Anti-Virus, now sold by Kaspersky Lab, the company that he founded in 1997. Based in Moscow, the company now has 30 regional offices and works in nearly 200 countries. The company became a sponsor in Formula One with the Ferrari team in 2010 and has expanded into one of the team’s major sponsors and technical partners. Kaspersky’s software is used in the Ferrari computer system and he plans additional projects within the series. Kaspersky is a racing fan and he occasionally drives sports cars on racetracks for fun.

Their work is rarely glamorous, and especially for those just starting out in the profession, it can be grinding and repetitive. Jason Luckasevic, hired out of law school in 2000 by a firm in Pittsburgh, passed the bar exam on his first try and was quickly sworn in to practice. The ceremony, such as it was, took place on a Thursday in a clerk’s office, rather than in a courtroom in front of family and friends, because his bosses needed him to get started. The following Monday morning, he drove to Johnstown, about 90 minutes away, where he spent the day taking depositions from former employees of an enormous steel plant that had exposed them to asbestos. Late that afternoon, he climbed back into his Honda Civic and headed home. He repeated this routine for the next six months, five days a week, racking up some 400 depositions and about 20,000 miles on the road.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/how-one-lawyers-crusade-could-change-football-forever.html

2014-11-06,B. J. Novak’s ‘Book With No Pictures’ and More,Five picture books directly address young readers with unconventional storytelling.,"Have your kids gone meta? Do they call their neighborhood jungle gym a “play structure”? Do they mix and match their dress-up garb — a tiara here, firefighter’s boots there — with a sense of mischief that might, unnervingly, be termed “ironic”? Have they spotted the clown at the neighbor’s birthday party removing his wig and slinking out the side door? They’re probably not ready for the labyrinthine tricksterism of David Foster Wallace or Spike Jonze. But on the evidence of a recent spate of highly self-conscious picture books, it would seem that the suspended-disbelief state of early childhood is adapting to the wink-wink, nudge-nudge sensibility of our moment. It’s not surprising. There has long been a strain of subversion in picture books — think of Maurice Sendak and Tomi Ungerer, among others — alongside the dominant anodyne snuggliness of the form. Now, sophisticated cheekiness appears to have gone mainstream. These five specimens of reinvention deftly pop the bubbles of their own illusory worlds, drawing attention to the artifices of their norms and aiming to teach children to become not just book lovers but pint-size “consumers of text.” The best of these books, luckily, manage to find fresh magic in demystification, and to delight kids while spinning the heads of their grown-up companions.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/b-j-novaks-book-with-no-pictures-and-more.html

Its cherrywood bar stretched half a block and was lit by a hundred electric lights. With Anderson’s encouragement, high-class brothels were soon flourishing down Basin Street. Josie Arlington, his business partner, had a four-story Victorian mansion with a domed cupola, mirrored parlor and Oriental statues. The exotic, mixed-race Lulu White built a brick palace that specialized in interracial sex and featured the jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton at the piano. Another octoroon (the appellation given to people considered to be one-eighth black), Willie V. Piazza, passed herself off as a countess and sported both a monocle and a diamond choker. Anderson, whose civic spirit earned him the title “the Mayor of Storyville,” published a Blue Book that contained photos and descriptions of the area’s better prostitutes, annotated with symbols (“w” for white, “c” for colored, “J” for Jewish and “oct.” for octoroon).

On one level, the book is about duality: As Jude and Noah wrangle over who will go to a prestigious art school and vie for attention and approbation and even, for a short time, the affections of the same boy, each narrator struggles to become whole, to become something other than merely half of one. Although Nelson portrays the relationship between the twins, their oneness, as comforting, more often it is claustrophobic — perhaps contributing to the book’s tense, almost breathless feel. One of their favorite games is to divide up the world between them, choosing and bartering the sun or the trees or the oceans.

The absence of color holds your eye (black-and-white has become a palette for gimmicks and obscure auteurs), as do several arcs traced by the camera, as if that visitor were looking up and even searching. The camera movements seem familiar not only because they mirror the physical effort of what it’s like to tilt your head and stretch your neck, to gape up at a cathedral window or gathering clouds, but also because they evoke Terrence Malick.

Putin has revised his opinion of an important piece of Soviet history, calling the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that Moscow signed with Nazi Germany to divide up Eastern Europe not so bad. “The Soviet Union signed a nonaggression treaty with Germany,” Mr. Putin said during a meeting with historians on Wednesday, according to a Russian transcript of the meeting that the Kremlin released Thursday. “People say: ‘Ach, that’s bad.’ But what’s bad about that if the Soviet Union didn’t want to fight? What’s bad about it?” While the Soviet Union is accused of dividing Poland, he said, Poland actually seized part of Czechoslovakia when Germany attacked that country. “Serious research should show that those were the methods of foreign policy then,” Mr. Putin said. Five years ago he had called the very same pact “immoral.” The statement is likely to increase security concerns in Eastern European states, which have been jittery about Russia’s intentions ever since it seized Crimea in March. Mr. Putin signed a law in May mandating five years imprisonment for anyone convicted of trying to rehabilitate Nazism.

The settlement followed a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by a former Biotronik employee, Brian Sant, who said that the company had induced physicians to use its pacemakers and defibrillators through methods like paying them inflated fees to serve on a company advisory board. The company did not acknowledge wrongdoing. In 2011, The New York Times published an article documenting an unusual pattern in the growth of Biotronik devices in some Western states. In Las Vegas, for example, the article reported that surgeons at a major hospital switched to using almost exclusively the company’s devices soon after being put on its payroll as consultants.

From guns concealed by a haystack they inflicted enormous damage on the town, but late in the afternoon the Germans met with summary punishment in a way for which they were completely unprepared. The puffing of a steam-engine warned them as they thought of the approach of a troop train. They waited their opportunity, expecting it to pass a section of the railway which was visible to them nearly two miles away. Their opportunity never came. They simply heard the terrific crash of the heavy guns, and within a few seconds they and their guns ceased to exist. The enemy had been surprised by an armored train — the first which the British had sent to the firing line. The armored train has now supported our artillery for several days. Its casualties up to date consist of one man wounded. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Nov. 8, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/1914-armored-train-surprise/

They’re in the middle of a shipping route, and yet no one has passed them, no rescue is in sight. “I want you to write me a world in which that happens,” one of the friends asks the television writer on the boat. It’s a grim scene. They’re running out of food, they can’t sleep or stretch out, and old tensions between the men have started to renew. The television writer creates an origin story for their predicament: a “coup d’état” in Canada, hostages, armed gunmen. He names the imaginary show “Man v. Nature.” “Everything is man versus this and man versus that,” he says. “It’s so simple. . . . It’s man versus everything. It’s me. It’s you. It’s us.

But it may have reached its happy apotheosis with “The Secret History of Wonder Woman,” new at No. 12 on the hardcover nonfiction list, by the Harvard historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore. “It struck me that Wonder Woman’s origin story borrows from all the conventions of feminist utopian fiction,” Lepore said in a recent interview with Comic Book Resource (“the premier online comics magazine”). “I had never noticed that tie before, and I don’t think comics fans or comics historians necessarily noticed it, either — mainly because there’s not a great deal of overlap between comics historians and readers of feminist utopian fiction.” Among other things, Lepore’s book traces the pervasive bondage scenes in “Wonder Woman” to suffragist politics, and locates the comic at an important point on the timeline of feminism. “People often think of the women’s rights movement as having taken place in waves,” she told Comic Book Resource. “There’s a first wave that ends with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, and a second wave that begins in the ’60s, and in between those two waves, it’s as if there’s nothing going on. But once you lift the veil on the secret history of Wonder Woman, right there in the middle in the 1940s, there’s Wonder Woman, inspired by the feminism of the first half of the century, and an inspiration for the feminism in the second half.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/books/review/inside-the-list.html

During the course of Ronan’s life, I wrote constantly, often through the night, gripped by a need to understand a world in which such suffering was possible; and also to try to mitigate my helplessness and despair by giving myself something to do. “Gabriel: A Poem” — part tribute; part existential howl; part intellectual investigation of our most primal emotions; part novella-like, buoyant, unsentimental romp through the life of Hirsch’s “wild spirit beloved son” — is the kind of wrenching, meticulous study of grief I craved at that time.

How, for all its ­miraculous-seeming benefits, automation also can and often does impair our mental and physical skills, cause dreadful mistakes and accidents, particularly in medicine and aviation, and threaten to turn the algorithms we create as servants into our mindless masters — what sci-fi movies have been warning us about for at least two or three decades now.

Parson Mason Weems’s “Life of Washington” rolled off the presses in Philadelphia in 1800, mere months after the death of the father of our country, with Weems’s stated goal to inspire young Americans to emulate the great man’s shining example. We have that book to thank for the compelling image of the rambunctious 6-year-old George chopping down his father’s best cherry tree, then fessing up to his misdeed with the immortal words: “I cannot tell a lie.” The irrepressible parson, we now know, invented the scene out of whole cloth, which is certainly a tad ironic. Yet less cavalier authors than Weems have wrestled with the question of whether, or to what extent in the seemingly special case of a biography for young readers, a touch-up job might be in order. The 1940 Caldecott Medal winner, “Abraham Lincoln,” by Ingri and Edgar Parin d’Aulaire, ends with an illustration of the weary president resting contentedly in a favorite rocker, the Civil War having just come to a successful conclusion.

Plato, not the most liberal of men, suggested that the work of storytellers should be carefully examined “and what they do well we must pass and what not, reject.” His purpose was to moralize literature; others, over the centuries, have offered equally noble motives. Ibn Khaldun, the great Arab historian, reported that in the seventh century, when Muslim soldiers invaded Persia, they discovered an extraordinary number of books; wishing to carry them off as loot, they asked Omar bin al-Khattab, second caliph of the Muslims, for permission. Omar’s answer became legendary and was applied to other book destructions: “Throw them in the river! If they hold a guide to the Truth, God has given us a better guide in the Holy Quran. And if they hold nothing but lies, may God rid us of them.” In our own time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forced Google and Twitter to remove content objected to by his government or risk blackouts, arguing that “these regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the Internet. . . .

That said, “100 Sideways Miles,” which was a semifinalist for a National Book Award, is more interior and profound than its predecessors, and possibly more beguiling.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/100-sideways-miles-by-andrew-smith.html
2014-11-07,"‘Arcady’s Goal,’ by Eugene Yelchin","For Eugene Yelchin’s young hero, athletic prowess becomes a means of surviving Stalinist oppression.","Any historical event, examined from the right perspective, can resemble a children’s story. In “Arcady’s Goal,” an immensely rewarding novel by Eugene Yelchin, the protagonist’s parents are devoured in much the way the parents are devoured in “James and the Giant Peach.” Only instead of a rhino, it’s Stalin. And instead of the boy being made to live in the house of his mean aunts, he’s sent to a home for the offspring of “enemies of the state.” At the risk of seeming to equate the evils of the 20th century with the fiction of Roald Dahl: If you were born, say, in the early 2000s, the fate of a boy like Arcady might seem just as strange and unreal as anything cooked up by a fabulist from the middle of the last century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/arcadys-goal-by-eugene-yelchin.html
2014-11-07,A Manual for Life,The author credits the official guide of the Boy Scouts of America for his secondary education.,"I read only two books cover to cover during high school. The first was Owen Wister’s “The Virginian,” which I found gathering dust in the parlor of the old Wilson house on Charleston Street in Mobile, Ala. Wister, along with issues of Collier’s, Life magazine, Reader’s Digest and the yellow-tinted Mobile Press-Register, made up the household literature. There was a public library a few blocks north of us on Government Street, but I never thought of going there. Libraries were not part of the culture in which I was raised.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/a-manual-for-life.html
2014-11-07,Jane Smiley’s ‘Some Luck’,"Jane Smiley’s novel, the first in a planned trilogy, follows an Iowa family over three transformative decades in America.","Before Marilynne Robinson’s Iowa, there was Jane Smiley’s. While Robinson, already revered as the author of “Housekeeping,” was taking a long pause from publishing to teach at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, Smiley wrote “A Thousand Acres,” a story of an Iowa farm family in extremis that won the Pulitzer Prize. While Robinson was writing “Gilead,” her own Pulitzer winner, and two subsequent novels about Iowa church people and their descendants, Smiley was shaking off the Heartland-Author tag with novels about real estate and tax evasion (“Good Faith”), Hollywood (“Ten Days in the Hills”) and a military wife transplanted from Missouri to San Francisco (“Private Life”). With a short biography of Dickens, she invited us to see her, like him, as a writer whose work is defined by its energy and range rather than its settings and subject matter. With a whistle-stop tour of 100 novels (“Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel”), she lined up with Henry James and John Updike as a writer who offsets her own fiction with spot-on commentary about other people’s work. So it’s appropriate to turn to “Some Luck” — the first novel in a projected trilogy about Iowa farm people and their descendants — by way of Smiley’s critical insights.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/jane-smiley-some-luck-review.html
2014-11-07,"‘As an Oak Tree Grows,’ and More","Three picture books appeal to children’s fascination with trees, providing information and flights of imagination.","A few years ago, we had a young neighbor who, walking to school, would stop by her favorite trees and ask what kind of morning they were having, maybe chat for a bit. She was a regular second grader and she talked to trees. I don’t think she’s the only one. Trees have always played a central role in the lives and minds of our species. Researchers tell us that surgical patients heal faster when their windows look out on trees and children do better in school when they can see green spaces. When the famous Treaty Oak in Austin, Tex., was poisoned in 1989, kids made hundreds of cards and placed them under the tree. Not all kids live near historic oaks, but most care about trees, and wonder about them. Books about trees speak to that wondering.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/as-an-oak-tree-grows-and-more.html
2014-11-07,Johanna Skibsrud’s ‘Quartet for the End of Time’,"From Washington to Paris, four interwoven characters grapple with guilt and injustice.","Incarcerated in the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag VIII-A in 1940, the French composer Olivier Messiaen set down what he called “Quatuor Pour la Fin du Temps,” the “Quartet for the End of Time.” It was first performed in January 1941 before a freezing audience of prisoners and German guards. The reception was said to have been respectful if bemused. As the critic Alex Ross later explained: “By 1941, this composer no longer wanted to hear time being beaten out by a drum — one, two, three, four; he had had enough of that in the war. Instead, he devised rhythms that expanded, contracted, stopped in their tracks and rolled back in symmetrical patterns.” The quartet, Ross observed, is “the most ethereally beautiful music of the 20th century.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/johanna-skibsruds-quartet-for-the-end-of-time.html

But Christopher Paul Curtis’s “The Madman of Piney Woods” did just that. Again and again, I doubted that what would happen next would be O.K. for young and old readers alike. Yet at every turn of this middle-grade novel, a “companion book” to the Newbery Honor-winning “Elijah of Buxton,” Curtis deftly makes what might have been simply heart-rending hopeful and redeeming instead.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/christopher-paul-curtiss-madman-of-piney-woods.html

To the unworldly, the average working person of Latin American descent looks like an “illegal alien.” For decades Latino comedians have been making satirical commentary on the absurdity (and cruelty) of using the same word to describe people with Spanish surnames and slimy creatures from other worlds, and now William Alexander has given us a middle-grade novel that stretches out the joke for an entire book. Alexander, who won a National Book Award for his 2012 novel “Goblin Secrets,” merges the fantastic with the ­everyday to create an engaging and smart allegory about the hurt and strangeness of the modern immigrant condition.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/ambassador-and-lowriders-in-space.html

The authors are describing Schmidt’s first years as C.E.O., when the board of directors was consumed with worry about its most formidable competitor, Microsoft. Back then Google employees, the authors write, referred to their archrival by a secret code name: “Finland.” It seems like a fresh if somewhat inexplicable detail, until the eye wanders down to the bottom of the page and this disclaimer: “In fact, ‘Finland’ is a code name for the code name we actually used. If we used the actual code name in this book, it wouldn’t be much of a code name, would it?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/how-google-works-by-eric-schmidt-and-jonathan-rosenberg.html

The challenges they face are many, and their chances of survival, let alone success, are low. Though these worker bees occasionally bond with others of their ilk, they’re really on their own, forever outrunning the authority figures who regularly swoop down to assess their accomplishments and mete out punishment accordingly. The stakes are high: If the denizens of this universe fail, they’ll be dropped into the black hole of obscurity where, unless they can claw their way out, they’ll languish forever.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/afterworlds-by-scott-westerfeld.html
2014-11-07,‘The Doubt Factory’ and ‘Love Is the Drug’,Two young adult thrillers exploit the conventions of genre to offer head-on critiques of today’s political landscape.,"To be a teenager is to be acutely aware of power, in all its forms — by virtue of having so frustratingly little of it. Which means adolescent protagonists impose a limiting factor on political fiction. Young adult authors looking to vent their political spleen commonly circumvent this with one of two routes: They embrace George Eliot’s reminder that “there is no private life which has not been determined by a wider public life,” filtering political exigencies through the lens of personal experience and mapping out the Machiavellian power plays of home and high school. Or they turn to science fiction and fantasy and play politics to their heart’s content: There’s no believability ceiling to how teenagers in futuristic societies can change their worlds.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/books/review/the-doubt-factory-and-love-is-the-drug.html

In some states, like Iowa, Democratic areas report their votes first, making the Democrat seem ahead even when he’s not. In other states, like Virginia, the opposite is true. That’s why we introduced a new way to watch election returns this year — with vote counts adjusted for geography — and we’re deeply gratified by the response from readers and other analysts.",The Upshot,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/upshot/letter-from-the-editor-the-story-of-culpeper.html

(Showtime) AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY A dysfunctional clan unfurls its secrets as it gathers to mourn the loss of its patriarch in this dark comedy, directed by John Wells and adapted by Tracy Letts from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Sam Shepard portrays Beverly Weston, an alcoholic poet living in a rambling farmhouse in northeastern Oklahoma who hires a Native American caretaker (Misty Upham) for his shrill, pill-addicted wife, Violet (Meryl Streep) — and then disappears. Julia Roberts, Ms. Nicholson and Ms. Lewis and play Beverly and Violet’s daughters; Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney and Benedict Cumberbatch are the men in their lives. And Margo Martindale and Chris Cooper are Violet’s sister and brother-in-law, who are there to lend support. But the story of the Weston family “is secondary to the spectacle the actors make of themselves,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, calling the film “a thespian cage match” in which “a bunch of unquestionably talented performers is assembled with no instructions other than to top one another.” He added, “It goes without saying that nobody can beat Ms. Streep at this game.” (She received an Oscar nomination, as did Ms. Roberts.) “But everyone joins in.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Mr. Childs said the goal was to record at least 100 interviews to be made available to the public online in the next six to 12 months. “It’s important to do because these people are dying every day,” Mr. Childs said in a phone interview. “It’s a race against the clock, but we’re getting them.” He said that he was in talks with several universities and foundations to host the videos but that it was too early to name the candidates.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/theater/oral-history-project-at-primary-stages.html

2014-11-09,Pooh Illustrations to Be Auctioned,"How many honey pots could a silly old bear fill if he had 100,000 British pounds, or roughly $159,000?","How many honey pots could a silly old bear fill if he had 100,000 British pounds, or roughly $159,000? That’s the low estimate for an original illustration from A. A. Milne’s 1928 book “The House at Pooh Corner” to be sold at Sotheby’s London next month. The drawing, signed by the artist E. H. Shepard, depicts Winnie-the-Pooh playing a game of “Poohsticks” on a bridge with Christopher Robin and Piglet. It has been part of a private collection since 1975, according to the Sotheby’s London sale catalog. The illustration is expected to fetch £100,000 to £150,000, or about $159,000 to $238,000, and is one of several drawings by Shepard that the auction house will feature at its “English Literature, History, Children’s Books and Illustration” sale on Dec. 9. Other items include drawings by Beatrix Potter and Edmund Dulac, a copy of “Peter Pan” signed by J. M. Barrie, and presentation copies of uncorrected “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” proofs signed by J. K. Rowling. Pooh has proved to be a lucrative draw at previous auctions. In November 2008, an original Shepard sketch of Pooh and friends sold for about $50,100 at a Bonham’s auction. A month later, the Stanley J. Seeger and Christopher Cone collection of Shepard’s original drawings for the Winnie-the-Pooh books brought in about $1.97 million at a Sotheby’s London auction.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/arts/design/pooh-illustrations-to-be-auctioned.html

The Floyd, as they were known, provided audiences with a complete sensory experience, pairing visceral, operatic lyrics with elaborate light projections that seemed to move in turn to the music. And even as they achieved global popularity in the 1970s with a string of landmark albums including 1973’s “The Dark Side of the Moon,” 1975’s “Wish You Were Here” and 1979’s “The Wall,” the band remained focused on bringing visual ideas to the forefront through their live shows and iconic album art.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/pink-floyd-influence-on-artists/

William Tecumseh Sherman, who ordered the city torched. “It was like fiddling over the burning of Rome.” The next morning, nothing was left of the city “except its churches the city hall and the private dwellings.

The column didn’t say much about whether either man was likely to actually win the nomination, mostly because I don’t think that much has changed since the last time I wrote about the two of them: Rubio still looks more like the kind of candidate who wins G.O.P. nominations, an asset that the press may be underrating the moment, while Paul still has the harder road (probably slightly more difficult now given the shifting foreign policy landscape), because he just has more potential points of tension with the traditional Republican coalition, donors and wonks and voters alike.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/miscellaneous-thoughts-on-2016/

I was enthralled not just by the story of the lonely boy and his mysterious balloon companion but also — and perhaps even more — by the photography. Each page of the book is a still from the movie, a thrillingly lucid, beautifully stylized window into the real world. The photos were of Paris, not fancy Paris but the gray, gray Paris of crumbling buildings and dim alleyways. The camera made each pockmarked wall look like an elaborate Modernist painting, with the little boy dressed in soft dove-gray himself a lovely detail in it — and then set against all the grayness on each page was that miraculous balloon. It glided across the scene, redder than any red and bigger than any balloon I’d ever seen, a beacon of pure joy and a testament to the possibility that a bit of magic could float right into your tough everyday life.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/books/review/this-equals-that-and-mister-horizontal-miss-vertical.html

If it worked, the sugar-sensitive version could transform the lives of the six million people with diabetes in the United States who use insulin. No longer would they have to test their blood-sugar levels multiple times per day and try to calculate how much insulin to take. The self-regulating insulin would curtail high sugar levels, which raise the risk of long-term complications, and eradicate, or at least reduce, the most dangerous short-term complication: hypoglycemia, when sugar levels fall so low that they can cause confusion, unconsciousness, seizures and even death.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/why-are-there-so-few-new-drugs-invented-today.html

Notes Split in Red Bloc,From the International Herald Tribune archives: the C.I.A. chief discussed the Soviets in 1964.,"WASHINGTON — Central Intelligence Agency Director John A. McCone said last night [Nov. 14] that the “depth of the schism” between the Soviet Union and Communist China is greater than generally believed and that “the problems of repairing it appear insurmountable.” In his first public address since taking office more than three years ago, Mr. McCone admitted that the fall of Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was “a distinct surprise to us.” But he also said the ouster was an equal surprise to the Soviet party Presidium. “They didn’t know they had the strength to remove him until they sat down to their final meeting on Oct. 14,” Mr. McCone said. The C.I.A. director gave his agency credit for predicting Communist China’s first nuclear explosion “almost to the day.” To defeat the ultrasophisticated security apparatus in every Communist country, he said, required the use of highly refined technical devices. In analyzing recent events in the Soviet Union, Mr. McCone said the Russian people resented their government’s tremendous expenditure on military hardware while they were forced to go without. He said this internal problem was ‘‘created by the Soviets’ spending beyond their resources.” — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Nov. 16, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/1964-c-i-a-notes-split-in-red-bloc/

I can testify to that after my visit last month to the groovy downtown Manhattan offices of Relevent, a marketing agency that has created a virtual-reality demo for HBO to help promote its hit series “Game of Thrones.” Without much small talk, Ian Cleary, Relevent’s vice president of “innovation and ideation,” escorted me into a steampunk cage the size of a phone booth, made of iron and wood. He fitted me with headphones and the Oculus Rift, as the company’s flagship product is called, a blocky set of black maxigoggles with an internal screen positioned inches from the eyes. I promptly lost awareness of the screen, and after a few seconds, a bass speaker under the floorboards began to boom. All I knew next was that I was shooting up, as in an outdoor elevator, to a windy summit and then trudging through lightly packed snow — crunch, crunch, crunch — onto a vertiginous ledge of ice.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/virtual-reality-fails-its-way-to-success.html

Skip escorts his client to the precise latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, where she catches her soon-to-be-ex in flagrante delicto. Case closed.

In the issue’s centerpiece, authors including Philip Roth, George Saunders, Marilynne Robinson and Lydia Davis revisit, in candid prose, the circumstances and motivations that shaped some of their greatest works. (They also share annotated pages from those books — a sampling of a December auction of annotated first editions by 75 authors to benefit the PEN American Center, the range of which can be seen on T’s website.) Next, we celebrate the master decorator Robert Kime, whom we encounter at his picturesque farmhouse in the north of England; Rita Konig tours the property and gets a firsthand look at the English eclecticism that Kime has brought to his high-profile clients’ homes for decades. The polymath Danish artist Olafur Eliasson opens the doors to his sprawling studio in a converted brewery in Berlin and explains how art is just one of the ways — along with politics, philanthropy and cooking — he hopes to change the world. Elsewhere, Cathy Horyn answers the question, “To fast or feast?” by doing both in Germany’s Black Forest; Andrew O’Hagan opines that, yes, life really is better in the iPhone age; Christine Smallwood puzzles over a bizarre new theme park in Rome dedicated to Italian film; and one of T’s very own editors explores New York City on three wheels in an ode to the trusty and stylish, if oft-forgotten, tricycle.

New rounds of vaccination will be conducted in December in both areas. The two paralysis cases in South Sudan were in a displaced-persons camp where revaccination is relatively easy, the W.H.O. said, while testing suggests that the one case in Madagascar did not spread far. “Vaccine-derived polio paralysis” is a rare but small risk inherent in oral vaccine, so the polio eradication campaign is trying to introduce injectable vaccine wherever it is safe and practical. The injectable vaccine contains a “killed” virus that cannot mutate. But it provides less protection than the live, weakened virus in oral vaccine, is more expensive and is much harder to give.

Second came his wife, Marie-Hortense Fiquet (1850-1922). The exhibition “Madame Cézanne,” opening Wednesday and running through March 15 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will present 23 of the 29 images of her that Cézanne is known to have made. They don’t give much away. Far from idealized as a woman or a beloved mate, she usually appears stiffly reserved, a dignified enigma. In fact, not a lot is known about her. She was 19 and working as a part-time artist’s model when he, 11 years older, met her and started an affair that produced a child, Paul (1872-1947). Cézanne kept the relationship and the child a secret from his wealthy parents for fear of their disapproval but eventually married Hortense, in 1886. His letters to friends suggest that he regarded her as a shallow and irritating person. He excluded her from his will, leaving everything to their son. Yet he painted her repeatedly over more than 20 years. Go figure. (212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.) ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/arts/design/czannes-muse-at-least-on-canvas.html

Depression Quest, created by the developers Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey and Isaac Schankler, isn’t what most people think of as a video game at all. For starters, it isn’t very fun. Its real value is as an educational tool, or an exercise in empathy. Aside from occasional fuzzy Polaroid pictures that appear at the top of the screen, Depression Quest is a purely text-based game that proceeds from screen to screen through simple hyperlinks, inviting players to step into the shoes of a person suffering from clinical depression. After reading brief vignettes about what the main character is struggling with — at home, at work, in relationships — you try to make choices that steer your character out of this downward spiral. The most important choices are those the game prevents you from making, unclickable choices with red lines through them, saying things like “Shake off your funk.” As your character falls deeper into depression, more options are crossed out. You can’t sleep; you can’t call a therapist; you can’t explain how you feel to the people you love.

Marilyn B. Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in September that 7.3 million people were enrolled. But Bloomberg News reported Thursday that the figure included nearly 400,000 people with stand-alone dental plans, prompting the administration to revise the enrollment figure to 6.7 million as of Oct. 15. The discrepancy was discovered by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which had asked for the enrollment records. About eight million people had signed up for health plans by May, according to the administration, but many are no longer enrolled. At the time, the Health and Human Services Department broke out the number who had signed up for dental but not medical plans, saying that 1.1 million people had done so. In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services said it still estimated that a total of 9.1 million people would have medical coverage through the exchanges by the end of next year. “The mistake we made is unacceptable,” Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the department’s secretary, wrote on Twitter.

2014-11-21,Inside the List,"Richard Ford, whose latest Frank Bascombe book is on the extended hardcover fiction list, had originally named his character Frank Slocum.","Né Slocum: Richard Ford’s story collection “Let Me Be Frank With You” — No. 17 on the extended hardcover fiction list after debuting last week at No. 14 — is his fourth book to feature Frank Bascombe, following three novels: “The Sportswriter” (1986), “Independence Day” (1995) and “The Lay of the Land” (2006). By now, in other words, Bascombe is as familiar as your next-door neighbor, having staked his place not just in suburban New Jersey but in contemporary literature. So I was startled to learn, while talking to Ford at an event last spring, that the character was originally named not Bascombe but Slocum. “I had a working notion,” Ford explained in a follow-up email, “that Frank was figuratively a man sailing alone around the world — like Joshua Slocum, who wrote ‘Sailing Alone Around the World,’ a book I loved.” But when Ford sent his manuscript for “The Sportswriter” to the poet Donald Hall, a longtime friend and mentor, Hall reminded him that Joseph Heller’s novel “Something Happened” also had a protagonist named Slocum. “So I was stuck,” Ford said, “with a finished novel narrated by a character I didn’t have a name for. This was very vexing, I hardly need say. I’d always felt a character’s name was totemic.” Ford set out to rechristen his protagonist, deconstructing “Slocum” and deciding he required a two-syllable, trochaic name that emphasized its vowels rather than its consonants. “I had a friend who had a middle name that was like Bascombe,” he said, “but I didn’t want to steal my friend’s name. So I rejiggered it into Bascombe — a name I’d never heard before but that sounded persuasive. I was actually surprised at how easily I made the transition from one loyalty to another. It was instructive.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The White House also declined to make some of the other moves — involving agricultural workers and others — that were bruited in advance; it did expand the existing DACA program itself by changing age limits and moving the eligibility date for arrival from 2007 to 2010, but that’s just a further exercise of a power that the White House had already claimed.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/three-thoughts-on-an-amnesty/

One of the plants is in Austin, Minn., the other in Fremont, Neb.; and both produce meat for the inexpensive, highly processed edible product known as Spam. In “The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of Our Food,” Ted Genoways describes in appalling detail what goes into that Spam. The ingredients on the label — pork with ham, salt, water, modified potato starch, sugar and sodium nitrite — may sound harmless. But Genoways argues that the industrial system behind those little cans is inextricably linked to a variety of social problems: animal cruelty, water pollution, food-borne illness, worker exploitation, a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, government corruption and largely unchecked corporate power. Once celebrated with some irony by Monty Python, “lovely Spam, wonderful Spam” looms as a sinister force in “The Chain,” a hidden source of misery in the nation’s heartland.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/books/review/the-chain-by-ted-genoways.html

What happens when a novel whose scenes of coprophagia and pedophilia moved Pulitzer trustees to cancel the prize in 1974 (when Pynchon seemed poised to win) eases into middle-aged, canonical respectability? Well, for one thing, it gets an audiobook release. Since the mid-1980s, a George Guidall recording has been floating around, like some mythical lost rocket part — no one had heard it, but all Pynchon fans knew someone who knew someone who had — but in October a new version, authorized and rerecorded and burned onto 30 compact discs — hit the stands. How on earth, I wondered as I stripped the wrapper, is poor Mr. Guidall going to render the sudden outbreaks of crazed capitals, or librettos in which stoners with guitars pastiche Rossini, the instructions helpfully stating “(bubububoo[oo] oo [sung to opening of Beethoven 5th, with full band])”? He turns out to do it in a slow and deep-voiced manner, beneath whose calm avuncularity you can detect anxiety, even mania, bubbling but never quite erupting — although I could have sworn I heard him, in the silence at the end of CD 30, racing out the door to buy a year’s supply of those Thayer’s Slippery Elm Throat Lozenges the hero Slothrop sucks, or perhaps to check himself into the book’s White Visitation mental hospital.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/books/review/gravitys-rainbow-read-by-george-guidall.html

2014-11-22,"V.F.W. Goes Gender-Neutral, Recognizing Female Veterans ",The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has won congressional approval to alter the wording of its charter to recognize female veterans.," When the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States secured its congressional charter in 1936, “veterans” were usually men and the spouses of those who fell in battle were “widows.” That, of course, is now very different. (Indeed, even during World War II several hundred thousand women served in the United States military, including nurses and members of the Women’s Army Corps.) Now, more than 15 percent of active-duty United States service members are female. So the V.F.W. is changing, too, winning congressional approval to alter the wording of its charter. No longer is it “a national association of men” who served in wartime; it is one of “veterans.” And it is no longer to assist “widows” — rather, “surviving spouses.” The changes, approved at the national convention, were made in bills just passed by the House and Senate. “We didn’t change our congressional charter to be politically correct,” the V.F.W. National Commander, John W. Stroud, said in a statement. “We changed it because being an eligible service member or veteran is what’s important to our great organization, not one’s gender.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/us/vfw-goes-gender-neutral-recognizing-female-veterans.html

The statement said cases had been reported in seven regions, including the capital, Antananarivo, raising the “risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city’s high population density and the weakness of the health care system.” Efforts to combat the outbreak, the statement said, have been hampered because fleas, the primary spreader of the disease, have developed resistance to an insecticide used to kill them.",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/world/africa/madagascar-plague-outbreak-kills-40.html

Christensen had prosecuted more sexual-assault courts-martial than any other lawyer in the Air Force, and this case called for someone with experience. There would most likely be generals testifying. The accused himself was a senior officer. Even Christensen had seldom handled cases involving men of high rank.

Like Ismail Kadare, he is a student at the Gorky Institute for World Literature in Moscow in the late 1950s. He tells someone he’s writing a book about “a dead army commanded by a living general” — an allusion to Kadare’s 1963 novel, “The General of the Dead Army,” in which an Italian officer returns to Albania after the Second World War to disinter the bones of his soldiers. He’s also obsessed with the Albanian legend of Konstandin and Doruntine, which goes like this: When his sister Doruntine marries and moves far away, Konstandin promises his mother he will ride to fetch her for weddings and funerals; when he and all his brothers are killed, his ghost does the job, delivers his sister to the church and leaves her at the gate, saying, “You go on, I have something to do here.” This story would be the basis for Kadare’s novel “The Ghost Rider,” and by the end of “Twilight of the Eastern Gods” the narrator has become a sort of Konstandin figure himself. The Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha’s schism from the U.S.S.R. is occurring, and the narrator knows his days in Moscow are numbered. He’s become a ghost in the city, and it’s become ghostly to him. “Once upon a time there used to be a giant state whose name was Soviet Union,” he thinks.

So a band name starting with “X,” a multigendered quartet, a record label beginning with “D,” a whiff of the forbidden: “Close enough,” I thought, and made my purchase.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/arts/music/the-short-lived-cleveland-band-x__x-is-back.html

Born in Southern California, Spot produced albums for some of the most seminal bands of those scenes in the ’70s and ’80s — Black Flag, the Misfits, the Minutemen, the Meat Puppets and Hüsker Du among them. When he wasn’t behind the mixing board at SST Records, the label founded by Black Flag’s Greg Ginn, he was likely to be roller-skating the boardwalks — or behind the lens of his Nikon, photographing the skate ramps, the beaches, the house parties. Bruised and bloodied and tanned from the day’s skating, everyone would head to see whichever band was playing that night, and then Spot would stay up late in the darkroom afterwards. Those sleepless, exciting times are documented in Spot’s first book of photographs, “The Sound of Two Eyes Opening,” out Friday from Sinecure.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/28/sound-of-two-eyes-opening-spot-photography-book/

2014-11-28,Inside the List,"In “There Was a Little Girl,” No. 11 on the hardcover nonfiction list, Brooke Shields writes frankly and tenderly about her mother.","Mother and Daughter: The cover of Brooke Shields’s latest memoir, “There Was a Little Girl” (new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 11), shows the author sometime in the mid-1970s, relaxing happily on the lap of her mother and manager, Teri Shields, their hands touching and their heads tilted girlishly together. It’s a sweet and wholesome image, and a far cry from a photo that ran around the same time on the cover of New York magazine, depicting Brooke in full makeup with a haughty stare while her mother grasped her shoulders. “Meet Teri and Brooke Shields,” the cover read. “Brooke is 12. She poses nude. Teri is her mother. She thinks it’s swell.” Shields doesn’t mention that article in her book, which is subtitled “The Real Story of My Mother and Me,” but she does talk about the media uproar surrounding Louis Malle’s 1978 film “Pretty Baby,” in which she played an underage prostitute, and all of the racy jobs that followed. “There was a sense of fury and a need to assume that I was a victim,” she writes. “There was a firestorm, and Mom took most of the heat.” Although Shields writes frankly and painfully about her mother’s chronic drinking and poor career decisions, the book — which was prompted, she says, by her reaction to The New York Times’s obituary after Teri Shields died in 2012 — is mostly tender. “It is not a ‘Mommie Dearest’ tale. But I’m not holding her up on a pedestal, either,” she writes. “It is simply my turn to tell the story as I saw and felt it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2014-11-30,1889: Metropolitan Opera House Reopens in New York,From the International Herald Tribune archives: The Metropolitan Opera House reopens in New York in 1889.,"Wealth, art and society were well represented at the reopening of the Metropolitan Opera House. It marked the beginning of the sixth season of opera in German. The house had a brilliant appearance when the curtain rose on the first act of Wagner’s “Flying Dutchman.” Although it rained in torrents all the evening, the ladies appeared in their rarest toilettes, and the boxes literally blazed with diamonds. Mrs. Astor was in white pink brocade, and occupied a box with Miss Marion Longdon and Mr. Ward McAlister. Miss Longdon wore pale yellow with a long boa of ostrich feathers. In an adjoining box sat Mrs. William C. Whitney in a décolleté dress of pale green and silver, with diamonds in her hair. Mrs. Paran Stevens wore a brocade toilette, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt wore white brocade and pearls. On the stage interest centred chiefly in Theodore Reichmann, the popular Viennese barytone, and in Fraulein Sophie Weisner, the soprano, who made their debut in this country as Senta and Vanderdecken. Reichmann scored a great and instant success, thanks as much to his admirable and artistic acting as to his rich and sympathetic voice. Fraulein Weisner’s success was less emphatic, although, like Reichmann, she was warmly applauded. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1889",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/1889-metropolitan-opera-house-reopens-in-new-york/

Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps Bertie conquer a debilitating stutter. And Ms. Carter is Elizabeth, his wife and staunch support system, who can’t quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the divorced American who leads Bertie’s older brother, David (Guy Pearce), to abdicate as Edward VIII. “It isn’t exactly ‘Pygmalion,’ not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie’s biggest draws,” Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which received 12 Oscar nominations and won four. “Like many entertainments of this pop-historical type,” she added, “ ‘The King’s Speech’ wears history lightly, no matter how heavy the crown.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

2014-11-30,1914: Russians Dominate in East Poland,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Russians dominate in East Poland in 1914.,"PETROGRAD — The steady increase in the strength of the Russian troops is transforming the appearance of the battles in East Poland. During the recent fighting in this region, and more particularly on Thursday, the Germans have sustained enormous loss. After a multitude of charges by the Russian cavalry, the state of the fields and roads rendered the use of automobiles absolutely impossible. The Russians have consequently garaged a large number of their machines at Lodz, whither they are also sending hundreds of transport and ammunition wagons captured from the enemy. The prolongation of the struggle in the neighborhood of Lodz is probably due to the feverish activity on the German strategic railways on the Silesian frontier. The enemy is bringing up troops with all possible speed, and it is estimated that 50,000 men, or nearly half the garrison of Breslau, were despatched north-west to Czenstochowa to join the newly-formed army in that region. Another great battle is to be expected somewhere between Lodz and Kalisz. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 1, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/1914-russians-dominate-in-east-poland/
