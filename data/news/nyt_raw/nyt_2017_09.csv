The critic Frank Kermode believed that novels developed alongside a loss of faith in biblical chronology, as substitutes for Adam and Eve’s universal family plot. He is borne out by recent years’ fruitful crop of epics rooted in the familiar soil of fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, blood, sex, bastardy and inheritance.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/books/review/counternarratives-john-keene-family-sagas.html

There’s a 16-seat dessert bar, as well as booths and tables, and playing-card motifs on the walls. The six-course dessert tasting, which includes some more savory items, like olive oil gelato with sea salt and eucalyptus to clear the palate, is $68, by reservation for people of drinking age.

In the wake of Munnu’s 2012 death at age 54 from brain cancer, his 33-year-old son, who friends call Sid, has emerged in his own right as a designer — and bon vivant. Munnu brought Indian fine jewelry the international recognition once reserved for European houses and championed previously unsung stones like the spinel; his son, who opened a vivid new Mumbai boutique in 2015, aims to further marry historical influences with contemporary settings in his work. Good-naturedly dodging his mother’s entreaties to settle down, the peripatetic and engaging Kasliwal scours the world for outrageous gems (a recent find was an old 10-carat mine diamond at a Las Vegas antiques show) and the best parties. When not on the road or in India, he can be found in his Upper East Side Manhattan atelier, entertaining clients in the scarlet-upholstered suite of a townhouse, surrounded by velvet-lined trays of glittering adornments. ‘‘I was raised for this,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s the best life you can imagine.’’",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/t-magazine/fashion/sid-kasliwal-gem-palace-profile-in-style.html

2017-09-06,The DACA ‘Fix’ That Immigration Activists Fear,"By upending Obama’s executive order, Trump is likely to reopen fault lines in a beleaguered movement.","When news leaked on Monday that President Trump had decided to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the 2012 policy that granted administrative relief to some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors — some commentators tried to find a ray of hope in the dismal forecast. Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected “Dreamers” from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: ‘Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,’ ” Curbelo told “All Things Considered,” “ ‘as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.’ ” Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief.

Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters.

Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of “True to the Game” are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods’s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story.

2017-09-07,‘The Way to Survive It Was to Make A’s’,They were the first black boys to integrate the South’s elite prep schools. They drove themselves to excel in an unfamiliar environment. But at what cost?,"The road to Virginia Episcopal School was more secluded in those days, winding a few miles from the white section of segregated Lynchburg through a wood of maple and oak to the school’s rolling campus, shielded by trees and the more distant Blue Ridge Mountains. The usual stream of cars navigated the bends on the first day of school, white families ferrying their adolescent sons. Like nearly every other elite prep school in the South, it had been the boarding school’s tradition since its founding in 1916 that its teachers guide white boys toward its ideal of manhood — erudite, religious, resilient. But that afternoon of Sept. 8, 1967, a taxi pulled up the long driveway carrying a black teenager, Marvin Barnard. He had journeyed across the state, 120 miles by bus, from the black side of Richmond, unaccompanied, toting a single suitcase. In all of Virginia, a state whose lawmakers had responded to the 1954 court-ordered desegregation of public schools with a strategy of declared “massive resistance,” no black child had ever enrolled in a private boarding school. When Marvin stepped foot on V.E.S. ground, wearing a lightweight sport jacket, a white dress shirt, a modest necktie and a cap like the ones the Beatles were wearing, the white idyll was over.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/magazine/the-way-to-survive-it-was-to-make-as.html

This was not so long ago, and yet the world back then was still so unmapped: A traveler could and did wander through it like Pausanias, like Ibn Battuta, like the explorers who wrote the first drafts of the romance of movement, of the twinned danger and delight of finding oneself in a place where one was at the mercy of unfriendly but intriguing strangers. A traveler, back then, was far less likely to find in the foreign traces of the familiar. Depending on where he ventured, he had significantly fewer guarantees of safety, and equally thrillingly, only limited ways of communicating with those he knew and had left behind. And it wasn’t only that you could (and, indeed, would) travel as Ibn Battuta had, but, crucially, you could travel where Ibn Battuta had, as well: Sanaa and Baghdad and Damascus, all of which are now treacherous or off-­limits, cities in countries forced by war or disaster or bad governance to deny their cultures’ extravagant senses of hospitality.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/t-magazine/bruce-chatwin.html

Hayden, who developed a love for artist-made books while a graduate student at the Maryland Institute College of Art and most recently worked with Hauser & Wirth’s Book & Printed Matter Lab, found the pocket-size space while searching for an apartment on Craigslist. The idea for a bookshop came together almost immediately. She tapped designers Jonathan Olivares, Paul Matevosyan and Raffy Mardirossian to create simple, bold shelving — painted mustard yellow in a nod to the Ed Ruscha painting from which the shop takes its name — and began sourcing books. Oof specializes in artist-made and locally published books and zines, as well as older catalogs and monographs. Some of Hayden’s favorite recent finds include Jenny Holzer’s “Truisms” and a Fernand Léger that she says, “I’m definitely going to grieve a bit to sell.” The shop also features art objects by ceramist Grant Levy-Lucero and hosts regular work and talks from emerging L.A. artists.  — MERRELL HAMBLETON ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/t-magazine/zaria-forman-eris-parfums-editors-picks.html

It wasn’t from the nonstop news coverage on CNN and elsewhere; it was from the transmissions that lay behind it, in the pulses of information coming down from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, crucial tools for monitoring big storms in the Gulf of Mexico, were capturing cloud formations, surface temperatures and barometric pressures, which were then fed into computer models tracking the storm’s strength and intensity. At the same time, NASA was using a group of satellites to keep tabs on soil moisture, flood patterns and power failures all over East Texas. In various ways, this torrent of data was being collected continuously from hundreds (or even thousands) of miles overhead, through radar instruments and spectroradiometer sensors and exquisitely calibrated imaging cameras. The machines being used aren’t household names — they go by acronyms like GOES-13, Modis and SMAP — but they demonstrate why the popular view of Earth as a big blue planet with only the Moon as its companion could do with some revising. We are also surrounded by a constellation of satellites spinning elliptical webs of environmental observation, day and night.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/magazine/what-could-we-lose-if-a-nasa-mission-goes-dark.html

But it was not technically office space, either — it was the bottom three floors of one of the opulent Beaux-Arts style mansions built by wealthy Bruxellois during the late 1800s, in the quiet, forested area south of the city center. Belgium’s architectural conservation laws had been notoriously lax, and so over the decades many of those buildings were demolished or carved up into offices or apartments. But the interiors of this one had somehow survived mostly intact, with ornate stucco moldings, marble fireplaces, wooden paneling, wrought-iron stair rails and parquet floors made in the traditional way, without a single nail.

2017-09-15,Alice Waters’s Grilled Cheese Is Not Like Yours and Mine,"In her best-selling new memoir, “Coming to My Senses,” the chef recommends a French mountain cheese and homemade sauerkraut for a childhood staple.","LUNCH MENU: The chef and restaurateur Alice Waters’s new memoir, “Coming to My Senses,” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 13, and for all of its frank talk about free love and hard drinking, its most scandalous revelation may be that when Waters was in grade school in suburban New Jersey, she used to trade her peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches for bologna and cheese on white bread. Alice Waters? The owner of Chez Panisse and generalissimo of the organic food revolution? Back then, she happily admits, her favorite lunch was grilled cheese with pickles and maybe an orange soda, if she could sneak out to a local dinette. “I think of grilled cheese sandwiches as one of the great comfort foods,” she writes, before snapping out of it to become the Waters we all recognize: “These days I make them with a Cantal, a mountain cheese from France that’s a little like a Swiss — I like my cheese to be a bit tangy. I usually choose some good whole wheat or levain bread from Acme Bread Company. I slice the cheese and put it inside the bread, put some olive oil in a cast iron pan — not too much! — drizzle oil on the top of the sandwich, and then weight it down with another cast iron pan. When it gets really brown, I turn it over, and when the cheese starts to bubble out the sides, I take it out. Then I rub both sides with half a clove of garlic and serve it with a dill pickle or some sauerkraut (good homemade sauerkraut, not the kraut out of the can that I never liked as a child!). Or I’ll have a little undressed salad on the side — the melted cheese and the olive oil from the sandwich almost dress the lettuce. Sometimes in the summer I’ll put some hot peppers in.” All right, that does sound pretty good. But it’s probably for the best that Chez Panisse never established a children’s menu. I’d hate to see what Waters does to chicken fingers.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/books/review/alice-waters-best-seller-list-memoir-coming-to-my-senses.html

The director, Chris Moukarbel, frames the story with scenes from Gaga’s February Super Bowl halftime performance, her studded boots dangling midair as she is hoisted to the stadium rafters. But it’s her cyclonic private life that fascinates as a multitude of producers, publicists, masseuses, doctors and makeup artists help manage her workday and the pain caused by a hip fracture in 2013.

2017-09-15,T Magazine Editors on Things They’re Into Right Now,A not-exhaustive list of what's on our radar.,"Fashion collaborations can feel like calculated mismatches meant to surprise you with their own improbability. Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos have taken the opposite approach, filling a pop-up shop in a South Kensington, London townhouse with design pieces by people they already love and collect: their friends. It’s an impressive group that includes Martino Gamper, famous for his 3D drawing project “100 Chairs in 100 Days,” whose button-top stools figure in the space, and his wife, the sculptor Francis Upritchard, who helped choose a vibrant orange for the walls. The shade reminded Pilotto and de Vos of houses they’d seen on a recent trip to Lima, Peru (“we’re currently in a South America phase,” Pilotto says). Elsewhere is a hand-knotted rug with a painterly diamond motif from Ecuador, an actual painting by Peter McDonald and a bench that the designer Bethan Laura Wood covered with a rainbow-hued patchwork textile. It’s a perfect complement to the brand’s latest ready-to-wear collection, which Pilotto describes as “tropical-baroque” and includes quilted microfiber jackets and an asymmetrical dress embroidered with chenille yarn. One day, he and de Vos were in the studio of the glassblower Jochen Holz and found themselves drawn to a series of glass coat hooks Holz had made, which Holz has now remade for them as a series of sculptural glass-drop earrings and cuffs. “It was about playing with different materials and seeing what we could do,” says Pilotto. “And just such a natural dialogue between disciplines.” Fittingly, the shop will stay open through fashion week, the London Design Festival and Frieze. 3 Cromwell Pl., London — KATE GUADAGNINO ",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/t-magazine/peter-pilotto-jw-anderson-uniqlo-editors-picks.html

2017-09-20,Women Finding Empowerment in ‘A World of Smoke’,"In an impoverished port city in the Ivory Coast, women formed a cooperative to eke out a living making charcoal from the castoffs of sawmills and workshops.","In the charcoal fields of San Pedro, a bustling port city in the southwest Ivory Coast, hundreds of women and children — some barely school-age — toil day and night among heaps moldering wood, waste water and air thick with smoke. Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro’s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers.

For her spring 2018 collection, shown in London last weekend, Margaret Howell presented a characteristically minimal A-line skirt in a black and white cotton silk check that reminded me of starched schoolgirl uniforms, golden September days in New England and the tea-length hemlines of the late 1930s and 1940s that feel spot-on today.

She spent two days just wandering the grounds, where contemporary sculptures (a monumental steel chair covered in antlers, a tiny wood house in a clearing) by the likes of Marina Abramovic, Robert Wilson and Maya Lin stand amid tall beech trees and, in some cases, grazing cows. (The art foundation shares the land with a working dairy farm.) Deep in the woods, Holzer found herself thinking of ‘‘fairy tales light and dark.’’ Then she came upon a waist-high stone wall that dates to the 1700s. ‘‘I started following it and knew it was the site,’’ she says. Her contribution to what is now known as ‘‘Wanas Wall’’ was to carve a different phrase or truism from her past work into a stone block every 20 feet or so. ‘‘all things are delicately interconnected,’’ reads one.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/t-magazine/design/european-art-parks-sculpture.html

She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100,000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big.

She puts an extraordinary pressure on language by her parsimoniousness. But she restricted not only her language very narrowly — apparently, she restricted her life very narrowly, too.

When you are immature, every bad thing can feel like a crisis, and every good thing like ecstasy; the rest of the world watches us with a sense of weariness and unflappability that is earned only after many centuries of witnessing governments and empires and civilizations and self-styled saviors rise, crescendo and tumble.

In the photographs, taken in 2015, the walls are stained and peeling, the floors spattered with paint. One can clearly see the ravages of time.

The classic pale ivory cheese with fruity, citric flavors is now available.

The cheese, made in very small batches at the Cornell Food Processing and Development Laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y., is aged for 12 months in Murray’s ripening caves in Queens. The resulting Cheddar has a creamy, yet firm and slightly crumbly texture. The cow milk comes from the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company in the Hudson Valley and, vegetarians should note, the wheels are rubbed with lard from New York State pigs before the cheesecloth is applied, something that is frequently done when making Cheddar: Murray’s Clothbound Cheddar, $29.99 a pound, murrayscheese.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/dining/new-york-cheddar-murrays-cheese.html

He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/donald-trump-jrs-great-escape.html
