(Sundance) ORLANDO (1993) A beautiful young nobleman (Tilda Swinton, above) adored by an aging Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp) falls asleep one night in the 17th century and wakes up five days later as a woman. “Same person, no difference at all,” she says, unflustered. “Just a different sex.” She continues to learn about life through the centuries up until the present, pondering the differences between men and women — as well as their similarities — in this adaptation by Sally Potter of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel. Charlotte Valandrey plays Sasha, a wanton Muscovite princess with whom the male Orlando falls in love. Billy Zane is the American with whom Orlando’s female version has a more enduring if less sexually demanding relationship. “This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled without ever being anesthetized,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “ ‘Orlando’ could well become a classic of a very special kind, not mainstream perhaps, but a model for independent filmmakers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory.” More than anything else, he added: “ ‘Orlando’ is Ms. Swinton’s triumph.

There was, and remains, a gauziness to the picture; Reagan retained, throughout his political career, the remoteness of a screen idol, though he never achieved that status as a movie actor. He was ubiquitous for decades and, as president, left a lasting imprint on America’s political culture. Yet he was all the same an unknowable man — even to those nearest him. In White House meetings, he was mostly silent, often leaving his aides to guess at (and feud over) his views. In his personal relationships, he was unfailingly warm but rarely intimate. “He doesn’t let anybody get too close,” one observer said. “There’s a wall around him.” That the observer was his wife, Nancy, should give pause to any politician or pundit who claims to know what Reagan would do if he were here today.

I look at the cracks in all the walls, the evidence of a foundation crumbling beneath us. I smell the char of the fire, the sweet reek of mold, the insult of mouse urine. I see a million things that have to be fixed, restored, corrected, each one impossible and each task mandatory for me to escape again.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/books/review/loving-day-by-mat-johnson.html

That incredible diversity is possible because each species has a distinct diet, a new study concludes. Little is known about the specific plants that elephants, impalas, zebras and other large herbivores eat. With a technique called DNA metabarcoding, researchers at Princeton University analyzed the feces of seven species, matching gene sequences they found to a reference library of plant DNA. All of the species consumed different diets, the scientists found, even those similar in size, digestive physiology and location. The findings, which appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, may help researchers maintain wildlife diversity in the African savannas.",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/herbivores-of-varied-tastes.html

2015-06-02,"‘The Making of Zombie Wars,’ by Aleksandar Hemon",Aleksandar Hemon’s comic novel about alienation and the undead.,"The Summer of Love rolled into town and left behind an S.T.D. otherwise known as 1968. The Vietnam War ratcheted up the body count. Racial strife led to nationwide riots. The murders of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy must have made the end times seem at bloody hand. Cue Nixon and that silent majority. Forty-seven years later we still live in the era’s apocalyptic shadow, those events a zombie horde in ever-present pursuit — race issues, ill-considered wars, the Russians — that infects us with the undead past. Oh, and you can also blame 1968 for that unfortunate metaphor, because in October of that year George A. Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead” introduced us to a new kind of zombie: slow yet relentless, brainless yet hungry, endlessly symbolic yet always supercool. These flesh eaters have fed well on our culture, evolving from B-movie ghouls to bankable, if thankless, stars of film and screen, book and video game, to the point where they should probably unionize. We are living in peak zombie. Now, into this fray tiptoes Aleksandar Hemon with his latest novel, “The Making of Zombie Wars.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/books/review/the-making-of-zombie-wars-by-aleksandar-hemon.html

Hughes, a 29-year-old banker at Moelis & Company, was found dead with drugs in his system after falling from a building in Manhattan. In April, Sarvshreshth Gupta, a 24-year-old first-year analyst at Goldman Sachs, was found dead in San Francisco after telling his father about suffering from intense stress. The official cause of death has not yet been determined in either case, but a recent string of deaths among young Wall Street workers have prompted financial firms to re-evaluate their work policies’ impact on staff members,  Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. It’s difficult to definitively link a death to a firm’s work conditions, and Mr. Sorkin notes that studies have suggested that financial service employees are at higher risk than those in many other industries. “Still, the string of deaths on Wall Street appears to rise above the level of simple coincidence,” he writes.

(IFC) AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998) In an Oscar-nominated role, Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a white supremacist who goes to prison for a gruesome killing. He renounces racism there, but his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), a high school student, remains steadfast in the attitudes he learned from Derek. After Danny writes a book report on “Mein Kampf,” his principal, Dr. Robert Sweeney (Avery Brooks, above left, with Mr. Norton), creates a remedial course for him called American History X. Dr. Sweeney visits Derek in prison and they agree to try to persuade Danny to give up his bigotry. “ ‘American History X’ has enough fiery acting and provocative bombast to make its impact felt,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this film directed by Tony Kaye. “For one thing, its willingness to take on ugly political realities gives it a substantial raison d’être. For another, it has been directed with a mixture of handsome photo-realism and visceral punch.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

An important part of this famously musical choreographer’s talent has been applied to pieces by composers from the late 17th century to the late 18th — notably Purcell, Bach, Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Haydn (1732-1809) isn’t just a central composer of that period; he also often exemplifies the same qualities as Mr. Morris: high spirits, terrific humor, a strong inclination to the pastoral and a keen instinct for structural experimentation. Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morris’s “The Letter V” — choreographed to Haydn’s Symphony No. 88 in G (1787). (Some Haydn symphonies were once known by letters of the alphabet; V was assigned to this one — hence this ballet’s title.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/arts/dance/review-mark-morris-and-hadyn-join-to-brighten-houston-ballet-program.html

The 38-year-old British artist, who is the youngest member of London’s prestigious Royal Academy of Arts, has just unveiled “The Dappled Light of the Sun,” a colossal steel sculpture that scales the institution’s classical courtyard like an alien landing. Even for Shawcross — an artist celebrated for his feats of engineering, spanning rope machines, reconfigured robots and even a pair of rotating wooden arms for Raf Simons’s runway — this is ambitious. Each of the 8,000 pieces has been handmade in five diminishing scales; when laid flat, the piece comprises about 7 ½ miles of welded steel and weighs in at around 30 tons. “It exploits the geometry of the tetrahedron,” Shawcross explains of the mass of pyramid shapes. “Seen on their own, they’re very rational and ordered, but together, they become totally unruly. So the finished work is full of energy and movement.

2015-06-04,A Chandelier That Stands the Tests of Time,The architect and glassblower Alison Berger’s latest lighting fixture is inspired by the anatomy of a pocket watch.,"“I like instruments that try to quantify the ephemeral; a barometer traces air pressure, or an astrolabe charts the stars, and this measures the passing of time,” says the artist Alison Berger, gesturing to a printout from the book “Pocket Watches: From the Pendant Watch to the Tourbillon.” The anatomy of the once-everyday trinket, and her training as an architect and as a glassblower, informed her latest creation, the Clock Chandelier. “One gear moves slowly and the other moves quickly — large and small, fast and slow,” she says, a rhythm articulated in the spacing of the chandelier’s lightbulbs and candles suspended from three interlocking bronze and steel rings. Berger, who has made so-called heirlooms for the upcoming generation (think cereal bowls, in lieu of egg cups) for Hermès and has constructed a new façade for a Comme des Garçons store, considered each detail: The candlelit lanterns can be unhooked for cleaning and the rings fit together using pins, as they would in a timepiece. “The chandelier looks open and endless from one view, but on the other side it is more compressed,” Berger says — a metaphor, she explains, for the feeling of, “Oh my god, it’s already 5 o’clock.” ",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/alison-berger-clock-chandelier/

The dinosaur had a longer nose horn than Triceratops, and two small horns above its eyes. But its most distinctive feature was a radiating frill, a set of large, pentagonal plates like a crown atop its head. Researchers at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Canada named their find Regaliceratops peterhewsi. They first stumbled on the bones sticking out of a cliff along the Oldman River, in southeastern Alberta, about a decade ago. Like other horned dinosaurs, Regaliceratops probably evolved during the late Cretaceous, 65 million to 100 million years ago.

2015-06-04,Review: Mark Morris and Haydn Join to Brighten Houston Ballet Program,The premiere of Mr. Morris’s “The Letter V” was part of a triple bill with the work of two other choreographers.,"HOUSTON — Why hasn’t Mark Morris set more dances to works by Joseph Haydn? An important part of this famously musical choreographer’s talent has been applied to pieces by composers from the late 17th century to the late 18th — notably Purcell, Bach, Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Haydn (1732-1809) isn’t just a central composer of that period; he also often exemplifies the same qualities as Mr. Morris: high spirits, terrific humor, a strong inclination to the pastoral and a keen instinct for structural experimentation. Last week, the Houston Ballet gave the premiere of Mr. Morris’s “The Letter V” — choreographed to Haydn’s Symphony No. 88 in G (1787). (Some Haydn symphonies were once known by letters of the alphabet; V was assigned to this one — hence this ballet’s title.)

Whatever you think of him as a ­composer — self-­imitator or icon of postmodern symphony and opera — Glass is one of the most articulate composers around.

It has all the elements of a particular kind of post-60s American ­coming-of-age story: Farm kid leaves home for the big city (in Riley’s case, rural Montana is abandoned for San Francisco) and dives headlong into adulthood, with all of its requisite heartbreak. Drugs are ingested, Janis Joplin is played on a jukebox, and many drives are taken through the countryside on motorcycles or a beat-up Mustang. But “The Given World” contains what feels like 12 times the usual dose of tragedy within its pages, because Riley and her generation come of age poisoned by the Vietnam War.

First appearing in Harper’s and collected now with his latest short stories, “Coup de Foudre” is a thinly — or possibly barely — veiled account of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, in which Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper at a New York City hotel. The criminal charges, which led to the disclosure of a hidden world of sex parties and erotic compulsion, came to nothing. But Strauss-Kahn eventually paid a hefty fine after a civil action, and his reputation was ruined, perhaps because of the question that was impossible to ignore: “What made him do it?” What would cause the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, wealthy and successful beyond measure, to risk everything in such a fashion?

2015-06-05,Inside the List,"Chuck Palahniuk, whose “Make Something Up” is No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list, is also promoting his first graphic novel, a sequel to his 1996 novel “Fight Club.”","Save the Ducklings: Chuck Palahniuk — who remains best known for the 1996 novel “Fight Club,” despite a string of subsequent hits — has another hardcover best seller with his first story collection, “Make Something Up,” new at No. 8. There’s no mistaking Palahniuk’s sense of plotting. Here’s how Robert Brink of the website The Hundreds sums up the collection: “So this one kid, he’s pledging for a frat and drops acid, the Hello Kitty kind, right before he’s about to be a contestant on ‘The Price Is Right.’ And this other guy, he slaps his prostate-cancer-­ridden, morphine-­pickled father square in the face with a pie as he’s dying in his hospital bed. And then there’s these high school kids who begin to lobotomize themselves with cardiac defibrillators because they discovered the key to true happiness.” Yep, that’s Palahniuk. Even casual fans, though, may be interested to know that “Make Something Up” is not the only new book Palahniuk is promoting — he’s also written his first graphic novel, and it’s a sequel bearing the straightforward title “Fight Club 2.” In an interview with The Wrap, he explained he needed some distance before he felt ready to revisit this story. “If I followed it up too soon,” he said, “my whole career would be writing progressively less interesting sequels to ‘Fight Club.’ ” He chose the comics format, he said, because “if it was written as a novel or a film, it’d be compared to previous versions. . . . Certain things work in comics because there’s a slight aspect of unreality.” Given his reputation for disturbing readers, Palahniuk was asked, what makes him personally squeamish? “I saw a headline about animal abuse recently,” he replied. “ ‘Man Runs Over Ducklings With Lawnmower.’ That kind of stuff.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Her style is understated, elegiac, her perspective oblique.

(SYFY) THE PRESTIGE (2006) Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) work together as assistants in magic performances before a tragedy turns them into lifelong enemies. As performing magicians, they seek vengeance on each other through obsessive one-upmanship. Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine play supporting roles as Angier’s wife and his manager. “ ‘The Prestige,’ directed by Christopher Nolan from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan, is an intricate and elaborate machine designed for the simple purpose of diversion,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Set in a stylized late-Victorian world of dueling music-hall magicians and diabolically clever inventors, it has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure, zipping around in time and scattering clues throughout its busy scenes and frames. Like ‘Memento,’ also directed by Christopher Nolan and based on a story by his brother, ‘The Prestige’ is a triumph of gimmickry, a movie generous enough with its showmanship and sleight of hand to quiet the temptation to grumble about its lack of substance.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Perry’s announcement on Wednesday — the first we’ve heard from him on the national stage since the oops-heard-’round-the-world throttled his previous candidacy in 2011 — was notable for both its muscular foreign policy rhetoric and its emphasis on his sun-scarred beginnings as a cotton farmer in Paint Creek, Tex. Then as now, however, Perry’s strong suit remains his self-professed status as Texas’ Job Creator in Chief. As he put it in his speech, “During my 14 years as governor, Texas companies created almost one-third of all new American jobs.” That distinction sets Perry apart from other current or former G.O.P. governors now favored over him in the polls: Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Chris Christie.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/magazine/rick-perry-and-the-hazards-of-one-party-rule.html

Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said that roughly 600 refugees a day were arriving in the Greek islands, and that half of them were coming ashore in Lesbos, a picturesque tourist destination ill equipped to handle the flow. The Lesbos arrivals have grown steadily by the month, from 737 in January to more than 7,200 in May. Mr. Edwards said the arrivals, crammed into rubber dinghies and wooden boats, were “straining the island’s capacity, services and resources.” They are part of a broader exodus of people from the Middle East and Africa fleeing war and deprivations in their home countries for risky and sometimes deadly Mediterranean trips to Europe, which has created a crisis for the European Union. The refugee agency said there had been 103,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe via the Mediterranean so far in 2015.

Carter said Tuesday at a gay and lesbian pride event at the Pentagon.

The announcement was another step toward the acceptance of gay and lesbian troops, who could have been expelled from the military because of their sexual orientation until the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in 2011. Extending equal opportunity protections to gay and lesbian troops ensures the military treats “sexual-orientation-based discrimination the same way it treats discrimination based on race, religion, color, sex, age and national origin,” Mr. Carter said.

(IFC) INTOLERABLE CRUELTY (2003) George Clooney plays Miles Massey, the crème de la crème of divorce lawyers, in this Joel and Ethan Coen film. Catherine Zeta-Jones, above with Mr. Clooney, is Marylin, a silken beauty and Miles’s latest client, who becomes mired in a vicious divorce after she catches her husband (Edward Herrmann) cheating yet again. Billy Bob Thornton is her millionaire beau and Miles’s rival for her money-hungry affections. “The Coens, bless their hearts, are too smart to apologize for avarice — it’s what gave screwball comedies a kick, and sends this movie straight to your head,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. “Keep in mind that it’s only a minor rush, but a rush nonetheless. It has a Jell-O-shot smoothness that makes you a little dizzy afterward in recollecting how assured and unremittingly smart ‘Intolerable Cruelty’ is.” In “Fantastic Mr. Fox” (2009), at 1:15 p.m., Mr. Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray lend their voices to this animated tale from Wes Anderson, adapted with Noah Baumbach from the Roald Dahl “anti-fable” about a fox who rallies his animal friends against three evil farmers. “It is precisely the movie that a child smitten with Roald Dahl’s fiction and fascinated by the enigmas of the adult world would dream of making: something to amaze and terrify the grown-ups and win the envy and adulation of his peers,” A.

The building, he wrote, “must have the grace and lightness of a resting butterfly.” The same could be said of the armchair he made for the villa in 1954, which hovers on slender legs, its arms swooping like wings. (An all-white version floated in the entrance; one with a plush green cushion perched in the living room.)

(Starz Cinema) HIGHER GROUND (2011) Corinne Walker, a freewheeling teenage mother turned fundamentalist Christian (played by Vera Farmiga, who also directed, as an adult; her sister Taissa Farmiga as a teenager; and McKenzie Turner as a child) comes to question her faith — and her marriage — when faced with a crisis in this adaptation of “This Dark World,” a 2002 memoir by Carolyn S. Briggs. Joshua Leonard and Boyd Holbrook share the role of Corinne’s husband, a rock guitarist who saves their daughter from death after a bus crash, leading the couple onto the path of salvation. Norbert Leo Butz plays the pastor of their cultlike church. And Dagmara Dominczyk is Corinne’s best friend, who speaks in tongues to God and makes her feel loved. “There is something remarkable — you might even say miraculous — about the way ‘Higher Ground’ makes its gentle, thoughtful way across the burned-over terrain of the American culture wars,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Focused with sympathetic intensity on the ordeal of a single soul, it illuminates, as though from within, a complex spiritual struggle.” But, he added, “what faith and doubt have in common is that both are hard work, and the hard-won wisdom of ‘Higher Ground’ is that human nature does not necessarily distinguish between saints and sinners.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this biopic, whose ensemble cast features Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Delroy Lindo, Jacqueline Bisset, Dabney Coleman and Mo’Nique, a “lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills.” What makes it “the ultimate Tony Scott movie — or as a friend put it, ‘It’s all the Tony Scott you could possibly want in a Tony Scott movie!’ — is its uncharacteristically sharp screenplay,” she said of its script by Richard Kelly. “Mr. Scott has worked with talented writers before, but this is the first time he has shot a film written by a screenwriter who both cops to the great enjoyment that can be had from the modern action movie — perhaps best illustrated here by the sight of Ms. Knightley unloading two machine guns at once — and blows the action-movie tropes to smithereens.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

But in the case of Victoria Shorr’s “Backlands,” there’s no such danger: Shorr herself reveals the bare bones of the story in the first few pages. Put simply, “Backlands” is the fictionalized account of a real-life one-eyed bandit called Lampião and his lover, Maria Bonita — famous Brazilian outlaws who took from the rich and gave to the poor. From the early 1920s to his capture in 1938, Lampião and his gang controlled much of the Sertão, a huge and dusty swath of land in the northeast of the country, “almost the size of Spain.” More than once, they were cornered but managed to escape. For a long time, Lampião seemed invincible and his life, as Shorr puts it, “was a tango, full of beauty and danger, mixed.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/books/review/backlands-by-victoria-shorr.html

This portrayal, particularly associated with the sociologists Naomi Cahn and June Carbone, definitely captures one distinctive reality of American life — the fact that stable two-parent homes are more common among secular liberal Bobos in the BosWash corridor and elsewhere than they are in, say, certain regions in the Bible Belt. But it’s also important to recognize the exceptions to this pattern, from “red” social models (in the High Plains and Mormon Utah, in particular) that combine high marriage rates and birthrates and relative family stability to “blue” social models (inner city, Rust Belt, Southwestern) that are as unstable as anything Alabaman and Mississippian.

2015-06-12,Inside the List,"Judy Blume, whose adult novel “In the Unlikely Event” is No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list, had two million books in print in 1976, well before The Times had a children’s best-seller list.","Blume’s Day: In the summer of 1976, the Book Review took note of a “new frankness in children’s literature,” and cited as ­Exhibit A the novels of Judy Blume: “She is a kind of heroine to the kids who read and reread her books, and a kind of Little League Grace Metalious to the mothers.” Metalious, you may remember, was the author of “Peyton Place” — that decidedly Major League novel of suburban smut — and being seen as a junior version didn’t hurt Blume’s popularity any. Starting with “Wifey” in 1978 and continuing right up to “In the Unlikely Event” (new at No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list), all four of her adult novels have been best sellers. That’s more than you can say for her most celebrated children’s books, including “Blubber” and “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” although it’s not their fault: The Times didn’t introduce a children’s best-seller list until 2000. Had one existed in 1976, Blume would surely have been on it. She had some two million books in print that year, according to the Times article, which further observed that “Blume’s appeal lies in her ability to speak directly to her readers’ experience. Her characters are usually suburban kids, and not always nice ones.” Blume recently told NPR’s “Weekend Edition” that when she was an adolescent herself, she preferred grown-up literature. “Starting at 12, really, and onward, I was reading adult books,” she said. “Everything that I was curious about, about the adult world, I learned from reading those books. Or I got from them, you know, some idea of what it was like to be grown-up. Which is what I was very, very curious about.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html
2015-06-12,"Popcast: Tenement, Punk and the DIY Scene","Ben Ratliff, Maria Sherman and Liz Pelly discuss the band’s new album.","“Predatory Headlights” is the new album by Tenement, the punk trio from Appleton, Wis. It’s an accomplishment. It’s a double album, with 25 songs, and it took more than three years to make. It gives you an enlarged sense of what the primary songwriter, Amos Pitsch, is most trained at: tightly written riff songs with an almost classical pop sense, descended from pop-punk while transcending its clichés. But it also includes experimental compositions and arrangements involving strings and field recordings and an out-of-tune piano. “Predatory Headlights” is strong and strange and detailed and cohesive; if people are still listening to records from 2015 in 20 years, this might be one of them. Tenement started in 2006 and has spent a lot of its life on the DIY circuit, gigging in living rooms and basements. For quite a while, if you wanted a Tenement record, you had to buy one at a gig. It appears on bills and has recorded split EPs with far more noisy, simple straight-ahead hardcore bands, but it plays music that sounds as if it could have been almost popular at some point in the recent past. Where does Tenement fit into the current punk-hardcore-DIY scene? ",Arts,https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/popcast-tenement-punk-and-the-diy-scene/

Nelsan Ellis is Bobby Byrd, Brown’s longtime best friend, who sticks around as the wives and girlfriends come and go. “Brown’s music and show business ascendance are the heart and soul of a movie that takes his art very seriously,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “None other than Mick Jagger, who has made no secret of his indebtedness to Brown’s stage moves, is the music producer of this film, which puts music front and center, where it belongs. Brown’s real voice, which never sounds dubbed, is used in remixes of his original recordings.” And while the film “largely skirts the issue of race” along with Brown’s alienation of black audiences because of his support of Richard M. Nixon, “in the end, he stood above it all,” Mr. Holden added. “Having won the game, he dwelt in his own realm, where he ruled once and for always as the Godfather of Soul.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

When the proposal to cut a new street through the gardens was abandoned, M. Martin-Ginouvier proposed to build in the centre of the enclosure a tower, 55 mètres high, of iron and crystal. A modification of this scheme has now been supplied by another architect M. Bourdais, and approved of at a meeting of the principal trade men of the Palais. M. Bourdais proposes to build, near the Galerie d’Orléans, a tower 100 mètres high, not of iron and glass, but of stone. His plans show four platforms, accessible by lifts and a staircase, with, at the summit, a lighthouse powerful enough to light the four central arrondissements. — The New York Herald, European Edition, June 15, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/1890-palais-royal-tower/

They kick things off Wednesday with the sale of a trove of objets belonging to their late friend, the upstate-based interior designer Kenyan Lewis, who died suddenly of diabetes complications last December.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/hasbeens-willbees-kai-khune-auction-house/

2015-06-15,"‘The Prime of Life,’ by Steven Mintz",Steven Mintz’s new book gives a full historical timeline of the defining features of adulthood.,"The notion that adulthood, despite its perks, is little more than a booby prize for surviving the scrapes and trials of youth has more or less become a cultural given in the modern age. From the 1950s narrative of soul-crushed men in gray flannel suits to the existential torment of hippies-turned-yuppies in the 1980s to the ­tyrannical scheduling demands of today’s Lean In movement, grown-up life in America is generally framed as a sort of bland entree following the assortment of colorful appetizers that make up childhood and young adulthood. Moreover, as any armchair social anthropologist will tell you, maturity seems to kick in later and later with each passing generation.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/the-prime-of-life-by-steven-mintz.html
2015-06-15,"‘How to Raise an Adult,’ by Julie Lythcott-Haims",Julie Lythcott-Haims cautions against helicopter parenting that keeps kids from growing up.," When did the central aim of parenting become preparing children for success? This reigning paradigm, which dictates that every act of nurturing be judged on the basis of whether it will usher a child toward a life of accomplishment or failure, embodies the fundamental insecurity of global capitalist culture, with its unbending fixation on prosperity and the future. It’s no surprise that parenting incites such heated debates, considering how paradoxical these principles can be when they’re applied to children. When each nurturing act is administered with the distant future in mind, what becomes of the present? A child who soaks in the ambient anxiety that surrounds each trivial choice or activity is an anxious child, formed in the hand-wringing, future-focused image of her anxious parents.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/how-to-raise-an-adult-by-julie-lythcott-haims.html

That said, she’s also well recognized from the many photographs that have been taken of her, notably by her mentors Richard Kern and Ryan McGinley. And she is probably most infamous for her drawings, particularly her “Period Power” illustration for an American Apparel T-shirt that generated significant media notoriety. (To further complicate things, that illustration was originally based on a neon light sculpture that Collins had previously created.)",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/petra-collins-favorite-things/
2015-06-15,Review: Rachel Podger Plays Bach for Flute With Her Violin,"This Baroque violinist played Bach’s Partita in A minor for solo flute, along with Tartini and Biber works, at the Baryshnikov Arts Center.","As a rule, violinists rarely pilfer foreign repertory. They don’t need to. With so much first-rate music written for the violin, the motivation to adapt and transcribe works written for other instruments is low. So why did Rachel Podger, one of the leading performers on the Baroque violin, open her masterly recital at the Baryshnikov Arts Center on Sunday with Bach’s Partita in A minor for solo flute, transposed into the key of G minor? Because when it comes to Bach, Ms. Podger told the audience, “You can’t get enough.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/arts/music/review-rachel-podger-plays-bach-for-flute-with-her-violin.html
2015-06-15,‘Why Grow Up?’ by Susan Neiman,"In her new book, the philosopher Susan Neiman takes on the predicament of maturity in an “infantile age” that dates back to the 18th century."," A great deal of modern popular culture — including just about everything pertaining to what French savants like to call le nouvel âge d’or de la comédie américaine — runs on the disavowal of maturity. The ideal consumer is a mirror image of a familiar comic archetype: a man-child sitting in his parents’ basement with his video games and his “Star Wars” figurines; a postgraduate girl and her pals treating the world as their playground. Baby boomers pursue perpetual youth into retirement. Gen-Xers hold fast to their skateboards, their Pixies T-shirts and their Beastie Boys CDs. Nobody wants to be an adult anymore, and every so often someone writes an article blaming Hollywood, attachment parenting, global capitalism or the welfare state for this catastrophe. I’ve written one or two of those myself. It’s not a bad racket, and since I’m intimately acquainted, on a professional basis, with the cinematic oeuvre of Adam Sandler, I qualify as something of an expert.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/why-grow-up-by-susan-neiman.html

In this case, notes of green galbanum, smoky gaiac wood, dry violet and clean charcoal come together, Raza says, like “a sketch of a forest reflected in a pond.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/t-magazine/regime-des-fleurs-mirror.html

2015-06-17,Taxicab Confessions,What to do with a wedding ring from a brawl?,"Last night I witnessed an assault on a taxi driver. After the passenger jumped out of the cab and kicked it repeatedly, the driver got out and confronted the man. The man suddenly began throwing punches, and a legitimate brawl ensued during which the man yelled things like “go back where you came from” and “I was born in this country, you weren’t.” A small crowd gathered to break up the fight. When the police arrived, I stuck around to defend the cabdriver. The police listened but told me they did not need me as an official witness. I wished the cabdriver luck and went across the street to watch the aftermath play out. The passenger, a black man, was claiming that the cabdriver would not take him to Harlem but that he probably would have if he were white. The police did not arrest the man, nor did they appear to do much of anything in the way of even taking information. During the brawl I heard a ring bounce toward me across the street. I picked it up, and after the cabdriver called the police, I asked him if the ring was his. He said it belonged to the other man. I asked somewhat conspiratorially if he wanted the ring anyway, but he said no. When I got home, I found it was a Cartier wedding band that sold new from $1,100 to $1,600. Today I found a posting on Craigslist, seemingly from the passenger, seeking his ring, lost during an assault, in exchange for a reward. So what do I do?

He guzzled from a can as well-wishers popped into his dressing room, getting in their hellos and handshakes before Noah’s second set of the evening. Noah is a 31-year-old comedian from South Africa, and in September, he is scheduled to take over for Jon Stewart as host of “The Daily Show.” For this reason, Noah gave an especially warm welcome to one backstage visitor: Kent Alterman, the president of content and original programming at Comedy Central, the network Noah had just joined. Alterman had flown from Los Angeles, where he lives and works, to San Francisco, where Cobb’s is located, to watch Noah perform. He helped lead the search for Stewart’s replacement, but tonight would be his first time seeing Noah work a crowd in person. “I’ve known Trevor a few years now, and he’s someone we’ve had our eyes on,” Alterman said. “But I’ve never actually seen him do stand-up before.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/magazine/comedy-central-in-the-post-tv-era.html

2015-06-18,"Classical Playlist: Sibelius, Dvorak and Zorn",Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.,"SIBELIUS: Complete Works for Mixed ChoirHeikki Seppanen, conductor; Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir(Ondine)If you mostly know Sibelius from his visionary symphonies, you might be surprised by the works on this two-disc set. The Finnish choral tradition was rich and active when Sibelius came of age as a composer in the late 1880s, and he wrote choral works all his life, from his student days in Helsinki until 1954 when, at 89 and three decades after his final symphony, he did an arrangement of a favorite Christmas song. The pieces on this rewarding recording range from folk songs suffused with Finnish character to enigmatic works with sometimes dark lyrics. There are festival and school songs, patriotic anthems, a cantata for an academic degree ceremony and, inevitably, two versions of “Finlandia.” Most of the pieces are a cappella. Many unfold in clear, block-chord settings of the texts. If you want to stump friends with a guessing game, play the beguiling, slightly strange “Glade of Tuoni” from this recording and ask them to identify the composer. You’ll win, as you will by picking up this album. (Anthony Tommasini)DVORAK: Symphony No. 9; VARÈSE: ‘Amériques’ Ludovic Morlot, conductor; Seattle Symphony(Seattle Symphony Media)It seems at first a bit perverse, pairing Dvorak’s warm and friendly “New World” Symphony with Varèse’s bellicose and blistering vision of new worlds. More fascinating in any case than the theme of the composers’ physical and psychic encounters with new worlds, whether fleeting or permanent, is the distance musical possibilities themselves had traveled in the mere three decades between the Dvorak (1893) and the Varèse (1922), the great watershed having been Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913), which Varèse mines for all it is worth. The live performances here do equal justice to the coziness and the riotous upheavals. (James R. Oestreich)JOHN ZORN: ‘Hen to Pan’Jay Campbell, cello; Stephen Gosling, piano; Michael Nicolas, cello; Chris Otto, violin; Tyshawn Sorey, drums(Tzadik)The one constant in this feverishly changeable recording of recent chamber works is Mr. Campbell, an amazing musician who’s game for both Mr. Zorn’s technical challenges and his permeating intensity. Much of this album is taken up by three iterations of “Ouroboros” (2014), a seething, frenetic duet for two cellos that can also be performed with an improvising drummer (here the skittering Tyshawn Sorey). The poise of the gorgeous piano trio “The Aristos” (2014) and the delicacy of “Occam’s Razor” (2013), for cello and piano, are mixed in with uncertainty and collapse. The extremes to which Mr. Zorn flings his performers and listeners are not in themselves new, or newly juxtaposed, but he writes with such sensitivity, assurance and joy that it always somehow seems fresh.

Mr. Mazursky’s dramatically shaded comedy is somewhat of a feature-long tease, despite its famous image of the four lined up in bed. (Bob and company aren’t the swingers that they try to be.)

The study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, rated 102 vehicles on how easily a child safety seat could be installed. It focused on the vehicles’ so-called Latch system, which consists of three anchors that the seat is secured to. Only three models received the highest rating of Good: the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Volkswagen Passat. Children are safer when in an age-appropriate child restraint, but these are not always easy to install, especially when using a vehicle’s seatbelts. And if the restraint is not properly anchored to the vehicle, a child could be severely injured in a crash. The federally mandated Latch system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, was meant to be easier than using seatbelts to attach safety seats.

Scott wrote in The New York Times. “A few plot twists test the limits of credibility. And there is something a little dispiriting — if sadly unsurprising — about the way Mr. Chazelle turns a historically African-American art form into the existential arena for a couple of white guys.” Still, he added, “the battle of master and disciple is exciting and terrifying to witness, and, at its best, the film can feel as wild and spontaneous, as risky and precise, as a live jam session.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2015-06-19,How to Train a Cadaver Dog,Find an incurious animal. Use your own blood.,"“Drug dogs are trained on drugs, and cadaver dogs are trained on cadaver,” says Mary E. Cablk, a scientist at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada who studies scent detection. Training a cadaver dog requires regular contact with human blood, decaying flesh and bones. In the United States, dog handlers can legally obtain bodily components like human placenta and blood, but not always easily, and trainers like Cablk often resort to using their own blood. Some substitute commercially available ersatz odors (the most common is Sigma Pseudo Corpse Scent, which comes in three kinds: recently dead, decomposed and drowned). But deceased humans produce unique volatile organic compounds, and canines have a keenly attuned sense of smell, so you should practice on the real thing. “You don’t want to put other people at risk,” Cablk says — searches are often in dangerous areas, like collapsed buildings — “to find what is ultimately a dead pet.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/magazine/how-to-train-a-cadaver-dog.html

At my feet the land falls away into a virgin forest of graceful, pale-barked trees that runs as far as the eye can see. Farther up the slope are leggy shrubs with flowers resembling bright plastic hair curlers: banksias, I think. When a small bird appears in the foliage below I fix it in my binoculars. White, black and acid yellow, it has eyes like tiny silver coins, and it is wiping its downcurved beak on a branch of a shrub with strappy leaves. I don’t know what the shrub is, and I’m not sure what the bird is, either. I think it’s a honeyeater, but I don’t know what anything is, not precisely.

The young woman, who is being vetted for the part of stand-in to the famous actress in a film being shot in Casablanca, feigns amiable curiosity. She is desperate to appear sufficiently sane and normal to get the job; she doesn’t want the bodyguard to realize that she herself is living proof of “punctuated equilibrium,” that the sequence of events that have occurred in the 48 hours since her arrival in Casablanca have propelled this previously unremarkable woman into committing a series of frauds that could get her into an awful lot of trouble.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/books/review/the-divers-clothes-lie-empty-by-vendela-vida.html

I don’t read self-help books, except the ones that guarantee I’ll lose 40 pounds in one hour. And I enjoy being co­dependent. My best life is never going to resemble, say, Angelina Jolie’s; I don’t have the cheekbones, can’t fly my own plane, and refugees make me too sad. But perhaps I could step up the consciousness a notch.” This is Wentworth’s second book, after the 2012 best seller “Ali in Wonderland,” a comic memoir about her political childhood (her mother was Nancy Reagan’s social secretary), her Hollywood career and her life as Mrs. George Stephanopoulos. That book’s fans included Jackie Collins — who called it, in these pages, the funniest thing she had ever read — and Charlie Rose, who on his show asked Wentworth where her sense of humor came from. “I was born funny,” she told him. “I think it’s instinctual. I don’t think you can be taught. . . . And I love being unscripted. I mean, this kind of thing to me is one of my favorite things to do.

While the 1992 Los Angeles riots lacked the exhaustive citizen reportage of more recent incidents, there was enough videotape running back then to give the rest of the country the lasting impression of a restless city entirely engulfed in chaos. In his latest novel, “All Involved,” Ryan Gattis imagines a narrative that, while mostly tangential to that chaos, attempts to give it more meaningful context through personalization.

2015-06-21,What’s On TV Sunday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) TRUE DETECTIVE Three law enforcement officers (Colin Farrell, above; Rachel McAdams; and Taylor Kitsch) in a fictional Los Angeles suburb and a career criminal (Vince Vaughn) trying to go legit collide when a city manager is murdered — and a lucrative land scheme disrupted — in Season 2 of this anthology series, created and written by Nic Pizzolatto. “This time, Mr. Pizzolatto doubles down on much of what made the first season so distinctive,” Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “That doesn’t make it twice as good, though. Not nearly.” In the premiere of “Ballers,” at 10, Dwayne Johnson plays a former football pro trying to build a career out of giving financial advice to current players in Miami. The characters’ shenanigans make for “unrewarding, predictable drama, though the writers occasionally try for better,” Neil Genzlinger wrote. And in “The Brink,” a dark comedy at 10:30, the fate of the world rests in the hands of the secretary of state (Tim Robbins), a lowly foreign service officer (Jack Black) and a Navy fighter pilot (Pablo Schreiber) after a rogue general (Iqbal Theba) seizes control of Pakistan and its nuclear arsenal. The writers don’t go very near Islamic extremism or terrorism, Ms. Stanley wrote. “Instead,” she said, “the creators of ‘Brink’ take aim at American wrongdoing. So nobody is going to get in trouble because of this show. But people aren’t going to die laughing, either.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

Its owner and founder, the baker Rick Easton, acknowledges that the loaves’ “ugly, formless and dark” appearance belies their addictive flavor — which he accredits to the 100% stone-milled, high-extraction wheat flour crop he develops with a farmer in Weatherbury Farms in Avella, Pa. At the beginning of the season, Easton experiments with different wheat crops and handling techniques to find the right texture for bread he will serve that year. The result is a pane that feels like whole wheat, but the germ is retained so that the richness and natural oils produce “an incredible amount of flavor and sweetness. From a customer’s perspective, it’s great to be able to think about wheat in that way,” Easton explains. “People are used to this supermarket bread that has a two-hour process. My process is 24 hours, and then we’re talking about crop planning that went in a year ago. So last year, someone was thinking about the grain that you would eat today.” Below, Easton shares a recipe for enjoying his signature loaf — or your own favorite, local bread.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/t-magazine/bread-and-salt-bakery-recipe.html

In just a few decades, planners would build not just aqueducts but the so-called sanitary greens that today we call parks, including Highbridge Park, on the Manhattan side of the bridge. A side benefit of High Bridge was the walkway above the aqueduct that allowed Bronx pedestrians to reach Manhattan. By the 1960s, though, the aqueduct was no longer in use, and city planners, working to fight what was then called urban blight, decided to disconnect the boroughs.

Somewhere down there, in the terraced subclauses of some forgettable subsection, is a word with a special meaning, a word that offers shelter and concealment to whatever it is that the law actually does. Consider the word “relevant.” You and I use the word to distinguish what matters (the relevant) from what does not (the irrelevant). But to the National Security Agency, there was no irrelevant. Pointing to one appearance of the word in a 2006 update of the USA Patriot Act, the agency argued it could demand records of any one of our phone calls, on the very slight chance of some distant connection to terrorism. A secret court agreed, ordering phone companies to serve up our records on an “ongoing daily basis’’ — 24 hours a day, hundreds of billions of calls in all. No one knew about it until Edward Snowden revealed the existence of the program in 2013. Earlier this month, President Obama signed the USA Freedom Act, which is supposed to close this loophole.

2015-06-24,Tell It About Your Mother,Can brain-scanning help save Freudian psychoanalysis?,"In 1900, Sigmund Freud, a Viennese specialist in nervous disorders, began treating the 18-year-old daughter of a rich acquaintance. Freud, who was 44, was just beginning to practice psychoanalysis, a form of therapy that would become known as ‘the talking cure.’ The girl, whom Freud would later refer to as ‘‘Dora,’’ had a cluster of inexplicable symptoms: Her mood was low, she was prone to losing consciousness and, for weeks at a time, she could not speak above a whisper. Freud diagnosed hysteria, a term commonly used in fin de siècle Europe to refer to a disorder in which psychological stress was expressed through physical symptoms. Freud traced Dora’s condition in part to her father’s sexual infidelities that she had felt obliged, from early adolescence, to help orchestrate. When Dora told Freud, in the course of the analysis, that her father’s friend — Herr K., a married man decades her senior — had accosted her in his empty office building, trying to kiss her on her lips, Freud, trained in biology and swept up in his own scientific detachment, couldn’t empathize with her distress. One day, after only 11 weeks of treatment and still far from cured, she stood up at the end of a session, wished Freud a happy new year and never returned.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/tell-it-about-your-mother.html

In that sense, the Malian photographer Seydou Keïta was — like his father, who worked as a blacksmith, carpenter, mechanic and electrician, among other jobs — a craftsman. He was paid by the public to make pictures. But like his esteemed Malian compatriot Malick Sidibé, Mama Casset of Senegal and Joseph Moise Agbodjelou of Benin, he produced such fine work that we now consider him a great African artist. These master photographers gave us panoramas of life in Bamako, Dakar and Porto-Novo, a vivid record of individual people, largely shorn of their names and stories but irrepressibly alive. Here are good clothes gracefully cut, glowing skin, beautifully coifed hair, polished shoes: all the familiar markers of a person taking pride in his or her appearance.

Although there is no way to positively refute statements she has made, neither I nor my two brothers and my mother believe my father capable of the events my sister describes. My father was a kind and giving person. He has living brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews who loved him dearly and would be very upset by my sister’s claims. My husband suggests I confront my sister, but that will most likely not yield a fruitful outcome or change anything. My concern is to protect positive memories. I propose to write about him myself, posting my memories on the Internet. I would not attempt to refute my sister, merely focus on my father and memories of him. This seems the least aggressive path and least likely to create any stir around my sister or her supporters. Since the Internet seems destined to live forever, at least an alternative memorial for my father would exist. Your thoughts are appreciated.

In fact, the plexi-and-LED-lit version of the playground staple neither belongs to nor was crafted by Carlstrom, even if his daughter is, as he says, “very protective of it.” Rather, it’s an extension of the retail collaboration “Austere c/o the Maidstone,” currently overtaking the historic Hamptons inn. Last year, Carlstrom, who is by trade a marketing executive, launched Austere, a multichannel retail venture focusing mostly on Scandinavian heritage brands, which has been dubbed “a magazine you can walk into.” Austere exists as both a 5,000-square-foot store in Los Angeles and an active online portal, which on top of shilling wares satisfies customers’ curiosity with an editorial component that tells the tales of these Nordic brands and the region’s cultural values. “We noticed there are people who make things, people who sell things and people who talk about cool things,” explains Carlstrom, “No one was doing all of it.

Organized by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in collaboration with the Met, the exhibition of more than 90 paintings, watercolors and drawings places Sargent in the trans-Atlantic vanguard of art and culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Subjects include other artists like Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin and writers like Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James. The collector Isabella Stewart Gardner appears in a portrait that rarely leaves the Gardner Museum in Boston. The Shakespearean actress Ellen Terry is pictured performing and in a formal portrait.

This leaderless revolution would come to be known as the Great Migration, and it would reshape every Northern and Western city it touched.

The shock is how deep Mr. Zemeckis and Mr. Washington journey into the abyss and how long they stay there. It can be tough for stars to play such unrepentantly compromised characters, as Mr. Washington does brilliantly here.” And while “you can’t take your eyes off Mr. Washington,” who so normally excels at square-jaw decency, “this time you watch him with agony rather than just admiration.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday.html

Somehow they were confident that merely by rejecting the sentimentality of prewar German Expressionism, and substituting a more realistic, sober view of the life around them, they could not only bring about a new society, but usher in a “new man.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/books/review/new-objectivity-and-max-beckmann-the-still-lifes.html

When the guard at the front desk complied, they bound him and his partner in handcuffs. “This is a robbery,” the intruders announced. “Don’t give us any problems, and you won’t get hurt.” The senior guard was quick to respond. “Don’t worry,” he said. “They don’t pay me enough to get hurt.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/books/review/master-thieves-and-the-art-of-the-con.html

Jewish artists, however, have largely escaped this scrutiny. Perhaps this is strictly owing to a scarcity of significant figures until the rise of abstraction in the second half of the century, which occurred, first and foremost, because of Judaism’s notorious aniconism and its vexed relationship with art.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/books/review/mark-rothko-toward-the-light-in-the-chapel-by-annie-cohen-solal.html

2015-06-25,‘Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi’,A biography of the great border-crossing sculptor.,"The art of biography is not unlike the creation of sculpture. Out of a raw material of artifact and anecdote must emerge the semblance of living form. There may be no one right way to animate such matter. Certainly, there are plenty of wrongs: from hazy abstraction to overwrought realism, from misapplied attention to mannered application. Whatever the approach, however, the spirit of the subject must somehow guide the telling. For Isamu Noguchi, the great border-crossing sculptor of the last century, the art came, he said, from tapping into “the materiality of stone, its essence, to reveal its identity — not what might be imposed but something closer to its being.” The genius of “Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi” is how its author, Hayden Herrera, inhabits the sculpturing hand of its subject. Rather than focus on the surface, Herrera gets “beneath the skin,” as Noguchi would say, to the “brilliance of matter.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/books/review/listening-to-stone-the-art-and-life-of-isamu-noguchi.html

Ansari wrote “Modern Romance” with the N.Y.U. sociologist Eric Klinenberg, framing it as a comprehensive study of dating in the digital age. “Sociology, in a strange way, is similar to comedy,” he said on NPR recently. “It’s a lot about observation and making observations that resonate with people and trying to learn about why people do the things they do. And one idea that really applied to modern romance, in my opinion, was this whole notion of the paradox of choice. . . . Right now we have the most romantic options that any generation has ever had. And you would think, oh, more options, that’s better. But whenever you look at any studies they’ve done, they always find the more options people have, the harder it is for them to make a choice, and that when they do make a choice they’re less satisfied because they’re scared that they maybe chose the wrong thing.

While it was necessary (she argued) to question “the unstated domination of white male subjectivity” that shaped the art historical canon, she found equally suspect the feminist impulse to resurrect forgotten or underappreciated women artists and elevate devalued “feminine” qualities. To get to the heart of the problem, it was necessary to question the notion of “greatness” or “genius” itself. Nochlin was then 40 years old. Two years before, she had experienced a feminist awakening when an acquaintance gave her a briefcase of radical feminist zines. A twice-married mother of two, teaching art history at Vassar College and leading what she had considered until then a fashionable and liberated life, she read until 2 a.m., light bulbs going off in her head. “I kept opening doors,” she would write later, “onto an endless series of bright rooms, each one opening off from the next, each promising a new revelation.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/books/review/women-artists-the-linda-nochlin-reader.html

Called the Pictures Generation, they were born around 1950 and emerged in the late 1970s and early ’80s, standing on the shoulders of the Conceptualists, and for them, photography was very much a “problem.” It sold products, objectified women, glorified men, mythologized nations and rarely told the truth.

2015-06-27,What’s On TV Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) JOHN WICK (2014) A fabled hit man (Keanu Reeves) unleashes mayhem on a Russian mobster (Alfie Allen) who has killed the puppy that was the last gift from his recently deceased wife (Bridget Moynahan) in this savage adventure directed by Chad Stahelski (Mr. Reeves’s stunt double in “Constantine” and two “Matrix” films). Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane and Michael Nyqvist provide backup. “Brilliant in its simplicity, the setup of ‘John Wick,’ like the rest of the movie, passes swiftly and efficiently,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The New York Times, making the film a critics’ pick. “Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style — and even some wit — that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic. Until then, we’re content to tag along as John, revealed as the ne plus ultra of former assassins, comes out of retirement and into the cross hairs.” His quest, she added, “may be one-note, but that note could not be more perfectly pitched.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Even its sole non-British work, the “Beau Gosse” solo from Bronislava Nijinska’s 1924 ballet “Le Train Bleu,” has a strongly British connection: It was created for the Anglo-Irish dancer Anton Dolin (born Patrick Kay), who in the 1980s reconstructed it and another Nijinska solo for the Royal British soloist Stephen Beagley.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/arts/dance/royal-ballets-focus-on-british-choreography-exposes-its-limits.html

Now, rather than the click-clack of heels along the boulevards, he hears hummingbirds as he works alongside his familial team, including his business partner, Jutta Kraus, who lives with him, and other designers and assistants who came along from Paris. “I think this choice turned out to be very spontaneous and a bit naïve, too, but it’s always been that way in my life,” says Wilhelm, who had visited California only once before making the move. “Germans make rational decisions and sometimes I decide to do emotional ones.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/t-magazine/a-paris-designer-sets-up-a-creative-commune-in-the-hollywood-hills.html

(Lifetime) WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING (1995) Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a lonely Chicago train station clerk, leaps to the rescue when Peter (Peter Gallagher), the object of her unspoken desire, is pushed onto the train tracks and falls into a coma. But after a nurse mistakenly identifies her as Peter’s fiancée, she suddenly finds herself surrounded by the family she never had — including his charmingly suspicious brother, Jack (Bill Pullman). When a romantic comedy is “as breezy and adorable” as this one from Jon Turteltaub, “it’s time to fall in love,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “This is a formula film, but it has the kind of good cheer and fine tuning that occasionally give slickness a good name.” Ms. Bullock, above with Micole Mercurio, left, Monica Keena and Jack Warden, brings “a warm smile and a winning array of mannerisms to her role,” she added. And “as Jack does a perpetual slow burn in Lucy’s presence, Mr. Pullman smolders with consummate ease,” engaging in “the graceful teamwork that really makes this story click.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday.html

The killers were sentenced to lengthy jail terms, but — this being Greece, a country notorious for its bloated work force and a safety net that even protects the jobs of convicted criminals — they continued drawing a portion of their salaries while sitting in prison. “They Murdered the Mayor but Still Get Paid!” ran the headline in one Greek newspaper.

At Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, a Tea Party couple visiting from rural Virginia was surprised to find a patch of common ground with Occupiers — at least until the discussion turned to actual policies.

Traveling from Nottingham Contemporary — “which has really built a strong reputation in the last four or five years,” explains Thomas Dane, Ligon’s longtime English gallerist — the intimate retrospective docks in Liverpool today at the Tate’s waterfront warehouse complex. It goes up alongside “Blind Spot,” an exhibition of a series of black pourings by Jackson Pollock — “the man of the hour,” Ligon jokes, moments before his own opening.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/glenn-ligon-encounters-collisions-show/
