But how many feature a boy becoming a man in an instant? The boy here is Billy (Asher Angel), a teenage orphan who is given magic powers that allow him to transform into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) by saying the word “shazam.” His character is based on a lesser-known DC superhero created in 1939 — but the movie’s blasé humor is very contemporary. It’s “a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes,” she added. “But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens, it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-shazam-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood.html

One such resource that has resurfaced is this documentary, which is streaming for free through June 12. In the 1960s, Swedish journalists came to the United States to explore the nascent black power movement. They interviewed political activists including Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale, as well as residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland. About 30 years later, their footage was discovered by a Swedish television network, and the director Goran Hugo Olsson pieced clips together to create this film. He also added voice-over commentary by contemporary figures, like Erykah Badu and Questlove, who explain the movement’s relevance decades later. The movie is by no means a comprehensive overview of the era, but a telling take from an outsider’s perspective.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday-the-black-power-mixtape-and-the-last-og.html

In ancient Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied (and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers and samurai took it up in the 16th century.

A hit man, a jazz trumpeter and a vampire are among the characters in this latest movie from the Canadian filmmaker Bruce McDonald (“Pontypool”). Part absurdist comedy, part noirish horror fable, “Dreamland” assigns its hit man, Johnny Dead Eyes (Stephen McHattie), a gruesome task: cut off the right pinkie finger of a drug-addled trumpeter (also played by McHattie) before he’s due to play a high-profile concert hosted by a criminal known as the Countess (Juliette Lewis), whose shady dealings include involvement in sex trafficking. Chaos ensues, naturally. Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic’s Pick, calling it “strange, challenging and boundlessly confident” in her review in The New York Times. “Gathering the living, the dead and the undead together on a single, surreal plane,” she wrote, “the movie turns its sordid, sex-trafficking plot into a decadent, redemptive fairy tale.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-dreamland-oprah.html

This has become the de facto slogan to describe the series of early-summer 1969 demonstrations that took place in front of New York City’s Stonewall Inn, the gay bar that became a battleground for the movement that catalyzed L.G.B.T.Q. rights in this country. Indeed, this historic rebellion is the reason we celebrate Pride Month each June. But as America rages on — against an uncured pandemic as well as its aftereffects, and for justice following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others at the hands of police — that phrase, “Stonewall was a riot,” has taken on new resonance: It’s an assertion that fighting, not partying, is the root of our story. And this year, as many join in protests chanting “Black lives matter,” we are reminded that the Stonewall liberation was led by trans women of color, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two activists whom city officials decided last year to honor with a monument, after decades of progress being too often attributed to mostly white gay men.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/t-magazine/pride-month-reading-list.html

THE STORY OF ROY COHN 9 p.m. on HBO. Directed by Ivy Meeropol, this documentary airs a day before the anniversary of the execution of her grandparents, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, at Sing Sing prison for espionage in 1953. A prosecutor in their case was a young Roy Cohn, whose involvement quickly led Senator Joseph McCarthy — a staunch anti-communist Republican — to appoint Cohn to his chief counsel. There, Cohn played a major role in expelling government officials thought to be communists or gay, and shortly thereafter he became a personal lawyer to then-businessman Donald J. Trump. Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986. With newly discovered material from Cohn’s career as a power broker, this film aims to expose the life and death of this menacing public figure.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-the-story-of-roy-cohn-taste-the-nation.html

But no matter how advanced your instruction, fine-tuning your brows at home requires a bit of firsthand experience — and restraint (the temptation to over-pluck is the greatest challenge, Garcia cautions).

The conspiracy that Colin (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is seeking to uncover, which Frédérique (Juliet Berto) discovers by accident, is similarly ambiguous. It appears to exist — Frédérique seems to find correspondence between its members, and several avowed participants appear in the film — but its power and status are unclear. This tension is never resolved, but over the course of the film’s more than 12 hours, it deepens and becomes more complex.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-out-1-penn-and-teller-fool-us.html
