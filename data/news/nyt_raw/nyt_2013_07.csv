2013-07-01,What’s on Monday,Television highlights.,"1:50 A.M. (STARZ) A DANGEROUS METHOD (2011) A disturbed young Russian, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), is brought to a clinic in Zurich in the early 20th century, and a doctor named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, above with Ms. Knightley) performs a new treatment called psychoanalysis to help her. Soon she becomes his lover and finally a colleague. But as emotionally connected as Sabina is to Jung, it is with his mentor, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), that she finds a more cerebral affinity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from David Cronenberg, based on a play by its screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, and drawn from a book by John Kerr, a “subtle and intellectually thrilling true story.” The movie “is full of ideas about sexuality — some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation — but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas,” he said. “There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet, but the most unsettling aspect of ‘A Dangerous Method’ may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking. The mind is both slave and master of the body’s appetites, and the absurd and terrifying task of stabilizing that dynamic, in theory and in practice, is embraced equally by the film and the fragile, serious historical figures who inhabit it.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/arts/television/whats-on-monday.html

2013-07-02,What’s On Tuesday,Television highlights.,"11 A.M. (Sundance) RAN (1985) In his masterwork inspired by Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa tells the story of Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), an exhausted 70-year-old warlord who wants to turn the vast dominion acquired through 50 years of bloodshed over to his three sons, on whose kindness he will then depend. The two older sons agree to their father’s terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. But when the youngest argues that by dividing the lands, Hidetora is creating conditions that will lead to disaster, his father sends him into exile. At the same time, the wife (Mieko Harada, above) of his oldest son — the daughter of a lord conquered by Hidetora — encourages her husband to humiliate his father so he can assume control of the family in his own name. “Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ‘Ran’ has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html

The corpses were later identified as those of four prostitutes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes and Amber Lynn Overstreet Costello. The work was believed to be that of a serial killer, and for several months to come, the media circus that accompanied the official investigation — centering on the search for another prostitute, Shannan Gilbert, who had disappeared after a nearby assignation the previous May — kept much of the New York area and the nation entranced. It was a gothic whodunit for the Internet age, replete with prostitutes, drugs, family dysfunction, investigative incompetence, not to mention a strange, insular beach community and, of course, the Web sites of Craigslist and Backpage, where the women had advertised for customers. Robert Kolker, who wrote about the murders for New York magazine in 2011, has produced in “Lost Girls” a compelling, nearly unputdownable narrative of the case and its attendant issues; a horrific, cautionary tale that makes for a very different type of beach read.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/books/review/lost-girls-by-robert-kolker.html

2013-07-04,What’s On Friday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANÇOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, kicks off with four films starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Truffaut’s on-screen alter ego. This first installment begins with “The 400 Blows” (1959), above, Truffaut’s feature film debut, in which he drew inspiration from his childhood for a story about Antoine Doinel, a 12-year-old who escapes his dysfunctional family by turning to crime. “Words cannot state simply how fine is Jean-Pierre Léaud in the role of the boy,” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. “Out of this brand-new youngster, M. Truffaut has elicited a performance that will live as a delightful, provoking and heartbreaking monument to a boy.” The homage continues at 9:45 with “Antoine and Colette,” Truffaut’s episode from “Love at Twenty” (1962) — an omnibus project featuring five segments directed by five filmmakers from five countries — and a short sequel to “The 400 Blows,” set three years later, in which Antoine has his first sentimental adventure. In “Stolen Kisses” (1968), at 10:30, Antoine, fresh out of the army, looks for work and ponders an affair with an older woman. In “Bed and Board” (1970), at 12:15 a.m., Antoine faces up to the responsibilities of adulthood. And in “Love on the Run” (1979), at 2, Antoine, now divorced, continues his search for romantic fulfillment. The night ends at 4 with “The Green Room” (1978), based in part on “The Altar of the Dead” and two other stories by Henry James, in which Truffaut stars as a writer and World War I veteran who spends his life grieving the loss of his young wife.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

In his diary he describes her as having an “empty face that wore its emptiness openly.” From 1912 to 1917 he wrote hundreds of letters to her. When he stopped corresponding, he dreamed of her as “someone who was dead and could never live again.” He burned her letters when their long engagement was finally broken off; she saved his.

In this first of four episodes, Morse and Thursday investigate burgled gas meters, a dead secretarial student, a string of post office robberies and a love child. “The lead actors do good work, even though their job, to some extent, is to make themselves part of the period décor,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “In the course of Sunday’s episode Morse develops one of his patented hopeless crushes on a suspect, and it gets him busted down from bagman to general duty.

The project, a poem written by Geoffrey O. Todd with illustrations by Rich Berner called “Back to the Wild,” was to chronicle a new adventure in which Max travels with his daughter, Sophie, to see the Wild Things for the first time in 30 years. In the original Kickstarter post, published in May, the authors said they hoped to raise £25,000 (about $37,270) to publish the work and had “been very careful not to impinge on Mr. Sendak’s copyright and have taken the necessary legal advice around this whole project.” HarperCollins Publishers, which published the original book, felt differently. In a legal notice sent to Kickstarter on July 3, the company said, “Any such unauthorized ‘sequel’ would clearly violate the estate’s right to create derivative works.” Before Sendak died last year, at 83, he spoke out against writing a sequel to his 1963 classic in a 2011 video interview with the Web site for the Tate museums in Britain: “Go to hell,” he said. “I’m not a whore.

He also recruits the first female Robin, Carrie Kelley. “The Dark Knight Returns” prompted a Batman revival that led to a series of movies in the 1980s and ’90s and more recently to Christopher Nolan’s three blockbusters about the character. “For fans of modern comics, this drawing is where everything really begins,” Todd Hignite, the vice president of Heritage Auctions, said in a statement.

Savory, pungent sausages seem to bond instantly with countless wines. Simply look for ones that are as elemental, casual and juicy as the sausages themselves. With Italian sausages, you’ll most likely want a red, and for warm-weather grilling it ought to enjoy a light chill. Translation: avoid tannins and oaky flavors. What does that leave? Only much of the low-priced red wine universe. Allow me to make a list, beginning in Italy: barbera, dolcetto, Valpolicella, Chianti, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, to name a few. If grilling French sausages, you might start with Beaujolais, or an easygoing Chinon or Bourgueil. But no need to get hung up on ethnicities. Look for an American gamay noir, or one of the good reds from the Canary Islands, or a dry rosé.

Buckminster Fuller coined the term “tensegrity,” for “tensional integrity,” a construction principle that led to a popular toy. Similarly, Dror Benshetrit, the designer of the Peacock chair from Cappellini, came up with a new truss that doubles as a diversion: four pieces of any material (like wood, metal or plastic) and four connectors of any kind (like screws, pegs or glue) that fold flat but open up to create four triangles. The QuaDror system of blocks is devilishly difficult to explain but easy to use; so easy, that prototypes disappeared. Thus was born a toy. Donald Rattner, the owner of the Module R art and design shop in Brooklyn, was strolling the International Gift Fair in New York in January and found the QuaDror blocks. The set ($36) consists of 10 trusses that can be assembled into anything in a child’s (or adult’s) imagination. Module R is at 141 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn.

Then Peter introduces Jesse to Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen, above with Mr. Radnor), an intellectually precocious 19-year-old drama student, and something clicks over the strains of Beethoven, Wagner, Vivaldi and Massenet. “ ‘Liberal Arts’ is a much stronger, more deeply felt film than Mr. Radnor’s debut, ‘Happythankyoumoreplease,’ ” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, but, “to quote the hard-boiled Judith, Mr. Radnor’s Jesse is gooey. The harder Mr. Radnor strains to make you love his alter ego, the more resistant you become. The last thing in the world you want to hear is Jesse congratulating himself for growing up, but toward the end of the movie that’s exactly what he does, with a gooey happy ending in sight.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html

2013-07-12,Rites of Passage,Tim Parks recounts Italian rail journeys and his encounters with people along the way.,"The British author Tim Parks has lived in Italy since 1981, commuting on his adopted country’s vast, various and ever changing networks of trains from Verona (where he first made his home) to Milan (where he now lives and still teaches). Parks was for many years married to an Italian and has three children, all born in Italy. He has written more than a dozen novels and 10 other books, including a handful of funny, appreciative and grousing memoirs about the particolari of daily life, Italian style. In the first of these, “Italian Neighbors,” he asked the reader to picture him as “a busy but inexpert fellow dashing about the narrow confines of his territory waving a net on the end of a long stick.” A “huge” net, he added. What did he hope to catch? “National character, a sense of place, the feeling people, place and weather generate.” In his new ­memoir-cum-travelogue, “Italian Ways,” Parks enlarges this net to fantastical dimensions in order to bag Italy’s sprawling, convoluted and (in a way) stupendous railway system and subject it to his scrutiny — on the theory, he explains to skeptics who don’t share his train mania, that any culture “manifests itself entirely in anything the people of that culture do.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/italian-ways-by-tim-parks.html

Some were dislocated from home and roots: many thousands fled their homeland during the years of Yugoslav Communism, with its informers, “eliminations” and prison camps. Others, who stayed on, were dislocated from their history as the Communist authorities rewrote the past, a process that continued during the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s. And dislocation, as always, extended into the psychological realm: timeless ideas of value and even truth were warped by decades of lies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/courtney-angela-brkics-first-rule-of-swimming.html

In “The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man Swamp,” aimed at middle-grade readers, Appelt returns to the folksy narrative voice of her beloved picture book, “Bubba and Beau, Best Friends.” Her mastery of pacing and tone makes for wonderful reading aloud, even to children who would happily take on a relatively long novel on their own. There is music in her prose: “For as long as raccoons had inhabited the Sugar Man Swamp, which was eons, they had been the Official Scouts, ordained by the Sugar Man himself back in the year Aught One, also known as the Beginning of Time.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/kathi-appelts-true-blue-scouts-of-sugar-man-swamp.html

Sarah Dessen, a seasoned young adult author, and the bold newcomer Leila Howland present readers with two different visions of sun and surf.

Now another “Star Wars” spinoff is making noise: “William Shakespeare’s Star Wars,” by Ian Doescher, is new at No. 12 on the hardcover fiction list. The book recasts the story of Luke and Leia and Darth Vader as a five-act play in iambic pentameter — because why not? — and it’s more entertaining than you might guess. (Here’s a sample couplet from the prologue: “In time so long ago begins our play / In star-crossed galaxy far, far away.”) In a phone interview, Doescher told me he came up with the idea last year, after watching the original “Star Wars” trilogy and attending the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in quick succession. “People ask me whether I see ‘Star Wars’ as a comedy or a tragedy,” he said, “but it’s really neither — it’s partly a history, like ‘Henry V,’ and partly a fantasy, like ‘The Tempest.’ ” He added that he was gratified, but not entirely surprised, by the book’s success: “Shakespeare is a popular market, and ‘Star Wars’ is a popular market,” he said. “It’s not like I was writing ‘Geoffrey Chaucer’s Ishtar.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

(Starz) CELESTE AND JESSE FOREVER (2012) Rashida Jones portrays Celeste, and Andy Samberg (above, with Ms. Jones) is Jesse, a young married couple in Los Angeles who have split up without moving on or out in this wistful romantic comedy for which Ms. Jones wrote the screenplay with Will McCormack. She plays a hard-driving trend forecaster who lives in the house they once shared; he is a laid-back artist who now flops in the backyard studio. Though they are best friends bound by the same adolescent humor, Jesse’s lack of ambition doesn’t allow the focused Celeste to stay with him. But she can’t quit him, either — until suddenly she must. “While ‘Celeste and Jesse’ is decidedly conventional in most respects, it’s pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman that’s no longer predicated by mutual desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. “Once upon a studio time, screwball comedy was where men and women redefined gender relations,” she added. “Equality between the sexes, or so it seems, turned out to be a joke killer, one reason bromances exist: if you can’t imagine women as equals, just sidestep them.” Here, she said, Ms. Jones and Mr. McCormack “have righted the sex imbalance of the bromance with a story about two people who, together and alone, express an ideal rarely seen in American movies: a man and a woman whose equality is burnished in friendship, not just in bed and marriage.” ",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

2013-07-18,What’s On Thursday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (BET) MANDELA: FREEDOM’S FATHER This “BET News Special” celebrates the 95th birthday of Nelson Mandela, above, chronicling his life through film clips and interviews. In Clint Eastwood’s “Invictus” (2009), at 9, Morgan Freeman stars as Mandela, newly elected as South Africa’s first black president. Matt Damon is Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks — and the vehicle, Mandela thinks, for bringing the country’s races together. A. O. Scott, reviewing this film in The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Freeman played Mandela — a role that earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor — “with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief,” and that Mr. Damon, nominated for best supporting actor, matches him “with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent).” He added: “ ‘Invictus’ has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss. It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html

The king was granted amnesty after three years and allowed to reclaim his throne. But Goujian swore off the trappings of monarchy, eating peasant food and living simply.

2013-07-19,Lawsuit Against Ex-President of Mexico Is Dismissed,The suit was filed against former President Ernesto Zedillo by 10 anonymous plaintiffs who said they were survivors of a 1997 massacre.," A United States District Court judge in Connecticut on Thursday dismissed a civil lawsuit against former President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico that was filed by 10 anonymous plaintiffs who said they were survivors of a 1997 assault. Judge Michael P. Shea said he was deferring to a request for immunity for Mr. Zedillo submitted by the State Department last year. The two-year-old lawsuit had sought $50 million in damages against Mr. Zedillo, who now leads a research institute at Yale University. Members of the indigenous group that was the target of the assault, known as Las Abejas, or the Bees, said they did not know the plaintiffs and disassociated themselves from the suit. Mr. Zedillo was president in 1997 when paramilitary gunmen fired on members of the group taking refuge from fighting in the southern state of Chiapas and killed 45 people, including 18 children.

2013-07-19,What’s On Friday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANÇOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, continues with “The Soft Skin” (1964). The movie shows Alfred Hitchcock’s influence on Truffaut, and his own preoccupation with the romantic triangle, through the story of a literary scholar (Jean Desailly), his wife (Nelly Benedetti) and the flight attendant (Françoise Dorléac) who comes between them. The lineup continues at 10 with “Jules and Jim” (1962), adapted from Henri-Pierre Roché’s 1953 semi-autobiographical novel and starring Jeanne Moreau as a tempestuous beauty who drives a wedge between college friends (Henri Serre, above center, and Oskar Werner, with Ms. Moreau). In “Two English Girls” (1972), at midnight, a young writer (Jean-Pierre Léaud, who served as Truffaut’s alter ego as a young man) carries on love affairs with two sisters (Kika Markham and Stacey Tendeter).

One day, everybody knows where you came from and where you’re going; the next, you don’t recognize a soul. VISITATION STREET (Dennis Lehane/Ecco/HarperCollins, $25.99), a powerfully beautiful novel by Ivy Pochoda, lingers on the moment the ­working-class neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn, changed forever: the night 15-year-old June Giatto went out into the Upper Bay in a pink raft with her best friend, Val Marino, and never returned. Nothing was the same after that: developers discovered the historic waterfront, initiating a gentrification that was swift and unstop-pable. Even the longshoremen’s bars had their history “buffed and polished away.” But on the night June disappeared, families still lived in the shabby row houses and worked at blue-collar jobs while their children dreamed of sailing away on a pink raft.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/ivy-pochodas-visitation-street-and-more.html
2013-07-19,They’ve Got a Secret,"The Bank for International Settlements, a central bank for bankers, operates without disclosure.","Adam LeBor’s history of the Bank for International Settlements, “Tower of Basel,” reads a little like a financial version of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” the Tom Stoppard play that places two minor characters in “Hamlet” in the forefront of the action while the drama’s major events unfold incomprehensibly in the background. In LeBor’s telling, the B.I.S., an obscure “bank for central banks” set up in Basel, Switzerland, in 1930 to facilitate World War I reparations payments from Germany, has been a critical, if secretive, actor in the global economy for more than 80 years. Today, he writes, it is “the most important bank in the world,” an institution with virtually no accountability, and yet “for decades it has stood at the center of a global network of money, power and covert global influence.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/tower-of-basel-by-adam-lebor.html
2013-07-19,Who She Knew,The formidable doyenne of 19th-century expatriate Florence.,"Janet Ross was one of those Lady Bracknell-like dragons for whom the word “formidable” was practically invented. Born in London in 1842, she spent the last six decades of her life — from 1867 until her death in 1927 — as an increasingly commanding personage in the Anglo-Tuscan colony around Florence, where she was known (and feared) as Aunt Janet. Ben Downing freely acknowledges near the beginning of “Queen Bee of Tuscany” that Ross “had her limitations. Though intelligent and learned, especially for an autodidact, she was by no means brilliant. She had little imagination or inner life, and she made no towering contribution to humanity.” Thus the biog­rapher throws down his own gauntlet: Why, then, are we reading about her?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/queen-bee-of-tuscany-by-ben-downing.html

There were honorary degrees (at least a dozen), prestigious prizes (wouldn’t you want a Thomas Jefferson Medal from the American Philosophical Society?) and conference after conference held in his honor. It’s customary for a distinguished professor to get a “Festschrift” of writings by students and disciples; Hirschman got four.

Regina is a 21-year-old graduate student taking literature classes at an unnamed East Coast university; Nicholas Brodeur is her celebrated professor, graced with “exceptional, even sinister, attractiveness.” Yet “My Education,” Choi’s fourth book, only feints toward the conventional novel, with the standard affair between student and professor. Just when Regina and Nicholas seem about to sleep together, he is superseded in Regina’s affections by his 33-year-old wife, Martha, on maternity leave from a teaching position at the same university. One night at a dinner party, Regina trails the older woman out the back door and kisses her, and we find ourselves on a less familiar campus than we’d thought.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/my-education-by-susan-choi.html

There he observed the deepening divide between the Arab north and the black Christian south, exacerbated by “demoralizing poverty” and the influence of militant Islam.

The woman, Jane Conrad, has been informed by a growing chorus of fellow officer wives that something has happened at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, where her husband, Pete, is a test pilot. Jane knows what something means. She can all but see Pete’s mangled, charred remains lying amid the palmetto grass, the smoking wreckage of his aircraft strewn about. As the minutes tick by, she grows increasingly panicked and calls the office of Pete’s squadron. They refuse to answer her questions. She hangs up and waits for her doorbell to ring, now certain of her fate. Her husband is dead. (We learn on the next page that he is, in fact, alive.

She was said to be Winston Churchill’s favorite spy — a considerable accolade given how much Britain’s wartime prime minister liked spies.

2013-07-20,What’s On Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) Jeremy Renner (above), replacing Matt Damon as the lead in this fourth installment, stars as the superspy Aaron Cross, on the run when the secret intelligence campaign (code name: Outcome) that produced him is compromised, leaving Cross and his fellow operatives to be eliminated under orders from a retired Air Force Colonel (Edward Norton). Rachel Weisz plays the geneticist who helped to create Cross and who may be his only hope for staying alive. While the director Tony Gilroy “retains some of the Bourne bequest, he’s also created a tricky parallel universe with a new agency that has its own clenched-jawed, closed-door complications and a hero who nearly becomes lost among them,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about these films inspired by the Robert Ludlum novels. But while some of the action here flows nicely, she added, the three previous movies “conveyed a sense of urgency that mirrored Bourne’s shattered being and his propulsive, convulsive journey from unenlightened self-interest to accountability, from the existential question mark of his identity to a hard moral reckoning.” Jason Bourne “was still trying to find the answers,” she said. “Now with Bourne gone, Mr. Gilroy needs to find other questions worth asking.” “The Bourne Identity” (2002), the first film in the series, will be shown on A&E at 8; “The Bourne Supremacy” (2004), the second, will be shown on Starz at 7:05.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The film “What the Bleep Do We Know!?” uses it to justify many articles of faith in New Age philosophy. Asserting that observing water molecules changes their molecular structure, the film reasons that since we are 90 percent water, physics therefore tells us that we can fundamentally change our nature via mental energy. Fundamentally inaccurate uses of the principle are also common in the academy, especially among social theorists, who often argue that it undermines science’s claims to objectivity and completeness. As Jim Holt has written, “No scientific idea from the last century is more fetishized, abused and misunderstood — by the vulgar and the learned alike — than Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.” ",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/nothing-to-see-here-demoting-the-uncertainty-principle/

At the Absolut Welcome Party, 16 rooms of the French Quarter’s historic Arnaud’s Restaurant were transformed into a maze of bespoke bars and boîtes, featuring punch-bowl fountains of such classic concoctions as the sea breeze, the corpse reviver and the honey pot. And at the closing day’s annual Pig & Punch fund-raiser, herbaceous Jagermeister and Barenjager Honey Liqueur punctuated flowing bowls of tequila and plum-wine punch.The colonial-era precursor to the cocktail has been enjoying a renaissance ever since the release of the cocktail historian David Wondrich’s 2010 book, “Punch: The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl.” Typically comprised of five ingredients (spirit, citrus, sugar, spice, water), punches have grown in popularity in part because of their low-maintenance preparation — all that’s required before serving is floating a giant ice cube in a massive bowl.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/all-the-rage-the-next-great-cocktail-craze-boozy-punches/

Grants Exclusivity to Plan B One-Step,The agency on Monday granted the maker of Plan B One-Step exclusive marketing rights for three years to sell the morning-after pill without a prescription for all ages.,"The manufacturer of the best-known morning-after pill, Plan B One-Step, has been granted exclusive marketing rights for three years by the Food and Drug Administration. The decision means that the drug maker, Teva Pharmaceuticals, is — for now — the only company able to sell the drug over-the-counter and without a prescription for all ages. Manufacturers of generic versions of the pill can apply to the F.D.A. for permission to sell their versions in drugstore aisles, instead of behind a pharmacy counter. Even if the approval is granted they would not be able to sell their products to those under 17 until the three-year exclusivity period for Plan B One-Step ends. Plan B One-Step retails for about $50; generics sell for at least $10 or $15 less. The F.D.A. decision Monday night follows the government’s decision last month to comply with a federal court order to lift age and sale restrictions on Plan B One-Step, which had been available without a prescription only for ages 17 and older.

The 74-year-old Republican senator William Borah, who had led the fight against Woodrow Wilson and American entry into the League of Nations in 1919, shook his head in disgust. “There is not going to be any war in Europe this year,” he said. “All this hysteria is manufactured and artificial.” Two months later Hitler invaded Poland, and England and France declared war on Germany.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/those-angry-days-and-1940.html

With hundreds of miles of sandstone and granite cliffs, cattail-lined riverbanks, former factory towns, orchards, farmland and forests, the scale of its geography and the scope of its history are daunting. To spend a weekend dropping into its musty bookstores and sizable art institutions or idling between hilltop castles, divey small-town bars and doily B&Bs is like skipping a stone into a river: you bounce along, but barely break the surface. From New York City, it’s a one-hour train trip to Peekskill, at the doorstep of the mid-Hudson Valley, but the region can be fully explored only on the kind of road trip that skirts one side of the river and winds down the other, hopscotching between historic estates and detouring for farm stands, roadside diners and seductive swimming holes.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/travel/36-hours-in-the-hudson-valley-new-york.html

But then Gilbert gave this screw a rather broad turn: what if one’s father were a “really mythical” writer along the lines of Salinger, “vivid on the page yet impenetrable in the flesh?” If one assumes that resembling Salinger entails not only reclusiveness but also rotten parenting skills (in his case, it depends on which child you ask), then the result would be a personage like A. N. Dyer, the impenetrable writer-father at the center of Gilbert’s novel, who leaves at least one of his sons wondering how a man could be so “funny and smart” in his work, and yet such a creep in person.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/david-gilberts-sons.html

This is unexpectedly arresting. We’re accustomed to memoirists working double time to keep our attention, giving jumped-up accounts of personal disasters while at the same time relentlessly trying to burrow their way into our hearts with lovable, self-deprecating personas. Memoir is a crowded genre, and memoirists too often behave accordingly.

In “The Hand That First Held Mine” and “The Distance Between Us,” characters separated by many miles or many years turn out to be joined in ways they never anticipated. In other books, like “The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox” and “After You’d Gone,” women confined to hospital wards slowly reveal secrets that both bind and unbind their families.

2013-07-26,"Gettysburg, Readdressed",Scenes from the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.,"The Battle of Gettysburg, a turning point in the Civil War, was fought in July 1863 over three days of unrelenting heat, smoke and death. “The ground was soaked with the blood of as brave men as ever fell on the red field of battle,” a Confederate colonel recalled. This month, 150 years later, thousands gathered to watch re-enactments of the battle, including Pickett’s Charge, a disastrous move for the Confederates, seen on the following pages. Allen Baldwin, who played the role of the Union commander, says everything was carefully scripted and rehearsed. The characters who “died” were chosen in advance, some based on their birth month, and had to stay dead for the battle’s duration, sometimes as long as an hour. Re-enactments are intense experiences, Baldwin says. “Guys are paying honor to their ancestors, and there’s a lot of emotion.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/gettysburgreaddressed.html

Cohen of insider trading, but it did the next best thing by indicting his firm, SAC Capital Advisors.

Giovanni Ribisi is the narrator, a grown version of one of the adoring boys with whom the sisters communicate in their isolation by means of light signals and songs over the phone. “Ms. Coppola has carefully preserved the spirit of her source and, for the most part, succeeded in her efforts to find a visual idiom appropriate to the lush melancholy of the novel’s language,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The book, “a hazy linguistic daydream,” he added, required, “Ms. Coppola to create a feature film essentially without characters or a story, and to hold the viewer’s interest through moods, associations and resonant images.
