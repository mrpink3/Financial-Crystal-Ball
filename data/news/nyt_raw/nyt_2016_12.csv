It attracted scientists, the news industry and entertainers. It generated its own forms of commerce, wealth and celebrity and, for a while, inspired its own architecture, the luxurious movie palace. It was itself the focus of constant innovation, from the advent of sound, color and 3-D, to digitalization, which let smartphones and other devices incorporate both filmless cameras and small screens — hand-held movie palaces. And from the very beginning, creative people of all types grasped the cinema as an artistic outlet that would transform traditional storytelling and popular culture while giving a new focus to the international avant-garde.

Not how it was done, the great writer insisted. “The Duelist,” a Russian-made picture about a former nobleman making his living as a proxy in honor-restoring matches of shooting skill, never shows such a duel. In this movie, directed by Aleksey Mizgirev and set in 1860 St. Petersburg, the fighters meet at close range, sometimes stand separated by a screen, and face off in other visually interesting ways.

2016-12-02,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"Paulo Coelho’s “The Spy,” a fictional retelling of the life of Mata Hari, is No.18 on the extended hardcover fiction list.","In Bed: We can affectionately tease Paulo Coelho, right? For one thing, the man seems impervious to it — his novel “The Alchemist,” after all, has sold more than 65 million copies even though it’s essentially a collection of motivational bromides. (“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are.” This meets the fortune cookie test: It would be improved by adding “in bed.”) For another thing, Coelho seems to be in on the joke. Here’s part of the biographical note from his latest novel, “The Spy,” new at No. 18 on the extended hardcover fiction list: “He has flirted with death, escaped madness, dallied with drugs, withstood torture, experimented with magic and alchemy, studied philosophy and religion, read voraciously, lost and recovered his faith, and experienced the pain and pleasure of love. In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces.” If this isn’t meant at least 50 percent in jest — again, it helps to append “in bed” to each item — then Coelho’s pharmacological dalliance may not be entirely a thing of the past.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

Whitewashed brick walls contain a barroom and a bilevel dining room decorated simply, with a nod to midcentury modern. Mr. Kluger’s food is seasonal and market driven. And it builds on his experience working with chefs like Floyd Cardoz at Tabla, which shapes the flavors in his suckling pig and on his cauliflower with Indian seasonings, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten at ABC Kitchen, which inspired a vegetable focus on the menu.

But there are two things I recall with exceptional clarity: Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow (the hunger, the cold, the sleeping bags made of horse carcasses), and the opening soliloquy of “Richard III,” which I was required to memorize for English class at 16. I took this request very seriously, because I was not cool, and I spent many days slinking up and down the corridors hissing, “I am determined to prove a villain” to myself and narrowing my eyes.

At highflier temples of Montreal gastronomy like Au Pied de Cochon (and at New York outposts, like M. Wells Steakhouse in Queens), you’ll find a great variety of meats in the tourtières, and occasionally slices of truffle or coins of foie gras. The classic accompaniment is a fruit ketchup or green-tomato relish, something piquant and bright against the rich, cinnamon-and-clove-scented taste of the meat, the vague porkiness of the dough.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/a-french-canadian-christmas-carol.html

All of which is to say: When I told my wife that Lauren Graham, who played Lorelai Gilmore, would be appearing at the 92nd Street Y in New York to promote her memoir, “Talking as Fast as I Can” (new at No. 3 on the hardcover nonfiction list), we were there in a trice. Picture William Shatner speaking to a crowd of “Star Trek” fans, only 98 percent female, and you’ll get the idea: lots of fellowship and laughter and screaming, with the center of attention gamely baffled and entertained by it all. “I love you, Lauren!” one woman shouted, and Graham, grinning widely at the sea of cellphone flash bulbs, deadpanned, “I love your adherence to ‘The use of photography is strictly prohibited.’ ”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

(It’s currently No. 14.) Abrams, who conceived and helped write the book, is taking some liberties here in the name of comedy — he actually identifies as secular despite his Jewish roots, and the participants really met not in a bar but in the Dalai Lama’s residence in Dharamsala, India, over the course of a week last year. But when the subject is joy, a little humor is allowed. “See if you can chuckle at your problem, at your shortcomings, at your frailties,” the book advises toward the end. “Even if it is a very grave or serious situation, there is often some humor that can be found. The human drama is often a comedy, and laughter is the saving grace.” (O.K., so those sentences are themselves strikingly earnest and humorless. But do as they say, not as they do.)",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

It is not good (even Rollin nuts rate it low), but I checked it out again to see if there was some Christmas or holiday theme I’d missed before. No dice.

It tells of a Portuguese Jesuit priest, Father Rodrigues, who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan, where Christians are being persecuted — boiled alive, immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan, a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God.

Over the decades these types have changed their looks and histories, but there’s a sameness to how they escape the law and the routine hum of everyday life; how they use guns ruthlessly or reluctantly; skip out on church yet live by their own moral code; and inevitably rise to become masters of their worlds, as well as of the most beautiful women in the room.

It was moving casually, but casual for a waterborne marine creature is still pretty fast. When it finally noticed my sister cruising through a space where humans normally are not, it pulled up, coming to a sudden halt, vertical in the water. The sea lion looked amazed and delighted — at least, that’s how it looked to me, looking at my sister — and at that moment, the thing I wanted most in the world was to learn how to hold my breath and dive deep long enough so that I might also startle and amaze someone, or something, like a sea lion.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-not-breathing.html

The truly appropriate snow is somewhere where there is not a freeze-and-thaw cycle. That kind of weather destroys the structural integrity of the snow.” But even though ideal igloo-making environments are closer to the polar regions, it’s not impossible to replicate good conditions elsewhere.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/magazine/how-to-build-an-igloo.html

I still like the little guy.”","Star Power: This week’s lists reflect book sales for the period ending Dec. 24, which means you’ll find lots of famous novelists on the fiction side of the ledger: In publishing as in home electronics, brand names sell well for the holidays. They know it, too. Here’s John Grisham — whose thriller “The Whistler” remains No. 1 in its ninth week on the hardcover fiction list — describing his target audience in a November interview with Slate: “First of all, she’s female, because two-thirds of all books are bought by women. She’s going to buy it during the Christmas season, because 35 percent of all books are sold during the Christmas season. I would guess she’s probably going to be over 40, because they buy more books than under 40. And that kind of narrows it down. That’s probably my typical reader.” In the same interview, Grisham said he often writes from a sense of injustice about a given subject — don’t be surprised if he tackles student debt in a future thriller — and he gave vent, just a bit, to his political views. The short version: He doesn’t think much of Donald Trump. The slightly longer, more diplomatic version: “I still pull for the underdog. I still like the little guy, especially when the little guy is getting screwed by the big guy: the government, a corporation, an issue, whatever. . . . But you’ve got to be careful with your audience, because they don’t always share my politics. You can’t be intrusive with your politics in popular fiction, when you’re trying to entertain people.

2016-12-30,Does It Pay to Buy a House in the Suburbs?,"For some first-time buyers, renting might actually be cheaper, both in the short- and long-term.","Q. My husband and I are in our 30s and used to rent in Brooklyn. After we had a baby, we moved to the suburbs. We’re now thinking about buying a house, but I can’t wrap my mind around how it would be financially advantageous.
