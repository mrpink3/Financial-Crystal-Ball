Her versatile, just-conceptual-enough pieces — in particular, her signature chain bracelet, a stretchy length of articulated gold — made fast fans of powerful women like the Olsen twins. When her father died, she inherited the business, and in 2014 she opened a second shop in New York. Now, she’s expanding her horizons further by introducing a collaboration with the Nigerian-born clothing designer Duro Olowu. To hear the pair tell it, the idea was hatched casually over dinner and carried out almost effortlessly; indeed, the resulting capsule collection is an easy, seamless blend of two aesthetics: Upper East Side meets citizen of the world. “We really have the same taste,” says Olowu, whose drapey printed dresses have their own passionate fan base. They agreed that lapis — a relatively humble, deceptively lightweight blue stone that Olowu describes as luminous and seasonless — should anchor the collection, which includes a chunky ring, sinuous lariats and a bold, studded cuff, all set in gleaming gold and available at Neidich’s Madison Avenue store.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/t-magazine/fashion/jewelry-collaboration-duro-olowu-sidney-garber.html

Pretor-Pinney anticipated all the jokes: that he’d burned out running a magazine devoted to doing nothing, and so on. But it was true. Getting the magazine out was taxing, and after a decade, it seemed appropriate to stop for a while and live without a plan — to be an idler himself and shake free space for fresh ideas. So he swapped his flat in London for one in Rome, where everything would be new and anything could happen.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/the-amateur-cloud-society-that-sort-of-rattled-the-scientific-community.html

2016-05-04,A Cookie Bouquet From a Cult Brooklyn Baker and Two Perfumers,Régime des Fleurs collaborated with Burrow bakery’s Ayako Kurokawa on an uplifting creation.,"Fascinated by “impossible bouquets,” the Dutch Baroque still-life paintings that took years to complete because each flower could only be painted while in season, the Régime des Fleurs perfumers Alia Raza and Ezra Woods have recreated the art form — with a treat for the senses. “It’s our goal to bring a sense of floralcy to everything — that includes food,” Raza says. Their first foray into “edible experiences” was with Timelapse, a fragrance made with food-grade botanical extractions and alcohol — available in the Régime des Fleurs Spritz, a gin-prosecco cocktail at Dimes. Now the duo has collaborated with Burrow bakery’s Ayako Kurokawa on a scented and flavored cookie, as part of Régime des Fleurs’s ongoing Artefact program of collaborations. “We used essences that can be used for both perfumery and flavoring,” says Woods. “It’s meant to be tasty but subtle — and hard to put your finger on.” The dough and icing are subtly infused with notes of bergamot, orange, elderflower and almond to conjure up the uplifting feelings Kurokawa’s hand-painted watercolor-like bouquets represents. Each cookie is made to order in Brooklyn, and takes about a day and a half to complete.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/t-magazine/food/cookie-bouquet-brooklyn-regime-des-fleurs-burrow-bakery.html

2016-05-04,A Revolutionary Garden Designer Finally Gets a Retrospective,“Roberto Burle Marx: Brazilian Modernist” opens Friday at the Jewish Museum — and goes beyond the artist’s landscapes.,"When the Brazilian painter Roberto Burle Marx started to design gardens in the early 1930s, landscape architecture wasn’t considered much of a discipline. The recognizable geometric shapes, stringent symmetry and acceptable flora established in French gardens had remained unchallenged for centuries; Burle Marx abandoned the rigid layouts and began to use local plants. Importantly, he treated these projects as a form of art. “The flowers and the plants were his brushes and his colors, and the landscape became the canvas,” says Jens Hoffmann, the deputy director of exhibitions and public programs at the Jewish Museum. “And there was an added dimension of time.

The Prince’s premises are that France must, sooner or later, recognize that ‘‘the empire is precisely the ‘République autoritaire,’ organized, reconciled and fortified by stability.’’ This recognition will be forced upon the nation by the discredit of parliamentary Republicanism, the existing form of government in France being ‘‘an oppressive and confused oligarchy, in which the deputies wrangle for fleeting power.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 6, 1891",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/1891-victor-napoleons-program/

Around the world, on social media and in the press, opponents blasted Amnesty. In Los Angeles, protesters ringed the lobby of the Sheraton where the conference was being held, and as Muñoz tried to enter, a woman confronted her and became upset as Muñoz explained that, as a former sex worker, she supported Amnesty’s position. “She agreed to respect my time at the microphone,” Muñoz told me. “That didn’t exactly happen” — the woman and other critics yelled out during her panel — “but I understand why it was so hard for her.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/should-prostitution-be-a-crime.html

In the two years since she had moved to Paris from Copenhagen, where she was born, Karina had gone from being penniless on the streets to an in-demand model. After Godard cast her in “Le Petit Soldat,” she quickly became an emblem of the French New Wave through her performances in Godard’s films — and also his wife and muse. Their relationship was, by all accounts, tumultuous, and they divorced in 1965. But the films, and especially Karina’s performances, have only gained in esteem over time. “I could be their grandmother,” she says with a smile about the fans that still approach her. In a recent conversation before an event in her honor at the Brooklyn Academy of Music earlier this week (she’ll also appear at Film Forum tomorrow to kick off a series dedicated to her work with Godard), Karina talked about her early days modeling, how she got her name and the pleasure and pain of her time with Godard.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/t-magazine/entertainment/anna-karina-actress-interview-film-forum.html

Since then, after early attempts at concealing his face, he has gone public and collaborated with Skrillex, A-Trak and Kaskade.

2016-05-06,An Art Show That Addresses the Economic Collapse Head-On,Josh Kline’s “Unemployment” uses a variety of media to explore the effects of the mortgage crisis and recession on real people.,"As an artist who matured during the rise of the so-called “attention economy” — which has rewarded practices that combine a miscellany of ingredients into sometimes tenuous works of art — Josh Kline’s anticipated new solo show at 47 Canal gallery demonstrates how a little editing and restraint can elevate unnerving sculptures to an indelible mise-en-scène.

2016-05-10,A Spring Asparagus Dish From London’s Beloved River Café,"Ahead of her appearance at the Edible Schoolyard NYC spring benefit this month, the restaurant’s chef and owner Ruth Rogers shares a recipe with T.","Ruth Rogers, the vivacious restaurateur who traded Woodstock for London almost 50 years ago, is stationed in the shiny, open-plan kitchen of her Georgian terrace home. Sunshine streams into the double-height living space, where no fewer than eight sash windows look out onto a palatial Chelsea Square. Today, the celebrated chef and proprietor of what is surely the city’s most cherished Italian dining room, the River Café, is wearing a knitted dress in shocking pink (the favorite hue of her husband, the architect Richard Rogers). On the far wall, a smudgy Cy Twombly canvas hangs above a row of ceramics. The unglazed vessels look very Edmund de Waal, but in fact are the creation of Rogers’s mother-in-law, Dada, who first taught her to cook. “Edmund de Waal admired them when he came to dinner,” says Rogers of the ceramicist’s handiwork, as she scales a ladder to reach a vertiginous kitchen cupboard. The whisk she procures proves essential in the day’s delicious agenda: the preparation of white and green asparagus served with a sparkly take on a traditional Bagna Cauda (meaning “hot bath”) sauce. Here, the red wine that typically makes up this centuries-old northern Italian recipe, featuring garlic and anchovies, is swapped for Prosecco (the full recipe for which is detailed below).",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/t-magazine/food/asparagus-recipe-london-river-cafe.html

2016-05-10,National Briefing,News and updates from around the country.,"The American Counseling Association announced Tuesday that it was canceling plans to hold a conference in Nashville next March to protest a new Tennessee law that allows therapists to decline to see patients based on religious values and personal principles. The group has condemned the law as a “hate bill” that discriminates against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and as an unprecedented attack on its profession. No other state has passed such a law, the group said, vowing to work to get it repealed and to keep similar measures from passing around the country. The conference would have brought 3,500 to 4,000 to Nashville, said the counseling association’s chief executive, Richard Yep, and generated what Nashville’s Convention and Visitors Corporation estimated as $2.5 million in direct spending and $444,609 in tax revenue for the city and state. Nashville’s mayor and tourist officials feared the city could face a backlash because of a law that it did not create or support. This is the second group to cancel a convention in Nashville because of the law, Bonna Johnson, a spokeswoman for the convention and visitors group, said in an email. She would not identify the other group. State Senator Jack Johnson, a Republican who sponsored the bill, has said counselors must refer patients they decline to treat to another therapist and must treat those seen as an immediate danger to themselves or others.

Finally, after a flare-up in the summer of 2010, Grace was referred to a specialist, an ear doctor who felt something amiss on the left side of her throat: a lump. The Silva family agreed that it was time to get Grace, then 54, to a thyroid specialist. Grace’s daughter Melanie tracked down the name of one at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a 90-­minute drive from Grace’s brown clapboard split-­level near New Bedford, Mass. In September 2010, the specialist delivered the diagnosis: anaplastic thyroid cancer. It was bad, he warned her, and she would need surgery. Grace’s other daughter, Karrie, was marrying in a few weeks. “Can’t it wait?” Grace asked. It could not. “And whatever you do,” the specialist said, “please don’t look it up on the Internet.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/magazine/exceptional-responders-cancer-the-lazarus-effect.html

In the process, he became deeply invested, heart and mind, in saving the Amazonian paradise that surrounded him; fought to halt its devastation; and turned his home near Rio into a botanical rescue farm, a sanctuary for one of the world’s largest collections of tropical plants.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/arts/design/review-revisiting-the-constructed-edens-of-roberto-burle-marx.html

2016-05-13,Inside the List,"Don DeLillo, at No. 13 on the hardcover fiction list, avoids shoptalk with writer friends: “When I talk to novelists, we tend to talk about movies.”","Cowboys: Don DeLillo’s 16th novel, “Zero K,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 13. In a recent Q. and A. with The Los Angeles Times, DeLillo counted the book among the three most significant of his career. (The others were also best sellers: “Libra” spent five weeks on the list in 1988, and “Underworld” had a 10-week run in 1997-98.) DeLillo is well known for his attention to the music and even the visual appearance of his sentences: “The words typed on the white page have a sculptural quality,” he told The Paris Review in 1993. But to judge from his interview with The Los Angeles Times, this devotion to craft doesn’t extend to shoptalk with writer friends. “When I talk to novelists, we tend to talk about movies,” he said. “It’s true. It’s much easier to talk about. I just don’t talk much about my work with other writers, and I don’t talk much about their work. A few sentences. We’re like two characters in an old western movie in which the main element, the main audio element is to be very laconic. That’s what happens when I talk about writing with other writers.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Now that women’s liberation is cool again, now that the f-word is cropping up on billboards, catwalks and talk shows, the pressing question is how far radical feminists can allow the mainstream to co-opt our movement without cheapening the message.

The city’s police board announced Tuesday that the officer, Dante Servin, who was off duty when he shot Rekia Boyd in 2012, resigned two days before a hearing at which the board was to decide if he should be fired. Ms. Boyd, 22, was walking with friends on a street when Mr. Servin told them to be quiet. He said he had fired because he had seen a person moving toward him with a gun, but the police found only a cellphone at the scene. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter, but a judge acquitted him, saying Mr. Servin had been improperly charged, and suggested that if the act was intentional, then the crime, “if any there be, is first-degree murder.” The city settled a lawsuit in 2013 with the Boyd family for $4.5 million.

Yet I’ve never forgotten how different the experience of listening to prose is from reading or watching it transformed into film. It requires time and a mental stillness, the kind one has these days mainly in cars or other modes of transit.

2016-05-18,Scarlett Johansson’s Latest: Narration of ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’,Two recordings give voice to classic tales from the children’s canon. ,"Being read to is one of life’s best small luxuries, but it was until very recently reserved for children and a few select adults. Now any grown-up with a smartphone has tens of thousands of audiobooks readily at her disposal in the car, gym, kitchen or bed. The appeal of listening to a book is still, however, much entangled with deep memories of slipping under a parent’s arm to have a story unfolded for you in a beloved voice. Is it any wonder, then, that the most celebrated audiobook narrators — in particular, Jim Dale, who has read the Harry Potter series for at least three generations of fans — acquire their own devout followings? The peculiar intimacy of modern audiobook narration (with earbuds, the narrator’s voice seems to emanate from inside the listener’s head) intensifies the old association with cozying up with Mom or Dad and a bedtime book. These performers may be unknown to the culture at large, but among the initiated they are adored; they could teach psychotherapists a thing or two about ­transference.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/books/review/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-and-grimms-fairy-tales.html

Eventually the infrastructure improved so that there were no limits to how much text we could transmit at once.

His statement was the strongest yet in a series of pronunciations by top U.S. officials indicating a change in attitude toward China. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey recently advocated the ‘‘containment without isolation’’ of China. Mr. McNamara said there were practical alternatives to the current U.S. relationships with both China and the Soviet Union. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, May 19, 1966",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/1966-building-bridges-to-peace/

2016-05-18,National Briefing,News and updates from around the country.,"Under fire from the governor and many Republican legislators, the state Department of Education now says it will not follow new federal guidance on use of bathrooms and locker rooms by transgender students. State Superintendent Carey Wright announced Wednesday that the department would “follow the lead of state leadership” and take no action until the state Board of Education could discuss the situation. The move comes as Republicans in a number of other states have opposed the guidance, with some seeking to join legal challenges. Mississippi education officials had said Friday they would follow the guidance by federal authorities calling for transgender students to be treated consistently with their gender identity. They cited a need for a “safe and caring school environment.” The State Board of Education chairman, John Kelly of Gulfport, said that board would have a special meeting within the next two weeks to discuss the issue. The move came as opposition to Ms. Wright’s earlier announcement that she would comply turned into a landslide. Wednesday, 27 Republican state senators among the 32-member Republican supermajority sent a letter to her and the Board of Education calling for “swift and decisive action on this urgent matter.” (AP)",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/national-briefing.html

Often signing their efforts simply Le Nain, they elevated genre painting with dignified depictions of peasants usually seated, motionless, in landscapes or plain interiors. Odd in scale, spatial illusion and gravity of mood, these images are fittingly painted in a solid, workmanlike style and are startlingly prescient of 19th-century French artists like Courbet and Manet. Collective anonymity has always seemed appropriate to the way the Le Nain brought painting down to earth, but this rare overview of 44 paintings — including less radical religious works — also presents new scholarship regarding which brother did what.

The scene is disgusting, of course; but it also serves, rather cleverly, as something of a thesis statement. Before the movie is over, that emesis won’t be the only salvo hurled by a woman in the direction of a man.

The crop they grow is an anchor of the local economy, as well as a potential source of cocaine for the world market. As such, it was a target of United States eradication efforts, which hurt the growers but formed the basis of a comfortable relationship for the governing class, consisting of descendants of Spanish colonialists. That was the arrangement until 2005, when Evo Morales, a coca labor leader from the Aymara tribe, was lifted to the presidency on the shoulders of the nation’s indigenous majority.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/movies/a-moment-of-silence-review.html

2016-05-20,Inside the List,"Louise Erdrich, whose novel “LaRose” is No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list, says getting humor into her work is “the hardest thing.”","Tragicomedy Central: If you were compiling a list of America’s funniest novelists, you might not think to include Louise Erdrich. That’s no knock against her: Erdrich’s richly layered books, dealing with subjects from rape to war to marital strife to racism, have rightly placed her in the top ranks of the literary pantheon. They just haven’t earned her a reputation for, you know, humor. So it’s striking that reviewers of her latest novel, “LaRose” — new at No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list — have singled out what Mary Gordon, in these pages, described as “this serious novel’s unexpected comedy.” (Gordon cited a scene in which the residents of an assisted-living home tamper with a villain’s medicine to give him “an unstoppable erection and uncontrollable diarrhea.” This in a book about the shooting death of a 5-year-old boy.) In a profile for Erdrich’s hometown newspaper, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, the journalist Laurie Hertzel also praised the story’s comic elements. “Oh, good,” Erdrich said. “I was looking over my notebook a while back, and I had this giant note in the middle of my pages. And it said: ‘Problem. Big problem. There is no humor whatsoever in this manuscript.’ It’s the hardest thing, writing humor into a book. But it’s also essential. I just don’t feel like I’ve got a book unless there’s something funny in it.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html

James Joyce taught me I was wrong.","This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.” Its genesis was long and tortuous — Joyce began writing his novel in 1904 — and the road to its canonisation as one of the seminal works of Western literature was not short either: The reviews spoke of the author’s “cloacal obsession” and “the slime of foul sewers,” comments that seem strange today, insofar as it is the subjective aspect of the book, the struggle that goes on inside the mind of its young protagonist, that perhaps stands out to us now as its most striking feature. What appeared at the time to be unprecedented about the novel seems more mundane to us today, whereas what then came across as mundane now seems unprecedented. Joyce’s novel remains vital, in contrast to almost all other novels published in 1916, because he forcefully strived toward an idiosyncratic form of expression, a language intrinsic to the story he wanted to tell, about the young protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, and his formative years in Dublin, in which uniqueness was the very point and the question of what constitutes the individual was the issue posed.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/magazine/on-reading-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man.html

As an adult, I don’t subscribe to any religion. My immediate family, however, continues to be deeply religious and very much adheres to what I now believe are extreme views. They are, of course, free to worship as they please. I, however, take issue with the hypocrisy in their own lives. For example, they are strongly anti-choice, yet one had an abortion during a complicated pregnancy. They are “pro-family,” yet gave up an adopted child that became “too difficult.” They boycotted a parental wedding because the bride and groom were each previously married; participating would have “blessed the sin.” There is also a personal aspect for me in that they openly oppose L.G.B.T. rights, support politicians and groups that are extremely anti-gay, attend schools that require opposition to gay civil liberties in their codes of conduct and belong to anti-gay churches. I’m openly gay. I have been told that I am not welcome in certain family members’ homes because of my “lifestyle choice.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/how-do-i-explain-to-my-evangelical-relatives-why-i-avoid-family-functions.html

The Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for two compounds: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in the manufacture of Teflon and other nonstick substances, and the related perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). An E.P.A. health advisory is not a regulation; it is nonbinding and nonenforceable. It does, however, require a public water system to notify its customers of the presence of the chemical and the dangers it poses. As a result, the E.P.A.’s announcement had immediate effects. Within hours, public wells were shut down in Horsham, Pa., and Maricopa County, Ariz. West Virginia’s Bureau for Public Health ordered a “do not drink” advisory for the water in three communities: Parkersburg, the site of a Teflon factory that until recently was operated by DuPont; the adjacent town of Vienna; and Martinsburg, four hours east, near the Maryland border. The West Virginia National Guard sent convoys of tankers containing drinking water to Vienna.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/magazine/the-story-behind-the-epas-contaminated-water-revelation.html
