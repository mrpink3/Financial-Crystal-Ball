Roosevelt in 1932 would have disagreed violently about what that program was.

In his obituary, The Times contrasted the two men, saying: “Where Dr. King could deliver thunderous oratory and move audiences by his reasoned convictions and faith, Mr. Shuttlesworth was fiery.” He was, the author Diane McWhorter told The Times, “King’s most effective and insistent foil: blunt where King was soothing, driven where King was leisurely, and most important, confrontational where King was conciliatory.” The segregationist commissioner of public safety in Birmingham, Bull Connor, saw Shuttlesworth as his nemesis. When asked about chest injuries Shuttlesworth incurred from being sprayed by a fire hose at close range during a peaceful protest, Connor told The Times: “I wish they’d carried him away in a hearse.”",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/fred-shuttlesworth-black-christianity.html

Each time she raised the drink to her lips, another writer, editor or publicist came along to distract her from it. Kawakami, who is 46, greeted them each with a degree of warmth that made it hard to tell which were strangers and which were her friends. “I’m a graduate of hostess university,” she said, recalling her years spent working at a bar where she kept men company as they drank. More than two decades later, the skills she honed in the boozy, neon-lit back alleys of Osaka — the ability to observe and to listen with acute curiosity — are still apparent in her best-selling novels. “You can see where that sensitivity arises from in her work,” the translator David Boyd told me. “She sees all the angles.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/magazine/mieko-kawakami.html

For regular people — people with everyday problems, who don’t live in a fancy observatory surrounded by brass astrolabes — the winter solstice is a weekly event happening every Sunday. Sunday evenings are black holes from which no hope escapes; a time of rumination on the failures of the past seven days, and pre-emptive haunting by fiascos to come. Yet the universe has been known to attenuate misery with fleeting comforts: the sensation of incredible warmth that overtakes a body dying of hypothermia, for instance.

Houston recorded “I’m Every Woman” for the soundtrack of “The Bodyguard” (1992), which she co-executive produced, and which secured her megastardom such that “the wonderment of her talent and her career impacted everyone,” as her sister-in-law and estate executor, Pat Houston, puts it.

It’s a little bit of a scramble to get out the door, but I can’t wake up without taking a shower. I’ll use Éminence Monoi Age Corrective Exfoliating Cleanser, followed by Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum and Dior Prestige La Crème. I try to slather myself in those, and then another big slather of Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream and Carmex Classic Lip Balm. I don’t wash my hair every day but, when I do, I use Alba Botanica So Smooth Gardenia Conditioner. (I don’t use shampoo.) I always scrunch Kiehl’s Creme With Silk Groom into wet hair and then wind it up with these discontinued Scunci Clips to set — I’ve resorted to buying them on eBay. I started pinning my hair up to control the curl, and now it’s become my signature. It is pretty healthy because it’s tucked away all the time but, when it starts to feel gangly, I’ll snip it myself. I almost never wear makeup because my day starts so early. If I do, I’ll do a cat eye with Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, Diorshow Mascara and, sometimes, Rouge Dior 999 lipstick. Other lipsticks I rotate in are Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick and Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. I’ll use Weleda Gentle Cleansing Milk to wash it off at night and, sometimes, I use this Borghese Purifying Mud Mask — I’ve had a jar of that forever. I don’t get massages enough, but I need to. I threw out my back recently, and a massage at Element spa in Brooklyn helped me get back on my feet. A lot of my team has favorite hand creams that are around the studio, one being Aesop Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, so I’ll use those. One thing I use often is this hand wash that is used to remove sap and resin. The filth if we don’t wear gloves is incredible, it just gets into your pores, and this really removes it. Working with flowers and sometimes rotting flowers, I like to be aware of smells, so I don’t wear fragrance very often. What I do love to wear is Hermès Eau d’Orange Verte.

Shouldn’t you be focused on the road? he texted, flirtatiously. Last fall, a different friend matched on Tinder with the great-grandson of Eva Perón’s bodyguard. Another friend, who insists any app with a chat function can be a dating app, hooked up with the driver dispatched to bring him socks he ordered online after some DMing about delivery instructions got steamy.

A self-made business titan, the founder of Paramount Global, whose holdings included Viacom and CBS, Redstone spent his 90s obsessively manipulating the people around him as they sought to manipulate him. The authors, the New York Times journalists James B. Stewart and Rachel Abrams, allow us to observe him from an almost uncomfortably intimate distance. (At times, I felt as if I were hiding in Redstone’s closet, peering out at the ugly absurdities unfolding.) The writing is elegant and the story so weird and compelling — I lost some sleep unable to put this book down — that the reader may be the only witness to this spectacle who never feels manipulated.

For how else are we to think of the guests who flex their power from the moment they stalk into the dining room; who frown at the table they’re led to, aggrieved at the imagined underestimation of their status, and insist on moving to another, often identical table; who try to meddle with the kitchen, demanding that the chef subtract and substitute ingredients, to the point of creating entirely new dishes; who wrinkle their noses at a perfectly fine bottle of wine and declare it corked, just to pull rank on the sommelier; who snap their fingers at servers, leer, sneer or scream, “You can’t do your job,” a line attributed to the actor and late-night host James Corden last fall over a flubbed order at the downtown Manhattan brasserie Balthazar; who tip stingily or not at all, ignoring the fact that, in the United States, the federal minimum wage for tipped employees is only $2.13 an hour; or who book a table and then don’t bother to show up, as happens with as many as 28 percent of all reservations, according to a 2021 survey by YouGov and OpenTable, and which can cost a small restaurant hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars, if not an entire night’s profit?",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/t-magazine/restaurants-hostile-eating-out.html

When Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has barred the new Advanced Placement course in African American studies from the state’s public schools. When legislatures are passing so-called “divisive concept” laws that further marginalize already marginalized histories, mandating that educators cannot teach about systemic racism or hold discussions about race that might cause students to feel “discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress.” With my own work often at the center of the legislative bans, I’ve thought a lot about how the word “white” in front of “students” is implied in these laws. What about the discomfort of Black children that results from what isn’t taught, the distress Black children experience when searching for themselves in an American story from which their people are largely absent, a story in which they learn about the great white men who lived in the White House but not the enslaved Africans who built it?",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/books/review/tami-charles-bryan-collier-we-are-here-kwame-alexander-dare-coulter-an-american-story.html

Hoping she’d agree to paint the film’s poster, Guadagnino had sent Peyton an early cut — the artist had made a piece based on an earlier work of his, 2018’s “Elio, Oliver (Call Me by Your Name),” which depicts a scene from his 2017 movie, “Call Me by Your Name.” Through all the gore, Peyton found “Bones and All” beautiful and was inspired to make a series of works. “It was clear that it was a love story,” says Peyton, “and that love was very hard but totally worth it.” The image that ended up on the poster portrays Russell and her co-star Timothée Chalamet in meaty pinks and bruised purples, zoomed in on to the point of semiabstraction.

Earlier in the day, a judge updated a court order giving police officers the authority to return him involuntarily to psychiatric care. He had been roaming campus intermittently for a week, shouting profanities at bystanders, creating a disturbance at the Wolverines’ opening football game, insulting police officers and raging about the U.S. Army and the C.I.A.

For her debut, she looked to an old favorite for inspiration: Eero Saarinen’s Miller House and Garden, which “represents the modernity, simplicity and openness that I value in my clothing design,” she says. Located in Columbus, Ind., the midcentury modern home features a single-story open layout ideal for communal gatherings, as well as details meant to enhance the individual dwellers’ day-to-day lives. “I love the idea of this house being a space that is intensely personal, but is also a really beautiful home for entertaining,” says Giardina. Similarly, the wardrobe she created is for “both private and public moments.” (An organic Supima cotton track pant and matching tunic work just as well for lounging at home as they do under the brand’s blazers for the office.) The cushions that adorn the house’s famous conversation pit provided a palette of saturated reds, creams and pinks, while the garden, designed by Dan Kiley, offered a range of fern, olive and sage greens and lilac-tinted blues for Giardina to draw from. (Saarinen and Kiley also collaborated on the St. Louis Arch, in Giardina’s hometown.) Another aim of the spring collection was to expand Another Tomorrow’s range of textures — Giardina added new materials like hemp linen and even cruelty-free silk. anothertomorrow.co",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/t-magazine/bard-edinburgh-home-goods-shop.html

He is really not a great guy. But my roommate is convinced the inmate has changed. She tells me details about their relationship, as friends do. It’s clear to me he hasn’t changed much.

Then she leads you to discover a panoply of tastes and techniques, including rectangular slab pies filled with fruit or cheese; folded yeast-raised plum pastries made with lard and butter; pear cake scented with sage; and pull-apart buns, like monkey bread. More familiar are Austrian and Hungarian items, including strudels, and some entries from the Jewish repertoire: “Jewish cookies with plum butter,” a.k.a. hamantaschen for Purim (starting on March 6), and perhaps the best noodle kugel you’re likely to try, a recipe from Transylvania crackling with phyllo. The histories of the many nationalities that inhabit the region and that have contributed to the table are outlined in rich detail. Shortcomings? She calls mostly for medium eggs but fails to say you can substitute large; and pan-sizes are often odd, so some adapting is necessary.
