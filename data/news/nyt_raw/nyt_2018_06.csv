Sackler, whose name is carved on the building’s exterior gray granite walls. Goldin and the group marched past an exhibition called “Encountering the Buddha” and positioned themselves along the atrium’s staircase and around a shallow fountain that sits at the bottom of the building. A lacquer wood sculpture called “Monkeys Grasping the Moon” by the Chinese artist Xu Bing dangled above, 72 feet long.

And then there was mine: “I did go through a period where I would covertly — but slavishly — read every book I could lay my hands on on how to be sexy/chic/mysterious/alluring like a French woman,” I wrote. It was, by far, the most embarrassing admission on the list.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-live-like-a-french-woman-books.html

The art world was still fairly small then, concentrated in just a few cities (London, Zurich and Paris among them), but its philosophical and commercial center was a cluster of storefronts in downtown Manhattan. In the years since, and especially in the last decade, the art world has transformed into a global monolith: there are now galleries with hundreds of employees and branches across several continents, businesses that have grown into international corporations overseeing the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year (and in some cases more). The industry is now an interconnected network of money and power that includes auction houses, where sales records are broken in a practiced routine that it is both mundane and exhausting, and art fairs, a pure distillation of capitalism in which galleries of all sizes pay large sums of money — thousands for a smaller gallery, usually tens of thousands for a larger one — to operate booths and peddle their wares to collectors (there are now more than 100 big ones all over the world). Art dealers are the entryway into this system, and many of those who began with mere ambitions to discover and financially support artists now must contend with the omnipresent threat of larger galleries, which scoop up those artists once they’ve become commercially successful.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/t-magazine/gallery-owners-paula-cooper-sean-kelly.html

She suggests the very front and center, but if you’ve been trained to look at the back of the hoop, continue to do so. You need to look at this spot for at least one full second before beginning your shot. Try not to shift your eyes for even a millisecond.

He sat before a wall of flat-screen monitors that beamed live, classified video feeds from drones hovering in distant war zones. On some days, Aaron discovered, little of interest appeared on the screens, either because a blanket of clouds obscured visibility or because what was visible — goats grazing on an Afghan hillside, for instance — was mundane, even serene. Other times, what unspooled before Aaron’s eyes was jarringly intimate: coffins being carried through the streets after drone strikes; a man squatting in a field to defecate after a meal (the excrement generated a heat signature that glowed on infrared); an imam speaking to a group of 15 young boys in the courtyard of his madrasa.

Simultaneously, it sinks into the rock at an imperceptibly slow rate. ",Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/science/giant-clam-acid.html

2018-06-14,Funky Ceramics Are Everywhere. Including in Galleries.,The fine art world has started to embrace works made from clay — a material it once deemed lowly.,"More than sewing, flower-arranging or zine-making, clay might offer the perfect antidote to modern times. Hyper-tactile, it taps into a primal desire to shape earth — what the potter and writer Edmund de Waal has described as thinking through the hands — and is beloved for its immediacy. “You move and the clay moves with you,” says Aneta Regel, who was a finalist for this year’s Loewe Craft Prize and who, 12 years after graduating from London’s Royal College of Arts, now finds her works — lumpy, funky, cooked until cracked — aligned with a prevailing taste for artfully imperfect handwork, more generally, and for all things ceramic, in particular. If it is unsurprising to find mounting evidence of the trend on Instagram and at lifestyle-leaning boutiques like Samuji in New York and CristaSeya in Paris, it is notable that clay’s proliferation has, over the past decade, extended to the fine art world, which has long been wary of the material, widely considered to be lowly, functional and inexpensive. One of de Waal’s early teachers liked to say that his pots “had to be cheap enough to drop,” a condition that recalls the train tracks around Kolkata, India, strewn with shards of terracotta as a result of riders’ tossing their empty cups of chai out the window.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/t-magazine/ceramics-art-gallery-ruby-neri.html

Where did these traditions come from, and how did they become so ingrained? And when did all that mythology come undone, sending classic rock from the cultural penthouse to the funeral parlor?” Below, Mr. Hyden talks about how the Who helped to inspire the book, the connection between music and mortality, and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/books/twilight-of-gods-classic-rock-steven-hyden-interview.html

Frank, plays on the soundtrack. “Wherever I have gone,” Frank sings, “the blues are all the same.” And this movie, written and directed by João Dumans and Affonso Uchôa, sees “the blues” as a universal language and condition.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/araby-review.html
2018-06-21,Review: This ‘Damsel’ Needs No Saving,Robert Pattinson discovers that Mia Wasikowska is not in distress in this entertainingly original western from the Zellner brothers.,"A counterfeit preacher, shoulders wreathed in dynamite and neck encircled by a makeshift noose, ponders his probable demise. As the camera crawls backward, we see a miniature horse standing calmly between his legs. The image — bizarrely comic and mildly menacing — occurs during the later stages of “Damsel,” but it handily encapsulates the tone of a movie that turns the classic western into something wackily eccentric and entertainingly original.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/movies/damsel-review-robert-pattinson-mia-wasikowska.html

2018-06-21,"Who Was Moe Berg? A Spy, a Big-League Catcher and an Enigma","Paul Rudd plays Berg in a new film. But for all his research, he could never get a clear picture of this World War II hero, intellectual and athlete.","Moe Berg played 15 mostly unremarkable seasons as a catcher in the majors for various teams, retiring in 1939 with a mediocre career batting average of .243 and a paltry six home runs. About his only notable accomplishment was an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games in the 1930s. This is hardly the stuff of big-screen biopics. But factor in his exploits in intelligence during World War II, and the draw becomes much clearer.

Marlina, a young widow living in remote Indonesia, spills blood in a story that plays out in four discrete acts. Each of the titled acts telegraphs some impending event (“The Robbery,” “The Birth”) and is clearly meant to create a mild sense of anticipation, much like the movie’s own explanatory title.

2018-06-24,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: A Fresh Look at Benedict Arnold’s Treason,"In “Turncoat,” the independent historian Stephen Brumwell argues that Arnold’s plot to foil the American Revolution was more complicated than it has previously appeared.","Benedict Arnold’s name might be the first that comes to mind when we think of treason not just because he was a traitor, but because he was such an unlikely one. For several years before he attempted to change the course of the American Revolution in 1780 by planning to help the British overtake West Point and capture George Washington, he had exhibited great courage and suffered serious injury for the colonies’ cause. “Within months of accepting command of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington had realized that Arnold was that prized rarity in an army of amateurs: a born soldier and charismatic leader of men,” Stephen Brumwell writes in his new book, “Turncoat: Benedict Arnold and the Crisis of American Liberty.” Arnold was a soldier after Washington’s “own heart, a tenacious fighter who refused to be discouraged by even the most unfavorable circumstances.” That Arnold betrayed his side is undoubted. But did he think of it that way? Below, Mr. Brumwell discusses how his book’s argument became much more original than he had expected, how history might have turned out differently and more.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/books/benedict-arnold-turncoat-stephen-brumwell-interview.html

2018-06-25,A Glimpse Into Parisian Dining Life,“Paris à Table” is a new translation of an 1846 book by the journalist Eugène Briffault.,"An eye-opening chronicle of French dining from 1846 has just been fully translated into English. The author, Eugène Briffault, was a journalist, gastronome, editor and critic who frequented the upper echelons of French society in the mid-19th century, a time of prosperity, indulgence and refinement. His book starts with dining habits in earlier eras and goes on to provide often acerbic commentary on the scene of his time, when Paris was considered to be the center of the culinary world. The book is filled with observations that still apply, like how the newly affluent display money but no taste, how female cooks are undervalued, how off-season vegetables please the eye but not the palate, and how tourism can be credited for the city’s cosmopolitan outlook. He suggests that “to be happy with the waiter, make sure the waiter is happy with you,” and notes that Parisians tossed their salads with about 500,000 gallons of vinegar a year. He covers the rich, the poor and even hospital food.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/dining/paris-a-table-1846-book.html

It was accompanied by a news bulletin announcing her retirement. The pithy text superimposed at the bottom of the photo elaborated: “Henceforth, my new racial designation will be neither black nor white but rather 6.25% grey, honoring my 1/16th African heritage,” she wrote. “Please join me in celebrating this exciting new adventure in pointless administrative precision and futile institutional control!” (Through extensive genealogical work, she later determined that her African heritage is closer to one-eighth.)",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/magazine/adrian-pipers-self-imposed-exile-from-america-and-from-race-itself.html

2018-06-28,Poem: American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin,Selected by Rita Dove.,"How fitting that in the month of American independence we come to celebrate the outgoing editor for this space. Terrance Hayes has, with more than a bit of shade, created his own brand of hip-hop sonnet. Just as the United States are multifarious and contradictory and complicated, he went on until he had accumulated an entire collection of sonnets, all bar none with the same title. Truly, a tour de force! “The song must be cultural, confessional, clear” — a pithy ars poetica for our volatile age. Hayes’s word plays, from homonyms to the transmogrification of Sturm und Drang into “storm and drum,” are less linguistic jokes than wry descriptions of an Anglo-America that has taken the historical discourse of Western civilization to its own brash level. And in case you were hoping to be let off easy, beware: The last line may stick in your throat.

For summer, he has turned to a warmer material: sand. Haulenbeek sculpts from a solid block of the silica-based variety — a byproduct of the casting process at the bronze foundry adjacent to his studio — before immersing the shape in tinted resin. One day, in the heat of creation, he seized on the perfect form through which to express the arid beauty of the technique: lamps that resemble flowering desert cacti, radiating light. $8,500, stevenhaulenbeek.com — NANCY HASS",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/t-magazine/zwirner-podcast-mary-macgill-store-editors-picks.html
