Published late last year, “The Korean Cookbook” by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.)

2024-01-09,"Coqodaq, From the Cote Team, Is a Temple of Fried Chicken","The Korean Chinese restaurant Octo opens in Koreatown, Bibliotheque brings a book-lined wine den to Mercer Street and more restaurant news.","Beef or chicken? The restaurateur Simon Kim now has you covered either way. An owner of the Korean steakhouse Cote is opening what he calls a “fried chicken cathedral,” with a dining room framed by glowing, barrel-vaulted arches that disappear to infinity, thanks to a rear wall mirror. The design is by the Rockwell Group, involving David Rockwell’s personal touch. But the food is Mr. Kim’s idea, more than four years in the making, with the executive chef Seung Kyu Kim in charge (no relation to the owner, though the two met while working at Jean-Georges). Simon Kim’s notion is to offer a mix of American and Korean approaches to fried chicken and give it glamour with (supposedly) more sustainable ingredients in a more elegant setting. At Coqodaq it’s one-size-fits-all, a $38 dinner that includes chicken soup; a bucket of chicken parts fried in a gluten-free batter based on rice flour, chicken glazed with gochujang or soy and garlic; a cold perilla noodle dish; banchan, small dishes, that include palate-cleansing white radish; and soft serve frozen yogurt. Starters (extra) include some seafood options. The chickens are pasture-raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, and triple-fried in oil produced in Iowa from fermented Brazilian sugar cane. The name of the restaurant blends French, American and Korean words for chicken. The sommelier, Victoria James, who also curates the wines at Cote, has a wine list that features Champagne, which she and Mr. Kim agree is the ideal beverage for fried chicken. Her list offers 400 of them, and other sparklers by the glass and the bottle. Considering that fried chicken is finger-food, in the front of the restaurant, there’s a hand-washing area with three sinks. Some high-top tables near the entrance are for walk-ins, there’s a long bar, and garage doors will open to an outside patio in warmer weather. Tables at the leather-upholstered booths beneath the arches in the 190-seat room have lazy susans, the better for sharing.

Once each kid stops freaking out about bringing home a talking lizard, Leo turns into a life coach/therapist for them.

But we ended up getting gifts anyway, and I treasured many of them: a ceramic plate painted with the mountains my friend loved so dearly; a tear-shaped nautical storm glass meant to divine the weather. These objects, incongruous and surprising, nothing we had chosen for ourselves, felt like ways our friends were co-signing on our new life together and stitching themselves into its daily weave. When we divorced, five years later in 2019, it felt — among other things — like a betrayal of those early vouches of faith. Standing in an empty kitchen in a bare apartment, tasked with building a new household from scratch, I started thinking, I wouldn’t mind a registry now.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/magazine/divorce-gift-registry.html

Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated him numerous times, after multiple arrests, in a windowless police-station room in the spring of 2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. “He said that was the best feeling he’d ever had, jumping on the train while it was moving,” Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force’s detectives, told me. “It was euphoric for him.” ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/magazine/train-robbery-amazon-packages.html

They established their first, August Gatherings, in Chinatown nearly 10 years ago with a Cantonese menu that had some creative twists. This time, they’re doubling down, adding additional global influences in a more formal setting and calling the food modern Cantonese. Mr. Leung, a native of Guangzhou who came to New York in 1988, pays homage with dishes like salt-baked chicken, several abalone preparations, fried rice with roasted eel, and Hong Kong style noodles with fish maw. But he will also be adding black truffles to his Cantonese shrimp dumplings, tossing octopus with fusilli, and using balsamic vinegar. Equipment like sous vide is also in his arsenal. “I’m preserving the integrity of Cantonese food but adding international ingredients and techniques,” he said. Among the desserts, he has successfully crossed the classic Chinese egg tart with the Portuguese nata, a similar confection that’s popular in Macau, and which he’s been serving at August Gatherings. Michael Goff, the beverage director, has assembled a tight list that starts at $50 but, with an eye on Wall Street, climbs to a $2,000 Burgundy. The restaurant’s fancy street entrance is next to the modest-looking Courtyard by Marriott, which houses the restaurant on its second floor. The large, airy, well-windowed space seating 168 in a main room and smaller private rooms, is fitted with banquettes and tables in quietly elegant tones of beige and salmon, with fake greenery and flowers and real Chinese ceramics.

2024-01-25,A Red Velvet Bistro in an Istanbul Villa,"Plus: jewelry handmade with Roman coins, vintage Estée Lauder fragrances and more recommendations from T Magazine.","During the 49 years that Estée Lauder worked at her namesake company, she oversaw the creation of a dozen scents and encouraged women to create fragrance “wardrobes” tailored to every occasion and mood. The brand’s Legacy Collection, which comes out on Feb. 1, revives five of Lauder’s creations with the help of Frédéric Malle (whose perfume brand was acquired by the Estée Lauder Companies in 2015) and the perfumers Anne Flipo, Carlos Benaïm and Bruno Jovanovic, all of whom have worked with Malle on previous fragrances. During an interview inside Lauder’s well-preserved office near Central Park, Malle explained how he retooled the scents using more modern fragrance-making techniques. He noted that, in Lauder’s day, perfumers combined base scents that were “like premixed mini-perfumes” to create a final fragrance. “They contained things that weren’t necessary and created background noise,” Malle said. To update the formulas, any nonessential ingredients in those bases were stripped away — “it’s like cleaning up,” he said. The new collection has notes that range from fresh and herbaceous to musky and sweet. Azurée, initially released in 1969, evokes dry Mediterranean shores with herby notes like basil and tarragon as well as jasmine, spicy cardamom, bergamot, and cumin, which Malle amplified in his edition. For White Linen, a classic floral bouquet of rose and jasmine, Malle used pure labdanum, an ambery resin from the rockrose plant, which wasn’t available when the scent debuted in 1978. Knowing, a seductive scent from 1988, “contained a little bit of the Muzak of the ’80s,” Malle said. The modernized version is a fruity chypre with raspberries, black currant, rose and patchouli. The overall goal of the collection, Malle said, “is to revive this work and show how good Mrs. Lauder was.” The Legacy Collection is available from Feb. 1, $280, esteelauder.com.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/t-magazine/istanbul-arkestra-restaurant-ritmo.html

A little over a year after recreational sales became legal in New Jersey, the chain opened a new location in a bland outdoor mall in Harrison, its aesthetic landing somewhere in the startup-meets-streetwear zone between Apple and Kith. I walked over to a large circular table laden with dozens of jars, each containing a different strain. There were longtime Cookies stalwarts like Gary Payton, a collaboration with the N.B.A. legend, and new variants with names like Mexican Flan and Dirty Muffler.
