Nearly a fourth of Americans claimed to have eaten less meat in 2019, according to a Gallup poll. The recipe site Epicurious, which reaches an audience of 10 million, phased out beef as an ingredient in new recipes in 2020. Diners at some McDonald’s can now sate their lust for a Quarter Pounder with a vegan McPlant instead. Faux meat products are projected to reach $85 billion in sales by 2030, according to a recent study by UBS, and Tyson Foods, one of the biggest beef packers in the United States, has hedged its bets by introducing its own plant-based line.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/t-magazine/meat-beef-vegetarianism-veganism.html

I’m fine — all the damage was to the unoccupied back end, thank goodness — but it’s put me into one of those strange middle-aged moods where the colors look brighter and life feels hallowed and precarious in exactly the way the great writers tell us it is; sometimes it takes the crunch of metal to drive that home, and sometimes it takes nothing more than words and characters and stories on a page. If you’re looking for the lesson without the adrenaline, you might pick up a new nonfiction book by Chris Lockhart and Daniel Mulilo Chama called “Walking the Bowl,” which follows a murder investigation among the street children of Lusaka, Zambia. That’s one of our recommendations this week.

The matching three-button jacket, cut high in the armholes — both broadening the shoulders and discouraging bad posture — should be fastened only once, snugly around the rib cage, from which the blazer should skim six inches over the pants’ waist.

The name refers to the former Del Posto and Daniel chef Melissa J. Rodriguez, who is partnering with Jeff Katz and James Kent of Crown Shy and Saga to develop this sprawling space. (Al Coro, a lavish Italian restaurant, and Discolo, a lower-level lounge, will open in the Del Posto space in early summer.) Mel’s is done warmly in orange tones and polished light wood, a bar and a dining counter open into a rear dining room, and a huge wood-fired pizza oven is central to the space. “Everything is cooked with wood,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “There’s no gas here.” The pizzas start with Margherita but quickly veer into creative territory: mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and shaved shallots; and kale, basil pesto, ricotta and preserved lemon. Many appetizers, like roasted parsnips with robiola cheese, roasted maitake mushrooms with soppressata piccante, and charred shrimp, are wood fired, as are mains like whole fish, whole roasted cauliflower and strip steak. Unlike at most pizzerias, dessert is neither an afterthought nor skippable. Consider milk chocolate gelato with dark chocolate sable swirl; salted caramel and fior di latte gelato with caramel sauce and shortbread crumble; or an Italian rainbow cookie hot fudge sundae, a tribute to Little Italy. The timing of the opening is calculated so that Ms. Rodriguez, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has several months to get Mel’s in order before Al Coro is unveiled.

Domestic scenes recur in much of his work: In brightly colored bronze and ceramic sculptures, he reimagines ordinary household objects — a remote control, faucets — as bulbous, biomorphic forms, some with eyes and ears. As if the result of a solo game of exquisite corpse, these composite creatures are oddly proportioned and at turns alluring and unsettling. Thus, Othello highlights the thrum of spirituality he finds in everyday environments.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/t-magazine/woody-de-othello-art.html

2022-03-17,8 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Disruption! Chaos! Pandemonium! It’s not much fun to live through, but in hindsight it can make for pretty good copy — so it’s not surprising to find, at the center of this week’s recommended titles, that the center doesn’t hold. NoViolet Bulawayo’s new novel, “Glory,” is all about political turmoil. Yoko Tawada’s latest, “Scattered All Over the Earth,” is about climate apocalypse. Two new biographies of Buster Keaton make the case that he was not only a comic genius but also a technological disrupter, madly innovating new directions for the film industry in its early days. And in “Origin,” Jennifer Raff sets out to overturn some long-held theories about the first humans to populate the Americas. Things fall apart. That’s the message of “The Quiet Before,” by Gal Beckerman (until recently my colleague at the Book Review), about social movements building from the ground up, and it’s the premise (in a very different way) of “The Old Woman With the Knife,” Gu Byeong-mo’s novel about a 65-year-old female assassin in Seoul. Meanwhile, disruption of another sort — aesthetic, existential — is at the core of the Swedish writer Jon Fosse’s seven-novel series “Septology,” about an aging painter arguing with God.

Here, hidden among pines overlooking the Silver Lake neighborhood’s reservoir, Nin envisioned a low, single-story aerie, which she called her “one large studio, no separate, small partitions.” This description appeared in the first edition of her diary (originally published in 1966), which she began writing at 11 as a child traveling to America from the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and continued until her death. Today, there are 18 volumes — with a final one left unpublished — comprising an oeuvre that also includes frank, feminist, sexually explicit, oft-censored essays about her various lovers; literary criticism (the English writer D.H. Lawrence was a favorite); and beloved works of fiction like “House of Incest” (1936) and “Delta of Venus” (1977), many of which she initially printed herself.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/t-magazine/anais-nin-los-angeles-home.html

Available for pre-order, it’s a timely memorial, tracing her life in California through the kitchens she experienced and ran. Notably, there’s the French Laundry, which she and her husband, Don, originally owned from 1978 to 1994, when Thomas Keller took over. The first kitchen in the book was her mother’s, the final one Elk Cottage, in Mendocino, Calif., where the Schmitts retired and she cooked for the two of them. The recipes woven throughout are almost book ended by the simplest from her mother: potatoes simmered then roasted to a crisp with a mustard slather; and sausages in hard cider, a two-ingredient marvel. The book, illustrated with photographs and memorabilia, is filled with often inventive but always ingredient-driven dishes, including many for duck. Some are written with step-by-step directions — two pages for a turkey sandwich! — that convey a sense that Ms. Schmitt is at your side offering handy tips. Her French Laundry recipes are pulled from daily five-course menus: warm salad of sweetbreads and mushrooms; roasted rib-eye of veal; and rhubarb mousse, nothing precious. Also described are the Vintage Café, the Chutney Kitchen and the Apple Farm, where teaching and catering mostly replaced nightly dinners.

Women and gay men and nonbinary people frequently remark on his appeal. While that appeal might have a daddy-issues vibe, it is also nostalgic for an old-school movie star masculinity that was problematic in its own time (the patriarchal colonialism!) and that has been now defanged in the #MeToo era.

Raised on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, a region with its own distinct traditions, “as remote from the mainland South as it was from the far-off North,” Richard Etheridge is also struggling with a deep sense of emotional isolation. Although he’s the son of an enslaved woman, he proudly bears the last name of the white father who owned him. A sergeant in the recently formed African Brigade, he owes his position less to his stature among his comrades than to the education imparted by his white half sister. “How much,” he’s forced to ask himself, “did I hate my own skin?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/books/review/black-cloud-rising-david-wright-falade.html

From the surf are raw bar selections, grilled octopus, poached prawns, bucatini with lobster, grilled tuna loin, and lobsters from a two-story tank to order grilled, wood-roasted or steamed.

He spent much of his weekends, however, a few miles northwest in Notting Hill, browsing at Portobello Market, which consists of a mile-long string of street vendors who have been congregating there since the late 1860s, and which, thanks to the so-called rag and bone men — essentially, cart-wielding junk dealers — has over the last eight decades evolved into an epicenter for antiques and eccentric bric-a-brac. Eventually, Karavil’s frequent excursions, as well as the neighborhood’s vibrant atmosphere, spurred him to look for a place in Notting Hill. First, he put an offer on a three-story London villa, but then he saw an apartment that spanned two floors of a stucco-fronted townhouse built in the mid-19th century. Though it needed considerable love, he knew, largely thanks to an original marble fireplace with neo-Classical corbel detailing and an unusual wrought-iron spiral staircase, that it was where he wanted to be.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/t-magazine/notting-hill-home-design.html

His colleagues noticed (“It was,” he conceded, “kind of ugly and noticeable”), but only a few of them knew it referred to a cause. The term was just getting mainstream traction — this was the year Al Gore released “An Inconvenient Truth” and Vanity Fair launched its first Green issue. But the science suggesting that industrial societies have thrown climatic rhythms wildly out of whack had been around for decades. Just a year earlier, the environmentalist Bill McKibben had railed against the culture’s perceived indifference. “Where are the books? The poems? The plays? The goddamn operas?” he wrote in an op-ed for Grist. “Compare it to, say, the horror of AIDS … which has produced a staggering outpouring of art that, in turn, has had real political effect.” For future generations looking back on the present, “the single most significant item will doubtless be the sudden spiking temperature.

Raised on Manhattan’s Upper East Side by an Austrian mother and a Hungarian father, she spent her childhood days wandering through museums and art galleries with her family. As a student at LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, Kosann would head downtown after class to rummage through antiques stores. At 16, the gift of a Rollei film camera from her father changed her life. Inspired by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, she spent the next two decades taking portraits of friends and acquaintances. Her love of old, beautiful things never faded, and she amassed in that time “about a gazillion” Art Deco cigarette cases, powder compacts, Victorian lockets and minaudières from the early 1900s, which she acquired at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen in Paris, along Portobello Road in London and down Vienna’s cobblestone side streets. Kosann would insert her photos into what she called “image cases,” and give them as presents to friends, and by 2003, she launched her namesake line of sterling silver photo boxes. She eventually expanded into jewelry, offering oval filigree lockets, enamel vermeil zodiac charms and stackable gold bands that riff on 15th-century poesy rings.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/t-magazine/monica-rich-kosann-necklace.html

2022-03-29,Why I Love Erotic Thrillers,They are best consumed as escapist fantasies about a mythic figure I myself could never embody: the femme fatale.,"I can trace my fascination with erotic thrillers back to the 1998 Neve Campbell and Denise Richards vehicle “Wild Things.” My father and I watched it together at his suggestion (there was never much censorship in my bohemian Manhattan childhood home), and as a burgeoning teen cinephile I was enchanted by its polished, artful sleaze. The plot concerns Campbell (brunette, surly, poor) and Richards (blonde, popular, wealthy), who accuse their high-school guidance counselor of abuse. Soon, the story becomes a thicket of convoluted double crosses, and nothing is what it originally seemed. By the time the end credits rolled and revealed Campbell as the film’s criminal mastermind, I was ready to cheer. Like many of the most captivating women in these films, Campbell’s character is an outsider who uses others’ underestimation of her abilities to her advantage. Fooled by her lower-class status, her enemies think she lacks savvy, but she is in fact a cunning strategist who uses her sexuality to outwit them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/magazine/erotic-thrillers-recommendation.html

They define it with the French term “bistronomie,” meaning a bistro for elegant dining. As for the restaurant’s name, it’s a sly reference to the Mitsu, meaning honey, in the chef’s name. (“Abeille” means “bee” in French.) Mr. Nagae’s menu includes pigeon glazed with miso and grilled over binchotan charcoal, lobster marinated with vanilla vinaigrette, and a dessert of strawberries with lychee, rose and shiso. There’s a six-course tasting menu, $180, in addition to à la carte. French bottles and especially Champagnes dominate the wine list, which is curated by John Mckenna, the beverage director.
