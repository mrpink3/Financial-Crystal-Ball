2014-12-01,‘Zhivago’ Musical Casting Announced,"Tam Mutu will get a second chance to make his Broadway debut in a leading role, this time as the title character in the musical “Doctor Zhivago.”","Tam Mutu will get a second chance to make his Broadway debut in a leading role, this time as the title character in the musical “Doctor Zhivago,” the show’s producers planned to announce on Monday. Kelli Barrett (“Baby It’s You,” “Wicked”), is to star opposite Mr. Mutu as Zhivago’s paramour, Lara Guishar, in the production based on Boris Pasternak’s 1957 novel about romance and revolution in Russia during World War I. While Mr. Mutu is a familiar presence in the West End of London, including a recent role as Javert in “Les Misérables” at Queen’s Theater and a coming starring role as Stone in the Donmar Warehouse production of “City of Angels,” his original Broadway debut was to have been “Rebecca,” which was undermined by financial shortcomings and scandal. Other key players in “Doctor Zhivago” will include the Tony-nominated Tom Hewitt (“The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” “Jesus Christ Superstar”) as the aristocrat Viktor Komarovsky, and Paul Nolan, (who is currently playing Guy in “Once”) as the revolutionary Pasha Antipov. Full casting is to be announced later. The musical version of “Doctor Zhivago” (with book by Michael Weller, music by Lucy Simon, and lyrics by Michael Korie and Amy Powers) had its world debut in 2006 at La Jolla Playhouse in California. In 2011, it was revised at the Lyric Theater in Sydney. Des McAnuff (“Jersey Boys,” “The Who’s Tommy”) will direct.

Mark Ruffalo stars as Ned, a stand-in for Mr. Kramer, who notices that a mysterious disease is starting to claim lives in New York and pleads for his fellow gay men to change their sexual behavior — and for the political establishment to heed the crisis. Matt Bomer (above left, with Mr. Ruffalo) plays Felix, Ned’s lover, a reporter at The New York Times. And Julia Roberts is Dr. Emma Brookner, who takes notice of the terror and tries to fight on behalf of her patients.

2014-12-04,Our Police Problem,Eric Garner’s death and the balance between liberty and order.,"On Tuesday, I wrote about my worry that the way the Ferguson story had turned out, with a widening gap between the activist narrative and the seeming facts, might end up setting back the possibilities for right-left consensus on criminal justice reform. Yesterday, as if in some malign answer to that concern, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict, on any charge, the policeman whose chokehold — caught on video — on an unarmed man being detained on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes led to his asphyxiation, cardiac arrest and death. And in this case, unlike the non-indictment of the Ferguson cop, the shocked/troubled response to the non-indictment has spanned the partisan divide. (For a range of views from people in various ways on the “right,” I recommend reading Sean Davis, Russell Moore, Pete Wehner, John Podhoretz, Rod Dreher, Glenn Beck, Peter Suderman, and even the not-exactly-a-civil-libertarian Andrew McCarthy.)",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/our-police-problem/

2014-12-05,What’s on TV Friday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (2014) With New York held hostage by Oscorp, it’s up to Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a.k.a. Spider-Man, to come to the rescue of the city he vowed to protect in this second installment in Mark Webb’s franchise, based on the Marvel comic. Emma Stone returns as Peter’s love interest, Gwen Stacy; Jamie Foxx is Electro, the latest disgruntled employee turned monster; Dane DeHaan is Harry Osborn, Peter’s frenemy; and Sally Field is Aunt May. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that this sequel, “until a late, lamentably foolish turn, balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears.” Mr. Garfield, “who’s making a career out of playing delicate flowers, fits the role, suit and moist sniffling fine,” she added. But “Mr. Webb seems to have been hired mostly to keep Sony’s Spider machine going, a tricky task, given that the character doesn’t have the mythic grandeur and gravity that make Batman and Superman seem endlessly exploitable,” she added, comparing Spider-Man to Hamlet. It “goes without saying that while some superheroes are born great, others need to have greatness thrust upon them.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

2014-12-05,"‘Fragrant,’ by Mandy Aftel",An artisan perfumer urges us to “regain an authentic connection to the sense of smell.”,"Why do we like our chewing gum to taste of mint? The herb grows abundantly on nearly all continents and has long been used as a curative for a variety of conditions. The Japanese once considered mint an effective form of birth control. In the Trobriand Islands, it served as a love charm. The ancient Greeks thought it could end hiccups. And the Romans believed a crown of fresh mint placed atop one’s head would serve to stimulate the mind. In several cultures, mint was recommended as an aid to calm upset stomachs, a practice that explains the longstanding tradition of serving after-dinner mints. But perhaps the crisp, bright smell of mint and the cooling sensation of menthol in the mouth are what make it so refreshing to the palate. When, in the 1890s, William Wrigley Jr. added chewing gum to his line of soaps and baking powder, he tried the brilliant idea of mixing spearmint and peppermint oils with the chicle he was importing from Latin America. Soon his gum was a hit — and a minty-fresh flavor industry was born. ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/fragrant-by-mandy-aftel.html

2014-12-05,Humor,"New books by Bob Odenkirk, Mallory Ortberg and others.","Most art doesn’t command attention past a generation or two, because most art isn’t very good. Nonetheless, it sometimes feels as if comedy in any guise — written, visual, staged, filmed — is the most evanescent art form of all, especially given the binary response it provokes, either amusing you or not. A book or painting or drama that no longer speaks to us can be shrugged off, but an unfunny joke grates — comedy might be dismissed by some as a lower art form, but in a weird way we hold it to a higher standard. Thus comic strips or stand-up routines that made Grandma and Grandpa laugh can strike the present day as not just dated but downright embarrassing or even, depending on the butt of a joke, shameful; whatever wit an old laugh line possessed can curdle across decades to the point that its rank mirthlessness becomes a kind of KICK ME sign taped to the past’s back.

(His latest, “The Slow Regard of Silent Things,” spent a month on the hardcover fiction list before falling, this week, to No. 20 on the extended list.) Rothfuss is also the driving force behind a charity called Worldbuilders, which uses auctions, giveaways and “good old-fashioned ballyhoo,” as he put it in a recent phone conversation, to benefit the anti­poverty organization Heifer International. ­Ballyhoo? “Cool people doing weird things,” Rothfuss explained. For instance, when donations to the current fund drive reached $150,000, Worldbuilders posted a video of the author Myke Cole reviewing “Hedging His Bets,” a work of ­were-hedgehog erotica. (“It’s nice to know that, at least in the world of sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-genre literature, we’re forging into bold new territory,” Cole said.)

These Scotch-Irish immigrants moved principally to Appalachia, where their traditions took new forms in classics like “Barbara Allen” and “Shady Grove.” As Dolly Parton writes in her introduction, “I grew up in the Smoky Mountains listening to these ancient ballads that had crossed oceans and valleys,” songs that became the basis for folk, bluegrass and country music.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/wayfaring-strangers-and-ralph-peer-and-the-making-of-popular-roots-music.html
2014-12-05,‘The Image of the Black in Western Art’,Claudia Rankine reviews the latest and perhaps last volume in Dominique de Menil’s monumental archival project.,"Dominique de Menil’s monumental archival project of collecting and documenting the “image of the black in Western art” began in the 1960s as an aesthetic form of resistance to anti-black racism at the height of the civil rights movement. But with the publication of the fifth volume, concentrating on the 20th century, it has become a necessary cultural resource documenting the visual construction of blackness over the past 5,000 years. This latest and perhaps last volume — subdivided into two parts, “The Impact of Africa” and “The Rise of Black Artists” — redirects the underlying colonialist, Eurocentric framing of the previous four volumes. The co-editors, David Bindman and Henry Louis Gates Jr., bring focus to black artists globally as makers of their own art and imagery, rather than solely the subjects of others’ fantasies and fascination. Though some attention is paid to overtly racist imagery popular in the first half of the 20th century, the books as a pair stand in line with de Menil’s original, corrective intent to assert presence. Given the volumes’ title and the original terms of de Menil’s archival project, a reader could not be faulted for anticipating a salon installation of numerous images — but in fact, brilliant essays by the likes of Deborah Willis, Christian Weikop, Petrine Archer and many other noted scholars richly motivate this endeavor.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/the-image-of-the-black-in-western-art.html

Her work came to general attention only when, in 2007, two years before her death, five storage lockers on which she had failed to keep up payments were emptied and their contents auctioned off. By the time the buyers realized what they had on their hands, she had died. John Maloof, who bought most of it, put up a selection of scans on a website, which immediately went viral; Maier posthumously became a media sensation. Maloof’s VIVIAN MAIER: A Photographer Found (Harper ­Design, $80), with text by Marvin Heiferman, is already the fifth book of her photographs to have been published.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/vivian-maier-a-photographer-found-and-more.html

By the time he retired from the National Hockey League in 1980, at age 52, he had sustained at least 14 broken noses and, by his estimation, required more than 300 stitches to repair his face.

2014-12-05,"‘Wagstaff: Before and After Mapplethorpe,’ by Philip Gefter",A biography of the photographer Sam Wagstaff.,"The mention of Sam Wagstaff’s name is likely to elicit a respectful nod from anyone who cares about photography. He made his mark in the ’70s, when he haunted print shops and auction houses and assembled a major collection. Eccentric and wide-ranging, his holdings mingled classic images from the 19th century — misty views of French forests, soulful portraits of poets — with contemporary images of brazen eroticism. Was photography art? Wagstaff’s lover, Robert Mapplethorpe, answered the question with a vengeance, yoking an austere, nearly arctic elegance to images of flowers, male nudes and the rituals of sadomasochism.

Outside, the inevitable California afternoon blazes with cruel banality; inside, it’s 2 a.m. forever. An ear rings, a synapse misfires. Your rock star ­begins to ramble. How true will you be to the tone of his talk, to his fractured anecdotal style with the woozy ­silences and the skeletal chuckles? Will you fix his grammar, trim his profanities, check his facts?

In the past two decades, she has starred in at least 20 new biographies, six museum exhibitions and six novels. Three editions of her correspondence have also appeared during this time, as have many more studies (of Napoleon and other Bonapartes) in which she features. The latest addition to this corpus is “Ambition and Desire: The Dangerous Life of Josephine Bonaparte,” by Kate Williams, a biographer of Queen Victoria and Emma Hamilton. Beyond her appreciation for “flawed, vulnerable, engaging, powerful” women, Williams does not seem to have a compelling reason to tell this story. In the absence of new material or a new approach, she offers a breathless paean to the woman who, while “no great beauty,” could with “one twitch of her skirt . . . enthrall the man who terrorized Europe.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/ambition-and-desire-the-dangerous-life-of-josephine-bonaparte-by-kate-williams.html

But not in an entirely bad way. It helps that Poehler is upfront about her exhaustion, given that she is a 43-year-old sitcom star who shoots 12 hours of television a day while mothering two children under 7. Even when Poehler does sleep, she wakes herself up 20 to 30 times a night (according to a Beverly Hills sleep clinic) and, apparently, snores “like a dragon.” She freely allows that “Yes Please” is a “spontaneous overflow in the middle of chaos, not tranquillity,” a thing written on subways and planes, “ugly and in pieces.” And in the end, no apologies. She finished the job. Perfection is a luxury. As improv’s godfather Del Close used to say: “Don’t think.” “Get out of your head,” Poehler writes. “Stop planning and just go.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/books/review/yes-please-by-amy-poehler.html

Geekdom was born under the moon of the modern Hollywood blockbuster era and nurtured by the simultaneous development of home computers and cable television — which in turn begat the Internet, TCM, Fandango and trivia-enhanced moviegoing life as we know it.

At the time, the 27-year-old Irish upstart had yet to write any of the works that would earn his fame. Undercredentialed as Wilde then was, his verbal verve and outlandish dress (satin breeches, velvet jackets, black cape) had made him a sought-after dinner guest in London and prompted a 10-month American tour, where his brio met with an ecstatic reception. “It was a superb performance, a masterpiece of sparkling wit and gaiety,” wrote one audience member in an account of the event. “Never before, or since, have I heard anything that compared to it.” Who was Wilde’s lucky interlocutor?

However, there are a number of works on view in the week’s namesake fair — which is open until Sunday at the Miami Beach Convention Center — that simultaneously reify the glamour industry and parody it, co-opting the language of glossy magazines to present fashion portraits as art. At Berlin’s Société gallery in Art Basel’s Nova section (dedicated to “new” galleries), Timur Si-Qin’s light box of three sinewy youths in a bright, bucolic setting catches the lens in precisely the style of an Abercrombie & Fitch ad. The shot is blown up from Si-Qin’s artist book, which resembles a complete A&F catalog, replacing the iconic initials with his own yin-yang “peace” logo. Reena Spaulings Fine Art from New York has a number of works on view by the feminist provocateur K8 Hardy, including a large-scale reproduction of her underground zine from the early aughts, “Fashion Fashion,” inflecting the language of the women’s magazine with a post-riot-grrrl conceptual wit. Another Berlin gallery, Contemporary Fine Arts, is showing the largest cover among the three as a central feature of its booth. Not even for sale (or so the gallery says), Juergen Teller’s shot of Stella Tennant in men’s briefs, a hooded robe and trainers is intended to draw attention to the booth as much as to contribute to its context — a harmony heard loud and clear all around town.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/art-basel-miami-where-art-imitates-fashion/

In our cover story, the 11-year-old actress Quvenzhané Wallis, star of the new “Annie” remake, takes us roller skating and proves that, sometimes, the best things do come in small packages. In London, Jody Rosen follows a man through “The Knowledge,” the grueling — and, some might say, anachronistic — years-long qualification process to become one of the city’s cab drivers. In a sunnier locale, we explore the all-night debauchery of Ibiza, where an influx of billionaires and celebrity influencers is bent on reinventing the island’s image (if not tamping down its fun). And in a 19th-century castle in rural Ireland, we pay a visit to the controversial, duck-obsessed artist Gottfried Helnwein, whose tight-knit clan and macabre digs call to mind a real-life Addams Family. Elsewhere, Andrew O’Hagan pours one out for sobriety, with mixed results; a lifelong devotee of the Vermont Country Store waxes nostalgic on its down-home charms; Hollywood’s hottest stars make a break for Broadway; and in the spirit of the season, we share a compendium of covetable gifts made by under-the-radar artisans from around the world.

(CUNY) WELCOME (2010) City Cinematheque’s latest series, “Exploring Human Rights in 21st-Century World Cinema,” continues with Philippe Lioret’s tale about Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), a 17-year-old Kurdish refugee on a quest to reunite with his girlfriend (Derya Ayverdi, Mr. Ayverdi’s sister) in Britain before her father can marry her off to another. But after being stopped by the authorities in Calais, on the French side of the Channel, he decides to swim for it. Vincent Lindon plays Simon, the public-pool instructor in the midst of a divorce who helps Bilal — and who ultimately decides that he, too, will do whatever it takes to reach happiness. “Like few other films about illegal immigration and its perils, ‘Welcome’ puts you so completely into the shoes of a young man facing almost insurmountable obstacles that you feel a profound empathy not only for him but also for all who are ready to risk everything for the dream of a better life,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Ayverdi’s portrayal of a shy innocent driven by blind faith in himself and ferocious stamina finds exactly the right spirit of determination tinged with petulance to make him entirely believable.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

Never!” The Emperor, while conversing generally and freely, refused to touch upon any subject concerning the political situation. He said they had a very good voyage, with beautiful weather, but his lips were sealed upon political topics.

But most just keep going: looking at the passing world, drifting in and out of the strange kind of contemplation travel can induce, until they’ve reached their destination.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/books/review/family-furnishings-selected-stories-by-alice-munro.html

This year, however, because PEN asked me to annotate the book, I did read it all the way through, and I was glad I did, because when I got to that final sentence, I suddenly remembered something I had long since forgotten: The moment when I thought of that sentence — and how much that moment meant to me.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/books/review/the-power-broker-40-years-later.html

2014-12-12,What’s on TV Friday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (Starz) TRUST ME (2014) Clark Gregg (“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) wrote, directed and stars in this black comedy about Hollywood wheeling and dealing, centered on Howard Holloway, a floundering agent specializing in child actors. He should know: Howard used to be one himself, until his career sank 36 years earlier with a Jan-Michael Vincent surf movie that was never made. But a chance meeting with a wildly talented 13-year-old from Oklahoma (Saxon Sharbino) with a controlling, alcoholic father (Paul Sparks) might be his road to redemption. Felicity Huffman plays the producer of a new vampire franchise, and Allison Janney is her casting director, both of whom loathe Howard; Sam Rockwell is his client-poaching archrival. “The performances and some of the writing are the movie’s strongest elements,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Sharbino “has the radiance and skills to be a teenage megastar in a ‘Twilight'-like series.” He said Mr. Gregg “succeeds in finding some humanity inside a dislikable creep.” But “as the movie picks up speed and undergoes sudden, confusing plot reversals, it loses its satirical edge,” he added. “You can’t help wondering if the production ran out of money while racing to meet a deadline.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html

But after last year’s harsh winter, Ballet Theater has had enough. Or perhaps after five years, it has been unable to find a real toehold in this city’s crowded Nutcracker marketplace.

It’s been decades since the last major museum show devoted to it, but even a quick tour of “Fiber: Sculpture 1960-Present” at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, tells us what we’ve been missing.

A suspended three-dimensional sculpture of knotted sisal by the Croatian artist Jagoda Buic is as big as a ballroom chandelier. A new work by the great Sheila Hicks pours down, a Niagara of silk and linen cords, from the ceiling. Some of the quietest things are the most beautiful, like Lenore Tawney’s revolutionary open-weave “Dark River” from 1961.

The next morning, while a group of friars and art experts was surveying the damage, another tremor struck, burying the upper level of the church in debris. And not just any debris. Scattered among the ruins of the vault, shrouded in clouds of dust and crumbled brick, were frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue that had stood since the late 13th century. Four people died, and so did any hope for a complete restoration.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/books/review/the-basilica-of-st-francis-in-assisi.html

2014-12-12,Inside the List,"“The Beatles ­Lyrics,” No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, includes handwritten drafts, including crossouts and false starts.","Yeah Yeah Yeah: Shortly before it imploded earlier this month, the venerable old magazine — sorry, “vertically integrated digital media company” — The New Republic observed its centennial with a list of the 20th century’s leading thinkers across a range of disciplines: the top philosopher, the top economist, the top diplomat and so on. John Lennon and Paul McCartney did not win in the songwriting category; that honor went to Bob Dylan instead. But they were among the runners-up, and in its citation to explain why, the new New Republic made the kind of gaffe the old New Republic would probably have avoided: Two of the three Beatles songs it alluded to weren’t written by Lennon or McCartney. (“There was something in the way they came together,” the citation read, “the way they moved, the way they twisted and shouted.” But George Harrison wrote “Something,” while “Twist and Shout” isn’t a Beatles original at all; it was written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns. The one song the magazine got right, more or less, was “Come Together.”) The Beatles fare better in a new book by their longtime Boswell, Hunter Davies, whose collection “The Beatles ­Lyrics” enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 15. In gathering as many handwritten drafts as he could, including crossouts and false starts, Davies traces the evolution of some of rock ‘n’ roll’s most enduring songs. “The further we get from them,” he writes of the Beatles in his introduction, “the bigger they become.” Davies’s book has been greeted with almost religious devotion in some quarters. “When the lyrics, like those for ‘The Word’ and ‘Baby You’re a Rich Man,’ include multi­colored doodlings by a presumably stoned author,” Andy Gill wrote in the British newspaper The Independent recently, “they’re like the primitivist equivalent of illuminated manuscripts.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html

A. N. Wilson’s addition to this library, “Victoria: A Life,” is a story of success against what looked at first like overwhelming odds. His Cinderella-like heroine grew up fatherless, a poor relation surrounded by warring court factions. Still a teenager when the death of successive relatives left her to inherit her uncle’s throne, Victoria was faced with a series of fragile coalition governments, labor unrest at home, a famine in Ireland, revolutions on the other side of the Channel, a spectacularly mismanaged war in the Crimea — and that’s just in the first two decades.

Consider the fate of the nail-salon tycoon, Mr. Ng, who flipped his Mercedes, which promptly burst into flames, or the ex-Marine Duncan Parker, who was planning to lose his ­Amazon-size wife but by the time the last bullet was fired ended up losing himself. Then, of course, there are the perfectly “normal” deaths brought about by bad hearts and other medical conditions, the kind that were responsible for the collapse of the neighbor found in his car “with the door open and one foot out on the concrete of the garage floor,” with “no signs of violence of any kind.” But it’s not easy distinguishing a normal death from an abnormal one in Forgetful Bay, where only one thing is ever certain — if you’re looking to move in, several of the nicer units should be available real soon.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/books/review/there-must-be-some-mistake-by-frederick-barthelme.html

Such literature sets out to refocus your daily life with your child, usually with proscriptive rebukes and optimistic exercises — with easy-sounding answers that are often impossible to enact. Anyone who has raised a child will know how assaultive the abundance of such parenting advice can feel, how dreary it is to be told constantly that if you only did (or, indeed, had done) something slightly different, your child’s problems would evanesce, and you would have, through the alchemy of nurture, a child who is happy / well behaved / nonviolent / good at math / successful / self-­motivated / popular / thin.

2014-12-13,Sudan: Prosecutor Halts Darfur Inquiry,The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Friday that she was suspending investigations in Darfur because no arrests had been made in a decade and the United Nations Security Council had been unwilling to use its powers to help.," The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Friday that she was suspending investigations in Darfur because no arrests had been made in a decade and the United Nations Security Council had been unwilling to use its powers to help. The prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, left, said that given her limited resources and the lack of political will, she had no other choice, even as the decade-long violence in Darfur, in western Sudan, was worsening and government-run militias had stepped up attacks against civilians, especially women. Ms. Bensouda called for a “dramatic shift” in the Council’s approach and for “concrete solutions” to get arrests. In 2005, the Security Council asked the court to open a criminal investigation of Sudan’s campaign against civilians and rebel groups in Darfur. As a result, the court indicted President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, his defense minister and two other associates on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. But when the officials traveled abroad, other countries refused to arrest them. The court has no police force of its own, and the prosecutor’s complaints to the Council were ignored, she said. “We find ourselves in a stalemate that can only embolden perpetrators,” Ms. Bensouda said. The indictments, however, will remain in place. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/world/africa/sudan-prosecutor-halts-darfur-inquiry.html

Jackson, an influential hedge-fund manager, had become fixated on Yahoo and the efforts of its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, to turn around the enormous yet floundering Internet company. It was July 21, 2014, almost exactly two years to the day since Mayer took over, arriving at Yahoo’s headquarters to an unfurled purple carpet and Shepard Fairey-style “HOPE” posters bearing her face. During those 24 months, Mayer eliminated dozens of products and rebooted others. She acquired 41 start-ups and even hired Katie Couric. But just one week earlier, Mayer announced the company’s lowest quarterly earnings in a decade. Jackson argued in his post that Yahoo no longer made sense as an independent entity. Instead, it might be a nice takeover target for one of the tech industry’s Big Four: Apple, Facebook, Amazon or Google.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/magazine/what-happened-when-marissa-mayer-tried-to-be-steve-jobs.html

He lunched in cafeterias with the kibbutzniks he idolized, ate frozen treats on the beach and climbed a lookout tower, peering into Jerusalem’s still forbidden Old City. A year later, Zemel was ecstatic when Israeli forces captured everything he had surveyed and beyond, including the Temple Mount, the West Bank and Gaza, in the Six-Day War with Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Over the decades, as Israel matured and began to wrestle with the occupation, Zemel did, too. He visited Israel again and again, as a college student, a rabbinical student and an assistant rabbi in Minnesota.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/magazine/can-liberal-zionists-count-on-hillary-clinton.html

The gritty, unsparing stories in this debut collection give us a visceral feel for what it was like to be a soldier on the ground in Iraq and what it was like to return home to a country that was mostly oblivious to the fact that America was even at war. A veteran of the Marine Corps, who served in Iraq during the surge, Mr. Klay writes with enormous precision and depth of feeling, the exactitude of his prose containing, and at the same time underscoring, war’s violence and chaos. His 12 stories are told in the first person, but from a variety of points of view (a young artilleryman, a member of Mortuary Affairs, a veteran attending law school). Together, these tales create a choral portrait of the war, and they testify to Mr. Klay’s range as a writer and his understanding of its human costs.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/books/phil-klays-redeployment-gary-shteyngarts-memoir-and-more.html

During Soviet rule, Tchkonia says, “Georgian women always looked different, even during that hard period when everything was forbidden. My mother told me that their inspiration was movies, especially French and Italian.” These days, Georgian designers are coming into their own with a new sense of creative – and infrastructural – autonomy. And while Georgia’s notable wine culture and the local taste for elegance might lend the impression that Georgia is the Italy of Eurasia, the capital’s experimentalism feels more like Antwerp’s.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/tbilisi-georgia-fashion-scene-emerges/

Her marriage to her songwriting collaborator André Previn certified her as a member of the Hollywood establishment, not the Laurel Canyon circle.

If you lived in Southern California in the 1990s, as I did, and paid any attention to newspaper journalism, you quickly learned to seek out Tobar’s byline in The Los Angeles Times. Whether reporting on murder trials or lottery winners, Tobar had an eye for humanizing details: the wife in the back of the courtroom reading a book about her husband’s case, say, or the small African-­American barbershop persevering as its neighborhood became increasingly Latino. Those were glory days at the newspaper; Tobar sometimes shared a byline with a young crime reporter named Michael Connelly. But in September, Tobar — the son of Guatemalan immigrants, whose father used to deliver The Times — announced he was leaving after more than 20 years to teach at the University of Oregon. He does plan to keep writing books. (“Deep Down Dark” is his fourth, after a couple of novels and “Translation Nation,” a look at Spanish-speaking communities across America.) “For the first time in my life,” he explained on Facebook, “I gave myself permission to think of myself as an artist — not an easy thing for me or any other son of immigrants to do.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/inside-the-list.html

Instead, a more natural locus for that encounter was found in the study of the mind.

Putting on men’s clothing and winning over everyone by force of character and belief, she gets her army and triumphantly achieves all that the voices have foretold. Pious, outspoken, stubborn and recklessly courageous, she breaks every rule of gender, class and organized religion, and the people flock to her. Then comes her fall. Sidelined at court, she waits too long to launch an unsuccessful attack on English-occupied Paris, during which she is wounded, and then in a skirmish at Compiègne she is captured. Abandoned by the king, she is cruelly imprisoned, tried as a heretic and witch, then burned at the stake.

In one county community, for example, public interest lawyers found that 100 percent of all the searches and arrests that originated from traffic stops in 2013 were of African Americans.",Opinion,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/missouri-a-g-sues-over-issue-at-heart-of-ferguson-riots/

2014-12-19,A River of Money Thanks to Jackman,"The new Hugh Jackman play on Broadway, “The River,” has recouped its $3.2 million capitalization.","The new Hugh Jackman play on Broadway, “The River,” has recouped its $3.2 million capitalization in just seven weeks, the show’s producers said on Friday. It is a remarkably fast achievement, aided by the show’s unusual ticketing policy. While “The River” is offering dozens of seats at the relatively low prices of $35 and $95 at every performance, the producers are reaping profits by selling many more tickets for more than $275. The show’s average ticket price last week was $154.37, one of the highest on Broadway. While the reviews were mixed for “The River,” a dark tale of a man who brings his girlfriend to a fishing cabin, the box-office power of Mr. Jackman (above) — a Tony winner as well as a movie action hero — is potent enough to reliably sell out performances. Written by Jez Butterworth (“Jerusalem”) and directed by Ian Rickson, “The River” is at the Circle in the Square Theater until Feb. 8.",Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/theater/a-river-of-money-thanks-to-jackman.html

2014-12-21,1914: France Silences Enemy Guns Near Arras,"From the International Herald Tribune archives: After intense German shelling near Arras in 1914, the French fight back.","LONDON — Arras is once more the centre of severe fighting, and that fine city of the north of France, so many of whose artistic or historic monuments are already in ruins, has received further punishment from the pitiless German shells. Having already destroyed the belfry of the famous church, the Germans are now probably bent on leaving not one stone of it upon another. But although the army of “Kultur” may destroy the beauties of helpless French cities, it is having no success when opposing itself to the French troops. In front of Arras the French artillery threw such a rain of shells into the enemy’s lines that no fewer than thirty-six cannon were silenced. Immediately after the infantry advanced, and after a hand-to-hand fight gained several trenches. The cavalry also took a distinguished part, the cuirassiers nailing the German artillerymen at their guns. Not satisfied with working further havoc in Arras, the Germans have also had recourse to another one of their favorite diversions, and have bombarded the hospital in Ypres. Such tactics on the part of the Germans generally indicate that they can make no headway in legitimate fighting. This view is, in fact, frankly expressed by a war correspondent of the “Berliner Tageblatt.” — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 22, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/1914-france-silences-enemy-guns-near-arras/

(Showtime 2) LEE DANIELS’ THE BUTLER (2013) Inspired by the real story of Eugene Allen, Mr. Daniels follows a White House butler, Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), and his wife, Gloria (Oprah Winfrey), as history — particularly the civil rights movement — unfolds over seven presidential administrations. A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called the film “a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial.” Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecil’s close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. “In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf,” Mr. Scott wrote. “ 'The Butler’ has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at each’s point of view.” He added: “We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/arts/television/whats-on-tv-sunday.html

Today’s two votes made the current presidential election the longest in the 18-year-old history of the Italian Republic. The previous record was the nine ballots it took in 1962 to elect Antonio Segni president. Mr. Segni resigned earlier this month after it became clear that he would not be able to perform the functions of the office as a result of a stroke he suffered in August. The voting today was also marked by the appearance, for the first time on the ballot, of Deputy Premier Pietro Nenni’s name. Mr. Nenni, long an outsider in government affairs, is leader of the left-wing Socialists. He joined the government of Premier Aldo Moro last year in its “opening to the left.” Former Premier Giovanni Leone, the official Christian Democrat candidate, polled 299 votes tonight — six less than in the ninth ballot this morning. A total of 482 votes are needed for election. The Social Democrats and Republicans, as well as the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement, abstained in tonight’s vote. Legislators nearly came to blows in the morning session when Communists and Fascists jeered and shouted at each other. It was the first such outbreak since balloting began Dec. 16. Parliament meets again tomorrow morning for the 11th ballot. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Dec. 22, 1964",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/1964-tempers-flare-as-italian-parliament-fails-to-elect-new-president/

Ms. Hawkins’s portrayal is “glorious,” a “gurgling, burbling stream of gasps, giggles and words,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critic’s pick. “Mr. Leigh has a documentarian’s eye for unadorned reality — his people and places look equally lived in — and his dialogue has the ebb and flow, the swells and eddies and logjams of ordinary conversation,” she added. “But the dramatist in Mr. Leigh is always hard at work, aligning his characters for maximum narrative effect and emotional pow.

No matter how much one tries, as The Times does, to include poets among the various biographers, essayists, novelists and so forth, it’s hard not to feel that poetry is fundamentally different from prose of any stripe.

So here are 10 American poetry collections published in 2014 that I would recommend not only to poetry veterans, but to readers coming to the form with limited experience. In keeping with Times policy, this list includes no friends, lovers, babysitters or college roommates.

2014-12-24,What’s on TV Wednesday,Television highlights.,"8:45 A.M. (HBO2) ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) Beneath glum, gray skies in suburban New York, deeply wounded adults find each other, love each other and take extraordinary medical measures to forget each other. Joel (Jim Carrey) is a man as dull and listless as the weather, and Clem (Kate Winslet, exuding wounded charm) is a brilliant and scatterbrained young woman who briefly makes his existence pop. They may have known each other once before; the script, written by Charlie Kaufman, reveals the truth of the on-screen relationships slowly and with obvious glee. Clem and Joel and who-knows-how-many of the other characters have turned to a process developed by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to burn away their most hurtful memories of each other. Much of the film’s second half is set within Joel’s mind, as he witnesses his memories’ destruction in real time. “This entire section is breathtakingly realized,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, “melting several bad dreams into one.” Michel Gondry’s “swift, improvised direction bleaches the portentousness from the conception.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday.html

Leo Tolstoy is describing Anna ascribing an emotion to a man whose love she needs so desperately that she is convinced he has stopped loving her. Consider also this: When she lifted her coffee cup, she extended her pinkie away from it — a precious gesture that signals just how far this domesticated, miserable Anna has come from the glamorous young woman she was at the beginning of the novel; she made a sound with her lips — and she realized this when she lifted her gaze and saw Vronsky looking at her.

2014-12-25,1914: Christmas at the Front,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Celebrating Christmas at the front with cigars and plum pudding in 1914.,"LONDON — Though there will be no Christmas truce on the fighting line, the day will not be forgotten. Among the British soldiers in particular, to whom the fête is the all-important one of the year, it is safe to say that few will fail in some way to celebrate the occasion. Let those who wish to form a true picture of British soldiers on Christmas Day think of them as sitting in the trenches at their evening meal and shouting across to the Germans in their trenches, “I say, waiter, you’ve forgotten the soda, you know.” There will be plum puddings in the trenches. Judging by present portents, it is probable that the plum puddings will be eaten under fire. King Albert has placed an order for 40,000 boxes of cigars, which will be given as Christmas presents to Belgian soldiers at the front. Each man will receive twenty-five cigars in a special box. This present will be a delightful Christmas surprise for the troops. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 25, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/1914-christmas-at-the-front/

The director Ryan Coogler’s first feature film, which won a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, carefully reconstructs the last 24 hours of Mr. Grant’s life. Michael B. Jordan (“Friday Night Lights,” “The Wire”) gives Mr. Grant “a fully human presence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, “acknowledging his complexities and contradictions.” The film is steady, subtle and seldom moralistic, Mr. Scott wrote, which is what gives it its power. “The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty, defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audience’s reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry. How could this have happened? How did we — meaning any one of us who might see faces like our own depicted on that screen — allow it?”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday.html
2014-12-26,"The East Village, in the 1980s and Looking Back","Ken Schles, who photographed a Manhattan neighborhood in the mid-80s, edited the work into two books, one in 1988 and one this year, whose tone is strikingly different.","A byword for New Year’s Eve parties: How much fun you have often depends on where you’re standing. Ken Schles, 54, spent the mid-1980s living and taking photographs in the East Village, and twice he edited his work into books — the first time when the photos were taken, and the second time more recently. The differences in mood are striking. The first book, “Invisible City” (1988), which Mr. Schles created while living on a drug-ravaged block on Avenue B, reflects the turmoil and death in his life at the time. “My friends were dying of AIDS, and I was living in an abandoned building,” he said. A quarter of a century later, when he went back to the work, it was as someone who had survived the era, and the images revealed themselves to him in a different light. The resulting book, “Night Walk” (2014), is the retrospective glance of a father of two living in Fort Greene, in Brooklyn. It is “much more about the people and the vitality,” he said. “There’s an excitement about going out. In ‘Invisible City,’ there’s a darkness to the book.”",New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/the-east-village-in-the-1980s-and-looking-back.html

2014-12-26,1914: Christmas Shows in London,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Theaters in London put on Christmas shows in 1914.,"LONDON — Sir Herbert Tree’s production of ‘‘David Copperfield,’’ adapted by Mr. Louis N. Parker, was given its initial performance at His Majesty’s Theatre on Thursday evening [Dec. 24], and it proved a rare Christmas Eve treat. Sir Herbert, in the dual role of Micawber and Daniel Peggotty, was never seen to better advantage, and the difficult task of adapting Dickens for the stage was carried out remarkably well. There was a great ovation at the end, and the audience insisted upon a speech from Sir Herbert, who replied with the modesty of a schoolgirl, but with evident gratitude. Judging from the dress rehearsal of the ‘‘Sleeping Beauty Re-Awakened,’’ at Drury Lane, this pantomime will be a great favorite of the festive season. During one of the intervals, the band played ‘‘Tipperary,’’ and everyone in the audience joined in with such relish that encore after encore followed. At the Lyceum, Miss Louise Beckman will be the hero of ‘‘Jack and the Beanstalk,’’ and Miss Doris Dean will be the pretty princess. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 26, 1914",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/1914-christmas-shows-in-london/

This contingent, composed of about two hundred well-trained, sun-browned men from the Antipodes, is the first to reach Britain from any section of the imperial realm of King George VI. The squadron, which was schooled in Australia and is operating four-engine Sunderland flying boats, will be attached to the coastal command in the Royal Air Force after the completion of a course of advanced training at a British air base.

Over on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list, the usual categories are doing well — healthy eating, financial management, the collected wisdom of Oprah Winfrey — but so is one of the barmier housekeeping guides in recent memory: Marie Kondo’s “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” (No. 5 after eight weeks), which admonishes readers to get rid of any belongings that fail to “spark joy.” Kondo is something of a sensation in her native Japan, where her decluttering system has been featured in a TV movie and created such demand for her services that she’s temporarily stopped accepting new clients. It’s easy to see the appeal: Who couldn’t use a nudge to re-evaluate their tottering piles of stuff? But Kondo’s obsessive-compulsive asceticism comes wrapped in a moony New Age haze that recommends, for instance, thanking your shoes for their hard work or communing with your outfits by fondling them. “It is very natural for me to say thank you to the goods that support us,” Kondo told The Associated Press recently. “The inside of a house or apartment after decluttering has much in common with a Shinto shrine, . . . a place where there are no unnecessary things, and our thoughts become clear.” Maybe so. But if I had to deep-six everything in my house that didn’t spark joy, I might be left with nothing but chocolate, beer and — still — far too many books.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Roaring Twenties? Hardly. The late-20th-century free-love movement? Not even close. The Victorian era is, unquestionably, the sexiest. What’s hotter than anxiety and repression? Or more titillating than the chasm between public and private behavior, between the pedestal-placing of the wife/mother and the enormous rise in prostitution? It’s no coincidence that one of the most erotic characters in literature, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, appeared in 1897, toward the end of Queen Victoria’s reign. (Remember: He had to leave Transylvania and come to England to feast upon pure blood, and open all those untouched . . . necks.)

It’s a case of literary jet lag. You’ve been with Johnson to secret chambers within the pyramids of Giza and foul trenches in the sewers of old Chicago; you’ve looked through telescopes on Mauna Kea and peered into microscopes with 19th-century bacteriologists. You’ve had to move around space and time to do this, but more crucially, you’ve had to wander back and forth through passageways that connect technological history with politics, economics and culture. Have you ever wondered why flash photography led to antipoverty programs at the turn of the 20th century? Or how the invention of the laser contributed to the decline of mom-and-pop stores? Of course you haven’t, because you didn’t really stop to think — wait, check that; I didn’t really stop to think — how the invention of flash photography finally allowed Jacob Riis to capture the images of dismal tenement life on New York’s Lower East Side that he had already been writing about, with little impact, for years. Or how the laser begat the bar code that, in turn, gave an efficiency advantage to stores like Target and Walmart. “How We Got to Now” is full of nifty connections like these — stories that illustrate obscure chains of causality that shaped the modern world. We’ve gone from making cave paintings to using slender slabs of powerful technology like the iPhone 6. But it’s hardly been a linear path. Johnson shows the meandering process by which we’ve made this journey, and what sort of cultural waves ripple outward as we move ahead.

It is a source of wisdom.” So begins the third chapter of Adam Nicolson’s highly accessible new book, “Why Homer Matters,” in which he compares his relationship with epic poetry to a form of possession, a “colonization of the mind by an imaginative presence from the past.” The world needs more Adam Nicolsons, unabashedly passionate evangelists for the power of ancient poetry to connect us with our collective past, illuminate our personal struggles and interrogate our understanding of human history.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/why-homer-matters-by-adam-nicolson.html

2014-12-27,What’s on TV Saturday,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014) Wes Anderson summons the spirit of Stefan Zweig, the early-20th-century Viennese writer, in this tale about the mercurial concierge (Ralph Fiennes) of a fictional 1930s European ski resort — his exceptional service includes fulfilling his female guests’ sexual needs. Framed for the murder of an aristocratic lover (Tilda Swinton) who bequeathed him a valuable painting, he conspires with his lobby boy (Tony Revolori) to prove his innocence in exchange for naming him his heir. Tom Wilkinson plays the aging writer who, in 1985, recounts the story in this flashback-in-a-flashback setup. Jude Law is his younger self who, in 1968, learns of the caper from the proprietor (F. Murray Abraham) of the hotel, now a kitschy Iron Curtain vestige of its former glory. With its quintessential Anderson moments — as when inmates escape from prison using tiny implements concealed in frothy pastries — the film “will delight his fans, but even those inclined to grumble that it’s just more of the same patented whimsy might want to look again,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. While Hitler and Stalin don’t exist in Mr. Anderson’s fantasy world, “this movie makes a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures. You can call this escapism if you like. You can also think of it as revenge.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/27/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday.html

2014-12-28,United Arab Emirates Ban ‘Exodus’ Movie,The United Arab Emirates have become the third country to ban Ridley Scott’s $140 million film about the biblical story of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt.,"The United Arab Emirates have become the third country to ban “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” Ridley Scott’s $140 million film about the biblical story of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt. The decision was made because of the film’s “many mistakes not only about Islam but other religions, too,” Juma Obeid Al Leem, director of media content tracking at the National Media Council, told the English-language newspaper The Gulf News. The announcement came on the heels of announcements that the film would not be shown in Morocco and Egypt because of its portrayal of Moses, as well as historical inaccuracies and giving “a Zionist view of history.” “Exodus,” produced by 20th Century Fox, was previously criticized for having white actors in the leading roles — including Christian Bale as Moses — despite being set in Egypt. It has had tepid results at the box office, taking in $52.5 million in domestic ticket sales since opening nationwide on Dec. 12, according to Box Office Mojo. It’s not the first time Arab countries have banned Hollywood films because of religion: Darren Aronofsky’s “Noah” was barred in several countries in the spring, and the animated movie “The Prince of Egypt” was forbidden in Egypt in 1998.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/movies/united-arab-emirates-ban-exodus-movie.html

But for a replica of that Texas landmark, above, neglect may be the biggest foe. Alamo Village, a 400-acre set built in the late 1950s for John Wayne’s movie  “The Alamo,” is slowly losing the battle against time and nature, The Associated Press reported. More than 100 additional productions, including movies and music videos, were filmed at the site, about 120 miles west of the actual Alamo in downtown San Antonio. The set contained more than 200,000 square feet of permanent buildings, including a church, blacksmith shop and a jail, according to the Texas State Historical Association. For several decades it was a popular tourist destination, drawing hundreds of daily visitors at its height for musical shows and staged gunfights. But attendance waned in the 1980s as traffic shifted north after the completion of Interstate 10, The A.P. reported. The set was put up for sale in 2004 by Virginia Shahan, who took over operations after the death in 1996 of James T. Shahan, her husband and founder of Alamo Village. It was eventually closed in 2010, about a year after Ms. Shahan died. The site is now mostly used for cattle grazing and hunting, and some buildings are beginning to succumb to the elements, The A.P. reported. David Jones, a businessman in Corpus Christi, Tex., hopes to bring tourists back to Alamo Village. He told The A.P. he is close to raising the $8 million he estimates is needed to buy the property and turn it into a Texas version of Old Tucson, a theme park in Arizona.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/movies/the-set-for-the-alamo-hopes-to-live-again-as-a-theme-park.html

He also seems to be its inspiration: Since its release, “Super 8” has drawn usually unfavorable comparisons to “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” and especially to “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” “Still,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, "" ‘not as good as E.T.’ is not so bad.” The film, directed by the Spielberg admirer J. J. Abrams, is about a group of young teenagers (including Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee, Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) in 1979 who are filming a low-budget zombie movie when they witness a violent train derailment. They can’t see much in the chaos of the crash, but it’s possible that their camera saw more. While they wait for the film to be developed, strange things begin happening in their town. Dogs and people disappear, electronics go missing, and the streets fill with soldiers. Mr. Abrams, Mr. Scott wrote, captures his protagonists and their era “with a sense of period detail that sits right on the line between uncanny and neurotic.” He added: “His 1979 is more like 1979 than the real 1979, which hardly seemed like a time of innocence and eager wonder. But no time ever does, except in retrospect.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/arts/television/whats-on-tv-tuesday.html

Its drill bit, dropped from a 160-foot derrick, could plunge 600 feet into the sea, then bore another 20,000 feet into the seabed, where it could verify the existence of oil deposits that were otherwise a geologist’s best guess.

Afterward, I could hardly stop listening to the outstanding 1998 recording of the complete score Valery Gergiev made for Philips with what was then still being called the Kirov Orchestra (now the Mariinsky).
