2023-10-05,‘Fair Play’ Review: Risky Bonds,One couple can’t achieve work-life balance is in this impeccable debut feature from Chloe Domont.,"“Fair Play” is a superbly malevolent erotic thriller about two ambitious financial analysts who drink too much, sleep too little and cannot afford to bring their feelings to work. The trouble is that Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) are secretly engaged — a tension aggravated when their boss, Campbell (an intimidating Eddie Marsan), promotes her over him. “I’m so happy for you,” Luke manages to croak. Emily believes him (briefly) but Chloe Domont, the writer and director of this impeccable debut feature, suspects this couple might not survive her cutting observations on money, gender and power. Domont doesn’t destroy their bliss with a sledgehammer; she uses a shiv. The agony that follows is a star-making performance for Dynevor and a star-correcting one for Ehrenreich who, in playing a nepotism hire confounded by his first brush with failure, reminds audiences why we’ve been rooting for the actor to succeed.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/movies/fair-play-review.html

The film, scripted by Friedkin himself, is the latest adaptation of a stage warhorse: Herman Wouk’s play “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,” the author’s dramatization of the trial portion of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Caine Mutiny.” (The 1954 film version, featuring an unmatchable Humphrey Bogart as the unstable Lt.

Farrier directed and co-stars in an account of those events that can rightly be called a documentary horror film.

Not the climate change disaster itself, which is tangential to the plot, but the sight of great actors throwing themselves into this material, as if they were slogging through a Tennessee Williams marathon instead of the equivalent of a distended “Twilight Zone” episode with an aesthetic that might be described as “Dorothea Lange filter.”",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/movies/foe-review.html

Roussimoff and his camera crew — including the cinematographer and director Ellen Kuras — crept about the lower depths of 1980s Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens shooting an underground horror movie in 16-millimeter black-and-white film.

Nathan Lane, in particular, comes across as a living illustration of the words “game” and “trooper.” He and his co-star Megan Mullally, pros that they are, elegantly suggest hints of disbelief at just how they ended up in a movie in which his character spits pre-chewed cold cuts into the gaping maws of hideous puppet monsters and hers complains that her vagina has flown away (at one point it attaches itself to someone like the facehugger in “Alien”).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/movies/dicks-the-musical-review.html

The 34-room all-inclusive hotel, opening Oct. 13, is set on 230 tree-filled acres in New York’s Catskills region. Activities include guided bird-watching and pine-needle weaving, but the core purpose of the property is to serve as a wellness retreat. Guests will be offered a survey with questions such as “How structured do you like your days?” and “Would you like to move or rest?” The answers are meant to inform a daily itinerary created by the Hemlock team, which might include animal therapy with an on-site herd of goats or a morning cardio dance class. At the spa, nature-inspired treatments such as the Neversink Ice and Stone Ritual, which involves an herb-infused cold water bath, a hot steam shower and a hot river-stone massage, are available for an added charge. The property’s design draws from the region’s Quaker heritage, with a neutral color palette, ash and walnut furniture and quilt-inspired custom wool rugs by Manhattan’s Crosby Street Studios.

Even white pigment, which has frequently appeared in Martinez’s pieces since his 2018 “White Out” series, has a charged presence, boldly countering a base painting or washed thinly across the canvas so that the ghost of an underlying color peeks through. His teeming works seem, on the one hand, to be urgently composed, but the carefully accrued coats of paint — sprayed, silk-screened or directly applied from pigment sticks — also point to an artist who knows how to surrender to the pace set by his materials. “I need the paint to dry to produce the layers,” Martinez tells me one overcast afternoon in his studio in Ridgewood, Queens, ahead of his solo show at London’s Timothy Taylor gallery, opening October 12. The walls are hung with pieces in varying stages of completion. He pauses in front of one and leaves a single, deliberate stroke of brown. “I have to override my impatience for the sake of letting it become the painting it needs to become,” he says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/t-magazine/eddie-martinez.html

2023-10-10,Noma Co-Founder Opens a Restaurant in Brooklyn,"Mads Refslund’s latest, in Greenpoint, celebrates grilled and chilled ingredients; a teahouse finds influence in Japan and Italy; and more food news.","Some new restaurants are opportunistic, the result of circumstance. Others, like the Danish chef Mads Refslund’s new Brooklyn project, are years in the planning — eight years exactly, said Mr. Refslund, a founder of Noma in Copenhagen. What he set out to achieve is a fluid fine-dining concept, where the cooks are the servers. “Everyone is a cook,” he said. “They can best explain the food to the customers, but turning cooks into waiters is a challenge.” There are 26 of them, all dressed in black and rotating their stations. They’re in full view at work: The dining room amounts to a huge square kitchen, surrounded by 58 counter and table seats, and a bar and a lounge in an industrial space — previously a rubber factory — with a white brick 1930s facade. The restaurant’s menu lists ingredients, each of which can be ordered, in consultation with a cook/waiter, hot or cold, grilled or chilled, or, as the name has it, fire (ild in Danish) and ice (is). The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison. Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal (priced per item) patrol the dining area. The menu is à la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ($150); some are served family-style. The 18-seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement. Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman, his chef de cuisine (who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar, his previous gig, is any indication), are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber, venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes, tuna lightly roasted on kombu, grilled wild duck with plum juice, grilled sea scallop dumplings, surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink, and smoked barbecued eel. On Sundays, meals are served family style, starting at noon, no reservations. (Opens Wednesday)",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html

It comprises 251 seats — a mere hamlet in the vast 64,000-seat general kingdom of the place, but it was our hamlet, and on the last Saturday in July, we took up each one of those seats and watched, our collective breath held, as Taylor Swift emerged from a bevy of billowing pastel parachutes and rose up on a platform to perform the 47th show of her Eras Tour. A few songs in, she announced, laughing, that her father told her that Santa Clara had named her its honorary mayor during her two-night stay there and that the entire town had been renamed Swiftie Clara. On the way in, we saw the Police Department cheerfully exchanging friendship bracelets with legions of Swifties. The microcosm of Section 301 offered this same sense of sorority. What a nice neighborhood we had moved into, my 15-year-old son, Ezra, and I. Within minutes of sitting down, we were already a community with a shared, ardent sense of purpose.

That includes the opening of a clutch of new hotels, like Farasha Farmhouse, a four-room boutique property. Formerly an artist’s private retreat, Farasha, which lies 30 minutes outside of the city center, is the vision of Rosena and Fred Charmoy. The Marrakesh-based couple are the founders of Boutique Souk — a local high-end events company popular with visiting celebrities and fashion brands (their client list includes Chanel and Saint Laurent) — and are known for their theatrical, over-the-top parties and weddings. Farasha, though, is a more tranquil endeavor. “We loved the mountain views on both sides of the property,” says Rosena, referring to the Atlas and Jbilet ranges that appear to envelop the acres of olive groves and herb gardens. The two-story main building, which holds three suites and the soaring, open-plan common space, is complemented by a neighboring stand-alone cottage. To furnish the place, the Charmoys turned to local creative friends: floors are laid with custom tapestries from Beni Rugs; sculptures were installed by the Moroccan contemporary artist Amine El Gotaibi; and the book collection comes from the family estate of Diana Vreeland, the legendary former editor of Vogue, donated to the hotel by her son Freck, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Morocco. Food here is similarly considered, overseen by the chef Aniss Meski. The olive oil is made on-site, most vegetable dishes use the farm’s produce and a flock of chickens provides a daily supply of fresh eggs. And if the prospect of snagging one of only four guest rooms seems like a tall challenge, fear not: six more will be available to book starting next year.

2023-10-20,"What to See, Eat and Buy in Porto, Portugal’s Creative Hub","Four insiders share their favorite spots, from old-school seafood restaurants to ceramics studios.","When the Danish architect Signe Bindslev Henriksen first visited Porto a decade ago, she was struck by its neglected grace. Touring late-19th-century houses, she noted the high ceilings, inlaid wood floors and carved moldings, all of which were beginning to buckle. “It felt like there had been a past that was so much more beautiful and vibrant,” Bindslev Henriksen says. That past is now the present: In short order, Portugal’s second-largest city has transformed from a quiet, industrious town into a lively creative hub. It is flush with concept shops and casual fine-dining restaurants. Young winemakers and sommeliers are bringing a fresh perspective to old vineyards. Expats are returning home to be part of the revival. Attribute some of it to the costs and crowds in other European destinations. But chefs and designers are also drawn to the innate charms of the city, whose roots go back thousands of years. The settlement on the Douro River near the Atlantic Ocean became an important port for the Romans, who dubbed it Portus Cale and are believed to have made wine along the riverbanks. The centuries brought other conquerors, including the Visigoths, the Spanish, the Moors and the French, and a wide range of architectural styles. The city’s historic center is a collection of medieval, Baroque, Gothic, and neo-Classical buildings, many with a through-line of local granite that continues into the present day.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/t-magazine/locals-guide-porto-portugal.html

Diego Moya, the group’s culinary director and a chef who rose to prominence during his pre-Covid stint at Racines, in TriBeCa, is the executive chef here, with Joseph Gaglio as his chef de cuisine. The restaurant takes its name from Clara Driscoll, who was in charge of the women’s glass-cutting department at Tiffany Studios from 1892 to 1909. She designed many Tiffany lamps, some of which are in the museum’s outstanding collection. A few Tiffany pieces and other items from that era fill the shelves that decorate the airy, off-white dining room but, like shards of truffle over pasta, not enough to make a statement. Mr. Moya’s menu has its eye on New York history with a lobster Newburg and a charlotte russe. Other dishes, like winter chicories with green goddess dressing, fluke crudo, carrot tartare, duck breast au poivre, steelhead trout and bay leaf mousse with burnt cranberries, depend on local and regional purveyors. The adjacent Café 77 for salads, sandwiches and other quick-serve items, run by Purslane, Oberon’s catering division, will open in two weeks.

So, too, the human voice of the poem begins lost — ready to worship but bereft of a God. In the “blue blue night” of despair, human and animal alike retain a creaturely innocence. Even the title — a pop-culture hand-me-down — underlines the innocence and ordinariness of a shared and painful predicament, the guiltless way any of us might find ourselves heading in the wrong direction. The small and unsatisfying light of the library and the deceptive brightness of the neon instigate the poem’s revelation: By these small lights, and with our fellow creatures, we learn there is a greater light to which we may return.

Trump’s presidency was a period not just of steady growth and low unemployment, but also of growth that was more widely shared than in much of the recent past — with the strongest improvement in median incomes since the 1990s, wage growth for middle- and low-income workers outpacing growth for the upper class, and the lowest African American unemployment rate in decades.",Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/opinion/american-dream-neoliberalism.html

For just over a year, her namesake brand, which often references ancient decorative arts, has been creating personalized intaglios in lapis, carnelian, onyx, jade or gold that can be set as rings or spinning pendants. Once you’ve chosen which of the settings and stones to offer your giftee, Prounis will, she says, ask you or the betrothed a series of questions about the couple’s relationship before suggesting a design, which is then etched on the stone by a specialized intaglio carver. Or she’ll present a menu of options — among them, palm trees, clasped hands and olive branches. Prounis’s designs have also included pet portraits, initials and dates. “It’s kind of like an anthropological study of what modern-day people want to inscribe in stone,” she says. And for the newly engaged, an intaglio can also function as a wax seal: perfect for sending off invitations and thank-you notes.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/t-magazine/engagement-gift-guide.html

It was a cloudless morning in mid-August in Middlebury, Vt., and I had gone to meet Nunez, a petite woman of almost suspicious good cheer, to talk about her half-century-long writing career. She had come up from her home in New York City to give a reading — from her new, ninth novel, “The Vulnerables,” which appears this week — at the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference. Through time, Robert Frost, Toni Morrison and George R.R. Martin have all read at Bread Loaf. Nunez was joining those names, an unlikely advent. She didn’t publish a novel until she was in her 40s and wasn’t able to live on her writing until — 47 years after she began — she won the National Book Award, at 67, for “The Friend.” That novel became an international best seller, translated into more than 30 languages. I wondered how Nunez had managed such persistence. ",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/magazine/sigrid-nunez.html
