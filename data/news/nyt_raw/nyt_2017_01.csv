2017-01-04,"New York Jewish Film Festival: Sisters, Hummus and Bette Midler","Dorit Hakim’s first feature, “Moon in the 12th House,” is among 29 movies in this annual festival.","Dorit Hakim’s first feature, “Moon in the 12th House,” has none of the overeagerness and overstatement that often characterize directors’ initial efforts. Perhaps that’s why it was chosen to be the opening film Wednesday, Jan. 11, at the New York Jewish Film Festival, which runs through Jan. 24. It’s the story of estranged sisters (Yaara Pelzig and Yuval Scharf) who have forged very different paths, one caring for their frail father, the other working at a hot Tel Aviv club. When events throw them back together, the chasm between them doesn’t simply disappear; it must be painstakingly bridged. Both the director and Ms. Scharf are to be on hand for Wednesday’s two screenings at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. The festival features 28 other films and shorts, an eclectic selection that includes “Shalom Rabin,” Amos Gitai’s diary of the time surrounding the Oslo Accords; “Bette Midler: The Divine Miss M,” in which Ms. Midler revisits career high points; and, for foodies, “Hummus! The Movie.” (nyjff.org)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/movies/new-york-jewish-film-festival-sisters-hummus-and-bette-midler.html

Now she sells jars at House of Voltaire, the annual pop-up store curated by the arts charity Studio Voltaire, and at her own shop just off East London’s Chatsworth Road, where she sells her small-batch conserves alongside ceramics, cookbooks and culinary paraphernalia.

2017-01-06,"With Rise of Body Cameras, New Tests of Transparency and Trust","Police departments are dropping a new technology into the middle of a complicated reality between officers and citizens, hoping it will heal public trust.","Body-worn cameras are reshaping perceptions of policing. The small devices, typically mounted on officers’ shirts, provide a lens into law enforcement that is meant to build transparency and trust. But their increased use has also raised a host of questions and concerns: Who should have access to recordings? How will the footage be used? What are the privacy rights of people caught on video? And what are the long-term costs to taxpayers? Across the country, police departments large and small are rolling out expensive body-camera programs without consistent answers to the questions or, according to policy experts, convincing evidence that the cameras ensure the level of accountability that the public demands. Already, at least 19 states have enacted laws restricting public access to  footage, and a dozen more are proposing legislation. This four-chapter video series examines the challenges and incentives — social, political and economic — surrounding the rapid rise of police body cameras. Our story begins in Cincinnati, with a pitch for their use to officers in training.",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/police-body-cameras.html

In New York alone, she has made the Metrotech Commons in Brooklyn into an exploded technicolor landscape, filled with jagged forms that suggested an Abstract Expressionist canvas turned into scree, and she transformed a derelict Army building in the Rockaways in Queens into a magenta-and-white-streaked waterside mirage, using a hydraulic lift and power sprayer to do the job. (“The most interesting thing about the spraying from a big industrial gun,” Ms. Grosse said, “is that it makes you so much bigger.”) Now she arrives on perhaps the biggest commercial stage in the New York art world. Her first gallery show in the city, at Gagosian in Chelsea, opening Thursday, Jan. 19, features work from the past year that continues to blur the distinction between two and three dimensions, borne of the conviction, as she once said, that “paint has to be voluminous if it is to achieve presence.” (Through March 11; gagosian.com.)",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/arts/design/katharina-grosse-gallery-show.html

She has soaked up a history of women’s punk, post-punk and grunge, glancing toward Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Go-Gos, Sleater-Kinney and Hole among others, and she makes melody a priority whether a song barrels ahead at punk speed or digs into a sharp-elbowed midtempo riff. On “Apocalipstick,” Cherry Glazerr has grown from three members to four, and it moves beyond the lo-fi sound and throwaway sarcasm of the band’s debut. Ms. Creevy, 19, has a lot on her mind: female solidarity, junk food, insecurity, wildness, even thoughts about professionalism. And she sings like she has most of the answers.

Worrisome stuff, of course — but a little vague. If, as any historian will tell you, people in all times and places have been alarmed by this development (the ancient Romans called it pugna verborum, or “the battle of words”), you might wonder how urgent, or even actual, the trouble really is. Then there’s the problem of definition. One man’s civility is another man’s repression. Were the Act Up protesters in the 1980s so indecorous as to disqualify themselves from political conversation, as their critics charged? Or were they the ones demanding civility, in the form of simple recognition of the lives of people with AIDS? Is Donald Trump dangerously boorish?

It’s not all questionable science and impossible aspirations, though. “The Telomere Effect,” an anti-aging book new at No. 15 on the hardcover nonfiction list, was written by a couple of honest-to-God scientists: Elizabeth Blackburn, president of the Salk Institute and a 2009 Nobel laureate in medicine, and Elissa Epel, a health psychologist who directs the Aging, Metabolism and Emotion Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The quick version of their book, and their research, is that our chromosomes rely on protective caps (called telomeres) akin to the tips that keep shoelaces from fraying; healthy living, they claim, can preserve or even restore those caps to slow the effects of aging. “Move your body,” Blackburn advised listeners of WNYC radio this month, in an interview with the journalist Jonathan Capehart in which she also casually deployed the correct term for those shoelace tips. (They’re aglets.) “Everyone thinks, ‘Oh, I have to run marathons and join expensive gyms and things like that.’ It turns out really brisk walking, even for short periods of time every day, buffers or alleviates some of the stress-related telomere shortening that happens in chronically stressed people. This is very encouraging, because even if you have a short lunchtime, you can get out and really briskly walk 10 minutes every day. . . .

The Farrells’ way of life is threatened by the world down below and especially by a coal company that wants them evicted so it can mine the mountaintop, a plan that promises jobs and gives the series a current-events peg. Season 1 spent a lot of time on the Farrells’ internal power struggles. In Season 2, the outside world seems likely to be ever more intrusive.

A real bald eagle is made of flesh and feathers and talons — a thing of nature, not a pastiche of concepts. Noble virtues do not map neatly onto apex predators, a fact that troubled Benjamin Franklin as early as 1784.

For the pair — who met while studying men’s wear at the London College of Fashion — it was that experience that triggered a desire to set up a label together. “We felt we did it for someone else and now we wanted to do it for ourselves,” says Bakir. “Kanye is a workaholic and he pushed us to the limits but without that we wouldn’t be prepared for the hours involved in setting up our own brand.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/t-magazine/fashion/cmmn-swdn-mens-wear-emma-hedlund-saif-bakir.html

It’s not exactly a Choose Your Own Adventure, but you can opt either for the pleasure of surprise at the end or for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle as you go along.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/split-review-m-night-shyamalan.html

The vine also produces holdfasts, and is consequently an excellent tree climber, growing aggressively upward, eventually strangling its host.

2017-01-20,The Story Behind This Week’s Best Sellers,"It’s not common for macroeconomists to hit the list, but with “The Great Equalizer” (new at No. 8 in hardcover nonfiction), David M. Smick pulls it off.","Too Big: The word “macroeconomics” doesn’t turn up very often on the best-seller lists. That’s no surprise: With apologies to Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was a genuine phenomenon in 2014, the field isn’t exactly sexy. But here comes David M. Smick, a “global macroeconomic strategist” (in the perky words of his official biography), whose new book, “The Great Equalizer,” argues that government should favor small businesses and entrepreneurs over big corporations; it enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8. Smick was Jack Kemp’s congressional chief of staff in the 1970s and ’80s, and he still leans Republican — he supported Marco Rubio’s presidential run and donated nearly $100,000 to Republican candidates in the last election cycle. But discussing the financial industry and its excesses, he can sound as fiery and populist as any Bernie Sanders stump speech. “The true shame of the 2008 financial crisis is that the big and the powerful were the most protected,” he writes. “It is clear why working families today are so angry. After 2008, if you were a failed, brain-dead Wall Street banker who nearly tanked the world economy, you had easy access to the Federal Reserve’s cheap liquidity. If you failed as a giant bank, you were considered special. Your bank could systemically bring down the entire financial system. But if you were a struggling enterprise out there alone with a brilliant idea that could someday employ thousands of people, obtaining financing was next to impossible. The normal sources of risk capital had dried up, but no one from Washington, D.C., was there with your safety net. The too-big-to-fail banks enjoyed a cost of borrowing far lower than other firms because financial markets became convinced government authorities would never let the big banks go under. The fix was in.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

But now, there’s another — and far more unexpected — trend: rustic, woodsy necklaces. At Prada in Milan, ornamental twigs dangled from feather and chain necklaces, offsetting looks of leather and fur. At the Loewe exhibition in Paris, Jonathan Anderson stayed tied to his penchant for the homemade, presenting chains with carved dogs’ heads along with earrings in the shape of miniature brass trumpets.

But the humble part, you’ll notice, came first: As a self-educated frontier jack-of-many-trades, he was humble to begin with, not humbled by his own political success.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/calling-yourself-humbled-doesnt-sound-as-humble-as-it-used-to.html
2017-01-24,Will France Sound the Death Knell for Social Democracy?,"As a presidential election approaches this spring, even workers in the country’s rust belt are embracing right-wing populism.","One afternoon in September, Franck Sailliot marched through the northern French city of Lille alongside a couple of thousand leftist trade unionists and students. The marchers waved union flags, blew whistles, bellowed slogans. “Enough, enough, enough of this society, where there’s only unemployment and insecurity!” they yelled. “We don’t want the law of the bosses! The only solution is to revoke it!” Sailliot, a 48-year-old trade unionist who had worked much of his adult life in a paper mill in a town about an hour’s drive to the east, shuffled along, mostly silent, his hands in his pockets. As the demonstrators made their way through Lille’s town center, passing the ornate 17th-century stock exchange, they shouted, “Fire the stockholders!” and “Everything they have, they stole it!” One man wielded a bloodied, severed mannequin head and waved a French flag emblazoned with the silhouette of Robespierre, who presided over the Reign of Terror. It was a revolution of sorts, but Sailliot seemed a bit bored. The French left has long protested the encroachment of an unbridled free market, and despite some victories in halting its progress, the overall trend was one of demoralizing defeat. Sailliot debated peeling off from the crowd early and grabbing a beer.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/will-france-sound-the-death-knell-for-social-democracy.html

She was wearing a T-shirt from her first Dior collection printed with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s line “We Should All Be Feminists,” worn underneath a black wool “Bar” jacket from the same collection, whose name and curvaceous silhouette is an homage to the tailleur Bar, a suit from Dior’s 1947 debut. Fashion often echoes the mood of the times, subconsciously or otherwise. Yves Saint Laurent designed a collection inspired by the May 1968 Paris riots; by contrast, Dior’s “New Look” was a salve for the wounds of wartime, making people forget the hardships and revel in luxury. For her collection, Chiuri interprets the “New Look” again, in ivory organza with a peplum of pleats above wide chiffon culottes. It’s an ensemble whose inherent lightness and elastic ease of movement feels like a reflection of that juxtaposition of contemporary feminism (the slogan T-shirt) and historical throwback (the Bar jacket) currently on her own back.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/t-magazine/fashion/maria-grazia-chiuri-dior-couture-show.html

We jet off to foreign countries, on dates predetermined by a higher power (yoga instructors, dietitians), to eat raw meals and practice downward dog alongside complete strangers. In an essay on “The End of Relaxation,” the writer Sadie Stein pointed out that trendy wellness retreats appeal, in large part, by offering the ultimate luxury: freedom from having to make any decisions, since the itineraries are decided for you. And in our day to day, we’re more likely than ever to spare ourselves the agony of having to decide where to go or what to do — and just stay in (lest our choices disappoint us). The writer Molly Young explored the phenomenon for T (“Is Staying In the New Going Out?”), offering as explanation that staying in is low-risk, reliable, easier. She writes about going out, on the other hand: “We do it for the possibility of encountering the spectacular. This rarely happens.” Or, it could happen all the time — if you venture out to a magical place where spectacular encounters are the fabric of everyday life, as they are at Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/t-magazine/travel/greyfield-inn-cumberland-island-chasing-spectacular-encounters.html

As Michael Glatze, a gay-rights agitator who struggled to become a straight Christian pastor, Mr. Franco broods and puzzles and vacillates. But he often seems abandoned by a director whose approach is so noncommittal and dramatically limp that it strands the actor, and his character, in a bland purgatory of conflicting motivations.",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/movies/i-am-michael-review-james-franco-zachary-quinto.html

It’s Brazil — where slaves vastly outnumbered Portuguese colonists, and where today just over half the population identifies as black or pardo (that is, of mixed racial origin). Unlike in the United States, where the legacy of slavery endures in our binary concepts of “black” and “white,” Brazilians have a flexible and plural variety of racial categories, and matters of identity in the two most populous countries in the Americas don’t always run in parallel. Yet enduring inequities between lighter- and darker-skinned Brazilians, and between the richer south of the country and the poorer north, have always contradicted Brazil’s fantasy of racial concord.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/arts/design/when-predator-and-prey-are-one-a-brazilian-artists-fish-tale.html

So before going to bed, drink three full glasses of water — not beer or wine, because they suppress R.E.M. sleep — which will force you to get up and go to the bathroom. “Middle-of-the-night awakenings are frequently accompanied by dream recall,” Stickgold says. “In addition, many people will notice hypnagogic dreams, or those brief dreams that occur as one is falling asleep.”",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/magazine/how-to-remember-your-dreams.html

It makes sense, then, that Poirier’s recent book, “Out of Print,” is published by City Lights, the venerable San Francisco publishing house and bookstore founded in 1953. City Lights published Frank O’Hara, along with Allen Ginsberg and many others who first fused some of the same styles that Poirier continues to explore. Here, Poirier’s short poem somehow manages to capture a national mood, or at least some part of it: Bemused disgust pervades, but there remains a bit of room, perhaps, for optimism.

But he began to get better, and that September he celebrated his second birthday — a milestone that had seemed impossible. Blood work revealed that the cancer had disappeared.

Four years ago, I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales. It felt like another world. The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses. Our nearest neighbor was a farm a 20-minute walk across three fields.

Named for a sci-fi novel that Smithson read in 1967, earthworks represented a new genre of landscape art. Instead of painting a view of nature, sculptors created their own massive works outdoors on mesas, moraines and even the floor of the Mojave Desert. In 1971, Mr. Heizer told me: “You can’t really find a harsher climate than where a majority of my work exists right now. It’s in semiarid, flat, windy, heavy rainy season areas.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/arts/design/robert-smithson-earthwork-art.html

Subtitled “A Sermon to White America,” the book is a stark polemic about race relations, including discussions of police shootings, affirmative action and black-on-black crime (which Dyson sees as a consequence of mere proximity, what he calls “the geography of despair”). But in keeping with an author who has previously written about Bill Cosby and the rapper Nas, among other subjects — and who contributed a list of “blue-eyed soul stars” to his recent interview with The New York Times Magazine — Dyson also makes room for extensive references to pop culture. The book is dedicated to the Knowles women (Beyoncé, Solange and Tina Knowles-Lawson) and includes an early chapter called “Hymns of Praise” in which Dyson singles out a number of politically conscious black musicians as “our griots.” It’s a smart move, since pop music has often provided a channel for white audiences to learn more about black culture. So what artists does Dyson recommend? N.W.A, KRS-One, the Fugees (and their lead singer, Lauryn Hill), Tupac Shakur, Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar and — of course — the “genius and greatest living entertainer,” Beyoncé herself. Of their songs, Dyson writes: “These and a thousand others are the hymns that answer the reign of terror that consumes our days. These are the hymns that rally us against the fantasy of our erasure. May these hymns be sung loud until our slaughter ceases and our blood no longer spills.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/books/review/the-story-behind-this-weeks-best-sellers.html

2017-01-30,Arte Povera Is Back,Fendi fetes a master of the movement at its headquarters in Rome.,"Arte Povera, the politicized avant-garde art movement that blossomed in Italy in the late ’60s, is having a moment. Key works from the period make up the core of the collection of Magazzino, an Italian-centric art space opening in the Hudson Valley later this year; and over in Rome, two shows are celebrating the work of one of its leading practitioners, Giuseppe Penone. The Piedmont-born artist currently has a solo show at Gagosian, and his work also fills the first floor of the Fendi headquarters at Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Originally commissioned by Mussolini, the building’s grandiose architecture stands in stark contrast to Penone’s work, which deals primarily with nature and the elements. The centerpiece of the mini-retrospective will be a new work called “Matrice,” a nearly-100-foot-long cross-sectioned fir tree partially cast in bronze. “It exposes time and the way in which nature imbues necessity into chance,” Penone says. This marks the first foray into exhibiting contemporary art for Fendi, whose C.E.O., Pietro Beccari, adheres to one programming condition: “Everything should be about Italian genius and excellence.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/t-magazine/art/arte-povera-fendi-show.html

To answer: Yes, back in 2000, from a food truck outside the Peking Opera School, which we were visiting in Beijing. They were delicious. I had forgotten about jianbing until very recently, as a few people in New York have started making them. Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong. He decided a few years ago to do something, he said, “that would be interesting and make people happy.” He’d like to do his part to make jianbing as mainstream as ramen. At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork. The stand also sells smashed cucumber salad, steamed dumplings and, soon, an egg, cheese and ham breakfast “bing” and sweet dessert versions. Mr. Goldberg has also taken on a couple of partners and has plans for expansions, including a brick-and-mortar shop opening in March next to his commissary in Chelsea: Mr Bing, UrbanSpace Vanderbilt, 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, mr-bing.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/mr-bing-restaurant-jianbing-news.html
