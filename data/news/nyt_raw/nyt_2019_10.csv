And performances from Chance the Rapper, Alicia Keys and more air on the CW.","HIGH LIFE (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The French director Claire Denis is known for making independent movies that tell intimate, personal stories. But on paper, her first English-language film, “High Life,” doesn’t necessarily shout “intimate.” It’s a sci-fi movie, for one thing, and it accordingly takes place in about the most vast setting possible: space. Robert Pattinson stars as Monte, a young man who has agreed to participate in an extraterrestrial mission in order to avoid the death penalty. He’s traveling on a spaceship as part of a small criminal crew, bound for a black hole in deep space. Also on the ship is a troubled doctor played by Juliette Binoche; other crew members are played by Lars Eidinger and the musician André Benjamin. Their mission is derailed, in part, by an unexpected birth. “As is often the case in Denis’s movies, ‘High Life’ vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “But,” she added, “too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard — outer and inner space, Pattinson’s head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then — more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/arts/whats-on-tv-thursday-high-life-and-the-iheartradio-music-festival.html

2019-10-03,9 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"School is back in session, which for some people means packing lunchboxes and anguishing over outfits in the morning dark, and for other people means muttering about the bus traffic snarling Main Street on the way to the gym. For us, though, back-to-school time is just one more reason to celebrate good books. This week, that includes books about school: Robert Pondiscio’s “How the Other Half Learns,” about a year in the life of the impressive but polarizing charter school network Success Academy, and Paul Tough’s “The Years That Matter Most,” looking at college through the lens of a class system that reinforces its own rigid hierarchy. There’s also Samantha Power’s memoir, “The Education of an Idealist,” which is less about school than about Power’s on-the-job evolution as President Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations. Two books this week tackle prejudice head-on — Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist” and Bari Weiss’s “How to Fight Anti-Semitism” — while Corey Robin’s “The Enigma of Clarence Thomas” upends some conventional wisdom about the Supreme Court justice. Finally, in fiction, we recommend new novels from some old favorites: Ann Patchett, Jacqueline Woodson and the British master Andrew Miller. Don’t think of them as required reading — nobody likes a syllabus — but maybe sneak one of them inside your calculus textbook and enjoy.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/books/review/9-new-books-we-recommend-this-week.html

2019-10-03,An Artist Who Pushes the Borders of His Studio Into the Streets,"Robin Rhode uses city walls as his canvas, challenging the idea of creation as a solitary, private act.","In 2013, the South African-born artist Robin Rhode, whose interdisciplinary practice blends drawing, performance and photography, converted a 19th-century alcohol distillery in Berlin into a vast 16,000-square-foot work space, split across two floors. Still, he continues to make much of his work outside its bounds. While he produces most of his preparatory drawings in Berlin, his primary site of creation has remained in Westbury, a suburb of Johannesburg. There, using the plastered concrete wall of a vacant building as his canvas, he makes fleeting paintings (a shoal of small geometric shapes for the 2012 series “School of Fish,” a spiral staircase for the 2017 work “Principle of Hope”), and invites a performer wearing a mask — oftentimes the dancer Kevin Narain, a collaborator of eight years — to interact with the work, contorting his body to echo its shapes. He captures the dancer’s actions in a sequence of photographs and then scrubs the wall clean in less than 24 hours (although he leaves the vacant building as he found it, he also gives its owner a bottle of whiskey whenever he’s in town). For Rhode, the ephemerality of the movements and the reactionary nature of graffiti art underline the overlooked poverty and injustice permeating urban slums in cities; often he will work with more than a dozen local collaborators on a single piece. “My community are my studio assistants,” he says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/t-magazine/robin-rhode-artist.html

Cummings, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni and Paul Laurence Dunbar,” he says. In addition to starring alongside Natalie Portman in the new film “Lucy in the Sky,” which follows an astronaut’s struggle to readjust to life on Earth after traveling into space, Domingo recently appeared on HBO’s “Euphoria” and is a co-writer of the acclaimed “Summer: Donna Summer the Musical,” which is currently on tour across the U.S. When he’s crafting narratives for any of his projects, whether he’s in front of the camera or behind the scenes, he often returns to the words of his favorite writers. “Poems influenced my love of craftsmanship in telling a story,” he says, “whether in short prose or long form.” The works he revisits again and again have in common “rich language, impeccable phrasing, soul stirring images, and wit,” he says, and so it makes sense that for T’s video series “Read T a Poem,” he chose to recite a work by the South Korean-born American writer Ed Bok Lee, whose insightful, exacting poems reflect the intimate ways globalization is transforming our culture and our lives. Domingo’s selection, “Summer Open Window,” is from Lee’s latest collection, “Mitochondrial Night,” which uses DNA as a central theme in its lyrical exploration of genealogy, geography and time.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/t-magazine/colman-domingo-poem.html

In the midst of this activity, American and British operatives planned to dig a tunnel underneath the city, to intercept communications headed to and from Moscow. In “Betrayal in Berlin,” Steve Vogel, a former longtime reporter for The Washington Post, tells the story of the tunnel’s creation. He also delves into the life of George Blake, a British spy who became a double agent for the Soviets, reporting to them about, among other things, the progress of the tunnel project. Born in the Netherlands, Blake lived an outsize life of both great bravery and great deception. Below, Vogel talks about being inspired by his father’s work for the C.I.A., the similarities between spies and journalists, and tracking down Blake for an interview.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/books/betrayal-berlin-steve-vogel-interview.html

It was both a daunting and heady opportunity for Berlin to reinvent itself and start over. Artists and musicians moved into abandoned breweries, warehouses and basements and slowly brought new life to neighborhoods like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, which in turn attracted people from around the world. But now, thanks to rising rents, Berlin’s gentrified areas have become too expensive for many of its creative residents, and people have begun to move to farther-flung corners of the city. Three such neighborhoods are the historically industrial areas of Treptow-Köpenick, Rummelsburg and Oberschöneweide, 10 or so miles southeast of the city center, where some of Berlin’s most pioneering artists now occupy a string of former industrial buildings along the Spree River. It is in Oberschöneweide, too, that the Berlin gallerist Johann König, who represents several artists who have moved their studios to the area, is currently negotiating to take over and revive an old cable factory that will host artist studios and residencies. Although the area’s landscape may look post-apocalyptic, with its giant weeds and empty power plants, strangely, the future here can seem positively Arcadian: Real estate is still cheap enough that artists are able to buy, rather than rent, their spaces. Here, four artists discuss how their work is shaped by the Spree.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/t-magazine/berlin-artists-spree-river.html

Star-struck by his subject, Warhol offered Dylan a painting: a 1963 silk-screened portrait of Elvis Presley, of whom Dylan once said, “Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.” (The portrait, ironically, is taken from a publicity still of Elvis from the Western film “Flaming Star,” in which he looks very sheriff-like.) Dylan accepted the painting — but was then faced with the problem of maneuvering the nearly seven-foot-long canvas into his station wagon. Finally, he tied it to the roof with the help of his friend, the filmmaker Barbara Rubin. Later, when the artist asked Dylan about the painting, the musician admitted that he’d given it to his manager. “But if you gave me another one, Andy, I wouldn’t make that mistake again,” Dylan reportedly said. Only later did Warhol find out that Dylan had traded the canvas for a sofa. The painting now hangs in New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The last so-called “Ferus Type” Elvis to appear at auction — Warhol made 23 of them in total — was sold at Christie’s for $53 million in May.

Less common, though, is the layout of the couple’s building; to reach the home of Gohar, a Cairo-born artist, and Sosa, a Barcelona-born graphic designer and publisher who co-founded the interiors magazine Apartamento, you must first enter a former tenement built in the mid-19th century on a now-bustling stretch of Spring Street, just west of the Bowery, then walk down a narrow, dimly lit hallway that opens into a 400-square-foot courtyard densely planted with laurel and vivid green birch trees. At the opposite end, down a leaf-strewn brick path, you’ll find a four-story red brick structure. Dating to that same period, it is one of New York’s so-called backhouses, the smaller residences that landlords erected in the 19th century behind the cover of larger buildings to increase rent revenue. Despite its origins, the building, which now has five units, is calm and oasis-like. At once hemmed in and bucolic, it evokes the dwelling in Virginia Lee Burton’s 1942 children’s book, “The Little House,” the looming metropolis pressed up against it.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/t-magazine/laila-gohar-omar-sosa-apartment.html

Here’s where we left the major characters.,"Six years ago, AMC’s award-season juggernaut “Breaking Bad” came to a bloody and satisfying end, and with it the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), the high school science teacher who became an Albuquerque drug kingpin.

But given that shift in focus — and all the carnage of the final “Breaking Bad” season — it was reasonable to think that the finale was the last word otherwise.

Carolina De Robertis’s new novel, “Cantoras,” follows a group of lesbian friends living under a repressive Uruguayan regime. And Tom Segev’s biography “A State at Any Cost” explores the ways that Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, set that country on its path, for better and worse. We also offer some crime books, both fiction and non, along with a political history, a collection of poetry and a modern master’s horror stories.

2019-10-10,An Artist Who Works to Lana Del Rey and the Hum of Cable News,"Jacolby Satterwhite, known for his virtual-reality installations and 3-D-printed sculptures, discusses a pair of new shows — and his daily routine.","Jacolby Satterwhite has spent the past decade making highly wrought digitally animated science-fiction worlds and irreverent modern dance pieces that draw on vogueing and martial arts. But he considers his two current shows, in New York and Philadelphia, to be “the final draft, conceptually, of what I was trying to say for years.” While Satterwhite has long been known as an art-world generalist, his fall exhibitions show him at his most direct. At Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, the exhibition “You’re at Home” brings together his digitally animated video series “Birds in Paradise” (2017-19), in which folkloric motifs and symbols of American consumerism tumble into a video-game world, and his 3D-printed objects, such as coin purses and jewelry boxes, based on drawings made by his mother, Patricia Satterwhite, before her death in 2016. Meanwhile, at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, the show “Room for Living” features a group of works Satterwhite developed during his recently completed two-year residency at the museum. They include figurative sculptures inspired by virtual objects from his video series “Reifying Desire” (2011-14), in which Satterwhite’s own digitally animated avatar navigates a world where his mother’s renderings of household items are realized. The residency has been a homecoming of sorts for the artist, who obtained his M.F.A. in the city in 2010 before moving to New York, where he broke through with his virtual and live-action performances at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the 2014 Whitney Biennial.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/t-magazine/jacolby-satterwhite.html

To keep longtime fans happy, “the episodes are peppered with references from the comic books — adversaries with names like Deathstroke and Count Vertigo — but not so many as to confuse viewers who might not know the source material,” Joe Rhodes wrote in The New York Times. But the time has come for Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) to hang up his bow. As the show enters its eighth and final season, Queen has left his home of Star City to protect the multiverse from impending crisis.

2019-10-15,Letter of Recommendation: Souvenir Photo Viewers,"Immerse yourself in a memory from a simpler, pre-Instagram time.","This past spring, I spent two months subletting an apartment in Amsterdam, where tourists not infrequently outnumber residents. The day I arrived, I was struck by how many American accents I heard and how many selfie sticks jutted out onto the narrow sidewalks near the canals in the Nine Streets. Nothing made tourists more visible than their fervent Instagramming and ever-present iPhones. Jogging in the Vondelpark, I saw a tourist crash a bike while videoblogging. From a hotel lobby on Keizersgracht, I watched someone climb onto a locked bike near the canal, take a photo on it and then go about her afternoon. Ask a local about the tourism in Amsterdam, and you’re likely to receive an eye roll and a comment about how it’s “out of control,” as one cafe owner told me during my first week there. Last year, the city attracted almost 20 million visitors, but there are fewer than one million residents. In December, locals became so frustrated by tourist congestion that the city removed the “I amsterdam” sign near the Rijksmuseum, which reportedly generated upward of 6,000 photographs per day. Many of these photos very likely ended up on Instagram, where the hashtag #iamsterdam has been used 1.54 million times and counting.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-souvenir-photo-viewers.html

2019-10-17,What’s on TV Thursday: A Toni Morrison Doc and ‘Fractured’,A recent documentary about Toni Morrison hits Hulu. And a Hitchcockian thriller with Sam Worthington is on Netflix.,"TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. When her novel “Paradise” was banned in Texas prisons in the 1990s because of the perception that the book had been written to disrupt prison life and could potentially cause strikes or riots,  Toni Morrison had a response that the authorities likely didn’t anticipate. Morrison recalls in this documentary: “I thought, ‘How powerful is that?’” A lengthy interview with Morrison is the ballast of this movie about her, which steers away from telling a typical, straight-ahead story of Morrison’s life and instead offers a kind of meditation on the significance of her work. That is achieved through interviews with, in addition to Morrison, figures like Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Fran Lebowitz, Sonia Sanchez and Robert Gottlieb. “If you want a thorough documentation of everything Morrison has done and everyone she knows, there’s always Wikipedia,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if you’d prefer an argument for her importance and a sense of her presence, then you won’t be disappointed.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-a-toni-morrison-doc-and-fractured.html

Fuji that, he tells Nikil Saval, “gets no use at all.” It’s fitting then, that when T sent Ban an instant camera and asked him to document scenes from his life, the pictures he sent back were mainly of his projects or his inspirations. His images — which show his latest project in Biel, Switzerland, and his office in Paris, where paper-tube shelving houses miniature models of his buildings — offer an intimate look at the Pritzker Prize-winning architect’s work life.

Dahlia Adler gathers 13 (of course) authors — herself included — to retell or reinvent several of Poe’s best-known stories (“The Pit and the Pendulum,” “The Tell-Tale Heart,” “The Purloined Letter”) alongside some of his less anthologized ones (“Hop-Frog,” “The Oval Portrait”), as well as a couple of his famous poems (“The Raven,” “Annabel Lee”). The volume is divided between the new stories and Poe’s originals, which makes for a delightful reading experience; I found myself skipping back and forth between them to better appreciate the authors’ ingenuity.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/books/review/otherworldly-science-fiction-fantasy-amal-el-mohtar.html

2019-10-18,"T Suggests: Animal-Shaped Jewels, a Hotel With a View and More",A roundup of things our editors — and a few contributors — are excited about in a given week.,"Cape Town, in the shadow of Table Mountain on the South African coast, has become one of the most buzzed about travel destinations in Africa in recent years. But while the city’s food and wine scenes continue to flourish, its hotel options have remained limited. The opening of Dorp, a new hotel in the historic Bo-Kaap neighborhood in the city center, known for its colorful Cape Dutch and Georgian style houses, is set to change that. Conceived by the hotelier and clothing designer Gail Behr, who opened the plush old-world Grand Hotel in the South African seaside town of Plettenberg Bay in 2004, the intimate 30-room property is more of a club than a traditional hotel. “It’s old-fashioned without being cloyingly personal and intrusive,” Behr says. Constructed from scratch with the help of the local designer Gregory Mellor, the building was devised to fit antique wooden doors, windows and slatted shutters that the team sourced from as far as India and Egypt. The interior — filled with oversize printed couches, antique cabinets, old books, wood-burning fireplaces and claw-foot bathtubs — was decorated by Behr herself. “I was determined not to take the design too seriously,” she says. “The surrounding mountains cannot be competed with!” Indeed, located on the gently sloping base of Signal Hill, Dorp has astonishing views of Table Mountain and the city’s twinkling lights. One of the best places to enjoy the vista is the hotel’s rambling garden, created by the Cape Town-based landscape designer Leon Kluge and planted with ancient mission olive trees, gnarled guava trees and purple poppies. “The garden is the prettiest place on earth, with millions of butterflies, dwarf Cape chameleons, birds and bees,” Behr says. A light-filled cafe on the ground floor serves unfussy dishes like homemade scones, grilled cheese sandwiches and slow-roasted local lamb. But perhaps Behr’s favorite space is the salon, a great homey living room brimming with couches covered in pink velvet and a playful dinosaur-printed toile by the British interiors brand House of Hackney, where she encourages guests to mingle. Already, she says, it is “filled with interesting people collaborating — and playing a poker game at the same time.” dorp.co.za — MARY HOLLAND",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/t-magazine/dorp-hotel-south-africa-sartorialist-book-style-news.html

2019-10-20,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Watchmen’ and ‘Limetown’,Damon Lindelof’s take on the comic book series airs on HBO. And Jessica Biel stars in a new sci-fi thriller based on a fiction podcast.,"WATCHMEN 9 p.m. on HBO. When the 12-part comic book series “Watchmen” came out in 1986 and 1987, it upended the traditional idea of what a superhero could be. In looking back at that comic for The New York Times, Adam Sternbergh wrote that “Watchmen” “felt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world.” Now, with superhero stories dominating the box office, this new series from the “Lost” and “The Leftovers” creator Damon Lindelof offers a new take on that comic, trading the original’s Cold War themes for those of white supremacy. Regina King stars as Angela Abar, who works with the police as her masked alter ego, Sister Night, while Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart play older versions of original “Watchmen” characters Adrian Veidt and Laurie Juspeczyk.

2019-10-24,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Will & Grace’ and a New David Chang Series,The final season of “Will & Grace” begins on NBC. And a new food travel show with David Chang is on Netflix.,"WILL & GRACE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. “Will & Grace” is ending — again. The sitcom, built on the friendship between its title characters, who are a lawyer and an interior designer, pushed boundaries and helped normalize gay characters in prime time TV during its original run in the late 1990s and 2000s. It was revived for a season that debuted in 2017 and aged up the characters, but left the show’s formula largely untouched: Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) were once again roommates. The 2006 original finale that saw the pair married (separately) with children was explained away as, in part, a dream that never happened. NBC has said that the latest season, the 11th, which debuts Thursday night, is going to be the show’s last. But whatever happens in the new finale may not carry the same stakes as that first one: In theory, it could all be a dream, too.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-will-grace-and-a-new-david-chang-series.html

Petite, silver hair cut distinctively in a short bob, Wilmers had brought a copy of the latest issue — Volume 41, Number 13 — to a bright back room and a desk laden with current British newspapers and magazines. On the cover of The Sun, a photo of Taylor Swift adjoined the headline “Migrant’s 3,500-ft Plunge: Falling Jet Stowaway Lands 3ft From Sunbather.” On the cover of The Times, next to a close-up of a young woman delighting in a rainbow ice pop, ran the headline “Oxfam Staff Still Offering Aid for Sex, Report Claims.” Wilmers’s copy of the L.R.B. featured no photos of women on its cover. Instead, a painting, unblemished by text, depicting an early summer evening in London: dirty pink twilight dissolving behind a stand of trees, deep, unnatural blue overtaking the sky, two silhouetted birds coursing above overground wires. Pretty, striking and, when read with the hot pink headline incised above it — “The Sun Sets on Britain” — a different picture altogether.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/magazine/london-review-of-books-mary-kay-wilmers.html

Most of the rounds fired at our forward operating base were so poorly placed that they had to have a dash of luck to even hit a guard post. They were the untrained shots of amateurs, taken by fathers and brothers who were thrust into war by either circumstance or their ideas about the sacred duty of jihad, neither of which involved the training of a professional soldier. It was our brief age of innocence during Second Battalion, Third Marines’ deployment to Iraq in 2006. We had been largely unscathed by the true essence of war. Roadside bombs had left marks on a few of us. Concussions caused by grenades were joked about. Shrapnel left in the fleshy tissue of camouflaged buttocks were a source of hilarity. A Marine named Gabriel Odum had been shot on his first patrol, the bullet passing through his right hand and one lung, but a few lucky centimeters away from fatal. We believed we were invincible. The casualties were serious, but everyone would walk away, bearing the kinds of scars that would make them celebrities at their respective V.F.W. cantinas.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/magazine/marine-sniper-iraq.html

Hotels, hospitals, and a consumer credit reporting agency have admitted to major breaches.

For reasons left obscure, this occurrence coincides with power failures and the appearance of inky black monoliths all over Earth.

For five and a half days in the dead of winter, a team of mushers and their dogs rushed from Nome and back, covering hundreds of miles to deliver medicine to the beleaguered, icebound city.

About 40 percent of the adults and 19 percent of the children and adolescents in the United States have obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More and more of them face the increased risks of suffering from diabetes, cardiovascular disease and countless other negative health effects.

And “Maleficent” airs on TNT as its sequel plays in theaters.,"DOLEMITE IS MY NAME (2019) Stream on Netflix. Eddie Murphy wears vivid suits and tilted hats and carries a weighty cane in this new biopic. The film casts Murphy as the comedian Rudy Ray Moore, who at the crest of the blaxploitation era self-financed “Dolemite,” a 1975 crime action movie in which he starred as a pimp out for revenge. The original movie became a cult hit. (A typical scene involves an F.B.I. agent being kicked into the trunk of a Cadillac.) The biopic charts the lead-up to and the making of that movie, with the help of an all-star cast: Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and Wesley Snipes play some of Moore’s associates, and Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock each make cameos. The movie has a “loose, friendly, house-party vibe,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, and is intended as a comeback vehicle for Murphy. “I didn’t want to just pop back up,” he said in a recent interview with The Times. “I wanted a funny movie to remind them that they liked me. This movie turned out so strong that I figured this is a great way to come back.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/arts/television/whats-on-tv-friday-dolemite-is-my-name-and-maleficent.html

David Simon’s breakout show “The Wire” articulated how the lives of ordinary people are shaped by the institutions they find themselves caught up in. “The Deuce,” which Simon created with George Pelecanos, has a similar theme. For three seasons the series has shown how changes in the pornography industry in the United States affected the people involved in it. The show’s final season, which concludes Monday, jumped  to the mid-1980s, when VHS technology made it possible for people to watch erotic films easily at home. Some of the show’s characters, like Candy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who went from prostitute to pornographic film director, seem to have prospered amid these changes, while others, like Frankie (James Franco),  have clearly suffered.

In his New York Times review of John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher film “Halloween,” Jason Zinoman wrote that Michael Myers isn’t like other movie monsters: “He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life.” But this take on that film, directed by the heavy metal singer Rob Zombie, upends that idea by exploring Myers’s back story and unmasking his motive to kill. It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. He’s then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, who’s now a teenager.

Prepare to spend time and money. By the 1970s, the fort was mostly ruined and the moat dry, when the local government began excavating the canals and rebuilding; the project took 25 years and went way over budget. “The canals must be deep and wide,” Meendering says: Try eight feet deep and 20 to 40 feet wide. Consider geology and its potential effects on sedimentation. Plan a route across; Bourtange has five wooden drawbridges, but they’re too heavy and dangerous to pull up. Don’t expect your moat to stop swimmers not wearing armor. “A person can easily swim across within a minute if they want,” Meendering says.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/magazine/how-to-build-a-moat.html

We also have a couple of books about felonious women — one of them fictional (Hannelore Cayre’s “The Godmother”) and one of them not (Doris Payne’s “Diamond Doris,” about her career as a jewel thief) — and, for good measure, two poetry collections, a novel about a French chef and a tribal history of the Lakota people stretching from the 16th century to the present.
