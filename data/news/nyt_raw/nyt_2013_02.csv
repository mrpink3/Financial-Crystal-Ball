It is “probable that the origins of tyranny are found nowhere else than in the democratic regime.” (“The Republic”). A just system of government must have a philosopher king, who understands the essences of things. Translated into the modern context, Plato’s view is that the only just system of government is one that is run by one or several experts in economics and public policy.

The opposition leader, Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, said many critics had not fully read the explanations he had posted Wednesday on his Facebook page. Sheik Khatib’s offer to open a dialogue with the government, which contained several conditions, received a measure of support from Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, and Lakhdar Brahimi, the peace envoy for the Arab League and the United Nations. But the offer to start talks broke a longstanding opposition demand: no talks until Mr. Assad steps down. Sheik Khatib said in his Facebook posting that he would be willing to talk with Mr. Assad’s representatives in Egypt, Tunisia or Turkey, all of which support the Syrian opposition. He also demanded other preconditions, including the release of 160,000 prisoners in Syria. “Nobody has said it is going to be easy,” Mr. Brahimi said. “But perhaps negotiating is better than killing each other.” ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/world/middleeast/critics-assail-syrian-opposition-leaders-offer-on-talks.html

They were so excited that they slept in their uniforms — a purple T-shirt with a yellow star kicking the ball with one of its points — the night before their first practice. But when we got to the field the next day, Shepherd’s enthusiasm evaporated. While Beau and the other kids ran zigzags around the cones, Shepherd stood still and looked bewildered. When it was his turn to kick the ball, he seemed lost. After 15 minutes, he walked off the field and sat down in my lap, saying he was too tired to play. We watched the other kids, and I pointed out to him the drills I thought he might enjoy, the ones that Beau was charging through. But he refused to go back to the field. His passivity didn’t concern me much — he was 3, after all, and I already thought of him, in the way that parents tend to categorize their children even as we tell ourselves we shouldn’t, as a little clingy and not especially athletic. My husband, Darin, and I had recently noticed that Shepherd occasionally walked with a limp, but it was faint enough that sometimes when you looked for it, it was gone.

Here was a book that was funny, smart, playful, the feminine present and unapologetically intellectual and erotic. But, finally, impressive as it was, that first collection didn’t do for me what Dickinson claimed great poetry should — make me feel that the top of my head was taken off. In bold and moving contrast, Shaughnessy’s emotionally charged and gorgeously composed third volume of poems, “Our Andromeda,” moves me line by line and poem by poem so that by the book’s final, monumental title poem, I am top-of-the-head-blown-off undone. In “Our Andromeda” Shaughnessy has brought to bear her inevitable syntactic and sonic hula-hooping, her playful and ironic uses of form, her vivid mind on poems that absolutely matter.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/books/review/our-andromeda-by-brenda-shaughnessy.html

2013-02-02,Wounded Candidate in Armenia Likely to Postpone Vote,An opposition presidential candidate who was shot and wounded Thursday outside his home in the capital said Friday that he would probably seek to postpone the Feb. 18 election.," An opposition presidential candidate who was shot and wounded Thursday outside his home in the capital said Friday that he would probably seek to postpone the Feb. 18 election. The candidate, Paruir A. Airikyan, 63, is one of eight opponents challenging President Serzh Sargsyan, who is widely expected to win re-election by an wide margin. Mr. Airikyan was shot in the shoulder by an unknown assailant but is expected to make a full recovery. Investigators offered no immediate motive for the attack. He spent years in Soviet prisons for promoting Armenian independence and was stripped of his citizenship and expelled to Ethiopia in 1988. He lived in Los Angeles before returning to Armenia after the fall of the Soviet Union. He has run for president several times but never won more than a small share of the vote. A provision in the Constitution allows for the postponement of elections by two weeks if a candidate faces an “insurmountable obstacle” and potentially for another 40 days if the obstacle cannot be removed.

2013-02-04,What’s on Monday,Television highlights.,"9 P.M. (HBO) MEA MAXIMA CULPA: SILENCE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD (2012) Alex Gibney documents the case of the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, above, a Roman Catholic priest in Wisconsin who died in 1998 after having molested dozens if not hundreds of children in his care at a boarding school for the deaf, resulting in a trail of denial and cover-up from rural America to the Vatican. Mr. Gibney’s “methods are a blend of solid journalism and cinematic sensationalism,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “The reliance on melodramatic music and lurid — though not explicit — re-enactments does not seem to me to make the movie more powerful, but rather the opposite. There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.” But the heart of the film, “the real source of its emotional impact,” Mr. Scott said, “lies in a remarkable series of interviews with some of the men, most now in their 60s, who endured Father Murphy’s assaults when they were children and who have worked for almost 40 years to bring his crimes to light.” John Slattery, Jamey Sheridan, Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke interpret their words.

2013-02-06,Now Bidding | The ‘Watchmen’ Covers,Comic book fans with deep pockets will have a chance to own a piece of “Watchmen” when covers of the inaugural issues are sold at Heritage Auctions this month.,"Comic book fans with deep pockets will have a chance to own a piece of “Watchmen” when the covers of the first three issues are sold at Heritage Auctions this month, in a sale that ends on Feb. 22; issue No. 1 alone is expected to bring in more than $100,000. (Three additional auctions will follow in May, August and November, each featuring three covers from the original 12-issue series published by DC Comics.) Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, “Watchmen” ushered in a new level of mature storytelling with adult themes and flawed heroes. Gibbons sold the covers and original artwork to “Watchmen” — “pitifully cheap,” he noted — nearly as quickly  as he created it, fearing that there would be no takers. “It seemed like a good idea to me at the time,” he said. “In my experience, the sort of comic art that sold well were kind of money shots — big action shots of the heroes in costumes doing something interesting. I realized that ‘Watchmen’ was filled with a lot of meat and potatoes stuff, people standing around talking, which I didn’t think would be as popular.” The series went on to become a perennial best seller. It was adapted into a live action film that was released in 2009 and, last year, DC began publishing a series of prequels called “Before Watchmen,” which caused some consternation with fans and creators who felt that “Watchmen” should stand alone.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/watchmen/

2013-02-07,What’s On Thursday,Television highlights.,"1:30 P.M. (MoreMax) THE DESCENDANTS (2011) Matt King (George Clooney, in an Oscar-nominated role), a real estate lawyer whose family tree includes the earliest white settlers in Hawaii as well as indigenous royalty, struggles to make the right decision regarding his family’s birthright: a pristine and picturesque tract on Kauai. Should it be sold to developers? In the meantime his wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), is in a coma in a Honolulu hospital after a boating accident. Not long after her doctors inform Matt that he is about to become a widower and a single father to two difficult daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley), he learns that Elizabeth was having an affair. Robert Forster portrays Elizabeth’s enraged father, who blames his daughter’s condition on Matt’s tightwad ways; Matthew Lillard plays Brian, the object of Elizabeth’s affection; Judy Greer is Brian’s wife; Nick Krause (above, with, from left, Mr. Clooney, Ms. Miller and Ms. Woodley) is Alex’s goofy sidekick; and Beau Bridges is Matt’s cousin. Mr. Clooney’s actorly instincts “have never been keener or more generous,” and Ms. Woodley gives “one of the toughest, smartest, most credible adolescent performances in recent memory,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. He added: “Mr. Payne, with a light touch and a keen sense of place — this Hawaii is as real and peculiar as the Nebraska of ‘About Schmidt’ or the California wine country of ‘Sideways’ — has made a movie that, for all its modesty, is as big as life. Its heart is occupied by grief, pain and the haunting silence of Elizabeth, whose version of events is the only one we never hear.

But the embedded commercial is a perfect parody of something that has become very familiar in recent years: a vague and seductive montage of sad and happy scenes accompanied by new-agey music and, interrupting the inspiring sales pitch, a sotto voce recitation of warnings and possible complications.

And now it appears to have set a record for the speed at which it has inspired a hip-hop tribute: “I Can’t Stop Watching House of Cards” is the creation of Adam WarRock (the nom de rap of Eugene Ahn) and it has already earned an endorsement of sorts from the “House of Cards” show runner, Beau Willimon. For the uninitiated, the video won’t spoil any crucial “House of Cards” plot points, though it will give you a thorough introduction to the series star Kevin Spacey’s fluctuating Southern accent.

But he had asked for a NordicTrack machine and 12 down pillows, items that my colleague was scrambling to find. I had no down pillows to spare, but I did, as it happened, have a NordicTrack gathering dust in my basement.

Trading in ill-considered choices, they have made a habit of letting folks down — their women, their kids, their friends, their creditors and, chiefly, themselves.

Her rival Adrienne Rich, three years her elder, died just last year. But how could Plath live to comb gray hair? Her suicide does not seem like something that just happened to happen. In her poetry, she forces us to see her death as a destiny and a culmination: “The woman is perfected. / Her dead /Body wears the smile of accomplishment, / The illusion of a Greek necessity,” she wrote in her last poem, “Edge,” just six days before she died.

The second thing you learn is how seriously he takes his taking seriously of literature. There’s a striking moment in the closing pages of his new book, “How Literature Saved My Life,” when he tells us that he is interested only in literature that obliterates the boundary between life and art. “Acutely aware of our mortal condition,” he writes, “I find books that simply allow us to escape existence a staggering waste of time (literature matters so much to me I can hardly stand it).” If there were such a thing as a quintessentially Shields­ian pronouncement, this may be it, with its odd tonal mixture of the bombastic and the beseeching.

Boorstin had a point. Scholars of other fields do often tend to underestimate the influence of technology. Although most of us know that World War II brought us radar, the literature of that titanic conflict is by no means exempt from this phenomenon. For instance, the biographer Joseph P. Lash subtitled his 1976 wartime account of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill “The Partnership That Saved the West,” in response to which I once heard a British scholar carp, “If Lash is right, then why did all those scientists and intelligence officers and factory workers bother working so hard?”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/books/review/engineers-of-victory-by-paul-kennedy.html

The first depicts weekly attacks in Iraq from early 2004 to mid-2010, the second civilian deaths from January 2006 to May 2010. The graphs present identical images: bad news getting worse until early 2007, then pronounced improvement. The message is clear: In early 2007 a decided turn occurred.

An obliging parent may be asked to read it a hundred times. Nay, a thousand times. The big-eyed sheep that seemed so cute while you were flipping through pages in the store soon begins to vex. Over time, reading the book becomes like ripping off a Band-Aid. Even small defects — an irritating drawing, the misuse of the word “presently,” a character who speaks in rhyme — can form blisters on the parental soul. No, darling, not again.

When I was very young, working in my grandfather’s corner grocery in West Virginia, I would sneak on top of the giant freezers and hide so I could watch folks come in and out, listening to what they said, what they didn’t say, my grandfather at the register in his apron, smoking, or in the back making ‘hamburg’ from an entire side of beef. (After breaking down the cow, cleaver in hand, he’d flex his biceps and dare me to hang off of it.) I remember feeling like everything I was watching was operatic somehow. Like I was privy to secrets. I knew even then that if I kept quiet and paid attention, my world would be filled with stories. That this suggestion of boundless possibility happened in a tar-strip-road factory town was an additional gift. Stories that count are everywhere, all the time.

The answer is obvious; the challenge, however, is actually achieving a flawless, even-toned face that looks completely natural. Want Ryoke’s advice? Put down the foundation brush, forget about using your fingertips and opt for her favorite skin-perfecting tool: the Beautyblender cosmetic sponge. Designed to be used in a dabbing motion, “It gives you the effect of actual skin texture, so it amazingly looks like you’re not wearing anything,” she says. In addition, its rounded egg-shape allows you to blend makeup without leaving behind a single streak. For the Costello Tagliapietra runway show yesterday, Ryoke gave the models’ faces a slightly dewy finish by first wetting the sponge with mineral water. “I’m quite lazy, and the sponge does all the work,” she says with a laugh.",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/backstage-beauty-report-beautyblender-cosmetic-sponge/

Below are corporate profits (after tax and inventory valuation adjustment) and nonresidential fixed investment (roughly speaking, business investment), both measured as shares of GDP.

Business investment isn’t actually all that low; you expect it to be relatively weak in a weak economy with excess capacity, but in fact it’s about as high a share of GDP as in the middle Bush years. What’s really out of line with previous experience is the level of corporate profits, which is arguably serving as a kind of sinkhole for purchasing power.",Opinion,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/profits-and-business-investment/

Universal Pictures backed this relatively inexpensive comedy (budget: $35 million) with a deft ad campaign; billboards, for instance, featured a smiling Jason Bateman with the slogan “Is this the face of a sucker?” plastered across his forehead. And audiences responded, overlooking sharply negative reviews. The movie’s increasingly popular female lead, Melissa McCarthy, also helped turn out ticket buyers, particularly in the Midwest, analysts said. Making the film’s large debut even more impressive: Universal estimated that the gigantic winter storm that struck the Northeast on Friday took a 10 percent bite out of sales.

There never was any civilized nation of any other complection than white, nor even any individual eminent in action or speculation.”Hume had not heard of Amo, that much is clear. But we can also detect a tremendous difference between Hume’s understanding of human capacities and that of Kraus: the author of Amo’s dedicatory letter doesn’t even consider the possibility of anchoring what individual human beings are capable of doing to something as arbitrary as “complection.” For Kraus, Amo represents a continent and its long and distinguished history; he does not represent a “race.”",Opinion,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/why-has-race-survived/

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: “Is ‘Shame’ the name of something Brandon does feel, or of something the filmmakers think he should feel? The movie, for all its displays of honesty (which is to say nudity), is also curiously coy. It presents Brandon for our titillation, our disapproval and perhaps our envy, but denies him access to our sympathy.

2013-02-11,The Pope Abdicates,The implications of Benedict’s resignation.,"During his pontificate and the years of influence that preceded it, Benedict XVI was often stereotyped as an arch-traditionalist, but his next-to-unprecedented decision to abdicate the papal throne may be one of the most striking concessions to modernity a recent pope has made. His statement of resignation basically acknowledges as much, citing the realities of “today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith” as a particular reason why greater “strength of mind and body” than he now possesses is required of the successor to Saint Peter. These lines are an implicit nod not only to the particular challenges facing his pontificate, but also to the vast changes that mass media and global travel have wrought in the papacy’s role. Now that “globetrotting face of Catholicism” and “media-savvy C.E.O. of a controversial brand” have been added to the theological and administrative obligations inherent in the office, the burdens of age are arguably more of an impediment to papal effectiveness than ever before, and the mix of stasis and confusion created by a pontiff’s slow decline can have more immediately disastrous effects than they might have had in an era when papal incapacity could be a Roman secret rather than a global spectacle.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/the-pope-abdicates/

The documentary, by the Israeli director Dror Moreh, consists of interviews with six former heads of the Israeli internal security service, Shin Bet, whose astonishingly frank, sometimes harrowing testimonies reveal untold truths about events like the Kav 300 affair and the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as well as their own moral conflict — and mounting frustration — over their government’s position. “Regardless of their political views,” Moreh said of his subjects, “they all agree it’s time to put an end to the occupation. Enough!” For the director, the film’s Israeli release holds even greater significance than the Oscar nod; he wishes it could change public opinion in his country. He has reason to be optimistic.

That just about covered the terrain of his advice. My mother emptied his ashtrays for 30 years, then didn’t speak to him for another 30.) But like any sentimental son, I sought to turn into wisdom the advice my father was too much himself to heed. And where my dad was merely trying it on, Baudelaire was for real. At an early age I developed, like him, a completely French sensitivity to the scent of skin and floating clothes.

Recent biographies similarly abound, varying in aim and quality: Lord David Cecil’s elegant and unassuming “portrait” in 1978; Park Honan’s scrupulous ­“cradle-to-grave” history in 1987; Claire Tomalin’s brisk, superlative “life” and David Nokes’s lengthier, more imaginative account, both in 1997. (Carol Shields’s regrettable hash, published in 2001, is perhaps best forgotten.)

2013-02-15,Cape Fear,André Brink imagines the life of a slave who was owned by one of his ancestors.,"“Philida” is the latest offering from the South African author A­ndré Brink, whose anti-­apartheid novels — along with those of such contemporaries as Nadine Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee — have challenged readers to reflect on the intimate brutalities of a society founded on a dehumanizing ideology. Like several of Brink’s historical novels, “Philida” probes South Africa’s more distant sordid past, animating real figures from the Cape Colony’s days of white settlement, when the enslavement and indentured servitude of local black and indigenous populations, as well as people brought over from the Dutch East Indies, were entirely routine.

It can’t be reduced to its technical components, whatever they are. It’s metaphysical, yet without fixed or transcendent meaning. It’s a crystal ball, without any clairvoyance. Who hasn’t arrived at the logically borne-out if senseless belief that in the oceanic swell of Google lies hidden the answer to one’s most private problem? In his latest book, “Four New Messages,” Joshua Cohen takes on the experiential properties of the “online” modality, its textures and tautologies, its effects on language and thus on humans and meaning. This seems at once a fundamental and ambitious place to begin mapping this void of a thing that we pretend, by not writing about it in literature, doesn’t have much place in life, when the dirty truth is otherwise.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/books/review/four-new-messages-by-joshua-cohen.html

Naming Marianne Faithfull and Joan Jett as the muses for the smoky-eyed, monochromatic look, Nars says the process of arriving at this concept was quite easy: “We both love the ’60s and ’70s era. There were so many great characters at that time!” The focus on black-and-white tones not only referenced the punk-rock chic inspiration, but was also a practical consideration. With the first part of the runway show taking place under a sepia glow, Nars needed to come up with an idea that would look striking in both types of lighting. “So we did a black smoky eye with white pencil used on the inner rim to make the eyes pop and look bigger, and the eyebrows are strong and defined,” he says. “The skin is totally matte, and at the last minute I put a little grease on top of the eye makeup and clear gloss on the lips so it looks like the girl went out, stayed out all night and got her makeup a little sweaty.”",T Magazine,https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/backstage-beauty-report-marc-jacobs-3/

The Associated Press quoted Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi as saying the export ban would last for six months. But it was unclear whether the move, which he announced Friday, would reduce domestic prices, particularly in time for Nowruz, the coming New Year holiday when pistachios are in especially high demand. It was also unclear to what extent the higher price reflected the declining value of the rial, Iran’s currency, which has been weakened by the effects of Western sanctions and what critics call the government’s economic mismanagement. The chairman of Iran’s chamber of exports, Asadollah Asgaroladi, was quoted by the Fars News Agency as calling the export moratorium a mistake that would do little to ease the price and probably cost Iran more than $500 million in lost export revenue.

2013-02-16,Colombia: Rebels Release Captives,The country’s largest guerrilla group released two police officers it had taken captive in an action that appeared to have briefly threatened the group’s peace talks with the government.," The country’s largest guerrilla group on Friday released two police officers it had taken captive in a recent action that appeared to have briefly threatened the group’s peace talks with the government. The police officers were captured by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in January, shortly after the group ended a two-month unilateral cease-fire. Government peace negotiators reacted angrily to the officers’ capture and the FARC quickly promised to release them. The FARC and the government began talks last fall to end their nearly 50-year war. Also on Friday, another rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, released five mining company contractors it kidnapped last month, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which assisted with the release. In a Twitter post President Juan Manuel Santos criticized the ELN for not also releasing a Canadian captive.

The president proposed a $1 billion investment to build a new National Network for Manufacturing Innovation to spur high-tech manufacturing in America.

Yet sitting up there in the balcony listening to the president’s speech was the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook. Apple is currently sitting on $137 billion of cash in the bank. There are many reasons Apple has not spent its cash hoard, but I’ll bet anything that one of them is the uncertain economic and tax environment in this country. Think about how much better we’d all be if Apple, and the many other companies sitting on cash, felt confident enough in the future to spend it. These are the most dynamic companies in the world.

Called New Directions, the course consists of 11 weeks of classroom refresher training and then an 11-week internship working as a lawyer in any of a number of settings, including law firms, government and nonprofit agencies and corporate offices. Pace offers two sessions a year, typically of 12 to 18 lawyers each. About 95 percent are women, and the average age is about 50. To date, 150 people have completed the training, with about half going on to paying jobs as lawyers. The cost is $7,000; participants may qualify for retraining grants of up to $3,000 from the United States Department of Labor. Another school offering a similar program includes the American University Washington College of Law Lawyer Re-Entry Program. That course is six days, spread over three weeks, and costs about $1,500; there are no internships.",Booming,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/booming/from-stay-at-home-moms-to-back-to-work-lawyers.html

In January, Washington formally recognized Somalia’s government for the first time since 1991. ",World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/world/africa/somalia-us-promises-more-food-aid.html

The dozen or so young actors and musicians and others were recent initiates of Transcendental Meditation, a trademarked form of relaxation that involves sitting quietly and saying a mantra to yourself for 20 minutes twice a day. T.M. initiation — a multiday instruction program that includes the bestowing of a secret personalized mantra — costs, on average, $1,000.

Not only do they shut themselves off from family in what the novelist Jamaica Kincaid calls “the infernal room” from which their stories come, but, worse still, those stories are quite likely to deal one day with the dreams, terrors, tics and moral lapses of their loved ones. There’s a reflex in every writer that trumps even the maternal instinct, a part of her that, even while her newborn suckles at her breast, is cold-eyed, choosing words to describe the pit-bull clamp of its gums, the crusted globe of its skull, with the same dispassion with which she might describe fellow passengers on a bus.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/books/review/see-now-then-by-jamaica-kincaid.html

As James Lasdun discovers in this smart, rigorous and beautifully written memoir about being on the unwelcome end of someone else’s attention, it’s not always easy to determine that precise moment when the already peculiar relationship between a creative writing student and a teacher starts to go horribly wrong. Sometimes, the student might just be a bit too conscientious about doing the homework — and that homework turns out to be you.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/books/review/give-me-everything-you-have-by-james-lasdun.html

That sea — wide, deep and often treacherous — is what remains of the British Empire for historians to trawl, though few attempt to chart the whole of it in one relatively compact volume. Darwin managed something similar with his previous books “The Empire Project: The Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830-1970” and “After Tamerlane: The Global History of Empire Since 1405” — emerging from the imperial brine with poise and balance where lesser historians would have beached themselves like lost whales or glugged down to the depths, tangled in the tentacles of a giant squid. In “Unfinished Empire,” he turns his attention to the British Empire’s why, who and how: small words that signify very big questions.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/books/review/unfinished-empire-by-john-darwin.html

Impersonal bureaucracies and brutal industrial processes serve less as backdrops than as the central obsessions of the book, which moves us through the munitions factories and killing fields of World War I, a psychiatric hospital and a creepily gentrified modern London where those who can’t afford exorbitant rents are ruthlessly pushed out. In this world, people are as disposable as umbrellas, which are “never contracted for, only mysteriously acquired, to be fleetingly useful, then annoying and cumbersome before eventually being lost.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/books/review/umbrella-by-will-self.html

In Communist East Germany, she bravely chronicled life under a dictatorship in novels like “Divided Heaven” and “The Quest for Christa T,” acts of nuanced dissent that earned her surveillance by the secret police, the Stasi. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, she welcomed the collapse of the Communist government. Four years later, however, Wolf’s reputation was stained by a shocking revelation: she had collaborated with East German intelligence officers in the early 1960s.

(ABC) DREAMGIRLS (2006) Three Detroit singers, portrayed, above from left, by Anika Noni Rose, Beyoncé Knowles and Jennifer Hudson, discover the price of fame in Bill Condon’s adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same title. Jamie Foxx plays the musical entrepreneur who trades in Effie White (Ms. Hudson, in her Oscar-winning role), the lead singer of the Dreamettes, for her thinner, lighter-skinned sidekick, Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles). Eddie Murphy won an Oscar nomination for his turn as James (Thunder) Early, a soul man loosely based on James Brown. The film’s dramatic and musical peak — “the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie” — comes midpoint when Ms. Hudson sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic.” Nevertheless, he wrote, “the music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture.”",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html

The announcement last week that the elections would begin on April 27 and 28 and continue on May 4 and 5 set off an uproar among Coptic Christians because the overlap with their holidays would have put a special burden on Coptic voters. Mr. Morsi is a Muslim who led the Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, and the scheduling decision also raised questions about his awareness of the concerns of Coptic Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt’s 85 million residents. Almost any Copt could have told the government that the initial voting plan called for balloting on both holidays. Citing unnamed sources in the president’s office, Egyptian state media said the initial scheduling was an unintentional error and quickly fixed. The elections will now begin on April 22.

2013-02-25,"Less Innovation, More Inequality",America’s peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. A slowdown in dynamism since then has contributed to soaring inequality.,"ONE source of the outsize inequalities in America is the dynamism that made economic activity so rewarding. An economy open to new concepts and novel ventures is bound to generate unequal gains. To tax all of those gains would close off the prospects for success that many entrepreneurs need if they are to undertake ambitious ventures — a big mistake. But it would also be a mistake to misunderstand the relation of inequality and innovation. It is less innovation — not more — that has widened inequality in the United States in recent decades.America’s peak years of indigenous innovation ran from the 1820s to the 1960s. There were a few financial panics and two depressions, to be sure. But in this period, a frenzy of creative activity, economic competition and rapid growth in national income provided widening economic inclusion, rising wages for all and engaging careers for most.

But yesterday, ProPublica published an interview with Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who led the Centers for Disease Control’s gun violence research until 1996, when Congress cut its funding after intense NRA lobbying. Before the funding was cut, Dr. Rosenberg said, the CDC’s research showed that “not only did having a firearm in your home not protect you, but it hugely increased the risk that someone in your family would die from a firearm homicide” by almost 300 percent. Having a gun in the home also raised the risk five-fold that someone in your household would commit suicide.",Opinion,https://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/the-gun-report-february-26-2013/

2013-02-27,Florida: Court Blocks Drug Testing for Aid Seekers,A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a 2011 state law requiring applicants to undergo a drug test in order to receive public assistance.,"A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a 2011 state law requiring applicants to undergo a drug test in order to receive public assistance. Gov. Rick Scott called the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit “disturbing” and said he would appeal. “Drug use by anyone with children looking for a job is totally destructive,” said Mr. Scott, a Republican. The ruling upheld a lower court’s decision in 2011 to temporarily block drug testing because it most likely violated the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches. The appeals court concluded that the state did not show a “substantial special need” in requiring that applicants be tested when no suspicion of drug use was evident. The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida sued the state over the policy on behalf of a Navy veteran, Luis Lebron. “The state can’t do what it wanted to do to me and my family without reason or suspicion,” Mr. Lebron said. “I’m glad that the court agreed.” ",U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/us/florida-court-blocks-drug-testing-for-aid-seekers.html

2013-02-28,The Magical Realism of Norwegian Nights,How the Arctic light delineates the world.,"It was in the late ’80s that I saw the northern lights for the first time. I was 18 and had moved to an island in the far north of Norway to take a job as a teacher in a little school in one of the small villages up there. The village was located in the shadow of a steep, barren mountain chain, looking out on the Atlantic Ocean. Fewer than 300 people lived there, and almost all of them were involved in fishing, either as fishermen on small vessels, or as workers in the fish warehouse. It was an exposed place. One night a roof was ripped off and a camping trailer was overturned by high winds; some of the buildings had been fastened to guy wires. Everything came from the sea: the wind, the clouds, the rain, the waves and the fish, which were at the center of village life. Few of the houses had gardens; there was no buffer between civilization and nature. When you opened the door, it felt as if you were stepping out into nature, and that left its mark on the people who lived there. The social life was different from what I was used to; it was more raw and much more direct, but also warmer and more inclusive. Maybe because that’s all there was — a few clusters of buildings near the sea — and those who lived there were dependent on one another. A decade later I wrote a novel set in that place, and what stayed with me — aside from the odd social reality, in which, after only a few days, I became mercilessly entangled — what settled as a memory in my body was the light.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/magazine/the-magical-realism-of-norwegian-nights.html

And in 2010, the new Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport opened just north of the city, making the trip south even easier.

2013-02-28,The Brutal Years,"In “Sticks and Stones,” Emily Bazelon charts the experiences of a few bullied children and synthesizes the scholarship on how to contain or prevent such harm.","The question of whether humans are becoming more brutal or more civilized has been debated urgently by the Athenians, the philosophers of the Renaissance, the Victorians and the existentialists. Those who argue that cruelty is currently becoming more acute point to the Rwandan genocide, global warming, and the malicious acts of selfish corporations and corrupt politicians. Contrariwise, others point to a safer and kinder society of greater prosperity and less prejudice against social, religious and ethnic minorities; Steven Pinker’s 2011 book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature,” proposes that we live more peaceably now than ever before. The dichotomous argument has particular resonance in the context of childhood. Teachers no longer routinely hit students; laws require accommodations for young people with learning disabilities; parents keep watch for teachers’ abuse and vice versa; developmental therapists are around every corner. Yet the Internet has unleashed meanness of a previously unimagined scope and celerity; broken households escalate children’s proclivity to launch unmonitored assaults on weaker kids; ethics are preached neither at home nor at school; and the accessibility of assault rifles enables nearly apocalyptic juvenile excess. Adult bullies from talk radio to Congress get constant airtime, and in many quarters their belligerence is applauded. Still, we are shocked when children behave belligerently toward one another. Youthful aggression has always been a problem and always will be; the pitilessness of childhood, like that of the world, is most likely a constant quantity.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/books/review/sticks-and-stones-emily-bazelons-book-on-bullying.html

This is partly because the director, Park Chan-wook, here making his English-language debut, is an internationally renowned master of bloodshed. His “vengeance” trilogy — in particular the middle chapter, “Oldboy,” currently being remade by Spike Lee — is cherished by many cinephiles, in South Korea and beyond, for its blend of visual elegance, melodrama and extreme violence.

They’re boys, mostly, dressed in oversize shirts and baseball caps and standing a few feet from one another, as young men tend to do in groups.
