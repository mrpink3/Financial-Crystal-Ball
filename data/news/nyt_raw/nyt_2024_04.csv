2024-04-04,Help! Japan Airlines Downgraded Us From First Class and Skimped on the Refund.,A couple is bumped from ultraluxury to semi-luxury on a trans-Pacific flight and receives what they feel is only a pittance in compensation.,"Last year, my husband and I splurged on round-trip first-class tickets on Japan Airlines from San Francisco to Tokyo for $13,474 each. We reserved them in February for an October flight through American Express Travel. On the same day, I also bought business class tickets for a couple who was traveling with us at $8,429 apiece. In September, Amex notified me that we had been downgraded to business class for the return flight. JAL’s conditions state that we would receive “the difference between the normal fare amount of original class of service and for the normal fare of lower class of service.” To me that means that since the difference between our first class seats and our friends’ business seats was $5,045 each, we should be refunded about half of that — around $2,522 per person — for the second leg. But we got only $941 each. I contested this with Amex Travel, but they rejected our claim. Can you help?

Step one is usually Biologique Recherche Eau Micellaire Biosensible, followed by Lait Dermo-S. At night, I’ll use Vintner’s Daughter Active Renewal Cleanser with cold water. I’m a big fan of Clean Skin Club towels in XL. I’m prone to acne and hyperpigmentation, and those towels really changed my skin. I use Tower 28’s SOS Rescue Spray to prevent transdermal water loss. Then I do three big droppers of Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Hyaluronic Serum, followed by Paula’s Choice Discoloration Repair Serum and Biologique Recherche Crème Dermopurifiante. I use Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen to lock everything in. Every evening, I cleanse and do my Dr. Dennis Gross Spectralite FaceWare Pro LED mask. I use my hyaluronic serum and, after a few minutes, apply a Tretinoin Cream USP 0.1% — my skin responds well to the constant turnover. I’ll follow with my Biologique Recherche Crème Dermopurifiante and Prequel’s Skin Utility Ointment as an occlusive layer. As needed, I use Cosmelan 2 Maintenance Cream for a spot treatment and Biologique Recherche Masque Visolastine+ as a hydrating mask. SK-II Treatment Masks are just good to have in the fridge. I’m a devotee at the temple of Vanessa Lee from the med spa the Things We Do. I did a Cosmelan peel last winter and it took away 80 to 90 percent of my hyperpigmentation.

I was so into it. I’d just shown in the Venice Biennale, and I wasn’t ready to not make something ambitious,” she says. But the fire forced her to shift formats and work on a smaller scale. Those limiting conditions, somewhat ironically, led to her creating perhaps one of her best known bodies of work, “DeLuxe” (2004-5), a collection of 60 absurdist images composed of vintage clippings from African American magazines such as Ebony, Our World and Sepia. She made collages of the cutouts and turned them into photogravures, a printing process that smoothed the various clippings into one flat image. Then she repeated the process, adding new images atop the existing prints and creating a layered, rich composition. “I love the idea that you can both destroy and maintain the archive,” she says.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/t-magazine/ellen-gallagher-stedelijk-museum.html

Romero: Interviews.” “You have to be sympathetic with the creatures because they ain’t doin’ nothin’. They’re like sharks: They can’t help behaving the way they do.” Romero had good reason to like the zombies — they gave him a career, and a legacy. He memorably dramatized the exploits of the undead in the 1968 chiller “Night of the Living Dead,” the first of six films in his “dead” cycle (which continued through his final film, “Survival of the Dead” in 2010). The second of those films, “Dawn of the Dead,” was released in the United States 45 years ago this month, an anniversary marked by revival screenings at theaters and drive-ins around the country (including the New York outposts of the Alamo Drafthouse and both locations of the Nitehawk Cinema). It remains one of the most influential (and profitable) horror films of all time, prompting a slew of imitators here and abroad, as well as a hit 2004 remake that led to another zombie boom (still underway, via “The Walking Dead” and its endless spinoffs).",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/movies/dawn-of-the-dead-anniversary.html

There are the iconic photographs of Didion taken by Julian Wasser in 1968, commissioned for a profile in Time — particularly one in which she’s smoking while leaning against her Stingray, cooler than anyone has ever been, a vibe echoed in the 2003 ad Didion shot for the fashion brand Celine. And, of course, there’s her most famous line — “We tell ourselves stories in order to live” — which opens “The White Album” and is frequently invoked, wrongly, for inspiration.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/article/joan-didion-best-books.html

In 1576, Christophe Plantin ran a prestigious printing business (one of the continent’s largest) in the center of the city, a half-mile from where, a few decades later, the painter Peter Paul Rubens would build his own studio and semicircular sculpture hall, modeled after the Pantheon. Over the years, while other long-established port cities like Venice and Barcelona evolved into throbbing tourist centers, Belgium’s second city largely kept far away from the spotlight, yet it’s always quietly maintained a reputation as a place for innovation and creative expression.
