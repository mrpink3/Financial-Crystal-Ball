James Lovell, intend to doff their silver spacesuits and continue the 14-day flight in regulation Air Force long johns. Long practiced by Russian cosmonauts, the so-called ‘‘shirt-sleeve’’ flight was not to become a part of the U.S. space program until the three-man Apollo spacecraft begin flying in 1967. Behind the change in plans is the absolute confidence that Gemini’s pressure hull will not expose the astronauts to the vacuum of space.

2015-11-02,Michel Houellebecq’s ‘Submission’,"Karl Ove Knausgaard reviews Michel Houellebecq’s new novel, which imagines France as a Muslim state in 2022.","Before I begin this review, I have to make a small confession. I have never read Michel Houellebecq’s books. This is odd, I concede, since Houellebecq is considered a great contemporary author, and one cannot be said to be keeping abreast of contemporary literature without reading his work. His books have been recommended to me ever since 1998, most often “The Elementary Particles,” by one friend in particular, who says the same thing every time I see him. You have to read “The Elementary Particles,” he tells me, it’s awesome, the best book I’ve ever read. Several times I’ve been on the verge of heeding his advice, plucking “The Elementary Particles” from its place on my shelf and considering it for a while, though always returning it unread. The resistance to starting a book by Houellebecq is too great. I’m not entirely sure where it comes from, though I do have a suspicion, because the same thing goes for the films of Lars von Trier: When “Antichrist” came out I couldn’t bring myself to see it, neither in the cinema nor at home on the DVD I eventually bought, which remains in its box unwatched. They’re simply too good. What prevents me from reading Houellebecq and watching von Trier is a kind of envy — not that I begrudge them success, but by reading the books and watching the films I would be reminded of how excellent a work of art can be, and of how far beneath that level my own work is. Such a reminder, which can be crushing, is something I shield myself from by ignoring Houellebecq’s books and von Trier’s films. That may sound strange, and yet it can hardly be unusual. If you’re a carpenter, for instance, and you keep hearing about the amazing work of another carpenter, you’re not necessarily going to seek it out, because what would be the good of having it confirmed that there is a level of excellence to which you may never aspire? Better to close your eyes and carry on with your own work, pretending the master carpenter doesn’t exist.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/michel-houellebecqs-submission.html

The show came to represent the brewing movement of image-based artists — those who “had a broader perspective of how we read images, and really entered the picture again, and what that means,” Brauntuch says. “Pictures” operated as a bellwether, in stark contrast to then-fashionable Minimalism and abstraction. “We came out of a time when ‘art’ was not what we were doing, which is why we were doing what we were doing.” His years in New York in the late ’70s and 1980s were spent running up the ladder alongside his friends, like Cindy Sherman, Matt Mullican, David Salle, Goldstein and Longo, whose careers exploded onto the superstar level. He counted Richard Prince and Dike Blair among his golfing buddies, too. “We played religiously,” Brauntuch says. “We also played in a poker game for decades.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/t-magazine/troy-brauntuch-petzel-gallery.html

Estimates of the number of victims vary, from about 300 men, women and children to as many as 1,600. Whatever the correct figure, very few Jews survived. Using axes, clubs and knives, the mob first killed some 40 Jewish men. The remaining Jews — men, women and children, many of them infants — were herded into a wooden barn on the outskirts of the town. Then, as the jeering crowd watched, the murderers barred the doors, poured gasoline on the structure and lit the fire. Everyone inside died. Plunder of Jewish homes followed. Peasants from neighboring villages, who had begun arriving in Jedwabne at dawn on the day of the massacre, joined in the fun.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/the-crime-and-the-silence-by-anna-bikont.html

But if you’ve read the keener reviews (or Houellebecq’s previous novels) you probably understand that no, actually, the dystopia is the contemporary West, and the Islamified future that Houellebecq’s story ushers in is portrayed as a kind of civilizational step forward, or if you prefer a necessary regression back to health.",Opinion,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/houellebecqs-islam-houellebecqs-west/

When Oleg carried some of these items home, his mother, Galina, was horrified that the conflict had come so close.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-oleg.html

2015-11-05,The Displaced: Introduction,"Nearly 60 million people are currently displaced from their homes by war and persecution — more than at any time since World War II. Half are children. This multimedia journey in text, photographs and virtual reality tells the stories of three of them.","I have two photos on my desk. The first shows a child, a girl of about 10. She is standing behind an enormous pile of her family’s belongings, which have been tightly packed for a long journey. Her face is blank with uncertainty, but she strikes a bossy pose — one hand on her hip, the other planted firmly against the bundles. Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy — her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945. Where has this girl been, and what has she seen?",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-introduction.html

The morning call to prayer floated down a dusty road and wound its way around the mostly silent tents. At 5 o’clock, Hana was still sleeping on her bamboo mat by the edge of her family’s tent, her arms folded, her hands under her head. Her baby brother and three of her four sisters slept nearby. Many mornings Hana was up at 4 o’clock. She worked in the nearby fields of Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, picking fruits or vegetables, and everyone started early. But today the truck that would take her there was late. Now came its familiar rumble, next the crunching of gravel: She stirred, her mouth twitched, her eyelids fluttered. Then she was up, vertical in one swift movement, stretching, pulling on a hat from a stash of her belongings. She grabbed lunch — a tomato, and a pita she folded around a potato — and ducked outside to wait on one of the benches in front of her tent.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-displaced-hana.html

2015-11-05,"A Take on Seurat, Unseen Since the ’70s",“Enrico Baj” at Luxembourg & Dayan includes the artist’s interpretation of the pointillist work.,"“Years ago,” says Roberta Cerini Baj, the widow of the Italian neo-avant garde artist Enrico Baj, “I remember that my daughter, Marianna, told Enrico, ‘When you see paintings in the house, you treat them like friends. When you see them outside of it, in an exhibition, they look totally different.’ And usually, this is true” — though not in the case of Luxembourg & Dayan’s current gathering of her husband’s pieces. The intimate gallery, which is wallpapered and homey, is filled with 50 works by the late artist. Among them is “The Double Grande Jatte,” her husband’s homage to and spin on Georges Seurat’s exercise in pointillism, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.” Its inclusion represents a reunion for Roberta, who last saw “The Double Grande Jatte” when it was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 1971. “I found it so fresh here,” she remarks. “When he was making it, we were in an apartment in Milan and there was a door between the living room and the studio,” and the 20-foot-long mural ran parallel to the door jambs. “It was in front of us all of the time and at the end, Enrico said, ‘I understand now why Seurat died so young, from getting bored of making all of those points.’” A quip, sure, but fitting for someone consumed by the need for change.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/t-magazine/enrico-baj-double-grande-jatte.html

The doctrine goes something like this: Western art of the early 20th century develops in a single direction, toward abstraction. Artists working toward that goal were the true radicals. Those who held onto representation were aesthetic conservatives (whatever their actual politics).Conveniently enough, the artists who broke most definitively with figuration, and who made abstract painting and sculpture into the One True Art, were living in New York — the city that, in the words of the art historian Serge Guilbaut, “stole the idea of Modern art” from Paris after World War II.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/arts/design/soldier-spectre-shaman-an-alternate-history-at-moma.html

Ivan, the gorilla, frees himself and a young elephant by communicating with humans through finger-painting. “Ivan” was a winning tale for many ­reasons: It was based, loosely, on a true story; it addressed the issue of animal cruelty honestly, but in a manner that children could handle; it was technically original, telling the story from Ivan’s perspective, in short chapters that read like prose poems. But the primary reason “Ivan” has become such a beloved book is Ivan himself. His frank wisdom about life, both human and animal, provokes laughter and thought; his aspirations — to become an artist, and to liberate himself through art — feel universal.

But hunger is, nevertheless, a symptom of poverty, not a problem to be tackled in isolation — the solution to hunger may not have much to do with the supply of food. In this rambling book, David Rieff never quite recognizes this fundamental point. Positing that the 2008 spike in global food prices marked the start of structurally higher prices, his discussion revolves around whether we should look for the solution of extra food production in technocratic philanthropy, global agribusiness or revolutionary politics.

The Maineses name the babies Jonas and Wyatt, and immediately the low expectations that come with unmet yearning give way to the more self-centered aspirations that accompany getting what you want. Fantasies of imprinting upon these inchoate beings a storybook childhood preoccupy both parents, but especially Wayne, who sees in fatherhood a chance at passing down the rites and traditions of American manhood. Still in the hospital, Wayne cradles the babies and murmurs to them as if reciting a prayer: My boys, my boys. “We’re going to have so much fun together,” he whispers in the twins’ ears. “We’re going to go hunting and fishing and I will teach you everything I know.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/becoming-nicole-by-amy-ellis-nutt.html

A mere mention of “All Quiet on the Western Front” or “I Am the Cheese,” and I’m right back to brooding again in the ocean-deep emotions of my adolescence. What is that urge, the desire to soak in anguish and injustice as we come of age? Whatever it is, Ashley Hope Pérez’s new novel, “Out of Darkness,” fills the need. Her layered tale of color lines, love and struggle in an East Texas oil town is a pit-in-the-stomach family drama that goes down like it should, with pain and fascination, like a mix of sugary medicine and artisanal moonshine. I actually had to close the book at one point to seek respite with Facebook. And puppies.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/out-of-darkness-by-ashley-hope-perez.html

And fresh stains, too, like exaggerated income inequality. Likewise, the reality of the elite, exceptional American child is hardly as pristine as many parents imagine. Our “gifted and talented” Mandarin-speaking, travel-team-­captaining, polished-in-selfies youth are often characterized by narcissism, the pursuit of achievement at any cost, toxic stress and greed: grade greed, accomplishment greed, résumé greed. Precocious superstardom is not always happy. And regular, average childhood is not necessarily a problem that needs fixing.

Backyards, driveways and rooftops take cover under white and everything is changed. Snow means gloves and boots and anticipation. It doubles your speed downhill, then cushions your fall at the bottom. It makes it much harder for school buses to reach their destination. But as three new books show, our captivation lies in something more than the break from routine and the opportunity for daredevil stunts. We make snowmen, we make angels, we build fortresses and we leave our footsteps wherever we go. After it snows, we sculpture the world around us, carving out stages upon which our imaginations perform.

The stench was unbearable. So the bodies were hosed down and the trailer tipped to its side, letting, as one witness put it, a “rivulet of blood-colored water” flow outside. A delegation of American military officers passed by, stepping over the blood “to avoid ruining the shine on their boots.” ",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/books/review/steve-sheinkins-most-dangerous.html

In a profile last year, The Telegraph noted that Cornwell has “the coiled-up, fight-or-flight air of a lynx about to spring,” a trait evident on her website’s home page, where a video shows her coolly handling an MP5 submachine gun. “I can’t imagine writing about a certain type of rifle or a type of shotgun or a certain handgun for anything, and not having any experience with it,” she explains in the video. Cornwell has been known to take her research to extremes: She spent six years in a forensics lab to learn Scarpetta’s job and went on to scuba dive, fly a helicopter and stab sides of beef wrapped in wool, all in the name of getting things right. “People now have such short attention spans that I have to try really hard to keep the suspense going, so they don’t have a reason to put down my book and read 20,000 tweets instead,” Cornwell told The Telegraph. “Crime novels are a great excuse to get people together and to . . . examine issues that affect us all,” she added. “The crime is just the party to get the people to show up.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/inside-the-list.html

And a newspaper story saying that an official desires a cabinet job, or is under consideration, is regarded as the surest path to early retirement. Consequently, it raised eyebrows in official Washington today [Nov. 8] when Robert C. Weaver, the highest- ranking Negro in the government, answered ‘‘yes,’’ when asked whether he wanted the cabinet post of secretary of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department, still headless, comes into being at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. President Johnson hasn’t indicated his choice for the new cabinet post, and won’t until early next year, according to a White House announcement over the weekend. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 9, 1965",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/1965-african-american-seeks-cabinet-post/

Charpentier, a more junior researcher, hoped to persuade Doudna, the head of a formidably large lab at the University of California, Berkeley, to collaborate. While walking the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan, the two women fell to talking. Charpentier had recently grown interested in a particular gene, known as Crispr, that seemed to help flesh-eating bacteria fight off invasive viruses. By understanding that gene, as well as the protein that enabled it, called Cas9, Charpentier hoped to find a way to cure patients infected with the bacteria by stripping it of its protective immune system.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-crispr-quandary.html

2015-11-10,Russia: Official Says Delayed Deal to Sell Iran Missiles Remains in Force,"An announcement by Sergei V. Chemezov, Russia’s chief arms trade executive, provided no delivery date or any other details.","Russia’s most senior arms executive said Monday that a contract to supply Iran with powerful S-300 air defense missiles was now active. But with no delivery date or any other details, the announcement seemed aimed more at warding off an Iranian lawsuit than a major step toward delivery of the weapon system. Sergei V. Chemezov, Russia’s chief arms trade executive, made the announcement at an air show in Dubai, Russian news agencies reported. “The contract to deliver the S-300 was not only signed by both sides, but has already come into force,” Mr. Chemezov was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. The initial contract to deliver the weapons was signed in 2007, before the current international arms embargo against Iran was established. But the deal was canceled in 2010 by Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russia’s president, under pressure from the United States and Israel. In response, Iran filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract that could cost Moscow as much as five times the $800 million value of the original deal. President Vladimir V. Putin reversed Mr. Medvedev’s decision in April, as a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers began to appear likely. But the system still has not been delivered. The hitch, military experts say, is that Russia wants to keep the unfulfilled contract as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, perhaps with an eye to ending economic sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine.

So he called on Jeffrey Deitch, the New York-based art dealer and curator who just a few years earlier had served as the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles. “We talked to Ed Ruscha, and Ed Moses, and reached out at some point to John Baldessari, and ended up talking to Craig,” Chait says, referring to the artist Craig Stecyk, who decorated the new space. “Craig knew a lot of these artists and obviously had been very involved in the Venice surf and skateboard scene, and so I think what he’s doing was very sort of trying to enhance the history of the Rose.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/t-magazine/los-angeles-rose-cafe.html

2015-11-11,Canada: Montreal to Dump Sewage Into River During Repair Work,The mayor said the city would dump about 2.1 billion gallons of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence River.,"The mayor of Montreal, Denis Coderre, said Tuesday that the city would begin dumping about 2.1 billion gallons of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence River early Wednesday. The diversion, which may continue for up to seven days, will allow workers to repair and alter a major collector sewer. “If we could have avoided this choice, we would have done it,” Mr. Coderre told reporters. After initially approving the city’s plan, the former Conservative federal government banned the city from diverting the sewage in the midst of the recent election campaign. The Conservatives were routed by the Liberal Party last month. The new Liberal government said Monday that the diversion could go ahead, provided that the city addressed concerns raised by a panel of scientists. That review found that while dumping the sewage was not ideal, it was preferable to the potential consequences of a sewer failure.

The film was an early showcase for Stacy Keach and Jeff Bridges, Mr. Bridges playing a young boxer just starting out, Mr. Keach a somewhat older one who tries a comeback. In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby had high praise for the acting and for the script, “full of the kind of dialogue that movies usually can’t afford, that defines time, place, mood and character while seemingly going nowhere.” (At 209 West Houston Street, South Village; 212-727-8110, filmforum.org.)",Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/movies/in-fat-city-boxing-has-a-starring-role.html

A report by The New York Times in September found that monitoring of suicide was not coordinated between the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, and many veterans fell through the cracks because the effect of combat exposure was poorly tracked.   After more than decade of war, neither department has the data to show whether troops exposed to combat have a higher risk of suicide, and how that risk changes over time. Because of this, veterans say suicide prevention programs do not fit their needs. “We simply don’t know enough about the effects of combat on mental health issues among service members and veterans both during and after service,” said the amendment’s sponsor, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. The measure passed as part of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016.

As I gnawed my way up the Dolomite peak of Kronplatz mountain, I had to stop every 100 yards and catch my breath. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the trek would be difficult or that I should bring water. But whatever panic and thirst and lung-burn I experienced was mitigated by the frosted clover and edelweiss and enzian, which I could see the sun thawing in real time as I walked.

The snow did not melt, and in the years that followed, storms brought even more. All around Greenland, the arctic temperatures remained low enough for the snow to last past spring and summer. It piled up, year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium. Eventually, the snow became the Greenland ice sheet, a blanket of ice so huge that it covered 650,000 square miles and reached a thickness of 10,000 feet in places. Meanwhile, in Antarctica, a similar process was well underway.

By the time he died from an overdose in 2009 at the age of 27, he had come to stand almost single-handedly for a downtown New York art and party scene that arose just before 9/11 and flourished in the anxious years afterward, known for its drug-fueled excess and adolescent rebellion in the face of a city rapidly becoming more homogeneous, wealth-obsessed and heavily policed. That Mr. Snow came from art-world privilege — he was an estranged member of the de Menil collecting family — made the narrative that grew up around him all the more loaded. He was resented, glorified, dismissed and envied, often in the space of a single conversation, regarded as a genuinely troubled, politically aware poet of early 21st-century anomie or a heavily tattooed epigone of a counterculture that lost its steam long before his arrival.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/arts/design/recalling-the-outlaw-eye-of-dash-snow.html

2015-11-13,Inside the List,Donald Trump and Ben Carson are duking it out in the Republican debates — and on the hardcover nonfiction best-seller list.,"No Joy: The Republican debates aren’t the only place Donald Trump and Ben Carson are duking it out these days. They’re also competing on the hardcover nonfiction list, where Carson’s book “A More Perfect Union” (written with his wife, Candy Carson) is No. 4 after five weeks and Trump’s book “Crippled America” makes its debut at No. 5. Both men have been here before, of course, Carson with two previous best sellers and Trump with eight (most notably “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” written with Tony Schwartz, which spent 48 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list in 1987 and 1988). So what do their books reveal about the candidates? Nothing we didn’t know already from watching them campaign. Carson is genial and bland in advancing his model of Christian conservatism; in his latest book, a paean to the Constitution, each chapter opens with a Bible verse. And Trump is blustery and vain and entertaining. Here he is discussing his book’s cover, which shows him with a stern Sam the Eagle frown: “Some readers may be wondering why the picture we used on the cover of this book is so angry and so mean looking. I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am. My family loved those pictures and wanted me to use one of them. The photographer did a great job. But I decided it wasn’t appropriate. In this book we’re talking about Crippled America — that’s a tough title. Unfortunately, there’s very little that’s nice about it. . . . So I wanted a picture where I wasn’t happy, a picture that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel, rather than joy. There’s nothing to be joyful about. Because we are not in a joyous situation right now.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/inside-the-list.html

But a storm arises as the men depart and when eventually they wash ashore their task is no longer exploration but survival. Echoes of Captain Scott’s disastrous Antarctic expedition ring through the story of the fictitious Kismet, but are never overplayed, and the Kismet’s venture slips plausibly among the other known sagas of this so-called Heroic Age of exploration.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/rebecca-hunts-everland.html

Kamikaze-style, suicidal defense will forever be associated with Japan. But it was Nazi Germany that actually immolated itself. While Hitler lived, there could be no negotiation. There would be no surrender, no repeat of the November 1918 armistice. The result was the devastation not only of much of Central Europe, but also of Germany itself. In the course of the war, 5.3 million men would die fighting in Wehrmacht uniform. Close to a million German civilians were killed in air raids and the ethnic cleansing that followed the war. Germany’s casualties far exceeded those of all of Western Europe put together. And the violence escalated as the war went on. The largest number died in the last desperate months, the worst being January 1945, when the Wehrmacht lost 450,000 — more in a matter of weeks than America would suffer in all of its wars of the 20th century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/the-german-war-by-nicholas-stargardt.html

His fear is that “we are lurching toward a capitalism so top-heavy it cannot be sustained.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/books/review/robert-reichs-saving-capitalism.html

(The new nation had a sweet tooth for the flattery of Frenchmen. That’s also how Tocqueville managed to freeload his way across the Northwest Territories.) Lafayette came over the Atlantic to fight in the American Revolution when he was 19. He went home to France and tried to be a centrist politician during that country’s upheaval. This was rather like aspiring to be a pot roast in a den of wolverines. But he survived the Revolution and the Terror, turned down a job in Napoleon’s government, and in 1824, he returned to the United States at the invitation of James Monroe. He visited all 24 of the states at the time. The tour took more than a year, and Lafayette was cheered at every stop. He survived the sinking of his steamboat in the Ohio River, and lived to help lay the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown, Mass.

2015-11-19,Syria: Truce Near Damascus Is Planned,Government forces and insurgent factions in the Damascus suburbs planned to announce a Russian-brokered deal for a 15-day cease-fire.," Syrian antigovernment activists said Wednesday that government forces and insurgent factions in the Damascus suburbs planned to announce a Russian-brokered deal for a 15-day cease-fire that could begin as soon as Thursday. United Nations officials and international negotiators are trying to hammer out a countrywide cease-fire as world leaders gather in Vienna in an effort to renew peace talks, and it was unclear whether the Russian-brokered effort was separate and parallel, or a step toward reaching a more comprehensive agreement. The Russian involvement was seen as a sign that it now had the upper hand — more so than Iran, President Bashar al-Assad’s closest ally. The truce would cover the East Ghouta suburbs that have been cut off from Damascus by the fighting. The truce would open checkpoints into East Ghouta, allowing humanitarian aid to get in and civilians to leave, according to several antigovernment activists reached in the area.

Rendered in saturated colors outlined in black, they operate in an area bounded by painting, cartooning, graffiti and perhaps video games. Mr. Grillo’s efforts bring new energy to the high-low graphic tradition that includes artists like Pierre Alechinsky, William Copley, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Sue Williams.

2015-11-19,Vilhelm Hammershoi’s Paintings at Scandinavia House,"This exhibition includes 24 works from the collection of the National Gallery of Denmark, selected by its chief curator, Kasper Monrad.","One of Denmark’s most celebrated artists, Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916), was known in his day as “the painter of tranquil rooms.” He worked during an era of great changes in Western art: Around the turn of the 20th century, traditional realism no longer seemed an adequate way to express the myriad revolutionary ideas percolating all over Europe. As viewers may observe in “Painting Tranquility: Masterworks by Vilhelm Hammershoi From SMK – The National Gallery of Denmark,” a beautiful small exhibition at Scandinavia House, his paintings convey a distinctively modern psychological complexity. But unlike another famous Scandinavian, the Expressionist Edvard Munch, Hammershoi practiced a kind of representational painting dating back to Rembrandt and Vermeer. With their severely muted colors, Hammershoi’s portraits and pictures of women in nearly empty rooms may call to mind the suavely subdued paintings of James McNeill Whistler. Although influenced by him, Hammershoi never pushed as far toward abstract abbreviation as Whistler.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/arts/design/vilhelm-hammershois-paintings-at-scandinavia-house.html

2015-11-20,Inside the List,Mitch Albom’s latest heartwarming and slightly gooey best seller is about a supernaturally gifted guitarist.,"Beautiful Music: Almost six years ago, when Inside the List asked a handful of authors to declare their literary New Year’s resolutions, Mitch Albom pledged “to read more books about hope and less about angst.” It was no surprise, frankly. Can anybody picture Albom — whose heartwarming and slightly gooey best sellers include “Tuesdays With Morrie” and “The Five People You Meet in Heaven” — settling in for the night with, say, a dyspeptic Thomas Bernhard novel? Now Albom’s back with “The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto,” about a supernaturally gifted guitarist who influences musicians as diverse as Hank Williams and Wynton Marsalis and Kiss; it’s new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. A musician himself, Albom plays keyboards with the Rock Bottom Remainders, where his bandmates include Amy Tan on vocals and Stephen King on rhythm guitar, among assorted other best-selling authors. (“We mostly listen to Dave Barry telling booger jokes,” Albom has said.) “The theme I was trying to build on for this book was that everybody joins a band in life,” he told The Philadelphia Daily News this month. “Everyone joins a band. We may not think we do, but we do. Somebody plays the lead. Somebody is the rhythm. Somebody holds down the beat. Somebody gets to solo and go all over the place, while the other person gets stuck playing the chords. That’s pretty much how it is in a family. That’s how it is in the Army. That’s how it is in a workplace. Everybody has a role that they play.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/inside-the-list.html

2015-11-20,"‘Thirteen Ways of Looking,’ by Colum McCann",The Wallace Stevens poem from which it takes its title helps structure the novella anchoring Colum McCann’s book of short fiction.,"Colum McCann has an old-school belief in the capabilities of literature. Even as au courant novelists all around him grow skeptical of the artifices of character and plot, and embrace the self as the fiction writer’s only truly accessible subject, McCann’s work continues to assert that nothing human is alien to him, that the empathetic imagination can and should go where it pleases. He has written eight previous books in which he fearlessly simulates identities dauntingly remote from his own — including the identities of real-life figures both dead and living — and in which plot performs a function that might fairly be described as redemptive. From the perspective of academic fashion it is a hoary, virtually benighted approach to narrative art; yet to judge by the enormous success of his work, most notably the panoramic novels “Let the Great World Spin” and “TransAtlantic,” its appeal to readers somehow endures.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/thirteen-ways-of-looking-by-colum-mccann.html

One hundred and thirty-nine years after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, we still cannot say his name without picturing the mutilated bodies of his men or being overwhelmed by the sharp, lingering shame of the Plains Wars and the wholesale slaughter of Native Americans.

2015-11-20,Simon Winchester’s ‘Pacific’,"A survey of the Pacific includes chapters on coral reefs, thermonuclear bombs and cyclones.","Over the decades, the British-born Simon Winchester has emerged as one of those increasingly rare geographic generalists, migrating from region to region, sharing with his readers an almost tactile sense of the earth, its history and its peoples. His narratives exist within that depressingly vast space between the hairsplitting nuances and abstractions of academia and the vulgar simplicities of cable news pundits. A highbrow out to educate middlebrows, Winchester writes books like someone telling a good yarn around the fireplace, whether about volcanoes, Indian slums or the 19th-century American West. He is an outdoorsman who knows about such things as geology and ocean sailing, which invigorates his prose in the same way as that of another journalistic travel writer, William Langewiesche, who flies planes and also sails. And he certainly has the knack for comparison. When Winchester writes that Hawaii, deep down, “in its perceived cultural essence,” still evokes what “was felt by Gauguin during his time in the Marquesas,” it is reminiscent of the British travel writer Jan Morris describing in 1960 how the smells and landscape of the Lido in Venice ignite thoughts of Carthage and Marrakesh.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/books/review/simon-winchesters-pacific.html

One imagines that this sensorial attachment to Paris was never stronger than in recent days, after the city suffered terrorist attacks that killed more than 120 people.

The very act of transferring the words of another into the brain activates the inner voice, the voice that we “hear” when we read to ourselves. All reading is therefore a vocal performance, generally just for an audience of one.

Vidal was a tireless self-mythologizer, and as his title suggests, that book is a layering of rememberings, re-rememberings and mis-rememberings. In his new, much sounder biography, “Empire of Self,” Jay Parini suggests that even the account of Vidal’s idyllic romance with his high school friend Jimmie Trimble, one of the touchstones of “Palimpsest” — the story of a love so perfect and unearthly that it could never be duplicated — was most likely a fabrication.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/empire-of-self-a-life-of-gore-vidal-by-jay-parini.html

He was arrested by Italian Fascists and turned over to the Germans, who sent him to Auschwitz — he called it the Lager, the German word for a concentration camp — where he survived partly by luck, partly because he was put to work in a synthetic-rubber factory that used prisoners as slave labor. Returning to Italy, he wrote his memoir of Auschwitz, “If This Is a Man” (1947), and worked 30 years for a paint factory while writing stories, poems, memoirs, essays, a novel and “The Periodic Table” (1975), his idiosyncratic autobiography in which each chapter was named for a chemical element and some chapters were short stories.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/the-complete-works-of-primo-levi.html

2015-11-25,How to Navigate By the Stars,Find your north. Go out between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.,"‘‘Use the stars to find the four cardinal directions,’’ says Chadd Onohi Paishon, a master navigator with the Polynesian Voyaging Society who steers double-hulled canoes from Hawaii to Tahiti and beyond without any instruments or charts. Paishon doesn’t know how to use a GPS device or a magnetic compass, but he can orient himself on land or sea with a glance at the heavens. Determine north by finding the North Star, which does not set when you’re north of the Equator. As seafarers have done for millenniums, you can determine about how many miles north of the Equator you are by measuring the distance between the North Star and the horizon. To do this, stretch out your arm. For most, one fist equals approximately 10 degrees; latitudinal degrees each represent about 69 miles. The farther north you go, the higher the star looks in the sky. South of the Equator, you won’t see the North Star but must rely on a constellation called the Southern Cross to help you find south.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars.html

Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo today [Nov. 25]. He dismissed President Joseph Kasavubu, named himself head of state for five years and asked Col. Leonard Mulamba to form a broadly based government. The coup was prompted by a political deadlock that had threatened to open a new chapter of violence in the Congo. It also was seen as an attempt to close an opening to the left within the Kasavubu government. The 35-year-old general said his move was not designed to impose a military dictatorship.

2015-11-25,Mary Gaitskill’s ‘The Mare’,"An emotionally electric triangle of a woman, a girl and a horse is mutually transformative.","Desire and damage have long intertwined, an inseparable couple, in the work of Mary Gaitskill. With her first collection of stories in 1988, “Bad Behavior,” Gaitskill staked out her territory: love, or something, among the ruins — the ruins of self, the ruins of hope, the ruins created by cruelty, both literal and psychological. In Gaitskill’s work, people hurt one another for fun, for spite, inadvertently, because they can, and (as she titled a later collection) because they wanted to. In one of Gaitskill’s most famous stories, “Secretary,” which later became a film of the same name, an alienated young woman is sexually used by her boss, but finds the encounter has an array of effects. She is simultaneously dissociated, disgusted, turned on, depressed, oddly loyal to the boss and somehow liberated. It is not right, and it also awakens something vital in her. Gaitskill’s story doesn’t prioritize one emotion over any others or draw any moral conclusions. As she wrote in a 1994 Harper’s essay, “On Not Being a Victim,” “pain can be an experience that defies codification.” In that story, as in much of Gaitskill’s work, the heroine’s ability to remain aware of all uncodifiable experience, to turn it over and examine it, is how she stays alive.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/mary-gaitskills-the-mare.html

But in 1955, it stopped making the wristwatches, which had become too elaborately wonkish to suit changing tastes. Although the company began gingerly reintroducing chronographs in the late 1980s, the final ’50s-era model, the Cornes de Vache, continued to obsess collectors. Only 36 were ever made: 26 in yellow gold, eight in rose gold and two in platinum. Now the company has reinterpreted the design. The Historiques Cornes de Vache 1955, available only in platinum, is, like the original, a sober classic distinguished by its cow-horn-shaped lugs. But a slightly wider face gives the watch a more modern, balanced look and feel. With its raised Roman numerals, midnight-blue alligator strap, sapphire-hued tachometric dial and clear crystal back, it makes keeping track of time an immeasurable pleasure.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/t-magazine/a-1950s-era-timepiece-reborn.html

2015-11-27,1940: Students Clash in Zagreb,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Radical Croatian students fight supporters of Yugoslav national unity in 1940.,"BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — An incident that carries with it a heavy charge of political dynamite occurred in the Croatian university town of Zagreb today [Nov. 27] when extreme Croatian Nationalist students clashed with a group of ‘‘moderate’’ students supporting Dr. Vladko Matchek’s policy of co-operation with the Serbs. The fight, in which a number of students were seriously wounded, occurred on the occasion of a meeting held within the university by the extremist group, which favors independence for Croatia. The university was closed and guarded by the police so as to avoid a possible disturbance, but the ‘‘moderate’’ students — those favoring Yugoslav national unity — forced their way in through the cellar and tried to break up the meeting. The clash which ensued ended only when the police quickly restored order and made a number of arrests. The incident assumed special importance in view of Yugoslavia’s uncertain diplomatic relations with a number of her neighbors. The position of this country, nearly surrounded by potential foes, resembles that of Czecho-Slovakia in 1939. In the internal situation, too, there is a parallel. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 28, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/1940-students-clash-in-zagreb/
2015-11-27,Inside the List,"Richard Paul Evans, whose novel “The Mistletoe Inn” is No. 9 on the hardcover fiction list, once heard from his fourth-grade teacher: “Your parents lied to you. There is no Santa.”","Killing Santa: Every year, around the time mall stores start playing “Frosty the Snowman” and Starbucks breaks out its red cups, the best-seller list hangs its stockings by the fire and waits for a visit from Richard Paul Evans. You know Evans: He’s the one whose self-published debut, “The Christmas Box,” sold something like eight million copies in the mid-1990s and landed him a fat contract with Simon & Schuster; since then, his cozy holiday-themed books have included “Finding Noel,” “The Christmas List,” “A Winter Dream” and “The Mistletoe Promise,” among others. Now he’s back, right on cue, with “The Mistletoe Inn,” new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 9. What draws Evans so repeatedly to Christmas? Readers prone to psychoanalyzing might find a clue on his website, where Evans describes the “tsunami of misfortune” that hit his family in 1970, the year he turned 8. “My father lost his job and couldn’t find work, and my mother began to exhibit the first signs of severe depression. My Tourette’s syndrome manifested that year and I was ticking like crazy. In addition, I wet the bed every night, made worse since I shared the bed with my brother,” he writes. “During this dark time I had a soul-crushing fourth-grade teacher named Mrs. Covey. I’ll never forget two weeks before Christmas when she ridiculed those of us who still believed in Santa with the words: ‘Your parents lied to you. There is no Santa.’ Crushed, I went home and asked my mother if she had lied. My mother frowned. She said, ‘Santa is the spirit of giving.’",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/inside-the-list.html

The Minister replied that Professor Koch’s discovery was for the present only an infallible means of diagnoses for tuberculosis, but that as a means of cure it would require years of experience to test it. There was, however, great hope that the results would be good. In any case Professor Koch has rendered an immense service to science in connection with all kinds of infectious diseases. The minister added that it was he who prevented Professor Koch from publishing the method of preparation of his remedy, for fear that it might be badly prepared and do more harm than good. The Prussian Government, he said, intended to purchase the secret and manufacture the remedy with its own guarantee, and supply it free of cost to all the hospitals of Germany and other countries. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 30, 1890",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/1890-germanys-gift-to-the-world/

As the high command announced a turn for the better in the tide of battle, Gen. Ubaldo Soddu, who went to Albania recently to take command at the front, received promotion by royal decree. Greek efforts to advance yesterday, the high command said, were stopped by a counter-attack of the Ferrara, Siena and Centauro divisions of the 11th Army Corps. In the Koritza sector of the 9th Army Corps, all was reported quiet. Authoritative quarters were denied reports that the Greeks had captured Argyrokastron, one of the Italian bases in Albania, and that Gen. Pietro Badoglio had taken up headquarters in Tirana. Badoglio is in Rome, it was said, and Soddu is in supreme command at the front. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 30, 1940",World,https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/1940-rome-declares-counterattack-has-halted-foe/

Its gossip-filled lobby was Marcel Proust’s inspiration; its cocktail bar a hub for French resistance during the Nazi occupation; its foyer a paparazzi magnet that Princess Diana traversed before her deadly car ride. But while the fabled luxury hotel on Place Vendôme has always been an independent icon, its decaying standards told another story. In 2011, the French tourism ministry humiliatingly left the Ritz off its list of ‘‘palaces’’ (a classification for five-star hotels of special character), compelling the hotel’s owner, Mohamed Al-Fayed, to upgrade. Now, after three years and an estimated $227 million renovation by the architect Thierry Despont, the 142-room Ritz is ready to reopen — complete with upgraded suites, a spacious new fitness center and, unsurprisingly, an untouched Bar Hemingway. A recognition, perhaps, that while time and technology march on, history is one luxury that can never be replaced.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/t-magazine/the-ritz-paris-hotel-by-the-numbers.html

Planned Parenthood denied making sales, saying one of its 700 health centers was being reimbursed for supplying fetal tissue to researchers, who have used fetal cells to produce lifesaving vaccines and treatments. But the doctor caught on camera spoke in graphic medical terms while sipping wine over lunch, and the videos prompted five separate congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood’s practices. Testifying before a House committee in October, the group’s president, Cecile Richards, said it would continue facilitating the tissue donations, with patients’ consent, but stop accepting reimbursements.
