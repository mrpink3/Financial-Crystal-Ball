Schlesinger Jr., in “The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society,” published in 1991 and in a revised edition in 1998.

On the wall hung pictures of Wilson’s three young daughters; the windows behind her framed a gray sky that, as I arrived, was just beginning to dim. The poem lying open before us was Homer’s “Odyssey,” the second-oldest text, after his earlier poem, the “Iliad,” in a Western tradition impossible to imagine without them.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html

Horwitz worked for Columbia University’s endowment fund; Cogan had a job analyzing consumer behavior. Their hobbies are quiet. Cogan dreams of earning a Ph.D. in philosophy someday — “after all this is said and done,” he says. Horwitz enjoys tracking various aspects of his life in Excel spreadsheets: restaurants visited, books read, jogs taken. Scrolling through those files, he says, fills him with a sort of data-based nostalgia. For years, the two men met for dinner every week or so, where talk often turned to business ideas.

Makie, her tiny SoHo clothing shop, is a secret address whispered from one stylish mother to another; its signature wrapping (a brown paper box tied with colorful ribbon and neon-hued feathers) is almost as famous as Yahagi’s elegant, minimalist and cozy kid’s wear: onesies, cashmere sweaters and bibs in sophisticated, adult shades of slate, mouse gray and stone white. In 1991, at the age of 23, Yahagi left Japan for New York City, where she opened a bakery with her then-husband near Union Square. But an old issue of Vogue Bambini inspired a new direction. “It had these timeless images of kids in outfits by Comme des Garçons that looked like wonderful school uniforms and papa’s clothes,” she remembers; she set up her shop eight years later. There, hidden like little treasures among her garments, is a selection of carefully chosen housewares — paper-thin Japanese terry cloth towels, striped porcelain bowls — that she finds on her monthly trips to Paris and Tokyo, where she also maintains a larger Makie outpost. On the days she isn’t traveling, you’ll find the 53-year-old flitting about her Thompson Street location, dressed in her signature uniform: a navy frayed-twill blazer and cropped trousers of her own design, plus a stack of gold-and-opal rings.

At the center of this action in real life was the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, a hotel and club in the city’s Coconut Grove neighborhood. Roben Farzad, whose family immigrated to the United States from Iran after he was born, grew up in Miami during those years. His new book, “Hotel Scarface,” is a raucous history of the cocaine boom as it played out at the Mutiny. (The 1983 movie “Scarface,” also set in this period in Miami, was filmed mostly in California.) “All roads led back to the Mutiny,” an undercover police officer who worked in Miami at the time told Farzad. “The druggies, the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informant, cops — good and bad — were all there.” Appropriately, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, the stars of “Miami Vice,” also were known to drop by. (Thomas even lived there for a time.)

2017-11-07,"The Lobster Club, From Major Food Group, Opens in Midtown","The latest from the chef behind Harold’s Meat & Three, and other restaurant news.","THE LOBSTER CLUB With the Grill and the Pool up and running, the third restaurant for the Major Food Group in the Seagram Building, the Lobster Club, is poised to open. Any connection between this new restaurant and the space’s former tenant, Brasserie, is tenuous. Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner, is instead calling it a Japanese brasserie. “I love the name, and it reminds me of places in Japan with similar names,” he said. The Lobster Club might suggest Japan to Mr. Zalaznick, but New Yorkers are more likely to remember an Upper East Side restaurant of that name from the chef Anne Rosenzweig. Now Japan prevails, with the chef, Tasuku Murakami, in the kitchen. There is lobster to be sure, seared on a teppan griddle, in a cocktail, a salad, and dumplings. But the menu is as much steakhouse as it is brasserie, with a long list of sushi and sashimi items as well. The restaurant, which cost $10 million to design and build and was done by the designer Peter Marino, who also created the colorful tableware, is as much inviting lounge as it is restaurant. Framed by a long, bright bar along one side with flooring that suggests Jackson Pollock’s work, some of the midcentury Modern style furnishings upholstered in pink and chartreuse are low, conducive to drinking and snacking. Off to one side is another dining room, which can be closed for private parties, done in vibrant red and adorned with Mr. Marino’s interpretations of Picasso sculptures. (Opens Friday): 98 East 53rd Street, 212-375-9001, thelobsterclub.com.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/lobster-club-nyc-restaurant-openings.html

It’s hardly original to assert that of all the ways we experience place, sight is perhaps the least important; the thing that convinces me I’m actually in Japan, for example, is never the slur of neon outside the Tokyo-bound train’s windows, but the perfume of soy sauce, cooking oil and burning cedar that is particular to the country. The same is true with Delhi: You step through the airport doors, and there it is — singed rubber, wet concrete, damp loam, roasting cardamom. These days, thanks to the ongoing globalization (or democratization, depending on your perspective) of fashion and music, many cities can look, and sound, very much alike.

2017-11-15,3 Designers Creating Clothes for Life — Not the Runway,"Independent, understated, anonymous, even: A trio of sought-after labels specialize in the sort of thoughtful, well-made garments categorized as slow fashion.","There’s a certain type of woman who is always dressed in something stylish but not fashionable, expensive but never ostentatious, exquisite yet hard to place: some thoughtful, meticulously cut piece of clothing that channels the contemporary moment while remaining aloof to trends. It’s made of pure, papery crisp cotton, supple linen or the softest Italian wool. It’s capacious and effortless, since anything too structured, too clingy or contrived, would be trying too hard. This woman tends to work in a creative field — she’s a chef, a landscape architect, an artist, a curator, an editor — and her personal life, too, has a certain ease. She spends weekends in the garden and throws impromptu dinner parties and would rather wear a roomy dress than forgo a homemade piece of rhubarb pie. You’ll never see her wearing visible logos (or even identifiable trends), but if you ask her what she’s wearing, she’ll likely name one of a cohort of independent designers who have built a business for themselves, in some cases over decades, by quietly and consistently working outside the realm of mainstream luxury fashion. These designers don’t hold runway shows on the fashion-week schedule ... if they hold them at all. They don’t advertise or market themselves. Most of them avoid press entirely.

Circumstantially, they have countless reasons, as the Menendez brothers had theirs. But as the Pulitzer-winning writer Richard Rhodes argues in his book “Why They Kill,” the popular notion that any regular person is capable of killing under the right circumstances is likely false — it takes a lot to turn someone into a killer. Even seemingly obvious exceptions dissolve under scrutiny. Pointing to a study of 27,574 muskets recovered from the battlefield at Gettysburg, Rhodes notes that nearly 90 percent of the weapons, which are muzzle-loaded and fired one round at a time, were found still loaded. Over 12,000 of them were found still packed with more than one musket ball, some with as many as ten. It’s one thing to load a weapon — no one wants to look like a coward in battle. It’s another to actually look in someone’s eyes and shoot him.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/arts/television/law-order-true-crime-menendez-murders-recap-season-1-episode-8.html

That’s thanks largely to Brazile’s vantage as interim head of the Democratic National Committee, struggling to unite fractured and fractious constituents on the left. (Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.) So it’s not surprising that she would offer her own take on what happened last fall — or that it would diverge from Clinton’s “What Happened,” which mentions Brazile only in passing and is No. 12 in its ninth week on the hardcover nonfiction list. Brazile’s memoir-slash-analysis, the cleverly titled “Hacks,” debuts at No. 6 and claims that Brazile knew all along Clinton was in trouble. “The polls were unanimous in her winning,” she writes, but “I did not trust the polls. … I had visited states around the country and I found a lack of enthusiasm for her everywhere.” Brazile says she urged Bernie Sanders to “work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster. He might find some of her positions too centrist, and her coziness with the financial elites distasteful, but he knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/donna-brazile-hacks-campaign-memoir-best-sellers.html

First, locate the tooth. Pick it up carefully, touching only the shiny crown and not the bloody root. “Don’t put it in your purse or in your pocket,” Solmundson says. Adults and children old enough to avoid accidentally swallowing a tooth — every year in the United States, more than five million of them are knocked out — can keep it tucked inside their cheek. Hockey players tend to be impatient with midgame dentistry, even in cases involving a mouthful of busted teeth. “They just want to get back out on the ice,” says Solmundson, who has a dental-exam chair in the Jets’ locker room and is a founding member of the N.H.L.’s Team Dentists Association.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/magazine/how-to-save-a-knocked-out-tooth.html

What was good about the Vanity Fair era was that I wrote so much. These days, the only place I really do my diary is on my laptop on a plane back from Davos or L.A. or London. But back in the pre-digital age, I had those black-and-white marbled composition notebooks and new New Yorker eyes (because I’d just arrived from London) and I was so wired with everything I was seeing that I had a desire to write it, share it, impart it. I love reading other people’s diaries, too: Virginia Woolf’s, Andy Cohen’s. Chips Channon was a huge inspiration to me; the Tory M.P.’s diaries through the ’30s and ’40s where he interfaced between society and politics — it’s just riveting stuff.

I tried to keep all my reading together on the shelves of an antique desk I bought years ago from a relative. I would stand in front of the growing mass of books and run my eyes over them as I waited for a synthesis to coalesce in my mind of the many worlds I was trying to internalize.

The drug is approved for human use; “postapproval marketing” is deployed to commercialize the treatments; slick ads materialize on TV; fortunes are built.

Snotty tissues are stuffed down her pants and littering the floor. She is also about to do the most important stand-up comedy act of her career. She has to deliver five minutes of material, midday, to an almost empty room. The stakes are high but simple: Make ’em laugh, and she gets everything. But, and this is important: She is not a comedian. She doesn’t write punch lines. She is really more of a self-professed “dad humor” aficionado — she laughs at farts, at dopey puns in store names.

Whether or not Irving Penn heard this advice early enough in his career to make any difference, he followed its principles to the letter — he seldom seems to have shot any subject farther away than about 10 feet. He made his living and his initial reputation from fashion and advertising photography, which is to say portraits and still lifes, while on his own initiative he made more portraits and still lifes. He respected and followed both fine-art and vernacular traditions, taking the mottled gray backdrop of early studio photography and making it his own. He discovered a daylight studio in Cuzco, Peru, in 1948 and rented it for a week, shooting locals, and then set up daylight studios of his own in Paris, London and New York to photograph people in the generally doomed small trades (glaziers, tinkers, rag and bone men) in their get-ups and with their accouterments — a motif dating back to the mid-19th century.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/books/review/photography-irving-penn-khalik-allah.html

Maybe it appeals to me because I have more than a passing familiarity with the cow udder — even if not as an ingredient. My ignorance of its culinary potential, and yours, can be forgiven. As Cosentino notes, outside Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, udders have never been given their due, on menus or in cookbooks.

Indeed, the 46-year-old has directed a wide range of fashion houses over the past decade, from his revival of the New York label Halston to the French brand Rochas and the Parisian couture house Schiaparelli. Born to a Swedish mother and an Italian father, the Milan native has an aesthetic that marries a Southern European passion for color and craftsmanship with a Scandinavian appreciation for efficiency and minimalism. His influences range from Japanese metro stations to old masters; his Instagram account (@mzmarcozanini) is an eclectic anthology of images of ’90s fashion, Brutalist architecture, scraps of vintage fabric, even children’s toys — all of which inform both his apartment in Milan and his designs for Santoni. The company had focused on handcrafted shoes since 1975, but since Zanini joined last year, it has debuted a micro-collection of men’s and women’s clothing and accessories (many of them unisex) for a sub-brand called Santoni Edited by Marco Zanini. “Lately, I’ve been very set on leaving out what’s unnecessary,” says Zanini, whose pared-down designs, such as a cashmere coat reinforced with hand-sewn goose down and a military cotton trench lined in raspberry and chestnut Japanese satin, exhibit couture-level craftsmanship. “I like things that take a little extra effort to get or to make.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/t-magazine/fashion/marco-zanini-designer-inspiration.html

My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles.
