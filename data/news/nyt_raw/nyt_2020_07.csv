2020-07-01,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Gloria: A Life’ and ‘My Spy’,A biographical play about Gloria Steinem is streaming on PBS.org. And Dave Bautista gets a pint-size protégé in the comedy “My Spy.”,"GREAT PERFORMANCES — GLORIA: A LIFE Stream on PBS.org. Actors who play well-known figures have their work cut out for them: They have to create a compelling performance that also rings true for audiences who are familiar with the person they’re playing. Now, imagine doing that with the actual famous person also onstage. That was the tall order given to Christine Lahti, who plays Gloria Steinem in this biographical play. Written by Emily Mann and directed by Diane Paulus, “Gloria: A Life” follows a familiar biographical formula in its first portion, which stages many steps of Steinem’s career — including her involvement with the women’s movement and in the creation of Ms. magazine. But in the show’s second part, Steinem herself steps onstage, and moderates a discussion with audience members about what they’ve just seen. Both parts are in this recording of the play, which was shot during a live performance. In his review for The New York Times, Jesse Green wrote that the play “would make a useful introduction to the feminist trailblazer for those who know little about her remarkable overlapping careers as a journalist, activist and ‘wandering organizer’ for the revolution.” But he added that it “does not have much new to add” for audiences familiar with Steinem’s story.",Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/arts/television/whats-on-tv-wednesday-gloria-a-life-and-my-spy.html

2020-07-02,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"We’re heading into the Fourth of July weekend, and if that means beach reading for you (whether or not it involves an actual beach), then we’ve got lots of fiction to recommend. You might like Debra Jo Immergut’s eerie thriller of midlife regret, “You Again,” or Joseph O’Connor’s historical novel “Shadowplay,” about Bram Stoker and the creation of “Dracula.” You might like Gene Luen Yang’s graphic novel updating of a classic superhero story, “Superman Smashes the Klan.” If you miss sports the way I do, then Katherine Hill’s football novel “A Short Move” will scratch that itch at the same time it challenges you to consider the physical and emotional toll of competition, especially for men. There’s also a new Ottessa Moshfegh novel — it’s a mystery, sort of — and a poetry book taking on the crimes of imperialism, and two different novels set in Japan, one of them about a murderous divorce scheme and the other about a ghost in a Tokyo park. In nonfiction, we recommend Diane Johnson’s classic biography “The True History of the First Mrs. Meredith,” along with Joe Meno’s poignant odyssey of two Ghanaian men seeking refuge in the United States.

So off I go with a raft of unfamiliar recipes to try, thanks to “Friuli Food and Wine: Frasca Cooking from Northern Italy’s Mountains, Vineyards and Seaside.” Frasca cooking? Frasca is a restaurant in Boulder, Colo., that features Friulian fare, and the book’s authors — Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson — are its owners, working with the writer Meredith Erickson. Friuli, or Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the region of Italy east of Venice that nudges Slovenia, is flourishing wine country with a particularly rustic cuisine that has some Eastern European touches. Horseradish in a radicchio salad is one example. For tagliolini al Portonat, a simple restaurant dish, the authors insist on the region’s San Daniele prosciutto, which is sold in the United States. They are keenly aware and helpful when it comes to finding ingredients. The text transported me back to the underappreciated area that I loved visiting not long ago.",Food,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/dining/friuli-food-and-wine-book.html

We see Jasper’s boarding school days in the 1950s melting into his infancy; his father’s wedding in the 1930s segueing into the elder de Zoet’s childhood adventures with a kite; scenes from the Boer War (“a bloody, stupid mess”) dissolving into images of horse-drawn carriages; then colonial plantations in Java, Dutch East India Company ships sailing into Japanese waters; finally a trading post, a monastery, a room filled with corpses.

2020-07-10,"From Catherine Opie, a Visual Diary of the Recent Past",The celebrated photographer shares her snapshots of a time of togetherness.,"The photographer Catherine Opie has always been interested in the subversively domestic. In one of her best-known early works, “Self-Portrait/Cutting” (1993), her naked back is carved with a still-bleeding childlike drawing of a home, two women stick-figures in the foreground. That image, now in the Guggenheim’s permanent collection, nods to the queer B.D.S.M. scene in which Opie found community in the ’90s, while capturing the painful longing she felt for a family of her own. Queer domesticity was a radical thing to envision at the time, but three decades later, the pandemic has confined Opie to the Los Angeles home she now shares with her wife, Julie Burleigh, and their 18-year-old son, Oliver. Their daughter, Sara, whom Julie had when she was young, and their 6-year-old grandson, Joaquin, visit often, though for the first few months of quarantine, even that was off-limits. The house has art scattered across the mantles and climbing up to the high ceilings, some of it from famous friends, and some, like the children’s drawings on the fridge, simply a reminder that once it arrives, family grows as unwieldy and resilient as the 90-year-old Aleppo pine tree in the yard.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/t-magazine/catherine-opie-photos.html

Different regions developed dozens of patterns, of which Futatsuya knows more than 100; his two favorites are asanoha (six-pointed stars) and shippo (overlapping circles). Since 2017, he has spent hundreds of hours covering jeans he owns in stitched patterns to make them stronger.

At a settlement in the Oregon Territory in the mid-19th century, two men set up shop on a patch of ground. Their product, fried dough with modest garnish, sells out almost instantly.

The glamour wasn’t wasted on Marant, but she had her own ideas. “That era of ’80s super-chic French fashion was really getting on my nerves,” she says. “By 10, I knew exactly what I wanted to wear, but it didn’t exist in any shop.” So she started making her own clothes, reworking her dad’s castoff dressing gowns, sweaters, vintage military fatigues and silk slippers. At one point she thought she might study economics or become a veterinarian, but her friends loved her creations and kept requesting versions for themselves. After studying fashion design at Paris’s Studio Berçot, Marant launched Twen, a knitwear and jersey line, with her mother in 1989. “I was determined to work for myself,” she says. Her eponymous label debuted five years later, with a collection of men’s-wear-inspired overcoats and striped suits that drew from Indonesian batiks and ikats. Her credo was simple: She’d only design pieces she herself would wear. “To this day,” says Marant, 53, “nothing leaves the workshop without me trying it on.”",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/t-magazine/isabel-marant.html

The Dodger first baseman was standing in a packed Yankee Stadium about to hear the national anthem. From a distance, the tableau can seem an inspiring inflection point: the first Black major leaguer in the 20th century playing in the first televised World Series. “There I was,” Robinson recalled in his 1972 memoir “I Never Had It Made: An Autobiography,” “the Black grandson of a slave, the son of a Black sharecropper, part of a historic occasion, a symbolic hero to my people.” So far, so good: The safe narrative of Robinson-as-stoic-hero is intact. “The band struck up the national anthem,” he wrote. “It should have been a glorious moment for me as the stirring words … poured from the stands.” Yet if we see the scene through Robinson’s eyes — and hear the anthem through his ears — we encounter an altogether different story. Writing a quarter of a century after the 1947 World Series, Robinson observed, “I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a Black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.”",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/books/review/jackie-robinson-inner-struggle.html

That people like Young and Zazeela can still be found in TriBeCa in 2020 is nothing short of remarkable. Young is certainly the lone musician alive today who can claim to be no more than two degrees removed from three of the greatest icons of 20th-century modern music: Igor Stravinsky (who taught Robert Stevenson, the musicologist who was Young’s mentor in college), Charlie Parker (who played with the saxophonist Lee Konitz, with whom Young himself played as a session musician in Los Angeles) and Lou Reed (who co-founded the Velvet Underground with one of Young’s bandmates, John Cale). He is often considered the founder of minimalist music, having stripped composition down to its bare elements of rhythm, sound and tempo as early as the late ’50s. His compositions can alternate between abrasive (the 30-minute-long “Day of Niagara,” recorded in 1965 with Zazeela, along with Cale and sometime Velvet Underground collaborators Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise, is a loud score that sounds not unlike an airplane engine and predated the noise rock of Reed’s “Metal Machine Music” and other staples of early punk by about a decade) and hauntingly beautiful (such as 1958’s “Trio for Strings,” a three-hour piece that effectively created the language of minimalist music through the use of sustained tones punctuated by brief gasps of silence). In the 1960s, he introduced generations of musicians to the concepts of drones and sustained repetition and began incorporating Indian classical music into his work, about five years before George Harrison had ever heard of the sitar.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/t-magazine/la-monte-young.html

This was many years before he’d leave to study painting at the prestigious Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in the late ’80s, and decades before Sotheby’s would sell his work “Knife Behind Back” (2000) for $25 million in 2019. Back then, in the 1960s and ’70s, he was a latchkey kid who whiled away the afternoons playing in an abandoned ammunition depot on a former Japanese Imperial Army site. At night, he’d listen obsessively, either using the family radio or one he’d built himself at age 8, to the Far East Network, an American station that served the area with news and tunes. Over these airwaves, he found Western music. Folk music. Rock music. He heard voices in a strange foreign language — English — and because he couldn’t understand the lyrics, these voices became just another sound alongside the guitars. And so he became an improbable, insatiable witness to Western pop’s evolution from the flower-child bliss of the mid-60s to the ecstatic thrash of late ’70s punk.",T Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/t-magazine/yoshitomo-nara.html

Nail biting tends to begin in childhood and adolescence, but researchers estimate that as much as 30 percent of Americans are chronic nail biters. Often a form of self-soothing, the disorder can, over time, disrupt the functioning of a brain’s reward circuitry.

Some Smoky Eggplant Will Fix That,These crispy-silky croquettes rise to the restaurant level of cooking we’ve been missing.,"Lately I’ve been worn out by my own home cooking. It’s not the toil that’s getting to me; it’s more that I feel fatigued by the familiarity of it: the predictability of my own kitchen habits, the recognizability of my own cooking voice, the monotony of what I always throw in my cart as I zigzag the aisles at the grocery store on autopilot. Everyone I know has had a similar malaise recently — all of us feeling rather short on enthusiasm for this monogamous intimacy with our three-ingredient tendencies and our everything-shoved-on-a-sheet-pan ways, no matter how beloved and delicious the results have reliably been. And so I’ve begun reaching for new ideas, new paths, new routes to new pleasures.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/bored-with-your-home-cooking-some-smoky-eggplant-will-fix-that.html
2020-07-29,The Mysterious Life of Birds Who Never Come Down,Swifts spend all their time in the sky. What can their journeys tell us about the future?,"I found a dead common swift once, a husk of a bird under a bridge over the River Thames, where sunlight from the water cast bright scribbles on the arches above. I picked it up, held it in my palm, saw the dust in its feathers, its wings crossed like dull blades, its eyes tightly closed, and realized that I didn’t know what to do. This was a surprise. Encouraged by books, I’d always been the type of Gothic amateur naturalist who preserved interesting bits of the dead. I cleaned and polished fox skulls; disarticulated, dried and kept the wings of roadkill birds. But I knew, looking at the swift, that I could not do anything like that to it. The bird was suffused with a kind of seriousness very akin to holiness. I didn’t want to leave it there, so I took it home, swaddled it in a towel and tucked it in the freezer. It was in early May the next year, as soon as I saw the first returning swifts flowing down from the clouds, that I knew what I had to do. I went to the freezer, took out the swift and buried it in the garden one hand’s-width deep in earth newly warmed by the sun.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/vesper-flights.html

2020-07-29,Why Is There No Consensus About Reopening Schools?,"Here’s what we know: With too many variables and too few studies, schools lack the tools and data they need to balance education and health.","Is it possible to reopen school buildings in the fall in a way that keeps kids, educators, staff and their families and communities safe from Covid-19? Is it possible not to do so without harming them in other ways? Already, school closures have set children behind academically. More than 20 million children rely on school breakfasts and lunches. Too many parents face the choice between losing their jobs or leaving their children at home unsupervised. Vaccination rates for various dangerous diseases, typically required before students can attend school, have plummeted. Isolating children from their peers exacts social and emotional costs, which differ by age group and are nearly impossible to quantify. And whether schools reopen or remain closed, the risks are borne disproportionately by low-income communities and people of color. “This is really one of the most perplexing and complex issues I’ve ever faced in 40 years,” says Dan M. Cooper, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine.",Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/schools-reopening-covid.html

It takes me back to my early childhood: the long, warm days in Mississippi when I wore shorts much of the time and the birthmark was plainly visible, not hidden as it usually is now. Though not the shape of a hand, it is the size of one, and in exactly the spot where, if you were told to sit on your hands as my mother was, you might leave a mark.",Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/books/review/memorial-drive-by-natasha-trethewey-an-excerpt.html
